Billion dollar Bond,"Having watched every James Bond film on the big silver screen since The Spy Who Loved Me in 1977.It was almost surreal to see Skyfall being made by an Oscar winning director, go on to win Oscars and become one of the top grossing films of all time. The billion dollar Bond.To think back in 1989, Licence to Kill could not compete with the likes of Batman, Indiana Jones or Lethal Weapon 2 in the US box office.Bond is presumed dead after a mission goes wrong in Istanbul as he tries to retrieve a hard drive containing a list of top agents. M is under pressure especially as it seems she is being targeted by an anonymous cyber terrorist who turns out to be a rogue agent Silva (Javier Bardem) who was once M's most effective spy.Skyfall celebrated 50 years of the Bond films in the cinemas. It also takes liberties with the messy timeline of the film series. Daniel Craig's novice spy from Casino Royale is now a disillusioned veteran, at one point told to call it a day.The film re-introduces some familiar characters after being away for a few films, a younger more hi-tech Q and a new Miss Moneypenny. There is also a new M hovering in the background. The film also references earlier Bond movies as part of its golden anniversary celebrations.Although the film contains international locations, breathtaking action, some sumptuous cinematography from Roger Deakins, it flags a bit in the middle when it needed an additional action sequence.What director Sam Mendes does bring is some character moments and making effective use of Judi Dench as she recites some Tennyson.Unusually for a Bond film, this must be the only occasion where the villain actually achieved all of his objectives!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
For a life long Bond fan this is just about the best movie in the series. Has the feel of a classic Bond movie. LOVED it. I say A,"""He knows us. He's one of us. He comes from the same place as Bond, a place you say doesn't exist, the shadows."" The world's greatest secret agent is back, but is the need for an agent outdated in today's modern world? After MI-6 is attacked and M (Dench) is brought under scrutiny by the government Bond (Craig) alone is left to find out who is behind the attack while M is trying to both help Bond and defend the need for an agency that has been compromised. I know that a review is really not needed here, being the 23rd Bond movie either you will watch it or not. I am a huge fan of the series and was really looking forward to this after hearing this is the best Bond movie yet. I have really loved the Craig movies but for some reason they never had the feel of a Bond movie to me, I wasn't sure what was missing but they didn't have the same feel. Knowing that they were re-booting the series I was lenient and with this one the re-boot is complete. This had much more of a feel of a classic Bond movie and by the end I was excited to see the next one. I got chills watching a few times and especially at the end. This had possibly the best opening and ending to a Bond movie ever. I could go on and on about this but I will just say if you love Bond you will love this, if you have never seen one then this one will make you a fan. Overall, From Russia With Love is my favorite Bond movie but this a very close second, and I think may be more re-watchable. I wanted to watch this one again as soon as the movie was over. I give this a very high A.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Back on the Bond Bandwagon,"As a lifelong James Bond enthusiast who has been extremely disappointed with the franchise's latest efforts (with the exception of Casino Royale), I was extremely pleased with this film. It strayed away from the storyline of the previous two films and I couldn't have been happier after the mediocrity of Quantum of Solace. This film has all the constituents from the Bond films that have preceded it. Big explosions, ridiculous stunts that not a single person in the history of humanity can survive, and let's not forget to mention the beautiful women that would make both genders stop and stare. So what does Skyfall have that the other Bond films don't? For the first time, we get a glimpse into our mysterious hero's dark past. Where he came from and what made him the person he is today.Although I've always been the one to say that Sean Connery is the greatest Bond ever, I can now confess that Daniel Craig now holds that honor. Sean plays the comedic, smooth, and witty Bond to perfection while Daniel plays the mysterious, dark, and lonesome secret agent flawlessly. I will always choose a darker portrayal over a comedic one because it takes a certain mindset to depict someone of that nature. One of my favorite scenes is where Bond is sitting in a bar drinking alone. I don't care who you are or what your background is, if you are drinking by yourself in a bar, then you have issues that are haunting you. Whether you can admit it or not, you are in a dark place and that is exactly where this Daniel Craig portrayed Bond is. And I love it.Aside from Daniel Craig, you have a cast that includes some of the finest actors that have ever graced the big screen. Javier Bardem plays a blood thirsty ex-MI6 agent out for revenge. His performance is equally as creepy and twisted as his portrayal of Anton Chigurh in ""No Country for Old Men"" and it is an Oscar worthy performance in my opinion. Judi Dench reprises her role as M and Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney give important and memorable roles which I won't go further into detail about. Also two prominent figures from James bond history find their way back into the story line. Sam Mendes shows why he was the right choice to direct a film of this magnitude and along with the contribution of Oscar Nominee John Logan, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade come up with a memorable narrative after the disappointment of their last collaborating effort, Quantum of Solace.I look forward to what the future has in store for everyone's favorite spy. If Skyfall is a sign of things to come, then I will remain incredibly optimistic about the future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Apart from this being my all time fav Bond film, this one is a solid action thriller with tons of atmosphere n has an old skool showdown.","I first saw this with my family in a theatre in 2012.Revisited it recently on a dvd which I own.This is my all time fav Bond film.This is the twenty-third in the Bond series n the third to star Daniel Craig as James Bond.This time Bond returns to service after MI6's servers are hacked and M receives a taunting computer message moments before the MI6 building explodes.Inspite of failing a series of physical, medical, and psychological examinations, Bond returns to the field to pursue an assassin known as Patrice n to recover a stolen hard drive containing details of undercover agents which is in the hands of Patrice's employer, Raoul Silva, a cyberterrorist seeking revenge against those he holds responsible for betraying him.I love the pre credit scene in this one, the motorcycle chase on the rooftops is awesome, the train chase sequence is adrenaline filled n the scene at The Varda Viaduct is amazeballs.The climactic action is more old skool n filled with solid atmosphere.The title track along with the picturization n Bond's fall from The Varda Viaduct is very gothic like.The abandoned palatial house, the vast moors, the chapel, the secret passageway, the isolation n the sky almost touching the ground, is filled with top notch atmosphere.This time Bond faces Raoul Silva n lots of his henchmen n a komodo dragon.Bond also faces Patrice, a mercenary working for Silva.This time Bond gets to cool off with Naomie Harris, Tonia Sotiropoulou n Berenice Marlohe.In this movie, for the first n last time we get to see Moneypenny doing field work along with Bond and later how she opted for the iconic desktop work.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
007,"The best film in the era of Daniel Craig as James Bond. Supremely well acted. The best performances are by Craig, Dench and Bardem who are prize. Great action scenes, big issue that touches past Bond and M which little is known. Sam Mendes does a masterful job directing this installment of James Bond. Realmete with this film you can compare Danie Craig Sean Connolly.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
007 reporting for duty,"It has been a long ride for the Bond series, since the creation of the character there have been 15 novels by Ian Fleming, plenty of spin-off novels, comics, cartoons and video games and the film series is now 50 years old. There have been an extraordinary 23 official films, but few as extraordinary as Skyfall.After a mission goes wrong in Istanbul, MI6 loses a hard drive containing a list of all NATO agents within terrorist cells, and James Bond (Daniel Craig) is presumed Killed in Action. M's (Judi Dench) competence is questioned and the Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee, Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) plans to replace her. Making matters worse, a cyber-terrorist targets MI6 and M personally, getting a hold of the list and causing an explosion within MI6's headquarters. An older, more damaged Bond then returns to duty to serve Queen and Country, having to prove he is in shape before going on the search to find the terrorist.Skyfall is a long-awaited film thanks to MGM's financial woes, but it delivers. Skyfall takes a darker approach as we've seen with the past couple films and it's very character driven, yet Sam Mendes and the screenwriters still provide a massive injection of fun. Like most Bond films, Skyfall starts with an incredible chase sequence in Istanbul and continues strongly from then on, including a very stylish silhouette fight in Shanghai. The action scenes sequences were pristinely shot and practical effects were at the forefront.A challenge for the Bond series has always been real-world relevance. The series has faced down all challenges, from the end of the Cold War to the War on Terror. Skyfall tackles the changing nature of espionage. MI6 is no longer the shadowy organisation that the British government denied existed; it has to face the realities of the 24-hour media age we live in and the democratic accountability that incurs.The nature of the threats have changed, Bond faces a cyber-terrorist and along with the new Q, both could cause more damage than Bond can. In the real world, we have seen what Anonymous is capable of and seen how the Stuxnet worm affected the Iranian nuclear program. But there is always a need for people in the field to investigate. As M says, she is scared of this new world because many of the West's enemies are now faceless and nationless, and this element can work in the series' favour. Versatility has always been a Bond hallmark, which is why it is so enduring.Skyfall also goes full circle for Bond, as the filmmakers reintroduce popular characters, gadgets and humour. In Casino Royale, Bond is a young man who is bold, arrogant and reckless but can get the job done; in Skyfall, Craig is playing an older Bond who is both physically and emotionally vulnerable.The idea of an older Bond was briefly touched on in the unofficial film Never Say Never Again, but that was more to accommodate a 52-year-old Sean Connery being in the role. In Skyfall there is actual thematic reasons behind it. Craig gives another excellent performance, cementing his reputation as both a great actor and a great Bond, and the script treats him more as a character than an archetype. Along with M's character arch, the film tackles a theme of facing the past so it can be cleansed.The casting of Javier Bardem was a coup for the series and we as Bond fans are rewarded with a great villain. Bardem makes out Raoul Silva to be a man with seemingly camp mannerisms, but the master planner has a very sinister delivery. He has a complex, tragic background but he is not like other Bond villains looking for control, world domination, money or even self-preservation: he simply wants revenge.Skyfall is a great milestone to celebrate Bond's 50th birthday on film, and the Easter eggs for fans aren't overbearing, but rather nice touches. The last anniversary Bond film, Die Another Day, was a disaster and regarded as one of the worst Bond films. It felt like it had to keep referencing the previous films. Skyfall features a few major references to previous Bond films: Bond getting injured (The World is Not Enough), Bond faking his death (You Only Live Twice), the gun that can only work with Bond's palm print (Licence to Kill) and a similar villain to the one in Goldeneye. But these are references you would want to find, not being forced upon you.Skyfall felt very much like end of one chapter and the start of a new one. Mendes and the writers were able to reintroduce many tropes of the Bond series and still give them a modern and believable twist. For a film that has a 143-minute running time (the second longest Bond film), Skyfall never felt like it dragged and it was an exciting, entertaining film.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Skyfallen,"The 23rd Bond film from Eon Productions starts well with an expected action-packed pre title sequence. And the title song by Adele is one of the best in the franchise, up there with Diamonds are Forever and Live and Let Die. There are many fantastic scenes and Daniel Craig is once more a commanding presence. Sadly, plot conveniences in the script, over-stylised cinematography and attempted alignment with predetermined character arcs become overpowering. On more than one occasion, Bond has the opportunity to act but instead he waits until it's too late. These are plot conveniences so that additional scenes can take place. They destroy audience trust in the protagonist. And it's not just Bond but the new Q who makes decisions that undermine character believability. In fact the whole set-up for the finale is a series of plot conveniences. M, played by Judi Dench, is once more made to fiddle with contraptions like a field agent. The actress herself admitting this is not believable. Javier Bardem (villain) and Berenice Marlohe (Bond girl) were brilliant in their roles but under-utilised as a result of the script. This film, it seems, is not so much about telling a story well but setting up for a new direction for the films. What was rebooted so well with Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace takes a heavy Skyfall. A decent action film but it can't be taken seriously.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Wow!,"This is one of the best Bond movies I have ever seen. The story is superbly put together and has some interesting twists, the action is well done and contains none of the shaky cam which plagued the last film. The actors all do a great job. Some might still be put off by Daniel Craig's rough version of Bond, but I like it and he even has a few good old fashioned one-liners here. I wasn't sure about Javier Bardem as the villain at first. I thought he was a tad too flamboyant but eventually he grew on me, plus he had a very interesting backstory and as you might have guessed already, Judi Dench is fantastic as usual as M and she even has more to do in the story this time arround. This is not a completely formulaic Bond movie. Craig's bond is still more emotional than Connery or Moore ever were and for the first time we get some relatively detailed descriptions of his childhood. And something happens to Bond in the start of the movie that affects him for the rest of the film. But despite all that there are tons of James Bond trademarks like the martini, the introduction and even Q. Some might not like this new very young version of Q but I found him to be funny and very likable. They will never top Desmond Llewelyn's original performance, and instead of making a cheap Llewelyn clone, they make a completely different character which I think is the only right thing to do. This is not only a great Bond movie but just a downright great film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"After 50 years, James Bond finally comes home!","Congrats to the production team, especially the writers and the director Sam Mendes, for creating one of the very best Bond movies. If there's any fairness at all in the movie industry, 'Skyfall' will get its fair share of Oscar nominations.THE GOOD:The precredit sequence: They spent almost three months filming this 10 minute sequence. When you see it, you will understand why.The lead actors, especially Craig, Bardem and Dench really shine, given a script which has some very interesting plot twists. Especially in the third act, which takes place on British soil entirely.Cinematographer Roger Deakins, has made 'Skyfall' the most visually stunning movie of the year. Not since Lewis Gilbert directed Bond movies has a Bond-movie looked this good. Excellent use of colors, light and locations in 'Skyfall'. And no shaky-cam (!) which destroyed the last Bond-movie, 'Quantum of Solace'.THE ""COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER"":The huge action setpiece from the beginning of the movie never gets topped during the rest of the movie. Some Bond-fans will probably be disappointed by this, since action set pieces are a key ingredient in the Bond franchise.The soundtrack by newcomer Thomas Newman: A bit underwhelming when compared to John Barry, and later David Arnold, who scored the last six Bond-movies.The return of the exact same Aston Martin DB5 presented to Bond by 'Q' in 'Goldfinger': I think this messes with the whole ""reboot""-idea.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
How safe do you feel?,"Bond 23 and 007 has to literally come back from the dead when a stolen hard-drive makes M (Dench) look bad at a time when a face from her past comes homing into blood thirsty view.There is one sure fire fact in cinema that nobody can dispute, that of there never ever being a James Bond film that all Bondphiles will agree on. From each corner of the spectrum will come arguments that said Bond film is not gritty enough, not fun enough, not enough sex, not enough action, not enough fantastical stunts and etc etc etc. Well that's fine of course, we all have our peccadilloes we prefer in our Bond movies, but we do live in different times now, the world has changed, and so has Bond. You may not get the ultimate Bond you want, but this is a 21st Century Bond and a new era of 007 is upon us, something which makes Skyfall even the more bolder and braver because it marks the 50th anniversary by blending the old with the new and mostly achieving brilliant results.Skyfall allows us to bathe in nostalgia whilst also forcing us to re- evaluate just where we are at in terms of our beloved super secret agent. One of the great things about this Bond is that there is a bubbling under current of time's importance delicately perched on each side of James Bond's shoulders. Is he (and M etc) outdated? Or is the future still in need of such operatives/organisations? Director Mendes and his team don't take any of the easy options that were clearly available to them to answer the question, they instead build a film around Bond and M as characters, embrace the traditions of the series and hit us hard in head and heart.The plot of Skyfall as written is simple, absolutely nailed on it is straight and true to Hollywood conventions, but what fills out the simple plot is a series of Bondian delights, thrills spills and emotionally splintered kills. The stunning pre-credits sequence sees Bond traverse the rooftops of Istanbul on a motorcycle and then fight on top of a speeding train. Only to then find himself expendable. Which leads to Daniel Kleinman's title credits sequence that is filled with ominous portents of death and blood, in turn backed by the wonderfully Bondian of old title song warbled by Adele. It's clear at this point that this Bond movie is nodding to traditional values whilst promising to deliver some emotional pain. And so it proves.A washed up Bond enters the fray, and he convinces, he's dishevelled, unshaven and unfit, but he's still a tough bastard who can drink hard and stare a scorpion down. He'll be back soon, we know this, and he will be in wonderful physical shape, and loyal to his surrogate mother for sure. Ah, but there's the adversary on the scene now, a villain to finally give Craig's Bond something to fret about. It's Javier Bardem's (perfect) Silva, a cyber terrorist with a shock of blonde hair, a nasty dental trick and a devilish sexiness that unnerves during an interrogation scene; to which Bond cheekily opens up some wink wink possibilities. There is other sexual tension in the film as well, not just a steamy shower scene, but the ongoing banter with Naomie Harris' (excellent) Eve that positively fizzes with smirking innuendo.But ultimately this comes down to the love between a man and a woman, the kind that is so different to the type that has so often underpinned a Bond movie. Bond will kill or be killed for M, and how marvellous to see a director really able to give Judi Dench the direction she so deserves, and Bond, in Craig's magnetic and gritty hands, responds in kind to deliver a last half hour as good as any in the 50 years of Bond on film. As we know, all turf is Bond's turf, but this time it really is HIS turf, and as a little back story comes seeping out, Bond gets to exorcise some demons whilst kicking considerable ass. Get ready Bondphiles, this has the emotional wallop only seen in the best Bond movies of old.All the Bondian trappings are still here, exotic locales, gorgeous women, speeding vehicles, fights, stupendous stunts, bizarre lairs and balls out machismo. It's also funny! I myself commented when reviewing Quantum of Solace that it was pretty ace as an action film, but for many it's not Bondian enough, and the truth of the matter is Bond still needs to have a degree of fun, no matter how grim and gritty the story line is. Thankfully Skyfall is often a blast, with Craig (surely convincing even the most stubborn of dissenters how good a Bond he is) having the confidence and skill to lace his Bond's macho broody instinct with a desert dry wit and shrug of the shoulders nonchalance. Other side of the camera the tech credits are high, with Deakins proving to be one of the aces in the pack. His capturing of vistas, be it a neon city scape or a mountainous valley, are eye delights, his colour tones are beautiful, I promise you, nobody these days does golden browns like Deakins.It's not the masterpiece that I or gazillions of others hoped for, and it does have flaws (new Q a bit too geeky safe, finale lacks a substantial battle with the villain) and it remains simple in plot, but it's Bond's birthday and the birthday boy has been done proud by the makers. It's a new era Bond for sure, but that most definitely isn't a bad thing, it knows its past and it now knows its future, and without doubt we all still know the name. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond is back,"Some people thought Daniel Craig was too much like Bourne and the Bond style film had been abandoned. If you were worried about that fear not - Bond is back.The film has great stunts & thrills - you'll see this in the long opening sequence. Bond is not burdened with gadgets and still has lots of energy.Ignore the plot credibility (not as far fetched as some plots like Moonraker) and usual level of general film fiction where it comes to computing.All the characters are great, from the MI6 team members to the villain (Silva) who acts like a traditional Bond villain. It is very easy to provide details and reveal the plot - the way the trailer was edited means it has not given too much away.This film will provide thrills & you will laugh more than you did with Craig's last two films.Classic Bond is back and it was a joy to see it, if you are a Bond enthusiast there are lots of treats in store.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Great movie,"I'm having a hard time expressing myself when it comes to this movie. It was a great movie all in all, but I feel like there's something missing.Javier Bardem played the villain fantastically, the way he spoke and acted gave you chills and made you believe that there was something beneath his facade. (I don't think it's worth mentioning that Daniel Craigs acting was good, that has already been acknowledged).After almost two hours in, I felt that I had so many questions unanswered and I started to worry how the movie was going to answer all of them in just half an hour. But I wasn't disappointed. Yet I was still hoping for something more, in a way.There was just bits missing that would have made the film so much more better (even though it was great). For example getting to know more about Raoul Silvas life would have given him a stronger role in the movie. But I believe that the thing that i was the most disappointed about was Q. Bringing the character back after a few years sure brings peoples hopes up. And I was really expecting the cool gadgets that we've seen in the earlier movies. It was always fantastic to see the awesome stuff that a 007 got access to that made the spy life seem so cool. But in this movie I feel like they under-did his role a bit. A gun responding to fingerprints is cool, but the last time we saw Q, Bond got an invisible car with rocket launchers and a ring that could break glass. Sure they try to make the movies more realistic today, but I still feel that giving him a bigger role would have brought the movie up a bit.Although I don't want to complain to much. The movie was great, go see it, you will like it and its a bit darker side than the previous films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

A good anniversary Bond,"This is one of the better Bond movies as I see it. The directing is excellent, as is the cinematography and music. Javier Bardem is great as a baddie, though he could have used a bit more background. He is over the top, but it suits the genre. In comparison, we get more background for Bond and M.The plot is good and has a good flow to it, though the movie feels ever so slightly bloated in the beginning and the end. The action is well paced and free of annoying shaky-cam work. The dialogue is witty (more so than usual), though too much of the good stuff is given away in the trailer. It definitely feels less of a Jason Bourne movie than the last two.Location-wise, Skyfall spends more time in Britain than any other in the series as far as I can recall. I like this change and it's nice to see more of MI6.In all it's well worth watching and a great Bond movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Not a Bond film, this is the Anti-Bond film","It is one thing to deconstruct a film genre, a genre that has reached the level of dynasty, to make it better. It is an entirely different matter to do so merely because you can, to show off your own power, and to leave the genre in tatters. Sam Mendes is incapable of making a film that is not dazzling to the eye. He is a visual artist of the highest calibre and possibly one of the greatest directors living today. Similarly the lead actors are incapable of delivering a performance that is less than stellar given the scripts they are handed. But the praise ends there. This is not a Bond film. This is an anti-Bond film. Notice kind reader that every task Bond is handed in the script ends in failure. Don't shoot the messenger, just watch the film. Notice that at some point Mendes became momentarily self-aware of what he was doing by bringing, out of nowhere, using the magic of film, the Aston Martin DB7 from a half-century ago, fully fuelled and ready to go, with the old Bond theme for accompaniment. But he just couldn't go through with it. The moment (the self-aware moment) passed and he went back to Plan A, the Anti-Bond film, and, in one of the most gratuitous but Freudian moments ever seen, blew the car to bits. Just like he blew the Bond formula to bits. I know what you are thinking. You thinking that an artist has license to do all this if the end result is entertaining and satisfying. True. But this film is as satisfying to the viewer as a car wreck. Visuals aside, it is hollow and leave a strange taste in the palate. Shame.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Were You Paying Attention?,"Right, let's dispense with the rubbish I've had to endure over the last few months: ""James Bond wasn't funny in the last 2 films"". Oh, yes he was, you just weren't paying attention.""Sam Mendes only ever does dramas, he'll be crap at action"". Wrong again and Road to Perdition hinted on what he can bring to the table. Plus, if you had reservations about Sam, then you're an idiot! ""Is this Daniel Craig's last outing as Bond?"" No. He's contracted to do two more. In fact, why do people think this is the last Bond??? After the hype and mild disappointment that was The Dark Knight Rises, Chris Nolan will have to contemplate that he's missed out on the Big One here. Yup, Sam Mendes, Oscar winner supremo for American Beauty was by far-and-away, the only man for the director's chair (with a solid recommendation by Craig himself). What I love about Uncle Sam is that he's not afraid to be bold (we see more blood in this film, despite the 12a rating, but it's subtly done) and he's definitely found some niches with DC's reluctant hero (which Martin Campbell kick-started with Casino Royale). A pivotal ingredient of a Mendes film is the cinematography and with Skyfall, my jaw was dropping at Shanghai (a nod to You Only Live Twice). In fact, my jaw dropped a lot (and that wasn't even Bérénice Marlohe!) And despite the absence of David Arnold, composer Thomas Newman, doesn't disappoint.It's the 50-year-old debate: Who Is The Best Bond? Daniel Craig: 3 films in & by the time you see Skyfall, there is no doubt in my mind that DC's Bond is the most fleshed-out and three dimensional. His cavalier attitude, his down-and-dirty assassin on the mission, and a very affectionate lover of the ladies, are some of the reasons he scores all the ticks. Sean Connery just wisecracked and shagged birds, but had that physical prowess which DC has equalled, if not bettered; George Lazenby was more of a pantomime; Roger Moore started out well with his debut, but romanticised 007 to the point where he wore flares and befriended steel-toothed villains who were baying for his blood; Timothy Dalton brought back the hard edge Bond was missing and very underrated (kudos to Jason Segel who acknowledged him in I Love You, Man); Pierce Brosnan carried on that darkness with GoldenEye, which was sadly lacking in future outings, along with a suspension of disbelief audiences couldn't buy any longer. DC is Bond, he now owns the role. He's comedy timing is impeccable, his reactions to the littlest things will have you laughing and he knows how to wear tight fitting clothing (thanks to TOM FORD). More importantly, DC can act which is what this role demands...and if like me, you've all watched the Bond films (as DC & Mendes did), Skyfall has done a tremendous job in avoiding past mistakes. The screenplay acknowledges why James Bond is the World's Most Successful Movie Franchise. From the opening credits that references past entries, to Adele's amazing vocals (someone shoot Madonna & Lulu for me; oh and Jack & Alicia too), Skyfall is peppered with nods that may anger or erupt knowing laughter from its devoted fan base. For the record, I laughed, quite a lot.Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva, is probably the best entrance you'll ever see for a Bond Baddie. He is also by far, my favourite villain of the series and will be a hard act to beat. I really cannot say any more about Bardem, as he is one of many high points that Skyfall has to offer. A stroke of genius from Mendes to give him blonde hair (not only did he remind me of Scaramanga) but the hair does reveal a back story. Javier is proof that grade-A actors do get the best villainous roles, if they're written properly (remember what the Cohen brothers did for him a few years ago?) As I write this, I'm still grinning at Javier's comments...hahahaha! A great actor, just love him and so much going on in that masculine skull of his.Nothing will touch Bond. Sure, you'll have the wannabe franchises out there (did someone say douchebag, toothless vampires? Not me) who will claim to be the movie event of the year (more like non-event) and the likes of Marvel Comics may one day, catch up. Stan Lee has to look at the accidental success of 007 in relation to his own creations. Sure, I love Spidey, Captain America and Daredevil, but I'm not a sweaty arm- pitted virgin with a fondness for pies and acne; I'd much rather be the man who's dressed to kill, with a Licence To Thrill and smells of the most decadent cologne that my wages will allow. No shame in admitting my inverted snobbery and can thank Ian Fleming for that. If he were alive today, I'm sure he'd approve of Skyfall (considering it's an original screenplay that relies on his healthy diet of sex, guns, snazzy wardrobes and fast cars). Happy 50th birthday, James Bond (you don't look a day over 40!)Bond will return in October 2014 (I've already booked my tickets!)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
I was bit bored,"The saga of the Bond film franchise might have moved on since the 1990s first with Pierce Brosnan and then Daniel Craig stepping into the shoes left by the former and Skyfall was his third outing as 007. The film techniques too have moved on but it wasn't always a perfect arrangement here and sometimes it gets too technical as Sam Mendes overdirects this one. It was a similar case sometimes with John Glen when he directed all five Bond films in the 1980s but the technical way of film making in that decade was very different.
On Skyfall, the film-makers again have simply lost the plot and the story is considered to be rather jumbled, very confusing and difficult to follow and thanks to the techniques, the stunts are much more lethal than ever. Even Judy Dench in her last outing as M seems to be irritating and more contemptible than ever as Bond struggles to protect her only just by smuggling her to a extremely bleak and remote Scottish mansion makes no sense. I did have some positive hopes for Skyfall and why the critics choice? But no, it just gets increasingly desperate and very boring.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

And to much delight, Skyfall is no cash-in...this is a full fledged, action packed, and thoroughly conclusive Bond experience like no Bond film before it.Daniel Craig returns as the stoic James Bond, but this time he is a more vulnerable James Bond than before. The story takes Bond to and company to very interesting places, and the set pieces that follow are incredibly memorable (partly because of the superb cinematography). The finale is especially incredible; it oozes style. Judi Dench is as classic as ever, Ralph Fiennes is excellent, and Javier Bardem is an incredibly complex and sinister: he is equal parts flamboyant and insane. The only weak link here is Naomie Harris. Her introduction is far too brief to get the time to like the character, and her humor is pretty bad. She becomes better as the film moves along, but nothing to the level of past Bond girls.The action scenes are incredibly well shot and feature some of the best choreography since the Bourne trilogy. Like before, the finale is one of the best of the series, no doubt. It is explosive, intense, thoroughly satisfying and concludes a chapter in the Bond universe. The second half of the film also brings back some classic Bond ideas, and I'll keep it at that. If you have been in love with Bond series as long as I have, ever since childhood, you'll be giddy in your seat!The soundtrack is also really great, and the new music added fits the mood well. Adele's intro song is surprisingly good. Also, the classic intro scene style is back, and it is very, very cool.Now, Bond's latest isn't without some faults. Like mentioned before, Naomie Harris isn't great. Some of the humor is really hit or miss. There are a couple of small plot holes. All of these are little things, but keep this movie from being perfect. That being said, these things won't hurt the experience for all, and they do little to mar the overall experience.Summing up my feelings for Bond's latest is simple: Skyfall is such a good film. Aside from a few nagging little issues, Skyfall couldn't be better. It's filled with memorable action scenes, great characters, impressive cinematography and an unforgettable finale. It carries that same level of cheesiness that Bond films are well known for, and that same brand of humor is back. It's classic Bond in a new era, directed with expertise and style.Bond's latest mission is a success.4.5/5 - Fantastic, a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
These Films Could Use Some Tightening Up!,"I began watching Bond films with ""Dr. No."" I have been thrilled, disappointed, exhilarated, bored, and challenged. The best Bond movies are the ones that have a cohesion, despite the action sequences. There were times when I wondered if the producers packaged these by the pound. How many ridiculous chase scenes can you cram into a space. That's OK sometimes because these films have a sense of humor and an in-your-face craziness that is a hallmark. However, it's the space that may be a problem. The later films are just too long. When a confrontation takes twenty minutes to resolve, you need a program to try to remember the big picture. This one suffers from the same affliction. While things do eventually resolve themselves, we are led all over the place where distraction is the result. I must say that I stayed pretty interest throughout, but at times I began to look at my watch, wanting to cut to the chase. I like Daniel Craig. He seems to be a more complex Bond than some of the others, but the screenplays need editing and the action sequences more under control.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Finally breaking the ""Bond formula""","For twenty-something films, Bond movies have always followed the same ""Bond formula"" (although who can blame them, it's mostly enticing and satisfying to watch: see Casino Royale). But not anymore. This is the first Bond film that captures everything a Bond film should have - the amazing score, spy action, feats of impossibility, classy and luxurious settings, a criminal mastermind, near apocalyptic scenarios...etc. yet doesn't feel at all cliché. For the first time, the tables have been turned against Bond from the very beginning: he is getting older, his abilities have deteriorated, and he is no longer equipped with futuristic gadgets we're all so used to. From there, the plot develops as a typical Bond film... or so it seems... until things really start escalating. Without spoiling much, I'll just say that the plot takes many turns that immediately sucks viewers in. Unlike many other mediocre bond films, the plot in this leaves viewers engaged and invested in the story. Moving beyond the plot, the characters in this film are also portrayed perfectly. Although some may think it's a bit cliché - a classy womanizing spy, a badass criminal mastermind, a beautiful and seductive damsel, this is a Bond film after all. And these characters are all so very classy, leaving viewers incredibly satisfied upon viewing. But what makes this film a true masterpiece is the cinematography. From the first scene to the end, the tone and environmental shifts create a surreal and artistic experience. Many shots are incredibly artistic, with amazing background contrasts, focus usage, closeups that capture the grandeur of a exemplary Bond film. Finally, the colors and tones of this film paint a truly unique experience, where the many shifts between cold and warm colors accompany the rise and fall in plot points, generating suspense and emotion to the film.It doesn't matter if you usually watch Bond films or not, I'd recommend this film to anyone who remotely likes action and suspense. The cinematography and plot are both atypical of Bond films yet excel spectacularly in the spy film genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the very best Bond movies,"We've waited four years since ""Quantum Of Solace"", but 50 years after ""Dr No"" started the longest and most successful franchise in movie history comes the 23rd James Bond film and the third starring Daniel Craig as 007. I was 14 years old when I attended the spy's first cinematic outing; over the next couple of years, I read all 14 Ian Fleming novels; and, over the last half a century, I have gone along to the theatre to see each new film as soon as it was released.What was new with ""Skyfall"" is that I managed to see it a week before its general release at a special viewing for cast and crew when all mobiles were taken off us, all of us were searched, and everyone sat through the credits before applauding a brilliant team effort.The sense of excitement was rewarded by a superb movie. A cracking opening is followed by a powerful song from Adele which is followed by a storyline that is genuinely distinctive from other Bond movies: more intelligible and more intelligent.Instead of the archetypal villain as someone crazed by megalomania, we have an adversary, subtly played by a blond Javier Bardem, who is motivated not just by power and wealth but by a very personal sense of vengeance. Instead of a Bond who easily outwits all foes, we have an agent with some obvious vulnerabilities, both physical and psychological, who does not always get his way. Instead of the usual two Bond girls, effectively we have three: French actress Bérénice Marlohe in her first English-speaking part, British actress Naomie Harris in what will prove to be a break-out role, and the redoubtable 77 year old Judi Dench playing M for the seventh time in 17 years.The film is a triumph for British director Sam Mendes, making his first British movie after such more serious successes as ""American Beauty"", ""Road To Perdition"" and""Revolutionary Road"". I was shaken and stirred.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The end of the beginning.....,"A JB movie alright. With some excellent acting and a good script. An opening scene that should get a ticket for kind of over-speed.And some last half an hour! Stays in your mind for weeks the first time you watch it.Danny's finest 007 hours on screen besides Casino, in my opinion. Some picks of humour delights the audience very well on the journey, and there's the right James Bond feeling most of the way.A Spanish guy named Javier Bardem is far out beautiful bad guy. (Can't remember a more stone cold avenging mind for decades in Bond time line....) When MI6 is forced to hide underground, you know it's red alert.One amazing scene after another, you can't catch breath for quite many seconds. The whole production team should have been awarded a ""small Oscar"" for getting this together so brilliant. And the ""Put-aside-Spectre-story-for-a-while"" works great. But it sleeps in the subs, if you know what I mean...But. I don't like the way Judy Dench (M) and 007 seems to have special feelings for each other. Blabla...I know. M never showed Pierce B that kind of sympathy!:/Church scene is kind of the ending of Return Of The Jedi; a fellow to me bringing that view. (Darth/Luke confession scene.) I don't think it suits a James Bond film...touching though, anyway.I rank this Daniel Craig James Bond 007 movie towards his other stuff. To Sean, Roger (R.I.P), George, Timothy, and Pierce's 007 stuff you got to have a distance kind of mind to enjoy them to the fullest.So I finish with my personal top 6 JB movies.

Entertaining and action-filled. A top 10 JB movie to me. Nevermind the aging of such 60's stuff.*RM: ""The Spy Who..."" (1977.) Roger Moore as 007 to the fullest. A 70's classic people today still compares to year fellow movies like Star Wars, Close Encouters, or, for .... sake, Smokey and the Bandit. Way out there, as the 70's was, and a certain '79 movie sealed it.*TD: ""The Living Daylights"" (1987.) Very hard to choose one of his (sadly only) two movies. I like both of them a lot. LTK gets to me deeper in between days, but this is more of the pure JB thing.*PB: ""Goldeneye"" (1995.) All-in by Pierce Brosnan. He new his work was important and very well sought after. The other 007's of his sadly disappears in too much merchandise. And DAD is quite silly still, uh?*DC: ""Casino Royale"" (2006.) No one could expected an entering like this. As his fore-runner, he knew that a first job was crucial. He did it, quite well.So...now I've completed my 007 reviews. Over 1,5 years since first. Got some likes, got some dislikes.

Appalled,"Both by the film's magnificence and the multitude of negative reviews for this Movie! And I'm not just saying this because I thought this was a masterful film, which it was, but because the reasoning behind these arguments is just ridiculous. From misconstruing what's actually happening in the movie to not being able to accept a change in Bond. First off, Bond wasn't made to stay the same forever, change is a real thing people, ACCEPT IT. Secondly, this is a story that's different than previous films. Skyfall is much deeper as it hits Bond's childhood and exposes his dark past. Sorry if this is too hard to comprehend so far.The plot holes that exist are minor and are really only noticeable if one is really trying to bash a film without real reason. The key to a successful film is if it depicts a moving story and enthralls its viewers, and if one does nothing but to criticize a movie without an attempt at appreciation at any level is, again, appalling.Away from the blind opposition, Skyfall is made great through its exceptionally well-acted cast on all sides, especially Dench's and Bardem's performances (I mean what do you expect). The cinematography is done exceptionally, because if Roger Deakins has anything to do with anything, it's gonna look beautiful, shown here at the Casino in Shanghail and especially in the building surrounded by neon lights. Thomas Newman is another veteran who does the score the justice that such an iconic theme deserves. The production design, especially between the Shanghai and Scotland scenes, adds to the momentous effects the film is able to create. The plot is more than intriguing, as it continues to develop and captivate the attention of its viewers more. Mendes has been an impressive director since '99 with American Beauty and Skyfall showcases his mastery is still applicable now.Do not let the negative reviews on here push you away, Skyfall is no waste of time and will create an experience that you surely will not forget soon.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"""Skyfall"" drops proudly among the greatest Bond films","Daniel Craig has now starred in the two greatest James Bond movies ever made (let the criticism begin), and although he also starred in the worst (""Quantum of Solace""), it wasn't all his fault and can be forgiven. But enough comparing, because ""Skyfall"" needs no comparison, and would embarrass its competitors anyway. Sam Mendes has delivered a riveting thrill machine of a movie, with a rich character at its heart – James Bond. That's right, the cold, calculating killer reveals even more of his soft side as we delve deep into his past. The emotional feeling we get from the famed agent is entirely due to Craig's acting, who has brought more to the psychological side of Bond than the rest of the players combined. Sure, his films may lack some of the quirk and humor of the earlier offerings, but the character is still finding himself (six years ago he didn't even know what drink to order). And trust me, there is plenty of humor, and a dash of quirk, in this fantastic entry. ""Skyfall"" gives us a compelling story that we can actually wrap our heads around, as it is nearly as simple as revenge. We get a wildly sinister villain from Javier Bardem (who reminds me of Ledger's turn as Joker, and Bardem is equally Oscar-worthy), a multi-dimensional M from Judi Dench, the introduction of Q and Money Penny, as well as some throwbacks towards the films of old. Directed by Oscar-winner Mendes and filmed with a master's touch by Roger Deakins, this is a Bond film that redefines Bond films (after ""Casino Royale"" rejuvenated them in 2006) and offers up something for everyone. Two amazingly choreographed (and photographed) action scenes and Adele's soul-stirring theme song, with the accompanying and superb opening credits, are the icing on the cake. So I suppose the 23rd time's the charm. ""Skyfall"" drops strongly in first place as the best of Bond.-Thomas Bond",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The ship is heading towards the right course but its still far from home port,"I have been a huge Bond fan for as long as I can remember, I have seen all the films multiple times. With the latest one, Skyfall, Bond is starting to make his way back to his roots but only just slightly.The plot revolves around a stolen list of MI6 agents that the agency is trying to retrieve while at the same time M's dubious past is catching up with her in dangerous ways. Bond goes from London to Turkey to Shanghai to Scotland with a fair bit of chases and action on the way. M takes a very prominent role in this one and James Bond's character, including his flaws and background, are explored much more deeply than ever before.But is this what we really want from a James Bond film?The key issue for me as a long time Bond fan is his style, the formula of Bond. Up until Die Another Day (included) the Bond films had a very uniform style of lighthearted escapism with all the little tweaks that make Bond Bond included. However once Daniel Craig took off with Casino Royale (and what continues into Skyfall) is a Jason Bourne/Mission Impossible style relatively generic action-thriller with some Bond elements thrown in. Bond had a formula that worked very well, there was nothing wrong with it. It is supposed to be a little lighthearted, a little shallow, chauvinistic, stylish escapist entertainment. You went to see a Bond film because it was fun, it was so detached from everyday life and every guy wanted to be like Bond. Now however they have gone down the route of making a very ""dark"" Bond film, here a lot of attention is on the characters and their problems and and the plot line which has usually been of Bond trying to save the world in some way is utterly secondary in Skyfall. However I as a true Bond fan want to see him in a plot driven save-the-world type of mission, I am not interested in a dark character drama that is close to being indistinguishable from any generic thriller.That is the biggest flaw of this film: it is ignoring a formula that works so well and instead tries to be something new....but that new is just copying Jason Bourne and other similar films. Skyfall, as it is released 50 years after the first Bond film, is rich in references to the older films which are a delight for a Bond fan to watch out for but they really are more a depressing reminder of ""the good old days"" and stand as a stark contrast to the cold empty shell that Bond has become today. Particularly the female element, such a key aspect of all previous Bond films, is very toned down and it seems that M is more the Bond girl in this film than any other girl.However to finish on a high note, the film had a very nice ending from the standpoint of a Bond fan, a hint of things to come which seem to be going back closer to what Bond used to be and should always be.The film itself isn't bad, its a very interesting thriller. Its only that it isn't very strong as a Bond film but from the way things were heading in Skyfall, it seems that the next Bond film should be a bit closer to what Bond should be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Terrific comeback,"I dunno if you guys get this one but comparing to M:I4 Ghost Protocol this was a masterpiece.Many similarities here and there but still surprisingly good.

It actually worked.Not too much explosions (well there are..) not too much cgi-crap etc. and it got cooler every minute.Really interesting bond for a long time. Actually needs brains a bit to watch this one, if you have seen them all I'll bet you get the idea with this one.This was a comeback, I waited something like explode everything, slow motion effects, stupid sequences but really really inspired with this one.One thing I don't get the hype of this movie, it stands on it's own greatly.For bond fans: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best opening sequence but quickly run out of steam and story,"The 10 minute intro is intense and jaw-dropping and leads to a perfect artistic visual title sequence along the Oscar-winning song from Adele. After leaving Istanbul and Turkey, where the tantalizing ten minutes take place. The first hour is still interesting and have some character development and some great cinematography from Deakins. We meet the new Q in the National Gallery in front of a Turner and the script is still full of humour, we travel to Shanghai and Macau and it is still sexy and suspenseful. We meet the annoying villain played by Javier Bardem and it almost works... yet, when the action comes back to London and later Scotland, it starts to fall apart. The screenplay becomes uninspired and easy and the Skyfall, Scotland buildup and resolution are utterly awful. Barricade, bombs, gunshot and fire in the field yields nothing interesting (save a few nice shots from Deakins) and the Bond backstory is not explored to any usefulness. Javier Bardem cannot do anything with the revengeful plotter who becomes one-dimensional and the sagging story with no plot.I enjoyed every Sam Mendes movie, but here you see the difference in writing quality and consistency. This is no Alan Ball! What could have been the best Bond movie ever (like Bird did with Mission Impossible 4 and Matthew Vaughn did with X-Men:First Class) started with promise, but ended up not quite fulfilling its goal. Hope Mendes will choose better written projects in the future.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A excellent Bond adventure,"I do not normally write reviews but felt compelled to for this movie. The characters and performances are first class. The action scenes are to the high bond standard you would expect but still have that feel that this actually could happen. An adventure story is so much more enjoyable if you can truly immerse yourself in the story and his film although 2.5 hours long holds your attention throughout. I really would recommend it to all even if you are not a Bond fan few would doubt it is a fine adventure / thriller in its own right.I personally thought the Silva was one of the most disturbing but likable of all the Bond Villains. Daniel Craig brilliant and you can see he puts so much into his performances and write deserves praise , I hope he continues with the role for the next 4 or 5 films.I think that as Craig ages he could bring a natural end to the series.

Given this chance, he makes a good Bond.Skyfall combines the elements of the classic Bond films with all the modern ingredients and the film is highly entertaining.

New Age Bond,"Four years on from the disappointing Quantum of Solace, legendary screen hero James Bond (Daniel Craig) makes a triumphant return to the big screen. Director Sam Mendes deserves the lion's share of the credit for this triumph, for his inspiring boldness and deftness in simultaneously paying homage to the classic Bond adventures of the past whilst defying the conventions that have previously made Bond films stale and restricted. Quite frankly, a Bond film that re- establishes several series staples, explores Bond's roots, positions M (Judi Dench) in the main Bond girl role and which features a villain in Silva (Javier Bardem) whose plans are more grounded than simply world domination, deserves huge praise.The film kicks off when a figure from M's past returns to plague her and MI6 comes under attack, a washed up and down on his luck James Bond must return to track down and eliminate the threat at all costs. These events thrust Bond into what can only be described as one of his most thrilling adventures to date, taking the now fifty year old series, in a bold new direction.Perhaps not so coincidentally referring to the 50th anniversary of James Bond and the fact that four years have elapsed since the last Bond film (six since Daniel Craig's debut), the film's central theme revolves around the dichotomy of old and new. Over the course of the film many references are made to this dichotomy jokingly or otherwise. The film examines whether Bond is too old or still has the stuff, whether MI6 and espionage still have a place in the post- Cold War world, how rogue actors present a different threat than traditional nation states and if cyber warfare presents a greater threat than typical military actions in the field among other things. This central dichotomy of old and new is also represented through the characters played by Bond newcomers Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw.The performances from the film's star studded cast are predominantly solid. On his third outing in the main role, Craig finally seems to have grown into Bond's skin and taken full ownership of the character. Judi Dench as always injects M with her trademark cold professionalism while Ralph Fiennes deftly manages to make the audience constantly doubt his character's intentions. However, it is Javier Bardem who is the real star of the film, stealing pretty much every scene he is in. Bardem's villain Silva is the perfect juxtaposition between camp and playful and intimidating and frightening. A particularly memorable scene where he awkwardly caresses an imprisoned Bond more than cements his place in the lore of iconic James Bond villains.However, not all of the performances are on such a high level which tarnishes the film ever so slightly. The two performances in question are those of Berenice Marlohe and Naomie Harris who play the traditional young and beautiful Bond girls of the piece. Now it could be argued that the characters were written poorly or were simply marginalised in favour of making M the main female presence of the film. However, it's hard to ignore the fact that the relatively inexperienced Marlohe switches from seductive and intriguing to unnatural and awkward from scene to scene and that talented actor Harris provides the film's cringe-worthy moments when flirting with Bond. Furthermore, while the film should be praised for its originality in breaking typical Bond tropes and conventions, its central plot is ultimately based on revenge, which is highly unoriginal and overdone at this moment in time.Ultimately, Skyfall is a blockbuster with brains and is a fine example of how a good James Bond film can compete with the absolute heavyweights of the action genre. Right from Adele's iconic opening theme to the closing credits of the film, the audience are taken on a captivating thrill ride. Sam Mendes and the cast deserve massive credit for skilfully crafting one of the very best James Bond films of the series' 50 year run and quite possibly the film of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Low on the Bond scale....,"I came up a rating of 6, mostly because these films are always fun and great looking, regardless of any problems.However, I think this is one of the worst 007 films. Here are a few points:The scenery and cinematography, as always, are terrific. This was probably great on IMAX.I find Daniel Craig to be way too serious and almost constantly pained in some way. Granted, in character and in real life, there were a number of physical setbacks. Past Bonds have always had some degree of humor and fun, but in this film, Craig delivers a few marginally funny lines, not convincingly.So many eye-rolling absurdities exist, most notably the ""Silence of the Lambs"" -ish and the ""Batman Begins""-ish sequences. So many scenarios that are completely unbelievable, regardless of how hard you try to twist them into believability.The justification for the villain's actions are a bit silly, if you ask me. The character doesn't show much range.Overall, it's just not one of the best, not by a long shot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Didn't do it for me,"I feel like a grumpy old man these days, realizing that very few movies ""do it"" for me any more. Skyfall is one of the movies that fail to excite me. While it's certainly competent film-making, it doesn't have that wow-factor and in the end failed to grip my attention properly.The James Bond-franchise has felt a bit tired and outdated for a long time. While I felt that Casino Royale breathed some new life into it, Quantum of Solace was more or less a dud. This movie seems to pick up on the fact that this sort of movie is more or less an anachronism today, and they play a little with that in the story. The truth though is that I'm not sure Bond has a place in today's film. Especially not since much of what made Bond unique is more or less lost, this movie basically plays like a regular action-movie without any of the real characteristics of a Bond-movie. They have even let go of the gadgetry, and while Javier Bardem is certainly a competent actor, I think he makes a somewhat pale villain. While the Bond-franchise is struggling to get up to date, I feel that it's history is weighing it down.Disregarding the Bond-factor this is, like I said in the beginning, competent film-making. It looks good, action-scenes are not bad (although not spectacular either). Daniel Craig is his stone-faced self, and Judy Dench is given a lot of space which is never a bad thing. Of course, as is almost standard fare today, the movie is far too long. 30 minutes could easily be cut out without diminishing the movie.I didn't dislike the movie, it just failed to wow me. I think it has a lot to do with expectations, I want that exciting crazy feeling you got from the older Bond-films where villains where almost magically evil, and they built up entire cities inside mountains with little trains running through them. You just don't get that any more. I miss it, and Bond is a lot less compelling without that magic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"A nice 50th anniversary piece, for the series, and fans will love it!","'SKYFALL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The 50th anniversary of the James Bond series brings us the third appearance of Daniel Craig as Bond in it's twenty-third film. Judi Dench makes her seventh (and final) appearance as M in her biggest turn as the role yet. Javier Bardem also co-stars as the movie's main villain. The film was directed by Sam Mendes (of 'AMERICAN BEAUTY' fame) and written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (who also co-wrote the last four Bond films) as well as John Logan. The story revolves around a computer drive, with a list of British secret agents on it, falling in to the wrong hands. The movie is masterfully directed by Mendes and features more than a handful of spectacular action scenes that Bond films are loved for. One of the better films of the series.The movie opens with Bond and another MI6 agent, named Eve (Naomie Harris), in Turkey in hot pursuit of the mercenary, Patrice (Ola Rapace), who stole the list of undercover NATO agents. Patrice escapes and Bond is believed to be killed. The MI6 commander, M (Dench), is being pressured to retire because of the incident when MI6 is hacked and eight agents are killed. Bond learns of the attack and returns to London, after letting everyone think he was dead for months, and is returned to active duty despite failing his aptitude tests (which M keeps secret, even from Bond). Bond then teams with Eve once again to find out who's responsible for the attack on MI6, as more agents are killed, and tracks the culprit to an island in China.I've always found good Bond films to have great elaborate action scenes but to be light on pacing and excitement in between. This film is actually much faster paced than most others in the series. It's really exciting and involving all the way up to the last 40 minutes when it seems to drag a little and go on for too long. It appears to climax at about an hour and forty minutes but then unexpectedly takes another turn and continues on (somewhat needlessly) for another 40 minutes. The ending is still action packed and somewhat exciting but by the time it gets there it's ran a little low on steam. This is a flaw in my opinion but not a great one. It's still better than most other Bond films and Craig and Dench are outstanding in it once again (Bardem is also an excellent bad guy). The script is routine but a little more emotionally involving than usual, especially involving M's character, and Mendes is perfectly apt at directing a Bond film. It's a nice 50th anniversary piece, for the series, and fans will love it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge23zs5RPrM",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Competently directed but full of plot holes and strange narrative decisions,"After a botched MI6 operation in Istanbul, a lone mercenary, Patrice  (Ola Rapace), escapes with a computer file containing details about  undercover agents working within terrorist organisations. James Bond is  accidentally shot by his partner Eve (Naomie Harris) and believed to be  dead. Back in London, M (Judi Dench) finds her position threatened by  Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), who urges her to retire in the  aftermath of Istanbul. When the MI6 headquarters are bombed following a  threatening cyber-message to M, Bond returns, facing questions about  his mental state and his physical ability. But when Patrice is tracked  down, an assassination leads Bond to a casino in Macao, owned by cyber-  terrorist Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a former colleague of M's.  If I can say off the bat, I've always been in favour of this re-  invention of Bond. As the 'old' Bond films were progressing, they were  becoming gradually more ridiculous and fantasy-laden, leading to the  inexplicable invisible car in Pierce Brosnan's last film as Bond, Die  Another Day (2002). The films seemed to be losing sight of Ian  Fleming's source novels, and although they remained commercial hits,  Brosnan's outings (with the exception of GoldenEye (1995) were becoming  increasingly dire. Casino Royale set the tone early with a moody black-  and-white sequence that gave birth to Daniel Craig's colder, brutal  Bond, less concerned with how his Martini's were made than going to  extreme (and illegal) lengths to bring down his target(s). Royale's  reinvention showed a darker side to the beloved character, yet staying  with tradition, still kept him at an emotional distance.  Director Sam Mendes made the bold decision to reveal more about Bond's  past and childhood, risking fanboy wrath and damaging Bond's almost  mythical characterisations. The main crux of the film focuses on his  relationship with M, a stern authoritarian that risks career and her  own soul in putting national safety and the success of a mission above  the lives of her agents. Bond, being a willing soldier, follows M  blindly, and when Silva announces his intention to enact revenge on M  for a former betrayal, Bond takes M to his childhood home, Skyfall.  Bond facing his childhood allows time to develop on Bond's tormented  psyche, but it all seems quite out of place. One of the most intriguing  things about Bond is his almost suicidal willingness to risk all for  his job due to his almost complete lack of emotion, but Skyfall is  unable to make any grand revelations so it all comes to nothing more  than a distraction. (Saying that, the only previous Bond film to try  and engage Bond emotionally led to one of the most devastatingly cold  climaxes in the series' history in the underrated On Her Majesty's  Secret Service (1969)).  As well as the Bourne series, it seems that Christopher Nolan's Dark  Knight trilogy (2005-2012) is a major influence on this film in  particular. Mendes delves deeper into the workings and hierarchy of  MI6, rather than just a boss sat behind a desk, and adds a modern, more  'real' bad guy in Silva to the mix (even stealing the Joker's voluntary  arrest in The Dark Knight (2008)). Silva is a technical genius, able to  hack MI6's database with relative ease, and also proving himself more  resourceful and intelligent than Bond and M realise. Bardem is  wonderful in the role (as you would expect), but sadly his character is  not. Labelling him simply as a cyber virtuoso seems like a very lazy  way to allow Silva to repeatedly outwit MI6 and their own technical  marvel Q (Ben Whishaw) to the point where you wonder if Britain's  finest could really be so stupid. The film is therefore full of  plot-holes and distracting MacGuffin's that stretches out the running  time to more than it really needs to be.  Skyfall also asks a lot of the audience, especially when it comes to  suspending their belief. Before the frankly bizarre opening sequence  appears and we are treated to Adele's drab title song, we witness an  already wounded Bond get shot with a rifle and fall over 300 feet from  the Varda Viaduct into water, only to emerge alive and romancing a  mystery woman. No explanation is given as to how he manages to survive  the ordeal, and given the revelations about Bond's diminishing physical  prowess, it seems rather insulting. As questions are raised by his  superiors over Bond's ability to his job given his age (it must be the  grey in his stubble), Bond is put through various tests in which he  struggles with, yet half way through the film, this seems to be simply  put aside as he competently shoots and fights his way through various  bad guys. Again, no real explanation given.  Like I stated before, the most suitable word to describe this film  would be underwhelming, especially with the critical adoration that the  film was lavished with. The action scenes are dull, with nothing  matching the free-jumping opening of Royale. They are also quite  strange - was anyone expecting a henchman to be eaten by a CGI Komodo  dragon? How about death by underwater funky chicken? It all leads to a  very unsatisfying climax at Skyfall, where a simple shoot-out and foot  chase fail to justify a 2 hour-plus build-up. It feels like the entire  film is building up to an explosive climax that never comes. I found  the whole experiencing really quite baffling, with the attempts to mix  the old with the new Bond never really convincing or flowing. The film  is competently directed by Mendes however, and everything looks  suitably crisp and clean. What direction all of this means for Bond, I  don't know, but given the film is currently the 14th highest-grossing  film of all time, and the film somehow being lauded by critics and  audiences alike, it won't be too long until Craig dons the suit once  again.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Resurrection at its finest.,"Going into this film (and it truly is a film, that's how beautiful it is), I had heard all the hype from overseas, and so I was expecting it to be good, but not this good. I was worrying that it was going to be too action-heavy, but its not: it takes the time to establish relationships between the characters, so when there is action, it actually matters. I'm really not qualified to say if this is the best Bond film, or even if Daniel Craig is the best Bond, but I can say that this is by far the best of the one's Craig has worked on, and I also believe Craig is incredibly believable as Bond--he's a person, with actual emotions and feelings, rather than just a spy.Now even though I gave this film a perfect rating, it is not perfect--it's absolutely fantastic, but of course a few things could've been better. However, because of the way this film ends, I could not rate it anything but a ten. The ending is absolutely mind-blowing. To say much about it would be to give away the entire film, but I will say this: they have changed the future of the series forever (and by series, I mean the ones staring Craig).Speaking of Daniel Craig, I have to praise him even further. He really is an amazing actor, and brings so much to this role. I think this is one of his best performances--he might've even been better here than in last year's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, although that's a close call. Like I said earlier, though, his Bond is the most grounded--he's still a tough, cunning spy, but here he manages to appear more vulnerable. Other actors did a great job as well: Javier Bardem is terrifyingly sly as Silva, Naomie Harris does a good job as the rookie field agent, and Bérénice Marlohe has a short but memorable role as the complicated Sévérine. Additionally, the dynamic between Ralph Fiennes and Daniel Craig is fantastic, as well as the dynamic between him and Ben Winshaw's ingenious Q.The true performance, however, comes from none other than Judi Dench. This is by far her biggest role as M, as well as her most impressive performance in along time. In my opinion, her character's storyline makes the film. The emotion she was able to bring to her character while still staying stern in the presence of others is absolutely breathtaking, especially in the courtroom scene and the incredibly emotional ending.The locations, too, helped make this an amazing film. From the chase scene in Istanbul-- which was one of the best I've seen in a while--to the towering heights of Shanghai; from the reinvented MI6 in London to the beautiful moors of Scotland, the sights are impressive throughout. Equally as impressive is Roger Deakins' cinematography, which was truly stunning and made the film all the more beautiful.Skyfall truly is one of the year's best films. It may lag a little bit in the middle, but that's only a minor fault as it hurdles towards the climactic ending. One of the best parts for me, actually, was finding out the meaning behind the title, and, however subtle it was, it was a great moment and perfectly integrated into the plot line.This is now a different Bond. I'm sure the writers realized what they were doing when the made one of the major themes resurrection, as after the alright-but-disappointing Quantum of Solace, Bond needed to be reinvented--again. They have made some sacrifices, but ultimately succeeded. This Bond is modern, but true to how the books make him appear. There are also some great references to older gadgets, like the exploding pen and ejector seat, although they don't necessarily feature in the film. Bond nowadays is more about ingenuity rather than gadgets, and he is all the more realistic and impressive for it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"""A Cinematic Masterclass in Bond's Rebirth""","Skyfall isn't just a movie; it's an adrenaline-fueled symphony of style, substance, and sheer badassery that redefines what a James Bond film can be. From the moment the iconic gun barrel sequence transitions into a haunting orchestral score, you're not just a spectator-you're enthralled, immersed in a world where danger and elegance collide.Set against a backdrop of breathtaking cinematography and a storyline that intertwines Bond's personal demons with the inexorable march of technology and betrayal, Skyfall delivers a narrative that is as rich as it is thrilling. The film reintroduces Bond to a new generation while paying homage to the franchise's storied past. Here, technology is both a tool and a weapon, with the stakes not just high, but profoundly personal. The mission to protect MI6 becomes a visceral journey into the heart of what it means to be Bond.Daniel Craig embodies 007 with a gritty intensity that breathes new life into the character. This time, he's not just a suave secret agent; he's a vulnerable hero confronting his own mortality, pushed to his limits by the merciless Javier Bardem as Silva, a villain that is as charismatic as he is chilling. Silva is a game-changer in every sense, with motivations that resonate deeply, making him one of the most memorable antagonists in the franchise. Their cat-and-mouse dynamic crackles with tension and psychological depth, challenging Bond as never before.The film's pacing is a rollercoaster ride-a high-octane chase through the streets of Istanbul, contrasted with serene yet haunting sequences at Bond's ancestral home, Skyfall. Each location feels meticulously crafted, from the neon-lit streets of Shanghai to the desolate beauty of the Scottish Highlands. And just when you think you've seen it all, the film delivers a bombastic climax that echoes the themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and redemption, leaving you breathless.Skyfall also triumphs in its supporting cast. Judi Dench delivers a career-defining performance as M, embodying the fierce, maternal figure that Bond needs while underlining the complexities of their relationship. The ensemble, including the brilliant Ralph Fiennes as Mallory and the effortlessly charming Naomie Harris as Eve Moneypenny, adds layers of intrigue and sharp dialogue that elevate the narrative.And let's not forget about the music-Adele's haunting theme song is nothing short of iconic, setting the tone perfectly and resonating deep within your core. It's the cherry on top of a cinematic feast that combines the gritty realism of the Craig era with nods to the classic Bond flair.Overall, Skyfall is a tour de force that stands as one of the greatest entries in the James Bond saga. It's more than just action; it's art, beautifully crafted and expertly executed. It delves into the psyche of an icon, reminding us that even legends have moments of vulnerability. If you're looking for a film that's as badass as it is beautifully made, look no further. Skyfall is here to remind us that 007 is still very much alive, evolving, and ready to take on whatever comes next.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"Not just the best Craig Bond film, this is the best Bond film ever. Period.","This is truly the pinnacle of Bond films. Although perhaps not the best opening action sequence overall, it succeeds in introducing the tone of the film-- one that fits perfectly with the narrative. It also introduces Naomie Harris who is a welcome addition to this revamped cast. And maybe the animation sequence doesn't tell the best story, but it's so clever, and when matched with Adele's titular song, it is definitely the best theme.Early on Daniel Craig briefly sports a scruffy look. He doesn't come close to passing the physical. The psychological examination is clever. All of this and more builds on the approach Sam Mendes beautifully takes this film. And it's all backed behind a stellar cast. Ben Whishaw plays one of my favorite (if not favorite actually) characters in the young and arrogant techno Q, and of course adding Ralph Fiennes into the mix is awesome. This also marks the best narrative given to Judi Dench as the aging M (although give Judi Dench credit because she looks great for however many decades old she is).If you didn't know it was coming, I had to save Javier Bardem for last. He is a powerhouse actor who became familiar to American audiences with his villainous turn in No Country for Old Men (I'd describe his character as the combination of Joker and Two Face from The Dark Knight). Also shout out to his starring role in Alejandro Inarritu's foreign film Biutiful. And if you need any more evidence of his quality acting, look no further than his malignant and sophisticated role in this film. His introduction and monologue is memorable, his actions are remorseless, and unlike Christoph Waltz's antagonist in the sequel, the execution of his plan is smart and scary. Easily the best villain of this series.Something I haven't really discussed much from the other films but that is so vital to the success of this film is the cinematography. The film lost out to Life of Pi at the Oscars, but the shots of Shanghai-- in particular the silent action scene in the skyscraper is one of my favorites of any film-- are such a gorgeous combination of colors bursting from the dark surroundings (hmm, even a bit like the tone of the film).This movie is the perfect blend of old and new Bond. Throw on top a great character-driven story, and not only is this my favorite film of Daniel Craig's series, it's my favorite Bond film (admittedly, I need to re-watch many of the classics, especially with Sean Connery). And not only is it my favorite Bond film, it's just a tremendous film on its own. Multiple scenes always pop out as memorable, and the climax is simply fantastic. Even if you haven't seen Casino Royale, or any Bond film for that matter, I can't stress enough that to anybody and everybody I give a high recommendation to go watch Skyfall.

"An impressive production of same-as, same-as","It must have taken an enormous effort to film the chases, the shoot- outs, especially that first one in Turkey (according to the DVD).But the overall story, although very dramatic and full of ACTION is really so ordinary, just like dozens of other films, (ie, Cruise's) and so many others that I've seen recently. ie, initial set-up of ""the problem"", followed by numerous chase scenes, and eventually, a great big shooting spree. It gets predictable, inevitable, and rather boring.The best bits (for me), the fancy computer graphics used to trace Bond through London and elsewhere, and I'm curious to know just where that great big bridge at the start is?Judy Dench is great of course, and there is a brief appearance of Albert Finney (Masroy in Erin Brockovich), hard to even recognise.Now I'm tempted to actually read a real Fleming ""Bond"" story, just to see if he puts all that shooting in?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Don't be so anal!,"All you guys giving negative reviews, you have no business watching Bond films. You need to watch JFK, or Platoon, or Saving Private Ryan, or some other reality based film. Bond is a FICTIONAL character, who lives in a FICTIONAL universe that uses real life SETTINGS. The movies are about a FANTASY SUPER SPY. Let me say that again. F-A-N-T-A-S-Y S-U-P-E-R S-P-Y. He's supposed to supersede logical expectations. The things you don't see depicted on screen are supposed to be left to your imagination. I LOVED the movie. I am a true Bond fan. I've seen EVERY movie a MINIMUM 3 times. The way they tied SF to classic Bond was perfect. If anything, the first two movies weren't true Bond films. They were character driven action films whose main players just happened to be based on Bond movies. This, however, is a real Bond movie, with a 2012 edge. Again, I LOVED it. You guys need to stop being so anal and just enjoy it for what it is. I mean, we know the Avengers are not real, but we enjoyed the movie just the same.....",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"There are positives here, even if James Bond himself is not one of them","Skyfall opens with a vehicle chase of classic Bond pedigree, and then slides elegantly to the opening titles via a clever dramatic twist. With the ever ambitious Sam Mendes in the director's chair, this opening bears promise that this could be the film where the stark and realistic Bond we've seen so far in the Daniel Craig era obtains some of the playful creativity of previous eras. And the film certainly knows its place in and obligations to the history of this longest-running film series ever, as it continues in its discussion of renewal vs preservation and progressive vs conservative values: The possibly outdated MI6 finds itself under attack from hacker terrorists, good old gadget Q is replaced by a computer whiz kid, and M starts pondering whether she's too old.Up steps a somewhat dejected 007, appearing as something of the antithesis of technology and modernism, demonstrating to us all that it still is bravery and old-fashioned killer instincts which do the trick. He invites us along to a couple of captivating set-pieces, but also back to his childhood and some weary-looking inner demons. And while some viewers may think this makes him deeper or more human, I find it only makes him less enigmatic and fascinating. The effortlessly invincible Bond was more interesting than another semi-depressed freedom-fighter. James Bond doesn't need a psychological profile. He's supposed to give us hope and faith in a cruel world, not equate himself with said cruelty.There are positives here though, even if James Bond himself is not one of them. In my review of Quantum of Solace, I claimed that the Bond films often were only as good as their villain, and in Javier Bardem's wildly vindictive and somewhat pansy Raoul, Skyfall has lots of material to play off of. He's not always employed to the best purpose, but his presence gives the film edge. He's fun and over the top, without coming off as the typical two-dimensional Bond villain.Three films into Daniel Craig's reign as 007 we're seeing a film series with a need to go someplace new, but that cannot quite make up its mind which direction this should be. Skyfall is progressive and reactionary at the same time, and while there are a number of interesting discussions and aspects to this, the film doesn't feel sufficiently full-blooded and confident to establish itself as a step in the right direction, or even a successful spy/action movie anno 2012.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
New Classy Bond,"Daniel Craig's version of James Bond is probably the most engaging one so far. Casino Royale improves the series with grittier and much serious tone. Though, Quantum of Solace is simply just a straightforward action film. Skyfall brings back the spy's classiness and simply tells a compelling story. While the action scenes are magnificent and the filmmaking is fancy. There's also a fascinating performance by Javier Bardem. Skyfall is definitely one of the best Bond films ever.Skyfall is kind of extraordinary as a Bond film. Classic Bond elements are there but the film tries to go deeper and have more dangerous conflicts. It can be a little bit tamed sometimes but it's best when it explores more about the villain and the threats for M. The film tells the story in a slicker way like how the characters are introduced and the action scenes are executed. The actions scenes are exciting enough. After the gruff high octane opening chase, the rest of the action is all hiding in the shadows and blowing up stuff. There isn't much of a romance, but it's not really necessary for this story.Daniel Craig is still pretty awesome as Bond and Judi Dench is always great as M. Ben Whishaw gives a nice introduction to the new Q and Noamie Harris is pretty likable as her role. But obviously, Javier Bardem is the standout of the film. He brings a lot of threat and strangeness to the villain. There's also a bit of sympathy beneath the character that he made effective enough.The most impressive in the filmmaking is the cinematography that classes up every shot of the film. It also has a fabulous production design. There's almost nothing to mention about the special effects until you see the obviously CGI'd lizard. The original Bond theme plays often in parts and the Skyfall song fits well to the film.Skyfall is a strong Bond film. It tells the story cleverly and adds more depth to the Bond character with elegant filmmaking and brisk, surreal action sequences. It's overall innovative to the series. It has the classy Bond swagger but aims higher with more compelling drama and exciting thrills. Some might get disappointed for not having enough Bond Girl moments but I think we can live without it for a while. In the end, it's an amazing experience that is stirring and brilliantly done.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Excellent, with one notable flaw","*Spoiler Alert*As most people, I'm a huge fan of the James Bond character. My favourite actor to portray the coolest agent in the world has always been Connery, but I must say, I'm really warming to Craig. Despite missing some of his original characteristics, I think that the character is still fascinating, perhaps especially because of its development in a new and quite interesting direction; coolness, charm, elegance and, let's face it, a lack of any real depth has been replaced with an icy, stubborn, dependent and 'rebel'-like surface to cover up for the tragically lonely and distrusting core, that has come to be Bond, since Craig's debut in Casino Royale. This movie gives further insight to the Bond of the 21. century; and even when it gets maybe a little too sentimental (like the battle in his childhood home, before it is blown up), I think it works mainly because Craig is not the sentimental type; he is a dislikable version of a cross between John McClane and Jason Bourne on the outside, and only on the inside a kind of 'tortured soul'. So definitely, Daniel Craig's character and performance is a big part of this movie's excellence. Another big part is Javier Bardem's portrayal of the betrayed MI6 agent. If it is not actually the reason, why this movie is so totally worth seeing. This is indeed af type of villain not seen before in the 'James Bond Genre'; sure we saw Sean Bean as Alec, the former agent who went 'bad' in GoldenEye, but as Bond evolves with Craig, so does the concept of the Evil he fights. Silva (Bardem) is actually in many ways a typical villain of our time; of course he does his evil deeds with the help of computers, and homosexuality is now rightly accepted even in the Bond-universe. But the new aspect of the villain is Silva's humanity: He might be in some ways typically mentally unstable, but he is also just angry - and perhaps rightfully it seems. He is lonely, sexual, passionate. And actually also loving it seems, in his last scene, where he seems to truly be concerned with M's ('mom's) condition. The only thing actually wrong with him seems to be his overpowering feeling of being betrayed - which has then led him to become what we would call a 'psycho'. Alas, the defining character must be intelligence, which is indeed characteristic for the last ten to fifteen years' movies' portrayal of evil people. Along with Kevin Spacey as John Doe in 7 and of course Heath Ledger as The Joker in The Dark Knight, Bardem just went right to the top of my 'Coolest Bad Guys of All Time' list. Bardem is as always convincing, and really nails the psychopathic but at the same time sad avenger. The whole theme of 'M's past' is interesting. For the first time, it's not decided for us, that she is good; even she has a past - she has sins, even if her deeds were for the sake of her career and her country. The direct M-Villain relationship is definitely an exciting initiative. Of course a number of flaws can be found in any movie, but the only one really worth mentioning here is the character of 'the New Q'. I actually get the notion that since Bond is middle-aged, it would create humorous tensions if 'a guy who still has spots' gets to boss him around. And strictly talking appearance, Ben Whishaw is an excellent choice; skinny, pale, 'nerdy' - but in that kinda-cute-and-kinda-fashionable way that has been so popular lately in the portrayal of 'The Nerd' (think Seth Cohen i Orange County). The major problem is that he is not efficient. Bond cracks the code - he doesn't, his computersystem - the supposedly best protected security system in the UK is hacked by one IMPRISONED man, and - he seems more confused, than intelligent. What's with the subway scene - 'I see you Bond' - okay, but are you actually contributing with anything? The old Q (before John Cleese) was dominant, authoritative, self-assured, and a genius (which gave him the right to the first three characteristics) - Ben Whishaw's performance unfortunately doesn't let us believe that the new Q has the potential to become any of these things. One last minor detail: Very nice touch, that Naomi Harris turned out to be Moneypenny - she has actually always been one of my favourite characters, and one that I've kind of missed in the last couple of films.All in all: Beautifully filmed, stunning action movie - and a James Bond movie with more layers than usually. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the best of Bond in last 10 years,"Craig Daniel has dropped the larger than life image of Bond. This is amply clear in this movie at least. Gadgetry used is also not making him a superhuman.

And the good part is - suddenly Bond does not become a network's wizard. there's another guy to help him out here. I am expecting the next Bond-movie to have more on this stuff.

Bond continues to be the world's hero of entertainment,"James Bond has always been my favorite action hero. I have read most of the books and seen all of the movies. While the '06 release of ""Casino Royale"" revived Bond and ""Quantum of Solace"" proved a mediocre sequel, ""Skyfall"" gives Agent 007 a new clean slate. It holds a story of its own, pays homage to other Bond flicks, and introduces characters that all of us Bond fans have come to love over the past years.Daniel Craig is back as Bond and once again, he embodies the soul of the man. He kicks ass, does the impossible, and even steals the hearts of some hot babes. Pure Bond. Judi Dench is perfect as usual as M. Ralph Fiennes, Naomi Harris, and Albert Finney give decent performances in their respective roles. Finney is particularly amusing. But in any James Bond film, the antagonist is what helps make the movie really memorable. Javier Bardem proves a true genius as ""Skyfall's"" villain. He plays a good psychopath (without relying on any reference to No Country for Old Men), and adds strong levels of flamboyance, wicked humor, and even devastating emotion.It may seem a bit odd that Sam Mendes, a master of dramatic films like ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"" would direct a Bond. Even so, Mendes does a stand up job of combining both character drama and stunning action sequences. In addition, his technical team helps him craft such a success. Thomas Newman delivers a lush score and Roger Deakins beautifully photographs each scene with care and precision. The only downer about this Bond is the overabundance of CGI. While some effects were photo realistic, others were blatantly awful. Agent 007 has entertained us as the world's greatest secret agent. And he has done so for 50 years. No other franchise has achieved such an accomplishment. Of 23 movies, ""Skyfall"" is one of the best. Let us hope that he continues to be our hero with installments of Bond 24 and 25.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the Worst Bonds Ever!,"Being a huge Bond fan, particularly the last two films, and reading the never ending good reviews I was expecting something epic.Maybe this high bench mark has somewhat biased my opinion but instead of the best bond film ever, I found Skyfall to be one of the worst.Basically it's boring, there's nothing new, and seems to be a swan song for Bond rather than a celebration of all that makes it great!It starts out good, then suddenly becomes the slowest paced Bond film, and nothing but a rehash of old story lines. Once again an old MI6 agent has gone rogue. Once again someone has a personal vendetta against M and wants to kill her for a judgment call she made in the past.One good thing about the film is, besides a stop in China for a stylish Kill Bill style assassination, it takes place in the UK.Javier Bardem is the best thing in the film but I think he's on screen maybe 15 minutes.It starts out being about a missing list of agents, a la Mission Impossible, but the plot loses it's way and becomes an very overly complicated revenge plan to kill M and equally overly complicated and stupid plan to evade it.I think what disappointed me the most was the constant references to how old and useless Bond has become. He's off work for 3 months and comes back suddenly as a 70 year old that can't shoot. MI6 is constantly said to be old and unneeded, isn't this in the same world with constant media hysteria about the threat of terrorists and need to more and more national security? Isn't there two more Daniel Craig Bond films after this, as it seemed like a curtain call film more than anything else.The baddie we are told is a psycho, extremely dangerous and most importantly a master with technology. But Technology is hardly used at all and not really featured. There was a lot more in the last film or the ones with Pierce Brosnan.Finally the big twist (don't worry I won't reveal it) is really obvious.

Probably the best and the most offbeat of them all.,"I won't add much more to what it has already been told about this film. I consider it as one of the best of the whole series. At least the one which brings the more new blood to the rest of it. Even if this means to get out of the franchise. In other words, this movie doesn't look like a James Bond feature. Especially in the end. The only link between the last part and the JB franchise is the Aston Martin...Anyway, I highly prefer this one to the SPECTRE movie, which is more a classical JB film. But I also understand that many JB fans may be disappointed by this one. I respect this. Judy Dench is here at her best. yes, this is a JB film that doesn't look like the others. That's why I love it.But don't worry, that's not an intellectual movie at all.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the best Bond films ever.,"This movie was absolutely fantastic. Daniel Craig once again shows why he's the best James Bond ever. He's has all of the charisma of any of the past Bonds but has a grit to him that allows the movies to be a bit darker and more realistic. While I didn't enjoy Skyfall quite as much as Casino Royale, it was still much better than Quantum of Solace and is probably my second favorite Bond movie ever. I liked that they added depth to M and touched on some of the political element to MI6. I was a bit disappointed that Berenice Marlohe wasn't featured more. I've been hearing for the past month what a beautiful and fantastic Bond-girl she is and, while she is stunning, she was barely in the film at all. Overall, it's a great movie and more than just Bond fans will enjoy it.

A skin tight suit will never stop this 007 from killing with his bare hands. The nation's favourite sign is reborn.,"From a parachute assignment with her majesty the Queen over Danny Boyle's inspiring set at the opening ceremony of London 2012 to the misty depth's of the Scottish highlands, Mr Bond faces his most injurious test by having to decide between the two most significant women in his life, thus providing us with a glimpse of who the true Bond girl is.The consensus of Skyfall's Bond has seen 007's maturities establish with a distinctive rawness. We now have a rigid skinned agent whose experiences have seen sorrow and anguish in his past but seen a persona who has benefited from the audience's acceptance of the solemn tenor and less extravagant gadget themes throughout the franchise's fifty year stint. Daniel Craig has provided a new dimension to Bond, predominantly fitting within the criteria of the modern shift of seriousness within film. His wonderful talents pursue the conventional raw emotions that Bond feels in this outing. He crucially understands the material from 007's past and motions of the present determine the character's motivation. The 23rd instalment brings the modern Bond to his most atmospheric challenge yet. Skyfall sees Craig embark on one of icon's most testing missions. His loyalty to M (Judi Dench) is placed under detrimental restraint. Not only does he have to scuffle with a silky but uncomfortable nemesis in former MI6 employee Silva (Javier Bardem), Craig is set the challenge of performing even more charismatically on the eve of Bond's fiftieth anniversary, turning a domestic threat into a personal one.This episode breathes an air of familiarity as we are invited into the notion of a qualified agent, suffering from an ageing atonement with an element of vulnerability and victimisation but his wise and highly articulate prowess in his field play dividend, sticking to his prehistoric loyalty to MI6. The mortal human factor is a blessing to see and but Craig's posture on screen counters this with beautiful arrogance and the mental determination of Bond. A titanic sum of thought has gone into this outing. The franchise seemed to be in a perilous state and needed to be reborn.We are led to believe the perilous trip that Bond has journeyed since the days of Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan has led to this very moment. We develop a perceptive of Bond's continuation away from subsistence of spy life, learning of his life without parents and being invited into his personal routes before M's motherhood role took shape. This series seems to build relationships between each of the films since Casino Royale. On screen growth between Craig and Dench would propose a step-parent affiliation. Certain tags are given through the dialogue and symbolism in character gesture and movement. Besides M, Craig develops a healthy relationship with the very woman who places a rifle bullet through his canvas which rather convincingly reminds us of the characteristics between Bond and Miss Moneypenny.Beyond the tone of severity we are taken on a voyage to relive some wonderful tones and mimics that remind us of the majestic overtones over the last fifty years, particularly in the Brosnan era. Preambles such as an academic censored handgun are imputed whilst annotations on exploding ballpoints are snorted at, in particular by the striking, and resourceful Q (Ben Whishaw). The selection of artiste for Q is rather smart, using a moderately nameless and inexpert big screen actor to play an archaic character, following the footsteps of John Cleese, Whishaw adds much sophistication to the role.Sam Mendes' first attempt at a Bond is undeniably an endeavour he can be proud of. He has deliberated the story with a glorious attitude and tendency, blessing us with some gripping contrasts in China to elevate the superiority in design and technology, and then stripping back the intensity with raw sentiments across the landscape views throughout the Scottish highlands and the country's vast dissimilarities in culture from London. The sombre graphic of the narrative offers complexity and heavy watching is sometimes required but this is not too punishing on its audience after Mendes hurls Bond into a moving train cart and then allows him to briefly pause to adjust his shirt cuff, a gesture that relieves impetus in the scene without entirely concluding the anxiety. Aside from the rich style and glamour of China and London, 007 gets gritty in the swarming markets of Turkey, a replicate of his past lethally reminding us of From Russia With Love. Globe hiking has forever been as crucial to the franchise as the harmonious gadgets, with an elegant ray of the map across all of its geographical coordinates, sizable body counts, sports cars and crafty arsenal are expected within the genre, there have been a few blunders down the years and a couple of forgotten suit bearers. Mendes and Craig work magnificently in creating the epic that Bond enthusiasts have been longing for.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Skyfall-high on drama and closer to some realistic stuff,"Celebrating 50 years of bond history and 23rd film in the successful bond series ""Skyfall"" opens up with a good action sequence as usual franchise of bond movies followed up by an average title score. Basic plot of the movie isn't tough bond has show his loyalty towards his boss ""M"" as she gets into a trouble this time. The film isn't just about Bond it's about M and her journey over the years as the head. The movie emphasises on is M's relationship with bond. Coming to the casting Daniel has done a good performance but sometimes he is more like Bourne rather bond type. Judi as ""M"" has done a great job on her role as usual to say the she is the women lead with a meaty role. The bond girls didn't much screen space allocated. The villain this time Javier Bardem as a crazy, lunatic, venomous Silva has done a brilliant job. But his makeover was menacing with a blonde hair. We could say he was like The Dark knight heath ledger type of villain. ""Q"" by Ben whishaw (Perfume movie hero) looks apt in the role. The director Sam Mendes gives more importance to the script, dialogues where this movie being the most emotional Bond movie yet like bond revisiting his home and M's farewell. This movie has got standard ingredients like oriental music, very few gadgets, backless gowns, attracting villain girlfriend, tricky action sequences but as a limited version where story sentiments and dialogues takes over much. But comparing to the last flick Quantum of Solace this is definitely a better one. Verdict: Low on gadgets, high on drama and closer to some realistic stuff. Dramatic first half and a speedy second half.Bottom line: For those die-hard bond fans whose expectations are more fun, charm, beautiful girls, big sets and more signature tunes of 007 certainly you will feel this is not enough.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
go.od and not so,"The problem with Bond films is the insistence on the same or similar formula. This tends to rule out or at least inhibit the development of a good storyline. Having read all Ian Flemings books, I wish just one would start in his apartment, early morning, does his press ups, prepares his scrambled eggs etc, instead of always a precipitous action start. Having said that Skyfall must be one of the best beginnings to any Bond film. The first twenty minutes was spectacular and beautifully filmed. When the adverts came on I just said, ""follow that"". This is where it fell down ,it couldn't. The story reverted to the usual formulaic pattern, and the script was frankly sub standard. I know the one liners are usually quite corny, but at least they are funny, though nearly absent in this film. After all this criticism I must add the acting was excellent,and the song and singing from Adele brilliant. So my thoughts are, better story, sharper more sophisticated script, and save some from the first 20 minutes for the rest of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Back to fantastic!,"After the previous poor effort, i had such low expectations of 'Skyfall' but the third Craig Bond, really delivers and is easily as good if not superior to 'Casino Royale'. In fact the only aspect of a classic Bond caper missing, is the mind-blowing musical score by John Barry; otherwise it's a full-blown, exciting action yarn. There are so many nice touches in 'skyfall' and Daniel.C, has really cemented in confidence with the character, although interestingly being at his most vulnerable. The William Tell scene is such a stand alone classy scene. Another feather in the cap is a masterly, sinister performance from the Spaniard, Javier Bardem and whoever comes next as the Bond bad guy, will be hard pushed to top this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"If you love lots of stunts and action, you'll like this one.","""Skyfall"" is a good film and it made a buttload of money. Whether or not you love it will depend on how much you love stunts, explosions and chases. If you adore them and can't get enough of them, then this film is for you! It's more like ""Die Hard"" in many ways than a traditional James Bond film. As for me, I don't particularly love stunts and really like more plot and dialog--so it wasn't a film that I fell in love with...but it wasn't boring.I could review the plot or talk at length about this film, but really don't feel a need. At this point, there are over 1200 reviews for the movie!! But I will mention one problem I found with the film--dumb lapses. In other words, instead of working out logical errors (such as how the MI-6 computer system was so easily compromised as well as why Bond ALONE took on the baddies at the end with no help whatsoever from the British military--even though this took place in Scotland!) the film was too concerned with explosions. As for me, it's a decent film but nothing more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Shaken AND Stirred,"Skyfall is not a return to ""classic Bond""; it is rather a completely unique hybrid of elements from the earlier films and the darker tone and character of Fleming's later novels (which have been hinted at, but never fully explored before now). Thematically, the film is a Freudian examination of two orphaned sons and the cold, manipulative and abandoning surrogate mother they share. Bond's trademark self-confidence is shattered by a monumental betrayal by M., who seems to have lost her moral compass. And Bardem's Silva offers a manic and terrifying glimpse of what Bond may well become if he continues on his self-destructive path.It is strange and disturbing to see Bond as anything less than the tuxedoed superhero that drew me to the cinema religiously every other year for decades. I don't consider Skyfall the best Bond film by any stretch (for me, that would be Goldfinger, followed by OHMSS and Casino Royale), but it is certainly the most disturbing and thought-provoking. I respect it for those reasons. I also pray the folks at Eon don't try it again for a very long time. There's a place yet in the world for the glorious popcorn days of exploding pens and space stations.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Old Ways are Indeed the Best,"After a long four year wait for the next 007 film to come out due to MGM's financial issues, SKYFALL finally hit cinemas and it was more than worth the wait. It's obvious that the crew behind the movie took a lot of time and effort perfecting what could be considered as the best Bond movie in years. What unfolded before my eyes wasn't just a movie but an experience.What made SKYFALL great was that it took everything that makes a James Bond movie great (exotic locations, action, a threatening villain, etc.) and improves every single one of them while at the same time adding new ones. SKYFALL finally returns the franchise back to its roots so no longer do we have the boredom and excessive BOURNE influence seen in the previous two installments; this is a James Bond film just like the old days where entertainment and story are balanced. The movie also serves as a love letter to the fans with the numerous references to the old Bond movies and its old-school style; anyone who's seen Bond since the start will love SKYFALL, all the way from the nostalgic theme song opening to the climatic confrontation at the end.The cast fit their roles perfectly and redefined established characters in the Bond mythology. I have no doubt that Daniel Craig can be a great James Bond but it was only now that he was given a good James Bond script to work with; Bond is still the playboy and efficient MI6 agent but now, he's also a human being. The same goes for the rest of the cast; one of the new things added into the film which was rarely seen in previous Bond films was the complexity of the characters. They're still the usual mainstays of a Bond film (a terrorist mastermind, M, a bureaucrat, the Bond girl, etc.) but now they're all human beings with motivations that drive their actions. They don't rely anymore on simple politics but now they rely on personal issues to drive them. This addition only made the drama of SKYFALL more engaging and believable.Another addition that I appreciated was the overlying theme of the secret service's relevance in the changing times. Such themes were mentioned off-hand and never fully explored in the Brosnan movies (especially GOLDENEYE) so now that it gets full focus, it helps the movie become more relevant in our time period. The problem with reviving old franchises is the task of making the aged characters work in a time period different from the one they were originally envisioned in; in the case of Bond, he was born in the golden age of espionage of the Cold War but now, in an age that relies more on a computer for intelligence information, those like him have close to no purpose at all. SKYFALL successfully overcomes the problem in a masterful way with its impressive dialogue between the old guard of espionage and the modern age believers. The dialogue between the characters is powerful enough to make even a James Bond fan (like myself) question the franchise's relevance now that the Cold War and the need for spies is long over; what makes the script great is not only in how it will get you involved in the story and its characters but it will definitely make you think and reflect a lot many other things.My only complaint with SKYFALL was the CGI. The green-screen effects of some scenes were pretty obvious and while it doesn't dent the movie at all, it was a bit distracting and annoying to look at. Hopefully, in the next bond movies, the crew ditches or at least improves the CGI to make things look more realistic. I personally hope they go back to practical effects but that may just be me.SKYFALL is the best thing that happened to James Bond in the new millennium. By far, this is the most emotional and exciting James Bond in recent memory and none of the drama in the storyline felt forced as everything worked well in the film's context as it did in CASINO ROYALE. Those who are worried that SKYFALL is only a James Bond movie in name will have no reason to fear. SKYFALL is an old-school Bond movie with all the improvements and additions the 2000's could provide and it works well, molding SKYFALL into a masterpiece in the long history of the James Bond franchise. It just goes to show that, indeed, (quoting Kincade in the movie) ""Sometimes the old ways are the best.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Daneil craig is james bond!,I watched Skyfall and I felt that like the other bond movies it lacked action I mean the action sequences were not enough to entertain the viewer the action scenes were very low and the more and more concentration is given to the bond style suits and all.I think that the film was not up to the mark as it was reported around 200 million budget you can take the other movies which are as of same budget but they lacks action sequences.I cannot understand how a big budget Hollywood movie can lack action sequences? I think they like to spend on promotion rather than on film.But despite of all this I like this movie I am a fan of Daniel Craig and I liked his casino royale very much but the Daniel Craig has somewhat balanced this movie he was stylish doing action very well and all.I liked this movie but hope that if any new bond movie comes it must have more action sequences.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Best of Bond!,"""Skyfall"" is unlike any James Bond movie you've seen before. While the film pays homage to the previous installments, first-time Bond director Sam Mendes reinvents the superspy's story, taking him into far darker territory. The result? Arguably the most well-crafted and thrilling film in the franchise's 50 years.This time around, Bond -- who has been publicly pronounced dead but remains in hiding after a botched mission -- is brought back to ""life"" to recover a hard drive from a cyber terrorist named Silva (Javier Bardem). While his mission seems simple, loyalties are questioned between Bond (Daniel Craig) and his superior M (Dame Judi Dench), for she might be responsible for the previous near-fatal mission. And while M is hiding secrets of her own, she's also the target of Silva, who will stop at nothing to bring her and MI6 to their demise.When ""Casino Royale"" was released, Craig immediately jumped to top of everyone's favorite Bond actor list for his grounded, man's man portrayal. He's got the chops with his physicality, sexual machismo, and cool demeanor. So what's left to develop? ""Skyfall"" presents Bond as an aging and wounded soldier, who doesn't blame the organization for his pain but rather accepts it as part of the job. Revealed to be an orphan, Bond seemingly continues to function as if MI6 is his family and M as his mother.Dench paves the way as the true Bond girl of the film. Strong-willed and determined to get the job done, M's quip-filled scenes with Bond explore their professional yet symbiotic relationship that's based on trust and mutual respect. For Bond, it's not about his service to her Majesty, but rather filling the void in his otherwise empty soul. For M, she may come across as cold and manipulative, but like Bond knows the stakes of the game they are playing.It's hard to discuss ""Skyfall"" without mention of its memorable villain, Silva. After delivering a chilling, award-winning turn in ""No Country for Old Men,"" Bardem gives another standout performance as the bleached blonde, impeccably dressed terrorist. Like every Bond villain, quirky mannerisms and odd physical traits are present. He's playful at times and whimsically sadistic at others. Like the rest of the film, Silva's motivation feels more believable than previous villains as he simply wants revenge on those who wronged him rather than being hell bent on world destruction.The man responsible for delivering us such a thrilling entry to the series is none other than Academy Award winning director Sam Mendes (American Beauty). I was shocked to see that his new approach to the material isn't necessarily out with the old and in with the new. Mendes gives plenty of winks and nods to all the Bond classics: the cars, the girls, the gadgets, the exotic locations, the dry one-liners and the occasional over-the-top stunts are all present. He even resurrects the old but familiar character of Q (Ben Whishaw), to provide some comedic relief and self deprecating humor to the series.But what Mendes does differently is that he presents the story as if it were actually a real world scenario. The atmosphere is dark, the drama is amped up and the characters feel real. The icing on the cake is cinematography. The action sequences are crisp and coherent and will literally have you jumping out of your chair. And whether it's the neon skylines of Shanghai or the grey skies of London, the shadowy landscapes set the stage for a bleak espionage-filled world. And also worth noting is the obligatory opening credit sequence that visually arresting and equally haunting with Adele providing vocals.Mendes' approach to Bond will be undoubtedly compared to Christopher Nolan's Batman redux, both humanizing established material and presenting it in a sleek and stylish way. It's just a shame for future entries because the bar has just been raised high. Not only is this new Bond entry the most thrilling and emotional to date, but it is responsible for bringing new energy and excitement into a franchise that doesn't seem to quit ... just like the central character.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond is back,"Ian Fleming would be quite proud of this fast paced, down to earth, yet larger than life Bond movie. Skyfall shows the more human side of Bond, which is something that is rarely seen outside of his drinking habits and taste in women. Daniel Craig shows that he's not only got the swagger and brute-force to be Bond, but also the fatigue and never-give-up attitude that comes with being a more tested and human Bond than any other actor has been able to do before. Is he the best Bond ever? I say so.Javier Bardem puts on a masterful show as Silva, a true Bond villain who's brilliance is only matched by his unflinching cruelty. This potent combination of brawn and brilliance makes Skyfall the most relevant and personal Bond in years, and everyone, from causal fans to die hard Bond fans like myself, can thoroughly enjoy the it's excellence. There are 4 words that can sum up one of the best movies of the year, and my personal favorite Bond movie of them all: welcome back, Mr. Bond.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"All the elements and feeling, too!","I loved this movie. Daniel Craig is my fav Bond, even over Sean. Why? Because his portrayal of Bond is more real, better acted with action and great camera work/photography.Anyway, this Bond movie was the best so far because it took us into the lives of these characters more than ever before, IMO. There is action enough for the action hounds (like me) and good scenery, not an overindulgence of gratuitous sex scenes but enough to keep the storyline going and Bond's reputation in tact.I saw a different Bond in this movie - to me, I saw the humanness of this super agent. I liked the new characters and the actors who portrayed them. Loved Ralph Fiennes, Javier Bardem and OF COURSE, Judi Dench. Gosh, she's good. What a great ride this movie was because it had all the elements of an entertaining, action-filled, emotion-filled movie that delved more into the characters that I've come to love. Then it added some new faces that I cannot wait to see again!Daniel Craig's bright blue eyes (great body) and brooding demeanor are perfect for a man who has seen so much destruction as James Bond. That's why he's the best Bond yet. Big shoes to fill when he retires! But let's not think about that yet...I say without reservation...see this movie.

"Run - don't walk to see this, a proper movie","This is the shortest 2 hour and 23 minute movie I have ever seen. From the opening scene through to the end, this movie just pulled me through.It had real story lines threading through it, hence my rating this as a proper movie. It was not just action, or gizmos, although it has plenty of those, but for once these things just support rather than being the story.Its worth pointing out, in contrast to all the nay-sayers slating this movie, that it is the only Bond movie to make it onto IMDb's top 250 list. Also it is the largest grossing movie in the top 10 in its third weekend making more than all the other nine movies after it combined.I like a movie that works at many levels that has grown-up themes as well as action and drama. If you are expecting a thrill ride that does all the story-plot thinking for you, then it possibly is not the movie for you. However if you like something that leaves you turning the story over in your mind afterwards, then this is a treat.The movie never stumbled of failed me once.

"""Sometimes the old ways are the best.""","As the 23rd official James Bond film overall (and the third starring Daniel Craig), Skyfall starts off fresh and thrilling with a really impressive chase scene throughout Istanbul...then, the film and character literally plunges into the depths of stark new territory. The film does go on to cover some standard James Bond ground for the first act: Bond still hobnobs around casinos, drinks a vodka martini, chases after some girls...but throughout the second half, all of the stakes were raised so substantially, it pushed the characters to their limits. With all the bold, thrilling plot twists and turns, Skyfall is to 007 what The Dark Knight was to Batman: in both cases, the heroes tread along a knife's edge and go through extreme measures to ensure victory.Rest assured, the film still entertains every bit as much as the other films of the franchise. Despite a few slow parts, most of it (especially in the last half) remains consistently suspenseful, thrilling, exciting, and even humorous at times. There are even a huge number of references and nods to established elements of Bond lore, and by the film's end, it feels as though one age of Bond has passed and another has begun (which is funny, because I thought the transition was more or less complete after Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace; it goes to show that the filmmakers still have some aces up their sleeves).The story for this film is quite sound, and amazingly thoughtful. From the start, it emphasizes James Bond's seniority, as he suffers in the line of duty, feels the burden of aging, and as politicians put his usefulness into question. The film goes on to talk about the old vs the new, or the past vs the present, and it does an effective job of mixing the old and the new in interesting ways. These key themes and conflicts keep the plot running, and ultimately spurs newfound life and depth in the characters, for both Bond and the villain he ultimately uncovers. Their interactions prove to be quite profound; many of Bond's most memorable villains have been foil characters, but in this case, I really got the feeling that this villain would have been Bond himself if things were different. Given the character motivations, the rising stakes, and the ultimate climax, the film showcases one of the most unusual and most hard-hitting Bond stories of the lot. Purists may find it totally uninteresting, but it'll strike a stronger chord with the modern generation, for the film proves that James Bond is still the man.As expected, the film looks nice and slick. A bit drab in terms of tone and color design (for better or for worse), but the camera work is decent, and the editing is good (thankfully, not nearly as screwy as Quantum of Solace). Acting is great; Daniel Craig is still perfect as James Bond, while Judi Dench continues to play it tough as M, and Javier Bardem puts on a nuanced performance (despite playing a rather weird, child-like character). Ralph Fiennes and Naomie Harris are both a pleasure to watch as well. The writing is quite slick, full of wit and depth. This production does a fine job with the sets, props, and costumes. I've seen plenty of folks complaining about the special effects, but they never really bothered me that much. Same with the music; I love Thomas Newman's score, regardless of how different it is from the usual works of David Arnold or John Barry. And, I do love Adele's theme song.I definitely enjoyed this film, and it would rank pretty high on my list of favorite 007 films. Whether you're a fan or not, the film is certainly worth checking out.Recommended!4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Right back to where it started from...,"When I first saw Casino Royale I remember enjoying it, then after processing it I felt as though the film itself was just not even comparable to any of it's predecessors. Not because it was bad, (although it's successor was not as intriguing),but because it decided to stray away from the Bond formula I came to understand, that and even the tone and style had a different feel to it.I was also confused as to whether or not Craig's run as Bond was an entirely new take on an all too familiar plot, or if it was a continuation of the Bond series with a new ""Bond"" whose filling in the position of it's previous title holder. (Which if that were the case he would have technically only been the third 00 agent to fill in as Bond, seeing as all Bond's, but Brosnan, mention the death of his wife Tracy Draco.I am pleased to say that I finally have the clarification I was looking for, and that all of Craig's previous outings as Bond have all boiled down to this one... A reboot is what this new franchise is, and a damn good one if you ask me. Although these past three Bond films have been rather grounded (unlike the fun and thrilling Moonraker), his instalments are still exciting to watch with even Quantum of Solace having its moments of sheer pulse pounding excitement. But I must admit that Skyfall in particular had it all and writers Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan really brought the story back to it's roots, and yes all back to where it started from. Credit must also be given to its director Sam Mendes, and cinematographer Roger Deakins. Skyfall brings back the classic bond, at times with humorous references made, and homages to the franchise that it just sends a shiver of nostalgia down your spine, that makes you say to yourself ""Bond is finally back!"" The classic Bond series mixed in with the modernist interpretation of the series, really make it one of the ultimate Bond films since (insert favourite Bond film here --->______________!)Before I risk spoiling anything, I will conclude by saying this is a Bond film worth viewing, and is definitely is one for both fans of the franchise and those who have only been recently introduced.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

The 2nd-best Bond movie.,"I don't completely appreciate Q being so smart but not giving Bond any gadgets (although it does make some sense). But I love the fact that Bond became so realistic and vulnerable. Daniel Craig proves yet again why he is the best James Bond ever, period.Ever since I watched this movie when it released, I've seen it multiple times, and each time was richly rewarding. The movie was never about how cool it could get. It was about the relationships that threaten the lives of these spies. The idea of maternal relationship overtones between 007 and M (or between M and Raoul Silva) was a masterful idea. One can see the similarities with GoldenEye (which is another Bond classic), but Skyfall is an improved version of the whole ""expendable spy-turned-villain"" trope. Bardem was brilliant as Silva, but it really was Judi Dench who took the cake. She played someone who knew the consequences of her actions, and was willing to live with them. She had the hardest job of all.Let's not forget the jaw-dropping cinematography by a confirmed legend who goes by the name Roger Deakins. That shot of Bond running on the ice with fireworks behind is one of the best shots in movie history. Great opening sequence, all too haunting (thanks in part to Adele).I didn't think I would ever say this, but Skyfall was actually one of the best movies of 2012. Certainly more memorable than that year's Oscar nominees for me. It only falls behind Casino Royale for me. Otherwise, it deserves a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

What amazes me more is the IMDb film budget of £ 200,000,000. Cant for the life of me think where it went apart from the ever expanding salaries. When this film gets edited for TV no doubt for a commercial channel, 33% of it will disappear to make way for adverts.

"Great action, great scenes, mediocre story and weak characters","I can see this movie has received very mixed reviews. A lot of IMDb users hates it with a passion, a lot think that it's mediocre, and some loves it. All critics loves it. I was personally loving it during the beginning. The intro song was not the best ever, but it was okay. The intro scenes however were awesome. The action scenes in the beginning were awesome as well, especially the chase scene. The cinematography and soundtrack was great as well. Very beautiful shots of the cities(especially London, felt very ""londonish"") and landscape. Some of the still shots of Bond were a bit melodramatic but beautiful as well, also; clichées are allowed in a Bond movie (well done clichées that is). The villain was great as well (Javier Bardem is up there as one of the greatest villain actors ever). Overall, the acting was very good.Now for the bad stuff. The story was a bit weak. I can accept that Bond is pushing the boundaries of realism, but why did he need to get shot, fall 100 feet, land on his back in the water, then get sucked in to a waterfall? It makes no sense. If he just got shot and passed out, and fell 10 feet or something like that, it had been much more acceptable. Not that it matters a lot, but it does bug me a little. I also know that hacking is the new magic in Hollywood, but it became a bit ridiculous in this movie. They should start to become a bit more aware of the fact that the audience is getting more knowledgeable about computers, programming etc. There is no need to present ""hacking"" as some kind of magic universe where everything is possible, like presenting the hackers monitor as some kind of visual labyrinth in which you need to maneuver through an orb of 1's and 0's, or the annoying ""the faster you type, the better you are hacking"" rule etc. Some of the characters were also a bit weak.

Double 0-verrated.,"After the disappointment that was Casino Royale, I decided to give Quantum of Solace a miss altogether on account of the very mixed reviews (to date, it is the only Bond film that I still haven't seen); Skyfall, on the other hand, had been getting such unanimous glowing praise that I simply had to check it out for myself, if only to confirm my suspicions that viewers had been letting their sense of relief that it didn't suck as much as the last two films to seriously affect their judgement.Just as I imagined, those who have been claiming that this is the best Bond ever are only fooling themselves. The film begins in great style with an incredible chase scene, one that really gets the adrenaline pumping, but this promising starts only serves to highlight just how badly mishandled the rest of the film is. With far more conversation than chaos and a running time of well over two hours, Skyfall really drags in places.The introduction of Javier Bardem's Silva, an intriguing mix of John Malkovich from In the Line of Fire and both Hannibal Lector and Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs, improves matters slightly, giving the plot some much needed focus, but the overall lack of action and adventure is still all too apparent (the only other memorable set-piece being a spectacular underground train crash/chase scene), as are the script's more convoluted elements and irritating plot holes.The final act, which culminates in a showdown between Bond and the baddies at his family pile in the Scottish highlands, fails to save the day, being atypically Bond in almost every respect: the locale is dreary, the cinematography is dark, the weaponry outdated, and the overall tone way too sombre.It's a shame, because Daniel Craig makes for a good 007—I just hope that they give him the Bond project that he deserves before he gets too old to play the part.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

It's won me over,"I'm one of those people who despises Daniel Craig's 'Bond era.' Not because I don't like him as an actor, or that I think he isn't the right man to play Bond. It's because I pine for the old days of loads of over-the-top gadgets, silly stunts and cheeky witticisms, delivered with a wry smile (or a raised eyebrow). In short, I liked pre-Craig Bonds.I watched both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace and barely considered them entries in the Bond franchise, yet I still came back for more and watched Skyfall.I'm glad I did. Bond is back. Yes, it was still gritty with a fairy revolutionary narrative structure (well, for a Bond film, anyway), but they've finally got round to inputting a little bit more humour in there. I'm not talking about gags all the way, but the (re)introduction of Q and Moneypenny are long overdue, as - like always - they play their part in verbally sparring with Bond (and sometimes putting him in his place). Plus the film-makers seemed to have remembered to play the 'Bond theme' a lot more. I felt this certainly helps remind me that I'm not watching just another 'Bourne' film starring Matt Damon or that other bloke who took over.Basically, I won't go into details about the plot too much. If you don't know already, it's not about someone in a volcano lair, trying to take over the world. If anything, it's much smaller, but better with it. It certainly brings global terrorism down to a personal level.Skyfall is definitely the best of the (new) Bonds. Long may it continue in this style.(I still miss John Cleese though).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
An opportunity gone wasted,"Skyfall was not a typical James Bond with cool gadgets and cars , high octane action scenes. It is purely story-oriented which would be little bit disappointing for James Bond fans.M's past comes back to haunt her and is threatening to kill her. 007 must track down the killer at any cost before he comes forward to hunt down MDirected by Sam Mendes ( American Beauty) , Skyfall starts off very well with well choreographed beginning scene(usually the charm of a James Bond film) but loses the steam somewhere down the line and it will make you wonder if you are watching a bond film or just some other action drama. The problem with Skyfall is the must-see trailer which will build the excitement but will be sagged down by weak screenplay. Before watching Skyfall , I heard a lot about the mindblowing reviews but was surprise to see whether if the movie was even close to those glowing reviews. Even Sam Mendes direction is not in form. James Bond film is more of punching dialogues , high octane action stunts( like Casino Royale) and cool gadgets which is clearly missing here. Story is catchy. Screenplay could have been more crispy  action scenes are just about fine. Dialogues are less impacting. Cinematography is nice- watch for the beautiful camera work done while filming action scene in the skyscraper of Shanghai city. Performance by Daniel Craig , Judi Dench and Xavier Bardem is what drives the movie. Each of them played their character with convinced attitude.Skyfall could have been made much better considering it to be directed by Sam Mendes but I felt less satisfied with movie on the overall basis.

The Daniel Craig movie we've been waiting for!,"Having been a bond fan for many years I found myself feeling extremely disappointed after watching Daniel Craig's previous bond film (Quantum of Solace) which I felt lacked an engaging plot and interesting characters. So naturally I was sceptical about this picture. However, within the first 10/20 minutes the film asserted itself as being far more grown up, intriguing and polished than the previous film. It feels as though the franchise has stepped into new territory with new characters.Positive points; - Feels modern and polished. - Interesting narrative. - New characters feel fresh. - Intriguing villain performed faultlessly by Javier Bardem. - The Daniel Craig Bong we've all been waiting for.Negative points; - Javier Bardem's character first appears half way through the film, because of his immense performance I would have liked to see more of him. - Bond decrypting the secret code from Silva's laptop was unbelievable.I think we were all questioning Daniel Craig after the slow (yet still interesting) Casino Royale and the mess that was Quantum of Solace. But now we can rest easy after finally seeing Mr Craig filling his potential. All in all, this is possibly one of my favourite bond films. 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of The Greatest Action Films of All Time,"Skyfall is always going to be a special film for me. It's the first Bond film I ever saw in theatres and I vividly remember the hype this film had from Everyone around me. The film was everything I wanted it to be and more, to date it is my favourite Bond film of all time and, for my money, one of the best action films of all time.One of the best things about Craig's film is that they make Bond into an actual character. He has his weaknesses and strengths and they're all conveyed perfectly in a way that makes him a better protagonist. Daniel Craig is again amazing as Bond it's a much more subtle performance than before that make his more emotional scenes a lot more fulfilling. It also gives the character a past and allows the audience to better understand how he became the man he did.Sam Mendes is a terrific director, despite him not being know for action before this film I think he absolutely nailed it with this film. The action is absolutely pulse pounding and gritty, there's not a single action scene that isn't great and improves massively over the shaky nonsense that was present in Quantum. The film also looks spectacular thanks to Roger Deakin's cinematography, every single location looks different and every frame is visually alive . Without a doubt the best looking bond film of all time.A great villains can make or break a bond films so it's so gratifying to say that this film has a truly wonderful one. Silva, played to perfection by Javier Bardem is a magnificent villain and one of bonds best foes. He has a fantastic backstory that really makes him a more personal villain than most villain. It's also great to see another unhinged villain in the bind series. The character is completely insane and it makes for a captivating presence. Bardem nailed his performance, another villain he played perfectly.More than any other bond film, Skyfall made excellent use of its supporting cast. They all have a part to play big or small. Judi Dench gives her best performance as M in this film, her chemistry with Craig is perfect that makes the film about their relationship just as much as anything else. Moneypenny has a perfect return to the series, with her excellent chemistry with Bond and giving her a backstory as opposed to the fairly one note character that was present in the other iterations. It was also great to see Q back in the franchise as a younger less experienced version of the character. He has an excellent back and forth with Bond that creates for comedy gold and excellent dialogue. It's great to see Ralph Fiennes in the film that establishes him as a new presence in the franchise that makes it more satisfying to see him continue to play of Bond in future films.Skyfall is a complete masterclass in acting, directing, action sequences and cinematography. It's the perfect action and bond film, my favourite in the series and it's going to take a lot for future films to beat it. It's one of the few films that both old school and new school fans can love and appreciate.10/10 - A+ (Incredible)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
An excellent bond with the cast to match.,"I really don't understand the overwhelming list of bad reviews that Skyfall has been given. Perhaps the basis of this hate lies within the minds of old school bond lovers who are enclosed in the pious belief that if its not Connery its not bond. Skyfall more than holds its own, I myself will more than admit that perhaps Casio royal and Quantum of Solace are poor in every sense of the word.However Skyfall has cinematography that is truly beautiful and that really can't be argued with. For those critics who argue that there are multiple plot holes, its's James bond, the last time I remembered invisible cars exist. oh wait yeah its a fiction film, I'm sure people like you would question how James bond has looked so different over the years, again he is played by different actors.Have a go at the critics all you want, the public doesn't lie and this is one of the most popular bond films of all time. Adele's opening is excellent, I doubt it would have won an academy award had it not been. Daniel Craig is very much Ian Fleming's bond and he pulls off the role with brilliant conviction and principle.So many reviews take apart the unbelievably of this film, however they also bring up the issue of the lack of gadgets, make up your mind please. For anybody who hasn't seen this film it really is an excellent watch, however I wouldn't recommend it if your only interesting in picking out plot floors, at the end of the day its a fiction film and if you want to make a true to life film go ahead. I look forward to seeing bureaucracy the new bond movie where it takes him 6 health and safety forms in order to begin a chase and then 2 hours of filing out liability forms after he bumps a car.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Welcome return to form,"James Bond's latest adventure may not be the game-changing piece of cinema that I was hoping for (after CASINO ROYALE, with its new heights of intense thrills and heartfelt emotion), but at least it's a step up from Bond's previous misfire, QUANTUM OF SOLACE. SKYFALL sees Daniel Craig returning to the role for a third time, and there's a distinctly different feel to his story this time around: he's ageing, in many ways past it, something of a dinosaur in a world of youth. The suddenness of this transformation is surprising, but at least it marks new territory for the series.Not so elsewhere, as for the first time in the Craig canon we see the return of many familiar tropes: Q is back (in the guise of the remarkable Ben Whishaw), along with Moneypenny, the gadgets, the cars. It feels a little odd to see these much-loved elements returning to the fold a mere two films after the film that made a show of doing away with them altogether, but nonetheless they're handled well and with a minimum of both fuss and cheesiness.A shame, then, that all of this hinges on a central plot that actually turns out to be, well, pretty unremarkable. The slightly creepy Javier Bardem makes for a memorable bad guy – sometimes for all the wrong reasons – but the plot is nothing more than a simple revenge story, and an early sub-plot about Bond's disappearance turns out to have little to do with anything other than wasting forty minutes of the running time. At 2 hours, 23 minutes, SKYFALL feels a little sluggish in places, flabby when it should be pushing on with momentum.The good news is that the action is much better than that of the previous outing. Marc Forster didn't know what he was doing in his attempts to emulate the shaky-cam work of Paul Greengrass, but director Sam Mendes is here confident enough to jettison the shaky-cam in favour of some elaborate, big budget, old-fashioned set pieces. A blistering chase sequence kicks things off and an explosive home invasion style climax ends things, and in between we get some great stuff going on in the Tube. A trip to Shanghai is less successful, but for the most part, SKYFALL works. Yes, the action is CGI heavy at all times, but this is decent CGI that adds rather than detracts from the experience.Acting-wise, the film is less successful. For the first time, Craig doesn't feel particularly likable here. His quips and wisecracks have the effect of making him seem conceited rather than smart, and the hot-pot of writers who crafted the script are far too obsessed with creating pretentiously clever lines so that it really grates sometimes. Judi Dench offers the same one-dimensional bullishness that she's been slapping out since Goldeneye, but Ralph Fiennes is a welcome addition to the rank of officials and Rory Kinnear's return is another plus. Bardem is less impressive, hissing out lines like he's in a pantomime, and of the Bond girls Naomie Harris struggles with a light and superfluous character. Far better is Berenice Marlohe as a sultry femme fatale, although sadly she's only given extremely limited screen time. Still, SKYFALL is nothing less than an entertaining movie, despite the many plot holes and occasional inanities; fans will be in their element.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Excellent,"I was dubious about this film. I enjoy the James Bond books immensely, and loved Casino Royal (film), feeling that it remained fairly true to the storyline and dark feel of the book. After Quantum of Solace, which was a disappointment in my opinion, I was worried that this would go down the same road, especially as it was not originally a book. I was very pleasantly surprised. Daniel Craig is fantastic in his role, he is pretty much the way that I imagine Bond to be. The film has just the right amount of over the top action scenes, without going too far like some films previously have. The storyline was excellent, tackling Bond's demons well, with both an ensnaring and entertaining story throughout. Overall a very good addition to the James Bond franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the greats!  A must see for Bond fans and new viewers alike.,"I meant that for me by the way. This was my first experience with seeing a Bond movie in theaters,and dude, it was totally awesome! After therather strange and cluttered bit of...stuff, that was Quantam of Solace, Skyfall feels very much like the continuation of Casino Royale.For those not in the know, Skyfall represents the 50th anniversary of 007 as a film franchise, and boy does it do a better job of celebrating the films of old than the OTHER ""celebratory"" film Die Another Day (made for the 40th anniversary).Too start with, Daniel Craig cements himself (for me anyway) as the definitive James Bond with this performance. Craig's Bond has just the right mix of humor, suave, and brutality, making endearing but by no means the prototypical ""good guy"". Craig could have easily carried the whole film on his own, but he also has a fleshed out and intriguing supporting cast. Judi Dench returns as M, who's much more of a key player this time around, being the target of the villainous Silva (played by Javier Bardem).Several other supporting characters get to play key roles throughout the film, but Skyfall's story is a deeply personal one for the three main characters, something that, along with the several little references (and re-establishing) of Bond film staples, makes Skfall a great jumping on point for new fans.The plot is well constructed, and what few little niggles the story has do nothing to detract from how great it was put together. Action setpieces aren't over used and over saturated like they were in Quantam of Solace or Die Another Day, and not one scene in the movie feels unnecessary.To talk too much about the film would spoil a lot of surprises, but safe to say it easily ranks among the best of the Bond films, and climbs to my personal #1 spot. It's obvious Skyfall was made by people with nothing but love for 007, and the film serves as a nice merger of all of the previous eras of Bond with the more gritty and modern Bond.In short it's a good movie. Go watch it. Now. Do it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"Reconciling the edgy, gritty ""Casino Royale"" Bond with the classic suave Connery/Moore/Brosnan Bond, ""Skyfall"" is a great transition film and maybe Craig's best outing yet!","The thing that really struck me about ""Skyfall"", Daniel Craig's third outing as the iconic character James Bond after the amazing ""Casino Royale"" and the very so-so follow-up ""Quantum of Solace"", was that this film is very much a transitional piece for the character. ""Casino Royale"" and ""Quantum"" are both very much products of their time, taking cues more from the Bourne films and other gritty reboots than the classic Bond movies from yester-year. This film begins to really transition and change that, reconciling Craig's previous dark, brooding take on the character with the classic, suave Bond we knew for decades before. And it works. It works darned well.Directed by Sam Mendes and written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan, ""Skyfall"" is the 23rd entry in the Bond film series, although it's technically the third entry in the Daniel Craig Reboot series. (As this film, along with ""Casino Royale"" and ""Quantum"", are essentially the start of a new continuity)After a riveting, exciting opening chase sequence that puts the shaky-cam opening chase from ""Quantum"" to shame, Bond (Craig) is accidentally shot by fellow agent Eve (Naomie Harris), and presumed dead after his limp body tumbles into a river. Bond is of course alive, and using his presumed death to retire from MI6. However, after a terrorist bombing on MI6 and threats against the life of MI6 head M (Judi Dench), Bond is forced back into action. With the help of the new Q (Ben Whishaw), Bond tracks the villainous Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), attempting to stop his plot of vengeance against MI6.The acting is essentially flawless all around. Craig seems more comfortable with Bond, still maintaining his dark edge, while adding a bit of the classic suave and complexity to the character. Dench is a joy, as always, as M. Naomie Harris is a lot of fun as Eve, Bond's fellow agent. Ben Whishaw is fantastic as the new Q. And Javier Bardem is both tragic and terrifying as Silva, the lead villain. Other characters played by the likes of Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney are also fantastic.The production is also top-notch. Mendes' direction is some of the best in the series. Thankfully, he eschewed the shaky-cam work that Marc Forster introduced in the prior film, and presents us with some first-class action, without relying too much on CGI. The script is tight, concise, and simpler than previous films, giving us a more elegant, easy-to-follow-yet-still-deep-and-complex storyline, which was nice as a few prior films got too convoluted. Costume and production design are absolutely gorgeous. There is almost nothing to complain about with the production.I usually try to think of a few things to complain about, but here, it's near impossible. This is a flawless Bond film and a flawless picture in general.I loved ""Skyfall."" It's possibly Craig's best outing yet, and re-invigorates the franchise yet again.

Bond Reporting,"Enter ""Casino Royale."" The 2006 Bond film introduced audiences to a new 007 (Daniel Craig) and a more realistic and consequential Bond universe.

Sadly, the gains made by ""Casino Royale"" were quickly erased by its terribly bland 2008 follow up ""Quantum of Solace.""

Positioning Bond as a human being who is aging and has limits was a fine idea given we that we are celebrating half a century of movies. I also liked the increased use of humor - it was just right, not over-done.

The story delves deeper into the characters of its principles than any other film in the series. It feels like a story that Fleming himself could have written. The pacing is steady. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is breathtaking, along with the razor sharp editing by Stuart Baird. Craig claims the mantle of Bond for himself. Javier Bardem is the creepiest Bond villain of all time. He equals, if not surpasses, his Oscar winning performance in ""No Country For Old Men.""

"Back in action again, with some pleasure","After 50 years since the first, Dr. No, everyone knew that Skyfall, wisely picked this time to be released not 2 years but 4 since the last one, was going to be an event, and by all accounts, it was. Anticipated by one of the best themes in all 007 movies, apparently made in 10 min by Adele, which seems a bit odd. But once the most famous character in cinema wore off, did the odd-job still have anything to add to the franchising? The answer is yes, Dr. Yes, with pleasure. One of the things about 007 Daniel Craig era is that the hero is no longer a superhero and the superhuman spy is after all very human. Sam Mendes, a gifted director, explored that nicely. With the addiction of 3 great actors: Ben Whishaw, Ralph Fiennes and, of course, Javier Bardem that again and again delivers the goods. Sam and his writers saw what any fan of the secret agent feels: the decay of Bond girls (anyone can recall the last greatest bond girl?) For years and years fans wanted the films to be more explicit. Make no mistake this isn't classic vintage 007 style club. That said, while this is still a 007 film, much of the credit goes for the clever way the writers tried to cover that fact, creating a virtual 007 with epic tones, an agent caught between the old-fashioned ways and the modern ones, being this interaction hugely a high point. In fact, Sam Mendes adds some splendid cinematographic details all over the place, you can tell this is a guy who spent much time, apart from his career, digging into movies. Unfortunently, the story isn't that amazing, still original in 007 catalog yet not so strong compared to the previous 2, nevertheless despite the excellent directing and solid performances, the script goes plain and simple in one way only. After 2h of quickly delivered scenes there's only one place left: Skyfall. The expanded Skyfall treatment sees some powerful imagery that will appeal too all kinds of audience. Largely held by Sam Mendes and Daniel Craig and nobody does it better. The image quality, as expected, is excellent, allowing the viewer to experience every detail of a Bond mixed into the past and the present. The dislocated island and the final set should impress those unfamiliar with 007 and surely thrill longtime fans. The famous Bond's shots are still here. The script didn't allowed more humor, that surely be welcome, but this is a very small quibble about the secret agent in our century. It's a fine testament to a timeless 007 that doesn't sound dated, on the contrary this the best era singe Roger Moore and finally back in action again, in the right place this time. This film plays great whether you're a fan of James Bond or not.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Nutshell Review: Skyfall,"It's the 50th anniversary of Ian Fleming's James Bond on the big screen, and the character is celebrating that milestone with his 23rd film outing in what would be the longest running film franchise that had seen the mantle being passed on from actor to actor, and helmed by various directors providing their vision of the debonair spy in Her Majesty's Secret Service. Skyfall continues the good work set out by Casino Royale, with director Sam Mendes achieving a remarkable balance between celebrating that milestone jubilee, while setting the stage for the future films with potential to be fulfilled.Skyfall is an ominous sounding title, and the events here close a chapter, and reopens another, with two more Bond films in the works and may be shot back to back to compensate the rather long gap of four years between this one, and the rather lacklustre Quantum of Solace. We're still firmly into Bond's reboot of sorts with Martin Campbell taking over the reins with Casino Royale after having done so with GoldenEye, which charted Daniel Craig's induction as the new Bond, and two films on we have seen a more serious Bond at work, as compared to his predecessors. This film will change all that, through the subtleties in giving Bond that unmistakable sense of humour, and the introduction of a Q branch boasting a youthful looking Q in Ben Whishaw, which puts the character in very different light from versions of the past, and promising much more fanciful gadgets (or perhaps maybe not, given the rather old school-ness of this Q) in the coming installments.And by the time the end credits roll, much of the Bond elements missing from the Craig versions so far, will have been introduced, which is a fitting way to celebrate one's 50th year, in a way going full circle. But that doesn't mean alienating the established fan base who grew from the era of Sean Connery's version, or any of the other earlier incarnations. The scribes in Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan managed to weave in a number of easter eggs from James Bond's film history into the movie, which is an extremely nice touch when they appear, to rapturous applause by audience members who instantly recognized those blast from the past nods.But the story's not all nostalgia, as it deals with a more immediate, direct and personal threat this time round, as compared to the more bombastic, dastardly plans that classic Bond villains usually have. It deals with the challenges any security agency would face in today's environment where the enemy is seldom overtly known, but having gone underground, and is rather faceless, yet ready to strike at any time. Javier Bardem got invited by Daniel Craig to play the villainous Silva, a one time collaborator under M (Judi Dench), but now hell bent on seeking revenge against M for what he calls as sins of the past. Which Bond is now only too familiar with given the prologue's botched attempt at retrieving a sacred hard drive, and M's insistence on sticking to her guns and judgement call when instructing another fellow agent Eve (Naomie Harris) to take a shot that resulting in his temporal retirement from active service.And it's rather interesting here to see a less than able Bond at work, as compared to the earlier versions where his feathers were rarely ruffled. Here, he huffs and puffs his way through, and in some ways, found himself in pretty unfamiliar territory despite London being called home. In most, if not all, of the films, he would be jet setting to exotic locations, and rarely had to operate at home, so having Bond back in London and fighting for what he believes in, is another cinematic milestone that took some 23 years to come to fruition. Daniel Craig's Bond has never been quite the polished, finished article, and this film continues in his development as the master spy, albeit one who is rather out of shape and out of touch for the most parts.The villains here were a little less colourful than their counterparts in earlier films, and I suppose Bardem's Silva is likely to polarize audiences between thinking he's the epitome of evil, or a rather ineffective one that falls into the usual trappings. There's a distinct lack of a colourful henchman as well, although Patrice (Ola Rapace) did share a very elegantly shot fight sequence with Bond, completely in silhouette, in Shanghai. Sam Mendes puts the style back into the Bond franchise, allowing this installment to stand head and shoulders above other more contemporary spy films, that any Bond film would be proud of.While other touches such as the introduction of Kincade (Albert Finney) for that connection and bit exploration into Bond's past, and Ralph Fiennes' Gareth Mallory to verbal spar with M, perhaps the Bond girls this time round lacked a little bit of presence. In fact I would like to suggest that THE Bond girl here is M herself, for having this story centered around her and the dedicated screen time she gets, as compared to the likes of Harris' Eve as a field operative with a nice final treatment, and Berenice Marlohe's Severine, which is that classical femme fatale that didn't have much to do, really.Still, there's a lot more to love in this Bond film that would rank it as good as Craig's initial film, with a more intimate plot setting that strikes closer to the heart and souls of the principal characters involved, while keeping the doors very much wide open for more adventures given a new team set in place. Sam Mendes now has the origins assembled proper, which only promises of better things yet to come in the future. Happy 50th anniversary Mr Bond!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond doesn't need an exploding pen anymore...,"What I loved about the re-boot series starting in Casino Royale is that the film presented us with more a true character resembled in Iam Flemings books.In Skyfall nearly all the gadgets are out and Bond is presented nothing but his Walter PPK and a tracker. (No more exploding pens, which we last saw in Goldeneye).Skyfall presents itself using all aspects a movie can be. Great flow, action, suspense, and of course a few nice laughs. In the movie we get a few nods from classics such as Goldfinger which is seen in the film. (Will not say encase you haven't seen the film. But it will put a smile on your a face) The actors in the film do an amazing job. Javier Bardem plays a great villain, with the likes of Judi Dench, Daniel Craig, Ralph Fiennes known for his hugely antagonist role as Lord Voldemort in the Harry Potter series also providing himself in a protagonist role.In Skyfall its a very true Bond film. The opening, the typical James Bond song, the way he presents himself and his womanizer personality. There are quite a few twists in this movie, and the name Skyfall becomes something more of a meaning as you progress more into the film...Bond doesn't need his exploding pen gadgets anymore. All he needs now is a knife, a gun and his fists and hes ready to kick some ass.SKYFALL is a must watch for any Bond fan. 10/10/",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best Bond Yet !,"I did not expect the bond movie ""sky fall"" to be so amazing this time partly because Bond it self sounds very monotonous and the we know its all about the spy game, but whats truly amazing this time is the PLOT of this movie which will blow your mind if you pay attention to the details of it. Great acting by all of the bond crew, wonderful theme/overall moral of the movie and a striking dialog "" orphans make...."" that psychological makes sense.A must watch for all Bond fans and of course Fans who love thriller movies and good plots.thanks for reading .",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Updated Bond Scores a Hit,"Daniel Craig as Bond is superb in this latest Bond flick. He is the quintessential 21st century Bond, cool, competent, but showing some scars from his past--physical and psychological. There may not be as many gadgets in this film, but all the other elements are there suspense, car chases,and death defying shootouts.Javier Bardem is as evil as it gets, remorseless, relentless, and laughing at the world as he does his terrible deeds.Judy Densch as ""M"" is the target this time as is MI6 itself.Bond who has been given up for dead, must come to the rescue.We learn a bit about Bond's past in this one. He is a little more human.All in all Skyfall is a satisfying movie experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Not My Favorite,"I see 9's and 10's for ratings for this movie, and I don't get it. This is my least favorite of the 4 Daniel Craig Bond movies. Every time the blonde-haired Javier Bardem comes on the screen I want to laugh. I just couldn't take him seriously. In my opinion he was not a good villain. This movie just seemed flat and I was frequently bored.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Daniel Craig returns with a bang in the best Bond yet,"""You know the rules of the game, you've been playing it all these years"", says Judi Dench to Craig's James Bond in an early scene. This line mirrors the importance of this year in the 007 canon; it has been half a decade since Sean Connery first donned the tux in Dr. No and over that time we've come to know Mr. Bond and experience the good, the bad and the ugly. For Skyfall, this birthday had to be kept in mind, as following the disappointing mess-and-a-half that was Quantum of (any?) Solace, the film had to be good, first and foremost, but it also couldn't be your regular Bond adventure - something had to change. Fortunately, director Sam Mendes (who worked with Craig on Road to Perdition) has breathed new life into this long- running franchise, taking bold moves that pay-off brilliantly.During an attempt to recover sensitive information from an enemy operative, Bond is mistakenly shot by a fellow agent (Naoime Harris). But when a cyber-terrorist (Javier Bardem) targets MI6, Bond returns, however he finds his loyalty to M tested as her past comes to haunt her.""All the physical stuff, so dull"", remarks Bardem's Silva in his first encounter with Bond. However, the same cannot be said for the film's action sequences - they are magnificent and exhilarating. From the Istanbul-set pre-credits scene to a heart-pounding chase which occurs on the London Underground, Skyfall delivers some of the best action since Bane came to Gotham or Iko Uwais had a few floors to climb. All these sequences are aided not only by Sam Mendes, but also by Roger Deakins' extraordinary cinematography, bringing a majesty to these scenes to rival Wally Pfister's recent work with Christopher Nolan. Highlights include a scrap inside a Shanghai skyscraper lit entirely by neon advertising and the one shot/ single take introduction to the antagonist.In Casino Royale, Daniel Craig took us all by storm, but with Quantum of (I don't see any) Solace, he experienced an unfortunate stumble; thankfully, within the opening seconds of Skyfall you can breathe a sigh of relief as Mr. Craig basically tells the audience that he's back and this time he means business. He has also never been better in the role, making it entirely his own and delivering sharp one-liners with dry and sardonic wit, whilst retaining nuance emotion and grit. Yet, this 23rd Eon outing belongs to Judi Dench just as much as it does to Craig; it has taken seven films, but M has finally been given the film she deserves, proving every bit as engaging ad 007 - she is the definitive Bond girl. Bardem is a wonderful standout in this impeccable cast; mildly camp, but properly menacing, he brings depth to the normally one-dimensional role of the 'Bond villain'.Yet much of the film's greatness belongs to Sam Mendes, he takes many audacious risks that most directors would pass over in favour of Bond conventions, and while the film's first hour does feature many of them, its second half delves into Bond and M's pasts, before descending to a Straw Dogs (Peckinpah)-esque Scotland-set third act, which oddly works. He brings a sophistication to the series, allowing a reading of Tennyson to sit seamlessly alongside a cameo from a particular car. This isn't just a brilliant Bond film, this is a brilliant film fullstop. Undoubtedly one of the films of the year, it's exciting, funny, tense and emotional - the 50th anniversary has brought with it the best Bond yet. I absolutely loved it and can't wait to see it again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"An Absolute  Pleasure, Mr Bond.","Just about the best 007 movie since On He Majesty's Secret Service, Skyfall also delivers on the promise Daniel Craig first showed in Casino Royale, but was squandered in Quantum of Solace. Here is a Bond with action to set your pulse racing from the off and a story that makes (almost) perfect sense. Beautifully photographed Roger Deakins and expertly directed by Sam Mendes no less, its great to see the copious talent involved in this long-delayed project has not been wasted. Javier Bardem is Bond villain in the classic mould and the gags are finally back but - and this is the thing - they're great gags (my personal favourite involves an old couple and a Tube train but you'll have your own). I saw it with an audience who cheered and applauded the climax. An absolute pleasure, Mr Bond.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond is back with a Vengeance,"Bond is back, and its fantastic to see him again! Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace were good but Sam Mendes- the director- has done his homework and it damn well shows!M (played by Judie Dench of course) has some enemies and they have finally come back to nip her on the butt. (Don't worry, that is all I will say about the plot!)The script is so well done, you truly do get the idea of impending doom and the only person who can save us all is 007 himself. Sure there are explosions, car chases, fights, etc but there are certainly less explosions and more of the traditional things in Bond movies.Adele's ""Skyfall"" theme tune is so amazing, it gave me tingles down my spine as the sequence starts, and believe me it is at a truly epic part of the movie!All the lead characters were played so well though I thought one of the bond girls (I won't name!) was on for too short a-time and it would have been nice to see more of her, calling her a Bond girl was slightly exaggerating as she is really just a plug in a small hole in the plot.This movie truly is going back to the old style of Bond, you will find a lot more tongue-in-cheek humour, a few more of the old-Bond characters are back. However, rather than being sentimental about it, they've brought Bond into the 21st Century (after 12 years, its good of them to join us) If you are a Bond fan, this is the movie for you, its great, action packed and just fantastically British!Bring on the next instalment!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond is back!,"I don't even know where to begin this... There isn't a single Bond-movie that has left me so excited or awestruck whilst watching it in the cinema. Perhaps it is not THE best 007, but it certainly is at the top. Especially after the utter rubbish that was Quantum of Solace this was by comparison sheer awesomeness.I will try to be as vague as possible so I won't spoil it for anybody:My main criteria of objection was the recycled themes from previous Bond-movies; the unwilling mistress of the villain (The Man With The Golden Gun) M's personal sub-plot in relation to the villain (The World Is Not Enough) an ex-00 seeking revenge on MI6 (Goldeneye) Bond's dedication to his friends/boss and avenging them (License To Kill) the tragic loss of a close one (On Her Majesty's Secret Service) and a certain item from Goldfinger which will make any true Bond-fan cream his or hers' pants in sheer excitement ;)As said; the ending left me simply speechless. I was at the point of tears and I have never felt such sympathy for bond since On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Screw Eva Green in Casino Royale, this ending is such more tragic I could not find the words.The lyrics of Adele's *Skyfall* actually make sense now.For the first time ever do we explore a bit of James Bond's past, namely that of his parents (we learn their names, where JB grew up as a child, etc.) We also find out M's real name.The Bond-girls were OK, but nothing spectacular. The new Q is cute but will have to live up to his epic predecessor Desmond Llewelyn. M is by all accounts spectacular in this movie. The villain, 'Tiago Rodriguez', also brings a new element in a JB- villain not seen before since Blofeld's henchmen in Diamonds Are Forever That being said I think they tried to make the villain too funny and can't take it that serious.Scores: Music: 7/10 (Adele's lyrics finally make sense and the Bond-music in the movie takes you back to the original series) Acting: 9/10 (the only one who's acting was not believable was that of the villain which was a bit tóó much...) Plot: 6/10 (too many recycled themes) Humour: 7/10 (some excellent one-liners) Gadgets: 3/10 (pretty much non-existent since the re-startConclusion: the end of Skyfall brings Bond back to the style of the original Bond-movies. Skyfall is definitely worth watching and by far the best since Goldeneye. Go see Skyfall!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best Bond Movie in years,"This film just adds a touch of class to the bond series. Craig is on great form here as Bond, struggling to get back his edge as the super spy. But this movie is owned by Judi Dench and Javier Bardem. The Villain here is similar to Villains of old such as Gold finger and Blofeld. He is truly menacing and he has some killer sarcasm at key moments in the movie. Overall this is a 10/10 for a Bond movie, it has everything you need. It adds a new Q played by Ben Wishaw famous for the the new TV show The Hour and you are introduced to a new character close to M played by Ralph Fiennes. Lets hope that Sam Mendes does one more Bond.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Back to the basics...,"Strip James Bond down to the basics, a man and his mind, and this is what you get. This is raw Bond, down in the dirt, with almost no devices (tiny radio-ish thingy), yet he is still expected to save the British Empire, which, of course, he does. Study the plot and you can see how it all leads to only one conclusion; the Bond that we have all learned to love over the last 50 years had to start somewhere, and this is where he starts.I won't go over any of the plot points (some are weak, most are not), or the character development (which is not in the least bit weak, except for the villain) but I will say that this is the most satisfying Bond I've seen since Sean Connery in ""From Russia With Love"", where Bond simply had himself (and a crappy briefcase) with which to defeat a very determined enemy. It is almost the same thing here. What you get is ""Bond"", period.There are those who do not like the new Bond, but after the previous five, I'd put Daniel Craig's Bond up against any of them, and I'm sure he would give them all (Even St. Sean, whom deserves all praise) a run for their money. The producers have very wisely rebooted the franchise and stripped it down to the bone, and if they keep this up, we will see a new, relevant Bond, for many more years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Very good, but Bond, James Bond is being rebooted","Agents for MI 6 are exposed. MI 6 is attacked. MI 6 relocates. M (Judi Dench) is on the hook for letting things get out of hand. Silva (Javier Bardem), once a trusted agent, feels betrayed by M and vows to kill her. M knows the only man she can trust is Bond, James Bond (Daniel Craig) to make things right. Let the games begin.Most of the action in here occurs in the first 20-minutes. And, this action is incredible. I had to duck numerous times. There is more very good action later on but nothing like the first 20-minutes. How they did all that is a mystery. Wow !I want to say this was the best Bond, James Bond ever, but I cannot. Bond, James Bond is being rebooted. Bond, James Bond wears a beard for too long a time. Not good. Looks too old with it and is hardly recognizable. Q (Ben Whishaw) is now a very young person who Bond, James Bond doesn't quite trust at first. Q only gives Bond, James Bond 2-toys to help him get out of jams. Only 2-toys? Oh, the horror! There is no baccarat or even poker although Bond, James Bond goes to a casino in China. Bond, James Bond gets his vodka martini, but the words ""shaken not stirred"" are never heard. There is no quirky one-liner Bond, James Bond is noted for after a tussle with a bad guy. The twinkle in the eye is never there. It was always there with the other guys, especially with Sean Connery. Bummer.Yes, changes are afoot for Bond, James Bond. You will be surprised to see who the new Moneypenny will be; but will Bond, James Bond toss his hat on the rack as he encounters Moneypenny before he sees M for his next assignment? These things are not important in the grand scheme of things, but they are things that endeared us to Bond, James Bond. And, we miss them. Bring them back.There are some other changes afoot but to reveal them would give too much away. However, the biggest thing in here is the villain, Silva. In past Bond, James Bond escapades there was never anything personal with the bad guys. This time it is very personal as you will see. And, yes, Javier Bardem as Silva is very scary.I feel the producers of the Bond, James Bond movies are making a mistake in aging everyone including Bond, James Bond. We do not want that. Like a favorite cartoon where the characters never age is the way Bond, James Bond should be portrayed. If they keep on the way they are going we will need a new Bond, James Bond soon. Hey, Daniel Craig is no spring chicken, you know.All my misgivings aside, this was still a very good Bond, James Bond movie. But, keep the white whiskers out of all this . Keep Bond, James Bond forever young and bring back those subtleties that keep us saying ""Bond, James Bond is our guy forever"" If you bring back the quips and the twinkle in the eye we will forgive everything else.

Didn't live up to the hype,"It took me a while to watch even Casino Royale, because I was annoyed they got rid of Pierce Brosnan. I finally watched Daniel Craig's movies and warmed up to him. I was excited about Skyfall because it was getting such crazy press, reviews, and success.On the surface, it was a very solid movie. However, the entertainment comes at the cost of huge plot holes and contrived ideas. MI6 are portrayed as complete idiots and buffoons, and the main villain is smarter than all of them put together and is nearly omnipotent. Similar to the Joker in The Dark Knight.If you can get passed the fact that the scenario involving the main villain couldn't possibly have happened, then you'll enjoy the movie.

It was a thrill ride for the ages. The actors performed so well and the characters were very well written indeed.

Bond with a difference..........,"Unveiling the old Aston Martin is the moment of the film for me and if nothing else SkyFall is a very commendable homage to 50 years of Bond bonding to all fans.Not a very intelligent plot or screenplay that was expected out of Sam Mendes, but its those small moments which makes you remember the different episodes watched over years.Daniel Craig is very good and brings out a humane Bond yet again.Judi Dench is as always.Ralph Fiennes is superb in his small role.Xavier Bardem nominates himself for ""Heath Ledger Memorial Award"" and gets your adrenaline pumping from the time he shows up.Though he arguably registers as the best Bond villain,I expected more from him which the otherwise flat script does not let him into.The whole low lit climax is an excellent work of camera while the rest of the film is too whitish( not sure if it was the issue with the theatre).Though Casino Royale still remains ""The Bond with the Best"" , SkyFall is definitely ""The Bond with a difference""....",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

The best Bond movie ever...,"Ian Fleming's James Bond (007) has been enthralling people around the globe for a long period of time. He holds us with extreme action, humor, style; super-fast cars and technology hyped electronic gazettes. Skyfall yet last released movie of James Bond and is very different from all other movies of the series.Skyfall portrays a Bond never seen before. Though his physical strengths are depressed his character is actually outstandingly strong. Moreover the terrorism shown in movie is a true reflection of present situation. Our enemies are no longer known to us, there is no specific battlefield. They don't have certain identity. As it is said in movie, 'They are not nations, no uniform they have'. Some other day we may find them at the next door. The world is truly in shadows.James has grown older now. He is not strong as we saw him previously. Physical and psychological tests highly reject him for field duty. MI6 is broken down. There best security systems are hacked. Government now doubts their efficiency. M herself is targeted by enemy.We observe resurrection of James Bond in this worst situation. Hero is not the one who comes from distant planet or star, he is not mutant neither he has superpowers. He is one of us. He has limitations and above all he is mortal. Bond shows intention and great determination is enough to be a hero. Movie itself has commented some lines on this fact, 'We are not as strong as we were in the past. We might have moved earth back then in time but it has changed now. We have become weak. Now muscles would not work but motivation can. And this is how some men with strong will fighting hard to save the world.'Concept and presentation is just outstanding.

The Dark Knight Returns,"Before and during the ""reboot"", the problem with the franchise was the number of close competitors. It actually started with ""xXx"", but continued more obviously with Jason Bourne, Batman, Mission Impossible and to some extent even with the recent Judge Dredd. The solo hero, not well understood, effectively battling himself or versions of himself.Sam Mendes had every reason to admire Christopher Nolan, and what he did with the excellent Batman movies. The problem with Skyfall is that Mendes has come to Bond as a viewer, maybe a fan, but not a director. He has produced a modern action film that takes elements of what he likes, but has utterly failed to churn out a Bond film.It was rather strangely paced, and we know it was ""fucked"" by the writers strike, but Quantum of Solace was every inch 007. The very euro chic of an opera used as a backdrop to a perverted auction, the henchmen having just as much character as the villain, Bond following leads with varying success etc. And the presence of a fallen woman who isn't trying to be his mother.Skyfall had all the elements in position at the start, but started to trade them away for gems from other films. A villain who thought he was the Joker, and in an Avengers plot. Hacking shenanigans from Die Hard, an ending from Home Alone. Even the classic pay off from someone using Dredd's Lawgiver.The various plot holes which have been very well aired elsewhere were ultimately a product of losing focus because of so much borrowing. Mendes needs to stop being a fan, and become a director again. Apart from the lazy one note performance from Naomie Harris, there is no reason to assume Mendes cannot use his undoubted skills to work on a piece that fulfils the genre as well as innovates where it is required.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Underwhelmed - (00)7/10,"I went to see this film with a totally open mind hoping to get blown away by it. Sadly, this did not happen. After an exciting opening sequence, the movie sagged badly, with little action either, until the half way mark when the baddie Javier Bardem appeared. He was great, in fact the only great thing about the film. The film may have been well made, and well shot, but I found it bleak and tiresome, and worst of all just not very exciting or suspenseful. I am bored with seeing it raining in London, this is a tired cliché, London is not such a rainy city ! The Shanghai scenes were boring and unimaginative, I only saw the film 2 hours ago and I am struggling to remember what happened there ! The casino fight was quite pathetic and absurdly resolved. The mystery island segment showed imagination and was better.The film was full of decent half-laughs and sniggers, but no real killer lines. I am not at all a fan of mindless bombastic action films, but honestly I would be happier to have even John Woo or Michael Bay direct the next Bond movie than see more of this ! Give me flash cars, massive action stunts etc. The romantic scenes with the bond girls were also far too understated to the point of being inane, cutting away before there was barely a kiss. This must rank as the un-sexiest bond movie ever !There was not enough action in this film, and I can't believe it cost $ 200 million, where did it all go ? Although the critics reviews are all very positive at the moment, I am sure that when the hype dies down this movie will have no higher a rating than Quantum of Solace in the long run. In fact, though Q of S is not a film I long to see again, I enjoyed it more at the cinema than I did this ! I give Skyfall a very disappointed (00)7/10, and that is being generous !",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Empowered by an Excellent Foil, Daniel Craig Finally Strikes a Chord","A solid return to form for the Bond franchise after a bit of instability in Quantum of Solace. Daniel Craig is still growing into the leading role, but he's begun to mix in little quirks and kinks to his performance that, taken together, make a big difference. The action sets, also, seem to be past their growing pains and strike a nice balance between the stark, modern realism of the two preceding pictures and the characteristic over-the-top absurdity of past chapters. Like its predecessors Skyfall struggles with pacing issues, dilly-dallying for most of the first act, but once Javier Bardem finally surfaces around the sixty-minute mark it gets to the point and presses pedal to metal the rest of the way. It's interesting that, while in previous films the villains have been momentary flashes of color meant to shine a brighter light on the hero, Bardem's role in Skyfall often actually eclipses that of Bond himself. He's a brilliant, charismatic, damaged bit of anarchy that's reminiscent of, if not quite as eccentric as, Heath Ledger's turn as the Joker, and Bardem is magnificently unnerving in the role. With the spirited new foil, the return of a few familiar monikers to the series and a dramatic, meaningful finale that's sure to reverberate through subsequent installments, I think it's safe to say James Bond is finally, firmly back in the saddle.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Daniel Craig is back as Bond in Skyfall,"The James Bond franchise has had some ups and downs but somehow has stayed going strong over the years. When Daniel Craig took over the role of Bond it sent a shockwave through the fans heart as he delivered a harder edged Bond than ever seen before. Casino Royale knocked it out of the park, but while Quantum of Solace was OK it just didn't live up to the quality of Casino Royale. After much struggle to get the latest Craig Bond film Skyfall made it's finally here, but will it return to what made Royale so good or will it be another sequel like Solace?Skyfall follows Bond as his loyalty to M is tested when her past comes back to haunt her. With an attack on MI6 and a threat that is becoming more personal, 007 must come back from the dead to save her and MI6 before all is lost, no matter how personal it gets. This is easily the best Craig Bond film to date and could rank as one of the best of the 007 overall. Here we get a more emotional Bond times, but not in the realm of whiny or preachy like a lot of stories like this go. While there are some major action sequences, they are noticeably toned down for this latest edition to the popular franchise in favor of taking a more personal approach for both Bong and M, who is given a lot more to do here. Craig steps back into the shows of the titular spy better than ever continuing to breathe new life into this old school spy hero. Dame Judi Dench steps up her game even more to take the M character in a whole new direction giving her a chance to showcase even more of her acting brilliance. Of all the great performances none rival that of Javier Bardem who is the perfect villain. He is a bit over the top strange at times which gives him the feel of the classic villains in the earlier Bond films. Do not be surprised if he ends up with another Oscar nod for this character. The action that is in this film delivers on every level really keeping you the edge of your seat and racking up the body count.Skyfall more than makes up for the issues with Quantum of Solace and even improves on what made Casino Royale so great. In addition to the expected current look and feel of the series, this time around they have added some classic elements that will make any hardcore Bond fan smile taking this film into a whole new level. If there were any doubts about his staying power it will easily be dispelled with Skyfall as Daniel Craig is James Bond and cannot wait to see what they have in store next.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Skyfall, Easily on the best Bond films","Casino Royale was one of the best Bond film, whilst Quantum of Solace was frustratingly flawed. Now we have have Skyfall, the third outing of Daniel Craig as Bond, with Sam Mendes stepping into the directors chair.After the horrible opening to Quantum of Solice (a lesson in bad editing). Skyfall opens with an extremely strong action packed opening sequence, which introduces a new major character and also is the basis for the main plot of the film. The following title sequence, is exceptionally well done and whilst I am not a big fan of Adele's Skyfall opening theme, it does work well with the titles.I won't go into any further detail on the story but it is handled well through out. Certain comparisons have been made with Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' and I can definitely see resemblances, though I think the dynamic between the characters in Skyfall is stronger and more interesting.Whilst the story for the film is quite basic, it is written extremely well for the most part. The dialogue is probably at a higher level than I have heard in a Bond film for many years and maybe ever. Sam Mendes is generally accepted as being a actors director and he shows his skill here, bringing out some great performances.Daniel Craig has made the role of Bond his own and for me is probably the best Bond. In this film we see a much changed, more grown up Bond, who is much more world weary than previous Bonds and who is shown to have various problems. Judy Dench as we expect is impressive as 'M' and with the story of the film, revolving firmly around her character, she is given much more to do than any previous Bond film.As for incoming Characters. Javier Bardem is a strong Bond villain, who come across as extremely creepy at times and camp at others. Naomie Harris works well as the field agent 'Eve' and her character and Bond work well off each other. Bérénice Marlohe does a good job in her role but isn't given a huge amount to do, Ben Whishaw plays a modern version of 'Q', he is given quite a bit to work with and again his interaction with Bond helps the film. Ralph Fiennes comes in to the film with a very murky character, who is fleshed out through out the film. It does become quite obvious where his character is heading, though those of us with a suspicion double cross nature might come to an in obvious but incorrect assumption.Mise-en-scène in a Bond films are exceptionally good generally but with Skyfall the notch is moved up another level. The settings for the film look extraordinary adding a huge amount of character to the film. Special mention has to be given to Roger Deakins, who does an amazing job of the cinematography and if this is not up for an Academy Award for the amazing job he has done on the film, it would be a travesty.Another area where Skyfall has stepped up its game is the score, which I found both comforting and interesting. Thomas Newman has taken over from David Arnold and has done a great job. As I said at the top, I am not a big fan of Adele's Bond theme but it does make much more sense after seeing the film.Unfortunately I can't say the film is perfect. There are a couple of moments, which for me don't work as well as they should. The initial interaction between Bond and Bardem's Raoul Silva, at a certain point becomes uncomfortable, in not a great way. Fortunately that moment psses soon enough but it will raise eyebrows.My second gripe is the ending.I found it to be much weaker than I had hoped for. It isn't terrible but is very sudden and feels out of step compared to the rest of the film.Apart from the two small problems though I feel that Skyfall, in Bonds 50th year is a triumph. I would say that this Bond film probably isn't for kids as it has some strong moments, though none stronger than the Chair scene in Casino Royale. Well worth going to see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond.com,"Skyfall. An interesting title, yet very fitting once you reach the end. The film opens with a stunning action scene. In fact, it's so stunning that I believe it isn't surpassed throughout the rest of the film. The climax is cool, but it really isn't anything we haven't seen in other action movies. The story is pretty well done. It's really a tale about a strained relationship between Bond and His boss M. There's also a new villain. Javier Bardem's Silva was good, not great. He was certainly better than the last Bond villain. I felt he was a little too much like the Joker from The Dark Knight. I tried to shake the feeling but it kept coming up, especially when he actually does a couple of things exactly like him. Don't get me wrong though, he is a good villain despite some flaws. Daniel Craig was also good. He played the part of an older, more vulnerable bond. It was a good comeback story of sorts. He did some awesome stuff. A scene on train and a chase on an elevator had me in disbelief, in a good way. You won't be disappointed if you're coming for action. One disappointing aspect was the ""Bond Girls"". I thought they were kind of shoe-horned in just because. They didn't add much. Bond's chemistry with Eve was non-existent. Casino Royale was much better at being believable in that department. I also noticed a lot of one-liners from all the characters. Many of them fell flat, one in particular ""Welcome to Scotland"" didn't draw a single laugh from the crowd. It was a minor problem, but it did distract some from the serous tone. In the end though this is still a great film. Thank heavens it was miles better than Quantum of Solace. In my opinion it wasn't the best bond ever, but still one of the best. See it.tkubas1.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
An Absolute Epic,"Perhaps the most somber moment of Skyfall is when the credits begin rolling and you realize that the film has presented a potentially unstoppable, untouchable, superior story to the modern Bond franchise. Mendes joins the ranks of Rian Johnson, Jon Favreau, and Marc Webb in his first action film attempt. Fortunately for the viewer and Bond franchise fan-boys, Mendes succeeds with flying royal colors. Mendes' cinematography coincide with the best Bond character performances in series' history. Amid Daniel Craig's most convincing Bond performance yet and Bardem's chilling villain play, Dench, Fiennes and others give an fantastic emotional flair rarely seen in past action epics. In the end, Skyfall merges old bond with new bond in such unbelievable fashion, that Skyfall has made itself a mandatory keystone in the famous British series. An absolute must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
one of the best in the series,"so, i went and saw skyfall yesterday, and i came to one conclusion. this is one of the best in the series. this one really does good to the style of bond, which in my opinion is what made the bond movies so good. i have grown up with the james bond movies, and have seen all of them many times. casino royal was OK, but i was so very disappointing with quantum of solice. quantum didn't feel like a bond movie, and it also wasn't written very good. skyfall brings back his old school corny one liners, and just everything about it felt like a bond movie. in my opinion goldfinger is still my all time favorite, but skyfall is right up there with it. so, if you are a fan of the old james bond, and you haven't seen skyfall yet, you are missing out everyday you aren't going to see it. i hope my review is good enough, and hope it helps.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best in Craig's List So Far,"A former agent with a personal vendetta against M goes postal against MI6. It seems this franchise has undergone a number of reboots in the last couple of decades in attempts to stay relevant half a century after it was launched. Some of the changes make no sense, seeming to have been implemented in a vacuum, ignoring the preceding films. Other than long- term changes, this one is more low-tech than recent entries in this series, and this is a refreshing change. The final showdown between Bond and the villain takes place at an isolated mansion, and is a throwback to an old-fashioned action movie. In his third outing, Craig appears to be becoming more comfortable as 007. Bardem makes an amusing if goofy villain.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Skyfall has the best Bond villain and a Western vibe to it,"¨ It always makes me feel a bit melancholy. Grand old war ship. being ignominiously haunted away to scrap... The inevitability of time, don't you think? What do you see? ¨¨James Bond will return¨ is one of the few promises that have never been broken, and that is where Skyfall jumps in as the 23rd film of the franchise. There have been several changes along the way, this is the third film Daniel Craig stars as the main character, but it is the first time Sam Mendes (American Beauty and Road to Perdition) directs. Long time screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade are back again writing the script although this time John Logan (Gladiator, Hugo) was brought on board to help out. I think these new additions improved the film and gave the characters a lot more depth. This is a very different James Bond film; it begins as your average spy thriller with a motorcycle chase but ends like a Western film with a final shoot out in an open field. Skyfall is beautifully shot by cinematographer Roger Deakins who should receive his tenth Oscar nomination for his work in this film. The film has a much more artistic feeling to it than most other blockbuster Bond movies and much credit has to be given to all these new additions. The film has a nostalgic feeling to it as we finally begin to see how the inevitability of time can catch up to even the greatest spy on Earth. Like we saw in the Dark Knight Rises with Batman, James Bond too has begun to feel the weight of time over his shoulders and he is much more vulnerable in this picture. Sam Mendes also does another thing very well in this film: he pays homage to some of the earlier Bond films near the end. Skyfall was a great film and definitely among the best Bond movies. However I would still rank Casino Royale as the best one so far.Unlike with Quantum of Solace that picked up right where Casino Royale left out, Skyfall takes place several years later as we see an aged Bond (Daniel Craig) chasing yet another foe who has stolen a computer drive which contains all the names of the MI6 British agents and their locations. Bond is not on his own; his partner Eve (Naomie Harris) is also following the evasive man who is getting away with the drive. Bond chases him to the top of the train and Eve is waiting for the perfect moment to take the shot but time is running out. M (Judi Dench) orders Eve to take the shot before they get out of her reach and the bullet hits Bond. The man disappears with the drive, and Bond is declared death after he falls wounded into a river. A few months go by and M is in trouble for having lost the drive and putting all the MI6 agents in harm way. Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) insists it is her moment to retire, but she refuses since she wants to solve the problem. An explosion takes place inside the headquarters and several other agents die. M receives a threat claiming that the name of 5 agents will be revealed and that she should pay for her sins. Bond, who of course hasn't been dead but enjoying of his early retirement decides to return to England after hearing about the explosion and enlists once again as 007, although a bit more rusty. M sends him on a mission to find the man who has the drive and retrieve it before more harm is done. Here we are introduced to some other characters like Q (Ben Whishaw), Severine (Berenice Marlohe), and Silva (Javier Bardem) and the spy games begin.I must say that Javier Bardem portrays one of the best Bond villains I've seen. He steals the show from the minute he walks in. I think another Oscar nomination is on the way for his supporting performance here. It is a villain unlike most other ones. Silva is seeking revenge but in a much more calculated and methodic way. Skyfall is much better thanks to him. Daniel Craig is in my opinion the best Bond and he had a lot more depth in this film as well. The Bond girls were also perfectly cast. You can't have a Bond film without them. Berenice Marlohe and Naomie Harris were both great in their roles. Judi Dench is marvelous as M. She has been playing this role for nearly two decades and here we see her making a lot more difficult decisions. She is portrayed in a much darker light here. The film works extremely well, I loved the new characters, the nostalgic feeling to the film, and the beautiful cinematography. This is a different kind of Bond film, but one you will want to see.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Good movie, classic Bond maybe","I've never been a big fan of certain franchises that people love. Lord Of The Rings, Star Wars, and James Bond come to mind. While I respect and give praise to all 3 I just don't quite understand the love. Probably because I've never seen most of them and when i do the hype makes my expectations too high. Ironically I've seen every single Daniel Craig Bond movie and my enjoyment is also mixed. While Casino Royale is a fantastic movie, it left me cold. It's me not you principal. This is along the lines of Casino Royale and while it's always tempting to compare the two, i'd say they're at the same level. Skyfall is bigger and more personal, Casino Royale is tighter and more specific. That being said Skyfall also left me cold. I can't help but think that if i had went in with no expectations i would've loved it more. But once again that's my fault not the movies.The good. WOW. this is what I want to see in a james bond movie. Developed Characters, amazing action, great acting, solid script, two interesting bond girls, etc. Every praise this movie gets is earned in spades. The stuff I loved was the aesthetic. This is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. Jaw Dropping this is definitely something on blu ray. Also this is a very smart movie. For people who just want action it's there and for people who want drama there you have it. Also Daniel Craig, who always delivers as bond, knocks it out of the park. 2012 was definitely the year for action movies this Django, Avengers, and TDKR all having incredible set pieces.The negative, and once again this will not have an effect on my overall opinion this is just me, Too long. I had the same problem with Casino so i don't know if it's me, but honestly I didn't notice the running time until this movie. The pacing is good in the first half but as the movie goes on there is a little drag going on. I didn't mention Javier Bardem in my positives. This year is also the year for underusing or undermining Best Supporting Actor performances in the third act of the movie. This , Prometheus, Django, Seven Psychopaths, The Dark Knight Rises, all great performances that totally don't get utilized. He's a revelation. He's incredible it's ridicicolous how amazing his intro into this movie is. But as it goes on he becomes less interesting. They even have his face covered up so he doesn't get to emote that well. Still an amazing performance I hope they keep going with this direction of villains.Great movie, not in the slightest overrated and will definitely get better with repeat viewings. The flaws are there if you look for them , but other then those people, and idiots like myself, everybody else will fall in love with this movieAfter re-watching the movie , most of the flaws I saw where fixed and it completely lives up to the hype, except for the ending which is still a tad anti-climatic , and some plot strands unanswered, but still great movie I do have to say this is the best Daniel Craig bond movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"50 Years, but Still never gets old.","I am not a huge James Bond person, in fact I've only seen a few Bond movies. However, I must say they are a work of art. The characters and storyline must have required a lot of thought. Huge movie legacies like this or The Godfather never gets old or played out. And as I said before, Skyfall is a work of art. Unfortunaly, I cannot say that about many movies. Honestly, very few films deserve the honor (in my opinion) of being call ""art"". The thing that made Skyfall good was not the action or the suspense, although that was good as well. It was the simple fact that it keep the 50 year old name of James Bond alive. You didn't see all those unnecessary changes and mix ups, like some directors like to do. That I think made this move a good one to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Finally ... Bond has come back to ... the cinema screens,"Don't get overexcited. Yes I know Daniel Craig has done a couple of other movies. But first of all, the waiting time between two Bond movies was a very long one this time around (around 5 years) and the waiting time for the real Bond was even longer. You could also write a summary line that goes: Will the real Bond please stand up? Apart from current or a bit older catch phrases from music or TV (wrestling), let's get back to what is essential. Just like the movie does. I understand that some people did not like what the movie did. But to celebrate the 50th birthday of Bond there could not have been a better movie (ok there always can be a better movie, but it's a pretty good one right here). I'm not going to reveal any plot points or other significant things that will be more than a treat for Bond lovers. There are so many gems in this one, but without forgetting to make it about a really good story.Daniel Craig must have finally arrived ... at least for most of the fans. Hopefully you can finally enjoy a Bond movie too, even if you didn't until now.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Average Action studded Pseudo Bond Film.,"Nothing original. Not written by Ian Fleming. The persona of Mr. Daniel Craig does not fit into the character created originally by Ian Fleming. The story revolved around an insider job, executed by an ex-M16 agent. Own M16 British secret agent revolting against his department Head. Too much action, too much flaws like M (MoneyPenny) ordering to fire, even when the girl on the trigger apprehends James Bond may be hit, who was engaged in a hand to hand scuffle with the bad guy. Strange orders of M, executed ruthlessly that result in shooting their own secret agent. Afterwards, lame excuses put by M (Judi). Too weak a story. I logically suppose such decrepit orders of an incompetent M, should be enough to perturb James Bond to join hands with Silvo.Too much crazy action, too weak script, unimpressive Bond girls and a young feeble and immature Q. His persona was quite much a mockery of the character Q, that was originally defined by Ian Fleming. Finally, Daniel Craig has a cold, insipid and stolid visage. His physiognomy does not represent or portray the exact tall, suave and femme fa-tale demeanor consummately sported by Sean Connery and Roger Moore.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best Bond Ever? Movie Fans 'Yes' Bond Fans 'No!',"So hands up who honestly thought 'Skyfall' would be the must see blockbuster of 2012, No? Well it seems certain to be not only the highlight of this year at the multiplex but also Movie enthusiasts favourite ever Bond, However bond devotees may not be convinced. As 002 Roger Moore once said ""It's sort of like a bedtime story: As long as you don't go too far away from the original, the child is happy,"" So Sam Mendes and the crews balancing act has to be commended, moving away from the traditional bond formula whilst also staying in range of the double O radar is a tricky business. The epic intro full of action that's more like the end of a film, the irrelevant MacGuffin (No Nuclear Armageddon this time its Hacking and Hard-drives - hmmm very modern) the one-liners and the Aston Martin are all here, however the glamorous exotic locations are swapped for London. A nice touch in this Olympic year.Indeed at times it feels similar to the opening ceremony's celebration of British culture not only in heavyweight acting talent (Fiennes is fantastic with limited screen time he manages to change are view of him with every new appearance) but there are also nods to the poetry of Tennyson and the art of JWM Turner not to mention Adele's more traditional theme song. Thankfully this spirit doesn't extend to giving John Cleese another bash at Q instead the subtler more pivotal role is given to Pingu from 'Nathan Barley' (Ben Whishaw). Who along with at least 3 others give fine performances and should be expecting a return for Bond 24.The person we should most of all be hoping gets on board for the next mission is Cinematographer Roger Deakins. Whose involvement makes this the most beautifully shot Bond by some distance. The first act as expected is full of intrigue and a bit of a slow burner (It is over an hour in before main baddie Bardem's first appearance) but the stunning visuals ensure you won't want to take your eyes off the screen for a second. If he and Mendes were to stay we could be in for the kind of sustained reboot we were promised at the beginning of the Craig era.Without giving to much of the plot away expanding the role of M is something precisely none of us were asking for but it is however a master-stoke. Having are hero's damsel in distress being a vulnerable 70 odd-year-old rather than the usual bikini clad babe adds a lot more freshness than it has any right to. It is this sort of minor tweaking that 'Skyfall' does so well. If I had to find a criticism I must admit after 'No Country for Old Men' I was expecting something very special from Javier Bardem (Don't get me wrong he is the best nemesis in a long long time). I think had Bardem been given just as big a part but as a second in command henchman/enforced type we could have had a character as iconic to the franchise as perhaps Oddjob or Jaws. That aside we are left with a Bond film to be enthusiastically enjoyed an absolute must see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Horribly Disappointed. Skyfall???? I call it Skyfail.,"Lets start from the beginning. Pre credits scene is shot in turkey. Bond is chasing a guy who has stolen a drive containing information about undercover agents.OK, not bad. Yes, its full of action but end result, bond gets shot and falls into some river. Credits time, adele's song.... Not sexy, but fits the movie perfectly. The animation is Bad. Next, bond is alive....How? The movie doesn't say how!!! Oh god, kill me!! Bond enjoys death, meanwhile MI6 is under attack, cyber terrorists, we are led believe, caused the attack. This, is when it starts to become very boring. Cyber terrorism? Very common if you ask me, this is nothing special or extra ordinary. You've seen it before.. Die hard 4.0 for example. I suggest you watch that if you ask me to choose between skyfall and die hard 4. OK fine, cyber terrorism accepted, At least show us how destructive it can be how its going to be a big threat . But no, nothing of that sort is shown. Next, there is absolutely no motive for the villain. He harvests computers in his hideout, for what? Just so that he can keep a track on MI6. Yes, its a horrible plot. The first time i said 'Woah!' in the movie was during the house siege. That was really cool no doubt. It was impressive. The climax wasn't that bad as well. Performances- Craig was good. Judi Dench and Barden did justice too. Bottom line is that a weak plot and MORE IMPORTANTLY, very few action sequences spoil Skyfall or is it Skfail?!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Oscar should prefer Daniel Craig as Bond as opposed to Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln,"Though I have enjoyed adventure/mystery flicks over the years, I have never previously seen an entire James Bond movie. As a child, I would catch glimpses of old Bond movies on television, and I always found the dialogue to be trite and boring, prompting me to change the channel. But now comes 2012 and the draw of the chiseled, serious-minded, Daniel Craig, drew me to finally watch a Bond movie. I took my 70 year old father, who enjoyed the movie, but afterward quipped that ""Sean Connery was a better looking James Bond."" I have not watched Connery as Bond, but Daniel Craig sizzles with sexiness as this dark blonde, brooding, dangerous, unsmiling, elegant agent. Setting aside the sultry energy that this actor emits on screen (something that I do not believe any modern day actor equals; Craig's smouldering affect is akin to Cary Grant in North by Northwest or Brando in On the Waterfront), the plot of this movie is fast-paced, energetic, and overall entertaining. Craig's moving performance is corroborated by the assistance of being surrounded by great actors, such as Dench and Bardiem. And, of course, Bardeim's villain matches his equally demonically dark presence of his character in No Country for Old Men. The Skyfall script is tight, unpredictable, and the cinematography is nothing less than stunning (and no, I am not talking about the scenes of a shirtless Bond - though Craig is as visually beautiful as the Scottish landscape).I have not been so entertained by a movie in many years. I am actually going to see this one again next weekend and, while I made repeat trips to the theater to see Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark as a child, I have not made a repeat visit to a movie theater in adulthood.In closing, Daniel Craig should get an Oscar nod for this movie. I am tired of hearing about the ""brilliant"" acting of Daniel Day Lewis in Lincoln and the ""brilliance"" of Spielberg. Lincoln was a mediocre movie at best, and this is coming from a person who resides in the Land of Lincoln and who is a Civil War buff (Ridley Scott's Gettysburg is one of my favorite movies). Spielberg has not made a great movie since Schindler's List and, while DDL was indeed ""brilliant"" in My Left Foot and There Will Be Blood, his performance in Lincoln is hampered by a silly, exaggerated, sophomoric, Joey-the-horse type, of script.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bo(r)nd Again!,"2012 marks the 50th anniversary of 'Dr. No', the film which first marked the appearance of the iconic MI6 agent James Bond. Six actors and 23 films later, Bond still remains a cultural icon across the world and from Connery to Craig, almost every film has been a treat to watch.So does Sam Mendes''Skyfall' fall in that category? Hell yes it does! And it successfully wipes our memory of the disappointing 'Quantum Of Solace' which I was sincerely hoping was not the last appearance of Bond due to MGM's troubles that followed.The film begins with a thrilling chase sequence in Istanbul (which, I believe has been shot to death in action films this year after 'Taken 2' and 'Ek Tha Tiger') which involves Bond (Daniel Craig) and field agent Eve (Naomie Harris)in pursuit of a mercenary who has stolen a hard drive which contains the information on undercover MI6 agents. When an accident following a fight upon a train happens, Bond is presumed to be dead. Soon after, M (Dame Judi Dench) is politely asked to retire by the Intelligence Committee chairman, Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes). However, M is forced to confront her past after an attack on the MI6 headquarters in London brings Bond back in action. What follows after is a roller coaster ride of a film,anything of which to be given away would be a crime.Speaking of the cast, Daniel Craig and Judi Dench are top-notch and have possibly given their best shot at it as their respective characters. Naomie Harris and Ralph Fiennes do their jobs adequately. Another wonderful addition to the cast is Ben Whishaw, who portrays 'Q' in a rather different and an interesting way than what we have seen of the character in previous films. But the standout performer who steals (rather,sweeps!) the film away is Javier Bardem as the film's main antagonist, the cyberterrorist Silva. He is perfect in every scene, perfectly creepy, perfectly menacing, never under or overdoing anything. In fact, I'll go as far as to say that his performance is worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Heath Ledger's Joker in 'The Dark Knight'.Technically, this is a flawless film with every action sequence making it worth a re-watch. The score is astounding and Adele's 'Let the Sky Fall' from the opening credits sequence is very easy on the ears. Also, this one has possibly the best opening credits sequence in Bond history from a visual perspective.But the film has it's flaws as well,minor, but flaws nevertheless. The final act is somewhat underwhelming and does not match the awesomeness of the first two. Fans of the Roger Moore/Sean Connery era may not like the film, because there aren't really many scenes involving quintessential Bond elements. However,Mendes does make sure to feature those along with presenting a gritty, realistic 007. This film is probably the first one to touch upon Bond's past and how he came to be. More importantly, it addresses the question 'Is James Bond relevant in today's age, or is he a relic of the past?' Find that out for yourself. Do NOT miss 'Skyfall'!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Is it a James Bond or a Batman??,"In light of the Cold War the James Bond movies used to be a means to tell people: ""Don't take war too seriously!"" It was a way to convert the threat , presented by the Soviet Union, into amusement. The stylistic devices, to achieve that, have been a certain amount of British humor, Bond girls and exciting gadgets. Do not expect too much of either in Skyfall!In fact, it appears as though the makers desperately tried to diminish anything that used to stand for James Bond, and in turn, tried to increase anything that has to do with the contemporary Batman trilogy. Although performed fairly well, Silva (played by Javier Bardem) reminded me of a poor version of Joker in the Dark Knight. Moreover, the mood, conveyed in the movie is strikingly similar to the one in the Batman trilogy. Even the plot shows similarities; which, I will not reveal, of course. Last but not least it is worth to mention that the action is mediocre compared to movies like the Bourne trilogy, for instance.Nevertheless; although I did not leave the movies with an uplifted feeling, it is still a pretty watchable movie.

Finale of the Beginning of THE BOND,"Bond is back. The First Stunt Sequence is Outstanding comparing to the final ""SKYFALL"" sequences. STORY: Nothing. At last after so much technical build up, they ended it like a normal revenge movie. In this edition, Daniel Craig is much adapted to the Bond Character & style than the other two movies. Good looking Bond girls; Gorgeous Locations; Classic Cars; Stunning Stunts; Witty One Liners - Everything were there which we usually expect from Bond Movies (which we miss from other two movies). I think the Director had the confusion where to use the Bond Theme and as usual he wasted it by misplacing. Negatives: The movie is slow paced and the overall movie is lengthy.

Are you people for real,"Went to see the movie in imax. After the end of the movie i realised this is one among the worst bond movies i have ever seen. The opening song was good visually i would say. No storyline continuation. Where is the hard drive ?? Where are the gadgets, women and style you see in all bond movies. Where do you get all these raving reviews. If you are true bond lover, this movie is a shame to bonds legacy. I would wait until all these fake proud reviewers have praised bond enough. Its just like another taken 2 movie. M and her love for her work is the only positive i see in this movie. Bond is just not bond enough in this movie. Someone directing the next bond movie please give a serious thought to what all the previous bond movies had in them.

Skyfall: Best James Bond Movie I watched in Series of 50 years,"Skyfall, I watched the movie in the cinema before. It was outstanding. Everything, from the song sang by Adele, Skyfall, the choice of different locations to film the movie, the effects from camera and video shots in the movie, are perfectly matched to produce a successful movie, which is capable of winning at least a Oscar award for one of its components. Moreover, the storyline is unique and sensational. The title of the movie, the song sang by Adele with a mysterious tone, the name being mentioned by a character and the fictitious place where James Bond was born and raised as a adapted child by his adapted parents after his biological parents died, all of these are linked to the purpose of the personal self of James Bond's identity with his fictitious enemy, Silva. In the end, as usual, James Bond and the Bond Girls are still the iconic figures of the 50 year series who fight off bad guys and the license to kill them whenever they feel it is justice to do it. Skyfall, the best James Bond Movie I ever watched in the 50 year series!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Skyfall is madly entertaining,"Daniel Craig makes his return as the iconic action hero James Bond in this compelling installment directed by Sam Mendes this time around. James Bond is assigned on a mission in which quickly goes wrong when he is shot down and wounded. Things eventually get worst when MIG is attacked by terrorists lead by computer hacker Raoul Silva (played by Javier Bardem who's intent on killing M (played by Judi Dench) who he once knew before she betrayed him. With MI6 occupied and M's leadership becoming questionable, Agent Bond seeks through the shadows to find help from field agent Eve Moneypenny (played by Naomie Harris) to hunt down Silva and take him down once and for all. Complete with electrifying action sequences, astounding plot, and phenomenal James Bond material, Skyfall stands what maybe the James Bond flick yet.This movie was a tense thrill ride from start to finish, and the opening action scene taking place on the high speed train really sets the tone of the film. The action scenes serve astoundingly well in this film, and this greatly done by the solid cinematography by Roger Deakins; definitely something Oscar-worthy. When the action lets down, viewers are introduced to some interesting characters including the main villain Raoul Silva who's sinister identity is fueled by a strong performance by Javier Bardem who made an impressive portrayal as a villain in Joel and Ethan Coen's 'No Country for Old Men' in 2007. Then there is the main protagonist James Bond who remains as charismatic and enthralling as ever, and Daniel Craig's performance certainly gives credit for this. The film also presents some eye-catchy action set pieces, one of which is set on Hashima Island, an uninhabited island south of Nagasaki, Japan, where buildings are rusty and completely rundown in a war-torn like setting.Skyfall is a highly entertaining action film and definitely deserves the praise it gets. This film shows that Daniel Craig still has the James Bond energy in him and is a perfect fit for the iconic British spy. All in all, Skyfall is a must-watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Return to Great Storytelling,"This third installment of the Daniel Craig contribution to the James Bond franchise makes for a great movie experience. Its immediate predecessor, ""Quantum of Solace"" was a bit week in the storytelling department. That's not the case with ""Skyfall"". Here we have a great movie with an engaging script and good pacing. The characterization works well, with Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes making major contributions to the film. A new Q is introduced as well, and Javier Bardem makes for a spectacular Bond villain.My lone criticism of this movie is that there was less of the dramatic action sequences that serve as the standard formula for a 007 movie. ""Casino Royale"" hit the perfect balance of action vs. storytelling, while ""Quantum"" was heavy on the scenic action scenes without much regard for the script. ""Skyfall"" gets the storytelling done in a superb fashion, and the film certainly does have action scenes--but there's no boat chase or ski slope drama the likes of which comes to mind as the standard formula for a Bond movie. The exception to this is the opening train scene, which is well done and clever, but it was just slightly disappointing not to see more of that style of scene in the movie.I will note that the first time I watched this movie, I saw it with two children and they found it hard to keep up, which was a disappointment for me since I loved my first Timothy Dalton 007 movie as a kid. It's that lack of action scenes that may make this harder to enjoy for a young audience.That being the case, I've given this film 9/10 stars. It's close to perfect, but just a tad bit off of the mark set by ""Casino Royale"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Chicken Little was Right,"Bond is back... both literally and figuratively. The first two Daniel Craig era Bond films took the franchise in a distinctly different direction. They were both good movies but somehow weren't fully Bond. Craig's Bond is a new Bond for a new age; tougher, edgier, and more serious. Bond had lost some of his charm and pretty much all of his sense of fun. Going into Skyfall I was resigned that my and my father's Bond was completely gone. It was a pleasant surprise to see I was wrong.Skyfalll hits the sweet-spot between Octopussy and Casino Royale. It preserves the energy and grittiness of the new Bond but brings back just enough of the old Bond's levity to remind the audience that Bond is supposed to be fun.Beyond the solid script and heart stopping action, Skyfall is far and away the most visually striking Bond movie yet. Whoever is is doing the location scouting and production design also deserves special recognition. Skyfall is the perfect way to celebrate 50 years of Bond. It pays homage to the storied history of 007 while pioneering a new trail for Bond to venture for years to come.Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars... and this has been The Mack Minute.

An all-around winner... except for the script,"It is a pleasure to eventually watch a Bond movie that is not just a quick and dirty actioneer. Especially since the franchise, in its Daniel Craig days, had clearly accepted the Greengrass/Bourne way to shoot action as a basic requirement. All-out action is still here but the other scenes are not just rushed intermezzi. Efficiency is not the only thing that matters here as opposed to the 22 previous instalments.The villain is good. The character is perfectly tailored and brilliantly flesh out by Javier Bardem, but then the script forgets to build an engaging story around him. OK we didn't need a 23rd variation on a plot to rule the World, and it was an interesting idea to have the villain hunt down 007 instead of the usual formula with Bond sneaking inside the villain's base. But this should have been a -suspenseful- beginning, this cannot be a climactic ending.Anyway Craig's Bond really shifts the paradigm. He is a somber agent only enjoying high life and hot gals in between brooding phases. Before Craig 007 was a comics hero, then they wanted to make him more human (the original Casino Royale story more or less implied this), for fear of wearing out the audience expectations after so many sequels, copycats and - worst of all - spoofs. Having grown up with the lighter-hearted Connery and Moore versions it is difficult to feel the same buoyant enthusiasm. Allegedly Licence to kill was a flop because James Bond had suddenly become a violent machine with hardly a sense of humour. Then Brosnan was the silliest of all. Skyfall goes so far as reaching for the hero's youth backstory. Let's say there's a backstory but we don't want to watch 007 with a shrink. Digging up backstories is really a lazy screenwriter's hack job.Fortunately images and action are both great in the last part, but then you feel you was given the wrong medicine. This could have been the setting for a Living dead or Vampire movie shootout, but this bucolic/pyrotechnic ending really doesn't feel like a Bond movie Third Act.So, I can appreciated the different Bond as played by Daniel Craig and I certainly appreciated to watch 007 move around in a more polished product, but I still need some real creative story to be told around these. Is the franchise turning into a series? Including some surprise at the end of the season? Some can't wait to watch Bond 24, not me. My expectations were quite low for Skyfall and I was able to enjoy it despite its flaw, but now I am suspicious, I am expecting them to reproduce only the less good parts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Business And Pleasure,"Skyfall was really a perfect storm for a Bond film. You have one of the best theme songs in the series' history with Adele's Skyfall, strong female characters led by the expanded presence of Judi Dench's M, and one of the best villains with Javier Bardem's Silva. I may like Casino Royale a little bit more, but it switches on a day to day basis. The important thing is that Skyfall isn't just a great Bond film, it's a great film.Right from the electrifying opening pre credits sequence it's clear we are in for a ride. It's also clear that this film will focus on M and Bond's relationship which has been so well documented in this series of films. I love that M tells Naomie Harris as Moneypenny/Eve to take the shot even though she doesn't have a clear shot. Then seeing her reaction and emotions unfold as she believes Bond to be dead. It's been clear ever since Casino Royale and through his rogue adventures in Quantum that she has a fondness and a soft spot for James. In many ways Skyfall completes the Bond origin story into the Bond we have known throughout the years to be. This film is absolutely a deviation from the typical formulaic process to Bond though. But trust me, it was a good change.Bardem as Silva showed shades of Loki and Joker in that he's always one more step ahead of MI6. He's also going after them instead of them going after him for most of the film, and in particular, he wants M. I genuinely believe Silva belongs up there with the best of the Bond villains. There's just so much emotional undertone mixed with a strange sense of humor that fits so well opposite Bond. To go along with that, I think Skyfall is probably the most emotional Bond film to date. There is a real sense of heart to this movie that most of the other entries don't have.What's more impressive is that there is still the fantastic action that we love from the series to go along with the heart and terrific character writing. This film is definitely not for every Bond fan, in fact I don't think hardcore fans would find this to be as good as the casual fan. Even though I consider myself one of those hardcore fans, I can acknowledge the deviations the film took. For one, Bond doesn't sleep with every flipping lady in the film, and two the villain doesn't have global aspirations. But that's why the film works so well, it's so fresh and exhilarating. Something I hope the franchise continues to be. Wow, and that concludes my 2 month long Bond marathon in preparation for Spectre.

Not only was his performance so action-packed and thrilling, he also gave off a mysterious and unapologetic vibe. The storyline was an inevitable one. Somehow the franchise has to think of a rebellious and big plot that would shake the entire storyline.

"Bond, Lackluster Bond.","""The Bonds are losing their value"" wrote one critic, shortly after the last Sean Connery Bond ""Diamonds are Forever"" hit theaters in 1971. And an old Bond fan might be forgiven for this exact thought on watching ""Skyfall"". When Bond used to mean over-the-top Supervillains in incredibly sophisticated hide-outs, suspense-filled chases in cars, aircraft, boats and even jet-packs, and incredible gadgets, today Bond means... diversity?And make no mistake, the new genders for Bond's side kick and for a major character like ""M"" don't bother me in the slightest. Judy Dench does a fine job as M. And she is every bit as distinguished as Bernard Lee ever was. And Naomi Maxwell (as Eve) makes a fine side-kick to Bond, or at least takes nothing away from the story line.But what DOES take a lot away, is the actual story line... oh where do I even begin? The best Bond films, or films in general, devise a way to grab you from the opening scene - some exciting chase, some absurd situation where Bond is in real peril, SOME THING we haven't seen in other films a hundred times already, was how a Bond film traditionally began.But in ""Skyfall"" nothing the least bit interesting happens until Bardem appears; at which time we get the accustomed monologue from the Super-villain who apropos of nothing, proceeds to explain who he is, what he wants, and why he's doing what he's done. But even that is followed by simply more of the same monotonous story telling that ticks off the boxes on the Super-villain card: Supervillain does something to show how evil he is, then gets captured, and of course makes a seemingly impossible escape. Bond then spends the rest of the movie chasing the supervillain, who Bond eventually destroys in some clever way while making witty quips.But there's a strange lack of suspense in ""Skyfall"". It's far too slow to unravel, is filled with scenes that add nothing to the plot, the story, or character development, and relies too heavily on old cliched tropes. Having Bond's life in danger from an approaching subway train by a locked door is resolved by simply having him shoot the door open. That cliche is older than all of us put together, everybody knows it doesn't work in real life, and using it anyway is a symptom of just how lazy the creators of ""Skyfall"" are throughout the entire 143 minutes this film drags on, and on, and on.I was in no hurry to see this film even when it was new and fresh, and a viewing of this film all the way through takes real effort. The Bond films used to have a pay-off in almost every scene, now the pay-off just never seems to happen. It's a sad thing to watch James Bond die a slow fade of a death as a character but that's what seems to be happening. Watch this film, or don't watch it, it adds nothing to the Bond franchise nor to the world of feature films in general - and if this movie had never been made, no one would have ever noticed. It's just that mediocre a film.The one redeeming quality of the story is Javier Bardem as the heavy. He is a pleasure to watch on screen and his obvious enjoyment of the role is plain to see. But even he can't save this mediocre effort of a Bond film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
An absolute triumph!,"To me, one weakness of the James Bond franchise has always been the detached nature of the timeless character of James Bond (Daniel Craig) to anything from his past. He'd go off on some globetrotting mission to save the world while never having the stakes come anywhere close to where he lived-whether currently or when he was growing up. As such, the character of James Bond always felt like a caricature. An invincible man who always packed his plot armor before jetting off to a tropical paradise to deal with some megalomaniacal genius.I feel Skyfall (2012) is the absolute pinnacle of Bond films because it makes the main character human. The brilliant way Sam Mendes used Javier Bardem as the antithesis to Craig's Bond to highlight how loyalty is a two-way street is such a chef's kiss that I can't even begin to explain how it broke the mold for Bond villains. Visually, Skyfall benefits again from Mendes' vision as a director who already made Academy Award-winning films. Aside from Bardem, the casting of new characters Q (Ben Whishaw) and Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) were welcome additions to the now-established fold of Craig's Bond and Judi Dench's M.While most Bond films stand as their own separate piece of British spy craft, it wasn't until the last moments of this film that I came to realize (with a gasp) that the Daniel Craig movies up to this point in the franchise were merely prequels to established canon. There is certainly some nostalgia for the classic elements from the Sean Connery and Roger Moore eras, but adding in some heavy backstory about Bond's origins placed this movie firmly in modern action territory.The absolute best Bond film, I give Skyfall 5.0 stars out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

James Bond has evolved,"I think many were expecting to see ""explosive pens"", invisible cars, fights in outer space ... Well, that James Bond is dead! And died to birth a Bond more interesting. Today, James Bond returned to being a spy realistic and serious, referring to the good times of Sean Connery (Dr. No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger and Thunderball) and Timothy Dalton (in his two films), moving away from the stereotype created with Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan (Brosnan even gave us entertaining movies, but without any content). Daniel Craig is James Bond like the books by Ian Fleming. It is a believable hero, not limited to sequences and surreal excesses of jokes and nasty beats. And Craig has, in this film, his best performance as 007, well being stronger on paper. Javier Bardem gives life to the best villain of the franchise and the first conversation between Bond and Silva is to devote himself as one of the best moments of the film. In fact, the entire cast is wonderful. The speeches of Q are spectacular, the participation of M is fantastic and Eve gives a more seasoned in history. The strength of the film comes from the able direction of Sam Mendes who knew very well condense action scenes and dialogs. The film is packed with action scenes without a brain. They happen when it is necessary. The final part of ""Skyfall"" is to cause nostalgia to any fan of James Bond. In short: very careful if you want to see this movie! If you watch it expecting a lot of action unnecessary, you will be disappointed greatly. As the Q said in the film, James Bond has evolved!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"A perfectly timed high watermark for the series, 'Skyfall' ups the action, drama, and stakes for Bond to deliver its best entry yet","Fifty years after Bond's first screen outing, 'Skyfall' represents a remarkable high watermark for the series, a truly stunning masterpiece that counts as one of the best, if not the best, Bond films we've seen. It is also so because it is quite unlike any of the Bond films thus far, delving into his origins as well as his relationship with Moneypenny for its most character-driven addition yet. The showy action and authentically British wit are as sharp as ever, but what makes 'Skyfall' stand out is how surprisingly riveting the drama is.Kudos to returning writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, together with Oscar-winning scribe John Logan, who have expertly tapped into today's real-world fears for a tense and thrilling story that spans three continents. Beginning in Istanbul, we are dropped into an operation that's already unfolding – the recovery of a pilfered hard disk drive that contains the names of every single NATO-allied spy embedded in terrorist organisations around the world. Bond is on the chase, paired with fellow agent Eve (Naomie Harris), but predictably it goes south, leaving the disk in the wrong hands and Bond presumed dead by MI6.Then without allowing you to catch your breath following that firecracker of an opening, the MI6 headquarters is rocked by an explosion, and M's computer is hacked into with an ominous message 'think on your sins'. Of course, 'Skyfall' isn't the first to envision a scenario where our once hallowed security institutions are compromised from within, but that nightmarish 'what-if' is depicted so realistically here you can't quite help but feel unnerved.His country and company under attack, Bond returns from seclusion to hunt down the perpetrator, a chase which leads him to Shanghai, then Macau, then a desolate island and finally back to London. Halfway between that globe-trotting manhunt, Bond is finally acquainted with his nemesis, Silva (Javier Bardem). Right from his superb one-take opening where he saunters up to Bond with an extended speech about cannibalistic rats and the inversion of the natural order, Silva proves to be smart, menacing and eerily unpredictable.Unlike the caricatured Bond villains, Silva isn't filled with delusions of grandeur to destroy the world – his purpose is as personal as it gets, involving a bit of nasty history with M, and not unlike that which Bond has to confront himself. 'Skyfall' is the first to allow Judi Dench to flex her acting chops - and the thespian seizes the opportunity to deliver a first-rate performance with dignity and poignancy.It's not just M who needs to confront her demons; for the first time in the franchise's history, its suave and confident character is made to confront his as well. Continuing with his grittier transformation that began with Martin Campbell's notable 'Casino Royale' and subsequently Marc Forster's underwhelming followup 'Quantum of Solace', Bond is here even more human than he has ever been.And yet it is precisely this change that is likely to make Bond an even more convincing hero than he ever was to today's audiences – as Christopher Nolan's 'Batman' saga has shown, it's not nearly enough that our big-screen heroes save the day, we need to know that they can bleed and hurt on the outside as much as inside. Bond's struggle to find conviction, purpose and meaning allows his audience to develop a deep emotional investment with the character.Certainly, this is a film with big ambitions – it wants not only to pay tribute to the Bond films of the past, but also to rejuvenate the franchise for another jubilee. Thankfully, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes manages to preserve the Bond iconography and redefine the franchise's traits. After sitting out the last two movies, Q (or Quartermaster) is back, but in the form of a younger geek played by Ben Whishaw. Mendes also introduces what is likely to be a new recurring character in Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), a bureaucrat brought in to make M accountable for MI6's mistakes who later becomes a surprising ally.Mendes too has made this an actor's film, and nowhere in the history of the franchise will you find a better performed film. Every actor is perfectly cast, but two are especially worthy of singular mention. First is Javier Bardem, who injects pizazz and menace into his villainous role that is showy without being cartoony and edgy without being over-the-top. And then of course there is Daniel Craig, who in his third outing, truly makes the character his very own. More assured than he has ever been, Craig brings class, style, grit, temperance, determination and courage to make his Bond the most complex and captivating one we've seen yet.Even with the dramatic additions, Mendes knows the Bond fans need cool action – and just from the heart-stopping opening sequence in Istanbul, he lets you know that he is committed to the task. While its globe- trotting nature might invite similarities to 'Bourne', Mendes applies a much more expansive scope to the action without any of that shaky camera-work, so trust us when we say that the sequences here are simply exhilarating. In fact, the movie pulses with its own energy and momentum from start to finish, and despite running at more than two hours, you'd wish it could go on for longer.That sentiment is also how you know that producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli have succeeded in transiting James Bond from an old- school action hero to a contemporary one. Not only does it mark a turning point for the character, it also is for the franchise as a whole – and 'Skyfall' couldn't have arrived at a better time to breathe new life into 007. The wit, the action, the style are all as intact as ever after 50 years, but the drama is new, fresh and spellbinding - even if this Bond is older, he is also wiser and better than ever before.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
What have you done to the Aston Martin?!,"As Adele warbles the theme tune during the introduction, you realise: There's been a 10 minute opening sequence just to get to this point. Only the Bond films could get away with this. In case you think this is overlong though, savour it... As there isn't much else in the way of conflict for the first hour, besides James's psychological scars and M's attempts to stop herself getting fired for gross incompetence. Yes folks, this is a brave new world... Bond is seen as a bit of a dinosaur from a bygone era, and his philosophy of drinking dry Martinis and sleeping with anyone with a pulse doesn't cut the mustard with the modern 'enlightened' MI6. By the same token, the Bourne movies are starting to catch up with the 007 films in popularity AND quality, so has this recent entry got the to keep apace with the competition?Why, yes it does. It feels somewhat like a changing of the guard, with a big departee (no spoilers) and a few new additions who'll probably go on to be series regulars. As I said, it does start off s-l-o-w but this is more than made up for by the latter sections, which feature thrilling confrontations in the heart of London and right down in Bonnie Olde Scotland. To be honest, the story about a disgruntled ex-agent taking revenge on his old boss did not leave me shaken or stirred as it has been done to death in a million similar flicks. Javier Bardem scores as the baddie though, with his peroxide hair and his homosexual leanings he instantly cuts a memorable character. Him and Bond have a nice rapport, maybe, if things could have been different...Above all, it's a worthy addition to the franchise, and whets our appetite for the next entry.

Bond feels things, like in CR - but unlike CR which was Bond becoming Bond, here we have Bond as Bond - witty, debonair,charming, dangerous, a man who lives in the shadows and occasionally puts on a front of lightness.It is a more personal, character-driven film - but with superb action and AMAZING cinematography (seriously - some of the images in this film put Nolan's films in the shade!). The pre-credit sequence (yes, it's back) is worth the price of admission alone.In one way CR was like a break from the old Bonds. It was a fresh start and the stench of Ye Old Bonde had to be washed off.

Bond is back with the Bang,"Earlier, many of the critics rated the movie as the best Bond film, ever made. They were correct.Starting from the Roof top bike chase in Istanbul till the sentimental climax, Daniel Craig has shown his poise in each and every frame. The action and stunts scenes were fast and neat. Should definitely appreciate the costume designer for the perfect fit suits designed for stunts.Unlike other Bond movies, there is a lack of pace in the script as most of the story revolves only in London & Scotland with less importance in scenes pertaining to Shanghai, Macau & Istanbul. But the less, was equated with excellent cinematography and the best direction. Javier Bardem's role as villain was not only elegant, but proved himself with the vengeance on his eyes.

Brooding Bond,"Skyfall, one of the best-reviewed 007 entries, with some critics even calling it at the time a ""shoe-in for a Best Picture nomination (which didn't happen), shows Bond in a more introspective light. No emergency restarting of his heart to be found here. It's a good entry with a gripping final act, but getting there is more of a slow burn.Like Licence to Kill, Timothy Dalton's second (of two) 007 films, things get very personal in Skyfall. Without ruining some of the surprises, the plot centers around Raoul Silva, a former MI6 agent who switched to cyberterrorism for hire. Apparently with a big grudge against MI6, and M in particular. A series of terrorist events bring the story and the characters to Skyfall, 007's childhood home in the Scottish Highlands. It's here where the Bond film takes unusual turns (not surprising given the film's title).Preparing for the arrival of Silva and his army, 007, M and Kincade, the gamekeeper from his childhood, they set traps in the house to take them down. The movie enters Straw Dogs territory here. Through it all, 007 is deadly serious - no throwaway one liners a'la Connery or Moore Bonds here.This is all a big departure from the previous Daniel Craig Bonds. It's a big improvement over the muddled Quantum of Solace but in the end, not as good as Casino Royale. The terrorist explosions definitely give this Bond film a more realistic feel, however.Judi Dench returns (for the final time) as M. By the end of the film, Ray Fiennes settles himself in for that role. Silva is played by Javier Bardem, who takes the sociopathic elements from his character in No Country for Old Men and retools them for another character who is just as cunning, ruthless, and murderous. A surprise in the cast is Albert Finney as the gamekeeper at Skyfall, in his final film. He's not given much to do except set traps in the estate, but seeing him one last time is a pleasure.The almost universal praise of this movie is interesting; it must be the ""this is personal"" element to the story. But it would be back to global intrigue for the next outing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best Bond movie of the last 20 years,"I can not really be very original with my review, and most likely this will get lost under a ""mountain-slide"" of critics, however I just had to write how much I enjoyed this film. I have watched (like all movie goers) all the Bond films, and I think Daniel is one of the great ones. Connery has always been a favorite of mine, he gave Bond style and portrayed him as invincible. Almost like a super hero who fights for good. Shiny, Clean but Unreal. Craig has adapted the character to the modern age and has given him weaknesses and depth. I really like this approach. I always thought that Bond should have a human side too.Regarding the ""reset"" of the franchise, I think that this is a brilliant idea. Whomever thought of that, is truly the future and last hope of Hollywood. What the movies need are not special effects, but people with original ideas. The Bond ""reset"" has truly reset my love for the Series.Congrats for making one of the Best movies of 2012 !",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Why are IMDb Skyfall reviews seemingly so out of touch,"I liked this movie a lot. I am some what surprised by the number of negative reviews. Especially when Rotten Tomatoes is reporting high critical and audience numbers (91 percent). I suspect the Daniel Craig is Not Bond group is over-represented here and trying to flood the IMDb site with bad reviews.Get over it. The Bond franchise has moved on from its descent into lame self parody. As one who started watching the series from its inception, it has been a slowly disintegrating formula beginning with Diamonds Are Forever (admittedly with the occasional bright spot).Craig brings gravitas back to the series. Skyfall was a great action film with nice human moments. Come on you guys, you had decades of the slapstick, cardboard, comic book Bond. It is nice to have a James Bond with a some sort of relation to actual human feelings and failings. Skyfall has those human elements in spades.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Bold, emotional and still a Bond film","Daniel Craig isn't a traditional actor to play Bond therefore his Bond films aren't traditional either (yes even that abomination Quantum of Solace).Even though Casino Royale is the best of the Craig series, it lacked the certain Bond clichés we all love. Here we actually have some throwbacks in this reboot franchise. So there is something for the die hard Bond fans.The dialogue in this film is fantastic. Very organic, sophisticated, the bickering between Bond and his superiors and his colleagues is there, and we actually hear ""Bond. James Bond"".The characters in this film are solid and multi-dimensional. We get introduced to a young Q, who actually does more than just introduce gadgets. Tia Dalma (I forget the black chick's name) plays Eve Mo- ahem a fellow agent and you actually like her and the sexual tension between her and Bond. M here is a huge part of the story. She no longer is just the MI6 director who barks order and tells Bond off, she's one of the foci of the story. There is a really beautiful woman who's another Bond girl, but I found this one sort of forgettable. Like well into the film I forgot about her.And the villain. Wow his mullet was the most menacing thing I've ever seen. Javier Bardem plays Silva and as you can tell from the trailer he's a former agent. He's not a villain with a Machiavellian scheme, he's just out for (an elaborate sick, twisted) revenge. He's a great villain and he doesn't require a Persian cat or a hollowed out volcano.The story is much more dense here. Bond is given a lot more dimension like Dalton's. Unlike Timothy Dalton's Bond, he still has a deadpan sense of humour though. In the first two acts you get a general Bond film. In the third act however it becomes incredibly emotional.The ending of the film will remind a lot of people of Hard Target and Home Alone, this wasn't intentional but it happened. Nonetheless it's a very different kind of climax, and its refreshing to see one that doesn't take place in a villain's lair or submarine etc.One thing that will strike you are the visuals. Each shot has a rich blend of colours. The cinematographer and director were very meticulous here, job well done. I guess it's because the director's the guy who did American Beauty. So for those of you who knock digital film, well there you go.50 years into this series, and I'm pretty sure Ian Fleming would be proud.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Actors ensure that 'sky' is the only limit; Plot makes this take a 'fall',"////////---- NO Spoilers----////////The Start: The dazzling 007 defiantly chases a guy; performs breathtaking stunts; jumps over a train from a bridge (whilst on a goddamn bike!). Romance-loving-action-hating-men can't dismiss this as too fantastic (coz it ain't!) while vicarious-pleasure-taking-Bond-smitten-dudes can't say this to be an uncharacteristically toned down Bond action! (same reason). You see, such is the perfection of this scene, that it not only (seems to) justify the reboot in 10 minutes, but also results in becoming one the 2 best opening sequences this year (you've probably guessed the other one, TDKR). Problem? Yes, it is never topped in the remaining 130-odd min.The Middle: The movie paces inconsistently; M is the focus; not Bond. Even a hardcore fan will concede that Bérénice Marlohe is deliberately stuffed in. Editing her out will change the movie by 1% in terms of plot; 99% in terms of glamor. Only the jitter-inducing, surprisingly funny, and succinctly 'different' Bardem, while plotting to kill Bond, salvages this Bond movie (how ironic)!The remaining: The climax is dragged a bit, average action sequences with a rare brush of adrenaline-pumping brilliance notwithstanding, it's the spectacle that you'll see which'll inspire awe. Speaking of which, the other spontaneous cry to the director Mendes would be 'I can understand not handing an explosive pen to Bond to avoid clichés, but why for heaven's sake would he use an almost jammed & rusted weapon? Why a vintage car for a guy who's all about modernity?' Also Ralph Fiennes is so underused, you almost sense that there must be a huge compensation towards the end. At his role, Ian Fleming readers will cringe, Bond fans might feel satisfied while the others might not care that much (Sorry, that's all I can say without spoiling :-[ )Overall: Technically, an excellent movie; hence excellent reviews. But, the plot is weak. Usually, we've seen that when an adapted story has a weak plot, there is a deliberate attempt to twist the original storyline. Hence, creating the illusion of difference which that twist rubs off on the movie.Stars: Dench is convincing; Daniel Craig is awesome as our 'humanised' Bond; but it is Bardem who steals the show. Academy nomination? I wish!Direction is full of energy. The interesting part is that it was a lesser risk for Mendes with Bond as he is not really a hero per se, but more of a 'star'. However, is the keenness to stamp your style on an age-old ageless star valid at the cost of slightly belying his personality? That you judge.The movie is definitely not bad; but it leaves you with nothing much to remember about: Cause#1? Not enough adrenaline pumping action. Surprisingly low when you expect a stylized action Bond flick. Cause#2- Weak plot. No underlying purpose (unlike a ruthless young Bond wanting to rise in Casino Royale). There is an attempt to intellectualize the plot, but it comes at the cost of not providing details (not the Nolan-isque method of weaving a storyline capable of numerous subjective interpretations).Finally, I believe Bond fans must see this. People wanting to see intense acting of Craig and Bardem must as well. Others, well, renting a DVD would be much, much better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Ripoff?,I'm surprised that more people haven't noticed the similarities between Skyfall and The Dark Knight.

99% logic free,"This film is a good example of lazy writing. The story is pushed along without any consideration of reality, logic, or sense.

People escape from inescapable cells without any explanation of how they did it.

Motorcyles can ride on the tiled rooftops of buildings at 60 mph without ever running into the edge of the building.

Skyfall is Brilliant!,"I usually get to see Bond's at the cinema and have the big DVD boxset of all the Bond's up to the last, A Quantum of Solace. I missed Skyfall at the flicks and so when my local Tesco had it at ten to midnight, for £10, it was mine.And I watched straight away. Bond's still aren't perfect and never will be - we all have different expectations on both who Bond is now, who he should be and how well Daniel Craig is portraying him.For a start, no Bond will make total sense, which is good, you cannot have a 007 that isn't slightly barmy, fantastical and at least a bit macho. Sexism has largely gone, which suits the modern audience and the interplay between Judi Dench as 'M' and Craig is hypnotic. Others may find it incredulous. But, let's face it, Dame Judi can out-act anything and make it seem real, which is really what this milarky called acting is all about.Brit director (American Beauty his best to date) has done a superb job, mixing an incredibly exciting, totally implausible opening, from which 007 cannot possibly recover, to big sweeping and (obviously) expensive locational shoots. The Shanghai set scenes are amazing and immediately make you want to go there.There's an occasional and knowing irony and self-mocking of 'old' Bond, that's as dry as his shaken (not stirred!) vodka tonics, which are both clever and reassuring, aiding continuity within the franchise. Young Ben Wishaw makes for an unexpected (I had no idea) and effective 'Q', again keeping the franchise fresh and open to new story developments in the future.The prerequisite Bond baddie is taken up by a quite weird Javier Badem, all peroxide blonde...! whilst Ralph Fiennes is supremely suited as MI6 Top Brass. The girls are all beautiful (of course) and Adele's title song (and having just won a BAFTA) is big on presence and stature - a very worthy addition to that title of Bond Theme.Albert Finney is almost unrecognisable as a white bearded old Scotsman, defending a castle, in Scotland, where the film ends, in a rather Western style sort of shoot-out. I won't say any more on this!I, personally, thoroughly enjoyed every single minute of Skyfall. I expected to and I wasn't disappointed. I'll watch it again within a few days, guaranteed!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best Bond Ever!!!,"To start out let me say I'm not a Bond film fan. I like action movies though the Bond films never appealed to me. I found them not intelligent enough, until now... Sam Mendes is a filmmaker, not an action filmmaker, and a good one. He knows you don't need a whole film to develop a character but one good dialog scene. He knows how to film a good action scene, how to make actors give their best, how to show respect to the series without falling into their mistakes. He is a master of his class. The performances from Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem and Judi Dench are amazing, but Ben Wishaw was my favorite character because of his well written dialog. The action was not pointless, it furthered plot and characters. The film is unable to be compared with the rest of the series because this ones is actually a good film, not an action film. Sam Mendes did what Joss Whedon did for Avengers and Chris Nolan did for Batman. He breathed life into an impossible franchise. Good job Mendes! Keep it up!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Excellent Choice for the Role of EVE,"Thought Naomie Harris as Eve is excellent- she was , sexy,thoughtful,surprising, a super talent- great actor. loved her performance.

I don't think so- but it is very different. A black or Asian JB in the future? why not there is some great British talent from the black and Asian communities.I'm pleased Sam Mendes had the foresight to pick Miss Harris for one of the lead roles.I would recommend Skyfall as one of the best movies of 2012 It is great to see British film production at it's best, from the crew ,gaffer teams to sound and super camera work.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Bond girl lights up the screen during her very brief screen time.4. The London sequence chase sequence.5. The Shanghai sequences are good but Komodo dragons are native to Indonesia, not China.Cons1.

A very vivid story from Ian Fleming translated to a film by Sam Mendes,"With a very vivid story from Ian Fleming translated to a film by Sam Mendes, off- course with a lot of help from manuscript writers, production team, actors, technicians and more, this is truly a one-to-watch film.This is the latest mission of James Bond and it is truly bringing both the classic legendary agent back with a couple of props from a time long a go :) and it is also setting a new standard for high impact action films, that doesn't rely entirely on CGI and effects. This has much less focus on gadgets then earlier films, but is more concentrated on the settings, the intensity and the depth of the characters and the story that evolves.This film shows Daniel Craig as James Bond, but in kind of a new way, a better more classy and old school way. It also brings back the super villain, a villain that is tricky, a step ahead, devious and manipulative and Javier Bardem certainly plays this character to perfection.If you haven't seen this or any Bond film at all, go for it, this is truly great work, very entertaining, action packed and a very good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Do you need examples? Gerad Buttler, Ewan McGregor, Henry Cavill, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, just few names of possible but certainly believable drop dead gorgeous James Bond. Please don't try ever again to make James Bond "" more real, more human"". You cannot make him real, he is not supposed to be real!!!

But it is not Skyfall.In a confusing world, where cyberspace decides the fate we see Bond is a living in a grey world where good and bad are no longer absolutes - the villain (Bardem) is again much darker than any before and is a surprisingly complex character. Bond is shown deliberately not on top of his game - this is a film about the borderlines, the shadows, and reality of the spy game - well, to a certain extent, after all it is Bond, and there are a number of set scenes with motorbikes and trains that are as good as anything in any Bond film.At 2.5 hours this is easily the longest Bond film to date - and it is also a character study - perhaps we don't really want to know Bond - we want him to be a superhero and fun and not human.

Skyfall is not a real Bond movie,"Skyfall was probably the worst Bond movie I've ever seen, except for maybe Moonraker in which Bond actually goes to outer space - come on you cannot beat that in epic failures - and for On Her Majesty's Secret Service which ends with the villain shooting Bond's wife right after their wedding. (what was even more intolerable then the ending was George Lazenby's acting) It just didn't have enough content and material to be a movie, was more like a lenghtened episode from a spy series. As opposed to many, I did not like Javier Bardem as the villain, he can play a terrific villain if he wants to, look at No Country For Old Men, he just couldn't deliver here, still seemed to me like Juan Antonio Gonzalo from Vicky Cristina Barcelona, one of Bardem's finer hours. Skyfall is a celebration of all things British, it is a celebration of England actually and I don't have a problem with that especially since it is the 50 th anniversary of Bond, nothing wrong with returning to your origins and paying tribute to the old 007s.

A traditional folktale for the ages ...and for all ages,"The Bond movies transcend the Bond books, in the same way ""Casablanca"" transcended a so-so play that never made it to Broadway: ""They All Came to Rick's."" Where Ian Fleming ground out snobbish and often silly stories in imitation of a rather nasty and racist writer, ""Sapper"" McNeile, the Bond films have created their own magic. Not all the movies have been great, of course. But in a half- century, a surprisingly number of them have achieved greatness. One of them is ""Skyfall."" It takes the by-now familiar ideas and themes (""tropes"" in critic- talk) of beyond-the-pale arch-villain, technology bent to evil purposes, scenic tours of the world's most photogenic spots, scenic tours of the world's most photogenic women, noise and gadgetry, a preposterous plot/scheme/conspiracy, and a secret agent with the skill sets of Hercules, Horatio Hornblower, Sir Galahad, Michael Strogoff, Courier of the Czar (check him out) and Mr. Spock ... and conjures up a breathtaking world of action and entertainment -- a circus with a theme, or trope, if you will. But best of all, it uses an extremely able cast to tell an adult story. Yes, adult! By now the whole world knows that Judi Dench is one of the greatest actors living today. Here, she shows us why. This is not the ""M"" of 10-second tirades, or an exasperated school- marm. In ""Skyfall,"" ""M"" is a three-dimensional person. Dench's scenes will probably be studied in acting classes for some time to come. Daniel Craig finally comes to grips with the Bond character, and, in so doing, creates a believable James Bond who is really capable of the derring-do that's part of his job description, yet maintains a very touching humanity. He harks back to the proletarian roughneck of Sean Connery, a type today's British Intelligence and SAS are more likely to employ than aristocratic dilettantes (although the latter did prove their worth in leading charges against machine guns in World War I, armed with nothing but a swagger stick and a Webley Mk VI revolver.)

Rebounds from the underwhelming Quantum of Solace and gives a Bond film that celebrates the older films while allowing it forge on its established path.,"Following a botched mission in Istanbul, James Bond (Daniel Craig) is seemingly killed in a crossfire by a fellow MI6 agent (Naomie Harris) and a list of undercover NATO operatives has now found its way into the hands of unknown hostiles. A few months later, MI6 is still reeling from the political fallout and is also subject to cyberattacks that specifically reference M (Judi Dench). Having been living off grid, Bond returns to MI6 following news of the cyberattacks and is sent back in the field on M's authority despite not passing the aptitude tests and showing signs of physical, mental, and emotional strain. Bond's investigation leads him to an enigmatic figure named, Silva (Javier Bardem), a powerful and well connected cyberterrorist with a vendetta against M.Following the release of Quantum of Solace, MGM and EON set to work on a follow-up only to be curtailed by MGM's bankruptcy and financial troubles. The script went through a number of revisions taking elements from Fleming stories You Only Live Twice and Man with the Golden Gun and remixing them into a story centered very much around Judi Dench's M character. The movie upon its release became a smash hit both critically and commercially and held the distinction of being the first Bond movie to cross $1 billion at the box office. Skyfall pays homage to the classic tropes of the Bond series while still allowing itself to go in the same bold direction set up in Casino Royale.Craig's Bond continues to be a very strong and very human take on the character, with Bond's near death experience having left him in a shaken state that has begun to take a toll on him. The movie puts the relationship between M and Bond to the forefront here culminating in a satisfying payoff from what was established over the course of the first two films. Judi Dench has given a fantastic performance over the course of these three films with her character greatly expanded and given more dramatic weight from when she first took on the role in the Brosnan era, and the movie gives her character a satisfying way of closing out her journey and her mentorship with Bond. Javier Bardem is a fantastic antagonist for Bond as Silva following the underwhelming Dominic Greene from Quantum of Solace, and Bardem does really well in the role as an almost twisted mirror image of Bond who like Bond had a mentor relationship with M and also like Bond was injured in the field from actions taken by M. Silva is a formidable opponent for Bond with seemingly limitless resources at his beck and call and mastery of cybernetic infrastructure leaving much of MI6's higher end resources at risk or unavailable.The movie's action is excellent with a nicely handled and is back at the standard from Casino Royale following the quick cut mess of Quantum of Solace. Stuart Baird is welcome in his return to editing from Casino Royale (alongside Kate Baird) and cinematographer Roger Deakins gives us some of the most beautiful and dynamic shots we've seen in a Bond film yet, including a climactic siege sequence in Scotland, a good chunk of which takes place at night, and makes it one of the best night shot action sequences I've seen of recent memory. Scenes in Shanghai and Macau look stunning and the production design looks incredible and eye catching with unique environments that are used for memorable action sequences.The movie also has a strong supporting cast with Naomie Harris as a Bond girl and fellow MI6 agent having some great scenes opposite Craig (her name isn't mentioned until the very end of the movie and is a great payoff). Ben Whishaw is a welcome addition as the new take on Q, MI6's Quartermaster, with his dry delivery and technical prowess fitting well within the tone and world established in the Craig series. Ralph Fiennes is also quite welcome as M's associate Gareth Mallory who has some really strong interactions with Judi Dench and is well established for future Bond installments. And last but certainly not least is Albert Finney as Kincade, a figure from Bond's past who joins M and Bond for the climax and gives us some of the best moments in the film.Skyfall easily shares the same company as Casino Royale as an example of just how strong the Craig era of Bond truly is. With strong action and character, the movie recovers from the stumble of Quantum of Solace and delivers an entertaining and enthralling ride. There are some stretches in logic with Silva's hacking abilities bordering on ""wizard-like"" in terms of how much havoc he's capable of unleashing, and the climax asks you to swallow quite a bit to buy the setup and payoff, but with so many strong elements Skyfall makes a satisfying Bond experience that continues Craigs exemplary run as the character.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond has changed for the better.,"James Bond, since Daniel Craig took over, is nothing like the films of old. Casino Royale and Quatum of Solace are contemporary outings, switching cheese and swatch with seriousness and sophistication. A serious overhaul was needed. Lo and behold, Skyfall, the peak of Craig's 007. Bond comes of out hiding after an attack on M (Dench) and the MI6. Other agents are being picked off, so it's up to Bond to look after M, and once again save the day. Skyfall's got Bond written all over it, except this time it's simplified, almost going back to the beginning. As Q (now Ben Wishaw) says 'what did you expect, an exploding pen?' Bond's hurt. His pride broken, beaten and scarred. He doesn't have the time to heal with Javier Bardem's former agent testing his loyalty to M and the MI5. We learn more about Bond than we've ever known. Skyfall's simple, gripping and effective, its personal touch stands out. 007 has changed, and change is for the good.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Nothing spectacular for the 50th year anniversary,"Well, let me mention at the outset that being a huge fan of the Bond franchise the anticipation and expectation from every next bond film has ever been growing. I personally feel Daniel Craig makes the best Bond of all times - Rugged, realistic, dark in demeanor.Having said that, Skyfall falls short of being a good film. (Not just talking about being a good Bond film). The artistic cinematography, the strangely varying pace and the theme which tries to blend old school and state of the art technology makes you wonder if it is skirmishes with film noir. Nevertheless, the plot gives it away, with no real meat or strength in development, the movie does not offer anything to stimulate the grey cells of the audience. It actually makes you rethink the definition of Bond film itself by overly trying to make it transformational from the out-of-the-world-gadgetry Bond to more real- life human being who is explicitly advised by the new, younger, geeky Q that the real world don't need exploding pens.Even comparing to the earlier Bond movies by Craig, it seems all the more diluted from the Bond franchise. After all, we do expect villainy of gigantic proportions when it is Bond who is on the screen and not such a predictable climax which revolves around expected personal vendetta.All in all, it is a must watch for any true Bond fan, I can't stop you from hitting the theaters. But you would rather enjoy the old Goldfinger or From Russia with Love, thinking in retrospect once you reach home.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Finally a Daniel Craig Bond film with some grit,"In comparison to the 2 previous offerings, this is a notable improvement, helped in no small way by Ralph Fiennes joining the cast and the introduction of a worthy villain portrayed brilliantly by Javier Bardem. Overall, a better script, musical score and there were even some gadgets and a nice little hat tip to the classic theme and Aston Martin. Still a far cry from the winning formula of old but at least a step in the right direction. Still lacking charisma and overall fun element but at least a bit more engaging.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Really solid and well made, though it really does lack originality. Never boring, never amazing.","Skyfall (2012)In many ways this is a return to a full-fledged Bond archetype. The special effects are still spectacular, and the tricks and impressive smarts and physical stunts are still terrific. But here is the man, James Bond, with a sense of history, character, persona. And just as the Nolan Batman movies rise above through character development, so does ""Skyfall"" make the most of the essence of ""Bond"" the legend and uber-spy.The key to this was in the middle of the opening chase and fight scene, highly and wonderfully improbable, where he lands after a series of crashing and crushing cars (VW Beetles as his sidekick almost too obviously notes), suddenly he's inside a train car full of passengers and before dashing for his life after the bad guy, he straightens his cuff. That, after all, is James Bond, with gorgeous suits as important as gorgeous women.Walking out with my girlfriend slightly unimpressed by the whole two hours plus of this, despite the strong beginning, I heard the key to it all. She said it wasn't fantastic enough, it didn't push the edge enough. Think of Dr. No or other early villains with their incredible complexes of evil set in exotic locales. And I think she's right, because this lacked some kind of unique 007 flair. It's a really well made movie, exciting and bold, that much we can all agree on.But guess what? That's the norm these days. There are so many movie with tremendous chases, fights, fireballs, and even crashing trains these aren't distinguishing traits anymore (including the ""Incredibles,"" which borrows tropes like they were your neighbor's tools).What's new? In a way the biggest ""trick"" is the dipping into the past, literally. A classic Austin is pulled out complete with machine guns mounted in the grill. A joke is made about low tech gadgets like the radio (a radio!) he is given, and then it saves him. And there is Moneypenny, the twist being only that she is now black. I'm not sure that's a triumph--I'm ready for a black Bond, actually. Now that, think about it, is new. It's a new world. Check out the U.S. elections.What about Daniel Craig? This is his best Bond, to my naive eyes (I'm a Sean Connery fan at heart). But he manages a coolness that doesn't just become lack of life. The ""women"" around him (a Bond cliché) are actually held in check, so we aren't subjected to the same sexualized objectification as the earlier films. Good.And Javier Bardem? He's great. But he's no Joker (either Nicholson or Ledger). In fact, the whole attempt at being outrageous (the computer stuff, the glass cage) is painfully small minded stuff. Maybe this is Sam Mendes's fault, ultimately. He's a first rate director, but normally plays deft with psychology and creepy human types, not action-adventure.See it. It's a good film, a good Bond film. The fact it isn't what it could have been by several important levels is not so terrible. It's fun, powerfully made, and a necessary step in the evolution of the genre--the genre of its own making, Bond, James Bond.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"An impressive Bond debut for Mendes, but nothing groundbreaking.","If 'Quantum of Solace' left you a little empty then Sam Mendes' 'ressurection' of the 007 franchise is enough to bury that hatchet, even if the highly anticipated blockbuster is not of the standards of Casino Royale in 2006.Craig is superb as ever and is surrounded with an equally impressive cast consisting of Judi Dench as M, Ben Whishaw as Q and 'No Country For Old Men's' Javier Bardem who is excellently disturbing as international villain Silva. The cast overall is exemplary and worthy to be mentioned in the same bracket as a hugely popular James Bond title.Cinematography and beautiful imagery is epitomised within the opening 20 minutes as we see Craig's athletic Bond undergo a nail biting pursuit of hit-man Patrice (Ola Rapace). It renders intertextuality with the opening sequence of 'Casino Royale' as Craig pursues Sebastien Foucan.Although the film focuses on building on characterisation between M and Bond, it appears to refract off the road of Bond and you will question whether you are watching a Bond film on occasions. The plot follows a more original route and fans searching for originality will get there just deserts; however, it's never quite as exciting or groundbreaking as 'Casino Royale' was, following up from the mediocre 'Die Another Day.'In short, while it's no doubt an excellent action flick with great casting members, 'Skyfall' is not a revolutionary movie despite it's powerful emotional strength.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bonds Birthday Blockbuster,"In James Bonds 50th anniversary the creators take the series back to its roots while also making more than just another Bond movie. England's best spy finds himself hiding away in the tropics while suffering an apparent midlife crisis after being shot in the exciting pre-creititorial scenes. Sam Mendes work as director on this film played a monumental role in its success. Skyfall showcases all the usual elements of a Bond film, the chases, the girls, the arch villain but recharged with intelligence and a less superior, more exploring empathy.
Bond returns to MI6 in the time it needs him the most. Agent 007 fails all of his physical and mental exams, and on top of that he shoots his gun as straight as a monkey could. But while knowing all of this, his boss M still believes he is the right person for the job. Her government overseer seems to disagree.
The script was written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade who have previous bond experience and should be experts by now. Many people have compared the story of this movie to that of The Dark Night. But between Purvis, Wade, and Mendes I believe they found a better balance of light and dark. They gave Bond a little more humility and personality that I think people can resonate with.
Then there is the villain (Javier Bardem). The character of Silva is great and filled the role of antagonist perfectly. Again to reference the The Dark Night, the character of Silva reminds me a lot of the Joker. His mannerisms and the way he talks almost mirrors the Joker, all the way down to the face deformation.
All in all I absolutely loved this movie. They took Bond right back to its original principles while also adding some great humanity aspects to to the terminator of James Bond. Mandes took on the hard task of continuing the legacy of Bond and still had the confidence to give it his own little twist and in my opinion it was all perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

The best 007 film ever,"This is by far the best 007 film I have watched, including the films since Sean Connery and Roger Moore. Skyfall showed that it would not be just one more already in the opening scene and initial credits. Afterwards, with the very best script and a competent direction it did achieve a higher level probably no James Bond movie ever reached. It is much deeper than all of them, previous or tepid Spectre. Bond and M's lives and relationship are dealt in a more mature and complex way 8n Skyfall than we are accostumed to in 007 franchise. Besides that, action scenes, original Adèle's song and locations are breathtaking. The villain portrayed by Bardem is also the best nemesis for James Bond ever. To resume, Skyfall was able to, being a much deeper and seriously developped movie, be true to the character and to the franchise, in many elements present in the story until the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Superlative is Skyfall, do not miss it film fans","James Bond (Daniel Craig) is in Istanbul, tracking an evil hitman Patrice. This bad dude has killed a British agent and now James has to begin a wild chase to prevent him from getting away. Backing him up is lovely Eve (Naomie Harris). The two agents chase him through streets by car, then James jumps on a motorcycle to follow through markets and over rooftops. Finally, Mr. Bond jumps on a train Patrice has boarded and the two fight it out on the train's rooftop. Ordered by M (Judi Dench) to take a shot, poor Eve ends up wounding James, who falls into the water. Patrice gets away and Bond is presumed dead and gone. But, not so. After a brief hiatus, Bond appears in London again, when the Secret Service building is set on fire. M is very glad to see him, because Patrice's boss has captured a disc with agents' names all over the world and M herself is getting scary messages. Traveling to Shanghai, Bond again wrestles with Patrice on a high rise and Patrice is thrown to his death. Nevertheless, James melts the heart of a beautiful underling Severine and they travel to meet the top evildoer, Silva (Javier Bardem). Silva, once an agent for Britain, makes clear his plans to continue killing. But, oh, Bond gets the upper hand and takes Silva prisoner to London, where he is sentenced to prison. But, is this really where Silva will go or does he have ingenious plans to break out of his chains? Unfortunately, the ex-agent does and its all out war between Silva and the Brits. How will it end? This film deserves ten stars for its superlative cast, plot, cinematography and every other element. Craig is so good as his own battle weary type of Bond while Bardem is one of the top villains in Bond history, being evil, mad, but somehow to be pitied. All of the others, including Dench, Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Albert Finney and Ben Whishaw are also topnotch. As for the scenery, it is sumptuous while the direction by Sam Mendes is beyond terrific.

Fair Enough For a Bond Film,This is not the best Bond movie I have seen but the story is unique and this film does add some new twists in it. Daniel Craig is back as this is his third James Bond movie. There are some good action sequences that make up for the typical Bond formula of a movie. I find this Bond movie to be more of a drama side to it as Daniel Craig's character expresses more emotion in this film. I did think this movie ran a little too long and there were a little too many dull scenes that seem they didn't need to be in the movie. The movie does run a little long like I said as right when you think it may be over it still keeps going. This movie does still have the classic vibes that goes in many Bond movies as there's the classic car and the opening action sequence. I think this film can definitively improve though. This movie is worth watching but take that it's not the typical Bond series movie.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Modern day action packed, with a touch of class.","Cast: Daniel Craig of course returns as Ian Fleming's James Bond, so nothing new to note there just a continuation of a great performance. Supporting cast and i have to say first that i loved Ben Wishaw as Q. When he first show and everything I was worried about this hipster kid taking over the iconic older part, but it worked and i love it. Ralph Finnes is a government official who, no spoilers, but keeps an eye on Bond and MI6. Javier Bardem plays the villain, and is fantastic. His character background is perfect spy action movie, and his camp yet genius take on the villain is brilliant. I liked Naomie Harris, she plays an almost Bond girl, sexy and smart, but providing a nice payoff every now and then, especially at the end. Finally, there is one member of the cast who if doesn't win an Oscar or every other form of award for best supporting role, it's Dame Judi Dench as M. No spoilers to the plot, but she is more involved than in the previous movies and she is just bloody brilliant.Overview: Again no spoilers, but the story is pretty tight. No a direct sequel to the disaster that was Quantum Of Solace, thank god. Now I personally am not a big Bond guy. I've seen from Tomorrow Never Dies onwards, and I saw From Russia With Love, at a special screening at Cineworld, but even then, there are certain things, that in pop culture stand out as being James Bond. This movie recognises it's 50 year anniversary by having a lot of little moments that say 'Yes this is a Bond movie and here this is' I'm not going to spoil them all, but MINOR SPOILER my favourite was when Bond opens a garage door and sitting there is his old Aston Martin and the Bond theme kicks in, it was satisfying to me, a movie pop culture fan-boy, so real Bond fans brace yourselves. The action is very Bond over the top, there are some one liners, and the plot is very good. It leaves you and the characters guessing right up to the end. Eagle eyed viewers will see the entire plot of the film in usual Bond fashion in the opening montage as Adele sings her Skyfall song, not my cup of tea musically, but not bad.Recommend: Definitely, as an action film and as a part of the Bond franchise.

007's True Genesis: 'Skyfall,"Watching ""Skyfall"", I felt like I was on a historic journey in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the James Bond series. The film's nods to the past and Bond's decision to confront rather than flee from his history deeply resonated with me, offering a closer look into the depth and evolution of the character.The charismatic and intricate portrayal of the villain truly captivated me. This wasn't just any typical Bond villain; this was a character with depth and allure. This profound impact was undoubtedly due to the stellar performances. Each actor played their role so convincingly, especially Daniel Craig, whose portrayal of Bond was nothing short of mesmerizing.As a viewer left unsatisfied by the previous film, ""Skyfall"" reminded me of why this series is so beloved. And of course, the music... The theme song ""Skyfall"", performed by Adele, was as captivating and memorable as the film itself. Both in melody and lyrics, it perfectly complemented the cinematic experience.In conclusion, ""Skyfall"" wasn't just another Bond film; it was THE Bond film. It was an unforgettable experience in the James Bond series for me, and it undoubtedly deserves an 8/10 rating.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

While not the most original story in the Bondseries is compelling because we get a glimpse of Bond's past. Things the books hinted about are revealed here. This might be the most personal Bond film since on her majesty's secret service. And Daniel Craig nails the Role of James Bond perfectly. There are no more comparisons to Sean Connery. The Role is Craig's. He is now just as good as Connery was. And the real beauty of SKYFALL is that while it's a JAmes Bond Reboot. The Ending sets us up for the more traditional James Bond Universe that we all know and love. I enjoyed Skyfall greatly simply because I've seen every 007 movie ever made from Barry Nelson's Casino Royale to Skyfall itself. And all I've got to say is it's a film all Bond fans will like.

Much better than Quantum of Solace,"Finally, the return of Daniel Craig as Bond. At the first the movie follows the typical Bond spy vs. spy type film.

I've read other reviews saying it's the worst Bond ever. That's ridiculous, have you seen the original Casino Royale? Daniel Craig has been criticized as being a blow up, high impact, no smart gadget Bond. I agree. He's a Bond for today's generation.

Well done but not exceptional,"The story and its execution have that well-known Bond feel. Because of this the good guys and bad guys are predictable. That is why we still watch 007 after 60 years.

Bond #23: Coming home,"In the opening scene, Bond is chasing an enemy over the roofs of train cars until he is seemingly killed by friendly fire. When there is a bomb going off in the MI6 headquarters, M can only rely on 007, the agent presumed dead, to find out who is responsible for the bombing. The villain Silva (Javier Bardem) is captured quickly and easily, but his plans really just begin with his escape in London. Bond and M have to prepare for battle in Bond's homeland in Scotland, outnumbered and almost without weapons...At 143 minutes, the movie is definitely too long, moving slowly especially in the first hour. The episode of Bond traveling to Macao, just to cash in chips, kick a few baddies and obtain a suitcase, seems unnecessary and should have been cut completely. This movie's strength is not in exotic locations this time - 'Skyfall' is the only Bond in which the majority of scenes are set in the UK: first London, later Scotland. This is what makes it special, also the relationship between Bond and M is developed further, and we learn more about Bond's past. The battle in the old dark house is well staged. Bond faces the most psychopathic villain ever, a creepy guy with a distorted face (a victim of poisoning) and a death wish. Sometimes I found Bardem's performance bordering on the ridiculous, but I guess it's a matter of taste. All in all, an interesting and unusual contribution to the series, not simply following the well trodden path.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Is this truly a Bond movie?,"The action genre is evolving. Some people like the direction taken by recent action movies, and others don't. In the constantly changing world of action movies, James Bond used to be the steadfast rock of Gibraltar: one could always (for conveniently chosen values of always) count on Bond to deliver a uniformly pleasant experience, including — an entrancing credit sequence; a larger than life villain; a fantastic plan to take over the world; awesome gadgets straight out of a science-fiction novel; a gorgeous Bond girl; beautifully photographed exotic locations; and, of course, breathtaking action. Skyfall's credit sequence is, well, meh. Adele is a great singer, but the visuals are nowhere near the level expected. The villain is under-meh. If you can call him a villain at all, since he's more in the nature of a killer. Real villains use killers as hired help. Plan to take over the world? what plan to take over the world? There are no gadgets to speak of, outside a handgun taken from The Weapon Shops of Isher (fortunately promptly lost and forgotten) and a vintage automobile (proof that the heyday of the British motor industry is well past). And a radio tracker. Bond girl? there are two characters which sport a faint family resemblance to a Bond girl, like second cousins twice removed, and that's that. For exotic locations we get very brief glimpses of two south-east Asian cities, or rather one city and one den of perdition. Unless you accept that a misty and brooding Scottish moor is an acceptable substitute for an exotic location in a Bond movie. Which brings me back to the problem of the underwhelming action. The pre-credits sequence is very good. And that's it. The only other Bond-level sequence lasts for less than 20 seconds and involves an underground train. An empty underground train.Overall, Skyfall is a decent film. It has a tinge of action, and it illustrates certain uncomfortable areas of the relationship between democracy and secret services. But is it a true Bond movie? I don't think so. Anyway, I'm eager to find out whether this will remain a one-of-a-kind or it will open a period of evolutionary change in the Bond franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Skyflop?,"Plot? What plot? I've seen bigger plots in our local allotments, and they probably cost more than the budget for Skyfall's script. I just don't get where all the rave reviews are coming from. Skyfall is what I would call a washing-line film - lots of big impressive scenes hung together on a very thin story. It is rather sad that James Bond has succumbed to Hollywood's current formula for creating a 'block-buster' by stitching together evermore jaw-dropping set pieces in the hope of convincing you that you've seen a 'great film.' However, the lack of compelling story not-withstanding, Skyfall is still a good entertaining watch simply because of the excellent direction by Sam Mendes, the superb photography and spectacular special effects. One fight scene in particular was utterly mesmerising. I'm not giving anything away if I say that the two undoubted stars of the film are a wonderfully evil villain and a car – between them they just about manage to raise Skyfall to rank just above your average shoot-'em-up/blow-'em-up FX thriller.

Pretty Good!,"I live in the UAE and the movie was released here today for some very fortunate reasons and i managed to watch it.First of all, it is quite different from your regular bond movie. there is certainly a lot more drama. it also have a quite personal story. even bond's past is looked at a bit. about his parents and where he grow up. I personally liked that. It gives him more of a human look. rather than just a killing machine.Second thing i want to talk about is the acting. I am now completely convinced that Javier Bardem is a genius. if I had any doubts before, now they're gone. he was amazing. easily one of the best villains on Bond. also I think Daniel Craig's performance as James Bond was the best one so far. he did really well. Sam Mendez's directing was a pure beauty. loved it. I recommend this to everyone. even if you have never watched a Bond movie. cheers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Trust my word when i tell you that this experience is worth every penny and more!,"Of course you have heard nil but good things about the latest Bond movie, and let me assure you that they are nothing if not understatements. From the first scene we can see the fabulously filmed, action -packed intro's that Bond fans love so much, followed by a beautifully written intro sequence song performed by Adele. A key aspect of this film was the superb range of locations Bond is dropped in, from the urban, city lit-skyscrapers of Singapore to the rural moorlands of Scotland, viewers will never be short of a stunning piece of scenery every so often. An excellent cast really made this film the 9/10 it so definitely deserves, giving is the wonderful acting from Ralph Fiennes and Javier Bardem, who both give their characters that extra prominence. Now we all understand that a Bond film needs an imposingly brilliant antagonist that questionably Quantum of Solace was lacking However Skyfall really hit the nail of the head with the character of Silva, a sadistically, terrifyingly cynical baddie that really stands out from most villains. In summary, Skyfall was definitely the highlight of the film aspect of 2012, dominating the likes of Batman and the Avengers, making it a well- worth experience that will leave you thirsting for a suit on your body and a gun in your hands.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Daniel Craig once again scores as James Bond in Skyfall while Judi Dench does a more dramatic M here,"Who would have thought that 50 years after initially beginning the film series with Dr. No, James Bond would continue on his 23rd in the official cannon with Skyfall? Daniel Craig is back for the third time in the role while Judi Dench is once again playing boss M for the seventh. It seems her career is on trial for some fatal mistakes during it and Ralph Fiennes looks to be taking over. But first, there's Javier Bardem as the latest villain to contend with. All I'll mention now is that while there's still some good action here, there's also some great drama concerning Bond and M and also a nice juicy part for veteran Albert Finney. Really, all I'll say now is I highly recommend Skyfall.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Craig's best but not of BOND's,"If you compare to the other Daniel Craig's previous 2, its the best but i am surprised about loosing mission even before halfway.

And here is the list of some stupidest incidents in SKYFALL... 1. Original mission was to get the MI6 List from an agency but suddenly no one knows why...Mission become to save mummy (M) from a former feel-cheated agent... 2.

For Me Much Better than Quantum,"This weekend the latest Bond film released and from the reports seems to already making nice money. For this reviewer though, my excitement was relatively low after watching Quatum of Solace so many years ago. Still a couple of friends and I caught the afternoon showing with the hopes that the franchise would make up for their previous work. I'm happy to say that our hopes were not dashed as Skyfall impressed us and renewed our faith in the series. If you're up for hearing my highlights read on as we dive into Daniel Craig's latest film.For those who have been in the dark, Skyfall starts with Bond (Craig) on another adrenaline fueled mission to recover a hard drive containing all the agents' identity. As seen in the trailer, a fellow agent named Eve (Naomie Harris) follows orders and supposedly send James down the river. However, like an ignorant stain that Bond returns once more after a threat to M (Judi Dench) 's life. The culprit of this crime is a rogue agent by the name of Silva (Javier Bardem)who has a personal vendetta to take out the head of MI6, in hopes of achieving his insane goals.The summary of the trailer is pretty much the story of this film, so don't expect too many twists and turns to come up in this film. It's simply a plot for revenge for previous acts, that while fun and quick really lacks any Bond Finesse. Those seeking the classic spy mystery and information gathering may be disappointed, as this Bond continues to move towards the action franchise. However, there is a bit of backstory to help keep things interesting, as we uncover more of James' past, and learn a little more about the dark side of M, at least pertaining to Silva. A few other events unfold in the movie, but most of them I saw coming from the earlier events in the movie. Perhaps the only thing you might be wondering in this movie is the tie in to the title, as every bond movie has some connection to it.Don't really care about the complexity of the story? Well then do you care about action, because this movie has got it going on. Bond's move have gotten more bad@$$ as he ages, trading in the typical one shot running kills, for a little more martial arts and more intense shootouts. Want proof? Okay, the first ten minutes of the movie is an intense chase, mixed with a touch of shooting, a little ingenuity, and a pinch of a fist fight all brilliantly captured to keep you in the loop. I was on the edge of my seat with excitement as I watched everything unfold, appreciating the fast pace to start the film off with a bang. The only downfall was that after such a pumping start, you feel the crash afterward, but not for too long as the action continued to occur throughout the movie. While all of them have impressive moves, these scenes are only a fraction of the time. For me these were small doses that led up to the grand finale at the end, that were just enough to break away from the dry conversation, but not overdone to have you rolling your eyes. Patience pays off though, as the final scene is filled with enough ingenuity, stunts, and suspense to reward the audience.Putting the action aside, Skyfall takes a few nostalgic turns back in time that fans will appreciate. The dialog itself contained a few classic lines that will make you chuckle, or at least make you respect the movie even more. Putting the bond references to the side, Skyfall's dialog is just funny itself, as the rivalry between the characters provides openings for insults, sarcasm, and other quips to keep one entertained. However, the biggest Bond nostalgia comes in the gadgets, but I'm not really going to say much as I'll ruin it. Regardless, keep your eyes open as I'm sure there are plenty of things I missed that others will pick up.As for the acting, well it's pretty much the same as the previous installments, good. Although not as suave or elegant as some of his predecessors, Craig has the killer edge to make him a good agent. I was impressed not only with his moves, but also his ability to deliver his quips with just enough emphasis to make his intentions known. Dench as well stays strong to the role, using her British background to keep the pride of the old program head alive. Like Craig, she too has just the right emotion in her words to make it feel real, and not an overacted dribble, though fans might not expect to see her fight, which was a surprise to me. Continuing on Bardem did a good job playing an emotionally disturbed, though creepy bad guy. His voice in particular had the calm collected edge to give you the creeps without going into a screaming rant, or some other stereotypical villain. Unfortunately, the directors made his calling card a little too plain for my tastes, which took the edge off of this villain for me. Well that and the fact he didn't do much other than send in thugs, and do computer hacking, which although smart was a little less flashy from the other villains.Skyfall is perhaps the first bond movie in a long time I would go see again. With a fast paced story, lots of action, and countless classic references this movie is a nice balance and a good step up. My only hope is with all the changes this one makes, there will be new challenges they will have to face. There is still plenty of things to say, but I'm reaching my limit so to wrap it up: it's worth seeing in theaters. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Crime: 8.0-8.5 Movie Overall: 8.0",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"""Where is the bond I love gone""","Stylish, classic opening scene with a theme song to rival any of the classic Bonds. You are immediately thrown back in time to the bonds of old. A by-gone era of style and understated ""Cool""But unfortunately for this viewer, this is where the nostalgia ride ended. I even said to my cinema buddy after the opening song and traditional beginning ""this is going to be good""I go to a bond film for the wow factor and the promise of : GADGETS : Which you know bond will have to use to save himself later on in the film. CARS : A dream car which will be driven hard and is on every mans ""secret bond wish list"" WATCHES : BEAUTIFUL WOMEN : Which it has.. and is nice that it is not a sleazy portrayal. BAD GUYS : Should induce mild fear and depravity.Skyfall is beautifully artsy in parts but its not the bond i have grown to love . I want to spend the night in the cinema dreaming of flash cars, nice suits, and ass kicking abilities at everything. I recognise that it was a homage to bond of the last 50 years .. But every bond has a formula which makes him ""bond"" This also feels like a reinventing of an older genre. I hope this is not the case as with some films of recent years... Eg: Batman series which really needed it and turned out to be excellent films.For me ""bond"" was reinvented with Casino Royale which is head and shoulders above Skyfall in the bond series and i would rate that as the best bond every made .""where is the bond i love gone?""",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Absolutely Brilliant.,"James Bond celebrates his anniversary in possibly the best fashion imaginable. Everything from the story, the acting and the action scenes were just superb, and the time flew by when watching it.First of all, the story. Since it's the first Bond film not to be based on a novel, it gave the series a chance to change its style, and this story definitely shows this. The days of crazed billionaires taking over the world with nuclear weaponry is gone. The film is based on a psychopath looking for revenge. No complex story, no bundles of characters chucked at us, just simple revenge. And it works oh so well.Secondly, the acting. Thesis probably Daniel Craig's finest performance as 007, and almost makes 'Casino Royale' a distant memory. In my opinion, he's still second best to Sean Connery, but all that I'm sure will change shortly. The other M16 characters also play their part. Judi Dench's performance was brilliant and passionate, and newcomers Ralph Feinnes, Naiome Harris and Ben Whishaw in particular were equally superb. And Javier Bardem? One of the best Bond villains ever, and he gives a performance almost reminiscent of Heath Ledger in 'The Dark Knight'. It was a joy to watch him play Silva.Finally, the action scenes. Everything from the opening scene to the subway to the end was all so smoothly put together, it was a great thrill ride.Oh, and the theme song? Best ever.Overall: 10/10, best Bond to date, go and watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
I was afraid...,"...very afraid that all the hype would be just that. From the opening scene in Turkey, to the wonderful theme song, sung and written by Adele, to the vulnerability of both Bond and M, (and the incredible acting by Daniel Craig and Judi Dench), to the many nods and references to past Bonds (which had me laughing aloud, or squealing like a giddy schoolgirl), to the deliciously creepy and insane villain played brilliantly by Xavier Bardem, this is probably going to end up being my favourite Bond film of all, and I have seen every one of them at least once.If you want OTT gadgets, exotic locations, and a parody of a 007, then go stick on a DVD of Moore or Brosnan and leave the good stuff to us who love the gritty realism.Oh, and I can't have been the only person of an age with Bond who was thinking exactly the same thing when he met Q - lol!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
It was a nice touch adding the roots to the equation.,"I would say that the movie was a nine but there were a few flaws. What I enjoyed about the movie was that for the first time, the movie was entirely about Bond and M and the past of them. How a past villain shows up and they go to Bond's home and how they prepare the finale with it. I think the movie's plot really fitted the finale. In the beginning, I thought to myself, what the ef, is this a Bond movie? It's so not clear.But as the movie carries on, you see that they added something new this time, making it less of a Bond and a girl thing and more of a Bond thing.I also liked the acting of Q. I think he was picked out very well and I really liked his character as he played. And Javier Bardem puts on quite and act.What I didn't like was, the plot was apparently supposed to be about Bond's past. That wasn't so clear. Throughout the movie, there are blank spots. Like they wanted to keep it thrilling and not so much drama but there are blank points. That's the only flaw that I see. Like they start something in the beginning and for the rest of the movie, it just turns to catching the person who did it and nothing about the action.But the locations were well-chosen and used. I especially liked Macau because it gave a classic Bond scene.I think the movie was quite fine and actually it was amazing. And you should totally go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Why turn a good Bond into a mediocre Batman?,"There is no denying Skyfall tries really hard to take Bond back to its roots. The problem is it lacks the talent that made the Bonds of old possible. The problems start with the title song which sounds like a mash up of previous forgettable Bond songs, with Adele singing at times embarrassingly off-key. Daniel Craig looks like he is really really tired of the character. It doesn't look just like Bond being tired of being Bond, it actually looks like Daniel Craig is tired of being Bond. He is simply going through the motions. He is not alone, by the way. Judy Dench looks like she can't wait to get it over with. I appreciate she is having difficulty acting with failing eyesight (there is a very nice pun about it in the movie), but it's still no excuse. Naomi Harris is just terrible and is simply miscast. I don't understand all the fuss about Javier Bardem's performance either. His first meeting with Bond is poorly scripted and fails to deliver to the potential it holds. From that point on it just gets worse. Lastly, why turn Bond into Batman? Family castle, a butler (kind of), the car (a nice blast from the past but also a Batman touch) and so on, and of course - the scene which was part of the trailer, with Bond looking over London from a rooftop. Bottom line - it was kind of fun, but doesn't live up to the hype. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
After a lengthy absence Bond is back with a vengeance!,"After I first watched this film I felt it was a very good Bond film, but I was unsure just where to place it in the three Daniel Craig Bond films. Initially, I was disappointed by the fact the organization set up in the previous two films was not mentioned or used. However, the more I thought about this Bond film, the more apparent it became that this was indeed Craig's finest Bond movie yet. This is due to the increased screen time of M played once again by Judi Dench and this film basically revolves around her character as it is a bit of a farewell film for her. Sure, the organization was not used this time, but after Dr. No and From Russia with Love Spetre was given a film off for Goldfinger. So I can see them once again having James Bond face off against this mysterious group again in the next film. So basically this Bond movie was great with great action which is usually a given and an emotionally charged ending that was not expected.The film has Bond trying to chase down a man who has vital information in his possession. Suffice to say, this Bond movie has one heck of a chase right from the get go. Unfortunately, Bond is nearly killed right from the get go as well as he is hit by friendly fire. He later turns up, but not before the information he failed to retrieve is used to attack MI6 headquarters. Someone has a grudge against M, and James Bond is on the case to track them down. He has to go to the Orient where he discovers a former 00 agent is the cause for the turmoil, this man is not what he appears to be as he is cold and calculating to the extreme. Bond soon uses M as bait as he takes her to his old family home, ""Skyfall"". There he will face off against this madman hellbent on revenge against M.If I were to have a complaint about this one, it is the villain. He is good, but they do not develop him quite enough. He needs more screen time as Javier Bardem does a good job with the relatively small amount of screen time this villain receives. However, that is about the only complaint I can muster against this film. I loved how they brought back two staple characters from the movies prior to the Daniel Craig films, and while Judi Dench will be missed, I like her replacement. To me, it almost felt like the Sean Connery days as they were ending this one...and that is a good thing as Connery is my favorite Bond. Granted, Craig is close to tying him at this point.This film was amazing. At first I did not realize how good it was, but it sticks with you long after it is over unlike so many other films that just vanish from your brain a couple of hours after viewing. It was also good how Judi Dench's M had such a major role...I loved the scene with them in the classic Bond car. It is a shame it took so long for them to get Bond back on the big screen, but I am happy to report that the film was everything one expects from a James Bond film and a bit more. Hopefully, we will not have to wait four years for the next installment, and perhaps the organization set up in Quantum returns.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Two and a half hour wasted,"The movie was lacking whatever a movie has to have. The plot was a total cliché and easily predictable. To me, the 'bad' guy and his attitude was a poor counterfeiter of Joker (in Dark Night). I could not stop myself thinking about the budget allocation, where did all the money go? Probably spent on tuxedos and suits otherwise there was no breathtaking costly scene or something. The voice quality was horrible, I had to stick out my ears because not everyone is spoon eared like James Bond.All in all, it was not entertaining, nor a thriller, rather I felt it was a set-up to kill my hours and take my money.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond grows up,"Seems James Bond, aka 007, ain't quite as young and as spry as he used to be. After years of chasing the bad guys and suffering one too many injuries and wounds on the job, the world's premier secret agent is beginning to feel his age.In this outing, a noticeably creakier Bond goes in pursuit of an ex-agent who's targeting MI6 and particularly its chief, M, for wrongs he believes he's suffered at their hands.In addition to providing a more relatable Bond - replete with autobiographical back story - and M, ""SkyFall"" is that rare action movie that actually finds time to probe some surprisingly heady themes amid all the obligatory shootouts and chase scenes (which are excellent, by the way, especially the tour de force opening scene).For instance, the script ponders whether MI6's old-school reliance on secret agents has become a hopelessly antiquated business model for a world in which technology has begun to replace time-consuming footwork and in which the enemy is no longer out in the open but operating in the shadows.The movie also questions M's practice of cutting loose her most loyal and valued agents (Bond included) - essentially treating them as disposable assets - when a greater goal is to be achieved through their sacrifice.The dialogue between Daniel Craig as Bond and Judi Dench as M is some of the best in the whole Bond series, and there is a genuine connection between the two individuals who, although they're working for the same team, often seem more like adversaries than allies.""Skyfall"" also provides us with one of the most effective villains we've come across in quite awhile, in the person of Javier Bardem as the former operative who's decided to exact his revenge on the people and the organization that he feels have done him wrong.Director Sam Raimi even manages to achieve some genuine lyricism in his direction, something one almost never finds in an action film.It seems to me that the Bond franchise has really upped its game since Craig hopped aboard in 2006's ""Casino Royale"" (despite the stumble of ""Quantum of Solace""). Happily, ""Skyfall"" restores that upward trajectory.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Thoroughily enjoyable Bond outing only a little let down by Mendes' direction,"Daniel Craig and Ian Flemming's great James Bond character are always worth spending time with - both for the adventure of seeing where this 50 year old franchise can go next and the joy of seeing subtle acting in a very unsubtle genre. One notices however, after enjoying a couple hours of solid escapist adventure including both touching transitions (a great character exiting the series given a meaty role on the way out!) and smile inducing re-introductions of minor iconic characters (it's clear THIS Moneypenny is going to have more to do in future films even if the classic Aston Martin may not!), that by the next day between the standard set pieces (the thrilling chases, the smooth erotic encounters and the lavishly filmed travelogues) there seems to be a certain lack in the connective tissue holding director Sam Mendes' story telling together.Yes, we do have a new villain who has freshly creepy kinks to offer, and a few jokes all too parsimoniously doled out, but neither the kink nor the comedy get enough screen time (or have the impact to FEEL like they have enough screen time) to fully satisfy! The great first challenging encounter between Craig and Bardem seems particularly shortchanged (even though it contains the movie's most memorable line, ""what makes you think it's my first time?""), and the ""Hannibal Lecter"" style transitional confinement scene is simply a time waster, but any film which can have the fun this one does with a pair of komodo dragons and a throw-away line about ""the circle of life"" is not so very far off the track with which the series has always bonded with its audience, and there are other delightful surprises as well (I defy anyone to *recognize* Albert Finney in his sublime turn at the family estate which gives the film its title).This is a smooth enjoyable Bond from the superlative opening credits (among the best in the series so far) to the final rooftop passing of the ""inheritance"", neither shaken nor stirring, but a worthy addition to the series and pointing the way to potential greatness still to come. ""Rebooting"" an adventure series which had gotten the not entirely deserved reputation of being a Cold War creation (only FROM Russia WITH LOVE really went there) into a Post-Cold War environment where the nature of the threats have evolved is not a bad thing - even when copycats from Helm to Bourne to all the earlier Bond incarnations makes keeping ideas and visuals fresh difficult. Ben Whishaw's new ""Q"" offers impressive potential if we can take his unfortunate assertion that ""we don't go in for that sort of thing any more"" as mere hyperbole and something the DEPARTMENT will back off of when they see the potential for the sort of ""toys"" his kind are good at - particularly if interacting with the fascinatingly flawed Naomie Harris' character, Eve, and while the initial introduction of Ralph Fiennes here was none too smooth until the exciting scene in the Committee Hearing Room, there is great potential to be mined in his persona as well.It is easy to note that Sam Mendes is a wildly uneven director in his stage work - sometimes brilliant, sometimes simply misguided - and he shows the full range of that unevenness in this film. Two of the important new ""Bond women,"" Bérénice Marlohe as a supposedly frightened adversary and Helen McCrory as an aggressive MP are essentially wasted in his apparent effort not to be ""politically incorrect"" (to do a Bond film is to free yourself from such concerns unless you can honor them with *humor*). Nevertheless, he gets the broad sweep of the film right and if he returns for another go in the series, one can expect the ride will be smoother and the ""highs"" of comfort, kink and comedy even higher. I look forward to it - or ANY film in which Daniel Craig or Dame Judi Dench hold forth.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Overwhelming and breathtaking entry in which Bond/Daniel Craig contends a heinous and revenger enemy, Javier Bardem","Nice installment in James Bond series in which 007 : Daniel Craig, faces off a nasty, ominous MI6 ex-agent: Javier Bardem who has bloody terrorist purports .

As a hard drive is robbed containing names and whereabouts of undercover agents, subsequently they are murdered one by one. Then MI6 headquarter is under attack and while M: Judi Dench receives mysterious messages from a suspicious ex-agent. Along the way 007's loyalty to M is tested when past happenings are brought to actual life. After that, James Bond sets out in pursuit to Shanghai to destroy the threat and he finds many surprises.A recent and nail-biting entry and once again the violent and hunk Daniel Craig/James Bond, as he carries out a two-fisted and tough acting, as usual. His nemesis very well played by Javier Bardem as an extremely cunning and sinister ex-agent named Raoul Silva who will stop at nothing to execute his threats, no matter how personal the cost. Both of whom give good interpretations and playing a strong battle of wits.

Another really impressive feat here is the soundtrack.Thomas Newman does a great job,with this movie and so does Adele with her song of the same name.Even the sound effects are near perfect.

Good action movie that almost feels like a Bond flick. Almost.,"It still barely feels like Bond, but this is still the best of the latest generation bunch and the best since the 1995 gem Goldeneye.Skyfall borrows from this recurring theme of cinema of taking well-known franchises and adding this dark reboot twist to give it a fresh perspective while also throwing some old-school flavor into it. The technique might be a bit odd, since this already happened in Casino Royale. Behind the camera is indie darling Sam Mendes, an accomplished director, to add some visual flair and technique to a film series that is mysteriously devoid of good directors and cinematographers. And Mendes' direction not only enhances the exotic film locations and exquisite action sequences, but also manages to hide most of the errors and setbacks behind the movie.The movie immediately takes off from the getgo, revealing the conflict within the first minute, and leading to an extended action/chase sequence that rivals among the best Bond has ever been involved in. And then we get taken by one of the better title sequences in recent memory featuring another strong Adele performance. How on earth was this film going to maintain the momentum of the first twenty minutes? Here's a little hint: it barely does.Daniel Craig has gotten a lot of criticism from the old-school Bond fans about his portrayal, and his performance here will not dwell the flames. That being said, Craig in his third round as the famed hero displays that he is indeed able to pull the charm, humor, sophistication, and suave of the other Bonds----if the writing staff can ever let him. But the writers and producers are hellbent on making sure that the Connery/Moore James Bond never makes its way back into the big screen.And this is where the movie mildly stumbles, not in directing or acting, but in the writing department. Composed by a three-person team, the plot never allows for us to get too comfortable with any of the supporting characters; from the Bond girls to not even the main villain—whom doesn't even show up in the first act (Despite it being brilliantly done by Javier Bardem, even if his character becomes extremely uneven towards the end). The final third inexplicably treads into prologue territory, when it could have been used earlier when the agency was in disarray as the conflict elevates when the entire cast of protagonists are under attack. And lastly, they still fail to give the movie the special James Bond touch, that little catalyst that for decades has separated itself from the usual action movie fare.Skyfall is part of the biggest enigma I face in cinema today: am I willing to accept this new direction of James Bond and his more brutal, dark, but more realistic look? Or should I yearn for the old-school days when it was hapless escapism that can hide any ridiculousness or stupidity with layers of charm, sexiness, and classy adult fun? These recent Bonds have been done with plenty of effort and quality, but what gets sacrificed is the little nitty-gritty sparks that made James Bond an icon in the first place. So I'm torn.In the meantime, I will accept Skyfall as a good, perfectly-directed action movie that survives a third act flounder and some questionable writing and hangs on as the best Bond since Pierce Brosnan.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Best action, best villain, best film","'Skyfall' is the third Bond film starring Daniel Craig – it also marks the 50th anniversary of James Bond in cinema. There are lots of delightful little old references to classic Bond films with lots of old gadgets, gags, cars and theme song.The script is well-written; it's an interesting story focusing more on M than Bond. It can be a bit confusing because it's moving at such as fast pace but it does all make sense and you don't struggle to keep up with it. Like 'Casino Royale', it began with a great action sequence and an even greater title sequence. The middle of the film is interesting and there is a decent amount of gripping classic Bond scenes but at some points it can lose momentum and lag a bit. However, the ending is brilliant with a fantastic finishing action sequence and a great last scene to make us all look forward to Bond 24.The acting is very good; Daniel Craig returns as Bond and provides the same quality of performance as he brought in the past two films. Judi Dench features a lot more in this film and gives a great performance. Bond girls Naomi Harris and Berenice Marlohe are great and are probably the best of the Craig series so far. However, Bond villain Javier Bardem definitely stole the show; he gave a fantastic performance and was genuinely creepy. He may be type-cast after fantastic performances in this and in 'No Country for Old Men' but he fully deserves to be up there with the best Bond villains. The only problem was that he simply wasn't in it enough!Overall, this is a fantastic film and has already been called one of the best Bond films ever. It's the first recent Bond film that hasn't tried to be like a Bourne film so hopefully the three planned future Bond films will take heed of this. A truly excellent film that everyone should see, a great piece of cinema that could even get awards attention due to both the performances and the script.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Sky-fall from grace.,"This 007 movie has a little more action than Quantum of Solace, where James Bond (Daniel Craig) inadvertently exposes secret agents from around the world after a botched mission, causing M (Judi Dench) to relocate MI6. With the agency compromised, M can only rely on Bond to crack the case and follow the trail of perpetrator Silva (Javier Bardem), who has a personal and lethal mission of his own.The opening sequence was well done, with the very nice ""Skyfall"" song sung by Adele capturing the majesty, charm and mystery of all the intro songs from previous 007 movies, with the exception of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace; this is a great throwback to Bond's heyday. My favorite part is when Bond and M hop into his Ashton Martin and speeds off, where the classic Bond theme plays in the background. It was also nice to see the introduction of Q (Ben Whishaw), but I wish he would have resembled the classic Q more rather than a computer nerd who looks like he was fresh out of college. And, Javier Bardem makes a love-to-root-against villain, sending Bond on a wild and thrilling chase around the country.Like the previous two Bond films starring Craig, this movie lacks the charm, suaveness, substance and humor you've come to recognize and love from the earlier 007 movies. This film's atmosphere and storyline were dark, which deviates to the more light-hearted Bond movies of the 70s and 80s. In addition, the time-line for this and the previous two films are supposed to be set before the events of the pre-Craig movies; however, this was not explained very well (i.e., as good of an actress Judi Dench is, they should have had a different actor/actress portray M since she was also in the Pierce Brosnon movies, which are set after the events of Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall). The story itself wasn't too appealing.Overall, not one of the better Bond films. It's just another action flick with some neat special effects, but minus the 007 flavor.Grade C",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
An Incredible Film,"Skyfall, the latest 007 film, is an incredible film and a nonstop thrill ride. It arrives on 50 years after, Connery first entered as Bond in Doctor No. It is a fantastic film, gifted with a superb plot, exciting action, and phenomenal acting. Its theme, of loyal and betrayal are intense and helped created a film which is epic in scope, but one that feels intensely personal.The opening sequence in exotic Istanbul sets the tone for the film. In it Bond and Eve, a fellow MI6 agent, pursue a target who has stolen a encrypted flash drive containing information vital to MI6 and western intelligence in general. The exciting chase takes place on the streets of Istanbul, along with the roofs. It is brilliantly choreographed as Bond transitions from car, to motorcycle, and finishes in a life or death struggle atop a moving train. In the end disaster occurs. M orders Eve to take a risky shot, which results in Bond being shot and falling 50 feet from a bridge into deep water to a presumed death. The shot of Bond falling is an intense image, even if you have seen the trailer, it is shocking and sets the tone for the rest of the film.The titles sequence is another masterfully made part of the film. It is filled with omens an images of death such as skulls, grave, and deadly weapons. A sequence in a hall of mirrors where Bond shoots his reflection and one where Bond shoots his shadow are brilliant and artful. Throughout the sequence, Adele's theme song leaves us sitting on the edge of our seat. It is one of the few title sequences I am sure I will watch all the way through when Skyfall makes its way to DVD.The plot of the film is excellent. MI6 falls under attack from a cyber terrorist, Rauol Silva, who is a figure from M's past. M's leadership of the agency is called into question just as Silva executes a daring plot, using his computer skills to set off a Bond in the MI6 headquarters. One of the films most powerful images is M standing solemnly in a room filled with coffins covered with Union Jacks. Bond returns to service out of loyalty to M, but the Bond that comes back is different from the one who left. No longer clean shave, Bond's hands shake when he fires a gun, and he struggles physically and mentally to recover from the experiences he has been through. Though she is not sure of Bond's readiness, M sends her to find Silva. The relationship between M and Bond is deeper that ever before as secrets from her past come back to haunt her and MI6. The mission is a dangerous one, with twists and turns a plenty, but it grabs hold of you and never lets go.The acting in this film is incredible. Daniel Craig owns the screen as Bond. He shows us the strengths and weakness of a complex character. He also has great chemistry with the other actors and he brings more banter to the part than in his other two outings. Judi Dench is magnificent as M. Though she has always been formidable in the role, she raises the bar again. She displays the toughness of a boss, willing to sacrifice her agents to achieve her goals, yet she also shows the vulnerability of a character whose time maybe coming to end. No one shines brighter in Skyfall than Javier Bardem who plays the villain with a giddy flamboyance but never seems ridiculous. Looking truly unique with his blonde hairdo, Bardem creates a complex villain, one who is sure to take his place among the all time bond greats. His entrance in the film, in which he strides towards a tied up Bond while relating a story about rats eating each other, is mesmerizing. He brings back suave to the Bond villain, which Quantum sorely lacked. Yet he is also able to appear creepy and darkly menacing. He is a mix of new villains and old. He is a cyber terrorist yet he is ruthless and willing to pull the trigger, as he brutally shows Bond. The rest of the supporting cast is incredible.The complex themes of loyalty and betrayal helped make the film relevant and powerful. In addition, Mendes asks the bold question of whether M and Bond are relevant any longer. Yet the incredible story and intense action prove that Bond isn't going anywhere and that perhaps his new adventures can match his old ones. Well done 007. Nobody does it better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Skyfall -Very Good!!  As a Bond Film?? - Let me think,"Lets start of with the very important fact which according to me is the deciding factor why people loved this movie or rejected it outrightly, which is the story not being written by Ian Fleming and yes it becomes very evident when you watch this film. The film is not based on the novel creating that inability to differentiate between the Bond legacy and other espionage based series like Mission Impossible or Bourne series and that is where i am unable to find that soul of Bond( which for me is very crucial). The movie starts of huge and goes well humongous till the interval. However, it is after that when i felt the entire scale of presentation just dropped down to ""just another spy movie"" There are movie lovers, me and Bond fans who are appreciating the new presentation of Bond as more of a ruthless killer than a handsome guy with expensive gadgets, who in the recent episodes have neither of them. Everyone will certainly accept it (the box office opening of Skyfall and current IMDb rating have made it evident) To come to the finer aspects of film, this one also opens with a very promising chase scene like its previous two parts. However, my favorite yet remains from the first one, Casino Royale, because of more realistic feel because of free running. Yes, Daniel Craig justifies the role of James Bond and Judi Dench who probably has the most screen time in this part (if i am not wrong) delivers a great performance. Javier Bardem as Silva is really good considering his character design and appears scarily strong. The story has decent action and fair amount of twists. My favorite piece in the film is the first conversation between Bond and Silva. And an extra point for the locations chosen for the film.So if i have to rate this movie as a stand alone spy film, i would give it a 9 on 10. But since its a part of Bond legacy and yet a part of it was promising i have rated it accordingly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Derivative Drivel,"My husband and I saw this so-called Bond film, and while we both appreciate Daniel Craig as an actor, we do not think he is James Bond in any way. We adore Judi Dench and thought she was great, and we are sorry to see her go. I for one was not so sure that the fine actor Ralph Fiennes is a good substitute for her. Javier Bardem was suitably menacing as the villain. In this film there were way too many echoes of The Bourne Identity and Jason Bourne, which is too bad because because that Bourne series is much more clever and innovative overall, but this film seemed like ""The Boring Identity"" to us. While the ending was somewhat spectacular, we felt that the whole Skyfall back story was not very well done. It looked like Wuthering Heights. We were amused at least to see Voldemort and Mrs. Malfoy on a political panel together!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond at his best in the new era.,"As a fan of Bonds such Dalton and Connery, I was slightly apprehensive about the reintroduction of 'gags' and humour. It's such a relief to see all that stuff well balanced and not awkwardly shoehorned into scenes.It's pretty clear that the aim was to crank up the IQ level of the film's script and style. Sam Mendes, Roger Deakins and John Logan all pulled it off perfectly. It's so satisfying to have a Bond film with a central theme running from start to finish (unlike QoS – I actually got bored after the fifth explosion) – the whole idea of Bond and M being tied to past events. I see it as an evolution to a more ""thinking man's"" Bond. Just the mere presence of Ralph Fiennes gives the film an additional intensity and class.I also love how the film promotes Britishness in a contemporary, Spooks-eque way without the usual flag-waving nonsense – from cinematography to the choice of locations. There is something cool about watching a black Range Rover cruising across the River Thames under grey skies with Thomas Newman's score pumping in the background. It's all so subtle and yet so informative. Very Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.For Bond nerds, it's all there - girls, action and cars... in addition, a huge dose of great filmmaking, dialogue, and script. Craig and Mendes together have made a traditional and classy Bond. Love!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A beautiful addition to the Bond series,"When I first saw the lineup for the most recent addition to the James Bond series, my expectations were rather high. A cast and crew compiled out of my favorite films. I will get to the obvious actors in a minute, but first I want to mention the talent behind the camera. Skyfall director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, best director) has done a tremendous job in creating a film, which I believe belongs among the top Bond films of all time. Mendes' Bond is well directed in the traditional sense: the action, chases, near-death escapes, sexuality, old-school British class, and subtle humor all mix well into a Skyfall martini—shaken, not stirred.While Mendes certainly is the brains behind this recent Bond success, cinematographer Roger Deakins is the eyes. The film is beautifully shot, to say the least. There is no way I can really capture Deakins' beautiful use of color, lighting, shadow, and silhouette throughout this film without actually showing it to you. So, here is my one plug, even if you are not a fan of the Bond series go see this film. It is beautiful and well shot film.I knew that Daniel Craig had performed well in his first two Bond films, showing much respect to the long-standing tradition of Bond, but at the age of 44 it was hard to believe Craig's performance would be fully up to par. I was wrong. Craig gave this film his all and he delivered another performance worth noticing. (And apparently he has more to give with the announcement of Bonds 24 & 25 in the near future.) Craig's performance has the drive and determination of a true action film star combined with the wittiness and high-class demeanor we've come to expect from Bond. But when I saw that Javier Bardem would be playing across from Bond, I knew this would be a special role for Craig.It's not easy squaring up against a man whose screen presence is as strong as Javier Bardem. Bardem's opening shot, a slow stroll through a long shot while delivering a lengthy discourse to a tied up Agent 007, makes you cringe and smile at the same time. Bardem's screen presence is one that always confuses me. Not confusion in the sense that his acting is poor, but quite the opposite. Maybe it's the slightly detectable accent through his well-articulated English. Or maybe it's the look in his eyes that pulls you in, traps you, and deceives you into believing that Bardem is the real thing. In the film Bardem portrays Silva, an ex-MI6 agent who is using computer hacking skills as a sort of cyber-terrorism. According to the story, Bond and Silva were MI6's best of the best, but Silva was betrayed and has come back for vengeance. Bardem's character is cranial; not a chaotic criminal running wild with no plan. He is smart, conniving, and witty—with some subtly homoerotic undertones that add a unique twist to the sexuality we expect to find in Bond films. Bardem's performance in Skyfall is by far the best villainous role he has played since his work with the Coens in No Country for Old Men, for which he won Best Supporting Actor in 2008.Judi Dench returns for her seventh Bond appearance as the beloved M and does not disappoint. Dench is the definition of a strong, female character and will stop at nothing until her job is done. Ben Whishaw makes his first appearance in the Bond series as Q, the technologically savvy head of Britain's defense division. Whishaw's appearance in the film makes it the first time that Q has been portrayed as younger than Bond, a decision that I believe is a sign of the times. Whishaw's Q is a Zuckerberg-like fellow with an aura of nerdy wrapped around a slightly stylish young boy. While it certainly is a change from the Q that the late Desmond Llewelyn portrayed for most of the Bond films, Whishaw seems to hold his own in Skyfall. And lastly, Skyfall's themesong, which was written and recorded by British vocal sensation Adele, is a beautiful track that reminds the audience of the roots of Bond in the 1960s.Overall, I would give this film an 8.9/10. While I found many sequences to be easily predictable, as most Bond films are, I was still happy with film as a whole. Craig and Bardem go back and forth in a battle for control throughout the film in a beautifully crafted way. Mendes' direction and Deakins' cinematography certainly add to the beauty of the film and high standards of the Bond legacy. The best Bond film I have seen in a while and what I hope to be a new standard for the quality we will see in Bond 24 & Bond 25.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Incredibly well directed, structured Bond Movie, with a dark, gripping opening & final act","Bond movies have been my favorites, not only because they're exciting and have huge action set pieces, but because the screen play is fantastic, the directors are veterans, and they all deeply explore the vivid, often dark world of Agent 007. He is human, which is a point brought out very very well in the previous 3 installments, and justified by Daniel Craig's stellar performances.The opening act is great, and sets the tone for the entire film. The opening credits were incredible. What is great is that Daniel Craig has now perfectly understood his character. He is human, but this time, he isn't too emotional or sulking about it. He is tough, and has M's confidence. He is in his best act.M is the one who is in focus here. And Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) who stuns everyone with a chilling performance. The deserted island set is incredibly beautiful, and the neon lit Shanghai building in which a major fight sequence takes place, is one of the most stunning work of cinematography in any bond movie so far.In the last half hour, Bardem steals the show with his underground train wrecking, and maniacal ways at the 'Skyfall' palace. However, I say this again, Daniel Craig isn't weak, or a wreck this time. He knows his ways. Agent 007 is a smart and strong character, and he does what his expected of him by fighting his way extremely well, and by protecting M till the end, in a very charismatic way, which was a pleasure to watch.So what makes a bond film a great one? A mad villain, a well-knit story, an incredible opening sequence, an intense final act, bond's handy fist work, explosions, some smart gadgets, a huge train wreck, and some of the best beautiful cinematography. 'Skyfall' has it all.One of the best movies of the year. If good action movies are your fare, you cannot miss out on 'Skyfall'!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Not even close to cigar,"I felt like Homer Simpson during this movie, I thought I was so close to making it across the gorge (on my metaphorical skateboard) but now after having my second thought I find myself suddenly plunging once again to the depths of cinematic failure and disappointment; Doh! I mean when did both Bond and his villains suddenly become such apron clutching delinquents who start bed wetting the moment they find out Santa isn't real?My real problem with the movie was predictability. Right from the outset the story had holes wider than the pretty boy inmate we all love and like my friend with OCD you knew what would happened next. The story goes from capturing a hard drive to Bond on vacation to a terrorist plot to protecting M – all plot lines which were tossed aside like last night's left overs! Peppered with poor attempts at being techy (sorry Sheldon, Raj, Howard and Lenard), gloomy shots of a London summer and some old Scottish fart living in the shadows I was pretty bored for much of it. And we all knew he didn't pass the tests! Off course the baddie escapes his Hannibal lecter prison cage! Obviously ""years of planning"" is never enough (the bad guy still gets it wrong)! 'Woman in shower' always equals 'Bond infiltrating unthreateningly from behind' (I always get a squeal and a slap when I try), I mean bond is like a fungal nail infection – it never really dies, so stop trying to convince us he has!Everyone who watches bond watches it for 3 reasons: 1) the bond girl 2) the larger than life eccentric villain and 3) gadgets. This movie really had none of these! It's sad that they actually make a point of being gadget-less! What happen to the good ol' days when Bond always ended in bed with the girl? Where are the villains who want to take over the world, start WW3, have a satellite sun ray gun thingy, metal teeth, killer hats and a fluffy pussy (cat)? Instead we have to put up with a whiny, homo-erotic, Boris Johnson lookalike who has a fetish for computers (is that supposed be Mendes' attempt at bringing Bond into the 21st century?) and likens himself to a rat – and boy does he have mummy issues...I guess if you look at this film as a memento to the 50 years of Bond it actually does okay. The old school Bond cheese always makes me smile, the endless references to the old movies, the half-baked desperately intertwined story lines (from old Bonds) and the return of a certain iconic gadget we all loved and wanted to one day own (once we'd grown up and had enough money) do give it a nostalgic feel and made me want to go home and start an old school Bond marathon.All in all I think this movie had the ingredients for being something special, instead it's special like how you tell the dumb kid in class that he's ""special"". The nostalgia was great but the plot holes and 'M for mother' feel in the movie left me bewildered like the armless man with a spare watchBy the way, where did that hard drive go?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Brilliant Tribute to 50 Years of Bond!,"Thrilling, Action-Packed, Brilliantly Acted and Directed topped off with witty dialogues, Skyfall is probably as good as a total action-packed thriller can get and does justice to a Bond Movie and highly benefits from the great portrayel by Daniel Craig and a brilliant performance by Javier Bardem as the villain, and its topped off by some great direction from Sam Mendes and brilliant visually thrilling sequences.So The Story based on the characters created by Ian Fleming and written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan, is about MI6 agents James Bond and his adventures as 007. In this movie, he is tested to save M(Judi Dench) from a highly brilliant maniac former agent Silva(Javier Bardem), who is adamant to kill M for betraying him and kicking him out of the MI6. Bond must catch and kill Silva before he does more mayhem to the MI6.The Acting by the cast as a whole is quite great and all of them have done a decent job in their respective roles in the movie. Daniel Craig is great as ever as James Bond and he can really play the character convincingly and does again so with his style and he has everything that is needed to be Bond. Jarvier Bardem for me stole the light in this movie as the villain Silva, and he can be really menacing when he is in a villain role, and he does absolutely perfectly here as well as the brilliant maniac who is adamant to kill M. Ralph Fiennes who played Gareth Mallory in this movie did not have many screen time in this one but he is a brilliant actor and did a convincing job. Judi Dench had a big role in this movie and her great acting skills were proved here as M. The rest of the cast also portrayed their roles very well and did a convincing job.Sam Mendes is a brilliant director and he makes a brilliant Bond movie which is the best in many years, and his handling and picking of the cast was great as he controlled everyone brilliantly, and he also put all the other elements of this action-packed movie brilliantly and he synchronised all the sequences of this movie brilliantly with all the visual effects, the music and also the witty dialogues throughout the movie and Daniel Craig and the rest of the actors also benefited from him.The Story in this movie was a great one for Bond movie lovers and also for Action movie lovers and it also consisted of all the things a great Bond movie needs and the great witty dialogues topped it all off. The Cinematography in this movie i thought was top class and all the places in the movie are displayed brilliantly and the scenery's and places shown in the movie are visually pleasing. The Cinematographer Roger Deakins has done a great job with the cinematography of this movie and it contributed very well in the movie.The Music which is by Thomas Newman is top class as he sychronises his great thrilling music with all the action packed sequences brilliantly and it keeps the movie from getting dull and keeps the audience glued in the movie and the Song by Adele in the movie is also excellent and its a great contribution to the movie.Finally, I really liked the movie from the start till the end and its a great one for Bond Lovers and Action lovers too and its backed up with great stuff from all the elements that is needed in this type of a movie and it can be enjoyed by any movie/bond lovers.My Rating: 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Was so looking forward to this!!!!!,"Yes I was really looking forward to this, Daniel Craig is my favourite Bond and Casino Royale is my favourite Bond film but I came out of the cinema disappointed, maybe I expected to much? I am a massive Bond fan and really wanted SKYFALL to be the best ever but it just wasn't, it didn't feel like a Bond film, it felt disjointed and almost like it had been done on the cheap, the ending was a let down and would of been more at home on the set of A Team! this is the first time I've wrote a review as you can probably tell but I felt compelled to do so, I just hope the next installment of Bond will be better and we don't have to wait so long for it!!!!!!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Largely Really Bad,"First off I would like to state I am a big fan of James Bond films, Goldeneye and Goldfinger are the two best one's in my opinion, and Casino Royale was very good also. Having said that, this film was so bad that I actually walked out of the cinema at the end and vowed to not watch the next one, not out of spite, but because I think it will be just as bad.This is the worst bond film that was ever made, I didn't like Quantam of Solace but at least it had some entertaining action scenes. I actually created this account like some other authors on here, just to express my distaste at such a bad film.The positives: Daniel Craig was an excellent actor in this and did a great job. I thought the new Q actor in the film was good, the bond girl (if there was one) was good for the 15 - 20 minutes that she was actually in the film for before disappointingly being killed. Judi Dench also put in another fine performance.The negatives: Almost everything else was terrible. The plot was weak and disjointed. Naomi Harris may have been good in other things (I remember her doing a fairly good job in 28 days), but was truly awful in this. It would be hard to imagine anyone in the future ever doing a worse job of MoneyPenny.MoneyPenny is supposed to be a secretary that is usually flirtatious, naive, fairly attractive and have a very small role. Instead she opted to take centre stage as some kind of secret agent, who attempted to be a spitting image James Bond in just about everything she did. I personally did not think she was attractive, but I would understand if anyone disagreed with me on that. Nevertheless she was not right for the part (you couldn't have picked anyone worse), and the worst worst thing about it is she is almost certainly going to be in the next one.There was no chemistry between bond and any characters in this (except Judy Dench for a short time). And all the things about James Bond we are not supposed to ever know, are supposed to have almost all solved.This film had 0 originality in it also. It was so unoriginal that I might as well have paid to watch snippits of all the films it had ripped off (I would have enjoyed watching that so much more!). I could almost name in every scene which film the scene had ripped off.I am absolutely startled that any reviewer could consider giving this above 5 stars. And why there were so many positive critics about this. I usually love most films more than most people, but this was terrible.After this criticism it is only fair that I say what could have been done better. Bear in mind, that I am not a producer so what could be done to make a great James Bond is a little beyond my pay grade.1. A bond girl who actually lives for at least most of the film, and has some chemistry with someone. 2. A more original car, or at least some sort of original device in it which you would not usually get in a car (on a basic level even if it is just a electric board that resusatates your heart. 3. A better, more dramatic, more believable near death scene. 4. A better moneypenny actor and better moneypenny script & character type (this is so easy to do), and she shouldn't be in the film much at all. 5. A better car chase (again I understand why some may like the car/motorbike chase in this film), but I still think a much better one is needed. 6. Better plot - So much work is needed on this though 7. Better Villains (not another former MI6 agent), something more original. Jaws & Oddjob were brilliant, perhaps someone who previously had some association with bond to build chemistry would have worked. 8. Originality 10 fold increase at least. 9. Some elements of surprise 10. Something that gets you off the edge of your seat a bit more. Violence, Romance, Comedy, Tension or Emotion in isolation or a mix of some sort. 11. Probably a lot more things also, but that's all that is in the top of my head fresh after seeing it.1 star is a bit harsh on this film - it perhaps deserves 2/3 stars in my honest opinion. But given the budget, the critics saying: 'best bond ever', 'best Bond opening ever' and the time it took to produce this was truly awful. I also want to lower down the 8.2 star rating on here, as this is at least 5 stars to high.Apologies for any bad spelling/gramatical errors, and an apology if I upset anyone who liked MoneyPenny in the film. I'm sure Naiomi Harris is good in other things (such as 28 days), but she is not made for this role at all. I thought there was other poor acting/scriptwriting for some bodyguards for instance also.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Count To Ten,"This film is ambitious. The more I think about it the more I appreciate the real, raw emotion that was captured on screen and thrust at the audience. I don't believe any other Bond film has ever had the ability to do this; the campy, guns blazing, invincible Bond is not what a real-life Bond would be.My opinion the best opening/credit sequence of the series. One of the best Bond villains. The acting and directing couldn't be better.In terms of the tone of the James Bond series, there was only meant to be one Skyfall. And it's done brilliantly.

"""Do not expect much action, just focus on the progress.""","Apart from the good action chase in the beginning, the film will also be remembered for a great opening title sequence. There are thrilling moments every now and then. However what seems to be lacking in the entire film was that the focus at all times was not on Bond but over the past of M. Bond fans are obvious to feel betrayed when the villain is not at all bothered on a particular mission, and rather on digging the past. The sole Job of Bond in the film remained to save the reputation of the organization. Well I do consider that from all the previous mission specific films, this one was a relief being focused on a much engaging story.PROS:The performance by Javier Bardem is awesome. All major roles were performed well. The cinematography in particular was nice, compelling and makes the film a great watch. The dialogs at certain times too were humoristic, funny and preserved the wittiness of Bond. The story this time looked more authentic and did not just focus on a mindless mission in which bond eventually beats his way out. It dealt properly with the genuineness of fear caused by a villain who is as skilled as Bond. At one point it looked as if bond was the only one in the whole organization who could stop this guy. The charisma of Bardem is what drives the film in the second half.CONS:The first half was particularly spent in confusion regarding where the story is really going or whether any great action would come.

Brining old school back,"Skyfall is quite possibly, one of the best the franchise has produced so far and is most definitely the best Daniel Craig has performed in the totality of his 3 bond movies.There were so many factors making this specific bond movie outstanding and up to par even with its original bonds. Starting with the opening credits and the incredible graphics they entailed working so harmoniously with Adele's theme song ""Skyfall"" specifically made for this movie. Usually not a lot of people pay attention to the opening credits of a movie, but everyone's eyes were glued to the IMAX screen here at the Villagio Cinema in Qatar.The movie focused a lot on the story and the plot as opposed to having it too action packed and meaningless. Simultaneously the plot and the climb to the climax wasn't too twisted to the point of losing the audience. However the action scenes in the movie were by no means undermined. It was the perfect balance.The movie finally included the James Bond trademark line ""Bond, James Bond"" which was missing from the last 2 bond movies. Sam Mendes really outdid himself with ""Skyfall"".The movie' had a sense of simplicity to everything about it, resulting in an overwhelming sense of authenticity. Another successful addition to the James Bond franchise. Terrific line delivery by all actors, superb performance, directing and Camera angles to be taught. Overall the movie comes very highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A solid Bond entry,"50 years after the release of the first James Bond film, Dr. No, the world's best known spy returns for his 23rd official screen outing, and the third with Daniel Craig in the role, with Skyfall. The good news is that Skyfall is a strong entry in the Bond canon, exploring character and story material never before considered in a Bond film. The less good news is that Skyfall still manages to fall a little short of greatness, partially due to an inflated running time and saggy midsection.Skyfall opens, in standard Bond tradition, with a rousing pre-title sequence in which Bond and partner Eve (Naomie Harris) attempt to stop a list containing the identities of the British Secret Service's deep cover agents in terrorist agents from falling into the wrong hands. At the end of an energetic chase through Istanbul, Bond is accidentally shot by Eve and believed dead. He isn't, of course (now, THAT would be a real departure for a Bond film), but decides to engage in an unplanned vacation. However, when MI6 headquarters is bombed, and head M (Judi Dench) receives some ominous electronic threats, Bond returns from self- imposed exile to try to find the parties responsible. However, age and his recent injuries make his fitness for the job questionable, with Garreth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), questioning whether it is time for Bond to retire for real.With M's backing, Bond heads to Shanghai to locate the hired killer who stole the list, and the trail leads to Silva (Javier Bardem), a former MI6 agent who was turned over to the Chinese authorities by M in the past due to him operating outside of protocol, and Silva hasn't taken that lightly, leading him to engage in a personal vendetta against M. Bond must try to outwit Silva, who proves a formidable adversary on a variety of fronts, and keep him from fulfilling his mission of revenge against M.Skyfall is not your typical Bond film in a number of ways. Instead of the usual globe-trotting antics of many Bond entries, much of Skyfall unfolds in London and the countryside of the UK and the immediate neighbors. Sure there are some detours to China and Turkey, but this is the most a Bond film has been set in it's home base than I can ever remember. Skyfall also elects to engage in much more character development of Bond than most of the series. Bond finds himself put through an emotional and physical wringer, dealing with both the onset of age and the wounds generated in the line of duty. Skyfall is the first Bond outing that seems to truly exist in a post-9/11 world, with the nature of espionage and whether the decisions the leaders of those organizations have made are correct in the world as it currently is. Skyfall isn't content to just rehash the standard Bond formula, but engage in a degree of self-deconstruction of that formula as to whether it is still viable.Back in the lead for his third time, Craig brings a degree of world- weariness to the role of Bond. With a multi-day growth of greying stubble for the first half of the film, and sporting a shoulder wound from a tussle with a enemy operative, Craig truly makes it appear at the outset that Bond is ready to be put out to pasture. Once again, despite a few brief encounters with some secondary characters, Craig's Bond is also less interested in bedding the ladies than he is in taking on the bad guys in his current incarnation. In Craig's hands, Bond is largely a man of vertical, not horizontal, action.As Silva, Javier Bardem gives Skyfall the most memorable and formidable villain the series has seen in some outings. Sporting a blond wig, a number of effeminate traits (in one scene he is practically seducing Bond) and skill at verbal jousting to rival Hannibal Lecter, Bardem largely commands the screen when he is around. Silva also is a villain who isn't without a degree of method to his madness, as he challenges the modern, corrupt world we live in, introducing the idea that perhaps it is time for individuals to take matters into their own hands.Judi Dench is handed the largest role the character of M has ever received, and she makes M less of a plot device and more of a central person in Bond's world. Over Craig's entries in the series, M has been given more of a presence than in the earlier films, and her part in Skyfall represents the character at it's pinnacle. M, much like Bond, is studied with a critical eye here, forced to deal with questions of her organizations relevance in the modern world.Academy Award winning director Sam Mendes, helming his first full on action film, proves strong at staging the usual set pieces of the Bond universe, and he and cinematographer Roger Deakins craft a visually arresting look for Skyfall. At times almost monochromatic in color, Skyfall oozes craftsmanship in many of its moments. The title song, performed by Adele, is also one that hearkens back to the days of Shirley Bassey during the Connery era.Skyfall does have weaknesses, largely due to an excessive running time. Bond films have never been brief affairs, but Skyfall seems a bit padded at times, especially in it's middle to late 3rd, where the narrative slows a bit too much. And also, despite plumbing some new depths of character, Skyfall still manages to fall a little short of true emotional resonance at times, displaying all the right trappings, but still feeling a little empty.That being said, Skyfall is certainly a solid entry for James Bond, and one can only hope that whomever takes the creative reins next will build upon the strong foundations of Skyfall and make the next film truly soar.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A very good Bond film. Yes we can forget about Quantum of Solace.,"If you have been hearing the words Bond is back. My it not over hype this latest 007 flick. The last one was a let down. But not this one. A very good Bond film. Yes we can forget about Quantum of Solace.Like Casino Royal it stands on its own, but works as a great sequel. And yes Bond is back! I'm not going to spoil anything in this review. All I will say is finally we have an entertaining bad guy along with a strong plot as far as Bond films go.Is it the best bond film ever?

"Slow start, reputable ending, AMAZING Climax","Being a James Bond fan, I was looking forward to the opening of this movie. Upon the start and throughout the first hour, the normal Bond moments were enacted; high speed chases, Bond getting his butt kicked to return an ass whooping, and making out with a hot woman.But I will honestly say, the climax of this movie (to remain unmentioned in this review) was probably by far one of the most exciting and nail biting build-ups of any movie I've seen this year.The story continues with more cut-throat action and cheesy Bond cliché's gripping to an end where a lot of loose ends of 007 are tied up and it brings us to yet another end of Bond's adventure...

The opening sequence is worth the price of admission alone.,"The opening sequence before the traditional Bond credits and title song is worth the price of admission alone. This a high quality made action film. It's beautifully shot in some amazing locations, not often seen on film and features some excellent performances from Craig, Bardem (he does creepy so well, it's well creepy...), Dench and one of the Bond girls in newcomer to English language films and stunner in general, Bérénice Marlohe.I thought it dragged a bit in the middle where there was too much Bond flirting with the ladies and not enough action or suspense and the other Bond girl played by Naomie Harris irritated me. Although I found moments in the film rather amusing, in particular some gold from Judi Dench, the script was a little too cheesy, even for a Bond film, but it was a very enjoyable and fun film and the action sequences were excellent.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Equal to the hype,"I went into the movie a little skeptical because of the hype. Also, I was worried about the opening sequence they kept pitching because most car chases, chases in general, bore me. But this one was riveting, interesting. It was fantastical but just shy of over-the-top. Loved it. Adele's song and the beginning movie credits was interesting, entertaining, beautiful. Javier Bardem played the best Bond villain I've seen since the '70's. His acting was a work of art. Judy Dench was, as usual, perfect. Daniel Craig was more than eye candy, more substantial. Sam Mendes is obviously an amazing director. He was able to make even the couple of corny lines work to the movie's advantage. And the filming/editing was flawless.Those who haven't watched the old Bond movies might miss the punch of some of the really enjoyable moments, like the Aston Martin, Moneypenny, Q... I was delighted at the memories.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Mixed Bag,"Not a bad bond in the least.When compared to Quantam of Solace, this Bond seems profound and phenomenal. That being said I had some issues with the flick.For one, Craig's bond get's more broody and apathetic in each movie. While some would argue that that type of Bond reflects the Flemming Bond, I compare each Bond reincarnation to previous film versions.The direction in this movie made Craig seem ruthless and cold. It would have been suited better for a Layer Cake sequel (although that would be impossible).Some of the dialogue fell flat for me, as it was awkward and felt rushed.But what was great about this Bond was the reintroduction of classic borderline cheesy fight scene's which worked very well.TL;DR: A good flick with some odd directorial choices and writing that didn't mesh with. Lot's of fun, and a great summer rental, or download, or...... -_-",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

It took me back to some of the original films and was witty and clever.I think Sam Mendes did a good job and the characters came to life, the story was well thought out and the music was great. I reckon this is one of the best.

I Don't See Why Anybody Wouldn't Like This Movie.,"Anybody who is reading this, I would strongly suggest disregarding all bad reviews about Skyfall. This was the first Bond movie I have ever watched, and it blew me away. In fact, I went and saw it in theaters twice...twice folks. After watching such a fantastic movie I decided to buy and watch a ton of old Bond movies. All of them bored me. There were a few great parts in all of them, but for the most part, it was hard for me to make it through them. Daniel Craig is by far my favourite Bond, and probably will be unless they make Robert Downey Jr. Bond some day. Anyhow, I highly recommend this movie.

"My word is my bond and my word, what  a good Bond !","If you only read the first line of my review, heres my opinion, its fantastic, well worth your time and money, see it in IMAX though.I was a little concerned when i first heard Sam Mendes was directing the 50th Bond movie, as a similar unusual choice of director was made with Michael Apted on The World Is Not Enough.That was Pierce Brosnan's third outing as Bond and the Brosnan Bonds, i feel, deteriorated as they went along, even then Bond was still slavishly following the Goldfinger/Thunderball schematic.That rigid, moribund take on Bond culminated in Die Another Day, Bond was starting to look silly, he was becoming a parody, invisible cars were not the way forward.This was the point where it seems to me the producers realised Bond isn't about scale, rather drama and intensity.Since that realisation, they have re-cast, re-tooled and re-booted, the results have been re-markable.Daniel Craig has proved that what may seem like a questionable choice at first, can often be shown to be a wise one in the long term. In our modern times where ""reality"" is the watchword, he has, with a little help from the Bond people, brought us an abrasive edge (not seen since Connery) and emotional facet to the character, that will ensure his longevity well into the 21st century.Having loved the Bond movies as a kid, reading the books, its a pleasure to report that Commander (RNR) James Bond is reinvigorated and reporting back for duty, ma'am.Skyfall, without wanting to get too bogged down in tedious semantics, now falls within, i'd say, the three best Bond films to date.After snatching your breath away, with a hell for leather opening chase across Istanbul and a seemingly inescapable cliffhanger, the film settles down into a story where, Bond is emotionally stripped down, questions his very raison d'être and emerges triumphantly to...well i'm not going to spoil it.Javier Bardem provides a Bond villain, with one foot in the past (figuratively) and an eye on a vengeful future, he represents the flamboyance of earlier villains and the elusive spectre of the modern terrorist.Dame Judi Dench is fantastic, she even gets to shoot a gun, what more could you want ?Before the dust settles, we've visited Shanghai, the Bond family home, popped into the National Gallery to view Turner's ""The﻿ fighting Temerarie tugged to her last Berth"", fed the Komodo Dragons and quoted some of Tennyson's Ulysses.Bond is experiencing a renaissance and you will be shaken, stirred and thoroughly entertained.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
agile blockbuster with depth and style,"What do we expect from a Bond film? Above all, we expect the self-satisfied aura of invincibility the titular character exudes and a parade of dazzling consumable goods (women included). Generally speaking Bond films are bad even when they are good; stale.Since Daniel Craig took the role the general idea seemed to be dragging the franchise and its hero into a brave new world, with Skyfall they succeed third time lucky (Casino Royale was in many ways excellent but dragging too much baggage from the past it narratively veered from episodic melodrama to gratuitous sadism not knowing quite what it was doing in the end)What makes Skyfall different? The boldness of the narrative vision, the dramatic presence of Craig, the balance between humor and pathos, the brilliant cinematography, the weight of the cast... In all areas Skyfall is a departure from our expectations while still remaining the story of James Bond: a daring British spy pitted against a master criminal with action, romance, drama and humor; all the expected ingredients are present, except the staleness which is replaced with true excitement, a welcome sense of danger, and suspense.The director Sam Mendes deserves special mention for his versatility which helps the whole film gel and gives us a classic film which is bound to finish as one of the biggest blockbusters of the year.The Avengers gave a similar buzz of fresh popular cinema earlier this year and exceeded expectations, even for a much-hyped super-production, I think this will be a definite turning point for the Bond franchise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Bond is back, for better or worse","An ex-agent bent on revenge against M wreaks havoc on MI6, and only Bond can stop him.It is difficult to talk about Skyfall in its own terms as it makes such overt intertextual reference to the preceding two films, and the franchise as a whole. Under siege from the slickness of the Bourne movies, the parody of Austin Powers, and the backstory angst of Batman, the 007 franchise decided to re-invent itself with Daniel Craig and Casino Royale. It all got muddled in Quantum, and Skyfall puts Mendes at the helm to set the ship straight. Casino Royale seemed to be at pains to mitigate, if not exactly justify, the misogynistic legacy of Connery, Moore and Brosnan. Bond had been done over in his early double-O career and love was his weak spot. Skyfall turns it all around once more, taking aim at a female M, and using Moneypenny to show women do not belong in the field, but behind desks as secretaries to M and 007. The Aston Martin returns to symbolise this reversion to the old patriarchal order. A woman is shot but Bond mourns the whisky spilled as collateral damage. A shaken not stirred dry martini might not have been worth a damn to the Casino Royale Bond, but his shaken drink is ""just perfect"" this time. Bond is getting on, his bones creak, and the Qs are getting younger and lippier. But the more the world changes, Skyfall seems to say, the more Bond will stay the same. We are even back to the villains wanting to talk him to death, rather than just shoot the bloody menace.Not so much a new outing then, or even a re-boot, but a re-set of the franchise to traditional values - for better or worse.Great use of locations, especially Istanbul and Scotland (Bond, the quintessential Englishman, apparently grew up in Scotland - no wonder he has issues. Though it does explain Connery's accent). The action sequences are top class, and Bardem cuts loose to great effect as the evil genius. The attempts at modernity falter, however: M is called to a parliamentary committee to account for three executed undercover agents, and lamely quotes Tennyson. Bond's backstory (turns out Batman and Bond both have loss anxiety) is touched upon only to be dismissed by a one-liner quip as Bond watches his childhood home go up in flames. The script strains to keep it all coherent and plausible, and suspension of disbelief is required in greater degrees at some points. Personally, I couldn't always mange it and so my enjoyment of Skyfall was patchy.So Bond is back, and will be back again, baggage unloaded, and any nods to PC mores or gender politics have been jettisoned like an unwanted passenger in the Aston Martin. The traditionalists will be happy with this re-invention and threading through of New Lad culture tropes. For my part, I had grown fond of the vulnerable Casino Royale Bond. Skyfall works partly as an apology for that incarnation. A shame really. I'll miss him.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Question of Sport,"We can all pretend that Quantum of Solace never happened. But how does Skyfall compare with Casino Royale? Daniel Craig's Bond debut was an exquisitely made, neat and nasty exercise in sexual and violent tension which brought Bond bang up to date. But reboots are always at an advantage - the filmmakers have a pre-stocked toy box of tropes and expectations to play with. Skyfall, on the other hand, comes four years after a dud, with a director more suited to symbolism than stunts. Barbara Broccoli and MGM need Skyfall to be a success, lest the series is dragged back into the obscurity of the Dalton era or the preposterousness of latter Brosnan.After the stylised pyrotechnics of Road to Perdition, the war-inside war film Jarhead, and the masterful but talky Revolutionary Road, one might expect that director Sam Mendes would put the brakes on Bond. But the 143 minutes fly by. If anything, I found myself longing for more. More time constructing the icy relationships between Bond, M (Judi Dench) and Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), and more time sparring with Bond and Silva (Javier Bardem).Bardem's magnificent monster (part Hannibal Lecter, part Anton Chigurh, part Joker, making an entrance like Frank-N-Furter) appears at first to be an offensive, old-fashioned equation: campness = homosexuality = evil. But then great writing makes sense of the love triangle. Silva adores M (for Mother), but feels betrayed by her. Silva is expressing the repressed abandonment issues felt by Bond. And the relationship between M and Bond is precisely the mother-son bond (!) coveted by Silva.Even more interestingly, Silva seems to embody Bond's deepest fears. With a threatening caress, Silva directly challenges our hero's ferocious heterosexuality; and he's secretly deformed, while Bond possesses a paranoid obsession with physical perfection. Silva is the expression of the scared little boy hiding behind the ""cool"" facade; the child who could never grow up, still playing with the toys that Mummy allows him, and still sulking when he's told off.The dynamic between Bond and Silva takes the film in the thematic direction of The Dark Knight. And why not? This new Bond is as conflicted and repressive as Batman; damaged goods doing good in a modern world that promises safety and intimacy but provides neither. But while the final act of Nolan's flawed opus went wildly awry, Bond 23 ends entirely appropriately for a 50-year celebration, by returning to its beginnings. The raw, stripped-down finale recalls Straw Dogs' final storm. With its dwindling characters cast black against its fiery backdrop, it's as primal and mythic as Bond himself.The only missteps are when it feels like the filmmakers seem to feel the need to actively remind us that we are watching James Bond and not The Dark Knight, such the casino fight scene that ends with a cheesy reptilian death. Typically Bond, maybe, yet it comes straight after an atypical, empathic exchange between Bond and Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe) about her induction into child prostitution and the imprisoning nature of fear.Overall, it would be a hard task to name a more satisfying or sophisticated Bond film. Budding screenwriters should take a leaf out of the screenwriters' (Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan) book: the last line spoken by M in this movie is an absolute killer, bursting with meaning without spelling it out; a reminder that, in a world of pragmatists and assassins, love is expressed in actions, and the significance is in the subtext.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Not the best Bond ever, but easily the best Bond of Daniel Craig","I don't like reviewing a movie that was reviewed hundreds of times, though I do make an exception every now and again. Well here's one, and the main reason I do write it is because I saw too many claiming it's the best Bond ever - I could never pick a single one but It's one of the top ten which is quite an achievement considering the two previous ones which I rank at the bottom of the list. I hated the reboot, I think it was done for all the wrong reasons and in the worst possible way, and I think Quantum of Solace kept a bad thing going in the wrong direction. This one does go back to the older style, which in my book is the only reason for Bond to exist. If Bond tries to be another Jason Bourne, it takes an original and makes a copycat out of him, and it's plain shame. This one feels like Daniel Craig was eventually allowed to give his own version to Bond, and it's a good one. The whole cast is stellar, Javier Bardem is as superb as everyone has said, Albert Finney gets five minutes on screen and as the old pro that he is, uses them to steal the show, and all the would be new regulars of the series are doing a great job. Sam Mendes, does show a great flare that does suit the film well. All together it's a great fun film, but I personally can't compare it to any of the other great Bonds of the past simply because they are all so very different and dependent on the personality of the actor in the role (or lack of it - at least in one case).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the best Bond films in the last 40 years or so...,"You see a lot of people writing bad reviews of Skyfall. Pesonally, I believe that it is one of the top Bond films ever. It had everything a spy action thriller needs - the hero (Bond), a terrific villain (Silva), a damsel in distress (M). What also makes it one of the best films ever is an excellent soundtrack and moments of distress (bombing of MI6 and M's assassination attempt)...But the person who makes this movie really stand out from the rest is Javier Bardem. his performance was amazing and he really is the best Bond villain ever for me (probably shares 1st place with Le Chiffre from Casino Royale).A 5 star film for me...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
My Name is Bourne.....Jason Bourne,"What makes Bond's series so special? In my opinion, because they have the best villains who want to rules the world, conquer some countries, killing million of people just for their breakfast, girls who have rare qualities not just some bimbos, highly advanced technologies which may hit the market pretty soon, unlimited support from MI6 even some helps from CIA, Interpol, government, military etc around the world, even in the isolated area and any other 'over the top' things we could imagine. Yes, these aren't real, but we get that picture long ago. So by stripping those and replace Craig with Damon will make Skyfall another Bourne movie. And somehow the grand Bond's theme we normally get in the beginning and the end of the movie sounds well..too grand.Now, apart from that, this movie actually pretty decent as an action movie. The story, acting, action scenes, etc are quite gripping. The first 20 mins of this movie will immediately put you right in the middle of the story and you don't want to miss it till the end.There are some plot holes. I guess, when people make a movie as real as they can, the plot holes also became easier to see. For example, when the villains in police uniform are after M, Bond already warned her, but the security in that building is quite loose and those villains infiltrate the building with less resistance. In fact, the villains practically do their plan so smooth almost like getting candy from a baby. While Bond's team struggle to keep up. I'm also wonder why MI6 seems has no support from their own government, police, military etc, while the bad guy could easily get police car, military chopper etc.So, while the movie is quite good, I can only score it 7 for not being a true Bond movie. I hope the next one could be better, if it's just become a follower of Bourne's series, well the Bond's era will be gone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Amazing Film but Slow Too,"Skyfall is the 23rd Bond film. It was one of the most anticipated films of 2012. It was Amazing and did really good on the box office.

A Triumphant Return for 007,"As I see it, we were incredibly lucky to receive the twenty-third Bond movie, SKYFALL. There were a lot of problems with MGM, the studio that owned the franchise and brought us each of the twenty-two previous entries, and for a while it looked like the franchise might be dead in the water. As a major fan of the series, this was an incredibly depressing possibility for me. So the eventual announcement that Bond was on his way back to the big screen and he was being directed by an Oscar-caliber filmmaker was an exciting time. The final product was lauded by critics and audiences (with a final score of 92% on Rotten Tomatoes) and I couldn't agree more with all the praise. Personally, I loved it as a triumphant return after a five-year hiatus and a perfect blend of the modern 007 that Daniel Craig has come to embody with loving homages to the classic 007 we've loved. SKYFALL is one of the rare 007 movies where the mission is a more personal venture for our hero. The villain doesn't have grand schemes of world domination or financial gain. Instead, the mana former MI6 agenthas a more personal agenda and targets M (Dame Judi Dench) in a series of terrorist attacks meant to discredit her. But he has no intention of stopping there. Meanwhile, James Bond has been MIA since a mission went awry and is forced to return to service when MI6 is publicly targeted in an explosive attack.Just about every quibble I have with SKYFALL is minor. This movie is fantastic and there are no major issues that ruin the experience for me in any sense. I do agree that the movie does run a bit too long. Well, that's not necessarily true because I've sat through longer movies without a problem. I guess it's more that you can feel the run-time in SKYFALL at some moments, especially in the final act. The final act, a massive on-going action set-piece and a glimpse into the James Bond's past, drags on a little. It's explosive and exciting at the start, but the energy sort of peters out by the end and leaves the final confrontation with the villain a little anticlimactic. My only other complaint, and it's more out of selfishness than anything else, is I would have loved more time with the villain. Javier Bardem is the film's antagonist, an MI6 agent who goes by the pseudonym Raoul Silva who maintains a grudge after having been abandoned to suffer in the hands of an enemy nation. While just about all of the Bond villains in the past have obviously had some sort of screw loose, Silva comes across as full- blown psychotic. He's calm, calculating, and not averse to sacrificing lives to get his point across and accomplish his goals. Silva has jumped through the ranks to become one of my favorite all-time 007 villains, and I wish we'd gotten some more time with him. He doesn't arrive until around 45 minutes in the film, and I'm cool with that. Let the suspense build and give him a cool reveal late in the gameI'm down for that and Mendes pulled it off perfectly. But then he disappears again after some fantastic action sequences and we don't see him until the end. It feels like a wasted opportunity, but I suppose too much of a good thing would've ruined the effect.SKYFALL shows some love for the fans who made James Bond so long lasting and popular with plenty of loving references to classic 007. The Aston Martin (from GOLDFINGER) makes a return after a nearly twenty year absence; I believe the last time we saw Bond in an Aston Martin (though not necessarily THE Aston Martin) was the beginning of GOLDENEYE in 1995. We also get our first introduction to Q since the series was rebooted in 2006. Ben Wishaw is a little younger that we're accustomed to in our Quartermaster and it's too soon to tell if he'll successfully fill the shoes of the late Desmond Llewellyn, but he brings confidence and a more modern tech edge to the character. No bizarre gadgets here, just a Walther with palm print identification. The rest of the MI6 staff is filled out in SKYFALL but I won't go into details here to avoid some pretty major spoilers. Newcomers to the series include Naomie Harris as Eve, a relatively new field agent, and Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory, a bureaucrat who is brought in to investigate M when MI6's mission in the opening sequence falls apart.True fans of the 007 franchise should find plenty to love here. I was excited to find that the story was presented on a much smaller scale (personal revenge as opposed to some grander scheme) but giving us the exotic locales and beautiful women we expect from the series. SKYFALL is a nice blend of the more serious, action-oriented new Bond with a taste of the classic, and the ending left me excited for the inevitable next film in the series.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Daniel Craig Brings Bond Full Circle,"This is one of the finest Bond films made. The opening stunt sequence is brilliant. Daniel Craig was given the task of giving the origin story to Bond in Casino Royale. The origin story comes full circle in this tale by introducing classic Bond elements, characters, cars and musical cues from the old movies. The way the dazzling imagery from the exotic locations was shot transcends the genre. Far from the usual two-dimensional villain, Javier's Silva exhibits a sweetness that makes him even creepier. The film continues to probe Bond's past taking us further into the roots of the character than even Casino Royale did. So, in addition to the usual well-choreographed action sequences and unique settings, this film is lavishly shot with an emotional resonance that begs multiple viewings.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
please no Ralph Fiennes,"what's up with you people ? i LOVED this film! my only problem with it is introducing Ralph Fiennes, who to me radiates cruelty and at the very least always triggers mistrust - I always am suspicious he's the bad guy.

Not sure about the choice of Bond's receptionist either, they went off kilter - her role is quite different in the books and they should stick to some things to keep it Bond. Loved the cinematography - Some of the scenes were beautifully shot - the Scottish manse in the light of the helicopter, for one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
At last the real Bond is back!,"It is to my immense delight, that Skyfall has turned out to be a masterpiece and a true return to the Bond film fans have been yearning for.Skyfall is without question the best Bond movie since Goldeneye and is possibly the best of the entire series (yes it is that good!).I was never convinced by Daniel Craig as Bond until now, but he turns in a truly fantastic performance. All the elements of Bond are there, the 'glib remarks and pithy comebacks' as Alex Trevelyan would say, delivered without any cheesinessThe rest of the cast are all great, stand outs of course being Judi Dench and Javier Bardem. Ben Wishaw is also excellent as the new 'Q'. Anyone who had seen the BBC series 'The Hour' would already know the guy can really act.I think credit for Skyfall being so remarkably good, is down to helmer Sam Mendes and of course his DP. The film hits all the right notes and is genuinely riveting from start to finish. The pacing is great and it never feels like one action sequence pointlessly rolling into another, as it did with Casino Royale. Instead it is a complete and extremely satisfying experienceHaving suffered nothing but disappointment since 'The World is Not Enough' (the last semi-decent Bond until now). I'm almost ecstatic at this amazing return to form, and sincerely hope Mendes will direct the next oneTo sum up the past few bond films:Die another day: A total mess - could see what they were trying to do, with nods to virtually every other film in the series, but just doesn't work. And as for the invisible car, well suspension of disbelief is taken way past breaking point 4/10Casino Royale: Not a bad action film taken on face value, but not Bond! Tries way to hard to be Bourne, and Craig's Bond is very muffled and forcibly over-serious. Product placement is also ridiculous! 6/10Quantum of Solace: Absolute bunk - have tried to watch it a couple of times, but never been able to sit through the whole thing. Dreadful shaky-cam simply compounds the multitude of problems the film already has 3/10 (I think that's quite generous!)Skyfall: A dazzling return to form for the franchise - really can't fault it. It also shows that with the right director, Craig makes a really excellent Bond and in my opinion puts him up there with best. It has everything and more Bond fans could want, without ever veering into silliness and it's also funny; something that has been so sorely lacking in last two outings. The chemistry between the cast is also terrific. This the Real reboot of the franchise 10/10Anyone, who like myself, had completely lost faith in the franchise, needs to see this - it will restore it, and you'll be a happy Bond fan again! It should be nominated for a stash of academy awards, whether it will, or will simply be overlooked because it's Bond, time will tellFinally as an aside, I've always thought Craig was earmarked for Bond after his performance in Layer Cake; particularly the scene where he is throwing shapes with the gun in his flat. Ben Wishaw 'Q' appeared alongside him in that film, funny how things work out ;-)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Good, but was expecting more.","I have a confession to make. I have never seen a Bond film until now.Okay, forget it. I enjoyed this movie somewhat... but there was something missing. All the action scenes, from the opening chase sequence in Turkey, up till the final battle in the Scottish wilderness were pretty decent, nonetheless. As the modern Bond films have shown, Craig's Bond is a tougher, more realistic Bond, with his own depth and frailties that shine through even with the mock-tough lines he says throughout the movie.However, Skyfall was quite a letdown. Sure, the buildup was decent and everything, but when the villain shows up, it just falls apart. As for the plot, there wasn't much of a plot there. The film could've been character driven, but it just wasn't enough to make me feel for any of them, they had a lot of potential. Silva, Bond and M weren't as deep as the synopsis of the film here described. I was actually expecting Bond to show more of his own morality and insecurities instead of sticking to protecting M for the rest of the movie, even going as far as to betray MI6 could be good, M's past and whatever wrong or bad choices she made to have Silva on her tail, and send Bond into doubting her, and Silva to be more complex, his motivations for killing M explained further. A few plot twists could've been good too.About halfway into the movie, I was actually wondering, ""What the hell are the supporting characters there for anyway?"" Moneypenny and Mallory were just a waste of space... they were just there to fill in the rest of the scenery. They could've been further developed, especially Mallory.However, the film's production values were all great, never an issue. The wide, sweeping landscape of the Scottish hills to the fight in a office building in Shanghai with glowing neon signs in the background... well, they were all beautifully shot. The editing was decent, the action scenes are great... however, what made me speechless were the opening credits. They were beautifully done, all evoking the apocalypse inside Bond's world... with such emotion and the haunting song sung by Adele just makes me all hyped up for the film... but it just wasn't that impressive.All in all, Skyfall is a pretty entertaining watch. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
My Review,"I have just recently been to see this the 23rd outing in the series of Bond films,and i must say it was a real treat for any true bond fan.The plot was so much different to the past few from Goldeneye onwards,the film harks back to the good old days of Connery,and of course that added treat of seeing the Original Aston Martin DB5 in action just clinched the deal,Daniel Craig super as ever as 007,with an air of Timothy Dalton's role as bond slightly shining through,Dame Judi Dench again superb as M,Javier Bardem excellent as the bad guy Silva,and i have to say great performance by Ralph Fiennes as pompous MI6 boss Gareth Mallory,and was great to see one of this country's finest actors in cameo-role,Albert Finney as Kincade,also have to remark on actor Ben Wishaw as a very young Q.The film is a much darker bond film,showing the vulnerable but also caring side of bond,harking back to Licence To Kill,Overall one of the best,with a lot of twists and turns,and a remarkable ending,Adelle's song is a true winner,one that reminds me of a John Barry hit,so what will be the 24th in the chain,as i sat in the darkened cinema,end credits rolling,i pondered the idea,the idea of seeing a good old fashioned bond ending,remember those far off bond days,when the baddies hidden lair was stormed at the end by hundreds of guys in boiler suits,007 leading the fight,maybe even actor David Hedison reprising his role as the famous Felix Lieter,but as far as bond films go,Skyfall is a winner.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Skyfall falls somewhat flat for me,"James Bond films are always great action movies, regardless of what actor is playing Bond, the movies are always fun and entertaining for the viewers. In this respect, Skyfall delivers, it's as good as any and all of the Bond movies, so if that is what brings you to the theater then you will not be disappointed. In the latest effort, there is plenty of action, special effects, situations only James Bonds could escape from, and tons of edge of your seat chase scenes. In the end to me, it just seems it goes on too long, I found that the drama and anticipation of doom and dread became weary, and in truth I was waiting for it all to end. The acting was excellent, the storyline was decent, the action suburb, and the special effects were truly outstanding. Those elements earn this a 7 out of 10, but sometimes a little less may actually be better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Mediocre Film,"I am a big James Bond fan, but ""Skyfall"" is only a mediocre film to me. I rank it as tied for the worst Bond film with ""Die another Day"". I gave both these films a 5/10, which is perhaps generous and influenced by my love for the series.""Skyfall"" is just not very good on many levels, if you go in with high expectations as I did due to the glowing press, you will probably be disappointed. The film is too long, too dark, too dull, with the actions scenes not great either. The best part was near the beginning when Bond is in Shanghai, China; this part features great cinematography and visual imagery, but the rest of the film goes downhill quickly. Bond uses the woman he meets here in a psychopathic way, continuing on a bad trend.Further problems include making ""M"" into Bond's surrogate mother; he calls her 'mum' often. Bond and the villain seem to be two kids, one wicked, one slightly better, fighting for their mother's attention and fate. Then there is a theme of Bond being reborn in Scotland thru the action, but this whole thing just doesn't work for me in a Bond film, or any film for that matter.So, in summary, ""Skyfall"" is worth a watch, but nothing to write home about.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Sometimes the Old Way is the Best,"After years of uncertainty, studio bankruptcy and a less than impressive box office display from its predecessor, Skyfall has arrived on screens.As a classic Bond fan it might not be surprising that I share the common low opinion of Daniel Craig's outings in the role. The 'gritty-realistic' fad of Hollywood threatened to squeeze out every drop of charm, cheese, suave and, let's face it, fun that makes James Bond such a loved franchise.Skyfall is much more of a love letter to classic Bond. From the very first shot, the first note in the score the nostalgia comes rushing back, and with a grin on your face you know you're about to embark on a thrill ride reminiscent of the Connery days.Daniel Craig finally seems the part of James Bond, gone is the brooding, replaced by magnetism and a glint in his eye, a perfect sweet spot between commanding and charming.Javier Bardem plays what will doubtlessly go down as one of the all time best villains in Bond history in Silva. He's subtle, sinister and all together creepy. It is his vendetta running the plot. The film has a very intimate feel, not a contrived end of the world threat but a tense personal affair.The film is full of a host of top British acting talent, Naomie Harris (28 Days Later), Ben Whishaw (Layer Cake) and Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort) all giving strong performances. Special Mention must go to Dame Judi Dench, having portrayed M in 6 films previously, this is her crowning moment. Skyfall belongs to her just as much as Craig or Bardem.All in all this is a beautifully shot, expertly directed film and must be considered as one of the best Bonds of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
He's BACK,"After the disappointment and bafflement that was The Quantum of Solace, and the almost Chick Flick that was Casino Royale I was ready to write Daniel Craig off as another George Lazenby. BUT.....what a difference, thank god for talented directors and writers who actually have a clue what Bond is all about. Connery, Moore....move over the new boy has come of age the name is Craig, Daniel Craig. This bond is back to the formula we all loved before Dalton and Brosnan, ridiculous chase scenes, pithy one liners and above all putting the Great BACK into Great Britain. Gone is the 'Ra Ra America' back is 'Rule Britannia', MI6's oh so helpful colleagues across the pond who of late seem to have saved James's bacon more than once do not even merit more than one line. Q branch makes a welcome return with Q's relationship with Bond back to the normal sparing matches of double entente although sadly no submarine cars or exploding pens. The Bond Girls really don't feature much, so in that respect this isn't the Bond of old (no Mr Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang)But most of all the story line is simply stunning, we have glimpses of all aspects of Bond, the inner turmoil, his past, his future, what drives him. The story line also appears to be a subtle 2 fingers to the British government, defence cuts, civilian oversight of something civilians can never understand and the treatment of service personnel. I think it only fair to mention the much beloved DB5 makes a return worthy of Bond, I actually heard intakes of breath and cheering when she finally appears on our screen (and no it wasn't just the blokes). There are welcome moments of light relief through what is a very gritty and brilliantly suspense filled film, Bond's 'present' from Q and from Mr Silver both generated a laugh or two. The final sequences are beautifully poignant and play to the strengths of the surrounding scenery with amazing ability, plus an entrance any man of a certain age will love.A fantastic film for Bond lovers and everyone else, be prepared for the ride of your life, discover Bond like never before, take a tissue (and not just to wipe the saliva from your mouth after the cars, girls, guns, chases, fights, helicopters, explosions. Or the tears of laughter from your eyes from the British wit, the one liners, and the down right insanity.), enjoy the best Bond film in 50 years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Excellent movie from start to finish,"Absolutely Loved the movie. Everything about it was awesome from the opening chase to the shoot out at the end. It would be great to see some Oscar nods, especially for the cinematography and the song during the opening credits. Hoping they can get Mendes/Deakins back for another one because you can tell right from the start that this a much higher caliber Bond film than we have gotten for decades. What a way to bring Bond back after a 4 year absence. I am such a happy movie goer. I cant remember the last time i enjoyed a movie this much. If there is anyone that has any doubts about this movie, let me put them to rest. Already looking forward to the next one. Happy 50th anniversary Mr. Bond!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Few words review...,"The film is what you expect from a 007 movie... Nothing more nothing less and it just gets boring. Action, drama, a bit of humor and that's about it. 6/10, its exactly just above average. The acting is good enough but Bond, has lost his quality, his class, his savior of the world attitude and thats a really BAD thing... And where are the cool gadgets of his??? The crazy cars? They just throw them out the window in this one. So.. Things are missing and things are changed but in the other hand for me 007 was a dying franchise anyway. My verdict is, quite watchable movie for what it is some action before you go to sleep...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond is Resurrected!,"Hearing so many rumors before the movie came out, I thought they were going to trail away from the true bond that we all love. I couldn't have been any wronger. Not only did they bring the true bond back, but they continued a franchise and reverted back to the old style bond. They kept to the James Bond references that make Bond, Bond.I never thought Daniel Craig could pull off such a good bond. I thought Casino Royal was good but more of a entrance for Daniel Craig's James Bond. Great Job Daniel Craig and the rest of the Crew. Stick to the old bond and you will continue to succeed. Go see this and you wont be disappointing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond's Full Circle,"It took 50 years, but Daniel Craig brought Bond back to Earth and full circle to the original ideas of both the first movies and the books in his latest venture, Skyfall. Silva is a former agent of MI6 and has declared war on the organization and M, played by Judy Dench. Once a 00 himself, he wants a vendetta for her abandoning him. Bond, too, feels somewhat betray as he was hung out to dry by M when trying to recapture a hard drive containing the name of MI6 agents undercover in terrorist cells. The two are tied together. Bond disappears for a short time, only to return when he learns of the first terrorist attack on MI6 and the threat of the security breach. He's not ready, he doesn't trust M, and he's stuffing anger. Eventually, he is reactivated as M and her branch come under heavy scrutiny. She makes her plea because of how the world has lost clear, definite enemies and how they have scurried away into the shade. Silva attempts an assassination of her. Bond then takes it upon himself to protect M in his childhood home, Skyfall. Ever since Bond was re-invented in 2006 with Casino Royale, many people have lamented that Bond changed from their childhood memories of cheesy plots, megalomaniacs, cool gadgets, hot women, and a comic book persona evident ever since You Only Live Twice. Others simply think Bond is a rip-off of the modern Bourne series. Frankly, Bourne goes back to Bond. In the books, and in the first three to four movies, Bond was a ruthless assassin. He was a blunt instrument bent on stopping lethal terrorist forces and the KGB. This is probably the best part of Skyfall: it comes full circle back to the beginning. We meet Q, a young computer expert and arms expert. He's not inventing exploding pens, watches with buzz saws or super magnets, but radios and improving firearms. That is also what Q did in the books. We also meet a Moneypenny - in a round-a-bout way. There are also tips of the hats to other elements of Bond: the classic theme, the Bond entrance into the moving eye, and the best was a cameo appearance of the old Astin Martin in Goldfinger. There is also some depth. For a change there is exploration on the psyche of being a spy - also a theme in the books. And there was also an exploration of where Bond came from - but not too much so we are still left guessing. Finally, the villain, Silva, is not a megalomaniac, but a genius, vindictive egomaniac. His mind is warped by his disfigurement. True, as the villain he wasn't exceptional, but definitely competent. So for those who love the comic book Bond made famous by Moore and Brosnan, then buy those movies and enjoy them to your heart's content. Yes, I enjoyed many of them, but they are pale in comparison to the real James Bond of the books and early movies ... and Skyfall.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond...50 years...and way to go,"Saw Skyfall yesterday and i must say its the best mainstream movie of 2012 so far. I see lot of guys saying its boring and other stuffs. I wonder if they even saw the movie or doing something else in the theater. After a long time actually I saw the whole movie felt really 2.30 hrs already? From the start, the movie is gripping. It has a great story. Bond is old, his vulnerability, his emotional relation with M, Creepy and chilling berdem...this movie is way more than normal bond gadgets, girls and action. In fact the movie ends with no gadgets and cars....back to old days..country, hunting guns and old explosives. yeah there are weak links like over used agent stolen list, hacking etc. but those are just small side branches and doesn't take away the real essence of the movie.Craig was as usual human and super good. Judy dench was mind blowing..but the Berdem is the one who steals the show.When the critics are divided, you can have some doubts...but for Skyfall , all the critics were saying the same thing, and they were right. It's a best bond movie for a while.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"A Refined, Refreshing Film","When I sat down a few hours ago to watch the latest Bond adaptation, I really had no idea what to expect. Casino Royale was a great film that redefined the franchise, while Quantum of Solace seemed to take a huge step backward. To be honest, while I was hoping for the best, I really was expecting the worst, especially since the previews really made it look like a carbon copy of the last one.Not surprisingly, Skyfall opens very much like the previous two; we are thrust directly into the action. If you've ever watched a Bond movie, you've seen the first twenty minutes of Skyfall. Chase scene, explosions, shattered glass, yeah, you get it.Here's the good news; the first twenty minutes are easily the film's worst moments. After that, we are quickly ushered into something much more refreshing. The story, while predictable at times, is quite engaging, and the film looks absolutely beautiful. There are some scenes of the Shanghai skyline that are incredible, and the prolonged sequences that follow make for a visually pleasing experience.As for the acting, Daniel Craig is really strong here. In fact, there isn't a single piece out of place. Ralph Fiennes and Javier Bardem are both fantastic, and I also quite enjoyed the new Quartermaster.All in all, this is a great film. Seriously, it's quite different from the other Bond movies and I can virtually guarantee you won't be disappointed.RATING: 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Almost iconic Bond,"Stripped of almost all gadgets, Bond is back fighting for Queen and country, ready to face a very uncertain and different world.After Bond's complete re-invention in the superb ""Casino Royale"", followed by a meandering and disappointing ""Quantum of Solace"", we are back on solid ground. Arguably completing the three picture transition to the fully rounded Bond character, that audiences have embraced for 50 years.Opening with an excellent played for real stunt filled prologue, Bond (Daniel Craig) then promptly disappears. Returning only when a real threat to ""M"" becomes evident and agents lives are at risk, following the loss of a stolen data disk. That threat arriving in the slightly effeminate, disturbing and clearly ""a few rounds short of a full clip"" Bond villain, Silva (Javier Bardem).It is unusual for the Bond villain to arrive so late in the piece and to have such a narrow goal. It is obvious that the image of huge villainous lairs, with boiler-suited armies and world domination was destroyed forever by Austin Powers.Late perhaps but what an entrance, Bardem demanding we listen to him and watch every movement he makes, playing every scene he gets to the maximum. A classic interrogation scene that no doubt will be discussed on the Internet for some time to come.This is Bond at his most workmanlike, with a job to be done, ill-prepared on occasion and with more introspection than ever before. There are many quiet thoughtful scenes and Bardem makes for an excellent villain, you are never sure what he might do next.Judi Dench as ""M"" has her work cut out with a huge part in the film and carries it well, no doubt not expecting to be involved in gun fights at age 78. We also are introduced to Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) and the new ""Q"" (Ben Whishaw) both fitting well into the story. Agent Eve (Naomi Harris) defies usual Bond conventions by being adept in the field, beautiful of course and sharing perhaps the most intimate Bond scene yet, without hitting the sheets.The film swiftly moving from Istanbul to Shanghai to Macau but overall feels firmly based in Britain and latterly Scotland. There is a well choreographed fight scene back-lit with neon lighting, a grand entrance into a lantern lit casino, enough action and yet the film feels very grounded in the realities of the modern world. Self aware but still able to provide that hyper reality that Bond has always represented.Of course the film depends on the actor personifying our version of Bond and Craig fits the role like a glove. Difficult to believe now there was consternation when he was first cast. He manages to believably play a character that could either seduce, amuse or kill you, all without a moments pause.We get more background to Bond, as ""M"" admits that orphans make the best recruits. The latter scenes suggesting there is a desire to move the franchise forward again, seeking closure on the past and re-inventing for the future, although classic car lovers should look away.Like anything else, movies are about timing. This captures the zeitgest perfectly, a very British film riding on an uplift of nationalistic pride following the 2012 Olympics. Director Sam Mendes has created a serious film, although Bond has never looked better from a cinematography point of view and the franchise never in more robust health.There is no question that the combination of well executed real action sequences, tied with that iconic soundtrack is as good as cinema gets, a good Bond film is to be treasured and this is up there with the best.The film strangely opened much later in New Zealand, therefore box Office figures already indicate this has been the most successful Bond film ever, $700 million and counting. Clearly Bond will be back and soon.SummaryAs good as ""Casino Royale"" but in a different way. Not as iconic perhaps but lays solid foundations for the next two pictures Craig has signed to make, due in 2014 and 2016.If you love cinema you cannot walk past a good Bond film, this is one and therefore comes highly recommendedhttp://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
good but not good enough,"alright ,there has been huge talk about skyfall . some say its the best bond movie ,some its ""the worst"".my thought would be to not compare it with other classics. Now , m not gonna describe the story line. Lets talk about why to watch this movie: 1. firstly , there is no other actors who could have done a better job as Bond than Daniel Craig .He did a brilliant job in projecting Bond the right way . 2.the villain has done fairly good job as well. 3. the movie is full of style ,action , panache and awesome dialogues . 4. the action scenes have been shot brilliantly. 5. the creative starting numbering clip , on which they spend 3 months, is excellent. 6. overall there is no crap and nonsense in the story or screenplay either which you generally tend to see in typical suspense movie . then , coming to the point why you shouldn't watch the movie: 1. the story lacks suspense elements that are integral part of any secret agent movie especially when its a JAMES BOND flick.so the overall story was quite disappointing . 2. neither of the feeling ,thrill or emotion, were clear and dominating the movie. 3. i personally liked casino royale very much .i was expecting the movie to touch that bar again if not cross it and compared to royale ,the movie was very disappointing.In short , don't watch this movie if you are a die heart James bond fan. although its a good movie , entertaining and no boring or redundancy is there ,so you can enjoy it anyway.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Best Bond ever, Worst Bond ever, everyone's an expert!","Best Bond ever worst Bond ever dull and boring exciting poor direction great direction, everyone seems to be an expert on how to make a James Bond film! First time I watched Skyfall I loved it but there was a sense of disappointment at the end but I didn't know why? Second time was better I picked up on bits I had missed first time but still that sense of, have just been to see it for a third time not something I would normally do no matter how much I enjoy a film but Skyfall really is that repeatable, this time I realised why I had a sense of disappointment the truth is this film is that good I just didn't want it to end it was as though there was more to come even though it had a definitive ending. Third viewing again I picked up on things I had missed previous, watch and listen carefully everything really is tied up nicely. The appearance of the DB5 makes no sense whatsoever when you think about it but it is actually one of the great moments of any Bond film and a brilliant turning point in this film each viewing the audience got very excited at this scene which set us up for what is a cracking showdown in the Scottish Highlands. Skyfall is a credit to the people who do know how to make a Bond film, definitely something a bit different from what's gone before but surly this can only be a good thing?

Average Bond Film...Nothing Spectacular,"This film met my expectations, which are never high for 007 films. I expected some action, chase scenes, attractive women and plot twists. I also expected shallow characters and substandard story lines. What I didn't expect was such a slowly developing plot. After the opening chase scene, which is very exciting, the film flat lines for about 30 minutes. Then, we're not introduced to the antagonist until nearly an hour in to the film and his motivations are revealed even later than that. That makes for a difficult film to be drawn into. But script writing has never been the strength of the James Bond franchise. It's best to just sit back and enjoy watching things blow up. Fortunately, the climax of this film has a lot of that to offer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Very good movie,"First of all, I have to say that Daniel Craig now owns this part. He is the best Bond ever in my view.This movie was very, very good, and deserves the accolades it gets. Even so, and this might be unfair, it didn't quite do the trick for me, and I prefer Casino Royale to this one. CR had the kind of gritty quality that this one lacked. For me, there was too much a return to the wise-cracking character a la the 80's and 90's. I preferred the deadpan seriousness of CR, which I would give 10/10.As I said, it might be unfair to judge a Bond film this way, but even so, Casino Royale for me at least, transcended the Bond mold, and made it into an classic, even outside the Bond universe, whereas there was somehow too many one-liners from Bond and silliness in the villain (sorry Javier Bardem) for me to take it as seriously as CR.It subtracted a little every time Bond delivered a zinger, as I really liked his more dangerous and dark persona in Casino Royale. But still, a very good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Better than the classics? Naaa, c'mon guys.","The average age of IMDB customers seems to be very, very young. 7.8 points out of 10 is unfortunately too high. Especially when you consider how far classics like Goldfinger or From Russia With Love are beaten here. Kids, you have to examine the old treasures, you will be amazed. Daniel Craig wasn't a bad Bond, but he never reaches the class of Connery, he never reaches the easy-going slapstick manner of Roger Moore. It may be that it fits the time, it may be that the films have higher ratings due to their high costs and higher viewership.

"Brilliant New Bond Story, They Nailed It!","SkyfallWithout doubt one of the best Bond movies ever made, it just breathed in all the right places, Sam Mendes just got the best out of the actors and Daniel Craig just nailed it. The key thing that stands out is the script, it made sure all the key elements of the Bond franchise were present, and they were in spades, and yet this was a new story.The careful crafting of political expediency and personal revenge was masterfully conflated.When you look at this movie and its content and then look at No Time To Die, you can see clearly how it can all go wrong straying from the key elements that are Bond. We all know to be Bond is anachronistic to a modern ""woke"" agenda, a dinosaur from the 1950's, however, if you make a Bond movie, and want a Bond movie and want to keep a Bond audience you must not go far from Flemings intentions.For me this movie was a 10 outta 10 and these script writers should be used again as they got it right!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
When the Skyfallls.... this film DOESN'T crumble...,"'SKYFALL' was directed by Sam Mendes and stars Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem and Judi Dench. ​When a cyber terrorist steals a list of active MI6 agent names and bombs the MI6 offices, it's up to James Bond(Daniel Craig) to thwart this terrorists plan and stop him from releasing any more names to the public.This movie is god damn awesome. This was Mendes' first crack at a Bond movie and is BY FAR one of the best Bond movies ever made. Forget that 'Quantum of Solace' trash; this is Bond in his alcoholic prime and by God is it amazing. Daniel Craig is still one of the best Bond's and really sells the depressing, broken aspect of his character. Skyfall is probably the best shot Bond movie and looks visually stunning in every single sense of the word. This is a very character driven story and I love how well it was written. That said, in typical Bond fashion(for me at least), all the scenes and set pieces don't feel connected despite the fact that they are. In spite of this minor hurdle, this movie is a blast from start to finish and contains all the great action to feed action junkies, but also supplies a heartfelt story for people who actually care about plot. I know it's 2017 and no one cares about PLOT(what a childish thing) but for those of us with more than one brain cell, the story is great and possibly the Best Bond plot but I can't say for sure.Javier Bardem is like that creepy priest you saw when you went to church that one time. He'll sometimes crack a joke(which you'll laugh at just to comfort him) but at the end of the day, he's just gonna try and get you alone in a church after dark. Regardless, Bardem provides a chilling performance and actually makes Bardem's motivations make sense. Silva was also a great Bond villain and proved to be a great foil for Bond and worked well in today's current computer/hacked based climate. Judi Dench provides a heartfelt performance as the wonderful M and makes M the heart and soul of the movie. Ben Winshaw was a great choice for Q and aligning Q with the current computer based climate was also a genius idea. That said, both Ralph Fiennes and Naomie Harris' roles in this movie were kind of pointless. Not to say that their performances were lacklustre but their actual character and purpose made no sense.This is the most visually stunning Bond. Every shot is masterfully composed and lit. Every scene is masterfully edited and directed. Every frame of this movie provides atmosphere and makes this movie a true joy to behold.This movie's action was outstanding and it brings back all the classic Bond-isms. Despite that, the Bond Girl was completely useless and the Bond car was virtually non-existent(aside from a mini segment). I'm not saying this takes away from the movie but if you're gonna include them, at least go all in and try to make them interesting.Skyfall is probably the best Bond song. Say what you want about Adele or even this movie but you cannot die that song is incredible and the lyrics actually have meaning instead of just filler.Skyfall is one of the best Bond films. It's beautifully shot, well acted, masterfully directed and deserves a spot on the Bond hall of fame. Javier Bardem is one of the best Bond Villains and Skyfall is one of the best Bond songs. All in all, this movie is well worth a watch for old and new fans alike and I'll rate this movie 9 out of 10 Creepy Priests.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Terrific Performances and Action,"Skyfall (2012)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Daniel Craig's third time as James Bond has his loyalty to M (Judi Dench) questioned after a former agent (Javier Bardem) tries to take her out. Bond travels the globe trying to track down the bad guy but he soon realizes that there's only one old fashioned way to bring it all to a close. SKYFALL comes from director Sam Mendes and it's certainly a major step up from the previous film but it also takes the franchise into a new, more modern direction while being respectful to the old style as well. This film is clearly one of the best looking in the series and especially the stuff taking place in China. The beautiful way everything lights up the screen certainly looks terrific and the director also makes it very stylish and brings it to life. The screenplay here is another very good one and I really liked the way where all the characters are basically questioning stuff they've done in the past and what effect that is having on them in the present times. This is clearly a somewhat darker Bond and it works very well. The performances are among some of the best you're going to see from any Bond film with Craig easily putting his foot on the part and doing wonders with it. It's clear that he's doing something really incredible with the part and I think at this point it's fair to call him the second best. Dench is also very good in her part as she's given a lot more to do here than in previous films. Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Albert Finney, Ben Whishaw and Berenice Marlohe are all excellent in their support parts as well. Barden is also very memorable in his role as the villain but one wishes he had more screen time. The film contains one great action sequence after another with the beginning and ending to the picture really packing a bunch. I'm not going to go as far as some and call this the best Bond movie ever made but it's certainly one of the most entertaining and effective.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Note-Perfect Triumph,"Still note-perfect in every respect, not just the best Bond movie but a masterpiece of modern action cinema. Manages to be bold and to celebrate Bond-conventions; to deal with big ideas and focus on intimate emotions; to question Britain's place in the world and to not be parochial;. Bardem's Lecter-like villain is masterful, Craig is never better than he is here, and there's nothing more to be said about Judi Dench that hasn't been said multiple times elsewhere. A total triumph.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
one of the few Bonds I liked for its story more than the action,"I only skimmed through some of the reviews for this films, but I was shocked to see so many bad reviews. This is probably one of the few Bonds films - since Goldfinger - where I was interested enough in the story that I didn't get impatient waiting for the actions scenes. Admittedly, I used to only like Bond films for the action, and if you compare this to some of the more recent ones, it's not that action-heavy. It does have good action, but it also has a great story - not an overly confusing one, like some Bonds do. Unlike with some Bonds, the formulaic elements (the action scenes, confronting-the-villain scene, etc.)flowed smoothly, without feeling tacked on. Skyfall is great in ways that a lot of Bond films aren't.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A refreshing Bond movie,"I think this James Bond movie is one of the better movies in the series. It looks like ""Quantum of Solace"" and ""Casino Royale"", but far less like the older films. This is probably because of Daniel Craig, the new James Bond actor. First of all I'd like to say that the whole movie is exciting, and the director also dares to take some risks according to the events. He actually lets people die of whom you'd never expect it. And a few small plot twists keep things diverse. Daniel Craig is different from the other James Bond actors. For example; I think he's less of a womanizer, but then again more of an action hero, whereas Sean Connery was better with the ladies. Daniel Craig has already let one of his lovers die in a past movie. Something else that makes this movie unique, is that 007 and MI6 are actually being threatened and in danger. Though in most of the other movies Bond only went to his targets, the enemy is now doing the same to him. On the other hand, I also think the film lacks some of the classic James Bond aspects. A lot of classic elements have been revised and recreated, which might make the film fresher and more open to new viewers, but might also disappoint a lot of die-hard fans. The Aston Martin for example, has been totally renewed. A good thing it's in the movie, right? Well, you could say that, but what does having an Aston Martin matter if it doesn't have the famous Aston Martin looks? This is something most people probably don't really mind. But what about the people that love the series for the Aston Martin? They could be disappointed. And then of course, the gadgets; the film contains a lot of new gadgets, but they all play a less important role than they used to (and there's less of them). You can say about that whatever you want, but it sure does make the whole complex more realistic. And last of all, Q is finally back! And no, not as John Cleese or as Desmond Llewelyn. But this time in a whole new jacket. He's finally been replaced by a new, young actor: Ben Whishaw. An actor not very famous, probably even unknown to most of you. However: Skyfall is a great edition in the series. With even better special effects than its predecessors, well performed acting by both the old, and the new actors. And not to forget: some badass ass-kicking.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Tying in the past,"After half a century of secret servicing, James Bond (the awkward, but unequivocally manly Daniel Craig) and MI6 comes against their greatest threat: one of their own with a personal vendetta against M (Judi Dench), the mother hen of the British undercover network. During a Turkish mission a disk with all data regarding Arab world based secret agents gets stolen by a specialist hired hand. During the ensuing chase M makes a gut call, which ends with Bond being shot and presumed dead. With the data lost and the best agent gone, M now has to confront public tirades questioning her competence and suggesting her resignation from office. The full extent of the threat caused by the data loss only becomes apparent, when a cyberterrorist hacks into the MI6 HQ causing a gas explosion, killing many and having M watch the debris. This occurrence however brings back James Bond, an undying patriot, who holed up in a seaside resort, syphoning whiskey, while daring scorpions, was enjoying his post mortem retirement. Meanwhile former agent Silva (Javier Bardem) construes his bloody vengeance with little regard to lives lost...Honouring the 50 years of James Bond cinema frenzy comes an honest attempt at arguably the most cranially enjoying outing, which also does its utmost to homage the past Bond movies through witty commentary about the passing of time, introducing a modern era Q (Ben Whishaw) ridiculing shooting pens or simply knocking us back to memory lane by borrowing shots, scenes and gimmicks from past outings of the series. Within this happen questions about time, its relevance and a world best suited for the young, but not abandoned by the old, who search their own place in the new reality. Not entirely subtle in its approach, this ""No Country for Old Men"" counterargument falls rather flat, even at times bordering on hammy. Much further the enjoyment caused by the riveting attempt to close an era, complete a circle, which brings the first Bond instalments back into the frame and thus hitting home how great a legacy this series has left.Led by a stellar cast with Dench and Bardem especially excelling, the latter delivering another memorable bad guy persona, but one so strikingly different than Anton Chigurh, one enticingly menacing, but simultaneously infantile.Comparisons have been rife with the Nolan Batman series. And whereas ""Skyfall"" is vastly superior to the misguided gibberish of ""The Dark Knight Rises"", it fails to reach the level ""The Dark Knight"", but at the same time has a worrying tendency to follow too closely the latter's plot line. Just as the Joker allows himself to be captured to forward his grand plan, similarly such is the situation with Silva. The characters of Silva and Joker differ markedly, but unfortunately they overall actions, accompanying goons and certain plot solutions waste away ingenuity implanted elsewhere the Skyfall movie, making it overly repetitive. The plot itself makes little sense, becoming more crude glue interconnecting story lines, dramatic interaction (much more pronounced than in any other Bond movie), chase sequences and big blasts. As the underlying motive behind Silva becomes unhinged with the wanton destruction caused by his actions, the sensibility of his character dissipates, leaving viewers to focus on the drama and the action.Hence despite enjoying the experience the excitement is short-lived, when grey cells reboot and start decoding the senseless story, filled with admittedly riveting sequences and drama.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Almost as good as Casino!,"Beautifully shot and scored film.This movie reminded me a lot of Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight.I believe the director Sam Mendes even admitted that he took heavy inspiration from that film, but I'm okay with it!Iconic for sure, Adele's Skyfall song will forever be stuck in my head.For some reason this movie just feels so iconic and memorable. But the Home Alone style ending although not as big and bombastic as Quantum I felt it was simple and effective.There's a reason this made over a billion dollars in the box office.Casino is still better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"A work of art, in the fifty years of the Bond franchise","Directed by Sam Mendes and produced by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, it has script by Robert Wade, Neal Purvis and John Logan. This is the twenty-third film in the franchise and the third in the new era of James Bond, embodied by the participation of Daniel Craig as 007. It inherits the central cast of the previous films, which joins Ralph Fiennes, in the role of Gareth Mallory, Naomie Harris, in the role of Eve Moneypenny, Bérénice Marlohe in the role of bond- girl Severine and Albert Finney in the role of Kincade. This film marks the end of Judi Dench in the role of M (although she appeared on video in the movie ""Spectre""), and the resurgence of the character Q through the talent of Ben Whishaw. The role of the villain was handed to Javier Bardem.In this film, James Bond will protect the MI6, threatened by a huge leak that compromised the lives of several agents in the field, but he quickly finds that the responsible is pursuing directly M, and that they have scores to settle related to her past.This is one of the most impressive Bond films since the sixties. Rotated and released during the celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary of the franchise, it couldn't avoid the good memories, some of which have an important role in the plot, as happened to the ""old"" Aston Martin DB5 that Bond used in several films since ""Goldfinger"". Daniel Craig was excellent, giving life to a mature agent, unable to field missions under normal conditions, despite his perseverance and willpower. And if Judi Dench showed, in other films, that she is a tough and demanding boss, she showed now as she was also careful with her agents and her work. It's interesting and moving to see the way that she and Bond gradually collaborated, despite his arrogance and her criticism. Ben Whishaw surprised in the role of Q, giving his character a breath of fresh air and a much more realistic approach, appropriate to the age of technology. The villain, however, exceeded expectations. Bardem surpassed himself, and all he had shown in previous works. He could truly give life to his spiteful, vindictive and almost effeminate character. From here, the sky is the limit for this actor and the doors are open for any project he chooses. Interestingly, this is one of the few Bond movies where bond-girls lose their usual relevance, but it wasn't negative. By seeing the movie we will not miss them. The opening sequence is, in my opinion, very impressive and one of the best in all the franchise. It's accompanied by the song ""Skyfall"", composed and sung by Adele, one of the best British singers of today. With this song, she got an Oscar and one of her biggest hits to date.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Fun Film for a Thinking Mind,"I don'y want to write a review, but from what everyone else is saying on this god forbidden website, I have forced myself to do so. I think this is the best Bond film to date.What makes this film work so well, though, is not the intricate plot (which does have some issues), but the thematics and direction. Sam Mendes is not necessarily the best (I consider American Beauty to be very overrated), but he really deals with the script in a professional and wonderful matter. And with the help of the great Roger Deakins, Mendes makes this the most visually pleasing Bond film to date; showing what makes or breaks these films is not the lead, but the men behind the camera.Most importantly though, this is the most intelligent Bond film. Some serious themes are brought upon, such as redemption and the long battle of tradition vs. innovation. The redemption theme is rather obvious, but it is interestingly enough found within the three leads. Along with their blue eyes, M, Silva, and Bond, all are looking for redemption, but in different ways. This really develops the characters. The battle of old of new is also obvious, but I think more interesting. Not only does it provide a great way to include nostalgic Bond memorabilia, but it also has great commentary on spy films themselves. Spy films are so focused on technology, nowadays, that god awful CGI special effects take away from the film. Skyfall turns this on its head, showing that a spy film can be even better without all of the hustle and bustle of ""exploding pens"".Skyfall is far more than a James Bond film, and action films as a whole. Not only is it entertaining and visually pleasing, but also provides more to eat on for those who like to look at film analytically. If you have a good grasp on literature or film, then you should definitely check Skyfall out for a fun, yet thoughtful, ride.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Finally the classic Bond film that I remember from Childhood,"I wasn't planning to see this movie at all. I don't particularly like the latest Bond series from Daniel Craig at all. Strangely from the little I remember from the James Bond franchise is that James Bond is nothing like Daniel Craig or how Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace portrays.Anyway, as I was browsing IMDb, I see Skyfall has a rating of whooping 8.1. So I was like what heck let's trust the IMDb netizens and check this movie out. I gotta say, I'm impressed. I think Sam Mendes did a superb job on it. It's pretty resembles the Bond I remember. Not just packed the show with actions and explosions but a lot of witty conversation, classy scenes, and the usual classic backdrop and Bond's music. And I thought the plot itself is great too. It digs inside MI6 and Bond's personal life as the movie goes and give us a better understanding of everything. On top of that, I love the work on the cinematography too. I can feel like a lot of effort was put into obtaining beautiful and classy scenery and background. I'm no expert on all this kind of stuff but that's just how I feel when I see the movie. And a lot of scenes made me go ""wow, that's awesome!"".So all in all, it was worth it. Definitely should check it out. However, if you love the Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, you maybe a little disappointed with lack of actions and gadgets.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Where it all began,"After Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, here is the third movie with Daniel Craig starring as 007 James Bond.To be honest, I had quite a mix feelings when I pushed the theater door and took a seat. Casino Royale was a masterpiece, a fresh breath, a movie I love to watch anytime. Quantum of Solace was less successful, less entertaining. So I didn't know what to expect of Skyfall but as soon as the movie starts and I saw that familiar shape, I felt myself as watching a Bond movie again.This movie has the privilege to introduce two familiar characters, Moneypenny and Q. The first is now black but she is really sexy on her way and quite teasing which brings a lot of fun to the lines. She is also a field agent and knows how to handle a gun. That surprised me a lot and I kinda like the idea to be honest. Q on the other hand is odder. He is a geek, a kid and he is far less memorable than the original Q, Desmond Llewelyn. Q has the gift to bring humor within the movie but in Skyfall, all his jokes fall flat and he seems way too pretentious which will bring him to be played by the villain.Ah let's talk about the villain. What a relief to find someone who could match James Bond. Someone who was his image of the past and decided to take his revenge on M who sold him out to his enemies. Someone who knows MI6 like no one else and uses this knowledge to bring in down. Javier Bardem is by far one of the greatest villain we could have seen in a Bond Movie. He gives chills in every of his scene and was very convincing in his role. He gave a lot of challenge to James Bond and it was a guilty pleasure to see both engaging a fight for survival.Daniel Craig keeps being James Bond in his very skin. He is now experienced and enjoys a little bit of dark humor. But he is still as profound as in the other movies. It's also bringing a lot of good memories when he get back aboard the legendary DB7 from Goldfinger, THE James Bond car. That was delightful and depressing when we witness such a beautiful car being blown up at the end of the movie.So to conclude, when I left the theater, I was happy and relieved. Now I can't wait to see Spectre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Very good Bond film.,"(As everyone knows, it's a Bond film, so you do have to suspend a certain amount of disbelief - that should be an automatic tick-box on entry to the cinema.)Skyfall starts like a typical Bond, right in the heart of the action: chase scene, pretty girl and a glamorous location. It's beautifully choreographed and shot and gets proceedings off to a great start. This scenes sets up the rest of the film and leads us towards the thrilling climax.So, the bad:The middle section of this film is far too plodding. The story is not strong enough to justify the time spent telling it and I would have liked to have seen some sharper editing here. At 143mins this is a long film.There are some pretty large plot holes that left me scratching my head a bit and I find that a little strange that they were not thought through in a $200m production. There were also some large continuity and production errors that made me wince a bit.But, the good:The final section is, in my opinion, one of the best endings to any Bond. He shows resourcefulness, tenacity and expertise. The setting is wonderful and it fills in a tiny bit of Bond back history which is a new thing and actually handled rather well.The cinematography is universally great in this film. Wonderful lighting and locations and almost painterly in places.Judi Dench is wonderful.A proper villain. He's bonkers and brilliant and just steals the scenes.Rather good titles and title song by Adele. Brings back memories of Shirley Bassey.Overall: I enjoyed it. It was a bit long and could have lost some pounds in the middle section (couldn't we all?) but I thought it was up there with Casino Royale as one of my favourite Bond movies. Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond and Mendes obviously relished making this movie because of the care gone into it...which begs the question: why production errors and plot holes!?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Great Bond movie,"I have seen all of the Bond films and I thought this one was great. The film was focused more on MI6, M, Bond, a former top agent and the inner turmoil of MI6, M and Bond. I think the film also focused more on the personal side of the characters. No explosions, chase scenes, shootouts and all that other stuff was needed. This time the mission was personal to MI6, M, and Bond. Javier Badem played a fantastic Silva. We also got to look into Bond's past. Quite illuminating. The film also did a great job of transitioning from the old M to a new M. It was easier by having her die, instead of forcing her to retire. An African-American Moneypenny was also a great move.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Skyfall understands, admires, and elevates Bond to excellence and mastery to an unexpected level and unmatched by its predecessors.","Skyfall is The Dark Knight of Daniel Craig's James Bond films. Sam Mendes took all Casino Royale had built and elevated it to heights never before reached by Bond. Everything fires perfectly on all cylinders. The story is rich and delves further into the character of a bond than ever before. The action set pieces, the locales, and the cinematography are all masterpieces that establish Skyfall as an excellent James Bond film but take it further, placing it among the best movies of all time. Judi Dench's performance as M cements her legacy as a Bond great. And the excellent supporting cast grows with the brilliant casting and performances of Naomi Harris as Moneypenny, Ralph Fiennes as Mallory, and Ben Whishaw as Q. Still, the biggest standout is Javier Bardem as the villainous Silva - one of the greatest Bond antagonists of all time. His unpredictable and menacing nature is cloaked in a slightly goofy demeanor and skewed moral code. Skyfall asks and answers questions unlike any Bond before while staying true to what makes James Bond so compelling and entertaining. Just like The Dark Knight for Batman, even people who are not traditional Bond fans will be impressed with Skyfall.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Fabulous and fantastic,"We must forgive a few plot unlikelihoods, inconsistencies and not very well explained developments for the sake of the greatness of the visual features and aspects of this movie. The action scenes are fabulous and terrific, the camera movements, the cut and the images framing are excellent and the special and miniature effects overwhelming. Last but not least we have the splendid performance of a luxurious cast composed beside Daniel Craig as James Bond, by such great performers like Judi Dench, Ralph Fiennes, Javier Bardem and even the old veteran Albert Finney in a small part in the end. The story is about the theft by a terrorist group led by and ex-agent of MI6 of a computer drive with the identities of other agents and that must be retrieved by 007 at all costs since some of them are anonymously infiltrated in terrorist networks. The action is constant and takes place from Istanbul to the Scotttish Highlands passing through London, Shanghai and Macao. The chases are overpowering indeed. The movie opens with perhaps the most fantastic and fabulous chase I have ever seen on a movie including cars, motorcycles and even a train running in tunnels from time to time. And the plot has even (which is rare in this kind of movies) some moving personal sentimental aspects mainly in the last scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Contains theory that could be a spoiler if it's ever confirmed to be true??,"Skyfall (2012) -Daniel Craig's backside was still looking fantastic, but the short haircut he had been given was a bit severe. It was like they had deliberately aged his character to fit with all of the retirement suggestions. He was still incredibly sexy and suave though, with that wicked charm of his too but I still believed that his sunglasses were too small for his face.While the story had some small similarities to some of the other spy films out there, it was delivered so well that it was hard to notice.Having watched this one for only the second time I think that it might actually be my favourite Bond film, because it delivers so much and so satisfactorily. Without 'Casino Royale's' (2006) character and format establishing and the relationship building in 'Quantum Of Solace' (2008) it couldn't have hoped to be so good, but I felt that the production team, writers and directors all seemed to have a clear view of how to make this one chapter outstanding. It's like how 'Austin Powers: Goldmember' (2002) was definitely the best, but you wouldn't have a clue about half of the jokes if wasn't for 'International Man Of Mystery' (1997) and to a lesser extent 'The Spy Who Shagged Me' (1999).I really loved it this film though. For me, it had everything that would usually appear and more, because of M's involvement. I really appreciated the fact the focus was on M as much as Bond and Judi delivered a fantastic depiction of her character. It wouldn't have been possible to have utilised M in the other Bonds, because, while they played the part as written and directed, they just didn't have the spunk and presence that Dame Dench delivered here.What I also liked was that it seemed to be deliberately closing off chapters of previous Bond's, bringing a sort of end to some of the iconic elements, but also introducing new characters or actors taking older roles, so that I knew that the franchise would continue, but that it could be updated slightly where needed.In my opinion, Ben Whishaw was not the right choice for Q, but probably because I just don't get along with the characters he's played. He was a very arrogant character too, but I preferred him this, the second time around.And Javier Bardem was so freaky looking and scary at the best of times and in that respect he made a very good bad guy, but I just don't think that I'd like him either.I'm torn about where to put this on my own Top Films list, because it really did tick a lot of the good boxes, but I also loved 'Casino Royale' a lot, so it's a tough call to say where this one, as the sequel, would sit. Perhaps they will end up sat next to each other as equally scored? I usually don't score follow ons very highly, because the very essence of the film is not an original idea.Spoiler Theory??There did appear to be some ambiguity surrounding whether M may have been James' Mother, with lots of hints and suggestions that definitely had me wondering and that I thought would explain their familiarity and connection to this point.956.33/1000.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Craig needs rehab extra star for Bi Bond--,"Production Budget: $200 million World Total Gross: $1,1 billionThe reviews especially the one star ones are fun to read as people dissect the plot holes, I grade things a little differently since no Bond movie has ever been believable....I grade them on how much they make me laugh especially the outrageous bad women and villains who used to work for Spectre. Yes, I love the bad guys. But also the British stuffiness well any of the outrageous stuff is often funny.This movie did not make me laugh once did it bore me? (my second criteria). Yes about half way through I started looking to see how much time was left...and by the time they got to Scotland it took a lot of restraint not to fast forward it. The villain in this one was fun but you know his fate. He was the only interesting character.This movie was very successful so what do I know? Cost $200 million and grossed $1.1 billion. I notice that there is the requisite Shanghai scenes indicating China is an important market.It's probably an above average Bond movie....so I give it a 6.5 It gets however an extra star for Bond saying ""Who said it would be the first time"" -- So 7.5 an honorary 8 rounded up--Craig sure looks like drink and drugs have taken a toll--bulbous nose and all--they better dry him out good--or he will be retired like Dench. Ironic that he recently played a role he has now become: Flashbacks of a Fool (an older actor ruined by drugs and drink and general debauchery) Yes, I know he also had sort of that role in this movie...but look close they didn't need much makeup to make him look the part.I am sorry I did laugh once, Dench made me laugh when she said to Craig about his Aston Martin...""I suppose that will be completely inconspicuous"".

Another Bond G.O.A.T. courtesy of Craig (and Dench),"Sam Mendes manages to redeem the Craig era after QoS dropped the ball, and smashes it out of the park with another one of the best Bond's ever made.Once again, as with Casino Royale, Skyfall is chocked full with fantastic action setpieces, great acting all around, appropriate humour, a magnificent villain and a great plot. What sets this one apart from the latter is perhaps the scale, as Skyfall feels much grander than Casino's perhaps more lower-radar story.Though Craig gives a fantastic performance as always, the real credit should go to Dench. This is the best justice the M character has ever been given, and Skyfall really fleshes her out beyond just being Bond's superior.Equally great is Javier Bardem as Mr Silva, who falls just behind Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre in terms of greatness. He is the megalomaniacal schemer done right in my opinion, and I very much prefer him to the likes of Blofeld and others.And who could forget the intro theme? The most iconic by miles, and unironically a great song - it almost feels like a spiritual successor to Shirley Bassey's work, but still stands on its own feet. So good that the next two films basically tried to copy what Adele managed to pull off, to little success.The only thing that rather erked me was the mishandling of the Moneypenny character. Her character isn't a field agent, but there's nothing wrong with that, and they should have just created an original character for Naomie Harris to play.It is also an absolute crime that Sean Connery didn't return to the franchise as Kincade, as planned, but some things just weren't meant to be.Overall, one of the best James Bond films in the franchise.

007 Rises,"I don't want to add to the ""Quantum of Solace"" dog pile that seems to be forming by every other critic writing a ""Skyfall"" review, but what I will say is, next to Quantum, ""Skyfall"" should be considered as the Bond franchise getting back on track; with the help of an Academy Award winning director. With Daniel Craig (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo)reprising his role as the best James Bond ever and Judi Dench (Notes on a Scandal) reprising her role as M, ""Skyfall"" (in a curious turn of events) sees Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Revolutionary Road) taking the helm, directing the darkest and most beautifully shot film of the series. Known for his intimate dramas, Mendes' rendition focuses less on getting the ""bad guy"" or on Bond girls (I am aware that Bond has multiple affairs in this film, but none of them are very prominent) and more on the internal struggles of an aging Bond. And along with the new era 007 stable of script writers, but this time excluding Paul Haggis (Crash, Million Dollar Baby) which is one of the missteps this film, ""Skyfall"" should be seen as an overall success...even if it leaves some audiences checking their watches.The Plot: After a direct terrorist attack on the M16 building, Bond attempts to find out who is behind it all. But when he discovers that the perpetrator (played brilliantly by Javier Bardem) may have a direct link to M herself, his loyalty to her is truly tested. There is also a subplot, that only Mendes could get away with, dealing with British intelligence who are seen as unnecessary dinosaurs and Bond who has lost a step or two after a friendly-fire gunshot wound leaves him questioning his life as a Double O agent (I am not ruining anything that is not in the trailer or in an IMDb synopsis already). And if you think this subplot sounds a little too dramatic to be in a Bond film, then you may cringe when I inform you that this introspective storyline runs a majority of the show during the large gaps in action in the first hour or so. Suffice to say, the film does get much better after it's rather slow beginnings, culminating in arguably the best/most visually stunning final half hour yet.Side Note: Even though ""Skyfall"" as a whole gets better as it progresses, I can soundly say that this is not the Bond film that will convert anybody who was not a Bond fan or British already. I am sorry to say, that due to some pitfalls this movie runs into along the way, some audiences may even find themselves becoming a bit bored.Yes, ""Skyfall"" does pay homage to past (or future) films, it does contain the corny one-liners that are expected from a James Bond adventure (only this time they are even drier and more alienatingly British than in the past two Bond films) and Bond is still a womanizing, Captain save awell you know the rest. But there is an issue, which plagues ""Skyfall"" throughout. The disjointedness of many prominent scenes will undoubtedly cause confusion amidst Bond lover and novice alike. In fact, there is a major scene involving Bond, which happens within the first ten minutes (if you've seen it, then you know what I'm talking about) that is never explained, and really left me scratching my head as to what the point of that particular plot twist was (I wish I could say more, but I don't want to be accused of spoiling anything). Aside from this very distracting plot hole (one you could drive a truck through) there are other moments, when Bond ventures off on a mission and it takes two to three minutes into each scene to figure out why he is where he is, what the mission is and who the characters he interacts with are. These major lapses in story structure should be attributed to the lackluster script put forth by the normally witty Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan; a script that will mistakenly be interpreted as quite sharp because of its redeeming finale.Javier Bardem: Playing not only one of the most scene stealing villains since Heath Ledger's Joker, as well as reviving what we know to be the classic Bond villain; when Bardem's character Silva is introduced around the second act, his uniquely flamboyant brand of villainy brings this movie back to life (no pun intended). I can't say this loud enough: Javier Bardem is the best part of this movie, and if anything, his flawless and award worthy performance is one of the only reasons I am recommending ""Skyfall"".Final Thought: I am not claiming to be a Bond expert, or to have an intimate knowledge of Ian Fleming's characters, but as a member of the movie going public I would say that ""Skyfall"" contains one of the best Bond anthems of any Bond movie (""Skyfall"" sung by Adele) the best villain of any Bond movie and the bravest/most visually interesting direction (mostly visible in the final half hour) of any Bond film to date. But is this the best Bond film ever? No. ""Goldfinger"" is better, ""From Russia with Love"" is better and ""Casino Royale"" is one of the best. As an overall film, ""Skyfall"" is good but not great...especially not as great as many of my fellow critics, blinded by Mendes' past work, are making it out to be.Follow me on Twitter @moviesmarkus",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

The good news continues for SKYFALL also grossing film debut in the history of Brazil.With so many records were broken as well as the positive reviews on the film, it is quite possible circulation in America later would be hugely successful. For comparison Casino Royale won 40 million dollars (USD 380 billion) in its preamble. The last Bond film, Quantum Of Solace scored a 67 million dollar (USD 635.5 billion). Let's wait how the results for Skyfall later.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond is back where he belongs!,"OK, so I finally watched Skyfall after a long and painful four year gap. When I heard they were going to bring the old Bond back with gadgets, more Bond humor, etc. I was very thrilled. But the first teaser trailer sort of felt like this same dark side of Bond. But I went to the cinema, watched the movie and was completely stunned to put it mildly! Sam Mendes impresses with his brilliant and tireless direction, Thomas Newman made a fine job with the new score, Adele made a brilliant Bond song and Roger Deakins sure as hell did a good job with the cinematography!Mendes really redefines Bond 100% percent to the better! A good old throwback to the sixties! Skyfall is at least as good as Casino Royale and beats the crap out of Quantum of Solace! You can't really help that a flow of nostalgia hits you when watching this fine masterpiece!The only thing I will say about the plot, is that the movie starts out with an assassin stealing a list of all undercover NATO operatives! A classic and phenomenal Bond chase through Istanbul ensues, where Bond gets shot and disappears! MI6 then comes under attack and Bond resurfaces to find them responsible and bring them to justice! The plot is in fact very simple and very smooth. I can't imagine you're gonna get thrown off.As mentioned, Roger Deakins' cinematography is very well done, providing you with the best 007 image to date! Newman's score is very subtle in its own way, but still very ""bond-ish"". Sam Mendes directs Skyfall with finesse and dedication, and he can also make action look beautiful (especially that first part)! My only regret is that they use too much CGI in the post-credit scene, which is very sad, because the only purpose it serves, is to show a background, when an unnecessary closeup of Craig on a bike ensues. The sound and sound mixing is fantastic, and so is the editing! Very few gripes in the technical department.The screenwriters really give Craig the opportunity to redefine his Bond, giving him more depth and making him so much more emotional. Craig masters this in every scene in this movie and puts his fingerprint as one of the best Bond actors (if not the best) so far. Javier Bardem is also really brilliant in this movie. His acting is a little over-blown at times, but he still delivers a great performance! Bardem is a classic Bond villain, but still makes Silva his own. Unfortunately Naomie Harris and Bérenicé Marlohe fall for the same trap. Not enough screen time. They aren't really important to the story, which makes you stop caring about them. Their performances are solid, though. Judi Dench IS the real Bond babe in this film (not meant literally). She's much more personal and much more emotional in Skyfall. Ben Whishaw as Q was also a positive surprise! Ralph Fiennes, Albert Finney, Helen McCrory, Rory Kinnear, and Ola Rapace also fill out brilliantly supporting roles.Sam Mendes has set the standards for how the next Bond movie should be, which makes it so much easier for the next directors (if Sam Mendes doesn't return for the next project that is). The movie has in its own glory, celebrated the 50th anniversary for James Bond, in the best possible way! Skyfall is a brilliant and classic Bond film, but I still miss the feel and formula ""Casino Royale"" introduced us to back in 2006...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond Is Back,"Bond is back. Was there ever any doubt about it? Skyfall is a magnificent return to form for Bond and in the franchise's 50th year anniversary is almost certainly going to be considered one of the best Bond movies ever.Skyfall is brilliantly acted, well paced, with some touches of dry humour and some great references to Bond movies past. Visually, the movie is stunning with some beautiful locations Shanghai and Macau being the standout places.Sam Mendes has made his name through excellent art house movies, yet this is the British director's first British movie. An accomplished theatre director, Mendes is a real actors director and has got great performances out of his cast. Mendes is a rare director who rarely does a bad movie, and although Jarhead was perhaps a little misjudged, American Beauty, Revolutionary Road and Road to Perdition are masterpieces.Craig is the best Bond and the best actor to play Bond. He is an experienced, rough around the edges and dangerous Bond who is entirely believable. Judi Dench has more to do than ever in this movie and her stunning performance should surely receive recognition. Bardem impresses and chews scenery as a very interesting villain whilst Naomi Harris and Bernice Marlohe are gorgeous as two very important characters. The cast is rounded off with a hugely effective role for Ralph Fiennes and Ben Whishaw as the new Q. Even Albert Finney pops up to lend hugely experienced support in the gripping finale.Bond is back, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Stunning!,"I went to see this film on the premier opening night at the Xtreme Screen At Vue. Full capacity, sold out and excellent atmosphere. The whole film is just a wow factor throughout. Daniel Craig's grittiness matches the dark essence of the film. The acting was spot on throughout and the effects could not be flawed and were some of the very best I have ever seen. It feeds into previous bond films showing respect to the 50 year anniversary of the biggest franchise in the world.Light humour every known and again gives the audience a sense that the film is not taking itself to seriously. Overall this film is simply a must see movie, and arguably the best bond film of all time, except for gold finger.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A great James Bond film,"This film is about James Bond having to crack down on an invisible enemy who is terrorising the MI6 through hacking.Right from the introductory scene, before the opening credits, there is already much action. No expense is spared, and no action is over the top. In just a space of a few minutes, they must have wrecked ten cars while rummaging through the heart of Istanbul. Its intensity gets the adrenaline pumping quickly. In the opening credits, Adele's song is haunting and atmospheric, building up the tension and anticipation of what is to come.Learning from the mistake of the ultra fast paced ""Quantum of Solace"", ""Skyfall"" is a normal paced thriller that keeps on moving but does not lose you. It keeps you on edge throughout, but not too attention-deficit that makes you lost in the myriad of subplots. The character portrayals are great, much detail is put on making characters real. The story is thrilling and engaging, 2.5 hours breezed past without me noticing how long it was. It is noteworthy that Bond has moved with the times, as he does not rely on gadgets anymore, but on information technology. There is even a reference on how gadgets are so last century! I enjoyed ""Skyfall"" a lot, and I am already looking forward to the next Bond film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond... what the f*ck happened?,"SPOILER WARNING!! Ready realized now that Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace was the best Bond films, especially the Casino Royale. In Skyfall Bond is almost in retirement. The movie even starts well but loses interest and becomes sluggish in half an hour, too much politics involved in the British secret services. The Bond into Bourne mode of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace disappears ... Bond enters cure hangovers in poor shape mode. The Bond-Girl is only good for sex in the shower and to take the Bond villain's lair which is a desert island (nothing ever has been seen repeatedly in the Bond Sean Connery 60s) Adrenaline movie summarizes the initial chase and the capture of villain're equal to the Dark Knight's Christopher Nolan. This villain that although well played by Javier Bardem think it was needless to show your feminine side shall we say, a bit more even changed the decor of the house of Bond, or his wardrobe. A Bond villain has to want more than just a personal vendetta against the chief of the British secret service has to be really cold, calculating and capable of atrocities. In a good Bond movie he needs to be taken out of the comfort zone, his normal environment and be placed in another country or continent, to be put in extreme situations where he has to make tough decisions and use all his skills and training. Anyway I hope the next one is better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the best Bond films ever made.,"I have long been a fan of the James Bond franchise. I was brought up with the Pierce Brosnan Bond movies. The first one I ever saw was Goldeneye, from that moment I was hooked. But his movies got worse as they went on, being a Bond fan I liked them all, but I had to admit they were getting worse. This culminated with Die Another Day. It was at this stage a reboot was needed. I was wary of Craig at first, I didn't think he would cut it as Bond. I really liked Casino Royale but I felt it was a tad overrated. Maybe it's because I wasn't used to this more darker human Bond. Quantum of Solace was a step down from Casino Roayle, and I felt this could be the end of Craig's Bond. I was wary that the critics were overselling Skyfall, and that it would be not as good as they said. I am happy to report, I was totally wrong.Skyfall is in my opinion one of the very best Bond films ever made, arguably the best. A blistering pre-credits sequence, in which Daniel Craig destroys half of Istanbul in a quest to recover sensitive information from an enemy operative, initially suggests Bond is back on track after the stuttering blip that was Quantum Of Solace. No sooner are we settled though, when James is shot in error by one of his own (Naomie Harris), plunging from the roof of a moving train into the opening title filled with skulls, tombstones and other totems of death.Bond survives, of course – he always does. But when he comes back to life he is far from his best, Craig's unshaven chops and bloodshot eyes betraying a man whose heart isn't in it (if it ever was).It doesn't help that Judi Dench's M also looks set for the scrap heap, or that the new Q (Ben Whishaw) is a techno-nerd barely half his age. (""You still have spots!"" sneers Bond contemptuously during their first encounter in the National Gallery.) Put through his paces after some Mediterranean down- time involving scorpion-baiting drinking games and post-shag Heineken, 007 can hardly manage a chin-up before collapsing in a heap. He can't even dangle from the undercarriage of an ascending elevator without wincing in discomfort. If Casino Royale was Bond finding his footing, Skyfall is him remembering where he left it - a clever turnaround made all the more effective by giving 007 an adversary who, for much of the film, is crossing the finish line while Jimmy's putting on his trainers. With his shock of blond hair, dodgy dentistry and vengeful M fixation, Javier Bardem's Silva is that rarest of creations: a cyber-terrorist who genuinely terrifies. But he also has a playful side; witness the literally thigh-rubbing glee he brings to one stand-out interrogation scene. It's far from the only sexually charged moment, cue a steamy shower clinch with Bérénice Marlohe's femme fatale Sévérine, plus some saucy banter with Harris' Eve that positively fizzes with winking innuendo. But in line with Craig's summer assignment at Buckingham Palace, the real Bond girl is of a more seasoned vintage: Dame Judi herself, here evolving from 007's testy taskmistress into a surrogate mother he will kill to protect. The casting of Dench was always a master-stroke, but it has taken seven outings, and one Oscar-winning filmmaker, for her to be exploited properly. Mendes' ambitions, though commendable, don't always fit the material. The Bond series has lasted half a century without referencing Shakespeare, Tennyson and JMW Turner, so why shoehorn them in now? Thankfully they don't interfere with the standard Bondian trappings, Skyfall boasting all the glamour, excitement and exoticism we have come to expect and then some. A floating Macau casino, complete with firework display and komodo dragons, supplies a perfect setting for cocktails, fisticuffs and Live And Let Die in-jokes, while Bardem's hide-out - a deserted island full of crumbling masonry and broken statues - has all the grandeur of Blofeld's volcano with none of the impracticality.A splendid mid-section in London, meanwhile, spurns the city's overexposed architecture for a chase beneath its surface, Bond pursuing Silva via sewer, tunnel and Tube while still finding time to crack the odd funny. Indeed, for all its intimations of mortality and harping on obsolescence, Skyfall is more often than not a hoot, Craig having the confidence at last to lace his Bond's killer instinct with a bone-dry wit and wry nonchalance. The scene where he contemplates utilising one of the series' oldest and most famous gizmos is a perfectly judged grace note, while an appearance from Albert Finney near the end of the picture exudes warmth and good humour. It all adds up to the 007 adventure we've been waiting for: a flawlessly assembled thrill ride with a cast to die for and a nakedly emotional undertow. Happy birthday, Mr Bond. Here's to another 50 years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Not your typical Bond film,"Every new James Bond film that comes out claims to be the ""best Bond ever,"" and even if ""Skyfall"" maybe isn't the best ever. Its certainly one off the better ones. As well as being the best one for a while.Some may argue that ""Casino Royale"" was awesome. But I was underwhelmed by it almost as much as everyone else seemed to be by Daniel Craigs second outing as 007 in ""Quantum of solace"" (Which despite having the worst title ever, I thought was better). ""Skyfall"" is trying to capture again what worked for the best in ""Casino Royale."" It has the plot focus on the earlier days off Bond and gives the character an interesting back-story. Starting off by getting the over the top action out off the way, before getting on with telling a more realistic plot.""Casino Royale"" had way too much card playing for my liking. But despite ""Skyfall"" having a similar slump a mere half hour into it (I'm not interested in seeing Bond get laid again. Get on with the ACTION!) most off the film works for the better. The action is nearly always interesting, and builds toward a great finale. Something which a lot off Bonds get wrong by having Bond invade yet another bad-guys fortress. There's a successful jokey side to the movie. Another thing the series can sometimes get wrong, and this Bonds good eventful story, shows you they've really pushed the Boat out in not wanting this to be ""Just another Bond film.""It may go a little overboard with trying to be modern but then again the Aston Martins appearance makes up for that, and the films so full off surprises you can almost forgive it for having a camp bad-guy and some terrible CGI iguanas in it for some reason.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
I live in a different universe,"I usually read a few existing IMDb reviews before writing one myself and that is how I came to the conclusion that I live in a different universe to most of you. Despite Skyfall's high (8.1) rating it seems that most of the reviews posted are highly negative, not to say downright hostile. Clearly I live in a different universe and saw a different film to most of you.In the universe that I inhabit I was able to watch all the Bond movies as they came out – that's right, it may be the 50th anniversary but I'm so old I saw them all on release. In my universe there isn't a single Bond film that had a decent plot or one that made any sense or had much relationship to normal life. In fact they were distinguished by their utter lack of verisimilitude, plot cohesion and utter preposterousness. For the naysayers on this Bond film to cite lack of believability or plot holes and to complain that the villain is a camp cypher who spends precious time filling in exposition and threatening bond with some unlikely fate (sharks, teeth, laser beams anyone?) instead of putting a bullet through his head proves that they have never seen any Bond film ever shown in my universe. The absolute cornerstone of any Bond movie plot is that it is nonsensical guff that no sane person would ever believe. Even the actor who plays Bond changes every few years – how's that for lack of continuity?For dwellers in the universe I live in I wish to inform you that this is indeed probably the best Bond film ever made. There are some exciting action sequences which match anything that has been done in previous Bond films; Craig is still the definitive Bond for our time; the plot is exciting and involving though containing no more believable logic than any previous Bond film. It's stylish and well directed and the cast are uniformly excellent.What really made this film the best Bond in my estimation are the elements I suspect a lot of others didn't like. It does not go mad with CGI and often uses miniatures instead (though Craig's face superimposed on the motorbike stunt guy was clunky). It doesn't give Bond a load of unlikely gadgets and it relies on characters and the good old standbys of guns and vehicles.To complain that the plot of a Bond film was illogical or the villain ridiculous makes as much sense as complaining that Strictly Come Dancing contained elements of choreography.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Very Disappointed!,"Great scenes, good conversations, good execution but after the promising first half hour the main story is just so dull. Javier Bardem acted well but his character was the worst..blonde villain with an accent, thought we were past this. Whatever happened to the great main story of the first two? I thought it was supposed to be a trilogy! They left the first two unfinished. I would rather have watched Casino Royale (which is by far the best action movie ever made) again for the 20th time instead... Hopefully the IMDb rating will go down eventually from 8.1 as more people go to see it, but I it's currently way too high..too many people are raving about it, probably because it's just like an old bond movie with many good but pointless and not connected scenes following each other..casino royale was a breath of fresh air, but unfortunately unique and didn't get the sequels it deserved..",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A wink to all past James Bond of the last 50 years,"Skyfall does score for many reasons here: Daniel Craig stills shines as James Bond. If the character went into several actors (I still remember Sean Connery and Roger Moore among others), Craig does it best.However, the story is very well told, with some action. Mostly the main point is how low the MI6 can go when they abandon agents. If they abandon Silva to its fate, James Bond does not surrender at all and remains faithful, even if sometimes he has doubts about why he is still around.Many ""hints"" from past James Bond movies are showing here: exotic destinations, a bit of gadgetry (not much however), a new ""Q"", Bond girls, all kinds of peril, a mission to accomplish, Bond's intelligence, a bit of humour. This is what the James Bond series was all about for 50 years (and there is a tribute at the end for this Golden Anniversary).And of course to top it off: Adele which sings the theme song. She deserves it as well as past singers.Not to miss if you're a 007 fan",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Are they trying to kill the franchise ?,"A little late to the party.Let me first point out, I consider Daniel Craig as best bond. I was going in this film with great anticipation.What we got was exact opposite. The main problem with this movie was script was very weak. The intentions of Silva were clear from the get go. But still we were fooled to believe something more is there. Silva looked more like a comic villain. Nothing more than enhancement factor for bond.The technical area sucks bull. They didn't have much gadgets in the film. But the technical discussion could have been handled properly.I like the ending fight sequence. That was old school Bond style fight with great special effects. Though it was much needed because during rest of the film Bond never looked his former self.The ending made no sense at all. I was hoping that this ending would come sooner. Frankly the whole movie was filled with loop holes.This movie won't get counted in top half of bond franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
where has James bond gone?,"I just came back from watching the movie with my brother and i must say that we were both very disappointed with it. Although i am pleased to say that this is not the worst of them. i need to declare that for me this movie was the last nail in the bond Coffin. I think that putting Daniel Craig in bonds shoes Symbolizes the downhill slope that the movies were going to take from that moment on. The James bond we all grew to love and admire, the one who used his wits and charms before going for his fists or guns is gone,and all is left is just a thug with a gun and no charm at all. All the suspense is now completely gone from the movies and in every plot you just know his going to go for his gun or kick someone when he runs out of ammo. Where is the mystery the swagger the old bond which i grew up wanting to be,charming the ladies and his enemies with a smile and some Witty line, not just a hail of Bullets and blood up to his ears. sorry, i won't be seeing any more bond movies because clearly the magic is gone, it's just a plain bad old action movie with good stunts and effects, marvelous scenery and nothing more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Bond as We Know Him, Yet Not Quite.","""Skyfall"", directed by the Oscar–winning Sam Mendes, is the twenty third James Bond film. It's a series that celebrates fifty years of motion picture history, its origins stretch back to the early nineteen-fifties when former spy Ian Fleming penned the first of fourteen Bond novels, ""Casino Royale"". When it was revealed in 1961 that President John F. Kennedy was a huge fan of the novel ""From Russia with Love"", 007 became an international success that spawned in the following year the first in the phenomenally popular adaptations for the silver screen: ""Dr. No"".""Skyfall"", in many ways, has more in common with these earlier films than the later ones: the Aston Martin DB5 is back (as used in ""Goldfinger"" [1964]) as well as the ice cool style of Bond himself.As Bond, Daniel Craig is terrific: debonair, yet tough enough to be believable when he abandons a dying field agent. His performances in ""Casino Royale"" (2007) and ""Quantum of Solace"" (2009) are built upon to deliver a complex character and not a geriatric punster that Roger Moore was close to creating in his later outings. He brings depth and a steely emotionalism to the role.Javier Bardem as the villain is perhaps the best in years, giving us a complex creation that has a goal so much more interesting than the resolutely generic world domination plans of so many Bond adversaries. The Oscar-winning actor is superb here, his intense performance destined to be regarded as a classic.Judi Dench, another Oscar winner, gives her finest portrayal of ""M""; her prominence and well-written dialogue ensure that she is the real ""Bond-girl"".Others, such as Ben Whishaw, Bérénice Marlohe and Ralph Fiennes are all excellent, making this the finest all-round acted James Bond film ever.However, pride of place for kudos is the Academy Award winning director Sam Mendes who has brought to life a top-flight thriller first and foremost, never overplaying his action scenes. In that respect, one might wonder if Mendes is harking back to the ""New Hollywood"" movement of the seventies as well as older, classic Bonds. He is suitably aided by nine time Oscar nominee Roger Deakins doing the cinematography that really gives an assured feel to all of the film's locations, making you feel the cold, wet damp of Scotland, the grey November of London and the gaudy modern cities of Asia.Why this James Bond film is so good is because Mendes has realised that this needs to be a good thriller in the first place, one that works on its own as well as a continuation of the diverse adventures of 007, licensed to kill.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

James Bond is no Shawshank Redemption....,"I've heard lots of negative comments coming from this film. Someone said that they weren't going to watch this film because he heard that the film had, ""too many plot holes and was overall tried to be arty."" I'm having none of that and I forced him to watch it and the guy enjoyed it immensely. Just like I guessed. The truth is, the film is terrific, it is powerful as a stand alone film with the much needed elements which make a Bond film so enjoyable in the first place. You really feel like the Bond team have put everything they've got into making a film for the 50 Year anniversary of the Bond film franchise. It really pays off and during the ending credits my mouth was wide open. Daniel Craig gives another show-stealing performance, his dark and moody looks mixed in with his funny one-liners will remind you of Sean Connery. M as Judi Dench gives her best performance of M out of the seven films she's been in as playing Bond's boss. I would also go as far as saying that it was one of her best performances full stop. Raoul Silva played by Jarvier Bardem might give you flashbacks of the Joker, but he brings his own twist to the character and he would of stolen the movie if the other characters weren't perfect. Bill Tanner gets a decent amount of screen time and you get to understand his character in this movie. To tell the truth, there's more characterization and emotions shown in this movie then in all of Roger Moore's 7 Bond films. It works, really well and that's all that is important. People have heard about this and are expecting Shawshank's level of themes and ideas. But, no, the film has a slight melancholy theme and the film approaches the idea about sometimes old is better then new but this just improves the storyline. If you haven't seen it, get it out now! It has enough in the film for Die hard Bond fans (like me) to get excited about little scenes and references as well as pleasing action movie fans. The action is really good and clear. No shaky-camera Bourne stuff in the film. The score, by Thomas Newman done the job well and reminds me a little of the great John Barry and the Adele song is sure to be another Bond song great up there with Goldfinger by Shirley Bassey and For Your Eyes Only by Sheena Easton. Best Bond film ever? Quite possibly on many people's lists.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
21st Century Man,"I don't know much about James Bond. Sure, I can tell you about S-sssean Connery, I can hum the theme, I can recognize an Aston Martin and a shaken martini, but I actually haven't seen many of the films. Heck I was born recognizing Pierce Brosnan as the definitive James Bond look, playing Nightfire in junior school. To be honest, I've only seen Quantum of Solace and hated it.Skyfall has made me a believer. For all its necessities: guns, cars, girls and chases, Skyfall is more. Skyfall is smart.Skyfall tells a sharp, straightforward story that blends elements exquisitely, with a brilliantly flowing opening chase that transfers to scenes of dialogue and plot development, then back to action... the mix is smooth, with cause and effect, drama to action. There is also some comedy laced in, akin to Nolan's Batman series, clearly an influence on this film. Skyfall has many memorable scenes, my favourite being the hotel in Shanghai. The action is always creative, the fights mesmerizing. I'm sure I'll see- if not try- the iconic subway slide one of these nights.The cinematography is brilliant, distractingly so. Clever and effective, you will be amazed at how the film is shot and how colour is used- I'll nod to Shanghai again.The acting is really something for such a blockbuster. Craig brings a very human Bond, who surprises you more than once. Skyfall looks into the past of James Bond- how does someone become a secret agent? I haven't seen Casino Royale, but after the horrible Quantum he now looks incredibly comfortable in the role. The 'style check' train jump at the beginning and throwback ride show this.Judi Dench sees lots of screen time in her 7th appearance as M, this time as a pivotal plot point, more than just mission control. She never lets her guard down, always with a look of bulldog ferocity. This cuts screen time from the Bond girls, but that's because, I have to give credit to IGN here, that M is the Bond girl of Skyfall.After his incredible turn as Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Men, it would'v e been easy to see Javier Bardem as a vengeance-seeking ex- agent. But that's not what happened, far from it. I think Bardem's Silva will catch everyone in the theatre off-guard, in at least one way. His introductory scene is incredible, his speech chilling. His character is unsettling, his appearance ghastly, but inside he's smart, and it's his mind that really holds his menace. He's a justified villain and a very worthy opponent.Thematically, Skyfall smartly chooses to acknowledge technology. The film deals with the irrelevance of humans in conflict, and the prevalence of computers. The old in society being displaced by the young, the technologically- minded. The topic is interesting on its own, but in context it's brilliant. James Bond is a 50 year tradition, now forced to change with the world. Skyfall is the start of a new Bond era.If nothing else, Skyfall is an engaging and satisfying film. But it's more than that, it speaks about our changing society, examines relationships usually forgotten in Bond films, and features incredible actors and technical work. So it's really more than a Bond film, it's a modern landmark. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Excellent!... We're back!...,"A film that brings Bond back to its roots with many old characters re- stated by the end; I'm certain it will please many long-standing fans like myself. The story does have quite a lot of emotional depth both for Bond and for M as they are forced to face their past. A highly enjoyable film that stretches all the emotions; everything from laughter to despair; I loved it! Well worth a look – It has my seal of approval, which, coming from a man who, if he used his middle name and mother's maiden name would be called James Bond Think on.SteelMonster's verdict: VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 9.4/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Good action flick, but hardly a masterpiece","I'm not a Bond fan, but I did like Casino Royale quite a bit (the less said about Quantum of Solace, the better). Skyfall got reviews like you wouldn't believe, far surpassing anything in this series before, so I was excited to see it. It is, I must say, pretty good, though the praise seems a tad ridiculous. It's good for a Bond flick. It's nothing special beyond that. In fact, I think I liked Casino Royale better (neither is a film I'd ever bother rewatching). Skyfall is very entertaining, but there's nothing here putting it above the average blockbuster. The story is thin and rather silly, all kinds of clichés are hit upon and there are plenty of completely unbelievable stunts. Laughable moments include Bond using a terrible CGI Komodo dragon as a step-stool and characters desperately trying to escape the bad guys flipping around a flashlight in the darkness like a homing beacon. Javier Bardem gives another good baddie performance, though he comes off as kind of a Batman villain here - he's able to convince hundreds of faceless henchmen to die for his very personal cause for, I don't know, money, I guess. I hope their families got paid, anyway. I seem pretty negative, but it's only because I think it's overrated, not bad. One thing I absolutely loved was the look. Filmed by Roger Deakins, it is one of the most beautiful blockbusters I can think of.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Why this movie is important, and a phenomenal James Bond Movie","Reading many of the reviews by other reviewers, began to make me confused as to what people have come to expect from a Bond movie. Speaking for myself, the baseline has always been the action. As I became older, I found myself watching the Bond movies in a new light, becoming equally interested in the story lines and the character development. However, previous Bond movies had always left me wanting something more in how Bond is portrayed. Previous Bond films, even when attempting to show the emotional side of Bond, have always left the viewer feeling as an outsider looking in. The viewer merely watched Bond and his actions and took them for what they were, there was never any deeper understanding as to what and who Bond truly was. For this reason, I began reading the Fleming novels, and that missing piece of the puzzle was found. Skyfall accomplished this as well. The James Bond portrayed in Skyfall is the closest example to Fleming's character in which he put tireless detail over 50 years ago. For the first time I saw a true man, not a superman or a super secret agent. Daniel Craig bridged this gap and brought the written James Bond into the cinema. He understands Bond. In addition, this movie carries everything that one expects from a Bond movie. The action scenes are absolutely impressive. The story is solid. If you are a Bond fan that needs a bad guy with a finger on the nuclear detonator, you may disagree. This is a simple enemy, motivated by a simple reason and looking to accomplish a simple goal. This movie is the complete package, with tasteful nostalgia that I found spectacularly used (unlike Die Another Day).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Old-school Bond - Welcome back!,"Briefly - This one will take you back to the time when the good Bond movies were based on a relatively simple plot, great villains, pretty girls and the focus stayed on getting rid of the bad guy at all cost.Don't buy into these nay-sayers claiming the plot doesn't make sense or that the movie abandons ideas before they fully develop - nonsense! The only reason they are saying that is because they are too ignorant to figure things out on their own.If you want to enjoy a Bond movie where 007 is not some Super-Spy-World-Is-At-An-End heroic figure, but instead is brought into play because the villain needs to die - this one is for you.I enjoyed the gritty edge to this one and a plot that stays the course, with the usual mix of a few fantastic chase/fight scenes and some good twists to keep you sharp. Keep makin' 'em like this one and I'll keep comin' back for more!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"The Best Bond Film Since ""Goldfinger""","The year 2012 marks the 50th Anniversary of ""Dr. No"", the movie that kicked off the James Bond film franchise. It was a relatively low-key spy thriller compared to what was to come. 40 years later, most fans would agree, the gadgets, stunts, and special effects of ""Die Another Day"" had become so over the top that it seemed like the series was starting to parody itself.""Casino Royale"" ditched the clichés and started from scratch, introducing Daniel Craig as a young James Bond just licensed to kill. The movie took a fresh, character-based approach to the series. This approach is continued in Daniel Craig's third and best take on the character, ""Skyfall."" Just as Sean Connery and Roger Moore (arguably) hit their strides with their third Bond movies (""Goldfinger"" and ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", respectively), Daniel Craig now seems to be settling comfortably into the role.While Daniel Craig still gives Bond the rough-around-the-edges qualities that distinguish his take on the role, he picks the right moments to channel the actors that have played the role before him. He's still able to show angst in the movie's dramatic moments, he also has that wry half-smile while taking out enemies and that satisfied smirk while seducing beautiful women that Sean Connery had, and he's finally comfortable enough to toss out a few one-liners worthy of Roger Moore. Though his delivery is so wonderfully dry that you almost don't realize they're puns.The movie starts with an opening sequences worthy of the tradition, an action-packed chase scene involving guns, Range Rovers, motorcycles, and speeding trains through Turkey. This climaxes in Bond's supposed death when his backup sniper accidentally hits him, knocking him off the tracks into the water below. After the main titles (one of the most bizarre credit sequences in Bond history, but also one of the most effective) it turns out Bond is taking advantage of being presumed dead to try and get out of the spy game. Until he learns someone is targeting the organization he worked for.Javier Bardem's villain, a flamboyant bleach blonde, is probably the most memorable since the classic days of Auric Goldfinger and Dr. No. He's introduced with one of the best evil monologues ever, and every scene he's in after that is totally chilling. Berenice Lem Marlohe and Naomie Harris are this movie's Bond girls, and while Marlohe's Severine is one of the most stunning Bond girls in ages and Harris' Eve is one of Bond's savviest sidekicks, their roles are both inconsequential compared to the true female lead. That would be Judi Dench as M. While the relationship between Bond and his superior has been explored more in Daniel Craig's Bond movies than ever before, here it's pushed front and center, forming the movie's emotional core, driving most of the plot, and making M a major player rather than just a character to provide exposition, showcasing Dench's talents as an actress.Sam Mendes manages to keep a personal, dramatic atmosphere through the entire movie, but still work in jaw-dropping action sequences. Unlike ""Quantum of Solace"", they're thankfully filmed in a steadier, more traditional manner. The movie's also very well paced: despite being one of the longest entries in the series, the action moves briskly and the story never drags. And Mendes and the rest of the ""Skyfall"" crew manage to avoid the clichés while still including Bond's trademarks. There's a new Q, in the form of the young Ben Whishaw. In a fresh new take on the character, when Bond seems disappointed by how practical the gadgets are, the young tech whiz responds, ""Expecting exploding pens? We don't really go in for that sort of thing anymore."" The gadgets bring to mind the earliest Bond movies, where it came as a surprise when Bond was able to use his equipment, unlike later movies, in which the situations that called for the gadgets were so specific you could make a checklist of them in Q's scene and then check them off as Bond used them. There are one or two other familiar characters that pop up as well, in ways that manage to feel both classic and fresh. And Ralph Fiennes brings charisma and gravitas to his role as M's new handler.""Skyfall"" is definitely a Bond movie for modern times. It's the first time a character (Judi Dench, no less) drops an ""F-bomb"" and the first time a bad guy actually makes a pass at 007.Like the 40th Anniversary, ""Skyfall"" is filled with references to what's come before. Unlike ""Die Another Day"", where the plot line seemed like a flimsy excuse to hang inside jokes on, in ""Skyfall"" the references are much more sly and subtle, and the story's actually sharp enough to support them, so long-time fans can smile while there's still plenty for newcomers to enjoy, even as the throwbacks go over their heads.There are a few missteps. After all, what Bond movie's been perfect since the Connery days? After some awesome action scenes, the climax seems to be taking a page from a totally different play book, and some of the characters' motivations and actions don't hold up to scrutiny. But overall, the mix of drama, action, and humor make ""Skyfall"" one of the best Bond movies of the entire series. It skillfully ushers in what's sure to be another new beginning for the series, and, back in fine form, I'm excited that ""James Bond will return.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Rightfully praised as one of the best Bonds yet,"'Skyfall' is certainly not flawless, but it is one of the best films of the year. The movie yanks the iconic character right into action, and he fights the murderer of an MI6 agent on top of a train. I really can't say much about the plot because there's suspense everywhere, and I'll feel as if I'm spoiling a part of it if I do say any more.The film, as expected, contains lots of action, as Bond jumps on the bottom of an elevator and dodges a falling train. In a good way, the setting jumps from set-piece to set-piece: the London Underground, a public inquiry, a casino, a childhood home named after the movie title - - so while there are some scenes that are a little slow and driven by mostly just talking, it's difficult to get bored.Some people have criticized the lack of chemistry between Daniel Craig and Naomie Harris, dismissing it as ""non-existent"". However, Eve is not a big character in the film; thus, it doesn't bring the whole movie down. 'Skyfall' doesn't have to be a romance.The third act also, to a few critics, didn't live up to what came before it, which I don't understand because the third act is practically non- stop action, and frankly the most entertaining part of the movie to me.Overall, 'Skyfall' is an awesome 50th anniversary present. It's stylish, it's action-packed, it has expansive set-pieces, Daniel Craig is a good Bond, and it's entertaining for a majority of its (somewhat long) running time. On a smaller note, the theme song is definitely an accomplishment for Adele. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
New 007 movie creates Intrigue for the future.,"Skyfall is a pure CLASSIC BOND movie. The First thing that came to my mind before watching the movie was ""What is Skyfall??"" But i was not disappointed as the question was answered in an intrigue style. There are lots of spoilers and mysteries. This is the first 007 movie to answer all the questions which we had been guessing all these years. This Movie requires a lot of patience and the casual movie goers, expecting lots of oomph and gadgets will be a bit disappointed.On the verge of completing 50 years for the Bond films, Sam Mendes has done a marvellous job which has to be visualized with your own eyes. Daniel Craig's best performance upto date as we see a lot more than action scenes or the cool, composed international spy with the deadly,cold stare. Judi Dench aka M has given the best performance when compared to other actors in the movie. She has shown us exactly what M is capable of during the crisis faced by MI6 and the decisions taken in a very cold brutal manner. Equally worth mentioning is the Main Antagonist, Javier Bardem aka Raoul Silva who shows us a Cold War style espionage which baffles our mind. Not to forget that Ralph Fiennes has a great responsibility which we could probably guess.The Film gives us a Fresh look into Bond's personal world, British Pride and a Stunning view of Scotland. Aston Martin DB5 - the sound of the engine revving made me wonder why don't we have such wonderful beasts?? The Bond Girls are a hit-miss affair.The movie is a reminiscence of spy vs spy with most of the actions in the ""SHADOWS"" with a mixture of haunting silence and pure 007 gun barrel sequences. Threat of a cyber war and Resurrection of Bond in a old genre style is a treat to watch. This movie gives a wonderful basement for future 007 ventures.If not for the slow pace at certain parts of the movie, I would have given it 10/10. I give 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Lame,"I confess that I am not a Bond fanatic, but in recent decades I saw them on TV and the life of a secret agent remains interesting phenomenon. That is why I was surprised at how much I look forward to the Skyfall; brilliant actors, a brilliant director, a a decent screenwriter. It's always Big Bang-type start, because they wanted to raise up the blood pressure of viewers and they use it thousands of scenarios. James Bond - survived the unimaginable. Never mind, I thought, it starts up and begins the film. Well, it would not start. We see the new center, a description of the mission, he came to the mission, but throughout I thought something was wrong. The film is slow, the scenes are long and one-sided. Here, let me tell you: I did not like the story, I did not like the way the film is sometimes slowed down. All together I did not like it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One Of The More Entertaining Bonds,"Wow, what a pleasant surprise.I think this is one of the best James Bond films ever made. I wasn't a fan of Daniel Craig's ""Bond"" before this.....but I am now. He was outstanding, as was the whole cast. So was the photography (Roger Deakins - one of the best cinematographers in the business) and the action scenes were extremely entertaining. Sure, some - like the opening - were over-the-top but that's what we've all come to expect and enjoy with the Bond movies. This opening scene ranks among the most astounding.Javier Bardem (""No Country For Old Men"") makes a fascinating villain, even though he doesn't appear for the first hour of the film.I've watched the movie three times in just over a year - which is unusual for me - and enjoyed it each time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Watch it now or you will surely repent not watching it in the theaters.,"Writing reviews is usually not my cup of tea, but this latest flick in the Bond series induced me to do it. Skyfall is one of best of the Bonds and personally my favorite. From the first second till the last breath, I was totally engrossed in the plot. The film captures your attention and makes you to watch it without even a blink of an eye. The plot of the movie is excellent. The exotic places in the movie, from Shanghai to Macau and then to Scotland, the director chose the best of the locations. Also the title song of the movie by Adele is amazing. The lyrics of the song totally defines the movie. Except of these things, you will find everything that a Bond movie requires. From the classic suites wore by Mr. Daniel Craig, the beautiful bond girls and the legendary Aston Martin, you will find everything in it.It is a must watch for the James Bond fans and if you are not a Bond fan, you will become one after watching this movie. I rate this movie a 10 as it fulfilled every requirement of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
There's nothing much to summarize but since IMDb insists Summary: it's a 'Must Watch'.,"I was going through the online reviews on the film and found an overwhelming majority in favor of this latest bond flick. As Daniel Craig is one of the most talented actors of the Bond franchise and of course a renowned entertainer world wide i was expecting something really goodSo did it match up to the hype??Well it's a BIG """"YES""""(with double-double quotes for super extra emphasis)The film is not at all like the so called 'conventional' Bond filmsIt really does place Bond right in middle of the technological advancements of the 21st century and not the sci-fi type achievements of the earlier Q-Branch(headed by Desmond Llewelyn) or some of the villains(which wasn't a bad thing either).Even though the idea might seem far fetched, considering Bond is the epitome of male coolness, the audience can relate itself to the character. And somehow we come to experience what Bond is experiencing mentally.This film is not for the narrow minded Bond audience who think only bond girls, cars, gadgets and the ending line,""Oh James!!"" make a classic bond film. This film is for those who accept change, for those who can very well do with out bond bedding a beautiful girl in the end and for those who can bear the sight of bond as a normal human being like others.Even if you are not into bond you will like it so do see it when it comes out in your country",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Satisfying; too many unanswered questions,"Skyfall, James Bond's 23rd screen adventure, caveats aside, is fun to watch both on a visceral level and on an intellectual level, but it leaves one with one too many unanswered questions or unexplained incidents to be counted among the best in the series. It's quickly paced, perhaps too quickly so, but the action scenes are memorable, as are the usual locales and women. Daniel Craig continues to solidify his hold on the iconic British spy.A hard drive containing the secret identities of all of MI6's secret agents has fallen into the wrong hands. You may ask why there would be one drive that contained all of that info, but that's neither here nor there for the purposes of this movie. Bond's mission is to track down the drive and exterminate the thief, but the thief has much bigger plans in mind - and they involve, of all people, M (Judi Dench). M's past has everything to do with this plot, and its central theme is one of trust.Now, let me get one plot point out of the way, because it's occurred in several preceding Bond films - James dies. Or maybe he doesn't, who knows. The man has come back from the dead about a dozen times, it seems. It's what happens afterward that may make you scratch your head, an entire sequence of scenes that don't seem to make a lot of sense, based on what we've come to learn about Bond over the past 50 years. The way Bond deals with certain events just doesn't seem in character.Bond has some help. On an initial mission gone bad, he is accompanied by Eve (Naomie Harris), who can drive and shoot and is otherwise a capable agent. Then there's a new, young Q (Ben Whishaw), who is naturally a computer whiz - a necessity in a movie in which the ages of both M and Bond are contrasted with the rapidly changing outside world. They're relics, you see.The bad guy here is played by a blond-bewigged Javier Bardem. He has control of the list, and he's releasing the identities of all agents, five at a time, for no apparent reason. Okay, there's a reason, it's apparent, but it's mundane. When it's explained to you, you might have trouble buying it as a logical explanation. You see, here's one thing we know about our double-O agents: they sign up for their missions knowing they could die and that their lives are not more important than the mission and certainly not more important than the country itself. So if there's an issue of trust in this movie, it's that I had trouble trusting the movie to be on the up-and-up. It's one of those times when a movie makes a rule for itself and then breaks it just to further a plot.That's not to say that the movie is not entertaining, because it really is. The action scenes are, as typical, well shot; there's car chases, train chases, fights, and even a chase on the London Tube. There are locales as diverse as Macau, Shanghai, London, and Scotland (the country, not the Yard). There are few bon mots and plenty of gunplay. In some sequences, it's as if we're watching an old Western. The cinematography is definitely up to par.I believe that while Craig's Bond takes a step forward in development, Dench's M takes a step backward. There's a difference between being stubbornly British and being unrealistically foolish, so I found M to be a little less believable than I had in previous films. Dench does her best in a role that's much more physical here than it had been in the past, too. Bardem makes a terrible villain, and I mean that in the good way. He's diabolical, insane, and yet creepily believable.Overall, the movie is like many other Bond films - likable, not too dark, not too deep, filled with action and gorgeous women and settings. It is by no means a bad film, or even a mediocre film. It's a good film. I was just baffled by some of the plot developments, and I felt there was too much time spent on extra, dispensable characters. It was also no surprise to me that, when a particular actor showed up, he would be very, very much involved in not only the end of the movie but also movies to come, and that's a shame (the knowledge, not the fact).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Best Bond film ever?,"Shockingly, because I don't actually think Daniel Craig is right for the role, yes. This is the best Bond film ever made.I should probably qualify that. I believe that Daniel Craig brings an intensity and a simple nastiness to the character of Bond that is absolutely spot on. He doesn't milk the one liners, though they are there in abundance. He doesn't play for laughs or camp it up. He makes it very plain that, basically, James Bond is a killer. A sophisticated and disciplined killer, but a killer nonetheless. And that's important. The trouble is that he's just too damn' conspicuous. If Daniel Craig walked into a room you'd notice and you'd remember. And that's no good at all - you want anonymity for that job.Back to the film. The plot is excellent, the script perfect and the acting generally very good indeed, as you might expect. Special effects are nicely done and strike a good balance. Not once did I sit back and scoff ""Well that's nonsense"" or something along those lines. Nor did I ever have certain knowledge of what was coming next. In fact there were more surprises than usual.I'll be going to see it again. Maybe more than once. Because it really was that good.

Judi Dench was fabulous as M, showing both steel & vulnerability and Daniel Craig gave a stellar performance as the flawed hero. There was plenty of eye candy for me and action for us both and I was impressed with the pace of the story and the quality of the dialogue.

Skyfall – The Resurrection!,"The Eon Productions $150 million, 23rd entry Skyfall, the much awaited 007 bond film is thrilling, gripping & entertaining.Adele's theme song ""This is the end-Hold your breath and count to ten- Feel the earth move and then-Hear my heart burst again"" sets it up with its catchy tone & the quite 1960s pace. The chase begins in the Istanbul's Grand Bazaar & is captivating indeed & well worth of a bond chase. The ""TAKE THE BLOODY SHOT"" is a one of its kind justifiable of the film's perfect tenacity!

The reflecting neon light shot where bond goes to chase the assassin in the darkness on top floor is worth a mention.

A Visually Stunning and Emotionally Charged Bond Film,"Skyfall, a standout entry in the James Bond series, earns a commendable 7/10 for its visually stunning cinematography and a deeper, more emotionally charged storyline. This film marks a significant point in the Bond franchise, blending traditional elements with a modern twist.The movie is visually breathtaking. The cinematography is exceptional, with each scene masterfully composed to enhance the film's dramatic impact. The use of color, lighting, and camera angles contributes significantly to the overall aesthetic, making Skyfall one of the most visually impressive Bond films.Skyfall also delves into the emotional depth of James Bond's character, a departure from the typical focus on action and espionage. This approach adds a new layer to the character, offering a glimpse into his vulnerabilities and past. The exploration of Bond's backstory provides a more rounded and human portrayal, which is both refreshing and intriguing.The storyline is well-constructed, combining high-stakes action with personal drama. The film maintains a balance between exciting action sequences and character development. However, some viewers might find this shift towards a more character-driven narrative less appealing, longing for the non-stop action traditionally associated with Bond films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The end of the typical bond movies and in to Oscar worthy bond movies.,"Skyfall is a film that signifies the end of the typical superman type bond movies.From all the 23 bond movies skyfall is a movie even a loyal classical bond movie fan would consider the best one.FOR me skyfall is the best not because of the cool action sequences or the cool cars but simple because of the story line.this is not a movie that bond simply get the girl and save the world from another weird disaster.This is a bond movie that even James bond breaks down under pressure.That even James bond have problems that a normal person have.In this movie the interpretation of James bond is more human. Sam Mendes is a master when it comes to creating masterpiece after watching skyfall it's obvious as to why Sam Mendes was selected to direct this movie.His interpretation of bond show the transcension of bond from past to present through out 50 years.After watching this movie it's obvious that this is not a stereotypical bond movie.With magnificent action sequences,drama and with a hint of comedy makes skyfall a well balanced movie.It's not a easy task to live up to 50 years of bond legacy but i think Sam Mendes has face the challenge magnificently.through his unique way of story telling i think he has honored the bond legacy. A main focus should be given to the acting of this movie.As usual Daniel Craig brings his gritty more emotional corrupted and brute force attitude to the bond character.Javier Bardem brings his Oscar winning performance to portray the bast bond villain in my book.overall skyfall is a amazing movie hopefully this unique interpretation of bond continues to future bond movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Without spoiling the film, it gives some hints of back-story for Bond before he joined MI6. The film was shock full of references to old bond films, and I believe that that is what made it great. However, I loved it because I loved those older films. It is a good movie on its own, but to really enjoy this movie you should have seen Bond films to truly appreciate all the references. The themes of the movie were very different then most other bond films, but the villain was one of the best in the recent films. This is a must see for any Bond lover, but if you haven't watched the other films first you miss out. I gave it a 9/10 for a Bond lover and 7.5-8/10 for someone who hasn't seen the previous films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Is MI6 that rookie?,"Bond films are action entertainers and as action entertainers go, you must allow some leverage in terms of suspension of disbelief. But this movie took it too farAs I went to watch this movie, it already had an 8.3 on IMDb with over 15,000 votes. The critics reviews are also highly positive (some calling it one of the greatest Bond movies). I had higher hopes also given Javier Bardem was the main antagonist. Like I said, I don't mind pure entertainment for an action movie, I quite enjoy the Fast and Furious series as pure action entertainers.My problem with this movie was it seemed like MI6 was being played for dumb throughout. There was one illogical scene and it was followed by another mind boggling where either MI6 would take a stupid call or the opponents would simply think them to be a bunch of useless amateurs and actually succeed with their plan. Now, the basic plot is completely fine and intriguing, it is the scenarios that were a complete let down. Sure, Bardem's character was intelligent, but it does not mean MI6 has to play dumb and let him get the best of the agency. Also, one generic point against most movies portraying cyber crime, you just show someone being a genius and don't even need to explain how one achieved his/her goals. But usually other such movies get canned by critics and viewers alike, strange everyone is looking the other way for this movie. Excessive romanticism with combination of Craig as Bond + Mendes is quite apparent, added no doubt by stellar performance by BardemFor a series that projects adventures of one of the greatest spies in the world working for an enviable intelligence agency, the movie should have been slightly more cerebral, have some deduction or logic to arrive at certain conclusions rather than simply a series of action sequences wherein it never seemed like the bad guys were able to get one up against the best, but go one up because there were giant loopholes just waiting to be exploited.Quite a disappointing movie with the only highlight being the title track and a few locales",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the best Bond films every,"I saw the original Bond films in theaters as a child, and loved them all. For me, Sean Connery is the ""real Bond,"" and this will always be true. My all-time favorite is From Russia With Love, followed by Goldfinger. I thought Roger Moore was a good choice, but I never liked him as Bond , in part because of the campy presentation of these films. I was very happy to see Daniel Craig as Bond, and I very much enjoyed Casino Royale. After seeing Quantam of Solace, I thought, ""Oh well. Time for a new Bond."" I was more than pleasantly surprised by his performance in Skyfall, as well as the continuation of Judy Dench as M. The acting, writing and direction were masterful. Ralph Fiennes was a terrific choice, and I was happy about the suggestion that we may see him again.Even if you don't like Bond movies, you really should miss this. Truly a masterpiece among action/thriller films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bardem saved Bond,"Skyfall is an uncommonly gloomy film with a dense and oppressing atmosphere almost macabre in the sense that the rickety claws of death are palpable throughout the entire plot. Symbols like skulls and tombs, an intro covered in blood, a devastated ghost town left for good, the rainy London swathed in dim shades of gray and blue, an old, abandoned mansion with hidden doors to dark, underground shafts; the cold Highlands of Scotland, a venomous scorpion and last but not least the villain's ugly, broken smile illustrate such an impression. And James Bond? After proving his own obituary wrong, Her Majesty's greatest agent returns from the dead to protect his agency from a powerful cyber terrorist named Silva and he is anything but fit for the job. The shimmering, mischievously smiling Bond as embodied by Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan is a thing of the past. The new Bond in ""Skyfall"" is less womanizer and more someone who has difficulties in hitting a target because of the injuries he suffered. He is suddenly vulnerable and his sense of humour was never dryer before, he really has to try hard to achieve his goals because he's getting old, the lightness of the previous Bonds is gone (for now). So it's not surprising that typical elements of the franchise like crazy action scenes as seen in ""Die Another Day"", odd gadgets like exploding cigarettes or completely freakish super villains living in a volcano crater are missing as well, even the occasionally sizzling erotic due to attractive Bond Girls (unfortunately) seems to lack space in the world of ""Skyfall"". The old trade marks exist only in nostalgic remembrance, as when Bond takes out an old Aston Martin DB5; the entire film appears to be a farewell to good old times when the Vodka martini was still shaken and not stirred. What's left is an exiting story of revenge, told in a straightforward, pure and slow-paced fashion and carried by the tragic figure of Silva who the great Javier Bardem plays with such impressing intensity and morbid elegance that it's a real joy seeing him on the big screen. Silva, who is more dead than alive, seeks nothing but revenge, he is smart and coldblooded; in appearance somewhere between ""The Joker"" and ""Jack Sparrow"", and, most of all, he has a history explaining his motivations, adding depth to his character which makes him a perfect antagonist to Bond. Closely connected to Silva's past is M (Judie Dench), Bond's boss, who, for the first time, had a major role in this film. She is a strong, principled women willing to make hard decisions that could cost people's lives; a good counterbalance to the often decorative Bond Girls who don't have much to say of real importance. M, 007 and Silva are the three main figures in a Shakespeare-like tragedy around which a plot revolves being too thin and unoriginal to be really noteworthy, a rather cheep frame of what's supposed to be an otherwise well drawn picture. However, the frame may not be so important after all. It's the dark atmosphere and a nuanced character drawing together with an amazingly thrilling villain that make ""Skyfall"" stand out from the previous films. James Bond, as we knew him, is dead...only to live on.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"No, the is NOT the best Bond film ever....However...","No, this is NOT the ""best Bond movie ever."" However, yes...it is a great action film.For his third installment, Daniel Craig returns to perfect form (in more ways than one) in the twenty-third film that brings certain elements back to Bond basics. Kick-starting with the as-expected excellent opening action sequence which sets up the tone of the rest of the film, don't go expecting a ""fun"" Bond, as this installment, although littered with humour and self-referential moments, is relatively dark and serious...and not necessarily as heroically-motivated as it is a story motivated by more of a personal crusade.Without giving anything away, this time around, Bond is not saving the world, necessarily, he's not really even saving a city. After MI6 is targeted by a terrorist, a resurrected Bond returns to go after the man responsible as it seems that, ultimately, what seems to be targeted is M herself. And thus, not the lightest of action films. But a seriously great ride, just the same.That being said, Craig is still second-to-none as a Bond with wit, looks, stealth and vengeance in his eyes. The most human of all Bonds, even when he is not up to par on certain levels, there is no question the man is still made of a different cloth than you or me, and thus, even when pulling a stunt wounded, you do not question his ultimate ability to do so.As the film's villain, Oscar-winning Javier Bardem, and a horrible blond wig, step up to the challenge. As the sexually ambiguous Silva, Bardem shows that he is certainly a go-to guy for such a position while not utilizing his brilliance as an actor to necessarily rise to occasion so much that Silva will ever be remembered as one of the greatest, most threatening or most dangerous villains Bond has encountered...contrary to what other people are mistakenly saying. Bardem is both exciting in some regards and slightly disappointing in others, but overall, remains entertaining to watch.Dame Judi Dench is superb, as always, as M...in trouble. But the introduction of Ralph Fiennes as a potential new adversary for those within the shaky walls of MI6 offers a hint of new blood being injected into the series along with the the One-Direction reject that plays Q, Ben Wishaw. Bond girls Naomie Harris and Bérénice Marlohe are both excellent.So, while Daniel Craig proves for the third time that he is the greatest actor to ever step foot in the role of bond, no....""Skyfall"" is not the best Bond film ever and Adele's title track is definitely one of the worst. However, it does include one of the best, most surprising lines in the history of the series in ""What makes you think it's my first time?""

Fantastic,"Believe it or not, the only other James Bond film I have ever seen is Casino Royale. Yes people, feel bad for me if you must. But what's obvious about this series is that one doesn't have to be familiar with most of them, or even perhaps any at all. I saw Royale around 5 years ago and haven't since, but was still to fully enjoy Skyfall. Who knew Sam Mendes could direct a franchise action film like this, but he does so masterfully. On a technical level it's pretty brilliant, with a wonderful score from Newman and unsurprisingly fantastic and crisp cinematography from the God Roger Deakins. Bardem is the stand-out here. He clearly has a lot of fun with the role and it shows, and in a very strong year for Supporting Actor contenders, he might even be in the Top 5 for me.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The sky didn't fall though,"Can I just see every film ever made, but shot by Roger Deakins okay please and thank you.I mean, I wouldn't say that either Casino Royale or Quantum Of Solace looked bad (if you can ignore the action scenes in the latter), but this one...oh my god every scene is a visual feast, the lighting is stunning, and the colours are soooooo pretty *heart eyes*Roger Deakins, you got that Oscar far too late.It's so beautiful that at several points I found myself forgetting that I would still appreciate the direction being a bit more creative, which is unfortunately still a pretty key flaw in this series for me.But oh my godddddd is it gorgeous while unfortunately being a little bland in concept. Not that there's nothing to it, though, in some ways I would say this is a little better than Casino Royale. I just can't help but notice a few little issues with the story here, like the main villain's plan being pretty insane to put into place, some other little plot holes aside from his plan, the scene with the Bond girl of the week being...really creepy to me...not sure if anyone else felt that way or not, but there you go...And the biggest problem with the story if you ask me, is that there's quite a lot of the characters prattling on about whether or not Bond, and the organisation he represents, is still relevant in the modern world, and by the end of the film, it feels like that hasn't gone anywhere or changed anything in-universe. But that said, the narrative is still enjoyable, just not as interesting as Casino Royale. This is a more straightforward and old-school Bond affair.But I'll take that any day of the week over a Bond film trying to be a Bourne film instead, especially if it means that you can actually tell what the hell is going on whenever there's a fight scene. Which, thankfully, you can.The new additions to the cast are great, while the old ones are just as fantastic as they were in the last two films, the characters they play are a lot of fun to watch, and the soundtrack stood out quite a lot to me compared to the other two films.I just don't think it's as good as Casino Royale, and I hope that no one wants to tie me to a chair and whip my balls repeatedly for saying so.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
No energy left.,"OK, so this is going to turn into a rant so be prepared. After a 40 year, legendary, storied franchise, that gave us plenty of action, fancy gadgets, shakin' not stirred, babes, cool effects, amazing stunts and a simple idea, that the good guy always wins in the end, we enter into this modern era of, we need to humanize things, make them more believable, add in human frailties, make it darker and cut back on the old stuff. I say, ""no"". Bond didn't become Bond, because we thought that 50 years later we would have to turn it into Bond meets Steel Magnolias, Bond is Bond, because of a formula that was created back in 1962 that held up just fine, even into the Pierce Brosnan years (we can pretend those last two films never happened). For some reason in the 21st Century Joe Movie-Goer has managed to con Hollywood into believing that what made these franchises great is old now and we need to take the Father Knows Best/Godfather approach to modern movies. You see it with everything. If you ask me the modern modifications to these franchises make them look even sillier than the old ones ever could be.In the case of Skyfall (2012), this issue is all over this film like prickly heat. We are handed an interesting story relating to the idea that Bond (Daniel Craig - who finally grew on me in Quantum of Solace), is getting old. It's quite evident, as explained by bad-guy Silva (Javier Bardem), that Bond has been in the business for 25 years now (roughly). We are also treated to a backstory explaining Bond losing his parents and growing up in an orphanage until he is ""drafted"" into MI6. This is where all this silly talk about comparing James Bond to Bruce Wayne comes in. Anyway, that aspect of the story is interesting and new, which I have no problem with, but the drag that the plot bestows on the film just makes it a boring affair, with not enough Bond-ism going on. I literally leaned over to my friend and said, ""I need some action, they are losing me with this script"". After being severely disappointed by Casino Royale (2006 - Phil's Grade: D+), but thrilled by what they did in Quantum of Solace (2008 - Phil's Grade: A-) I was hoping they would, at least try to combine the stuff that people liked in Casino Royale with the adrenaline rush-high energy effect that Quantum of Solace had, but I saw too much of Casino Royale in this one.But, to summarize; what we end up having here for Skyfall (2012) is a film that delves into a character that never had much fleshing out ever (I'm sure the novels covered this stuff, but the movies never did and quite frankly I don't care), with minimal fun and action sprinkled in. They did do an interesting paradoxical view on a lot of the secondary Bond characters that is a treat by film's end, but the rewards are few and far between in a taxing script that even wore me down, I'm being nice here with my grade because the three action scenes they did were pretty awesome and there were a handful of nostalgic nods to Bond film history, especially the car and Javier Bardem and Judi Dench are fantastic.7.1 (C MyGrade) = 7 IMDB",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
I have reluctantly become a Bond fan,"I have never been a great fan of James Bond, our favourite movie psychopath for 50 years now. The one and only Bond movie that drew me to the theatre was Diamonds are forever, in 1971. I went not so much for Connery's Bond with his smug attitude, but his Bond girl, Jill St-John, who was my secret love at the time and even more so, when I found myself sitting in front of her on the Expo-Express at Expo 67, in Montréal. For sure over the years I saw bits and pieces of Bond movies on late night television, but that is pretty much the extent of my experience. So why did I go to the cinema this time? Well, because of Daniel Craig this actor who continues to impress, notably in the Millennium remake. Add to that, the almost unanimous reviews stating that it is a good Bond movie, maybe the best to date. So, it did not appear to me that I was going to sit through a bomb. Is it as good as they say? Affirmative. It's 2 and half hours of continuous action, of intelligent dialogue and nice kudos to the past 50 years of the series. The return of the classic DB5 is a good example. The Bond franchise was getting long in the tooth for at least a decade, if not more. Skyfall marks a sharp departure with the past and bodes well for the future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Absurd on many levels but entertaining.,"This Bond film gets high praise, mainly due to its entertainment value. I mean, you get:Exotic locations and a good looking Bond girl.Twist and turns.Hard hitting action scenes, one more spectacular than the other, with Michael Bay level explosions.But if you actually look at the plot and how it unfolds, you can't help but see how dimwitted it is and won't help but chuckle quietly. Very little of it makes sense, how evidence is deduced doesn't, and very little of what Bond or the main villain or character do is realistic or believable (down to the villain redirecting a subway to be used as a cannonball to hit Bond...).But it's entertaining and it works. It just shouldn't be getting above 7 stars, and shouldn't be so overvalued by fans.But it is definitely superior to the lackluster ""Spectre"" and the abysmal ""Quantum of Solace"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A real classic Bond film,"I say ""classic"" in two senses. First, because I believe all future Bond movies will be compared to this one; second, because this is the first Bond movie (to my knowledge) that doesn't rely on gimmicky sci-fi plot twists, or completely unbelievable gadgets or technological breakthroughs that allow the villain to control the world.I also say ""real"" because nearly everything about this movie is very realistic and plausible. You don't ever feel like you are in a make-believe world. There are a few points at which the viewer's credulity is tested (mainly the computers), but for most of the movie, things look and feel completely plausible.Skyfall has essentially redefined the genre while remaining true to the essential character of the brand. We still have the suave, polished Mr. Bond, but he's now aging, not quite as sure of himself (and thus very real). The villain, perhaps the creepiest ever, is simply a twisted wreck of a human, but still clearly human. All the stock features are there, including a phenomenal opening credits in the standard psychedelic mood but very creatively handled, and with a great song by a top current singer (Adele).Casting is excellent, and Daniel Craig has already established himself as the best Bond of all time. Bardem in the villain's role is phenomenal, Dench is the best M ever, and while the youthful Q is a bit sophomoric, he does add a nice contrast to the now middle-aged Bond. The introduction of Ralph Fiennes is very good, he fits his role and the entire Bond milieu perfectly.The plot is straightforward, the tension palpable, and the conclusion has some surprises. Bond is seen to be human and vulnerable, yet still an incredible killing machine. Absolute must see for anyone who has even the slightest interest in the Bond franchise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best of the Craig Bond Films,"Daniel Craig is without question in this reviewers opinion a great actor. The roles he has played as James Bond are not his greatest work and the reason can be the the stories and the Bond character are not demanding enough to pull the best out of Craig. Bond has had a formula that must be followed or he fails at being bond. His vodka martinis, his trysts with and treatment of ""girls"" or beautiful women requires little talent. In fact requires little less than to look, walk and talk in a suave and sexy way. But that's our James Bond so those who play Bond are judged not by their overall acting ability but by the way they play the role to our satisfaction. So we develop the fan clubs for Connery and Moore and even Brosnan for those that managed to play the role for at least three times.Craig, in Skyfall does his most credible job as Bond and show his overall acting ability to a greater degree, making this film one where Bond is a bit deeper than most others. I can say that the Craig section of the Bond films did release us from the obligatory monster sets and monster king pin ""Dr Evil"" kind of villains. No kitty cats to pet and no sharks to feed and that is a relief because then the story has to rely on other things to entertain the audience.Skyfall does take the audience to other spots in the world but the focus of the story is London and Great Britain. Is this good? Perhaps but London herself is no a very sexy city to use as a backdrop or even as a main stage. In spite of many great individual buildings with interesting architecture, it does not have that overall sense of intrigue or sexiness. Perhaps it is simply not different enough for most of us. But the story is an English story this time and the villain targets London for his nastiness.The villain is the number one best villain as far as character is concerned. Javier Bardem, the super evil killer tank that could not be stopped in No Country for Old Men, the one that had ice cold freon running in his veins has has been out done by Bardem in the role of Silva. So totally ruthless without a drip of conscience for the evil he plans and carries out you are amazed at how much of a connection you make with him. Just as the quote from Goldfinger has become almost universally known James Bond asks ""Do you expect me to talk"" Goldfinger replies ""No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die."" The quote from Skyfall will be Bond:""(dodging an explosion) Was that for me?"" and Silva's reply with a laugh is: ""No, but that is"". If you've seen the film you know what the scene is. If not, you'll still be just as surprised.Special Effects are not the star in this film as much as the often have been but the stunts still reign supreme. Bond can still do things and survive things that would kill the ordinary man in fit condition. But that is why we like him. He is virtually indestructible. In Skyfall however, his mortality is shown more than any other Bond film to date. This seems to make him even more of a hero. He suffers and yet does not fall, well that's not exactly accurate.All said, Bond is more human, more sensitive and less a chauvinistic brute wrapped in suave dressing. He is more one of us and for that all the more amazing what he accomplishes without super powers, super gimmicks and super effects. It is a pleasant relief that after 50 years in the field, Bond can still carry the flag.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Definitely in my top 5 Bond films for sure.,"I just saw Skyfall yesterday afternoon. Two hours and twenty-three minutes later I came out of the theatre in a very enjoyable mood and was nearly giddy, but reserved. It was the first time in several years that I've seen a good Bond movie (obviously I'm referring to Casino Royale as opposed to its sequel Quantum of Solace, the latter of which was below-average in my mind). It's not often that a Bond film starts off immediately with a lightning fast action sequence that has more than its fair share of tense moments culminating in a sudden, shocking climax before the intro (speaking of which, the intro sequence was good, but it could've been done a little better), but Skyfall does it so well. The last thing I'll say about this without spoiling anything is that it just shows viewers that sometimes 007's ""superhuman"" abilities fail him or don't materialize as originally intended.Now onto the acting. Craig, as demonstrated in his first two films (more CR than QoS though) is a hard-nosed Bond who portrays the spy as one who still has something to prove and can still play a large role in being a spy. Craig acted very well in this movie, arguably his most significant experience surpassing what he did the first time he played the role. Javier Bardem played one of the best villainous roles in any Bond movie and was an equal to, if not superior than Craig was. The fact that his character's prime motive was a fresh one as opposed to the classic ""taking over the world"" mantra gave credence to his portrayal of a shrewd, confident and evenly-tempered psychopath (yes that's a bit of an oxymoron). Not very many love scenes in this movie and the Bond girls aren't seen very much, but perhaps that's because the ""real"" Bond girl is M. Judi Dench plays one of the largest roles of her character in the history of Bond films (if not the largest), and the film explores the intricate relationship between 007 and herself. She even gets in on the action a bit, as has previously happened in The World is Not Enough. Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney also had notable roles in the movie.Lastly, I did mention that this would be in my top 5 Bond films. I'd place it at #2 on my list, as my favourite after yesterday is still Goldfinger. The last thing I'll mention in this review is that Goldfinger fans would be delighted with some key moments in this movie.9/10 - A job very well-done.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
7/10 An Exciting Glimpse Of Mendes Brilliance,"Skyfall has a second movement that is so fantastic, with gritty realism and exceptional cinematography elevating an emotive and clear narrative into such highs that I think we all sat upright and realised what was, clearly, possible. Unfortunately a lot of us got so excited we forgot about the first half, which was not as good, and we talked it up like the whole thing is a masterpiece...it's clearly not! Our introduction to Javier Bardem's character is particularly excellent, but problematic moments constantly frustrate the first half and it seems evident that a lot of production tinkering is at play, all-the-more frustrating with a director like Sam Mendes at the helm but apparently denied full creative control (an issue that later emerged as a red line for director and co-writer Danny Boyle during NTtD preproduction). At one point in this film it feels like there is active creative directorial rebellion afoot, with a no-doubt contractual reference to 'VW Beetles' suitably questioned, before the cars themselves are ceremoniously crushed, an extended shot of an expensive watch on the wrist of the hand on the throttle leaving us in no doubt that this is all an annoyance, though still apparently necessary for financial reasons? As for Q and his 'obfuscated code' well you definitely need plenty of cups of Earl Grey to make that plausible. Heineken maybe. Why are the writers resorting to such ridiculous technical gimmickry? At least we were spared the glaring Ford car advert this time. And the tone has improved significantly. And Sam is in the chair for the next film.

Simply Brilliant,"The classic villain versus Bond that we missed is back, and better than before.Daniel Craig once again shows that he managed to fill very large boots by grabbing the rains of the role and making it his. As James Bond he is seen to have to make some life threatening decisions in order to get ahead of what seems as an unbeatable villain, Raoul Silva.The villain, Raoul Silva, is exactly what a bond movie needed; feared, interesting strength in technology, one step ahead of MI6 and a memorable defect as well as a perfect background. Played by Javier Bardem, one could only think he was simply ideal for the role.Judi Dench is seen in the movie as having another great role, possibly a more interesting one to any other of the Bonds she has starred in (watch it to find out what I am talking about) and does not fail to let her experience in acting skills shine.Sam Mendes I take my hat off to you for putting the Bond film back on track to making many more, in which I hope you will have an influence upon as possible director for the future films. You brought the Villain vs Bond plot back after being lost, following on from that you made a ideal villain that Bond had not faced and managed to show Bond's true skills as an agent. You even managed to bring some missed characters back in and you did it without possible prediction till the last moment.Congratulations and a job well done.I gave the movie a solid 9 out of 10, the reasons for it not being ten out of ten is simply because I do not believe in perfectibility, but I am truthful when I say it is certainly not far from this.If you have not seen this film yet, you MUST.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
No chance of the sky falling in on this franchise JUST yet...,"""Skyfall"" proves there is life in the James Bond franchise yet. Indeed, shouldn't these films have died a death already? It is remarkable they are still going, in the wake of the culmination of the Cold War; the initiation of the War on Terror; Britain's own changing place on the world stage as a super-power and the ever-changing tastes that cinema-goers have. Just where does Bond, as both a filmic entity and a character within his own universe, fit in to all of this?The spy thriller demands, when all is said and done, a narrative, but Bond is big-business and very much part of mainstream film culture, which of course isn't interested in narrative. When Daniel Craig sits, pensively, in a gallery staring at a painting of an old warship being tugged away, it doesn't require much thought to work out the allusion. The scene is somewhat spoiled by another character verbally confirming it to us, but there you go. Later on, a scene involving Judi Dench being asked by an obnoxious MP as to what the ""point"" of her division is anymore should strike us as probably the series' most existential ever moment.Beginning in Turkey, the film opens with an impressive sequence involving the infiltration of a building; a foot-chase through the dusty streets, which evolves into a car chase, before settling for a battle aboard a freight train as Bond (Craig) and Naomie Harris' Moneypenny strive to reclaim a stolen list of identities of undercover NATO agents. What is striking about this opening, aside from the somewhat awkward moment whereby Bond must 'take-over' driving duties from his female accomplice in order to properly land a fatal blow, is its pessimism - the heroes do not obtain the list; there is no win or quip after all the stunts, just a failure.This is due to Moneypenny accidentally shooting Bond with a sniper rifle (can she do nothing right?) - he falls from the train and a bridge into a river; director Sam Mendes cleverly transposes the sound effects of the running water whilst focusing on a distraught looking Dench in a wet London as rain teems down the window she looks out of. The first words of the title song we hear thereafter are ""this is the end..."" We sense then that there is something afoot, and everything thereafter carries with it a strange sense of vulnerability.Bond is not dead, of course, but utilises his time in the wake of his injury to bed women and engage in nefarious drinking games on a Caribbean island while, back home, M (Dench) is told she's being phased out of her role as head of the division. Intelligence is then hit by a cyber-attack. It is to the film's credit that is sets aside time for Bond's rehabilitation back into being an agent of some stature again instead of making the mistake of merely allowing him to be able to pick up where he left off before an alcohol-fuelled sabbatical.What is most impressive about ""Skyfall"" is its ability to be able to look back as well as ahead AND be able to systematically tell a decent story of espionage - Mendes has managed to make a Bond film with an opinion on its own status: it has time for the silver Aston Martin, but doesn't think much of the exploding pen gadget. The film is otherwise peppered with the imagery of our time: an exploding London underground train; characters utilising YouTube and has one eye on the dominant role computer run neural networks have in our world. The idea of 'hackers' as villains might have ended up as stale and silly, but the film pulls it off and it even comes across as quite original.A mention must go to Javier Bardem for playing the lead villain in the form of Raoul Silva, whose entrance is put to a long unbroken shot of the man entering a large warehouse on a long-since abandoned island that is therefore stuck in time and so clashes with all the tech-savvy equipment around him. As he talks about controlling the world via the Internet, his terminals begin to look like rolls of razor wire stacked up together thus inferring a sense of the impenetrable. If we are surprised that there are degrees of duality between Bond and Silva after a later reveal, we perhaps should not be - Mendes' had already introduced the pair of them at their respective moments in the same manner: with a long, slow pacing towards the camera.Certainly, after the nature of ""Quantum of Solace"", which I did not think terrible but appeared plastic and hurried in the wake of ""Casino Royale"", ""Skyfall"" brings narrative clarity; genuine excitement and, most importantly, heart back to the series which may exist now in a very different world to the one it was born into, but is nevertheless still able to pack a punch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond for the die hard fans,"Just seen Skyfall and have to say that it is a great film. I've been a Bond fan for as long as I can remember and have enjoyed each film in the series. Craig is a great Bond and has really bought Bond up to date. The story for Skyfall shows Bond as you have never seen him before. It brings out the inner workings of what makes Bond tick and why he has the attitude that gets him into trouble.The other great thing about Skyfall is that it has bought back the old characters and again updated them. The producers have done themselves and the Bond legacy proud. Without giving to much away its a great film for the die hard Bond fan. Its has all the things you would expect in a Bond film and a lot that you wouldn't .

"Maybe the Best 007 Film Since ""From Russia with Love""","Seven actors have portrayed James Bond, Agent 007 of MI-6, the ultra- secret bureau branch of British Intelligent. None, in my humble opinion, will ever outdo Sean Connery as the cool and calculating international spy who sports automatic hand-guns and beautiful mistresses. However, I believe a close second may be the latest installments featuring Daniel Craig. While the forgettable mid-Bond films, starring Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan, who seemed like he was just replaying Remington-Steele with higher budgets, more often than not were more like Bond-by-the-numbers intent on making money from the name, the women, and the gadgets, Daniel Craig has stood out. Craig may well be the best successor to Connery in the role.The other Bond installments with the above-list of mediocre actors in cookie-cutter installments, featuring the obligatory femme-fatale, a casino scene, and a chase through the Alps, pale in comparison to the latest Bond installments with Craig. Maybe why I like the Craig versions as some of the best since Connery has to do with making Bond more vulnerable. In many of the Moore and Brosnan installments, I certainly knew Bond would break free from his plot-driven shackles but the way the character was played, I thought the character himself knew he would win in the end, and so I was never rooting for him. He was always so cool that I knew he knew he would prevail. Not with Craig. Craig's take on Bond is more subtle with sudden unexpected emotions, as if his character doesn't know whether it will turn out in his favor, which is as it should be. Craig sweats, grunts, even sheds tears. I never saw Moore grunt hardly at all. (I liked ""Jaws"" from ""Moonraker"" much more than Moore.)In ""Skyfall"", Bond and MI-6 are dealing with a foe who has infiltrated the computer systems of British Intelligence. Part of this foe's breach includes the revealing the aliases of under-cover British agents all over the world. Bond and MI-6 must stop this baddie before he or she compromises more field agents which may lead to their deaths. Is this is an old foe, like Specter, a new foe, or someone else? Maybe someone who knows the intricacies of British Intelligence? A wonderful film from start to finish with a good combination of humour, action and even emotion. And there's even a throw-back to elements of the old Bond films of the 1960's.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Skyfall,"Ok, first things first. ""Skyfall"" and ""crumble"" do not rhyme. Sorry Adele, but they don't! Luckily, the rest of this story is almost as good as ""Casino Royale"" (2006). Daniel Craig reprises his role as ""007"", this time charged with thwarting a dastardly plan by the enigmatic ""Silva"" to avenge himself on none other than ""M"" (Dame Judi Dench) herself. He has managed to successfully infiltrate just about every system MI6 has and obtain a list of agents the world over. When he starts publishing these names, and the body count starts to rise, it falls to ""Bond"" to engage with his clever and malevolent foe. Bardem is effective as the baddie here. He has a certain, almost menacing, effeteness as he quite literally toys with his quarry. Loads of gadgets, explosions, a welcome appearance from the original Aston Martin and an action-packed pace keep this moving along well. The ending is a bit far-fetched, even by ""James Bond"" standards, and that even though it did give us chance to enjoy a suitably eclectic contribution from Albert Finney, was all just bit daft. The supporting efforts don't bode so well, either. Ralph Fiennes seems set for a larger role in future films and he doesn't really add much and though she does well enough, the role offered to Naomie Harris' ""Eve"" is just too insubstantial for her to assert herself on much of the story. That said, though, it's very much at the top end of the Craig outings for this character and it does look good on big screen,",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Brilliant Bond,"Skyfall feels like the rebirth of Bond. Not just because of how poorly received Quantum of Solace was (it was poor), but we're also reintroduced to some new/old characters such as Q and Moneypenny as well as the ushering in of a new M. It truly feels like a new chapter for Bond.Our villain this time around is Silva, a former agent played by Javier Bardem who feels like he was betrayed by M (Judi Dench) and is hellbent on getting his revenge on her. It's a very personal motive for this films villain as we're used to someone simply wanting to rule the world, Silva just wants M.It's a good story and threaded together with some fantastic action sequences - the opening scene alone if breathtaking and by far the best a Bond film has seen to this point. After the awful over editing camera work of QoS that made action scenes hard to follow with a hint of motion sickness, I didn't have any problem with any of it this time around.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Skyfall the best of three so far!,"Skyfall, no doubt the best movie of the James Bond 007 series.

a changing Bond - interesting and self reflexive,"A lot of people have been disappointed by the change of tone in the last few Bond films. They say, it is too far away from the original, classic tone of the Bond series. 007 is not the old fashioned agent anymore, who cares more about women and about the way the barkeeper fixes his Martini, than about his job. He has become a cold killer, an almost robot-like fighter. Physical limits don't seem to apply to him. The plot of Skyfall is pompous and - if you want to be fussy - pretty unrealistic. I tend to agree with all this. But then, this Bond film is much more than just an espionage thriller. It is a complex and self- reflexive movie. More of a a cinematic statement than just another action thriller.The universe of Skyfall is a universe where the borders between good and bad are not always clear. It is a universe where the ""old"" Bond has to die and a ""new"" Bond has to undergo a process of self-discovery. It is a universe where even the MI 6 cannot do as it pleases anymore. It is a world where good cannot always win and where the happy ending is not necessarily happy. I is a world that changes, a world turned upside down. The action sequences are beautiful, the allusions to older Bond films are fun, Javier Bardem is probably the best Bond villain ever and the final showdown is the quintessence of all Bond movie showdowns.So, yes. If you expect a classic Bond you will be completely disappointed. But if you want to go on an interesting and critical ride through Bond history you should not miss this movie. And maybe you will understand why Bond has to change.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The music and the much beloved DB5,"A quick note for the car lovers. Please note the car is spelt Aston Martin and not Astin or Austin-thank you.The times and Bond may have moved on, but this was a really weak film. No wit, no humour, no charm, no fun and the action scenes don't conjure up much suspense or excitement. Why did spending $200 million the end result came out so lame andfairly boring. If there was a sanistised and political corrected film , this was it.Two questions: 
1) Was it intentional to have such a p8ss poor orchestral score with no sense of anticipation,depth,suspense or meaning? Part of watching any Bond film IS to have these dramatic musical injections into a scene.2) Was blowing up the DB5 really neccessary or was it to sybolically and finally kill off any connections with the 'old' style Bond. Regardless of how the films have developed over the years that iconic car should have remained. Ever since being a boy and watching Goldfinger at the Cinema that DB5 stood out as THE Bond car. They have all but killed off any future Bond film that comes out thereafter. Enough said.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Not your typical Bond flick,"Saw it last night at the Hollywood Cinerama dome. Long, dark, very Chris Nolan-esque. Not your typical 007 flick with adventure, intrigue, Bond girls and gadgets.

I think this is the first film where I found myself glad I ""wasn't"" him.I personally didn't care for Javier Bardem as the villain.

"missing the tongue in cheek humour, silly gadgets and kitch cheesiness","This was a great 50 year Anniversary Bond film. I'm a fan of Daniel Craig as Bond; he's cold, detached and looks rather beat up most of the time (not pristine) just like the Bond in the books. Him and Judi Dench are great together, with Dame Judi as the irrepressible M. This film sees a new Q who's quite a nice addition but he didn't have the gadgets and gizmos - the silliness - we come to expect from previous Qs. The stunts in this are awesome; the stunt bikers need a whole heap of awards and the scene on the train roof was brilliant and some of the fight scenes were worthy of a Bourne movie, however, something is missing from the modern Bonds that I miss and I think it's the tongue in cheek humour. Craig's Bond is probably nearer to the books and a real-life Spook/Ghoul but the kitch cheesy one-liners and the over the top innuendo of Bond's conquests is lost. Yes, the films are slicker, faster, darker and smoother but I can't give the film the high marks that it perhaps deserves. I also find all the product placement really annoying; Bond has always been a big business and a franchise but I think it's gone too far.Javier Bardem was the star of this show, he was really creepy, mad and unrecognizable in the guise of crazy-freaky blonde bad-guy! Berenice Marlohe was stunning. Scotland views were beautiful and we learn a little about Bond's back-story and I love that Craig as Bond is broken and more than a little messed up rather than pristine like Roger Moore! The story was sadly lacking, not much suspense (courtesy of in depth trailers) and whilst I don't usually notice them I saw a lot of continuity errors and silly mistakes. Annoying.For a Bond film, it's great, fabulous entertainment and I'd recommend it. As a film generally, I'm giving it 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Roger Moore is still the best Bond,"It was worth the ticket price but it didn't surpass my expectations.There were a few clever lines by Bond and the motorcycle chase scene was very good. That's what I remember most about the film. The acting was fine, the cinematography and direction excellent, yet at the end of the film I still wasn't wowed. Why? It wasn't so much that the plot was bad, but rather too many of the scenes left me wondering, ""Huh, how did he do that?"", especially in reference to the bad guy.As a side note, I understand that the Bond franchise is all about moving forward and I'm not saying that Daniel Craig or any of the new faces aren't good, but IMO Roger Moore brought out the best of what Bond is all about in a very particular British way. He didn't need to be buff, he was just more clever, with humor.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A must see for any Bond Fan old-timer,"Having been an avid Bond fan my entire life, I had been eager to see this new release. I was very impressed indeed. I had been disappointed by Quantum of Solace but this film is far superior to that. Packed full of action that, I have to admit did feel a little cliché at times but very enjoyable nonetheless. There were quite a few scenes in London which made it feel very British and classic Bond - in fact there were a number of classic Bond references which made me smile, so watch out for that :) A twisting storyline kept be guessing what was coming but the best aspect of this film was the development of the characters - I feel like this film shows Bond and M in different lights which was very refreshing. Quite a few funny lines, classic Bond charm and wit. Overall I really enjoyed it a great deal, recommended highly to all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Exceptional Execution And A Step In A New Direction,"Let me just get this out of the way and say that I am not the most immersed fan of the Bond films, and I only properly watched Craig's interpretation of Bond. Though I am aware about the principles of the Bond films like girls, gadgets, etc. Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace felt like they were trying to steer away from the principles that fueled the pre-Craig bond films. Skyfall in the other hand embraces it and spraying something new in there making it feeling fresh and unique.The film was written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade & John Logan. Since both Purvis and Wade have experience and knowledge of the history of Bond, they may be responsible for the genius reference moments in the film, like Q and the Aston Martin DB5. Logan on the other hand was a surprise for me as he has never written a Bond film before and isn't a frequent collaborator with Mendes. Nevertheless Logan has done well here. He has brought that imagination of thrilling and intense action sequences here that haves us hooked all the way through. The film is able to explore the argument of the traditional and contemporary approach, even more so at the end of the film, which I thought was a nice touch. The emotional drive in the film is carried not by Bond but rather by M, as the film showcases the regrets and sacrifice that M has made and the torment and suffering that others and herself it has caused. The film also surprised me by touching on Bond's past, showing us his roots and home.When I heard Sam Mendes was directing this film, I knew that this was going to be handled much better and the film will feel significant and requires to be viewed over and over again. I was a bit worried on how he would handle the action element of the film as I don't really see him as the most onerous when it comes to those particular moments but he really outdid himself here with action sequences that shine and is memorable. It is the intimate moments where I appreciate Mendes' craft because he has proved it with his previous films like Away We Go and American Beauty. Mendes really understood Skyfall's characters, displaying their vulnerabilities and strengths allowing us to engross on the story and the relationships that is being explored. Mendes has accomplished in creating the most stylish Bond film yet, at least for now. The film is definitely a first step into a new phase of Bond that will define the subsequent Bond films.Roger Deakins has worked with the best directors of this century and he frequently collaborates with them. Deakins has worked on every film by Mendes after Road To Perdition, except of course Away We Go. Deakins is definitely one of the crucial fraction in making this film feel and look beautiful. The highlights are the scenes that takes place in Macau and Shanghai, this is where the image makes an impression with popping colors and employing a modern style of photography. The action sequences are handled very well as Deakins and Mendes allows the stunt men or actors to show off their skills within that one shot allowing for a much more smoother experience. As the start of the film, the image feels more natural and then heads towards a more colorful approach in the scenes in Asia. The end takes a monotone palette stripping the image down with the beauty that accommodates the first three quarters of the film, correlating with the themes that Mendes was trying to project (particularly the traditional vs contemporary aspect).Thomas Newman who have worked with all of Mendes' films, aside from Away We Go. Newman a lot of the times doesn't make scores that people will end up taking notice while watching the film, though there are a few exceptions like American Beauty and WALL-E, but he does have the ability to suck us in and allow us to feel the emotions that Mendes wants us to feel in selected occasions. Newman's score for Skyfall projects that and avoids the feeling of being campy even if it doesn't deviate too far from the modern day action scores. His score just works seamlessly with the traditional Bond theme that is scattered throughout which adds on to the immersion.Craig comes back for his third attempt of playing James Bond and he has done a wonderful job, as expected. There may be a bit of a step back for Craig here as the emotional driven scenes are not handled by him but rather by Judi Dench as M. Dench was able to embody a character who has a lot of regrets in her life and the audience can see how fractured her soul is with people fallen under her command. Bardem was a great villain in this film, making himself very memorable and tries to outshine any actor in the scene with him. Fiennes is an actor that always brings his best in whatever role he is in and he has done so here but he was limited here in screen time. The bond girls, Naomie Harris and Bérénice Marlohe, were fantastic here. I love seeing women who can carry their own or at least bring something unique and fresh to a formula that has been recycled over and over again. Harris was a standout in balancing sexy and toughness while Marlohe on the other hand brings out the lustful desires of the audience while not being there just for a good time with Bond.Skyfall is definitely a milestone for the Bond series and it sets up for a new phase in the series. If you enjoy a new twist in the same formula, beautiful photography and brilliant direction then give this one a try. I hope Mendes' 24th Bond film will just be as good as this, maybe even better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Best James Bond film by Daniel Craig,"Of the three James Bond movies that Daniel Craig has done, this one is by far the best. The plot is easy to follow, quick paced, and action packed.

Although the movie does seem to drag on for just a bit too long, you'll walk away feeling like it was time well spent. Also, their is a bit of romance in the film as well, which may make it more entertaining for some people. The film is good because it gives a bit of the backstory to why Bond is as he is.

Shaken but just not the right recipe and ingredients,"With a bond movie, one can never go into the hall wanting more of the same yet also hoping for something unique and spectacular in each edition. Skyfall is an attempt to stir up something different as a genre within Bond series but for me it fails to leave any sort of indelible imprint. Right from the opening trademark action sequence, you are left hoping fervently that as the script turns the corner something more gripping, more slick, more intense, laden with twists and turns would emerge. Sadly nothing of that sort happens and it ploughs through all the usual windings . Bond going missing, checking in again, crossing paths with a mysterious exotic woman. There is a heavy role for M and it is a strong performance by the Dame as contours of a tumultuous relationship between M and Bond is set out. Daniel Craig grows older and grows into the Bond role with ease and a more humane persona is presented to the audience. Someone who is still fit yet shown with his foibles. He is no more just suave but someone who is also weary, resigned and yet a soldier and patriot. In the end, there is no standout moment, there is no pulse racing sequence, no smouldering exchanges with a strong lady character, nothing by way of a script that makes you think even a fraction. It does have some soul by way of certain relationships, by way of a rather uncharacteristic villain and Javier Bardem is superb and very assured. A word about the Bond women. Berenice Marlohe is beautiful in a not so usual way and hence I feel that she has just been marginalised and there could have been a lot more for her in this movie. Naomie Harris is a bit of a stereotype and again exchanges involving her can just about make you smile feebly. Just as the opening, the climax is very staid ""bad guys lay siege and chase the good ones outnumbered and holed up behind the lines"" and as movies closes, we are plain and simple assured of another Bond sequel and just as I started the movie and was hoping for something spectacular to emerge at every bend, I simple longed for something more and better as the credits rolled on..Maybe next time - Bond Loyalist.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

unambigously a pleasurable movie-going experience,"007 is after a hard-drive. In the opening a chase, one of those breathless ones that populate a lot of Bond films, ensues, but it being Bond he has to get a little flashy (but just a little) when it comes to a train: on top of it, with a bulldozer on it, and then a fight with the baddie right there. After a botched 'Take a shot!' order from M, Naomie Harris' agent sends Bond off the train and into... death(?) Or just a little vacation from Mum ('M', Judi Dench believable as ever, even more conviction as she gets older), who has to deal with this drive still missing, this explosive MacGuffin that calls to question what MI6 is actually *doing* in the first place? Are there 'shadows' anymore? Or are there just freaks with revenge plots that take years and meticulous planning to shape? But Bond is Bond (and word is Bond), so he returns. But will it all be the same?A real ""MOVIE"" in big capital letters (much like The Avengers and The Cabin in the Woods earlier this year). A meaty thriller that takes itself seriously, but it never takes itself SO seriously that it becomes a film, which may be the key difference between this and the Dark Knight (which is what Mendes claims was the inspiration... or was it what he wanted to critique in a way? Skyfall acts as tribute to Bond, its own cohesive unit as a 007 entry, AND film-analysis of what makes Bond work compared to other blockbusters). Does it always make sense for 007 to make a quip after something tragic like a death of someone close to him? But, hey, it's another glass of scotch that shan't go to waste as well.It's a solid plot, the visual pleasures via Roger Deakins where every shot, every unit in an action set piece, get even MORE gorgeous on repeat viewings (the entire Shangahi-tower sequence is so breathtaking because it''s about how we watch it, it calls attention to itself carefully but deliberately with many mirrored images, like a neon-lit fun-house ala Orson Welles, but with silhouettes and a thrilling Thomas Newman back-beat).And while Javier Bardem slithers with gay joy here (both the gayness of a 1950's happy-go-lucky kid with a bunch of ""radio"" toys, and a vengeful man who may have been decent once but it's long gone in innuendo and grandiosity made flesh), Craig is also keenly subtle when he wants/needs to be, and it adds to him being such a bad motherf****r (look, seriously, it's right on that gun that only he can shoot). Not to mention Ben Whishaw earning his marks as the new 'Q' as a 'kid with spots', and Harris being Earthy, sensual, but can also hold her own when the action comes down. If anyone is given more humdrum work to do it's, oddly enough, Ralph Fiennes. That's alright - Skyfall needs one guy waiting in the wings to fully join the franchise.Bond is resurrected once more, and his hobby is spine-tingling, and at the same time about what it's about: you love Bond, it's a treat, you're a newcomer, it's good storytelling about a story that isn't new but not tired, and for those who couldn't care less about Bond... well, at least watch the opening titles and every nano-second with Bardem.

Awful,"Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear. Mendes tried so hard, and I respect him for it, especially with him being one of my favourite directors. You could see with every scene in Skyfall him trying to inject his usual brilliance, the emotion and absolute conviction of what truth is to be said that makes his other films so varied, dynamic and meaningful. Most of the directing was fantastic. But the script and the story were too majorly flawed for it to be in any way a decent film.Acting from the usually brilliant Javier Bardem was questionable throughout, almost parody-villain, and whilst the rest of the tip top cast tried their hardest, by the end their character motivations were so strained and to the point of absurdity that what starts as a dull and uninspiring romp just ends up becoming confused. The dialogue was wooden and in hurriedly tripping over its own feet to be sexy, sassy and 007 it became a caricature of a caricature of dialogue from previous films. The interesting exploration of who Bond really is that made Casino Royale so delectable has definitely been shrugged off, to be replaced by a Bond so depressed by his own existence you wonder what's the point in even watching him.There were some fun jokes and moments of nostalgia that made you smile (though even the nostalgia was overdone) but other than that it was a complete and utter mess. It was better than Quantum of Solace, but that's not really saying much.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond returns to defend MI6 from internal enemies.,"Classic Bond returns with lot of logic, maturity and emotions. He has certainly aged but manages to stay divine. Intricate relations and complex situations distinguish this film from previous Bond movies. No traditional non-stop larger than life stunts on exotic places, no unnecessary cheesy sleazy encounters with ladies. Skyfall is certainly not a regular bond movie. Judi Dench's presence as 'M' is more charismatic than Bond himself.

One of the best Bonds.,"Back in 2006 Martin Campbell's sensational Casino Royale re-imagined Britain's most famous spy as a flawed human that could make mistakes and feel real emotion. Gone were the gimmicky gadgets, onslaught of one-liners, self-referential acting and many more traditional 007 staples, this was a real-world Bond on show. Direct sequel Quantum of Solace took this too far and became excessively serious and sombre; its sense of fun had diminished to the point of non-existence. Enter acclaimed director Sam Mendes – not to mention world-renowned cinematographer Roger Deakins whose work here is second to none – and the franchise is not only back on track, but on a high. Skyfall is undoubtedly the most nostalgic (and humorous) Daniel Craig-era instalment, but it's also the most dramatically tense. Parts of Bond's back story are explored and he, along with Judi Dench's M, have their strongest emotional arc in a single movie to date. Between amusingly light-hearted encounters with the new-age Q (Ben Whishaw) and fellow field agent Eve (Naomie Harris), 007 must navigate through maternal surrogacy issues with M (Dench is thankfully given a larger and juicier role than in previous outings) in addition to dealing with the intensely vengeful Silva (Javier Bardem), who wields the power to bring down both MI6 and Bond's way of living. It's credit to Bardem that his villain is so obviously cut from the same over-the-top cloth of vintage Bond baddies (his introductory scene is both hilarious and menacing), yet retains a grounded stature that makes his life-threatening deeds instantly impactful and with severe consequences. There's more to chew on thematically for sure, but with a runtime of almost two and half hours the action and all-round excitement hasn't been skimped on. Look no further than the frenetic opening sequence that goes from a motorbike chase atop the Grand Bazaar to a fist fight on top of a moving train, with hardly a chance to breathe, which then segues into the typically awesome title design and Adele's beautifully old-fashioned title song. An underground escape by Silva and a courtroom shoot-out are other examples of heart-pounding action whilst a lusty casino-set meeting with reluctant henchwoman Severine (Berenice Marlohe) well and truly brings sexy back to the series. Simultaneously harking back to the good old days whilst energetically pushing towards the future, Skyfall can lay claim to being one of the best Bond flicks of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A villain from M's past haunts MI6 while Bond is tested by his biggest threat yet.,"Skyfall Daniel Craig, Judi Dench, Javier Bardem Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris Directed by Sam MendesThe 23rd Bond film in the 50-year-old franchise is terrific. The disappointing, horrible, and cottage cheese-like James Bond movie that is Quantum of Solace was a terrible sequel to the fantastic Casino Royale. You would think after that disgrace of a movie Daniel Craig might be finished as playing the amazing spy right? WRONG. Skyfall has everything that a classic Bond movie needs while at the same time being like no other. This movie has swag. There are so many things going for this movie. This is the third Bond installment with Daniel Craig at the helm and this was also his best performance as Bond yet. Sean Connery ""was"" my favorite actor who played James Bond, but after seeing Skyfall I think Daniel Craig is the best. He's that good. Also Javier Bardem (No Country For Old Men) is this villain with a weird blonde wig and he is really good in this as well. The plot is hard to explain. After being injured in a mission, Bond must try to get back into the swing of things while an enemy from M's past comes back to haunt her. This puts 007 in a position where he needs to protect M and must try to defeat this villain whose always one step ahead. What is ""Skyfall""? That is a secret you will find out after seeing this great movie. This is the first Bond movie directed by an Oscar winning director, Sam Mendes (American Beauty). This is also the best ""shot"" Bond movie ever made. Cinematography- just ""wow"". If you paused it at any moment in the movie and took a screen-shot it would be a good picture. To add to this ""list"" of amazing things going for Skyfall, Adele sings the theme song. Skyfall is one of the best movies of the year and what I think is one of the best James Bond movies ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Definitely one of the better Bond movies,This is Daniel Craig's third Bond movie. The first of these was very good and the second a bit disappointing. The good news is that the third is very good again.As ever the opening sequence is thrilling and sets up the movie. There's an interesting twist on the titles sequence which is pretty good. The plot of the movie revolves around the loss of a list of identities of all the British spies around the world. Bond must discover who has this list and then recover it before it endangers the lives of all the spies. Obviously the why they have it is also very important and this becomes the crux of the film.Daniel Craig was very good throughout and in particular in the early part of the film where he shows some of Bond's flaws. As ever Judy Dench was good in support and there also several other good supporting roles. The best part of the movie is that it leaves you wanting more and I'm certainly looking forward to the next episode.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Bond is back, better than ever! Skyfall is a cinematic joy, visually stunning.","The way I love Skyfall, as well as all of the Daniel Craig Bond films, is unparalleled.Until Daniel Craig took the helm of James Bond, I didn't have much appreciation for the Bond franchise. I had seen clips of the early movies but since most of them were before my time, I wasn't familiar with the history of the franchise. And then , sadly for me, my first foray into Bond was Pierce Brosnan. Those movies were everything I detest - phony, poorly acted, poorly written, Michael Bay type movies with no realism or story. And I hated them with intense passion. So when I heard about the reboot, I was less than excited.Well, imagine my surprise when I saw Casino Royale in the theatres, and it went on to be one of my all-time favorite films (and I see a LOT of movies). It was beautiful, featuring exotic locales, brilliant acting and a script so good it moved me to tears. While I very much enjoyed Quantum of Solace, it lacked a little of CR's magic. Needless to say, by this point I had fallen in love with Craig's Bond, the character and the iconic role he portrayed.So after 4 agonizing years, Skyfall lands in theatres. I am happy to say that it is a stunning masterpiece. Cinematically perfect, visually stunning, each segment of the film was more beautiful than the last. Director Mendes really brings sheer beauty to every shot, as if the screen is a canvas with paintings coming to life. He made colors pop and did dazzling work with lighting contrast in ways I've not seen. Each segment had a unique look to it, almost like mini movies throughout. Then of course there was the brilliant story (now a given), incredible acting and beautiful, haunting music. There were so many nods to past Bond incarnations which was such a delightful treat on the eve of the 50th Anniversary. Mr. Fleming would be most proud, I've no doubt.Skyfall is everything I could want in not just a James Bond flick, but a film in general. Can't wait for 007 24!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"You'll laugh, you'll scream, you'll cheer and you'll cry; ""Skyfall"" has it all.","Even after 50 years, James Bond still has it.Daniel Craig reprises the iconic role as the world's favorite super-spy in ""Skyfall"", the 23rd 007 film overall and 3rd to star Craig. The plot follows a decrepit Bond as he has to track down a villainous cyberterrorist, who is targeting MI6.Right off the bat, this film gets rolling. The opening teaser is arguably the best in the series, with Bond and MI6 operative Eve (Naomie Harris) chasing an assassin (Ola Rapace) through Istanbul by car, motorcycle, and train. Battling the assassin on top of a train, Bond is accidentally shot by Eve, and presumed dead. After M (Judi Dench) finds that MI6 is under attack, the need for Bond is greater than ever.Sam Mendes directs his action sequences surprisingly well. Mendes has a great way of making every shot, even if it is a boring, long shot of nothing, beautiful and engaging. Part of this goes to cinematographer Roger Deakins, for every single shot if sharp, clear, and beautiful. Bravo to these guys. Great job.Of course, Daniel Craig kills it as Bond. He just seems to be getting better and better as 007. Javier Bardem is a true monster as the devilish villain Silva, who is rather frightening and disturbingly diabolical. The ""Bond girls"", Naomie Harris and Berenice Lim Marlohe, are both good, but are rather underused. I understand why they weren't in the movie for a very long period of time, but I can't help but ask for a little bit more screen time for the Bond girls! Ralph Fiennes and Ben Whishaw are both standouts in there supporting roles, with the latter making Q relevant again. Oh, and not to forget Judi Dench, giving her best performance as M since ""GoldenEye."" She's awesome.The story, albeit very linear, is actually refreshingly simple after the headache-inducing complexity of ""Quantum of Solace"". The script does have its imperfections at times, including a third act that has been heavily criticized. I, personally, loved the third act. Yes, it is a bit flimsy, but the action and intensity overshadow the logic. (NOTE: All you die-hard Bond fans out there, be looking for all the subtle references to other adventures in this. Its full of easter eggs)THE VERDICT ""Skyfall"" is a memorable and action-packed film. It is most definitely the best film of 2012 since ""TDKR"". Filled with snappy dialogue, a great story, and a lead performance that you're likely not to forget, ""Skyfall"" is the best Bond ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Skyfall...probably the best Bond movie ever...!!,"After watching Daniel Craig in ""Casino Royale"" and ""Quantum of Solace"" I used to frequently think he is so apt conceiving the image of Bond as a no nonsense yet captivating guy..now after watching ""Skyfall"" i am pretty sure that he is one of the best to portray Bond even in the league of Sean Connery I would say..Now if you are a great fan of the ""Bond gadgets"" you would be a touch disappointed with Skyfall, just because there is nothing much of it..also the length of the movie is about 2.5 hours which is not normal for a James Bond movie. But all these ""faults"" (if you would call them) gives away to the extremely well crafted movie that is ""Skyfall"". The script is a winner all the way along with the performance of the lead actors.Craig is just superb as Bond with is now-famous rugged looks and the dialog delivery and as always he excels in the action sequences which are choreographed superbly. When you say about performance you would not want to miss to mention about Javier Bardem who plays the Villain in the film and that of Judi Dench as ""M"". Bardem stands equal to Craig and is undoubtedly one of the best villains in the Bond movies. Judi Dench has an extended role in this compared to the previous ones and she does a fantastic job with it.Bond girls were a let down though I have to say...Naomie Harris doesn't have any chemistry with Craig and is a let down with regard to her performance. It was fascinating to see the script focusing about Bond's childhood and showcasing the affection and respect Bond and ""M"" has towards each other.Even though I felt the climax a bit dragging it was not at all a flaw considering the whole package was just awesome..",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Technical Aspects Means It's An Oscar Contender,"You know to expect with a Bond film - girls , gadgets , stunts and excitement in a story that is pure escapism . In other words they're enjoyable rubbish . The formula changed somewhat with the arrival of Daniel Craig in CASINO ROYALE where the story is much more character driven . QUANTUM OF SOLCACE was a slight step backwards but upon hearing Oscar winning director Sam Mendes was going to direct the latest film in the Bond franchise SKYFALL it was going to be the Bond film people either love or hate. After just seeing it I can say it's a film I absolutely lovedOne should admire the courage of the producers in making a Bond film that while on the surface follows the formula of the franchise is a quantum leap away from what the audience is used to . Bond is now a vulnerable complex character who has self doubt and the characters around him exist in the real universe . Gareth Mallory is a former SAS soldier and a reference is made to his time in Northern Ireland . Q isn't a wizard who can conjure invisible cars out of thin air , he's a computer nerd and his armoury is limited to guns and tracking devices and much of the plot revolves around Bond's boss M . In other words this is the most realistic Bond movieBut it's the technical aspects that probably sets SKYFALL apart from the rest of the series . Roger Daeakins the cinematographer has been Oscar nominated eight times without success and he's made the most visually striking Bond movie . A sequence in Shanghai where Bond follows an assassin in to an office block where the action takes place in front of advertising screens has a hypnotic beauty rarely seen in cinema never mind a Bond movie . Likewise the editing which is handled by Stuart Baird is very impressive and is a million miles away from QUANTUM OF SOLACE which ruined that movie for a lot of people . I expect both Deakins and Baird to be at least Oscar nominated for their efforts with a few other nominations for the technical crew . This is the best Bond film from a technical viewpointSome things don't work work however . The plotting has upset a few people and as has been mentioned some of the storyline seems to be forgotten about like the abrupt disappearance of Bond after the the opening sequence . There's also few other irritating plot holes like this and it's never a good sign that a film has several screenwriters . One bone of contention is that much of the story takes place in mundane locations such as London and Scotland . One does wonder if it's a film that will appeal to a British audience rather than an American/international one ? One point that will spilt audiences is how low key the villain's aim isIf there's one disappointment for me it's Javier Bardem as the baddie . It;s often been said that good actors make for unimpressive Bond villains and Bardem does ironically chew up the scenery as Silva who seems to be the MI6 version of Hannibal Lector . There also seems to be a homosexual subtext to the character that remains unexplored . One also can't help noticing Kincaid , Bond's childhood gamekeeper, should have seen Brian Cox cast instead of Albert FinneyBut all in all SKYFALL has been one of the most entertaining nights out at the cinema I've had in a long time . Some people will no doubt hate what the producers have done but I'm glad to see a character driven Bond film based in the real world . As I said it's a film of technical hypnotic almost poetic beauty and I expect it to pick up a few Oscar nominations. If Roger Deakins doesn't win an Oscar for this the next Bond film will need a plot involving a baddie letting off a nuclear device on Oscar night",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Craig is Bond for the 21st Century,"I enjoyed this latest installment in the Bond series. I saw all of the Bond films during their first releases. In the 50th anniversary year of the franchise, Skyfall makes playful references to Bond films past and also establishes some roles for future episodes. This mission is of a more personal nature and takes place in today's world, where politics are related to terrorism and terrorism's greatest weapon is most likely a computer.The story knowingly uses the blond villain convention, something that might seem cartoon-like. But Daniel Craig's Bond is anything but the infallible superhero. He is world weary and cynical. Perhaps he is more the hero because he must overcome his limitations. The entire cast is great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Daniel Craig Is Not Bad,"Bond's loyalty to M is tested when her past comes back to haunt her. Whilst MI6 comes under attack, 007 must track down and destroy the threat, no matter how personal the cost.At first, it took some getting used to, because Daniel Craig (despite being English) looks more Russian than anything else. He could be Vladimir Putin's brother, and would make a great Bond villain. But once I adjusted, he was actually quite good at the role, even if not as suave as Timothy Dalton or Sean Connery.And having Javier Bardem as a villain was a stroke of genius. He plays bad guy roles well, and it is great to see him getting more and more exposure for international audiences. Truly a treasure of the screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
An outstanding disappointment,"What a weak movie! after the fascinating Casino Royale the newest film of the bond series is the weakest film of the Daniel Craig Bond era. the screenplay and the storyline are unacceptable... sometimes there are so stupid scenes that I thought that can't be true. It was a big disappointment from the beginning to the end of the Film. Sometimes the film is like a psycho- thriller and there are references to other films like Die hard or the Nolan films which are also abolutely problematic. The action scenes are without tempo and without creative elements. There are no gadgets and the simple storyline gives the film not much tension. The film is also twenty minutes too long.I think that Sam Mendes has absolutely failed to create a bond film. It was a major surprise for me and a very disappointing experience. I love Casino Royale.

""" He lives where all shadows live, . . . . in the Dark ""","This James Bond story was written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. In addition it was superbly directed by Sam Mendes. From the onset this new Bond film awakens the audiences with wall-to-wall action. When describing a superior movie as this one is, it's easy when recalling the heart-thumping, hair-raising introduction. Taken nearly from today's headlines. Bond is seen in dangerous high-flying mid-action when he travels from country to country confronting the enemies of the Crown. Upon returning home to England his secret organization of MI6 is attacked with a great loss of life. Bond and his boss 'M' (Judi Dench) come under great political criticism and nearly put out to pasture. However, that's when Bond (Daniel Craig) is at his best. He now seeks to learn who the shadowy mole is and vows vengeance. There is much drama in this movie as the audience follows Bond into the complex labyrinth of espionage where everyone is suspect. New Bond characters are added and several add to the mystique and intrigue like the new 'Q' (Ben Whishaw) and Eve.(Naomie Harris. In all, one can look forward to an explosive and entertaining movie.

Bloody Brilliant!,"Loved it, loved it, loved it! I had my doubts after watching the debacle that was Quantum of Solace, but I absolutely loved Skyfall. I think Skyfall is possibly my favourite of the Bond movies so far. I know purists out there are going to lynch me for not choosing one of the Connery-era films, but the fact is I didn't grow up watching Connery, I grew up with Roger Moore as Bond, so I never got to know the classic Bond. What I like most about the Daniel Craig Bond movies is that they are a lot more realistic, unlike the Moore and Brosnan ones. The crises in the Craig-era movies can actually happen in our reality (some might actually be happening right now) which makes it scary. I think the choice of director really made a difference here; Mendes has that good balance of visual flair, attention to character and story, and keeping the action tight and intense (a la Bourne). While Solace director Marc Foster is more suited to the smaller, intimate, agenda-driven dramas. Craig is on usual good form, I like Craig as Bond because we can relate to him; he puts on a tough demeanour, but his eyes betray his vulnerability. Judy Dench does a great job as M; I'm glad she gets more to do in Skyfall than just bark orders at Bond and covering his arse. Another sigh of relief is how subdued the women are in Skyfall. Usually the women take up too much screen time and are there just for eye-candy, although as a guy I love that, but it's very distracting! Javier Bardem is on creepy mode that makes his Chigurh character in No Country for Old Men seem tame by comparison; here's a guy who's actually a threat with brains and brawn to match. Ultimately, it's bloody brilliant!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best Bond Film Yet. Daniel Craig Is Awesome,"This is the best James Bond movie yet. Its really not same old MI6 going after the criminal but instead, it was completely the oppositeDaniel Craig was brilliant in his role as 007, Judi Dench as M played her part well. Pity she had to die in the end though. Naomi Harris was a bit disappointing for me because I expected more screen time for her but Javier Bardem as Sila in my opinion was the best antagonist ever since he is the only villain who really took it over the edge and brought MI6 down, forcing them to relocate elsewhereAll in all, an 8 out of 10 for me but still, it won't up there in my top 5 movie of the year list",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"The Best, and Only, James Bond Movie I've Ever Seen!","You read correctly, folks: This is the first James Bond movie that I've seen, at least all the way through. I guess that's not technically true; I guess I have seen one or two on television, but to be one hundred percent honest, they were pretty forgettable. However, if every Bond movie was like ""Skyfall"", then I'd go out and buy the entire collection.Honestly, I had no intention of seeing this movie. I saw the trailers, which looked pretty cool and also had the fortune of having Javier Bardem in them, but they didn't really impress me to such a degree that I'd actually go ahead and see the movie. But, as it turns out, I received an invitation from a friend to go and see it. And I came out of the theater satisfied.Director Sam Mendes said in an interview that ""The Dark Knight"" was a huge influence on this new installment in the Bond franchise and it really does show. This movie has deep emotional layers to it, alway staying a step ahead of its audience without entirely alienating them. The camera angles are very unique and really add something to the film.The nice thing about James Bond is that he's a staple of pop culture to such a degree that I already knew the character before I entered the theater. He's very suave and elegant, but also very hardcore and awesome. And Daniel Craig plays the part very well.Since I mentioned him when talking about the trailer, you could probably guess that I am a Javier Bardem fan. And he plays a villain that is so intimidating and so confident in how awesome he is, that he literally blows all other villains out of the water. There's a scene in a jail cell between him and M (played masterfully by Judi Dench) where he is so scary that it might as well have been Hannibal Lecter standing in that cell.Final verdict: I have no complaints about this film. Yeah, there's definitely some stuff to nitpick, but seeing as I'm not that type of person, Skyfall, to me, is a modern day masterpiece. The only reason it gets a 9 instead of a 10 is because I only score movies a 10 if it's one of my favorite movies. Still, if you're a fan of James Bond, I don't know how I could give this a proper recommendation since I haven't seen the other movies. But if you're looking for a great action movie that's a little deeper then you have been lead to believe, Skyfall is the film for you. It's one of the best movies of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
New meets old and... make a nasty drink,"Skyfall has a number of good things going for it: Javier Bardem is a great actor and Ralph Fiennes, even with a really small role in this film, is wonderful as well. Naomi Harris I've loved from her role as Tia Dalm, even if in this film she also is just being set up, just like Ralph Fiennes. Daniel Craig does a good role, as well, but he has already proved himself in the previous film.However, all this potential is practically wasted in a confused script that attempts to make a circular link between the old James Bond, with the cars and the gadgets and the queen and country stuff, with the new Bond, where computers and strategy is paramount compared to physical stuff. And they really try too much, they achieve little and make yet another ""fallible Bond"" film that pretty much bores people watching it in its two hours and a half.Bottom line: the starting credits have a complex visual background, heavy in computer graphics and hints on the film. The rest of the movie attempts to catch up with that which, I am sorry to say, is the best part of the film. Oh, and that guy Patrice is the husband of Noomi Rapace.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Let the Skyfall,"In the first shot, a man, out of focus and mostly hidden in the darkness, walks into the frame at the end of a long hallway, and the soundtrack blasts the first two, but only the first two, notes of the instantly recognizable James Bond theme song- which always makes me giggle, because I know that I'm in for a long, great ride with this film.In the film's pretitle sequence, Bond is badly injured, and falls from a great height, and is then presumed dead by the British government, mirroring the ending of Ian Fleming's novel, You Only Live Twice.Even after M. had nearly had Bond killed due to her rash orders, he still feels loyal to her, as news of a cyber attack in London brings him out of several months'worth of semi-retirement in Turkey, where he is met with a frigid response by M. upon his return.After being re-briefed and brought back into active duty (in a sequence echoing the beginning of Fleming's final novel, The Man With The Golden Gun) Bond follows a trail of breadcrumbs and learns of the nutjob's plot to disgrace and kill M., in retaliation for something she did in her past. After several innocent people are killed in the crossfire, Bond basically kidnaps M., and takes her ""to somewhere we'll have the advantage. Where it's just us and him."", ""back in time,"" to Skyfall.Skyfall. A grotesque looking structure. A two story rock house, turned black from decades of mould and mildew, enveloped in a thick fog in the Scottish Highlands, in the middle of a five square mile open field. Where Bond was born and raised. He hasn't been there in decades, not since his parents (Andrew and Monique Delacroix Bond) died, and are buried there. The open area is the perfect location, where no one can approach unnoticed, they have to come out into plain view, and no other innocent people can be injured or killed in the crossfire.After an elaborate, yet somehow smaller scale, and almost intimate, climactic battle at Bond's childhood home, M. dies of injuries sustained in the end. Bond's presence did little to affect the outcome, yet the plot centres around him, Ian Fleming's antihero.I never liked Judy Dench as M., but her death is very moving, very sad. The filmmakers managed to elicit sympathy from me about a character's death that I did not like. Furthermore, Bond was moved to tears over her death, where as M. seemed merely annoyed by Bond's possible death at the start of the film.A small cast of main characters gives this film a more intimate vibe, as does the villain's plot of revenge, rather than world domination. Also memorable in that the villain has no gimmicky henchmen in his employ.After destroying Skyfall, his childhood home, and subsequently killing the villain, Bond finally appears happy. Bond had to kill the past in order to be happy in the present.Fans of Ian Fleming's literary character will recognise many references to the ending of Fleming's You Only Live Twice, and the beginning of The Man With The Golden Gun, revealing more about Bond's past than all of the previous films in this series, like his parents' (Andrew and Monique De La Croix) death when Bond was a child; he was then raised by his aunt, Charmain.Coincidentally, my family died when I was the same age as Bond. I also have my childhood home, which I have not been to in years. The very thought of returning there, even to that area, greatly depresses me. Bond's parents are buried at the church on Skyfall, my dog (who I loved more than my family) is buried on the property. To further the coincidence, my backyard even faces a large church.I saw this film in cinemas more than 40 or 45 times, and I never grew tired of it, nor do I even notice the two and a half hours long runtime. Best Bond film ever, and my favourite movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Very Best and the Very Worst of Bond,"'Ladies and gentlemen, I'm delighted to inform you that Skyfall is Daniel Craig's best Bond film yet and amongst the top three of the entire franchise. Sam Mendes, you bloody genius, you!'So that was the opening sentence of the review I had expected to write after watching Skyfall, the twenty-third film in the James Bond franchise and the third starring the very intense Craig, given that the badass trailer had very literally left me delirious for days at end and the phenomenal hype had me convinced that I was in for the motion picture experience of a lifetime. And then, as is usually the case, I saw the movie.Before I make my case about the specific failings of the movie, which has a plot that puts Judi Dench's M and the MI6 directly in the line of danger, as Bond battles his body and the demons from his past to save the day, let's start with some reassurance that Skyfall, for the most part, is well worth a trip to the theaters.This is Craig's most accessible Bond movie to date; the most popcorn Bond, if you will. It's also his funniest Bond, with deadpan humour in huge dollops, at the most unexpected places.Director Mendes pulls out all stops to give us one of the most visually intoxicating Bond films too; the cinematography by veteran Roger Deakins is a class apart, and certain sequences — including the dazzling opening credits and a fight sequence filmed almost only in shadows – give the movie a tone that's fiercely original and still, fiercely Bond. The acting, from all quarters, is a delight: Craig and Dench have ""played this game long enough"", and Ralph Fiennes and the talented young Ben Whishaw (who was also fantastic in the recent Cloud Atlas) ably demonstrate that they aren't merely there to be cogs in the wheel, but that they truly belong.And to cite an analogy that'll perhaps be used freely in the days to come, Javier Bardem is the Joker to Bond's Dark Knight, even though Skyfall is the franchise's 'James Bond Rises'. Bardem, who makes one of the best-written entries in Bond history, is deliciously wicked, and constructs a frighteningly real villain with an uncomfortable, sinister presence that looms large over every scene he's a part of. In an alternate universe, Bardem would be the common villain to the Bond franchise, with a new Bond to foil him in every movie.This is where you should stop reading if you are only looking to be entertained by Bond's latest, and aren't necessarily interested in Skyfall, the movie.To be very honest, let me clarify that it's hard to point out exactly why the movie, which possibly has the best first act in action movies this side of the 2000s, goes wrong. It has all the quintessential Bond ingredients, and each of them spectacularly well-done at that, be it breath-taking beauties (both women and cars), dizzying action, crackling dialogue, an unconventional but remarkable choice of director, a terrifying and terrific villain, and a man's man in Bond, ""an old dog who has learnt new tricks."" But then again, if these were enough to make for a great movie, Agent Vinod would have been the greatest one ever made.The movie's biggest problem is the disjointed script that takes an exciting new turn every fifteen minutes, but by the end, ends up confused about where it was heading to in the first place. Take the premise itself: MI6 is under attack and the identities of several secret service agents are now in the wrong hands. But somewhere mid-way, these agents are all but forgotten as the plot shifts gears to a cat-and-mouse game for your typical action movie staple of vengeance.The movie is also filled with clichés. Here are some of the formulae that you'd expect Bond to avoid, but Skyfall revels in:1. When the bad guy is caught early in the movie, you know he wanted to be caught. 2. When the bad guy pulls a gun on the good guy early in the movie, he is not going to pull the trigger. 3. When the bad guy pulls a gun on the good guy at the end of the movie, he is going to give a speech. 4. When the specific quality of a particular weapon is spoken of and dismissed, you know that's the quality that will save the day in the end.Then there's the problem of the Bond girl who serves as much purpose in the movie as that 'Smoking causes cancer' ads serve at the beginning of it – she doesn't. Bardem's splendid villain is given a shockingly ill- etched out characterisation too, and his job through the movie is waiting it out for the good guy to thwart his bad moves. There's also the bit about Bond's backstory, which seems trite and forced and would've made no difference to the movie had it been left out.Truth is, all would have been forgiven had the grand finale been as devastating as was promised. Instead, we get an ode (?) to – without giving it away, a famous children's film - that seems in scale and impetus, a significant departure from the tone of the movie, as well as the franchise itself. Good or bad, it just doesn't feel like Bond.My complaint with Skyfall is that somewhere in between the entertainment, the CGI, the stunts and the twists, there was a great movie to be found. But it fell through the cracks into the abyss and only a James Bond can locate it now. This is a Bond that's both same and different to the earlier editions, and that's possibly the reason the movie ends up being, at once, both the very best of Bond and the very worst of Bond.Nikhil Taneja (www.twitter.com/tanejamainhoon)For more reviews: http://www.firstpost.com/author/nikhil",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond gone bland..,"Without giving away the plot; The opening sequence is tame. The supporting actress should have stayed on Blue Peter. All the Bond clichés are as predictable as panto. Who ever had the bright idea of putting a poor version of Richard Ayoade from the IT crowd in as Q should actually be shot. The one liners are very droll and again predictable. The story line is shallow and yet again, predictable. The writers (Pervis, Wade & Logan) were trying to make up for it with grandiose bold sensationalism the like of which would not be unfamiliar in the Murdock Empire. It is as if you gave Jeremy Clarkson a plasterers trowel and expected him to copy Cezanne. This incarnation of Bond has lost his suave sophicatedness and we're left with a punch and Dame Judy show.The good parts. Dame Judy is, as she is always, masterful. Daniel Craig is still the best bond in my eyes and he plays the part of a broken burnt out yet thoroughly committed, doggedly determined and loyal servant to the Crown admirably. Berenice Marlohe is a Bond girl through and through top marks 10 out of 10. She's as good as any Femke Jansen or Ursula Andress and that's saying something. However her character was sparingly used. I would have like to see her play a more central role. I think we missed out.However, in short, if was on TV on a lazy Sunday afternoon and the remote was out of reach I'd watch it again, otherwise, don't bother.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond Fell,Bond at 50? Too bad. This film is no cause for celebration. The script was credited with 3 writers and it shows. The 1st set piece was well executed but recalls Bourne series. The dragon boat casino set piece looks like old Hollywood films from the 40's with cardboard caricatures of Chinese villains and damsels in distress. The nail in the coffin was the long finale with the plot so old and silly that it's not worth mentioning. Daniel Craig looked so old and worn out in the first half of the film. The casting was good but the poor and incomplete story lines and script rushed the whole film down the tube. Even Sam Mendes cannot revive it. It is probably the worst Bond film to date.,3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
And Bond Keeps Rolling Along,"I have to say that it has been a while since I've seen a Bond film and this is the first one that I have seen with Daniel Craig in the lead role. I don't remember a 007 film being this long, but I have to say that the adventures of Bond are sure to continue. I just hope that they won't start doing them in pairs, like what they did with the Twilight film (part 1 and part 2). From the trailer, you could tell that James Bond comes back from his supposed demise and has to regenerate himself to protect his fearless leader. The one thing that the film does not explain is exactly how he survived the fall off that bridge. They may have shown it after they ran the credits at the end. I have found that more and more films are doing that, which I hate. Especially since this film was so dog gone long. I think that Daniel Craig did a decent job portraying 007, but I was not used to seeing the super spy so down-trodden. Hopefully he will be more charismatic in the next one (if he is still cast). Dame Judi Dench was a formidable ""M"" and was hardened and definitely goal oriented to the task at hand. Javier Bardem was very convincing as the crazy and totally ""out there"" villain Silva. He was as nutty and demented as Heath Ledger's Joker. He did a brilliant job making you hate him but at the same time, you wanted to know what the heck he was going to do next. The one thing that I did miss in this film was the abundance of gadgets that are usually introduced, but the film definitely worked without them. It turns out that Ben Whishaw's ""Q"" was almost too smart for his own britches, but I like the fact that he was a young character. I hope that they bring back Naomie Harris who played Eve in the next film. I think that she and Daniel had great chemistry on screen. This film did hold true to everything that is the amazing ""Bond"". Although this is yet another butt blister film, it is worth paying the price of a ticket to see it on the big screen. I have to say that the only thing that was missing while viewing this film was a dry martini (shaken, not stirred). I give this film a glaring green light.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Craig is raw, harsh, brutal and hurting.","The rumours built anticipation, the trailer thrilled, the theme song disappointed. The expectation is that Skyfall will be the highest grossing Bond film of all time and Daniel Craig may be the first Bond to garner an Oscar nomination. But could the film possibly stand up to the hype?I grew up in the Roger Moore years and thought he was the bee's knees. As a more discerning cineaste I respected the killer in Timothy Dalton's eyes, though he suffered for the weak films he was dropped into. After the cheesy romantic Brosnan period, Bond was reborn and I cheered very loudly, much to the chagrin of the next door neighbours, when I read that Daniel Craig was to utter those immortal five words.Craig is raw, harsh, brutal and hurting. Know this: James Bond is a killer. It's what he does. Craig's 007 will slot a bullet between your eyes for Queen and country and, outwardly, he won't waste a nanosecond considering the emotional consequences. Because that is his job. No, you wouldn't mess with him and, yes, he is the best 007 yet.But despite the proclamations, Skyfall is not the best Bond film; that accolade, for me, belongs to Casino Royale. Director Sam Mendes hasn't broken Bond, not by a long way, but he has dented it and if they don't repair those dings pretty sharpish, they will rust and cause irreparable damage. Mendes must take the responsibility as he is the top dog on set but the damage has been caused by screenwriter Messrs. Purvis, Wade and Logan. Mendes stated he wanted to inject humour into Bond and from the first twenty minutes or so it was written beautifully. The smiles came from crisp, disposable comments that flowed in conversations, but as Skyfall unfolds scenes are ended with self-conscious, cheesy quips and exchanges and almost blatant winks at the camera. We haven't stepped back to the Moore years but we have certainly suffered a horrible slip to the edge of the Brosnan era Bond.Barbara Broccoli, if you're reading this, please, for the love of all things Bond, stop now, retrace your steps and take Bond back where he belongs; to the dark, reality of espionage and terror that excites us but makes us wee our pants just a little bit in fear. That is who Bond should be.But Skyfall is an extremely good film. Its 143-minute running time sprints past with enough variation in the pace for us to catch our breath and keep up without allowing the heart rate to settle into a relaxed rhythm. Craig is on blistering form, momentary scripted bombs aside, and not once do we believe he is anything but serious or anything less than capable, even when the story suggests otherwise.Skyfall rattles along from the fresh MGM opening sting to the final crescendos, both visually and aurally, as the last of the credits fade. Mendes et al are clearly aware this is Bond's 50th anniversary and there are numerous references to bygone Bonds though, mercifully, no painful cameos from the men who played him. Most are subtle enough to be enjoyable but one jars; it cuts against the naturalistic grain of the film and all but contradicts an exchange between Bond and the excellent new Q (Ben Wishaw):Bond: A gun and a radio? Q: What? You were expecting an exploding pen? We don't really go in for that any more.But in the final act we are thrown a series of references and sequences from that bygone era. What was Mendes playing at?The cast is impeccable. Javier Bardem as Silva is not just a 'bad guy' but a genuine, hope you never meet him anywhere, villain. He is beautifully restrained when first we meet him and our chuckles emerge when the character plays with us, not when we laugh at the funny man. And as he slowly unhinges himself from reality we understand the palpable fear that Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe) fails to disguise in her shaking hand.As ever, the relationship with Craig's Bond and Judi Dench's M is absolutely compelling. The two actors have a rare chemistry that doesn't require a sex scene to make it noticeable. At times she is mother to his petulant teenager but there is a mutual respect, an admiration that veers towards a familial love. And, in M's case, a genuine fear of what she has created.Naomie Harris is a joy to watch. Though she's produced some startlingly good work (28 Days Later, White Teeth) only in Skyfall has she finally stepped into limelight. Perhaps, if we are very fortunate, she will break the 'Bond girl' curse and have a career that continues to ascend rather than evaporate post-event. Next year's Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom is a very hopeful start.Equally, both Wishaw and Ralph Fiennes, as government man Gareth Mallory, stand tall as characters that command our attention with solid, determined performances. Wishaw's Q is quirkily engaging but there is clearly far more to him than the cuddly, buffoonery of Desmond Llewelyn and, hopefully, he'll have a more positive impact than the pantomime fool played by John Cleese. Fiennes, meanwhile, sets Mallory up as a hateful man within the fold but his evolution through Skyfall is gently handled to great effect.Skyfall is a very definite statement of intent. Some of that intent concerns me but mostly it is the reason I'll return for a second viewing this week.No, Skyfall is not the best Bond film ever. But it is remarkably good, it will leave you reeling and it is imperative you don't ask and don't let anyone tell you anything about it.See it now and then keep your mouth firmly closed.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Skyfall....fitting title,"First of all the movie in its own right is a fairly good one. The trouble i have with this one is the direction it went...BACKWARDS. Producers went with ""out with the new and in with the old"" and dug up the old bond formula.That really saddens me, because we already had 20+ bond movies with that formula end really could use the new direction the previous 2 bond-movies went.In all Fairness this movie is good to watch, your interest level during the movie screening will not drop but as the old bond formula is used it becomes fairly predictable.Just my 2 cents.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Best James Bond movie??? I don't now, but probably.","50 years, 24 films (some classics, some fun, some horrible), and finally on his 50th birthday, James Bond deliver's, in what many say is his best movie of all time, and there is much to prove it. After the weak movie that was ""Quantun of Solace"", the 007 has been absent for 4 years, many thought it would last forever, but finally in 2012 thanks to Sam Mendes, James Bond had his respect long lost, back and big.""Skyfall"" is the 007 movie that we deserve, it gave us a true spectacle that has long not been seen. Joint elements of the old classic James Bond films, we see a bit of ""Dr. No"", ""Goldfinger"", ""The man with the golden pistol"", ""Goldneye"", ""Casino Royale"".We see a James Bond more mature and realistic, but at the same time with the classic elements of old movies (the little tools and the jokes are mild examples). Daniel Craig is better than ever was, proving to be one of the best actors of James Bond; Javier Barden is a very clever and cruel villain, one of the best (if not the best) James Bond villains ever had. But I must mention that I see in ""Skyfall"" a lot of elements from ""The Dark Knight"", the villain is an example, all the movements of the hero were planned by the villain, and the main threat is part of a much larger plan (and even some scenes, but I will not spoil anything).""Skyfall"" proves that James Bond is immortal and has much more to deliver, Sam Mendes saved the franchise and I hope he direct's the many others that are yet to come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A terrific 'modern' Bond. A long way from 'best ever' though.,"OK, no detailed plot dissection here. Yes of course there are holes, but sit back and drink it in.It is a proper Bond movie, it has the visuals, it has the action and it does have the girls, but all in a post Casino Royale style.Strong storyline and three dimensional characters. Javier Bardem's Silva is very close to being a 'classic' Bond Villain, if only the scriptwriters had thought a little bigger.And there it is. For those of us brought up on Bond in the 60's and 70's, the current fashion of 'grittier, more realistic, Bourne-esque' films will never completely satisfy us.Bond lost it's way really from the later Moore films ( though I personally think the two Dalton's are criminally underrated), but I still don't quite understand why the gadgets and volcano- dwelling villains with their eyes in World domination have been discarded.Bardem's portrayal of Silva is excellent; twisted, super intelligent and ruthless, but seemingly all he wants is a spot of personal revenge. Fine, but being the instigator of World War 3 is surely a little more exciting?Christopher Nolan made the perfect modern Bond movie with 'The Dark Knight Rises' and I for one would love to see him get a crack at a Bond sometime soon.But I digress. Skyfall is streets ahead of Quantum of Solace, probably not as good as Casino Royale, but is a decent addition to the modern era franchise. Well worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Not a true bond movie, just okay","This movie doesn't seem to be made with the Bond character in mind. Diverted theme. The only thing seemingly common with Bond saga is the naming of characters and MI6 is British. A bit of 'almost realistic' gadgets are thrown in, don't expect anything fancy, nothing Bond-like. Hell you don't even get some good length of Bond music. Pierce Brosnan was the last known icon for Bond fans. The slick skills of Bond are not there at all. Well, that said, there are a few good action scenes, which save the movie somewhat. If you are looking for more, skip this one. This is just a thriller movie, can't say its not a good thriller, but imprinting Bond's name on the package is false presentation. Lastly, for the next attempt, we need an actor who actually exudes character of Bond, at least the directors so far haven't made Daniel Craig come along like one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A little old Bond.... A little new Bond.,"James Bond has always been a sort of cut out character, I mean after twenty some odd films of which I've only see a fraction I feel like I know him just like the long lost uncle that only comes to town for thanksgiving once every five years or so. When a bar tender ask James what he would like to drink or an extremely active girl ask him whats under his coat. I've got an idea of what he is going to say. People probably identify with Bond in there own way make up stories of how he could live so many years and still look so young or get shot at so many times and still remain free of holes, all fans reinitialize and that part of what makes the character so great we want to be him for all of the reason we say are unrealistic. That is what makes James Bond....James Bond.This film to me is a very good mixing of what has been done before and work as well as dazzling a little bit of a fresh tone to make it new and exciting. The film has a very good easy to follow story, without spoiling anything for you it's very easy to follow and for the most part is vary straight forward which makes it very easy to identify with the characters it gives you time to think about emotion of the character who in the past while good, where sometimes just there to get from one action scene to the next. The character are a bit more developed and the motive of the main characters is very clear. Visually the movie is quite stunning the vibrate colors and lust mix of landscapes and warm indoor quarters really set the tone for the movie and amerce you in the story. Often the story is told through visuals and colors as well which is kind of rare to see in a Bond picture. The acting is excellent everyone puts there piece of the puzzle together so well you lose yourself and believe the people you are watching are truly those characters.In all Skyfall mixes the old with the new in such a way that it is a sure fire can't miss for any Bond fan and a lurking delight for those just in the mood for a good movie with a great story good acting and grand visuals.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Innovate the opening credits, the main theme, Bond's personality, everything should be transformed in a new look, because honestly, the 007 features are not bringing anything new...Cristopher Nolan expressed interest in directing a 007 film, so I say, let the guy make something!

"A beautiful, and Colourful, Crap.","I heard many reviews before seeing this film and they were somewhat varied though none were bad. The two main things i heard were either 'The classic Bond is back' or 'It was better than Quantum of Solace but not as good as Casino Royale'. I however thought it was worse than both and that the classic bond was not back. Craig gives an incredibly uninspired performance. The ending is reminiscent of Home Alone. The plot is poor and the villain seemed to replay Live Free Or Die-hard. The film had Craig try his hand at a one-liner or two to no avail. All this said the film did have some visual competence but, back to the negativity, was shot unwell. I just don't understand what the hype is around Skyfall, I very much enjoyed Casino Royale and thought that Quantum of Solace was alright as a part two and was visually stunning at all times (Granted they didn't feel like original Bond films). But Skyfall was, in my opinion, quite terrible throughout. The plot was rather pathetic and i felt like i had seen it before in multiple films. To sum this review up, i hated it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Disappointing, the critics lied to me","For their fiftieth anniversary outing the producers and writers of Skyfall have elected, without a hint of irony, to plagiarise from their progeny and the other films these have influenced. The plot line is lifted from the first Mission: Impossible, the tone and character arc from Bond devotee Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, and the framing device from the Bourne series. The set pieces are largely borrowed from the aforementioned films and a number of previous Bonds. They even take one of Bourne's stars in a barely recognisable Albert Finney, a role that should have had Bourne's Brian Cox written all over it. There are a couple good lines but most of them seem to have been produced using the random Bond line generator and are delivered exactly when anticipated. In short what we get is a lazily conceived film delivered by a committee of Hollywood pretenders. Unfortunately what we don't get is a Bond film, just another post Bourne Hollywood-style actioner, save for a few bones thrown to the fans in the third act (Bond's DB5 and the revealing of a key 'new' character). Other than M, female characters share about ten minutes of screen time and all Bond has to do is show up to get laid in stark contrast to Craig's previous two outings (in QoS he never gets laid at all). Which is astonishing given that here Craig has all the charisma of a sack of potatoes. These 'Bond girls' only serve as vehicles for exposition, one doesn't even get a line of dialogue, and one wears just the right amount of lipstick to make you wonder if she's really just a guy in drag. The introduction of Bardem's villain is the highlight of the movie but any promise this scene brings is then completely squandered. There is some particularly poor CGI in the rendering of Bardem's make up and two Komodo Dragons. As the end credits rolled I was left feeling this whole sorry exercise's sole purpose was to introduce three rather dull new actors / characters to the franchise. As a life long Bond aficionado I am deeply saddened and now resigned to the fact, save for another reboot, we'll never see another decent Bond film again.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Skyfall: Different, Refreshing, and Surprising, Just a little lack","This new James Bond Film in Daniel Craig tenure is somewhat different. The plot is the thing that can be said excellent, of course very much different. This movie has been matched with the current global issue dealing with more modern threat. The villain played by Javier Bardem can be said very good. He gives the villain character some differences from other villains That's for the plot. For the actors and the actress, the principal casts (James Bond, Eve, Q, Tanner, M, and Gareth Malory) have their parts almost equal. That's the first time ever in Bond Franchise that the Principal Cast do so. If you're a Bond Fans, you can refresh your mind about the previous Bond Film by watching Skyfall, since there are some direct references to the previous films, maybe for marking the 50th anniversary. This movie is also very surprising, that's why I urge you to watch if you haven't watched it yet.Somehow, this film is lack of what the series always have in the previous film. Among the principal casts, Berenice Marlohe as Severine is the weak part. She should have been given a more central role, even though she's in the opposite side of Bond. It's unorthodox, since any Bond Girls in the Franchise are given more central role, no matter of where they stand. The Bond Girls is the integrated part of the series, lacking their parts just seems like A tea without a sugar.For conclusion, this new film is a boost from the previous one, very different, Refreshing, and surprising, just lack what this film should have more.My Rating 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

The story itself is unusual for a Bond movie, but it gives more than enough references to the good old James Bond, especially Sean Connery's era. And even further, it takes James Bond to his roots. And finally, at the end of the movie comes the biggest surprise which makes the reboot comes to a full circle. What a way to celebrate 50 years of Bond movie!

A blistering Bond masterpiece,"Fade to colour. It is a dark corridor, lit ever so slightly by lights coming through the window. There is only the shadowy outline of a figure at the end of the corridor. Slowly, he starts to pace forward, gun in his hand. He comes right up to the camera, light falling across his blue eyes. Those piercing blue eyes. Cue music. That music.That's right, ladies and gentlemen. Bond is back. James Bond.It's been exactly fifty years since James Bond first hit our screen in Dr No and even now, twenty-three movies later, the character creates the same amount of excitement and curiosity he did at the beginning. I'll freely admit that, while a casual fan of the movies, I was never a die-hard. I've only seen a few of them, and they were good. I'm aware of all the famous characters, the gadgets, the famous stories – I know it all, pretty much, just without seeing the films. But, importantly, I'd seen both of the first Daniel Craig movies. Loved them. A die-hard fan of them. And so watching movie number three was inevitable.Skyfall is actually a refreshing change of pace from those first two movies. While they both followed the same narrative, this goes back to an old-school standalone Bond storyline. Bond is accidentally shot and presumably killed during an attempt to get back a stolen list of all NATO secret agents, thrusting MI6 into a cyber-terrorist plot. Bond does come back, obviously, to find and stop the man behind it.I'll cut to the chase: this was unbelievably good. There were reservations about Sam Mendes directing it, because he'd never directed an action movie before, but he goes well above expectation. The action sequences, first up, are excellent. Frenetic, edge-of-your-seat sequences that, in true Mendes style, are shot beautifully.But what Mendes brings to Skyfall is character development. These aren't just archetypal characters there to fulfil the Bond formula (with one exception that I'll get to). Everyone has a purpose, and we learn about them and invest in them emotionally. Bond's own journey in the movie is excellent, as is that of M (Judi Dench) and, most notably Javier Bardem as Silva. I'll go as far as to say that Bardem could, and rightfully should, be nominated for an Oscar. The guy is immense; it'll be hard for me to compare to other iconic Bond villains having not seen those films, but Silva is the perfect antagonist. He steals every scene he is in, with one-liners as well as simple tuts and sighs. Fantastic.In truth, they're all great. Craig, Dench, Bardem, Ben Wishaw as Q, Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes – Mendes has a cavalcade of top-notch actors and he makes good use of them. The only exception is Berenice Marlohe. As Severine, Marlohe is our Bond girl. And she is so underused and more or less irrelevant that I just didn't understand the need for her. Yes, they needed a Bond girl, so they had to have her. But I wish Mendes could have made better use of her. Ah well, no film can be perfect.Another aspect of the film that Mendes does so well is playing up the history and the stereotype of Bond without verging into satire. The iconic Bond car and gun are back, and there are numerous one-liners and wink-wink moments which only serve to enhance the story. This isn't the Bond that is nothing but serious and steely. This Bond incarnation from Craig has all the wit and charm people love from his predecessors.I won't go into spoiler territory, but some very important things happen in this movie. Like in The Dark Knight Rises, you're kept guessing until the very end. After what a lot of people consider a disappointing Quantum Of Solace, this is a blistering return to form. Again, no film can be perfect, but this came so close. Must-watch cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Good!,"Skyfall was a pleasant surprise for me, I saw it opening night and had not already heard all the rave reviews or read them and that's a good thing because otherwise I would have gone in to see the movie with really huge expectations that I'm not sure would have actually been met. The opening of the movie is amazing which is typical of any Bond movie and the villain was really good too, grounded in reality but still a hint of the cartooniness that works so well with Bond villains. Still not a huge fan of Daniel Craig as James Bond (I guess I am more of a traditional fan when it comes to how I like my James Bonds) but it's a good movie, if you like the more recent Bond movies you'll be very happy, it is probably the best Bond movie of the new bunch with Daniel Craig so definitely worth a look.

Ian Fleming might be happy but overall a bore,"I have been waiting all weekend to see Skyfall. I know most people either love or hate Daniel Craig as James Bond but I like him a lot. He is more hard edged and I think that's what the film makers intended. This movie come on the celebration of 50th years of Bond and I think the film makers wanted to come up with the real Bond the one Ian Fleming imagined..but ultimately Bond and the film are a lore. I know now if it has to do with the modern era of technology or what we expect more from our spies and Bond has always given us more, but not this time. They should have know that they we're going to get away with this kind of cerebral, soapy story after the failure of ""Tinker, Tailor,Soldier Spy."" Audiences want to keep somethings about their flawed heroes a secret. What did I like about Skyfall? The opening was great and Daniel Craig inhabits his character as does Judi Dench, Ralph Fiennes didn't do a bad job either. Javier Bardem tore up the scream and really had me liking his bad guy character until they ruin him in the end. What I didn't like? The story was okay but the lack of gadgets hurt and the new Q was boring. I know they believed that all of the high tech computer play would suffice but it just didn't. Now the thing I hated most was the lack of realism with the final battle, too ridiculous even for a Bond movie. Bond movies always have the international calvary riding in to help showing us that England is not alone in the battle against evil, I miss that. Lastly there was no Bond girl, the dumb Naoemi Harris and the beautiful, yet meaningless Berenice Marlohe could have been written out and no one would have noticed. A Bond girl has beautiful, charm, a story of her own and she lingers past the credits but these two are totally forgettable. Too bad I really wanted to like this movie a lot. I wanted it to be a 9 or 10. I gave it a 7 for Craig, Dench and Bardem. It might make a lot of money in the first week but it will take a big and final drop quickly. You know a movie should make you feel something so that you are talking about it afterward, the audience should be chattering while leaving the theater.

James Bond gets the creative refreshment he needs.,"*Possible Spoilers Ahead*007 has gone through quite a lot in his 50+ years of cinema; and Skyfall, believe it or not, is one of the all-time high points for the character. Skyfall actually shows Bond getting HURT, instead of being this invincible superman figure we're so used to seeing all the time and getting bored of. The scale of the adventure is big, memorable and very British (something you don't usually feel in modern blockbusters). Daniel Craig is very good here and it seems like this SHOULD have been his last Bond feature in his contract because Skyfall does have that 'penultimate' feel about it, something that predecessor Quantum of Solace lacked in nearly every way imaginable. I guess Skyfall got everything right considering this was released on Bond's 50th (cinematic) Anniversary, and what a birthday surprise this was for him indeed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
D for Disappointment,"I don't know if I can add anything more than what has been said on the previous 105 pages, but here goes: When I heard what a high-grossing movie this was, I thought, ""Great, they have moved beyond Quantum of Solace and emulated Casino Royale and other great Bond films."" My son saw it before me and said he only liked the last 1/3rd of the movie, the first 2/3rds was too slow and dull. That didn't stop me because I usually disagree with him, and I still do, but only because it seemed the whole movie was rather dull except the opening sequence. And the opening showing him shot, plunging down a waterfall left me wondering not just how he survived but why did he remain unavailable and not report back immediately? The film makes it look as though he would have been out of touch permanently except his conscience bothered him when he saw the attack on MI6 HQ. I can understand re-using some story lines but wasn't the rogue/traitor agent also used in QoS, the previous Bond film? In The World is Not Enough, M was also targeted, but when she was imprisoned she rigged a clock to a nuclear locating device to get help. That plot device works well for characters put in situations that they have no control over; however, in this film, why would Bond take M to a secluded house with no back-up of any kind, just jerry-rigged devices? Couldn't Q have given them some kind of assistance? These plot holes go on and on. Funny, though, I did not remember any plot holes in the previous two movies but this one is full of them and I was not amused. IMHO, this movie could make View to a Kill look good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
'Skyfall' is superb,"'Skyfall' is superb.Daniel Craig continues to shine as Bond, giving one of his best performances in the role here. He isn't my favourite James Bond lead, that doesn't mean he is anything less than impressive though.Javier Bardem is this film's main villain. I love what he brings to the table, he is outstanding as Silva. Naomie Harris is a welcomed addition, I would've liked to have seen her given more screen time in truth. Small shoutout to Ben Whishaw also, he makes for a very good Q.In terms of the plot, I think it is one of the best from the series so far. Although, I will say it wraps up pretty surprisingly - given what the entirety of the film spends doing beforehand. I still enjoyed it, mind.Not as terrific as Craig's debut in 'Casino Royale' or two other Bond productions, but this makes the upper echelons of my 007 ranking.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"Take all seriousness and gritty realism Casino Royale brought to the franchise and throw it out of the window, and you get Skyfall!","What's good about this film:Great Directing, Great Cinematography, Great Cast, Great Theme.What's bad about this film:Terrible writing with forced-jokes that takes out every inch of seriousness and realism established in Casino Royale. What made the humour so good in Casino Royale was that is was unexpected and minor, but when it came it was fantastic. Skyfall's first 45 minutes is almost entirely comedy and when a serious point in the film occurs, the comedy takes away all emotion from the scene.Feels like recession Bond (most of the film takes place indoors with extremely limited exotic locations).The gritty tone of Casino Royale is lost entirely in this film and feels more like one of the Pierce Brosnan/Roger Moore Bond movies.Bond's 50th anniversary made this film overly nostalgic and re-introduces Q, which from my point of view, was a bad idea and makes the film sillier. The reason Bond was reeboted was because it was becoming very formulaic and a parody of itself, sadly being the 50th anniversary the writers felt the need to re-introduce this awful material to make the film a 'classic' Bond.Because of the 50th anniversary the Aston Martin DB5 is present, which seems like a good idea, right? Yes but it was executed VERY badly, the DB5 has been given the gadgets from Goldfinger like built in machine guns, this doesn't make ANY sense in the Daniel Craig films as Q doesn't supply cars with guns and it feels like a forced nod to the previous movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Not The Best Bond Outing For Craig,"First thing's first...this is NOT a Casino Royale quality film. Plain and simple. Now that we have that out of the way, lets get on with the review. We see our beloved hero a few years after the events of Casino and Quantum, and he is obviously out of his element. Sure, its Craig back in the role, but its almost a different breed of 007. It starts off with the pedal to the floor, a huge opening sequence that leaves the audience wanting more. Whether it loves up to the watery mouths, that's up to the viewer. Story: The story is rather flat, and that is coming from a guy who never really says that. One scene, Bond is in this part of the world. The next, a completely different part, leaving me, at least, wondering, ""Um, did I miss something?"" Now don't mistake this as a negative review, because it surely is not. James Bond was kicking ass throughout, just as much of a bad ass that one would expect of Craig as 007 at this point. There were those spectacular action sequences that you just find yourself smiling at, whether you know it or not. Without giving much away, this is a rather generic plot. Bond returns, terrorist at large who happens to be MI6's most wanted, and insert twist and turn from there. It's a good story, but does it blow you away? Not by a long shot. Acting: Daniel Craig IS James Bond at this point, like it or not, ""Blonde-Bond haters."" He just flat out rocks as our secret agent hero. Every time he's on the screen, you can't help but want more and more of him, heterosexually. His performance as Bond NOT being recognized by the Academy is a BLASPHEMOUS ERROR by the Academy, especially after his THIRD Bond film. Judi Dench as the mother-like ""M"" is always as elegant and brooding, and in this installment there is no difference. She is just great. Ralph Fiennes (sp?) is the new guy this time around in MI6 and lives up to the expectations. He's just a master of the acting craft at this point, like it or not. Then, there's Javier Bardem as the menacing and, at times, overly awkward Silva, who is a bad guy but who has heart, as well. He's scary, funny, and dramatic all at once. Easily one of the best Bond villains of all time. Final Verdict: Sure, this didn't live up to Casino Royale, which was easily one of my favorite Bonds. Should you see it? Yes. Is it something to rush out and see? If you are a true, die-hard Bond fanatic then of course. If you wanna have a good time at the theater, then again, go see it. Just go in with an open mind, and let yourself be the judge. 7/10. Hopefully the next one is huge, much like I expected this ""action movie"" to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Great Movie. Perhaps the Best Bond Ever,"This is probably my favorite Bond movie ever. Although it occurred to me as I re-watched it, Bardem should've never been cast. They missed a perfect opportunity to cast Pierce Brosnan or even Timothy Dalton instead. Brosnan would've been perfect.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Skyfall? just a let down!,"I've never reviewed a film before. BUT 40 odd years ago I saved my pocket money to see Dr NO. Seen all the Jimmy Bondo's since and enjoyed all the incarnations.BUT NEVER BEFORE SO DISAPPOINTED! and until now I thought Daniel Craig was Bond embodied! He should be so sad!This was hyped as Bond back to moody and hard. BUT incredible action matched incredible plot!OK... with Bond some edge of the seat stuff is mandatory. But to 'bond' with BOND, the action must have some believability and complement a catchy Plot - here the action so obviously led the plot. The greatest depth came at the bottom of the opening action waterfall!Moody was me...dis-pleasured by a cartoon of a film heaving with risible moments and silly scripting.I finally gave up all tolerance of American driven drivel when Bond was offered his father's old 'hunting rifle' - unfortunately by an otherwise canny character - the old Scottish retainer. It was a shot gun....SHOT GUN! Rifles and shot guns are quite different things - a credible Bond would know this! AND in Scotland one either shoots or stalks - never HUNTS! (groan...head in hands....)And Skyfall? - that's a believable name for an old Scottish estate of course....?Sad old Bond... even leading ladies led nowhere.... As for the villain... what a paper character of convenience - which is where he should have been confined or flushed away and never trotted out.I only go to see 4-5 films a year - very selective. This is the first time ever I would have liked my money back - money back is unfortunately what the franchise guarantees Mendes - more mendicus for amends methinks than a Bond-myth master.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

50 years and counting,"In this 50th year of the James Bond series, with the dismal ""Quantum of Solace"" (2008) still in our minds, ""Skyfall"" triumphantly reinvents 007 in one of the best Bonds ever. This is a full-blooded, joyous, intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon, with Daniel Craig taking full possession of a role he earlier played well in ""Casino Royale,"" not so well in ""Quantum"" -- although it may not have been entirely his fault. Or is it just that he's growing on me? I don't know what I expected. I don't know what I expected in Bond No. 23, but certainly not an experience this invigorating. The movie's innovations begin in its first shots, which abandon the familiar stalking silhouettes in the iris lens, and hit the ground running. Bond and another agent are in Istanbul, chasing a man who has stolen a crucial hard drive, and after a chase through city streets (involving no less than three Fruit Cart Scenes), 007 is running on top of a train. We know from earlier films that Bond can operate almost anything, but ""Skyfall"" incredibly has him commandeer of a giant Caterpillar and continue the chase by crushing a flatcar filled with VW Beetles. M begins to compose the obituary of Commander James Bond, and she might as well also be writing her own. Time has passed her by, she's older, and her new boss, Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), convenes a public (!) hearing requiring her to defend her tenure. It's time for a generation to be put out to pasture. Even Q and, as it turns out, Miss Moneypenny are practically kids. This is a brand-new Bond with love and respect for the old Bond. This is dramatized during Bond's visit to the weathered Scottish mansion inhabited by Kincade (Albert Finney), which has secrets to divulge and continues the movie's rewriting of the character's back story. During the early Bonds, did we ever even ask ourselves about 007's origins in life? Just as Christopher Nolan gave rebirth to the Batman movies in ""The Dark Knight,"" here is James Bond lifted up, dusted off, set back on his feet and ready for another 50 years. And am I completely misguided when I expect to see Miss Moneypenny become a Bond girl in the next film? I'm double-posting my review of ""Skyfall"" to encourage comments, which my main site can't accept. JAMES BOND will return in Spectre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Adelle,"Holy cow, what a rollercoaster. Casino Royale is incredible, Quantum is meh and then right back up to amazing with Skyfall. The aging Bond slowly finding himself adrift in a world of cyber-intelligence that is leaving him behind. We get our new Q, who could cause more damage with a laptop in his pajamas than Bond could in a year. Bardem as an absolutely phenomenal, captivating villain. Dench knocking it out of the park as M once more. Brilliantly shot, gorgeous, amazing music.I really do love the way this poses the question of age v youth. Tradition v Innovation. The relationship between agent and commander. The history of Bond. It dives into so much and does it so well. I really struggle to decide whether Bardem or Mikkelsen as the best villain of this series. I think I want to give it to Bardem by the slightest edge but it's so close.I think the only thing holding this back for me, the one thing that keeps it from being as good as Casino, is the winking. There's just a touch too much self-referential, meta. The car, the gadgets, the quips, so many directed right at the old Bond standbys. One or two are fun, but this just goes a little further with it than I'd like. It's such a minor gripe, it really is, but it eventually got distracting and that was never a factor in Casino.Absolute recommend. Bardem alone is worth the watch in this, he is spectacular. This, suave yet playful and oddly sexual creature is utterly captivating every moment he's on screen. Wonderful movie, absolutely worth the time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best yet for Craig,"This was the best 007 to date for Daniel Craig. The action, visuals, acting, music etc were all in top form for this. Also, it was nice to see someone actually portray a bad character well in this as opposed to the last 2 movies. Great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Best Bond film by far!!,"Having putting off watching this for so long, I can't stress enough how impressed I am with this installment in the James Bond franchise. Daniel Craig lends a humanity to the character no other actor has been able to do. The wittiness of notably Sean Connery and Roger Moore made way for a much more serious approach to the character. (Note that Connery and Moore were very good being witty and I'm not criticizing them. I just enjoyed the seriousness more).This is an incredibly classy action thriller with great cinematography. The film has some impressive action scenes, and great dialogue, too. Yes, there are the cliches of fleeing on the rooftops and fighting on a moving train, but this film takes it a few notches higher). I did find the film's running time unnecessarily long with some scenes dragging the film down. Cutting some of these scenes would drastically have improved the pacing. The film features some amazingly stunning visuals not seen before in any Bond film.Javier Bardem was exceptionally good as the antagonist, probably the most charming and different Bond villain yet. It was quite refreshing , actually. Judi Dench was very good as always, and Daniel Craig is just so damn SEXY it was an utter delight watching him. Daniel has a great body and they find perfect excuses to utilize this. I'm certainly not complaining.The last half of the film was almost too good to be a James Bond film. It was filled with more depth and emotion than any previous (Bond) film, and was actually quite suspenseful. The visuals during the Skyfall raid scenes are STUNNING!!! This is by far the best and most enjoyable 007 film yet! The film bears none of the trademarks of the previous films - Bond didn't even have a Martini!!'Skyfall' won 2 Oscars, with another 65 wins and further 120 nominations, which I believe to be the most awarded James Bond film ever. Well done, Sam Mendes!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond is back in complete style,"Rating-8/10Skyfall is Bond movie that not only boasts fantastic action and adventure, but some thoroughly great acting as well. With explosions galore and a plot also deeply explored within, you can't help feel after watching why critics so loved this movie. It could be said it is slightly overrated but I'll get to that, It was firmly an impressive film and here below is why.The story is big, and by that I mean epic with it's more exciting scenes merging well with the more dramatic scenes to create one film that not only epitomises Bond but also the entire spy genre thriller. It really does start to get fast toward the end and any resentment against the film for being too slow at the start need only be temporary as James really kicks into action and manages to also not go over the top on the 50 year anniversary clichés.Daniel Craig performs well yet again as Bond and although in Quantum his performance was overshadowed by a negative reviewed film, he really brings a much more dark yet emotional portrayal of Bond, far beyond just the cars and guns. What can I say about Javier Bardem other than that man runs this film, his portrayal of Silva is one of the best among Bond characters and he beautifully masters the role that only someone like him can. Cast members such as Judi Dench, Ralph Fiennes and Naomie Harris bring this movie to be one the best acted ever in the franchise and all credit to the producers.Sam Mendes directs well yet it can slightly seem like he does slow it down just a little when it ought not to, no real complaint though as he does a great job in the end. The writers really excel here and Neil Purvis, Robert Wade etc do a job that is not easy, make Bond actually smartly written. The cinematography and the stunts are beautifully done and they all really come together including the effects to make one memorably looking Bond film, just adds to the excitement.My critical eye you may think would be over my perceived slow start to the movie but in truth the only criticism I can think of is slightly well, silly parts. There are scenes which just don't need to be done and add too much extra time to the movie, I think they wanted an all round blockbuster but some parts make it seem like a slow moving drama film, manages to just wriggle out by the end.If you love Bond then this won't go a miss, it stacks up completely to the very best and should really please anyone who enjoys Bond or even dislikes Craig. I think if you are looking for action after action then this probably isn't exactly for you as it just doesn't contain that and although some parts can seem slightly like that, it still has that dramatic edge that some movies really seem to lack.Overall a fine movie and for me ranks right at the top near abouts in a Bond ranking list. Celebrate Bond and this should be looked back on just as we look back on Goldfinger which Is usually considered the very best. I will also add that if you want to see an acting ensemble do well then look no further than this one, just magnificent and a truly remarkable set of cast.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Loses steam towards the end,"Starts off great like most Bond films. The pulsating and adrenaline rush inducing opening sequence sets the tone for the rest of the film. However, the rest of the film fails to keep up. The pacing of the movie is erratic, perhaps deliberately so but it didn't work for me. Having said that, this movie has more humor than the previous Craig- Bond ventures though the dark overtones prevail through out the film. Craig continues to give Bond the rough edge but one sorely misses the humor and the witty one liners. They are there as mentioned earlier but are few and far between. Javier Bardem makes for a decent villain though his character derives obvious inspiration from Dark Knight's Joker. Judi Dench, Naomie Harris and Ralph Fiennes are adequate in their parts. The movie is expectedly a visual extravaganza as it moves from turkey to London and then to shanghai and macau.Has most of the Bond elements like Q's gadgets, shaken martinis & fancy casinos (with komodos) in small measures which makes it a mildly entertaining ride. Expected more, especially with Sam Mendes at the helm.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Great Bond Film,"With No Time To Die upon us, I just have to finish off my Daniel Craig review series and that continues here with Skyfall. The premise of the film sees Bond go after a man linked to M's past that threatens all of MI6.Main Character
Daniel Craig is obviously playing James Bond here and he is fantastic. This is an older and more experienced Bond in this film and Craig sells it really well, it feels like at this point that he can play the role in his sleep and the more dramatic and emotional pressures put onto him are done effectively.Supporting Characters
Judi Dench is back as M and this is possibly the largest role she has ever been given in a Bond film and she is fantastic. You see how the role is starting to get on top of her and how the tough calls she has had to make in the past and she really does an excellent job of developing this character here. Javier Bardem plays the villain and this is a truly memorable villain, his entrance in this film is a scene that sends chills. The film takes a while to introduce him but when it does it makes him a villain that you will not forget in a hurry. Naomie Harris joins as an ally to Bond and she is a really fun addition to the franchise just as Ben Whishaw is as the new Q and there dynamics with Craig are some of the highlights of the film. Ralph Fiennes is good in the film, his role isn't too meaty but he does what he can and is another great cog to this great cast.Story
The film 's story is effective when it is looking at the characters and there depth, the relationship between Bond and M is really put in the forefront and it is done so well that it just adds another dynamic to this franchise. But this film does have a slight issue that its plot is a bit muddled, Bardem doesn't appear on screen for so long that it takes away from the tasks that Bond is doing and makes it feel like the plot could have been trimmed down a bit for a more effective time.Script
The script is really good here, the dialogue is quick and witty but serious and heartfelt. It manages to blend these two in a way that it makes these characters stand out and feel much more human and relatable then they might have been without it.Style
The action scenes are fantastic, the opening 10 mins alone are some of the best action scenes you will see in an action film. It feels really impactful and the creative fighting techniques and stunts done is a real credit to the actors and crew. But the film is just too long, there is easily 10 to 15 mins that could have been cut and it would have been more effective especially when it comes to its pacing which doesn't always stand up.Overall
Overall, Skyfall is a great Bond Film. It has action, drama and good characters and feels like a real return to form for Craig's Bond.Rating - 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Slick. Good Production Value. Good Acting. Uninteresting Plot!,"Finally got a chance to watch the latest Bond Movie. This is definitely a better Bond movie after the Debacle of ""Quantum of Solace"". However it seems they have not spend much time on the story-line and the plot for Skyfall. If you are expecting the brilliance of ""Casino Royale"" from ""Skyfall"" then you would be as disappointed as I am.The opening sequence is good and sets a good tone. However, somewhere in the middle I lost the interest. The movie is a tad too long... better editing would have helped. I found the plot rather uninteresting and meaningless; and you can easily find a lot of loop-holes in the story.Daniel Craig is good, Judi Dench looked out of sorts and Javier Bardem is almost wasted.

"The second best Bond film, just behind Casino Royale","Skyfall is one of the best Bond movies ever made, some might even say the best. For me, it's a close second to Casino Royale. Skyfall has all of the traits that is needed for a Bond good film. Great action, an evil villain, attractive women, and of course, Bond. I would say Skyfall's action is just as good as Casino Royale's, maybe even better. Skyfall has more action than Casino Royale, but Casino Royale has more iconic action scenes. What I think Skyfall does the best in the Bond franchise is the cinematography. Skyfall is a beautiful movie. Peak cinematography was in the Shanghai portion, which had vibrant colors and great lighting.The Villain of Skyfall, Silva, played by Javier Bardem, is great; I would say the best in the franchise. The dialogue is great and the line delivery by Bardem is amazing. He's intimidating and clever, and that's pretty much all you need for a great Bond Villain. In general, the screenplay and directing is just top notch in Skyfall; if Sam Mendes couldn't do it, then no one can.Skyfall is a solid 8/10.

I'm sure there are other multiple weapons that have more than a one shot capability.. As the bad guy was riding on top of the train for a substantial amount of time after Bond took the hit.

May the heavens fall,"""Skyfall"" has already become the twenty-third project about James Bond in the famous series and the third picture, where the role of an English scout is played by the memorable and charismatic Daniel Craig. The new story was timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the start of the now famous franchise. The scope of the picture and its sincerity allowed the project to reach a new level, giving the audience one of the most interesting stories about Agent 007.The story continues. Bond and the entire organization are confronted by one of the most memorable antagonists of the entire Bond, played by the inimitable Javier Bardem. His villain Silva is an extraordinary person. A professional, a dangerous strategist who thinks through all his steps in advance, he seeks to finally meet his mentor M, who, as in previous projects, was played by an excellent actress Judi Dench. Her role in this picture has been significantly expanded, making the heroine literally one of the most important links of the entire secret system that she heads and which Silva now seeks to destroy.The picture is good. The production is habitually atmospheric and memorable. New chases, shootouts, explosions and fights - all this does not give secondary and at the same time resembles the corporate style of the James Bond project.However, the picture tends to be a thriller rather than a familiar action movie. This project is clearly different from the two previous paintings with Craig. Here, Bond himself is revealed to us much more. He's not the same as before. Years of service have worn out a man, turned him into an agent who has served his time, who with the last of his strength grabs the last opportunity to remain in the service, although he copes badly with the standards for an agent. In this film, we see how he struggles with the advent of modernity, where, as stated, muscle and shooting issues are no longer solved. But as the further development of the plot will show, Bond is still needed, he is still relevant.There are a lot more dialogues in the film. Meaningful dialogues. Shifting the narrative in this direction allows you to enjoy a new transformation of Bond, but even more interesting is his relationship with M. Finally, the characters get closer, begin to trust each other, and the woman, it seems to me, becomes a kind of unnamed mother for James. The fragile bond formed between the characters will become the soul of this project and will last until the very end of the picture.All this becomes possible thanks to the antagonist Silva, who acts as the antipode of Bond. An unsuccessful experiment by M, who, being a masterful agent, left his business, betraying the organization, and now aspiring to show everyone, including Bond, how M deceives everyone around. Is she cheating? Silva sees the world in his own way. Bardem is very good in this image: extravagant, unique, eccentric and definitely memorable. He is calculating and cunning, thinks through his moves in advance, acts as a worthy rival of James Bond. That's why it is remembered. There is no habitual pattern and pathos in it. This villain is well-written and designed to make the lives of Bond and M a real hell.The picture undertakes to reveal the past of James Bond, allowing the audience to look into the life of a British agent. But not for long. The main thing is the plot that leads us to Skyfall, Bond's ancestral estate, where all the significant events of this picture will take place.The project finally introduces beloved and familiar characters from previous paintings, including Manipeni and Q. New faces on the screen - the corresponding actors Naomi Harris and Ben Whishaw showed themselves perfectly, giving unforgettable and so necessary images in Bond.A great addition to the picture was the musical work of singer Adele, who gave the world the song ""Skyfall"". The film won an Oscar for this titular composition, also taking the statuette for the Best Sound Editing.""Skyfall"" came out good. The picture is long enough, but not so long as to have time to get bored. The narration allows you to plunge into the most interesting confrontation of rivals, delve into the inner world of Bond, see from a different angle M. The picture is good and atmospheric.

A solid Bond,"Another great Bond movie with tension, action and a really good villain. Craig is solid again and he's well supported by the rest of the cast. Oh and add to that one of the best Bond songs ever by Adele.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
