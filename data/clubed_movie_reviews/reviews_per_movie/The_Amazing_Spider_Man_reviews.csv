The Spider-man Film That The Comic Fans Will Love But Sam Raimi Fans Will Hate,"Being a Spider-man comic book fan I can say that a lot of the stuff that happens in this story is true to the comic book Spider-man. Spider-man has web shooters, Spider-man likes to joke a lot, Gwen Stacy was Spider-man's first love, etc. So Anyone who is a fan of the comics will respect this movie on that merit, the merit that it was faithful to the source material while bringing in new stuff without losing what made Spider-man who he is.People who've only seen the Spider-man films and never bothered to read any of the comics. Won't like this film as much. They'll say the same old stuff. ""Why was this made? We've seen this already?"" Blah blah blah.Let me go off saying that behind Spider-man 2, this is probably the best of the Spider-man trilogy for one reason.....it avoids all clichés that the original trilogy didn't. In fact the film pretty much avoids all clichés at all. I'll try and explain a few without spoiling the film.Well first of all the woman in this film aren't morons. One of the main problems I had with Sam Raimi's films was the fact that all woman were pretty much portrayed as objects that Spider-man can save. None of them do anything helpful. Sure Mary Jane tried to hit Doctor Octopus with a plank in the second film, but she couldn't even do that right. That's not the case here. Gwen actually has a confrontation with with villain and she doesn't screw around, I won't say what she does but when I saw it happen I couldn't help but cheer. Finally a Spider-man film where the woman have a brain-stem.The second cliché it avoids is being predictable. The original films basically have Spider-man going through the motions. Girl gets kidnapped, Spidey saves girl, Spidey defeats villain or jumps out of the way so the villain can do harm to himself. That is not the case with this film, a lot of the time you think one thing is going to happen but then it doesn't and the opposite happens.The third cliché it avoids is having silly moments. The first trilogy had a lot of them, yes even Spider-man 2 (The raindrops keep falling on my head scene). Going back an having re-watched the Sam Raimi trilogy before seeing this one, the films are more like popcorn films. Sam Raimi is the master at making B movies and that's what the original trilogy was, an epic scale B Movie. With this film, they get a little more serious. There's not really any goofy moments that I can think of and if there are then it's usually played for laughs.Also THANK GOD They got Flash Thompson right. Sam Raimi used Flash so he could be the stereotypical bully, and at the beginning you think that's what Marc Webb plans to do, but then he shows that Flash isn't as big a douche as he makes himself out to be. Flash is one of my favourite Spider-man characters in the comics, and I'd like to say ""thank you Marc Webb for avoiding the cliché of him just being a bully and actually making him a human being with depth."" The film also does other things right besides avoiding clichés. The actors all do fantastic jobs and I will go on record saying that Andrew Garfield is the perfect Spider-man and a great role model for young boys even though he has his flaws. Martin Sheen was great as an Uncle Ben who is kind, understanding, but at the same time doesn't take any crap. Emma Stone was great as the kind of jokey but intelligent Gwen Stacy who is a strong positive role model for young woman. The Guy who played the villain was great, The girl who played Aunt May was good in the few scenes she was in. Not a weak link in the bunch.So I've done nothing but praise this film so far, so why is it still behind Spider-man 2 in my books? Well the film does have flaw, mainly two. One it's rushed, the only one who really pays for it being rushed is the villain who only gets one line of dialogue to explain his motives and even then we're not sure why he's doing that. The second flaw is that it doesn't have this big epic feel that Spider-man 2 had, it doesn't feel like it was made to be a big summer blockbuster, instead it was made to be an Indy film with a big budget....although maybe that's why I liked it so much, it focuses more on characters than action.....hurm.....I'm still on the fence with that last one.The Amazing Spider-man is a good film. It avoids most if not all clichés, it's fresh, it's interesting, it's got characters you love to see and actually feel for played by fantastic actors, it's a great Spider-man film and it's sad that a lot of fans seem to be hating it right now. I honestly can't see what's to hate.Good film, go see it.....oh by the way.....I wouldn't recommend seeing it in 3D, there are a few moments where you're like ""Whoa cool"" but not much.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nothing special really,"The Amazing Spider-Man is supposed to be a reboot of the Spider-Man movie franchise. Tobey Maguire is replaced by Andrew Garfield in the protagonist role of Peter Parker. His main love interest switches from Mary-Jane Watson to Gwen Stacy, and the villain in this installment is Dr Curt Connors aka Lizard. As expected, this reboot goes back to the beginning when Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man only it is told in a rather different way to the 2002 movie. This time they also try to add a bit more character oriented storyline.Is it a good movie? Yes, particularly since I saw this movie in IMAX. This made the action scenes more exciting to watch. It also uses a villain that hasn't been used in the previous movies so at least it does make it different from the previous movies.Is it a successful reboot of the franchise? In my opinion, not really. It's been five years since the last Spider-Man movie came out, and ten years since the movie franchise was first introduced. Even when they made the announcement of this movie being made, I was questioning it because it's just too soon to make a reboot. For the same reason, this reboot is not refreshing. Without trying to give anything away, you can recognise that this movie takes some of the elements from the 2002 movie. The character oriented storyline doesn't add that much meat to the character of Peter Parker as its supposed to. Its easier to count this as another installment only with different actors playing the roles.I really enjoyed the first three Spider-Man movies, and yes that includes Spider-Man 3. This new Spider-Man movie is also enjoyable but it fails to refresh the series. It seems that I was right in thinking that its too soon to do so.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as bad as everyone says it is,"So when I watched this movie for the first time (way after it had come out), I was under the impression that it was a pretty forgettable movie by the Marvel fandom and I just needed to watch it so I could understand what would happen in No Way Home. So I have it watch.Honestly, it was better than what I thought it was, but definitely one of the weaker Spider-Man movies. There are things that don't work in this movie - personally, Peter Parker as a skate kid didn't do it for me, a couple unsolved plots, and Uncle Ben (where was the famous line??) but there were good things tooThe action and design of this movie was phenomenal. The swinging action is still the only movie that fully captures the agility of Spider-Man (the newer MCU ones don't really have these action shots) and the fight scenes are so cleverly made. Andrew Garfield got the Spider-Man half right - he captured the clever and witty personality of Spider-Man better than Maguire did. The second thing, really what stood out about this movie is the chemistry between Gwen and Parker. Something about their relationship connected and really made me think they were destined to be together. It's better than any other marvel ship that comes to my mind and thus just made the ending so satisfying for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I really don't get all the hate!,"I admit that I too didn't exactly get that excited when I heard that this was in the making. The Sam Raimi trilogy was a fun ride, and the idea of making another Spider-Man movie with a completely new cast seemed strange and unnecessary. When the cast was announced, I got a little bit curious, but nothing more.However, when I watched it, I got a whole other impression. I really liked it. The atmosphere was great, and perhaps a little darker than the Sam Raimi movies at times. I know many of you who read this will hate me for saying this, but I actually think this movie was a LITTLE bit better that the previous ones. Not much, but just a hint better. One thing is the cast. I really didn't like Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man that much. I didn't have a huge problem with him back then, but now when I saw this, I must say that I like Andrew Garfields ""version"" better. He's a little more tougher, both physically and in personality. Also, I think Emma Stone did good as Gwen Stacy. I liked her better as Peter Parker's girlfriend than Kirsten Dunst. The Villain, too, was great. I won't say more about him, not wanting to spoil anything.When I read many of the reviews in here, I don't see much positivity about this movie. I think that's unfair. At least, it's mediocre. Giving this a 1/10 is criminally wrong. At least I think so. If you wonder if you should see this or not, at least give it a chance. Don't let the bad reviews scare you away.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best adaptations.,"Having realized I'm a sucker for all these comic book adaptations, of course I had to see this one as well. I never did like the earlier Spiderman movies, being the main role or the supporting ones, I'm not sure; but they still stand among the movies I'm not eager to watch again. But this one, on the contrary, was actually quite entertaining. Not was it only packed with really great CGI, but it had a great flow built up on both action, drama, romance and humor.At least for me this is what makes a good movie. I never once thought ""Oh, my goodness that was lame"" (which I often actually do), instead I was rather surprised I was laughing out loud in more than one of the scenes.All the actors did a MARVELous job, meaning all the jokes, the depth of the drama, and the sincerity of both the romance and the action stood solid throughout the movie. Speaking of the actors: the casting was brilliant. All of the main actors (and I guess most of the supporting ones) was perfect for their roles, and must have made the script it self proud.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Predictability, uninteresting action sequences, and an awful soundtrack keep this film from being on par or even setting its self apart from the previous decade's Spiderman.","First off, this is only my opinion, but really my biggest issue with this film was that it was just kinda boring. About 30 minutes in, I already knew fundamentally everything significant that would transpire in the film. Now that in itself might be a given some might argue, however at that point in the movie, I assumed I would still enjoy it as I expected some spectacular action. Had I been impressed with the fight scenes and jumping around being Spiderman I don't think I would have cared as much about the boring story because it would be redeemed in another aspect.However, the action and special effects in the film were also...kinda...boring. In fact the most spectacular visual moment in the entire film where Spiderman jumps of the top of the tower antenna, and it falls with him as he saves himself was already shown to us in the trailer. I won't go into the fight sequences but for me there was just never really a moment that made my heart race.Lastly the soundtrack was terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrible, feeling very out of place in many parts, most notably the fight between the Lizard and Spiderman in the High School. I would normally assume in a scene like that, which is Spiderman and the Lizard's first real physical confrontation, for the music to be more menacing, however it opts for a very happy and victorious theme music. Considering Spiderman doesn't exactly whoop the Lizard there, it's a little out of place. There is however a memorable humorous scene in that altercation.So...this is just kinda boring and not very exiting, as far as movies like this, I personally enjoyed more ""The A Team"",""Red"",""The Avengers"",""Thor"", the first two Spidermans, (Spiderman 3 was terrrrrrible).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Amazingly Unnecessary Spider-man,"With the success of the first X-Men movie in 2000, Bryan Singer pretty much paved the way for all the comic book movies we see today. That included a certain super hero movie made by Sami Rami in 2002 where a nerdy guy (Tobey Maguire) gets bitten by a radioactive spider and inherits superhuman powers. If Singer had paved the way, then Rami provided the icing on the cake: a faithful, smart, well-acted super hero flick that had as much heart and sincerity packed in as it had all those set pieces. It also lead to a superior sequel and the much maligned, though underrated, third episode.Which brings us to what we have here: while not a beat for beat remake, you get the same story more or less with a different love interest and villain. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) sneaks into a research facility and gets bitten by a radioactive/genetically enhanced spider. He gets super powers and becomes Spider-Man. Meanwhile, a doctor (Rhys Ifans) working at the same facility, is being forced to close down his research into tissue regeneration. In desperation, he injects himself with an untested self-generating lizard vaccine and becomes a half man/half lizard thing. Spider-Man is then forced into action to stop him from spreading this contagion throughout the city of New York. Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) is the damsel in distress/love interest and plays a role in trying to stop the crazed beast.First things first: this is not a bad film. It's well acted by all the principals, has good effects, a scary and menacing villain, some nice action sequences and web swinging effects that are generally slightly more realistic than the Rami version. Parker is more evidently scientific and intelligent here. Also the police's notion that Spider-Man is a menace to the public is more clearly defined, especially in the scene where he disarms an officer. The new idea is that Parker can hear the movements of spiders and it's a good addition. So where does it all go wrong? The short answer: it's just that it's so pointless.We had already seen the story before. There was absolutely no reason to tell it again. This movie could easily have been Spider-Man 4 with Andrew Garfield filling in the Spidey spandex instead of Tobey Maguire. But Marvel – in their infinite wisdom – just chose to tell the same story a second time. Going by that rationale, presumably Andrew Garfield will be cast aside like a disused sock when they inevitably choose to 'reboot' the franchise again in ten years or so. It is a scarily unimaginative tactic and it is one they will continue to do until there is a massive financial failure.This movie follows the same set up as the 2002 version: Parker being picked on, getting advice from his sage-like uncle (Martin Sheen), being bitten, getting his powers/climbing walls, and turning his back on a situation which unfortunately has tragic consequences for a family member. It's all a case of been there, done that. If you want to compare it to the Rami original, then the short answer is; as good as Andrew Garfield is, Tobey Maguire was better. Maguire filled the suit better; on occasion, Garfield is prone to looking thin and scrawny during several scenes. Even the suit looked better in the Rami movies. And those earlier movies had a heart and sincerity – especially in the relationship between Peter and his aunt and uncle that you don't see here. Again we ask: why does this movie exist?And there are holes: there's a massive lizard running around, wreaking havoc; yet the police are more preoccupied with pointing their guns at Spider-Man – despite the fact that he saved a child in a (surprise, surprise) rehashed scene set on a bridge taken from Rami's first movie. In another part, the citizens of the city (once again - in a bit taken from Rami's movie) unite to help Spider-Man cross the city using tower cranes – despite the fact that there are buildings all around him. Heck, even the villain is initially a do-gooder like Norman Osborn and Dr. Octavius – again from the Rami movies.It also seems to pull inspiration from another super hero movie: Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005) in that it's slightly darker, tells such a large origin story that just like Batman Begins, Spider-Man doesn't actually show up on screen for the first hour. So if you take two parts Batman Begins and add a touch of Rami's Spider-Man, the result is what you have here. Additionally, the introduction of the web shooters, while being faithful to the original comics and emphasizing Parker's intellect, is a bit of a mixed blessing. The notion of the web being an organic material rather than being fired from mechanical devices actually made more sense.It's not that reboots are a bad idea, they're not. In certain situations they can work well, provided for example, enough time has elapsed. But there is no point in retelling the same story if the initial release is still relatively recent. In addition, it helps if the story wasn't covered well the first time, or it was a bad movie to begin with. Going by this criteria, Marvel's latest cash cow is unnecessary on all three accounts.In closing, if you haven't already seen the Rami movie from 2002, go watch it instead. If you have seen it, then this probably won't live up to it and you will be left feeling a little underwhelmed. It's fair to say that for anyone over the age of eighteen, this movie will seem rather half-hearted and senseless; for those under eighteen, this movie will probably be the greatest super hero flick ever. Yes, it's a movie that will divide opinions, primarily on the sole reason for its existence. Not a bad, or a badly made flick, by any means just a pointless one.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Fresh New Start,"Spider-Man is my favorite super-hero of all time. I've read the comics (mostly the Ultimate comics, but some of the 60's comics as well), played some of the video games, and watched the cartoons (The 1994 and 2008 series being some of my favorite animated shows of all time).I enjoyed Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (yes, even Spider-Man 3). When I heard that the series was being rebooted, I wasn't happy to hear about it. My expectations were neutral as time went by and when I walked out the theater, my expectations were blown away.I don't want to compare this movie to the original trilogy, but I think it's necessary to see where this movie improved from the originals.Let's start with the casting. Andrew Garfield is a great successor to Tobey Maguire. I can really relate to him like I always do with other incarnations of the web slinger. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is even better than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. Gwen is a much stronger character and the chemistry between her and Garfield as Peter Parker is believable. Rhys Ifans is great as Doctor Connors (a.k.a. The Lizard) and I like how he is a ""Jekyll and Hyde""-type of villain (kind of like a few other villains... yeah). Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, respectively, are also great as well. All the characters are portrayed very well and are believable.The visual effects and the action scenes are good as usual, but nothing new.The musical score by James Horner is also great, although I prefer Danny Elfman's score in the original trilogy because they felt more memorable and left a lasting impression. But, who knows? James Horner's score may grow on me over time.If I have to name some complaints, it would have to be that some parts were rushed (although it's a minor nitpick) as well as a couple of parts not evaluated much. I think an extended cut of the movie would be necessary when it's released on DVD, but that's just me.Overall, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a fresh new start on the franchise. It has superb acting, thrilling action scenes (especially the climax), an amazing score, and being faithful to the comics but at the same time taking liberties to make it more interesting. Best Spidey movie ever? It's too early to tell but maybe. It's definitely worth watching and I am looking forward to the sequel.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Had this come out 10 or 15 years ago, I would have loved it...","I can't take credit for the summary--my oldest daughter said that when we left the theater after seeing ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". That's because with all the many, many super-hero movies out in recent years, this one loses a bit of something--especially since there are clearly better films of its genre (such as ""Iron Man"" and ""The Avengers""). It's decent but there are better products out there.First, let's talk about what I loved. The CGI was incredible and for the first time it really looks like Spider-Man is flying. It's very seamless and looks brilliant. Also, the Spider-Man costume and movements are all great.What I thought was lacking in the film. It's ALL CGI and special effects--and nothing much more. The characters and dialog just didn't seem all that important. And because of this, it's spectacular to watch but nothing more....nothing. And, while I think about it, why, oh why didn't they include THE most important line in any Spider-Man film--Uncle Ben's line ""With great power comes great responsibility""?! It is the perfect summation of who the character is and according to Stan Lee it is Spider-Man...so why is it missing?!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""The good effort but not amazing spiderman""","To start off I want to say I enjoyed this movie but even as I type that I do question exactly how much.People have talked about the CGI not being up to scratch and parts of the 3D being blurry but I don't think that was the problem. The action was great, the characters were good but it seemed to be one ""amazing"" set piece scene after another with very little connecting them. I often found myself wondering what happened to get from point A to C, B seems to happen off screen for a large portion of the film.I know the words ""gritty"" and ""dark"" seem to crop up every time someone talks about a good superhero film but I don't think that needs to be the case, I like superhero films to be larger than life – that's kind of the point! For the inevitable comparison with the Sam Raimi spiderman film, I would say it is more gritty, a little darker, slightly less fun and a lot less coherent.An overall enjoyable watch but not sure ""amazing"" should have been in the title.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The 'BATMAN BEGINS' of Spider-Man films, I'd go as far as to say it's amazing!","'THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN': Five Stars (Out of Five)The 'BATMAN BEGINS' of Spider-Man films, this reboot to Sam Raimi's blockbuster trilogy doesn't disappoint and I'd go as far as to say it's amazing! Director Marc Webb (who made his debut with 2009's critically acclaimed hit '(500) DAYS OF SUMMER') takes over the franchise with Andrew Garfield (of 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' fame) replacing Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man. The film was written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent (who also co-wrote 'SPIDER-MAN 2' and '3') and Steve Kloves (who wrote every 'HARRY POTTER' film). This film focuses entirely on Peter's high school years while he learns to first develop his powers as well as cope with the disappearance of his parents and who his father really was (unlike the original Sam Raimi film). It's also a little more faithful to the comic, in some ways, by having Parker develop artificial web-shooters that he uses to swing around on, rather than being able to produce them physically as part of his super powers. It also goes back to having Gwen Stacy (his original love interest from the comics) as the object of his affection rather than Mary Jane (like the Raimi films). Gwen is played beautifully by 'it girl' Emma Stone (the object of Jim Carrey's obsession). The movie, despite treading on some old ground, is thoroughly entertaining and powerfully well made.This story begins with Peter as a young boy (Max Charles) being left in the care of his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) by his parents (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz), who disappear without ever being heard from again. Peter grows up to be a somewhat awkward teen (Garfield, who's way too old to play a teen) but is much cooler than Parker probably should be; he rides a skateboard and actually flirts (successfully) with his high school crush Gwen Stacy (Stone). One day he finds his father's old briefcase which leads him to seek out his father's old associate, a scientist by the name of Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans). Gwen actually works at Oscorp with Connors, which is where Parker stumbles into a lab experimenting on genetically modified spiders and is bit by one. He of course develops spider like powers and when his Uncle is killed makes it his mission to fight crime and get revenge. In this film he must deal with Dr. Connors' alter ego, the genetically mutated monster 'The Lizard' (which is the first time the classic Spider-Man villain has graced the silver screen), as well as the police, lead by Gwen's father Captain Stacy (Denis Leary).The movie does go over a lot of the same plot points as the original Sam Raimi hit but it delves a little more deeper in to them. I thought the first two 'SPIDER-MAN' films had a great amount of emotional drama and character development (which is why they're two of my favorite films) but this installment manages to outdo them. It really gets in to the character of Peter Parker, on a relatable level to almost every high school nerd (present or past) and Garfield plays him amazingly. I thought Maguire was about as good a Spider-Man as they could have casted but somehow Garfield manages to outdo him, mostly with passion for the role (he says he cried the first time he put on the costume). Stone is a little cuter and more adorable than Kirsten Dunst, I wouldn't say she's a better actress but it's definitely easier to fall for her character than Mary Jane's (due to Stone's likability). Sheen and Field are classic like always and Ifans makes a memorable insane villain. The acting is definitely a little better in this film but the script is also smarter and more complex and Webb's direction is impressively fitting. I wouldn't say he's as good a director as Sam Raimi but it's nice to see a different take on the series. Besides all the material that's already been done there's definitely enough new stuff to make the film interesting and thrilling. I'd say it's a better reboot film than 'BATMAN BEGINS' even, it's no 'THE DARK KNIGHT' but it is better than Nolan's original Batman film. If you're a fan of the series or the character (and Spider-Man is my favorite superhero) you're sure to be thrilled.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhcS7Q-CkYE",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Meh at best.,This reboot had a different feel then the other spiderman movies. The reason being is that this reboot felt more directed towards adults. This is not to say its not appropriate for younger viewers because its perfectly fine for most youngsters. This spiderman has very little scenes that grab at children rather more of a straight action film with no comedy. Spiderman was much closer to the original hero in this film and i can and did really appreciate that. I found that spiderman 4 would have probably done just as well as The Amazing Spiderman. The movie seemed to drag on much longer then needed with a very slow start. I think the only real thing that would appeal to people is that spiderman is not played by Tobey Maguire which in itself is worth at least a watch.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Amazing Spiderman is amazing.,"When i first saw the trailer of this movie last year, i thought- another Spiderman movie?, and again earlier this year- seriously, another Spiderman move?. In all honesty, i was not compelled to watch the movie- may be it was the trailer or that thought of how far can a Spiderman movie be different than the one produced about a decade ago? How 'amazing' can it be, as its title suggests?After going against the odds, i came out from the movie very pleased. In fact, i enjoyed the move thoroughly and felt very entertained. And i finally understood the word 'amazing' in the title- because it is really, pretty amazing!It is not one of those movies with excessive ZOMG factor, for sure. The movie is amazingly captured with great use of CGI. The first half of the movie explores the dark side of Peter Parker's family history in a fairly comical manner. I got to know about Peter's father, which was not much explained in the previous trilogy and i don't exactly read the comics.Then there is his high school stories of his love. The next half of the movie was gripping and fast-paced, with well angled shots to make you feel like swinging from building to building and climbing up towers- i watched it in 2D and i could still feel the height! This part of the movie focuses on the transformation of Dr Connors as the Lizard, the villain of this movie, who happens to be Peter's father's working partner. His wish to regenerate his arm goes awry, leading him to produce a biological threat that forces Spiderman to a race to save the people in the city.As i said, i was entertained. The movie was light hearted, like watching The Captain America, with brilliant cast. Andrew G performs magnificently as Peter Parker, to a certain extent, i felt him outshine Tobey M. He fits the character well. I enjoyed the scene where he first discovers of his special ability, particularly with the flipping of his skateboard. Much credits to Emma Stone, Sally Field, Martin Sheen and Rhys I, and director Marc Webb for taking the risk of rebooting this franchise. Watch out for Stan Lee in a show-stopper scene. Flash, played by Chris, gives me the feeling of a sequel where he will be featured in a bigger role- like Jacob in Twilight.Give this Spiderman a try. For a two-hour movie, this movie does not fall short and does not feel long. And a sequel is pretty likely- stay for the post-credit (duh! almost all Marvel movies has this).I have to say this one more time: The Amazing Spiderman is amazing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not so amazing spiderman,"Even though many reviewers are calling this as improvement over Spiderman 1 but I think otherwise. First of the franchise would have done better to make a sequel instead of rebooting everything - with new actors. Since spiderman 3 did not live upto expectations, people started criticizing both Toby & Kirsten. I think they did a pretty good job (even part 3 was not awfully bad). But rebooting doesn't make sense. That too, only after 10yrs. They should have waited another 25-30 yrs for that.Also they should have taken some lessons from the way X-men & Batman franchises have gone. Batman (1989) was possibly the only good movie in batman series and there was plenty of scope for improvement. That's what they did, starting with Batman Begins, Dark Knight & D K Rises (pretty sure it's going to be bigger than Amazing Spiderman, possibly overtake even Avengers). Stronger plot, better acting, better direction, dialogues, action sequences, CGI effects etc. They took it to a whole new level. In case of X-men, they started pretty well with X-men 1,2 but had couple of blunders in between. But they corrected it X-men first class. My first X-men movie was X-men FC which was very likable that I watched all the other ones too. But the need for a prequel of X-men was there. Since Charles Xavier and Magneto had worked together as shown in earlier movies. Spiderman 1 already had almost everything (may be a bit rushed though but so is Amazing SM). If there was anything needed, it was a sequel or a completely new plot not a reboot. At the end of the movie, I felt like it was a nice movie BUT WAS THERE ANY NEED FOR IT ?PS - Some improvements are definitely there but there are some let downs as well, the movie has many scenes rushed into it. BUT I'll prefer Spiderman (2002) over ASM.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Fast-Paced Reinvention of a Hero,"The trilogy of the Spider-Man by Sam Raimi is very faithful to the comic book's hero from my childhood. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is not a bad movie, but is a fast-paced reinvention of the hero and therefore I was a little disappointed with the story.Peter Parker is no longer the outcast nerd that is bullied by everyone at high-school and needs to work to support his beloved Aunt May. He dates Gwen and immediately discloses his identity to her. After discovering that he has superpowers, he immediately jumps from the top of a building in a reckless attitude. He does not also grieve the loss of his Uncle Ben. There are many other differences regarding the original Spider-Man.The best that this film offers are the top-notch special effects that are very impressive. The story is only reasonable and I prefer Sam Raimi's movies. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Espetacular Homem-Aranha"" (""The Spectacular Spider- Man"")",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Watch It for Andrew Garfield's Winning Performance!,"'The Amazing Spider Man' lacks the excitement in comparison to the legendary the trilogy directed by Sam Raimi. But if you look at it as a new story all together, it offers some interesting moments. But, for me, this film works primarily for one reason: Andrew Garfield's Winning Performance as Peter Parker / Spider-Man!'The Amazing Spider-Man' Synopsis: Peter Parker finds a clue that might help him understand why his parents disappeared when he was young. His path puts him on a collision course with Dr. Curt Connors, his father's former partner.'The Amazing Spider Man' is fabulously shot & grandly made. But, I personally felt, that, the Screenplay wasn't up-to the mark. To give its due rightfully, there are some very interesting sequences & the action set-pieces are excellent, but overall, the desired impact, seems a bit missing.Screenplay by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent & Steve Kloves has merits, but it could've been stronger nonetheless. Marc Webb's Direction is stylish. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is vast. Graphics are outstanding. Action set-pieces, as mentioned, are excellent.Performance-Wise: Andrew Garfield is up for top honors. The actor is fantastic as Peter Parker / Spider-Man! Its a performance that deserves immense praise. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, does a good job. Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors / The Lizard, plays the menace easily. Martin Sheen as Ben Parker & Sally Field as May Parker are impressive, as always. Denis Leary as Captain George Stacy, is in command after a long time. Irrfan Khan as Dr. Rajit Ratha, deserved more footage.On the whole, 'The Amazing Spider Man' isn't Amazing, but stunning to look at nevertheless.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
it was a nice surprise when it actually turned out to be good,"STORY Well the story is fairly obvious, guy gets bitten by spider....guy becomes Spider-Man. It has been seen. However, its the other subplots and character developments which make this film actually (in my opinion) better than the 2002 film. I felt more attached to the characters like Uncle Ben for example. I won't go into details as I don't give spoilers but it was more emotional, and characters were much more relatable. The only real flaws I thought were the villain who's scenes felt a little rushed and the film didn't dwell on his character enough, and also the fact that Peter just wasn't nerdy enough, although that may be down to casting. 3/5EXECUTION Firstly, I really enjoyed the directing, and with the 3D it did actually look pretty impressive. The camera work was smooth and really made each scene stand out especially the ones that actually showed Spider-Man. The acting was good all round, I think Martin Sheen stole some of the scenes he was in and Rhys Ifans played the part of Dr Connors really well, although he probably was't seen enough as I would have liked. Andrew Garfield is a good actor but I'm just not sure he's right for this role, Spider-Man is meant to be the repressed but sarcastic science geek and that just wasn't carried out well. This is just nit picking though, the film was executed very well in my opinion. 4/5CONCLUSION After being dragged to this film by some mates, it was a nice surprise when it actually turned out to be good. It was slightly more gritty and emotional than the 2002 film whilst staying true to its roots. I'd recommend a watch as its probably worth seeing. At the very least I think people will be glad they saw it. 3/5 + 4/5 = 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great film, seems to be more geared toward a younger audience than previous films.","I enjoyed this movie because it was a superhero film with many funny bits. I like to be able to laugh while watching a movie, not just watch loads of CGI action. I also liked the fact that the villain wasn't killed just defeated and put in prison, giving him a second chance. However, I do believe that was partially do to the fact that the producers/writers wanted something to write a future film on. I think that Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone did exceptionally in their roles. Garfield really seemed to actually be Peter Parker and I love to see that in a film. Although this movie is a superhero movie I do believe it was geared toward a younger audience, unlike the Dark Knight. The fact that Spider-man is a teenager in this one and that it is not nearly as dark as some other films certainly convinced me of this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys action and superheroes.

""" Your abilities are not only a power, they are a responsibility ""","This movie "" The Amazing Spiderman, "" has been way over-due. Ever since it's initial creation by Stan Lee (who makes his usual Cameo appearance), audiences have been hungrily awaiting this new addition. This time, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) confronts a new and incredibly powerful super villain called, 'The Lizard'. Self created by a one armed scientist, named ( Rhys Ifans ) or Dr. Curt Connors, Spiderman unknowingly gives the fantastic formula to a desperate man who has been trying to invent a way for a human to re-generate a missing limb, without realizing the unfortunate side effects. From the beginning, the film has a dark, foreboding and sinister aspect, which pervades through the entire story. Indeed, this sequel returns to it's early history in that the audience is introduced to Parker's lost parents, as well as his present guardians superbly played by Martin Sheen (Who adds a bit of Panache to the movie and Sally Field. Furthermore, Parker is given a new girlfriend called Gwen Stacy and her father seriously played by Denis Leary. The movie itself is incredible, what with all new high flying action sequences, aerial effects and numerous exciting scenes. Although a bit heavy in using mostly nighttime exteriors, it does lend credence to Parker's equally somber state of mind. Over all, the film is grimly superior to earlier chapters and is therefore easily crafted to enthrall us. As a result, the cast and crew, have intentionally created a Classic in the process. Easily recommended to all. ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider Man is Amazing but movie wasn't,"i'm giving this movie 7 out of 10 because of it's action sequence and amazing spider man swing but it's having faults in lot of places.in the last spider man movie i saw exactly the same problems this movie is having.Action is there but not in details.Emotion was there but not matching up with spider man's aim to finish those who killed his uncle.The largest fault was""THE GREATEST SECRET DIDN'T REVEALED"".THAT'S WHY PICTURE WASN'T CLEAR FOR ME.AND WHAT YOU SAW IN THE TRAILER JUST FORGET ABOUT IT,THEY ARE ALL DELETED SCENES.even peter parker's father's leaving time speech wasn't there.Then spider man conversion wasn't clear too.how his DNA changed after spider biting..or what happened to him physically inside wasn't clear at all.he just converted in his sleep with some blurred dream..it's not at all enough.But yes after that all actions and lizard battle was great to watch.but again some actions weren't in details.3D effects were average.so i'm saying movie was enjoyable.""ONE TIME MUST WATCH"".BUT NOT MORE THAN THAT.here Toby Maguire's spider man won.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Damn near perfect,"This gets a lot of stick for being an unnecessary reboot and that would be the case if it wasn't so damn good.There is a lot going for this movie, everyone in the cast bounces off each other perfectly. The dynamic between Gwen and Pete was on point, it even brought the feels that I don't usually get. You can tell that they had good chemistry from the point they were introduced to each other, same goes for Pete and Captain Stacey wow. The dynamic was very interested, they actually had good reason to include him instead of shoehorning him into the story. I also love Martin Sheen, I actually forgot he was Martin Sheen and was just immersed by his performance of Uncle Ben. Massive props to Rhys Ifans, not only can he act but he can emote perfectly you can tell what he is thinking with his even having to say anything that was bloody good casting!I'd say that this is the best looking Spider-Man movie, yes that's included the recent Far From Home. For a start this isn't crammed with CGI, yes that is how the Lizard is done but the suit was actually made and looks great. That POV shot of him in the costume first is just amazing, the fight between him and the lizard was epic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Be amazed,"This movie truly delivers. Great cast, great acting, great story, great action, and most importantly great story telling. It's one of those movies that put you at its mercy. Slowly its invisible web tangles you around and before you know it, you're bound and powerless. You get immersed to the story, to the emotions of the scene. You can't help but to feel what Peter Parker is feeling. His pain, his anger, his joy, his anguish. And you want him to win over the villain. You're relieved when he overcomes obstacles. Then at the end of the movie you enthusiastically clap your hands together to applaud the great performance that you just saw. That's how I felt. I was reluctant to see it at first. The trailers didn't impress me. I've seen previous movies with Tobey Maguire and thought that they're pretty well made. Though I'm not a fan, the fact that they cast a different person to play the role of spider-man this time around was both confusing and appalling to me. Had the ticket not been free, I wouldn't have gone to see it. I came to the theater with no expectation other than that I'd be disappointed. But this movie turned me into a believer. This is the best spider-man movie. Andrew Garfield is Peter Parker. He even sounds like Peter Parker from the cartoon show. His performance was so great it's infectious. He deserves an Oscar notch for this role. Why not? Why can't a movie be entertaining and Oscar worthy at the same time? I'm sure this movie has flaws when you dissect it. And I'm sure it disappoints a lot of spider-man fans in some ways. But sometimes you just have to sit back, relax and enjoy the ride. What a great ride it was for me. 10 out of 10.PS.

"""A Fresh Web Slung""","*The Amazing Spider-Man* offered a reimagined origin story for Peter Parker, delving deeper into the character's backstory and motivations.Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Peter Parker brought a youthful and relatable quality to the character. His chemistry with Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was a highlight, adding a romantic and tragic dimension to the narrative. The film explored Peter's parents' mysterious disappearance, introducing a new layer of intrigue to the Spider-Man mythology.The film's villain, Dr. Curt Connors, played by Rhys Ifans, provided a tragic backstory and a compelling transformation into the Lizard. His obsession with regenerating limbs, driven by a desire to save his son, added depth to the antagonist. However, the execution of the Lizard's final confrontation felt somewhat rushed and anticlimactic.A pivotal moment in the film is the death of Uncle Ben, which serves as a catalyst for Peter's transformation into Spider-Man. The film takes a darker tone compared to its predecessors, emphasizing the consequences of Peter's actions.Visually, the film was impressive, with stunning action sequences and a modern aesthetic. The cityscapes of New York felt alive, and the web-slinging sequences were exhilarating. However, while the film attempted to ground itself in reality, certain plot elements, particularly those involving the Lizard, felt somewhat contrived.The introduction of the Oscorp Corporation and its connection to both Peter's parents and Dr. Connors laid the groundwork for potential sequels. The film's final scene, with the revelation of the Green Goblin's mask, hinted at a larger, interconnected universe.While *The Amazing Spider-Man* offered a fresh perspective on the character, it also faced criticism for retelling a familiar origin story.

"Not as good as the film it reboots, but still a solid Spider-Man film","Released in 2012 and directed by Marc Webb, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" stars Andrew Garfield as geeky teen Peter Parker, who is bit by a radioactive spider and acquires spider-like powers. Emma Stone plays his girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, while Denis Leary plays her father, the captain of the NYPD. Rhys Ifans plays the one-armed Dr. Curt Connors, who develops a dubious serum which morphs him into a human Lizard. Sally Field and Martin Sheen appear as Aunt May & Uncle Ben whereas Irrfan Khan is on hand as Connor's suspicious superior.While this is a solid Spider-Man film with an effective cast it can't hold a candle to the film it reboots, 2002's ""Spider-Man,"" which was still fresh in the mind in 2012 (and still is). Compare the Spider-Man costumes, for instance, particularly the masks; there's no contest. The story is basically the same except that (1.) Gwen Stacy is the girlfriend instead of Mary Jane, (2.) the Lizard is the villain instead of the Green Goblin, (3.) Spider-Man uses artificial web-shooters rather than intrinsic ones, and (4.) Captain Stacy basically replaces J. Jonah Jameson.The movie run 142 minutes and was shot in New York City and Los Angeles (or points nearby).GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Exciting, Action-Packed Reboot,,,,,But Is It Worth It?","Only five years after the universally-hated Spider-Man 3(not me, though), Columbia Pictures have decided to give Peter Parker and his alter ego, Spider-man a fresh start. This film is essentially quite similar to 2002's film, but also features a few differences mainly a personality change in Peter. I don't know if I like this film any better than the original trilogy. This film is action-packed, has a great cast, and a rather fun villain in ""The Lizard,"" but this film doesn't live up to the trilogy that gave Spider-Man a name for himself.Marc Webb's film explores the origins of Spider-Man and also unlike the trilogy, we learn more about Peter's past including what happened to his family. As Peter is exploring his past, he is lead to his father's former partner who happens to be too smart for his own good. Also, Peter strikes a relationship with the daughter of the police captain, Gwen Stacy.The acting is really not too bad. An Andrew Garfield/Emma Stone pairing is not as good as the Maguire/Dunst pairing, but they still do very good and it's nice to see some cockiness in Peter's attitude instead of complete nerdiness. The Lizard, played wonderfully by Rhys Ifans, is a good villain to watch. The rest of the cast rounded out with Denis Leary, Martin Sheen, and Sally Field gives this film some starpower.Overall, this is definitely not a bad film and it's very entertaining. But we must ask ourselves, is this a necessary reboot? Honestly, I would rather have seen a Spider-Man 4, but who's to complain.

They have killed and buried Spider Man.,"Movie was not bad but was expecting something different than the last time. The only thing changed was the story, that would not be appreciated by comic lover round the world. Spider man has somehow become more of a Romeo than a super hero. The super hero movies are now being produced to entertain a wide range of people, which is why I feel they have lost their intensity. The way these movies are coming out day is not far when middle aged mothers would be watching these with their little daughters. The creators these days have somehow become very sensitive and are now coming up with crying heroes. I hope the new batman movie would be better than The Amazing Spider Man.Please someone ask these creators to grow some balls and come up with movies like Predator, Terminator, Rambo, Matrix etc. Rather than remaking the same set of movies again and again ask them to come up with some original ideas, and not such amazing ideas.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Amazing Spider-Man: Unnecessary but bareable,"I was deeply unhappy when I heard about the filming of The Amazing Spider-Man, I believe in original ideas and with something as broad as Spiderman at least giving it a decent length of time before ""Rebooting"".It was too soon, the quality of the McGuire trilogy is irrelevant it was simply too soon to be starting again. Yet another origin story, another introduction to Gwen, another uncle Ben death scene and another villian.Andrew Garfield is dull, he simply didn't cut it as Spiderman and I consider Emma Stone to be one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood so the newly reborn franchise wasn't off to a great start in my eyes.So at over two hours at least they gave the movie a chance to shine, alas it doesn't though it's not the complete train wreck I expected.In this outing (And origin) Parker takes on The Lizard played by the always excellent Rhys Ifans who is simply too good for this movie.It has its moments but for $230 million it damn well should have had considerably more.The Good:Crane scene was greatLizard looked decentDennis Leary & Rhys IfansThe Bad:I really don't like Andrew GarfieldWeak soundtrackWas simply too soon after the last ""Reboot""Things I Learnt From This Movie:Some Lizards can grow limbs back at will...........at will!?Along with super powers spider bites also provide personalities",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It ain't bad,"It's a good movie, I recommend it. It really does nothing new with the Spider-man character but its a fun watch. Andrew Garfield fits into the role of Spider-man perfectly, but struggles to become Peter Parker; since Andrew Garfield does not have that same boyish charm Tobey Maguire had, he is not a nerd and you never believe it. The villain is pretty good, very over the top, but in the first 40 minutes he's interesting and unique, until he isn't. The villain is the lizard and seeing him fighting Spider-man is fun. The music is acceptable, it gives Spider-man a nice theme you can hum and the movie is quite inspiring. The end fight is very fun to watch and if you invest in the characters enough, you can feel some emotion in the end. Gwen Stacy is an excellent character and has great chemistry with Peter Parker. The origin story is kinda fascinating until you realize it's a more dumb downed version of the Raimi origin story. Uncle Ben literally says 'with great power comes great responsibility' but he couldn't say that exactly because then people would accuse it of being too similar, instead he says ""Your father had a philosophy, that if you could do good things for other people, you would've had a moral obligation to do those things. that's whats at stake, not choice....Responsibility' such a dumb downed speech.

One Guy in a Unitard,"Greetings again from the darkness. The big debate seems to be whether it is too soon for the Spider-Man franchise to be re-booted. It was just 10 years ago when Tobey Maguire first appeared as Spidey and a mere 5 years ago when director Sam Raimi delivered the last leg in his trilogy. Obviously the reason to re-boot starts with ""doll"" and ends with ""ars"". It is more interesting to decide if this is an improvement over the previous series.We must first look at Spider-man himself. Played here by Andrew Garfield, we get a more thoughtful Peter Parker and a more athletic Spidey version than we had with Maguire. As usual, my pet peeve is that Garfield is a 28 year old man cast as an 18 year old high school science nerd. Looking past that, Garfield manages to pull off the stunts without looking too much like a real super hero. So that's a plus. Luckily for him, his scenes with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) work because Ms. Stone is such a super talent. She makes everything she is in, just a little bit better.Next we look at the villain. Rhys Ifans plays scientist Dr Curt Connors, who transforms into Lizard in the quest to regenerate growth of his lost right arm. He was once partners with Peter's dad in their research into reptilian genetics. While Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) from Spider-Man 2 is still my favorite villain in the series, it's clear that Lizard is certainly capable of frightening the younger viewers, so parents beware. It should also be noted that Dr Curt Connors was played by Dylan Baker in the Sam Raimi trilogy.Lastly, we look at the story. This take is much more personal and provides detail to the backstory of Peter Parker. We learn how (but not exactly why) he lost his parents (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz) and see how he came to be raised by Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen). We see how he and Gwen Stacy come together and learn that she is every bit his equal intellectually, if not a notch above. Casting Dennis Leary as Gwen's Police Chief dad works as Leary and Garfield exchange barbs at the table. Peter is still a photographer, but this time for the school instead of The Daily Bugle ... whose logo makes an appearance on TV.Director Marc Webb was somehow selected for this despite his only feature film being (500) Days of Summer ... not exactly a film known for its CGI. Admittedly, the CGI used here is less rush and cluttered than in previous Spidey films and many of the stunts look to be real stunts instead of the fake stuff. The closing credit cookie clearly sets up the sequel, though I can only guess that the shadowy figure is Norman Osborn. That's still up for debate.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
not an amazing Spider-Man,"The Amazing Spiderman doesn't quite live up to be an amazing reboot of the franchise! But its a good one time watch, and probably lovable for those who got fed up with the Sam raimi - toby maguire Spiderman trilogy.. To be fair, The Amazing Spiderman might be close to the plots in comics, Ha! but then the rebooted comics version isn't a good reason to reboot an already successful movie series. Dejavu when you get to see too many scenes so identical to the 2002 film, understandably all grown from the same roots, hmm and like many, i strongly believe the reboot version was a bit early to be made..Some better things, however, worth mentioning : the pretty Emma stone who is much better than Kirsten Dunst ( don't give a darn whether its Gwen or Mary Jane, they are meant to be Spiderman's Lady love anyways). A strong villain in Dr.Lizard, thanks to good CGI (poor characterization and casting though) and finally Music composed By James Horner. Andrew Garfield is cute - a good leap from ""The Social Network"" - but isn't quite the lovable Peter Parker we know.The script, the dialogues and the closing lines were all lacking the firepower and the emotional vibrancy, just to make a comparison, the voice-over of Tobey's Spiderman(With great power comes great responsibility.

Not so amazing after all.,"So Spider-Man got a reboot after the great job that Sam Raimi had done for the previous three movies. This was due to a myriad of factors, including studio interference, and Raimi not being happy with the process. But how does Marc Webb (good name for a Spidey director, by the way) hold up against the guy who made the excellent and campy Evil Dead movies? Not too well.Honestly, the whole film is laden with this annoying sheen that really makes it difficult to enjoy. Whereas Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films emphasized the self-aware and campy nature of the comic book character, Webb directs in a fairly annoying CW-like style. The 3D cameras simply do not film in a high quality that you might expect out of a 200 million dollar blockbuster. It's literally the equivalent of a semi well-shot TV show. The CGI for the Lizard is like something you would see on Supernatural, and the acting is actually quite a bit worse than that.Andrew Garfield tries, he really does, but he can't measure up to Tobey's brilliantly understated performance. Emma Stone is just kind of there, but has no real point. When made the focus, Stone can really shine, but here she plays second fiddle and simply fades into the background. The only solid performance in the film is Rhys Ifans as Dr. Connors; the man can act, and although most of his most popular roles are comedic, this shows that he can do a solid dramatic job as well. Too bad his role is criminally underused, and doesn't approach anywhere near the amount of screen time that a villain should be given.The thing that really brings the movie down is the terrible writing and directing. The writing takes so many steps to copy the original Spider-Man, yet also tries to do its own thing, leaving the film a huge jumbled mess. It's obvious that some craft was put into this film, but unfortunately not enough to make it a worthwhile viewing.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Fantastic Marvelous Amazing Generic Superhero Movie,"I don't have any childhood attachment to Spiderman like most other people do. I was more a Superman person. When the Sam Raimi version of ""Spiderman"" came out, it was a fresh take and felt it was ""what a Superhero movie should be"". It was not all bluster, and Tobey Maguire had an alluring charm. On the other hand, there was always the moment where everyone could tell we were no longer watching live action, and essentially switched over to watching a Spiderman cartoon. It didn't hurt the quality of the film, I knew from Sam Raimi and composer Danny Elfman's soundtrack work that it was in good hands. That was until Spiderman 3 (see my review).Spiderman 3 did for me what ""Batman & Robin"" did for that franchise. Wisely, the studio put Batman back on the shelf in 1997. The origin story for the Batman franchise was presented in the first film in 1989, SIXTEEN YEARS before the complete reboot and retelling of the origin story in 2005. Here, Sony (watch for Sony product placement in TASM), within just 5 years, is rebooting and is shoving the same familiar origin story last seen just 10 years ago. 16 years is almost a generation between reboots. 10 years for Spiderman is too soon. I have been watching 'modern' superhero movies for the last 12 years (starting with the first ""X-Men""), and there have been some truly great inspirational releases over that time. But there are so many superhero movies out there, and they all have the same clichés now. It is the same generic formula over and over:1. Innocent Boy 'A' wants to date Innocent Daughter 'B' of Successful Father 'C'. 2. 'A' finds secret power. 3. 'A's father 'D' dies, causing 'A' mental anguish. 4. Scientist 'X' becomes Designated Super Villain 'Y'. 5. 'A' becomes superhero 'Z', both loved and hated. 6. 'Z' Threatens 'B', causes panic in Gothametropolis. 7. 'A' is in mental tug-of-war whether to fight crime or marry 'B'.And so on.. However in this unnecessary Spiderman reboot, the generic formula is worse'D' is also 'X' while 'C' hates 'A' and 'B' knows about 'Z'.I am becoming burned out on the traditional super hero films. No, this reboot is not ""Batman Begins"" just because they put in the Hans Zimmer WWWHHHHOMMMPPP music stings and busy strings in the soundtrack. Maybe they thought this would feel more authentic by adding a lot of old furniture in the movie. They also tried to add authenticity by casting genuine Academy-caliber actors as the aunt (Sally Field) and uncle (Martin Sheen). But as the movie began telling the origin story again, wasting too much time setting up sequel bait, I began to groan almost right away. Andrew Garfield is the new Tobey Maguire, and yes he is a likable boy/man (he looks like a college student going to a high school). His character is not quite the same Peter Parker. Now he is jumpy and has better agility before his transformation. Garfield's charisma wins you over, thankfully, because having to sit through the same story plot points was starting to give me restless leg syndrome.I have been a veteran movie-goer for over 40 years, and I just can't get into cliché teenage romance stories these days. At least the original Spiderman set Peter in college, and a far more interesting life. Scenes of skateboarding and high school socializing are meant to connect with the young crowd, but they feel clunky and cliché nonetheless. I know this is a big 220 million dollar film, so I was impatient for the movie to get to the big action scenes. The movie finally gets you there, and the effects are clearly better than the original ""Spiderman"" for the most part, but that is to be expected over the course of 10 years. They are well done and are exciting, but are relatively straightforward. The villain for this film is a lizardman, who looks menacing enough, but is not a Super Villain by any stretch of the imagination. Any member of the audience who saw ""The Avengers"" earlier in the summer will get a sense of deja-vu, as the Stark tower appears, almost identical, in this film as the centerpiece of the big final action scene. There is a desperate attempt to incorporate a number of skycranes as part of the big finale that makes no sense whatsoever, and provides very little payoff anyway.I was waiting over two hours for this? Yet another fight on top of yet another skyscraper? Been there, done that, way too many times. I will still recommend the film for the action scenes and the ability of Garfield to carry the film. But it is not as good as Raimi's interpretation , especially ""Spiderman 2"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
These IMDb reviewers don't know what they are talking about!,"OK, let me start off with the other people, they clearly are not comic book fans, and don't pay attention to the news, what people are not realizing is not everything we expected to see is revealed in this movie, it's gonna play out later in the series. Alright on to the movie, now I myself was concerned that this movie wasn't going to live up to my expectations, I was wrong. Marc Webb and his crew did an amazing job making a great story told again in a way that actually works, Not to mention they hired a great and talented cast for the movie, Andrew Garfield mostly. He really pulls off that nerdy look of Peter Parker that just didn't look that great on Tobey Maguire. Now I wasn't a big fan of Kirsten Dunst, I never was. Emma stone was a lovable character, and I can really see the chemistry between her and Garfield that looks realistic. Now Rhys Ifans was an interesting character, and his acting was very well done for the lizard. Now this was my only issue for the movie, the lizard was entertaining, but he wasn't as enjoyable as the green goblin William Defoe played in Sam Rami's series. And in shorter words everyone did great being their characters. Now as far as the FX go, they were spectacular, the CG used for the Lizard was impressive too, they are only a few action sequences in the movie, but I didn't care! Peter's character was entertaining all the way through, what some people don't realize about Spidey is he's just a kid, and that life wasn't all Pilates from the city when he began his job as the web slinger; what I see in great comic book movies like this and batman Begins is the realism, cops just don't trust masked vigilantes immediately that's all part of the realism, that's why they prove themselves heroes later in their stories. So above all 10/10, the movie is great, ignore these crazy IMDb reviews and just enjoy the ride!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider-Man is not too amazing this time round,"That said though, from personal opinion The Amazing Spider-Man was not a bad film, or at least nowhere near as bad as has been said(again personal opinion), but it doesn't live up to its name. For me, the first two Sam Raimi Spider-Man films are better, and while Spider-Man did plod and had too many villains all but one of which were underused personally it wasn't that bad. The Amazing Spider-Man did have things to like, it is very stylishly made and has some very impressive special effects, even if the Lizard takes some getting used to. The action sequences- of which there are a lot in the second half- mostly are exciting with some cool stunts(the one exception is the climax which seemed like it was played and written too safe) and very creative use of Spider-Man's powers, and there are some parts in the story that work, the dynamic between Peter and Uncle Ben is really quite emotionally powerful, the romance between Peter and Gwen is somewhat sweet and the part where Spider-Man saves the little boy is tense and heart-felt. It was also very intriguing with the mystery of Peter's parents which was done quite well. The performances on the whole are also good, Sally Field and especially Martin Sheen are great as Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and Emma Stone is a charming and amusing Gwen. Rhys Ifans does bring some creepiness to Curt Connors/The Lizard if not the tragedy(the writing didn't help him though) and Denis Leary is delightful in how churlish he is. On the whole too there is some good chemistry between the actors. I never really warmed to Andrew Garfield though, he did seem too quirky for Peter complete with some forced humour and wasn't enough of a nerd, he wasn't a whole lot better as Spider-Man either, he had charisma but did come across as rather smug and not brooding enough for such a serious tone to the story here. Irrfan Kahn's performance and his character is little more than an extended cameo, not very much to work with and Kahn does little with it. The story does have its fair share of well-done moments but does suffer from an over-familiarity that feels like a more seriously toned rehash and uneven pacing, sluggish in the first half and while much better rushed in some of the second half. The script is never terrible nor is it ever exceptional, there are sweet and emotional moments as well as tense ones but too much of the humour is forced and it interferes with the serious tone. James Horner's score is nowhere near among his best, some of it pedestrian, some of it over-the-top, neither of which Danny Elfman's scoring had. And the film really rushed Connors'/Lizard's character arc, there was real potential for him to be a multi-layered character but here he came across as a one-dimensional villain with no real motivation. Overall, watchable but not close to being amazing. 5.5/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not quite amazing, but very entertaining","I must admit I wasn't expecting much from The Amazing Spiderman. I knew the special effects would be great, but I had my doubts whether Marc Webb would be able to add anything new and interesting to the Spiderman franchise, particularly since it has only been a few years since the Sam Raimi version was in theaters.Well he did, and he didn't.The casting of Andrew Garfield as Spiderman/Peter Parker was a great choice. Gone is the klutzy and nerdy Peter Parker played by Toby Maguire in the Sam Raimi version. In his place is a normal kid (although very intelligent), who while not being the most popular student at his school is not the class dork either.This version of Spiderman also concentrates more on what happened to Peter's parents, and the effect that has had on him. The discovery by Peter of his father's suitcase and the ensuing investigation, is what leads him to becoming Spiderman. This investigation into his parents' disappearance will apparently be one of the common threads that will tie in future installments of Webb's Spiderman.Gone also was The Daily Bugle, J Jonah Jameson and Mary Jane Watson, and although they will all return in The Amazing Spiderman 2, due out in 2014, I did miss the rantings of JJJ, portrayed so wonderfully well by J. K. Simmons in the previous version.Marc Webb has instead used Gwen Stacey as Peter's love interest in his adaptation, played very service-ably by Emma Stone, and to be honest the chemistry between Stone and Garfield is much better than that between Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, who played Spiderman and MJW respectively in the Sam Raimi films.Denis Leary who is always good joins the cast as Gwenn's father – police Captain Stacey, and as is becoming a trend in super hero movies, big name actors are playing the parts of the hero's parents, or in this case uncle and aunt, with Sally Field and Martin Sheen taking on the roles of Aunt May and Uncle Ben. Both, as usual give very polished performances.The excellent Rhys Ifans plays the one armed Dr Curt Conners, who used to work with Peter's father at Oscorp until he disappeared, and since then has been struggling to complete their work on cross species genetics on his own; unable to discover the final equation that will allow it to go forward.Peter supplies Conners with the equation, and following pressure from his boss at Oscorp tests the formula on himself. Of course it has unintentional side effects, and as well as repairing his lost arm, turns him into a giant lizard who then wreaks havoc throughout New York; as well as trying to turn everyone else in the city into creatures like himself.And the battle between Spiderman and the Lizard begins. As expected the special effects are great, and although I am not usually a fan of 3D, I highly recommend seeing The Amazing Spiderman in that format if possible, as the scenes of him swinging through New York are (no pun intended) amazing.Marc Webb has done a fine job. There are holes in the script and story, but they are not that noticeable, and it can get a bit clichéd at times, but these things are to be expected in a big budget film such as this; however they can also be forgiven.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed The Amazing Spiderman, and am looking forward to the next installment of Marc Webb's version, which at this stage will see Jamie Foxx playing the villain Electro and is due out in 2014.7.5 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"new Spiderman, slight tone change","It's a new reboot of Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). This time, the love interest is Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). There is a bit about his parents tying them to Peter's powers.Marc Webb takes over the franchise. It's a surprising move but he does a good job. It's slightly less comical than Sam Raimi. Andrew Garfield is the same age as Tobey Maguire when he started, but Andrew looks much older. It's hard to imagine him as a high school nerd. Andrew looks his age which is 27-28 whereas Tobey always looks like a kid. Andrew really looks like one of the cool art kids with a guitar. Emma Stone is great as the love interest. Rhys Ifans is the villain but the problem is his CG avatar. He's a lizard and doesn't have much personality. Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin and Alfred Molina as Doc Ock are far superior villains than Rhys Ifans. So the franchise continues, but not a total revolution. Just new people. The constant rebooting may wear people out someday.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider Man for Teens,"While Tobey Maguire was your 'friendly, neighbourhood Spider-Man', Andrew Garfield is more like your 'hip, juvenile, generation Y' Spider-Man. The kind of superhero unafraid of calling on his mobile phone in a busy New York street corner and the kind of superhero who lies on a self-made web playing video games whilst waiting for his foes to appear. Despite this slightly novel approach, 'The Amazing Spider Man' is just a rehash of Sam Raimi's original 'Spider Man', much of the plot is either similar, identical or along the same lines with a tweak here and there making more than half the film somewhat of an unnecessary recap of sorts.It was certainly pleasing to have a script addressing the reasoning behind a burning question, why does Peter Parker live with his aunt and uncle? But even this combined with Peter Parker/Spider Man's other traumas in the film don't give us a good enough definition of Spider-Man as a symbol, the motivation behind Peter Parker's graduation from angry vengeance to selfless nobility.One noteworthy change was the magnificent camera work which puts you up close and personal with Spider-Man through the first-person shots and dynamic angles employed. At times, it felt like a virtual rollarcoaster ride but it was definitely the closest most people will get to knowing what it's like to be the famous web-slinger.Garfield knew his deal portraying Peter Parker as more of a typical 21st century confused, directionless adolescent but one who seems to be more noticed than what you would expect. He may not have been the less appealing, geeky Peter Parker as earlier personified by Tobey Maguire but where Maguire trumps Garfield was in turning a genuine nobody into somebody whilst maintaining that anonymity.Garfield's Parker was already garnering the affections of a pretty girl and was operating far from what you would call incognito, a guy quite willing to divulge his secret to a perfect stranger. The contrast between the person and his alter ego defines a superhero and Garfield couldn't really highlight that contrast as effectively. You could connect with him, but unlike his 'The Social Network' performance, he lacked even a slight bit of maturity. The script further failed to deal with social implications transforming him into a public icon. Ultimately, a superhero is naught without public opinion and interest.Emma Stone fortunately wasn't the constant damsel in distress like Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane but Gwen Stacy's relationship with Peter Parker furthered the sentiment that the film seemed to become too teen conducive. Not that the teen appeal is a completely bad thing, but the lack of maturity in the characters can occasionally be weak in conviction.I must express my disappointment in the villainous Lizard however as a character which could not invoke as much terror on screen as its terrific design could to viewers. Rhys Ifans was curiously very similar in his character progression as Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin in Raimi's 'Spider Man'. Although Curt Connors was well played, he made you feel as if you'd seen it all before.Although I still enjoyed it, I think the enjoyment stemmed more from my unwavering appreciation of the comic book character. Nonetheless, with this relatively immature yet respectably enjoyable origin story done and dusted, I anticipate a more complete sequel which can surpass this. More originality may well be a dominant reason.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Adds nothing...,"It seems that we live in the era of useless remakes...And these remakes are a clear demonstration of the total lack of creativity and originality that has been plagued major (more expensive) cinematographic endeavors.

Aren't there tons of superheroes that are as or more interesting than Spiderman? Why the same old story where uncles, friend, etc. die?These guys are clearly betting (and winning) on the dumbing-down of the average movie-goer.

Disposable Comic Book Entertainment; I Miss Raimi Already...,"How many times must Uncle Ben die for our amusement? If ever there was a movie franchise that embodied modern Hollywood's obsession with rebooting and reimagining the past, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is it. It's only been ten years since Sam Raimi brought the web-slinger to the big screen and helped jump-start the comic book movie craze, and it's only been five years since the trilogy came to an embarrassing end with the dud that was SPIDER-MAN 3. Now, rather than pick up where the last films left off and continue on in exciting new directions with a new director, Sony Pictures decided we might as well just start fresh. And that means a reintroduction to Spider-Man's origins, despite the fact that everyone knows by now how Peter Parker came to be New York's web-slinging superhero. I have no problem with rebooting a character franchise and handing the direction over to a new talent, but I don't see why we need to retread old ground. The entire first hour of THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN rehashes everything we've already seen in Raimi's SPIDER-MAN in 2002. Except this one is handled a bit differently, which I suppose is why it's supposed to be all right. Parker's parents are more of a central focus in his eventual decision to become Spider-Man and it's his investigation that leads him to his encounter with the radioactive spider in the first place. I'm not sure why it couldn't have been handled in a ten or fifteen minute flashback. When you think about it, Uncle Ben's death was retconned and altered the story with a few flashbacks in SPIDER-MAN 3 and it worked all right without spending an hour going over the whole scenario again.The aggravating part is, once the first hour is done and the groundwork for the Parker parents storyline is laid out, the movie shifts gears into a generic superhero storyline that loses interest. Spider-Man's first challenge in his new role is battling the Lizard. Dr. Connors was introduced in SPIDER-MAN 2 and maintained a presence through the last two Raimi movies, so we knew the Lizard was eventually going to make an appearance. I just wonder if Raimi would've handled him better as a villain. Raimi's villains were always interesting. Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus were near perfect, and even the villains in 3 weren't bad for the extent that Raimi was able to use them when crammed into a single movie. Connors has the appropriate motivation (regrowing his missing arm with cross-species genetics) and the Lizard's arrival on the scene is handled well, but his overall plan is just generic. It's a plan we've seen countless times before in other action films, both superhero and normal. As a result, the movie loses a lot of steam and only becomes interesting again when Spider-Man and the Lizard are battling it out on screen. I enjoyed the movie when I first saw it in theaters, even while recognizing that it had some problems. But each subsequent viewing has weakened it and now I'm mostly bored with the whole thing.My biggest complaint with THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is that it doesn't feel like a Spider-Man movie. I know the character has been involved in some darker stories but I've always seen the Spider-Man series as a more light-hearted, fun series. Marc Webb's reboot is almost depressing. There's a lot of low lighting and dark colors. Characters always act depressed and angry. Spider-Man fits in a handful of good quips when he's doing his crime-fighting bit but the majority of the movie feels like a downer. Cheer up, people. It's Spider-Man. Leave the gloom for Batman or the Punisher. On a more positive note, the casting was great. Andrew Garfield will make a fine replacement for Tobey Maguire if the filmmakers can lay off the drama and let him have some fun. Emma Stone is a beautiful Gwen Stacy and brings the most levity to the movie. Regardless of how depressing the movie gets, her character's bright eyes and optimistic demeanor comes through. Rhys Ifans was great as Connors, though it's a shame his CG Lizard reminds me of a Goomba from the miserable SUPER MARIO BROS movie. I suppose it's just the lack of a protruding snout. The filmmakers claim they did away with the snout because they couldn't really make him speak with it. That may be so, but at least he would look like a Goomba on steroids. Martin Sheen is wasted as Uncle Ben, and Denis Leary is one of the better characters with Captain Stacy. Really, for the most part, the casting was perfect and should've made for a better movie.THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is mediocre summer fun. If this had debuted in a year with weaker competition, it might've stood out more. But no, sorry, this movie has nothing on Whedon's AVENGERS or Nolan's DARK KNIGHT RISES. As a result, the introductory film in Sony's new Spider-Man series falls pretty flat and I doubt most people will find much more in it than throwaway entertainment before moving on to bigger and better comic book films. It doesn't live up to Raimi's first two Spider-Man films, but at least I can honestly say it was better than SPIDER-MAN 3.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) - The Untold Story!,"Directed by Marc Webb, and released to immediate box office success, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a reboot of the original Spider-Man trilogy from director Sam Raimi, that's also the first in a new and re-imagined version of the series! I have been looking forward to check out this movie ever since the news came out. But even though I was entertained by the majority of it all, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is my first big disappointment of the year, but it sure is a guilty pleasure. This movie follows the exact story about a boy in high school, Peter Parker, whose been abandoned by his parents, lives with his aunt and uncle, and can't fit in with his surroundings. Until he gets bit by a radioactive spider, gets impossible powers, something tragic happens in his life, and now becomes Spider-Man. It's the basic idea, yet retold in quite an unnecessary way. That's just my main problem with this movie, now that I've seen this film, it's finally clear to me that a reboot of the Amazing Spider-Man just wasn't a bright idea. I know that some reboots like to change some material, to not make it too similar to the original story. But this movie definitely takes the cake, making major changes to a story that doesn't need to be re-told. Also, this movie totally falls into a mother-load of plot holes. The movie tries to focus on Peter trying to find out what happened to his parents, and live through the tragedy involving his uncle, but the movie quickly takes that away, and instead focuses on Spider-Man saving the city from the Lizard. This movie had no clue which way it wanted to follow! But, did I mention that it was kind of long, and at the same time, kind of slow? Yeah, that's what I thought! But, good news, there were a few positives that helped save this movie. The casting is completely brilliant, all delivering such wonderful and memorable performances. Andrew Garfield really saves this movie, recreating the role of Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man. If it wasn't for his performance, this movie would have fallen to the ground. In every scene, he delivers a great charm to the performance, and makes the audience support him throughout. Emma Stone is also great playing Parker's love-life Gwen Stacy, whom also shares a believable and glowing chemistry between her and Garfield. I bought the romance in this movie, and these two guys were cute together. Although not really interesting as the Lizard, Rhys Ifans still delivers a great performance as Dr. Curtis Connors. Denis Leary plays Capt. George Stacy, Gwen's cop father hunting down the masked hero, and Uncle Ben & Aunt May are portrayed masterfully by Martin Sheen and Sally Field, respectively. The effects are astounding, the music is haunting, and the action scenes just help save this movie by delivering what I came for, fun popcorn entertainment. But overall, there's nothing really special about this movie. Some scenes kind of feel misplaced, there are tons of giant plot holes, and changing this story wasn't that smart. Nothing is terrible about this movie, because I still came to this movie and got what I wanted. I just wish that this movie could have been a lot better, and I was really expecting more from this giant motion picture. Not a terrible film overall, but ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a fun spectacle, but it's barely quite not the right choice to be rebooted. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", in my review, ""exciting fun, but sadly unnecessary"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Entertaining, but not the best","Because of all the recent super hero movies and because the last Spiderman was only a few years ago, everyone's gonna compare them with all the videos & super hero movies they've watched in the past.This version excels in a couple of ways to the Spidey's of the past, but fails in too many ways to be as good as past efforts. The web slinging and references to the Marvel comic's art work was excellent, far better then any past Spiderman films, and the fight scenes in a couple of instances were better choreographed in the closer shots.But, the story was not as well written as either of the first two Raimi films, the character development was rushed, the editing was almost as bad as Spiderman 3 with missing pieces that jolted the eye and made the mind wonder. In other words, the CGI was excellent but the attention to detail of the real shots were poorly thought out. Example: Peter passes the doctor a coffee with his hand over the rim and in the next shot Parker's fingers are through the handle. Sloppy camera work happened like that thruout the film.All in all it was entertaining and fairly well done, yet not a classic, nothing really new here. I'm sure it'll do well, the actors were good, and I look forward to seeing them try it again in the sequels.

The inclusion of Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard was long overdue and was played adequately by Rhys Ifans, Martin Sheen and Sally Field were great as Uncle Ben and Aunt May as was Dennis Leary's Captain Stacy.In short, a solid cast, great story and wonderful effects inject new blood into an already great blockbuster franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Amazing Spider-Man is truly amazing!,"Like a lot of people, I didn't like how they were starting the Spider- Man movies from the beginning again but when I heard that it would be more true to the comics, I really began to look forward to it and it really lived up to my expectations with its cast, script, action and directing. But I still enjoy the original Spider-Man trilogy, except Spider-Man 3 which disappointed many fans. But I can admit even the first two movies got cheesy at times, particularly the acting and directing. And I've even heard that some people didn't like the trilogy for how campy they were or how untrue to the comics they were.But I mean I thought Tobey Maguire was too weak and didn't really fit the character of Peter Parker/Spider-Man and he acted too much like a geek. Kirsten Dunst was a good choice for Mary Jane but as the movies went on she became annoying and selfish, especially in the third one and I didn't like how she acted so helpless.But I really think, like most people, that Andrew Garfield is amazing as Spider-Man/Peter Parker because he fits the character better and more importantly he's a better actor. And I love how he acted more of a wiseguy, which Spider-Man is supposed to be. And Emma Stone was an even better lead lady as Gwen Stacy because she actually helped out. And Rhys Ifans did very well and maybe even kind of intimidating as Dr. Connors/The Lizard. The battle scenes and special effects are amazing with The Lizard and Spider-Man were really exciting and had me at the edge of my seat.Some of the thing that makes this movie better than the 2002 one, is that it has more to do with Peter's parents, who were never mentioned in the trilogy. And we actually get to see Uncle Ben get shot. And there more funny parts as well. The Stan Lee cameo was the funniest. And of course, the story of is more true to the comics as well.I know some people found The Amazing Spider-Man disappointing or they prefer the original trilogy but I think people should be giving this movie more credit even though some parts were kind of similar to the Spider-Man of 2002. But I mean it's like the Spider-Man version of Batman Begins, in fact it probably should be on IMDb's Top 250 if The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises. I mean it's much gritter, funnier, and more mature and more realistic than the trilogy.Not to mention it's one of the most anticipated and best movies of 2012.

"'Secrets have a cost. They're not free. Not now, not ever.'","Why we needed another Spiderman series after the recent (2002/2007) Tobey McGuire run is probably the same reason we keep getting remakes of foreign films (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, etc): they make money. And it looks like the public will never tire of Marvel Comic Book stories, so might as well settle in and give them a try. It is an evening's entertainment approaching 3 hours of visual shenanigans that are pretty entertaining.There are some differences between this Spiderman and the last - aside from cast: the stories are different although they both claim to show the origin of this magic transformation of a lonely confused young man trying to figure out who he is until he discovers some super secrets and the power to change into a humanoid spider-gifted hero. It all starts out well enough - Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is shy and unable to relate to about everyone except his aunt and uncle (Sally Field and Martin Sheen do a fine job here). He fails at a run-in with the high school bully Flash (a hunky and promising Chris Zylka), is noticed by the perky Gwen (Emma Stone) who is involved in Peter's introduction to scientist Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) who is an old friend of Peter's strangely disappeared father (Campbell Scott) and mother (Embeth Davidtz). Peter is smart, discovers a formula in his father's briefcase, and ultimately is able to transform himself into Spiderman - his nemesis being The Lizard who is actually Dr. Connors taking a potent experimental solution. After a lot of flying around on buildings and throwing spider web tendrils at everything including The Lizard, Peter is hunted as a threat until Gwen's policeman father (Denis Leary) eventually bonds with the insecure Peter in a life saving situation. Then we are given footage of what is up for the sequel...The human (read 'credible') parts work the best - Garfield and Stone make a fine pair and Sheen and Field give fine cameos. Once the transformation takes place the film becomes a lesson in special effects and that is fun enough to watch. It just goes on far too long...and there is more to come. Makes you wonder when the next cycle of Spiderman will come along.Grady Harp",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Why ?!,"Andrew Garfield is a terrific actor. Martin Sheen is a superb actor. Sally Field is a mind shatteringly brilliant actor. Marc Webb, well he sure does an OK remake of what was a brilliant film. I cant knock him doing a remake 10 years after , or can I . Feel like you have been here before but someone is tweaking details to avoid looking exactly like the original. This is in no way close to what the original film in originality though and if you went back in time and stopped them making the original this would de-evolve into a boneless mess because of what Sony did . Sony wanted to reboot ala Batman for the profit and nothing else. There are no great lines for Andrew, Martin or Sally. They seem lost in this hopeless reboot! Yes , yes I know it didn't ""suck"" but it not ""sucking "" doesn't excuse that it was pointless and derivative. With all the places they could have gone in maturing Parker and family , the characters that developed and challenged the world. What about Spider Man vs the republican party, anything but to waste all of our time with another reboot . Marc is not Christopher Nolan here, he could be but Sony cheated him!

A decent series reboot,"It was only ten years ago that Spider-Man, the first cinematic adaptation of one of Marvel's crown jewel characters, was released to generally strong critical notices and boffo box-office. After two additional entries, the 2nd being another hit, the 3rd dropping a bit in quality, Sony Pictures and original helmer Sam Raimi couldn't see eye to eye on future entries, so Raimi walked away, and Sony elected to follow in the footsteps of James Bond and Batman and ""reboot"" the franchise only five years since the last entry. This would prove to be a controversial choice with many (I have at least one friend who said he had no interest in seeing the reboot), but I was willing to give this new entry the benefit of the doubt. In general, I can say I was glad I did. The new entry, titled The Amazing Spider-Man, is a fairly strong film for the most part. Sporting a good turn in the lead by Andrew Garfield and an expanded focus on the relationship between Peter and his first girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, The Amazing Spider-Man manages to vindicate itself from those who might doubt it.The Amazing Spider-Man does re-hash the origin story that most are probably familiar with at this point, albeit with some new twists on the material. In this incarnation, Peter Parker is left with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) under mysterious circumstances by his parents in the middle of the night in the opening scenes of the film. When the narrative jumps forward to the present, Peter is a gawky outsider, imagined as both a science nerd but also a bit of a teenage rebel, riding a skateboard and slightly flaunting authority. When he discovers a briefcase of his father's in the basement, Peter begins asking questions about his father's work, which leads him to Oscorp, the company his father worked for. There, he encounters Dr. Chuck Connors (Rhys Ifans), his father's former partner, and the two begin working to complete Peter's father's work. However, the research into genetic regeneration has a dark side, as it would appear that it is intended to be used by Norman Osborne, the unseen head of the company, as a tool to help save his life, and who seems to know something about the reason Peter's parents disappeared.Upon his first visit to Oscorp, Peter happens into a room where testing is being performed on spiders, and one manages to bite him. The result, of course, is that the spider bite imbues him with extraordinary powers: strength, speed and a remarkable ability to scale buildings as if his hands and feet had tape bonded to them. After Uncle Ben is killed in an accidental shooting, Peter begins to use these abilities, along with a formula for advanced webbing his father developed, to search out the criminal responsible for Ben's death. Peter begins to expand his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), a classmate who is also an intern at Oscorp. He also begins to wonder about Dr. Connors, who is acting strangely and, when faced with the shutdown of his research, injects himself with the genetic formula, transforming himself into a creature that becomes known as the Lizard, and this experience sends him on a path to madness that Peter must try to stop.The biggest weaknesses of The Amazing Spider-Man are, unsurprisingly, the revisiting of the same material that was brought to life 10 years ago. Most audience members are familiar with the spider bite, the moments of Peter discovering his powers, and his hunt for Ben's killer. It also doesn't help that in the years since the release of the first Spider-Man, countless other super hero film adaptations have seen the light of day and mined similar material. At this juncture, the origin story plot has really started to show both its age and its overexposure. That being said, The Amazing Spider-Man does approach most of these moments in a different vein than the prior entry. A key difference is to focus on Peter's budding relationship with Gwen Stacy, Peter's first girlfriend in the comics but a character that was relegated to cameo status in Spider-Man 3. Garfield and Stone bring a degree of chemistry and involvement to the relationship and this element of the film feels stronger than the Peter/Mary Jane pairing in the earlier films.Garfield also proves a capable lead in the role of Peter. While Tobey Maguire largely focused on portraying Peter as a somewhat shy nerd, for lack of a better term, Garfield's performance enhances Peter's nervousness and captures the awkwardness of the teenage years, stammering in his dialogue at times and giving Peter a degree of uncertainty in his moments with Gwen. It isn't necessarily better than Maguire's turn, but it is sufficiently different to not feel like a rehash. Stone proves a bit more fetching and strong willed than Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane, and her realization of Gwen is certainly the stronger female presence when compared to Dunst.The Amazing Spider-Man also excels on the technical front. The visual effects that bring the action sequences to life are impressive, to say the least, and the film benefits from the decade of development in technology since the first Spider-Man. The moments in which Spider-Man soars through the city and faces off against the Lizard are eye-opening, and prove viscerally involving. James Horner's music score is also a standout, providing a fairly traditional symphonic score in a day and age where so many films are moving towards a sound design influenced musical environment.There is no denying that The Amazing Spider-Man arrives with quite a bit of baggage attached, and it isn't completely successful at slaying all of the downfalls of revisiting this material, but for the most part, this entry works, and proves, like 1998's The Incredible Hulk, that there is more than one decent modern interpretation of a traditional comic book hero.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Good but not Great Spider-Man,"First let me just say, this is not a negative review. The Amazing Spider-Man met my expectations. Nothing more, nothing less. This reboot gets a lot of things right. Marc Webb does an excellent job, he creatively and playfully filmed the action scenes and successfully executed his own fresh, unique vision of Spidey's adventures. The scenes where Spider-Man is swinging through New York City are breath-taking and vertigo-inducing., perhaps even more-so than Sam Raimi's.The cast was perfectly chosen and I can't really think of any role in the movie I would have rather seen another actor fill. Andrew Garfield makes for a much better Spider-Man than Tobey Maguire in my opinion, he brings a lot of charm and cheekiness to the role that wasn't really seen in Raimi's trilogy, this film really shows Peter Parker develop as a character throughout, and the chemistry here between Garfield and Stone is excellent.I had issues with a few things though. The CGI on the most part was incredible but The Lizard looked laughable. He looked like a cartoon Godzilla and was less menacing and frightening than I would have liked to see. The villain and character of Curt Connors was really underwritten in my opinion, and it failed to really fully utilise Rhys Ifans' acting capabilities.Whilst the director's take on it was visually distinct from the other trilogy, it wasn't really the ""untold story"" as the marketing would have us believe. Sure, it threw in a few extra sub plots and tweaks here and there (so he made the web shooters himself, what a game changer THAT one was), but the majority was stuff we've already seen. This would have been forgivable, had this not been released a mere 10 years after the original (and 5 years after the last one!)Ultimately I did have a good time watching The Amazing Spider-Man, and I'm sure many others will do as well. It shouldn't massively disappoint anyone, just don't expect anything too spectacular here. A sequel is very much on the cards, and now the origin story is done and out of the way, with the talented cast and crew involved, I believe and hope the franchise becomes genuinely original and starts to go places Raimi's trilogy never did. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Thoroughly entertaining, but still the second best....","I had the opportunity of watching this movie on the second day of its release on this Saturday. Nearly 4 days before the actual US release.Firstly lets leave the whole, ""Oh! its a reboot and not a sequel"" thing outside the door. Its something the industrial analysts must be bothered about. As an audience it does not matter to me. I just want a movie to be entertaining and this movie is really better than the first Spiderman movie. This movie is getting unfair treatment as its a reboot. This movie should be judged by its own merit and not by comparisons.I consider myself blessed and entertained.... This may not be one of the jump-the-gun fast paced superhero flicks, it takes it time to establish the characters. Even the character development is done is a beautiful and entertaining way. I though this was much needed as people were already used to Spider man story and the mentality needed to change and realize that ""Its not the same deal anymore"". That was necessary and it was done perfectly. If you have seen 500 Days of Summer, you know that Marc Webb is good at directing romantic scenes, he has used this skill to his advantage and he has done a great job of showing the romance between Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker...When it comes to performances, Andrew Garfield gets full points for being the best spider man in town... Not only does he look like spider man from the comics, his character was bratty and more vibrant than the ""Toby Maguire spidy"" which I really liked. Andrew is a good actor. I have always liked him since I first saw Boy A, thankfully he didn't fade into the void, Emma Watson playing Gwen Stacy the love interest of Spiderman really hit the bulls-eye. She looks gorgeous and lovable and she fits the role like a glove. The chemistry between the two is one of the high points of the movie... They look amazing together. Its a pity that Uncle Ben had to die in this movie, Martin Sheen fit the bill. The others did their job well. Its a better acted movie than all the first three Spidy movies. The second half of the movie is action packed with some tangible human spirit imbibed into it. There is one particular scene towards the end when Spidy is gravely hurt and the whole city comes to his rescue. It reminded me of brilliant ""train scene"" in Spider man 2, which is also my top spidy moment ever. Lizard as the villain was not as menacing as the previous bad guys in the Spider man Series, but a lot of the story is open for continuity and more villains are sure to follow. Also Lizard was not actually supposed to be menacing as he is still a good man gone bad due to a lab experiment gone wrong.Finally I would have to point out that this movie is made in 3D and they took advantage of our Superhero's maneuverability to a great extent. Some of the first person shots are breathtaking and feels like you are there with Spidy all the way.I would say this is my second favorite Spider man Movie after Spider Man 2. Its a slow movie no doubt but establishes the characters properly once it gets going it gets more entertaining. I am more than sure that the sequel will ""Go for it!"" from the start. A must watch movie for all Spider man fans. Truly ""Amazing""! Marc Webb Good job!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great film, my 9 year old loved it!","I will keep this short but after seeing all the other reviews I am very surprised at the negativity and tbh I think it is the usual resistance to change in a lot of cases.As a spider-man film, and as a Marvel/DC fan of over 30 years, I loved it. My 9 year old also came out thinking this is the best spider-man film yet, trumping the Sam Raimi ones, which while excellent didn't have the same amount of 'soul' for me.My best friend and his wife didn't want to watch this due to the negativity surrounding it, which is a real shame as I think they have missed out on a real gem.A 9 from me, the average of mine and my son's rating. :)P.S. I watched this in 2D as I find the vast majority of 3D films get in the way of the movie experience, Hugo being the notable exception.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It's like watching the first Spider-Man movie all over again, only this time with better lead actors but a less substantial storyline","Warning: this is not a superhero movie.Okay, I kid.There's a modicum of truth to it though, as ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is not the superhero movie you wished it would be.This is the fourth film that portrays Peter Parker and his alter-ego on the big screen and is a reboot of the Sam Raimi film series with Andrew Garfield replacing Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man.Fans of the original series were dissonant upon learning of Andrew Garfield's selection as the new Spider-Man, with some saying he's too skinny, or he looks too meek, and all that blah. Well guess what? Andrew Garfield made the character his own. He delivered the goods with his acting chops and boyish charm. Sure, he did not look as good as Tobey Maguire in his spandex suit, but his physical and emotional embodiment of the protagonist was more than enough to make up for a rather so-so physique.Likewise, Emma Stone used her all-American girl good looks and personality to give life to Gwen Stacy (previously played by the equally stunning Bryce Dallas Howard). Stone has the makings of a quintessential leading lady she could have given Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane a run for her money.On the downside, the most palpable shortcoming of the film is its superficiality. It's entertaining, yes, but there is hardly any depth to it. The plot is a lot more predictable than expected, and the characters are not well-defined, Dr. Curt Connors in particular.Given the groundwork of the first 3 films, I was sure that the script of this new series' first offering could be better. Alas, I was wrong. It comes as a surprise to me, knowing that Marc Webb did such a fantastic job when he directed ""(500) Days of Summer"" starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. Where he triumphed in the former, he failed in the latter. What's good though, is that Webb nailed the action on this one.Shooting from a subjective point of view proved to be very effective as it gives you the feeling of flying with the main character. You can almost experience that sense of velocity when Spider-Man swings through the streets, as if you've just been rescued by him. I bet it would be even more thrilling when seen in 3D (too bad three-dimensional graphics make me nauseous). If I may add, the visual effects, sound mixing and sound editing are outstanding, too.Now If you were to ask me which one is better, I'd still go with the original. Sam Raimi did a terrific job with the first franchise and remained loyal to the comic books. Nevertheless, you'd have to give props to this movie for trying to identify itself as a reboot, not a remake. It's pretty much a repackage of what we've already seen and what we have always known about our favorite web-spinning hero, so where's the untold story here? It's obvious that the studios are still trying to cash in from the millions of moviegoers who can't get enough of Spider-Man. Whatever the producers are up to – and I'm pretty damn sure that they're cooking up a sequel – it better be good.P.S.To those who intend to watch the movie, here's a tip: If you have seen other films based from Marvel Comics characters, you should know better than to leave the cinema as soon as the credits started to roll.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Andrew Garfield is excellent, film is otherwise kinda meh","Did I hate this movie? No, I really didn't. Andrew Garfield is incredibly likable and makes an excellent Spider-Man. But... it just really didn't grab me. The plot was fairly dull on a macro-level and the dialogue within the script was pretty bland. I would've loved to see Andrew Garfield's take as Spider Man with a better script. The visuals were fine (it's a superhero movie) and Sally Field is always fun to see, but not much else really is sticking with me about this film beyond Andrew Garfield's infectiously likable performance. Didn't hate it, but I won't remember it.Also, I have to say-I really couldn't get on board with the school scenes. The single least believable thing in this film (a film including a giant lizard monster and someone getting superpowers from a radioactive spider, mind you) is the fact that someone who looks like Andrew Garfield was a loser in high school. Nope. Kid would've called all the shots in my high school and many others. The man is a demigod and radiates that energy in any role he's in... which makes him hard to buy as a social outcast.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An amazing reboot to the franchise!,"So the start of Andrew Garfield's arc in The Amazing Spider Man (1 and 2). Now, this movie was truly amazing, Andrew Garfield makes a great Spider-Man, maybe not the best Peter Parker, but a damn good Spider-Man. Also, The Lizard? A very unique villain choice. It paid off except for the fact Lizard looks like a Ninja Turtle. It's action packed, it's funny, Andrew's Spidey has the best quips out of the 3 Spideys.

"My generations quintessential teenager life story, that is the iconic Spiderman","Many years ago, Stan Lee crafted a story with, perhaps the worlds most beloved superhero.

The story of a teenager, not extremely social (who really), smart, bullied, has to suffer loss of family (his uncle) and is to be how you want to.This interpretation of that beloved story is brilliant!

Fresh start,"The famous reboot of the franchise left few people satisfied at first. A new actor, a new costume - everything is new, and after Toby Maugaier, beloved by many
However, as time went on, the film was viewed and the impression became better. Much better, which left fans in two camps: those who embraced the change, the freshness of the franchise, and those who never strayed from Sam Raimi's cinematic Spider-Man canon.But only one thing can be said with certainty: the magical chemistry of Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, Spiderman, which really corresponds to the canons - this gives the films a well-deserved positive assessment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spiderman: Different and Dark,"Before watching this film, a fair number of people have told me that this film is bad and not worth watching. While I can understand the hatred of this adaptation of Spider-man, I don't really see it as so bad. The darker tone was a little jarring at first, but once the film gets underway, it isn't so hard to understand. The darker color costume fits the atmosphere while Andrew Garfield does give a slight ""teenage angst"" portrayal of Peter Parker, but it creates a more human character that doesn't feel as cartoonish or unrealistic as the originals. If there was one nitpick, it would be to not have so much of Andrew Garfield revealing his face during the film. Spider-Man's character has always been one to keep his identity secret, and having Peter show his face in almost every fight scene creates a disconnect. However, this movie wasn't completely awful and I would watch it again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but disappointment at the same time a look back,"Like many of you, I was skeptical when this reboot movie was announce. Rebooting Spider-Man movies is double edge sword, especially those Raimi Spider-man, which I grew up & have appreciations even move, still rules and still iconic. So when I saw the movie in theater & re-watching this again, the are still some pros and cons that this movie sill have even now.Peter Parker, on the trail of what happened to his disappeared parents, gets bitten by a spider, which lets him stick to walls: not as bad as what happens to Dr Curt Connors when he strays down the same scientific path, though. Peter has to negotiate a number of tricky obstacles in this movie - the disappearance of his parents, the death of his uncle, some fancy needlework, his new girlfriend (and her father, who wants to arrest him), school bullying, and a honking great lizard.I ought to have cherished this film. Andrew Garfield is a lot nearer to the adolescent Peter Parker as initially displayed in Steve Ditko's pencils than Tobey Maguire was, the secondary school foundation is appreciated here rather than dashed through, an interesting secret is set at the focal point of the film right from the beginning, Abrupt Conners' Reptile is both thoughtful and terrifying, the youngster sentiment among Peter and Gwen works, the exhibitions are altogether top notch (even Sally Field, absolutely miscast from an actual perspective, is great), the activity is stupendous, Spidey breaks astute, and a large part of the CGI is eminent (in spite of the fact that I wasn't persuaded all the time by the Reptile).One mayor aspect most people agree is Emma Stone Gwen Stacy, and the chemistry between Garfield's peter parker & Stone gwen stacy. The character Gwen is more likable than Mary Jane, mainly because Gwen personality is inspriration from Mary Jane in comic book & vice versa. Unlike peter & mary jane in raimi, this couple has move chemistry (maybe because they dating in real life & director has direct a romance films before ((500)days of summer) so it helps) & makes us care about them, want them be together; whereas romance between peter & mj kind of unlikable and roll the eyes whenever see them (at one point we care about them but writer drop out). Also the action sequence & the web slinging still hold up.So for what reason did I only like this and not love it? The biggest problems is the movie plays too safe and too rush at the same time. I don't believe this is on the grounds that it's too early after the first trilogy, in spite of the fact that I think the reboot component was superfluous: it consumes time and screws up the pacing. Much as I preferred Martin Sheen, I figure this story might have been told better with Uncle Ben currently in the ground. Pacing is certainly essential for it - there were places where the film invested energy letting me know things I neither needed or had to know when it would have been exceptional to have on with the story. Discussing which, having begun with a secret - which I would have been very glad to see sought after - this was actually dropped pretty from the get-go (to spring up again in a spin-off, most likely), which disturbed me. Indeed, this film was obviously set up as an opener and that, as well, aggravated me - the Lizard plot line was settled, however all the other things wasn't (alright, so it resembles the funnies!). And one more thing a lot of footage, especially in the trailer and deleted scene, should include in final film in order to make movies less feel inconsistent.So, a look back while this movie is quite disappointment, overall I still I enjoy it and have fond memory on it. I don't thing this movie deserve all the hate, especially people appreciate Garfield's Spider-man after No Way Home release. Maybe we should give this franchise a second chance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Underrated & Overhated,"Watching these after the Raimi films really exposes how the Webb films lacked a lot of heart and mistakenly chose to focus on the 'edgy' post-TDK/Chronicle comic-book approach. The first half of the film is really melodramatic, and it feels like the film does not organically reach any of the key Spider-Man story tropes but feels obligated to check them off for the sake of the origin story, and in a very familiar and effortless way.I love Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man, but I do not enjoy his performance as Peter Parker in this first film. He comes off more of a dick than an innocent and helpless guy, which Tobey was able to perfectly capture. The whole film is very 2010-ish in every aspect, which sometimes provides a nice feeling of nostalgia but other times does not help the film at all.I would have preferred if the entire reboot skipped the origin story, but not in the way the MCU Spider-Man films did, but in the way the Spectacular Spider-Man animated show did. It could have provided a fresh take on the character for the big screen, as well as even avoiding repeating similar story beats to the Raimi films after only five years.On a technical aspect, there is some great cinematography especially during the fight scenes, with the high-school library sequence with the Lizard being one if my favourite Spider-Man fight scenes on film. Other than that, everything else is a bit uninspired honestly, nothing memorable.My favourite thing about this film (and the sequel) is the relationship between Garfield's Peter and Stone's Gwen, and their unbelievable chemistry. I love how she has an actual role to play in the film that is organic to the overall story, and it tied up well with her father's arc and the ending.This film's a bit over-hated imo but I do recognise it's many flaws. An overall enjoyable film that gad the impossible task of following up Raimi's trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Good Reboot,"Next on my Spider-Man review series is the reboot The Amazing Spider-Man and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Peter Parker become Spider-Man and have to stop a new mentor from changing New York forever.Main Character
Andrew Garfield plays Peter Parker/Spider-Man and he is very good in his role. His Peter Parker is really different to Tobey Maguire's and it does seem like this interpretation of the character has been more modernised and it works pretty well. He is really great as Spider-Man, he nails the quips well and I think overall this is a different but effective showing by Garfield.Supporting Characters
Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy and she is really good, she is a fun love interest that doesn't ever annoy me. The chemistry is amazing on screen which is probably helped by some off screen chemistry, it really raises the quality of the film and it makes the whole romance angle of the film an actual joy to watch. Rhys Ifans plays Curt Connors/The Lizard and he is also decent, I have some complaints about the character but his performance is pretty strong and if given more attention this could have been a top villain instead of just a decent one. The late Irrfan Khan, Martin Sheen, Dennis Law and Sally Field are also all good in their roles and fit the world very well around the other three more prominent characters.Story
The story is good in terms of introducing us to a new Spider-Man and it does certain elements that are new and fresh in this world. I just wish it had leaned into these more focused instead of things that are quite generic or that we have seen before. This is a clear origin film and it just feels really rehashed, maybe something else could have been done to change it up or just have him be Spider-Man at the start of the film. Also Lizard's plan is just absurd and makes no sense, it feels underdeveloped and rushed just because the film needs a villain.Script
The script has some good one liners from Spider-Man, he feels funny and like you would imagine a young man as a new super hero would. But the drama is a bit of a mixed bag, the romance is good and I cared about it, but some of the other drama doesn't work. It feels like it isn't fleshed out enough and doesn't do enough to really make me care.Style
The film looks really good, Spider-Man's costume and swinging look fantastic and I really liked how it did the POV shots of him swinging as it felt like we were swinging with him in the rooftops of New York. But some of the action scenes didn't really hit with me and I wasn't a huge fan of Lizard's look in the film. The pacing isn't great either with the first act in particular dragging for me.Overall
Overall, The Amazing Spider-Man is a good film. If you are a fan of the character you will enjoy it but it could have maybe done a bit more to stand out.Rating - 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly good new take on Spider-Man,"When this movie came out I was ready to call it unnecessary because why would you need a reboot right after Sam Raimi's very good trilogy? How can there be any new ideas left?But it's surprisingly good. Maybe not quite as good as the 2002 movie but still better than average superhero flicks. The tone is this time a bit darker and more serious, but there is some comedy too. Many new fresh ideas are found. There is more emphasis on Peter Parker being a high school student, and also more sci-fi in the story. Mary Jane is not missed long because another iconic love interest is introduced - Gwen Stacy. Even though MJ is my favorite, Emma Stone is great as Gwen.I think it's a good comic book movie that can be recommended to Spider-Man fans.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Different comic origin that almost delivered a new motion comic book movie.,"""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a remake of the Sam Raimi classic from 2002.

The film is two and a half hours long and leaves a lot of unanswered questions.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Refreshing, entertaining, and engaging all throughout!","First, the thing that most impressed me about The Amazing Spider-man was its storytelling. If you think about it, it is actually pretty simple, but I thought that it was very effective nonetheless. The characters and sequence of events including the action sequences as well as emotional ones were what made up most of it.Second, the characters had more than enough depth and most of them were not your typical stereotypes. Andrew Garfield made for one interesting Peter Parker/Spider-man. He was great at bringing him out. He made for one weird Spider-man which was something refreshing. Awkward all around, yet decisive, agile, and funny. Unknowingly helping the villain, then obtaining his powers, and a little time later trying to stop him; all the while experiencing and dealing with human emotions. From the comments I have read, this is the Spider-man from the comic books. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was refreshing to see as well. I liked that this time around the love interest got more involved in helping the hero stop the villain. It made the story more layered and interesting. She was appealing and charming. The chemistry between them, by the way, was great. Probably the best chemistry I have seen between a hero and his love interest. Dr. Connors made for a great villain. Evil, but at the same time being able to show and keep his human side. The rest of the actors, Denis Leary as Captain Stacy, Sally Field as aunt May, and Martin Sheen as uncle Ben did awesome jobs as well. Even though they did not get as much screen time, they were great supporting actors who made the film more interesting and entertaining.Third, if you were expecting for the film to surpass the previous one, you will most-likely, at least, be satisfied. Like 99.9% most-likely. The Spider-man character was different, but without a doubt better. The love interest, Gwen Stacy this time, was definitely better also. In one phrase, she totally kicks MJ's butt, at least in the movies. I would not know about it in the comic books. The villain, Dr. Connors a.k.a. The Lizard, did not surpass the Green Goblin in his evilness, but it made for a more complicated and exciting plot and challenge for Spider-man. Other things like the visuals, directing, and special effects, especially thanks to the 3D, were better as well this time around. Story-wise, this time it was more complicated and layered, but executed with simplicity, which only helped the film in making it more engaging and entertaining. So years ago when Peter Parker was only a child, his parents went away and left him in the care of his aunt May and uncle Ben. A briefcase which Peter's dad left behind is discovered. It includes sensitive information about a biological project involving splicing reptile DNA and its properties with human one, which works to regenerate the human body; Dr. Connors is mentioned within it. Later Peter discovers that Gwen is working with Dr. Connors in his lab, and he also finds out that Dr. Connors is still trying to solve part of the project to finalize it. Then Peter sees that the solution is among the papers in the briefcase, and he shares the solution with Dr. Connors. Unfortunately Dr. Connors uses it on himself without enough research and trails, bringing side effects to himself such as super-strength, physical deformation, and a distorted state of mind. It is a temporal thing, working only as long as the regenerative effects last, but, after experiencing the strength and its power, he can not let it go, and convinces himself that this this is the perfect state for humans. So he starts this by trying to make all of the city like him. After Peter sees him and what he is capable of, he takes responsibility of it, thinking that he should because he helped to solve the project, and thus helped turn Dr. Connors into The Lizard. During the same time Gwen and Peter become closer, more than just friends. And she also becomes closely involved in trying to stop The Lizard from transforming all of the city. While this is happening Peter has also to deal trying to hide his secret from his aunt and uncle, and escaping from the police who have branded him a criminal, especially Gwen's dad, Captain Stacy.The film seemed a little slow at times, and when it was done it felt like a short movie, which is totally inaccurate as the film runs a little over two hours. For me this just means that the film was so good it kept me engaged all throughout it, so I did not think about the time.If you analyze it, It might not be the most packed and intense action superhero movie out there, however, not having the most intense in those things does not necessarily make it boring or bad. When there is no action to make it intense, the film is still very entertaining and interesting. Plus, for me characters and story lines are more important. The reason is that when there is no intense action on screen is when the story and characters develop. So when the action does happen it is made more intense not because it is actually intense, but because you are more engrossed in the story and because you care more about the characters due to those times in the film when there is no action. And this is exactly what The Amazing Spider- man does.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"it's okay, no more no less (depending on your point of view)","Once again we get the origin story of Peter Parker becoming the Spider-Man. Once again we get Gwen Stacy, though this time its a substantial character (something that even I'll say, as one of a handful of big fans, was a problem in Spider-Man 3). Once again we get a scientist who meddles too much into his own business and finds that what it changes him into is a living nightmare. And once again we have a teenager who can throw out the occasional quip - though Garfield's Parker is more jerkish in some of his comments than Maguire ever was - while taking out the bad guys, whomever they are. Oh, and of course we get to see (spoiler? no, not a spoiler, screw you, this is 50+ years old now) Uncle Ben dies. Derp.As I recall from watching this movie, the (must qualify here) first 'reboot/remake' of the Spider-Man franchise from Sony, on DVD right after it came out - I skipped it in theaters, probably I was too busy working that summer or something, I can't remember - is that this wasn't any crime against humanity, and it was probably more watchable and understood its world a little better than, say, Trank's Fantastic Four or the majority of something like Batman v Superman). Webb, pun intended, does a competent job with the character stuff involving Garfield and Stone, albeit I'd rather see them as a couple in a totally different film, so that one can excuse the action from being rote.At the same time, this also solidified my belief that, if movies last this long, we can go another, oh, 55/60 years before needing another Uncle Ben death scene again. Or, for that matter, Peter Parker in a skateboarding slo-mo shot. It's too same-old to stand-out from the pack, but full of too much personality to be a train-wreck or a fun disaster. It's a perfectly eh-OK-ish blockbuster, and despite this rating and a lot of game supporting players (Sally Field, Irfan Khan, Rhys Ifans... got paid I guess). I'll never see it again intentionally.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It is called amazing for a reason,"This film is about a young man who gained superpowers while trying to find out why his father disappeared years ago.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is what a blockbuster should be. The pace is fast, and there is not a moment of dullness. There is plenty of action scenes, and most of the scenes have amazing special effects. Even in 2D, I was astounded by the level of detail of the Spiderman swinging through skyscrapers in New York. There are comedic scenes that got the whole house laughing, and there are also spine chilling scenes involving heights. I like the emotional subplot very much too. The emotional connections between Peter and Gwen, and also between Gwen's father and Peter are well portrayed, that the film is moving me to the point of tears. I think ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is called so for a reason, and I enjoyed it so much.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Much better than the previous versions!,"Ok yes, we JUST had a few Spider Man movies when this came out. But that doesn't mean this one is not good. In fact, to me, it is way better than the 3 previous ones. It is more faithful to the comics and Andrew Garfield makes a better Peter Parker than Tobey Maguire. Too bad some of the special effects are not up to what was available in 2012.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's not 'Amazing' but it was probably worth doing.,"I love Spider-Man. I love the comics, I love the PlayStation games and I think the animated series that seemed to be on Fox Kids 24/7 back in the day is one of the greatest cartoons ever made. What I didn't love, however, was the Sam Raimi film trilogy. Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate them. For what they were, they were pretty solid and part two in particular was a thoroughly enjoyable little adventure. Unfortunately though, I could never take them to my heart. They weren't Spider-Man. Maguire wasn't Peter Parker, he was just someone doing a bad impression of him, and Kirsten Dunst most certainly was not the Mary Jane Watson I knew and loved. Therefore, when I first discovered that this reboot was happening, I was really quite excited. I hoped and I prayed that it would do away with everything Raimi got wrong and bring the real Spider-Man to the big screen, after over forty years of waiting. 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is by no means flawless, it's the closest thing yet to a truly amazing' Spider-Man film.The biggest problem with Raimi's trilogy was that the vast majority of the people in it had been woefully miscast. In complete contrast to that, Andrew Garfield was quite simply born to play Peter Parker. I've always loved Garfield and I was sure he wouldn't disappoint here. I was right. He gets it down to an absolute tee. The social awkwardness, the cute nerdiness and the dark emotional baggage that has become so symptomatic of Peter Parker over the years is on display here in abundance. From his nervous little ticks, to the facial expressions, the walk – heck, even the conversational style – Garfield IS Peter Parker. Similarly, Emma Stone is great as Gwen Stacy and the chemistry between the two sparkles throughout. Furthermore, the characters themselves are great. Marc Webb, as director, does try a teensy bit too hard to hammer home Peter's troubles, but for the most part it works. Gwen isn't the damsel-in-distress that Raimi's interpretation of Mary Jane turned out to be. She's an active player, she's fun, she's feisty and she's a great counterbalance to Peter's bouts of recklessness. Peter and Gwen are instantly likable to the point that watching their relationship unfold and develop really is a joy. The supporting cast and characters are solid too, and Webb does his best to flesh them out a bit, even going so far as to give Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka) a multi-faceted personality, instead of the two-dimensional jock Raimi gave us. I must give special credit to Sally Field too who, in my opinion, dazzles as Aunt May. I liked Rosemary Harris' portrayal of the character in Raimi's films but felt that the character herself was totally wasted. Here, Aunt May is put to some decent use, as is Uncle Ben whose relationship with Peter, despite his relatively short screen time, is explored in a fair amount of depth.However, the film doesn't come without its problems. The plot is, for lack of a better word, silly. Admittedly, it's highly enjoyable and makes for a very entertaining two hours, but it doesn't hold up to much scrutiny at all. There are far too many coincidences and conveniences helping it along and it therefore all seems a tad ridiculous. One particular plot device (involving cranes – look out for it) would even give Spider-Man 3's 'emo Peter' a run for its money in the cheese stakes. Having said that, the origin story is executed brilliantly and there are some great laughs to be had as Peter starts discovering his abilities. Yes, it takes a while to get going but solid performances and a good script stop things from becoming tedious. The themes that run through the film (and, one would assume, its sequels) are interesting and Webb succeeds in creating an aura of mystery that is genuinely quite exciting. The background story of Peter's parents and Oscorp industries is handled well and a number of foundations are laid down for a potentially exhilarating set of sequels.Now for the main problem with the film and, considering this is a superhero film, it's a biggie. Spider-Man is handled brilliantly. Everything that people had expressed concern about, such as his use of 'web shooters' or the fact we'd have to go through the whole Uncle Ben murder thing again, is handled creatively and with care. The film's villain, however, is not. The Lizard (played ably by Rhys Ifans) is not the most interesting bad guy in the World. There's not a whole lot that can be done with him and, whilst Webb tries his best, the character can only go so far. The change in personality, for example, rings quite false and the dodgy CGI is quite difficult to swallow. Ifans is good as Dr. Connors and the character's background is explored as much as possible. Unfortunately, it's a thin background and there isn't a great deal to work with. However, the action sequences are entertaining enough and the fact that Spider-Man is portrayed as amateurish and weak against such a monster gives the film a pleasant twist. We genuinely get the feeling that Spider-Man could lose this fight. At the end of the day, he's just a schoolboy and, as such, it's ludicrous to paint him as a skilled strategist or fighter. By having him rely on the help of other characters to succeed, Webb manages to keep the character grounded, which is a very good thing.Overall, is a country mile better than 'Spider-Man 3', has a much more interesting origin story than 'Spider-Man' and is, by the strength of its performances, marginally better than 'Spider-Man 2'. As a reboot, it's promising and was well worth doing. I only hope that the sequel is able to build upon the themes laid out here without becoming too unrealistic or contrived.Oh, and the Stan Lee cameo is hilarious.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Perfect Blend of story/plot, good acting, & fight scenes w/Bad Guy","Man that's an excellent movie. The acting is so much better than the original Spiderman movies with Tobey Maguire. The new Peter Parker is 10 x's a better actor than Tobey Maguire. I enjoyed the Avengers movie but the Amazing Spiderman's plot works much better to me and the story-line just seems to pulls you along effortlessly and keeps you intrigued and interested at the same time. It's the great blend of story/plot, good acting, and action-adventure and fight scenes with the bad guy. As far as comic book movies go, this is one of the better ones. I think it's most definitely better than the last two Spiderman movies and probably better than the first one but not by too much.It is worth the price of admission to watch this movie and it would be a great movie to take your kids since their isn't anything crazy happening in this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazingly confusing Spider-Man,"This is a movie with a rather tragic fate. Trapped in the Sony's basement for a long time, it got lost in the shadows of both Tobey Maguire and Tom Holland's portrayals of the character. It all changed when No Way Home was released in 2021, which shone a ray of light on this forgotten movie.At the time of its release The Amazing Spider-Man was received rather mildly. And watching it a decade later I also had some mixed feelings. It's like a pendulum - it swings back and forth between some genuinely amazing decisions and some rather awful ones.On the positive end I can greatly appreciate the dark aesthetics of the movie. When Spider-Man first appeared in comic books, he was seen by many as a rather creepy character. In this context, the darker tones of the movie make a lot of sense. This aspect also finds its way in the choice of the main antagonist - the fearsome Lizard, a scientist with great intentions in mind and a victim of his own experiments.Moreover, speaking of comic book inspirations, this movie takes some elements from the Ultimate universe, which appeared in 2000s and absorbed qualities of its own time. Some characters, as well as story elements, were taken from it. In this regard the movie seems like a pretty unique and creative combination of both old and new elements of the huge Spider-Man lore. It even makes some innovative choices that defy expectations.A recipe for a timeless classic for sure.I can also praise certain specific characters in this movie. For example, George Stacy , a police captain and a great family man. His character is well characterised and is surprisingly deep, which you can't help but admire.Finally, the visuals, the bread and butter of the superhero movies. Nothing to complain about here. The scenery is great and the costume design is superb.Unfortunately, now it's time to discuss some of the questionable aspects. For me a lot of this story's problems can be summed up as such - the sheer lack of consequences for protagonist's actions. Which pretty much goes against everything that Spider-Man as a character represents. With great power comes great responsibility, but only when it's convenient to the writers. It's possible to point out quite a few scenes where the viewers expect some kind of consequence, a retribution for the action taken. But the movie just writes it off as a joke or just ignores it. It happens once, it happens twice, and your immersion is ruined. Instead of dealing with certain problems Peter Parker will just shrug them off. Earlier I said that some characters here can be praised. Well, on the opposite end, others were ruined by this very aspect described here. For example, aunt May exists as a mere butt of the jokes, completely invalidating her care and worries for Peter. Moments like that really take you out of the movie and greatly lower you overall enjoyment.Overall, I wish the story was given more time to develop. Sometimes you can see some orphaned story beats, which appeared in the trailers, but are absent in the final cut. A little more time in the oven could've helped.All in all, it's not a very bad movie - you can spend a peaceful evening watching it while preparing for the massive MCU crossover. But it's hard to recommend it as an individual piece, since the story seems so much unfinished and it goes against a lot of things that the character is loved for.But oh well, the fans of Captain Stacy will be happy. Yeah, all four of you.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
better than the original?... i think so,"A 2012 reboot of the original Sam Raimi spider man movies that I think is miles better. Andrew Garfield makes a better peter parker/spider man in my opinion he looked the part, had the right personality and acted it out perfectly where as Tobey Maguire I thought was too geeky and shy with not much personality.unlike the original this movie stays completely true to the comic, his first love is Gwen Stacy played by the amazing Emma stone who is fantastic as always but in the original they had Mary Jane which is wrong because peter didn't meet Mary Jane until after, when peter starts turning into spider man he makes a web shooter out of cartridges but the original just had it coming out his wrists and the villain was the same in the comic being the lizard played by Rhys Ifans who did a fantastic job he played both personalities of good and bad superbly compared to the ridiculous green goblin who was just awful.all the CGI and effects in this movie are faultless and top notch, they took total advantage of all the technology we have in this day and age and the whole movie was so well made and looked stunning, the design of spider mans costume was great, the camera work on the swinging through the city shots were superb and the lizard was scarily life like the whole entire movie makes the original look lame and outdated completely.in conclusion only bother with the amazing spider man not the originals and look forward to the sequel in 2014.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Visually grand, with great CGI and sound effects, great soundtrack and costumes ... but there's a lot of work to do in everything else.","Following in the wake of the ream of comic heroe movies that DC and Marvel have been promoting, this film is just one more, and addresses, as it has been done before in the cinema, the iconic figure of Spider-Man, a one of the most remarkable and famous cartoon heroes ever. He has originated, at least, one trilogy (around 2000) and has now been recycled to make a few more movies, and a few million dollars in profits.This movie, like many others, tells how teenager Peter Parker became Spider-Man, with all the moral and psychological conflicts associated with such a radical transformation. However, we have seen this so many times that it was difficult to show anything substantially better without changing the character's story, which would be sacrilegious. So the movie just shows what we already know, selects a powerful villain from the long list of enemies the character has accumulated over decades of comics, and gives us the decisive confrontation between them.Andrew Garfield is a decent Peter Parker, but I confess he hasn't always convinced me. He has some annoying face movements, but he does what he needs to do. Emma Stone looked a lot better to me, but this wasn't the movie for her to shine. So she just made a good romantic match, having a good chemistry with Garfield. Rhys Ifans is equally good as a villain. Martin Sheen and Denis Leary also did well.The film is directed by Marc Webb, who seems to have done a decent job. The problem is that he didn't bet as much as he should on creating a good story and developing characters and the work of the actors. The concern was, from the beginning, CGI and visual and sound effects. And, in fact, on this issue, the movie is excellent. It's a visual show from start to finish, with sweeping New York views, great costumes and photography and immense camera movement, which gives a feeling of speed and agility to Spider-Man, who flies and jumps like never before. Soundtrack is also excellent, as epic as you'd expect in such a movie.I think the movie loses a little compared to other movies with other characters. It is not a movie that stays in memory, or can be said to be grand or excellent. Good dialogues are missing, a handful of more complex and developed characters, a more interesting and less trite story. It's a good and entertaining movie, has good production values, good actors and is visually spectacular, but that's basically it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Fresh and Exciting Take on a Classic Hero,"The Amazing Spider-Man is a reboot of the beloved superhero franchise, and it breathes fresh life into the character of Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Andrew Garfield shines in the lead role, bringing a new energy and depth to the character that is both refreshing and compelling.The movie follows Peter's journey as he discovers his powers and learns to navigate the complexities of being a superhero. The story is engaging and well-paced, with plenty of action and humor to keep audiences entertained.Director Marc Webb has done an excellent job of creating a visually stunning movie, with action scenes that are both thrilling and inventive. The special effects are top-notch, and the 3D version of the movie is particularly impressive.But what really sets The Amazing Spider-Man apart is its focus on character development. The movie takes the time to explore Peter's relationships with the people around him, including his love interest Gwen Stacy (played by Emma Stone) and his surrogate father figure, Uncle Ben (played by Martin Sheen). These relationships are complex and nuanced, and they add an emotional depth to the movie that is often missing from superhero films.Overall, The Amazing Spider-Man is a must-see for fans of the superhero genre. It is a fresh and exciting take on a classic hero, with a strong cast, engaging story, and impressive visuals. Whether you're a longtime fan of Spider-Man or a newcomer to the franchise, this movie is sure to entertain and delight you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Raimi with Garfield = what it takes to be Amazing!,"Andrew Garfield has more charisma than Tobey Maguire. That i will say. Seriously would Raimi green-light this film, i doubt it.The movie hangs by a working screenplay and acting.Spiderman is supposed to be about Spiderman being Spiderman, kicking villains bad ass, swinging all over the place,While i do not wish to compare this to the other blockbuster spiderman films. The Amazing Spiderman title tends to be misleading the fans of the spiderman franchise. Why wasn't anyone working on this film sensible enough to simply make it what it is ""Spiderman""Amazing is definitely not the keyword here. While you may find this movie worth your bucket of popcorn. Sadly the high standards of direction set by Raimi is unreached. He was able to sell Tobey Maguire as Spiderman! And here you have Garfield as perfect Spidey, and go play hopscotch with the plot.So much could be accomplished with Spiderman films. A good film you feel like watching more than once.

Admirably Spun,"When it was announced that a Spidey reboot was in the works, most people responded in the same way (namely, by groaning and emphasizing their contempt for Hollywood and it's lack of originality). Likewise, I thought it completely unnecessary to start from scratch, as Sam Raimi and company had crafted an admirable trilogy (the third installment being a take-it-or-leave it experience). With The Dark Knight Rises on the horizon and The Avengers having ruled the first half of the summer movie season, it seemed as if Marc Webb had accepted a fool's errand in attempting to spin a tale that, by all accounts, didn't need to be retold.Lo and behold The Amazing Spider-Man, an origins tale that's a much darker, more brooding take than its 2002 counterpart. This time around, Peter Parker is played by Andrew Garfield. Unlike Mr. Maguire, this Parker has a tangible chip on his shoulder. He's a moody teen who vividly recalls the day his parents dropped him off at Aunt May and Uncle Ben's so his scientific genius father could sort out a mysterious mess at Oscorp, only to never return. Peter has inherited his father's knack for figuring out how things work—albeit in a more mechanical sense —and, though introverted, is clearly a clever kid in his own right. As new insights about his dad's work come to light, Parker finds himself in the labs of the fabled biogenetics lab that his old man helped build. It's then that he is—wait for it!—bitten by a mutated spider.As you can see, the basic layout of The Amazing Spider-Man is very similar to what transpires in Raimi's feature. One key difference, however, is the decision to focus on Peter's father. This helps motivate Peter to embark on a quest to discover ""who he is,"" which ultimately leads him to the realization that his dad's intentions were noble. Another significant difference here is the tone; Webb and Garfield remove the slapstick comedy that made the original (the 2002 original, that is) a colorful, light-hearted affair. In its place is a decidedly more drab depiction of the Big Apple and its inhabitants, and— for my money, at least—a more compelling vision of how Parker comes into his own as the web-slinging hero of yore.So, even though there are plenty of familiar elements, the movie feels like a more mature take on Spidey that causal moviegoers and more ardent web-heads can both admire and appreciate.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I didn't expect that it would be that good,"How little you need for a good movie about Spider-Man! I definitely see some work here and love to the main character, that I didn't notice in most MCU movies. I would still say that I like Homecoming a bit more, and it's Spider-Man, though I rated both movies as 7/10(to me Homecoming is the best movie about spidey, though I consider Far From Home worst movie about spidey it is like 4/10). Furthermore, I liked serious tone and direction a lot in this movie. More or less, I liked the epic. I can say for sure, that my favorite Spider-Man and Peter Parker is Tobey(along with Mary Jane), that my favorite and overall strongest scenes all in Tobey's Trilogy(cause it really touching and dramatic) but the best movies are Homecoming and this one(I didn't see TAS 2 yet). I would rate this old trilogy 6/10 in general and all the movies 6/10. You can read my review on my page about SM1 and SM2, so I should only say what I think about SM3: it is partly boring full-time action movie, but well done technically(great contrast with SM 1 and 2) and still has emotional good moments, so overall kinda the same in quality. I think that people mostly didn't like the third movie because of their own impressions and emotions, but not because of rational reasons. If you think that 7/10 is low rating, for the movie that I admire a lot, then I'll tell you that rating from 8 to 10(of nearly 300 movies and shows that I've watched) got ~ less than 10%. 7 is really rare too, and it means that it is either really interesting/unconventional or solid. Moreover, there is a family movie Die Wilden Kerle and I'm absolutely in love with it and I can't say that is has cons, but I gave it 6/10 rating. If say it short, my movie rating system based on its complexity and quality. 7 is the max rating for movies that I didn't really consider pieces of art. What's the conclusion? This movie is recommended to each and everyone. Surprisingly, even cliché didn't spoil it. Ah yeah, I just as Homecoming I rated Iron Man 7/10, and Deadpool, and Glass too. As you can see, I didn't give priority to one movie over another just because of its tone, theme or pretentiousness. All different movies, all left different impression and I like them all.

Andrew had the wise crack of Spider-Man because if you read the comics or watch any of the cartoons, you'll see Spider-Man as a wise cracker and as Peter Parker, he has nerdy, but he is more than just a nerd. He was also a teenager who had friends. Emma Stone was a much better romantic lead than Kristen Dunst. And I thought the action was much better than the first Spider-Man.

Emma Stone, Martin Sheen and Denis Leary all give really good supporting performances. Rhys Ifans is a really good villain with mostly believable motivation.Marc Webb's direction is fantastic, the film feels extremely practical, probably more than it actually is and the action sequences are well shot and enjoyable.

An average reboot that just didn't do it for me.,"I have only seen The Amazing Spider-Man a couple of times. I remember seeing it the first time and being kind of ambivalent on whether I liked it or not. But as a guy who watches films I like many times I just rarely revisit this one. I have to admit I love the Sam Raimi Spider-Man films and had a sort of disinterest in this one from the start so it did have a strike against it. It had been 5 years since Raimi's Spider-Man 3 and even though it was a mess and many were disappointed by it I have always felt that it was unfairly panned. It was not nearly as bad a some have said. So only 5 years later come this complete reboot. Complete with another origin story explaining how Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man.This is not a shot for shot remake of the earlier Raimi films. Peter Parker is played by Andrew Garfield this time and his take on Peter Parker/Spider-Man is different from Tobey Maguire. Garfield plays Peter as more of a slacker with sort of an attitude as opposed to MacGuire's take which was Peter as a put upon geek. Garfield is fine but I just like Maguire's take better.The film deals in more detail with Peter's parents and their disappearance. His relationship with his Uncle Ben and Aunt Mae played by Martin Sheen and Salley Field. The film puts more emphasis on their relationship and the performances are fine but it gets tedious and drags the film down. The villain is Dr. Curt Connors played by Rhys Ifans. He eventually becomes The Lizard. He is the antagonist to Spider-Man. Connors is trying to find a way to regenerate human limbs with lizard DNA. Eventually he becomes The Lizard and of course he and Spider-Man duke it out. There isn't much more than that. The performances are good but the story is just a slightly different version of the Raimi origin story that is just too familiar and not as compelling. This film is competently made but it offers nothing new or memorable. The action scenes are ok but there is nothing distinctive about them. Competent but forgettable action. That is the biggest issue with this film. There is nothing about it that sets it apart or tops the Raimi films. The shadow of the Raimi films looms large here. It's not bad in any way, but it's just average. Nothing sets it apart.Grade: C.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

We Can See Why It Should NOT Have Been Rebooted So Soon,"There were so many reasons why I was ready NOT to like this movie. First of all, the original Sam Raimi-Tobey Maguire trilogy was so recent, and were done very well and did so well also box-office-wise. I did not really feel the need to make this reboot at all, much less, too soon after the ""Spider Man 3."" I was also very leery about the choice of Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider Man. Watching the trailers, I do not know what it was about Garfield's face and body build that did not seem right to be Peter Parker. Anyway, the hype was still really building up, as evidenced by the grand first day showing today in almost 100% of cinemas all over the country. Of course, it was inevitable that my whole family will still go and watch!As it began by telling Peter Parker's high school life, you see that Director Marc Webb was trying so hard to make it different from the first Tobey Maguire movie, and this can be noticed as the movie went along. The story of how Peter was bitten by the super-spider was so far- fetched and unbelievable. The story of how Gwen and Peter became a couple was so rushed. The story of Peter's parents which was what I thought would be a main theme in this movie was hardly tackled in detail at all.Andrew Garfield painted a different Peter Parker than Tobey Maguire. Garfield made the role his own by amp-ing up the angst. I have to grant that Andrew was a better dramatic actor than Tobey. His scenes with veteran actors Martin Sheen and Sally Field (as Uncle Ben and Aunt May) were heartfelt and sincere, as with his romantic scenes with Emma Stone (as Gwen Stacy). However, he seems to become schizophrenic when he dons his Spider Man costume, as he becomes all too cocky for comfort.Emma Stone acted very well as Gwen Stacy. She was a much better love interest than Kirsten Dunst was as MJ in the first movie. I guess it was because Gwen was written to be smart and courageous, unlike MJ who was nothing more than a mere damsel in distress. Rhys Ifans does an effective departure from his usual comedy roles to play the tragic Dr. Curt Connors. It was just too bad that the story of his descent into Lizard madness was too sudden to be affecting or logical.Admittedly, there were so awesome-looking visual effects in this movie. The cartoony multi-color palette of the Tobey version was replaced by a darker and more serious mood in this one, more fitting into the Marvel canons. Overall though, while the effort was there but the final impact of this film could eventually be forgettable. Even the extra scene in the end credits hinting a second installment was predictable. After watching, all my three kids declared that they liked the Tobey version than this. Ultimately, we still remember the Tobey Maguire films too much for this film to take any serious roots into our memory. Let's see if the next installments will make a difference.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Sorry to say but this movie left me mostly cold.,"First of all, it was of course totally unnecessary to reboot the series again already. They might as well could had simply made this movie as a ""Spider-Man 4"", that way we wouldn't had to sit to another origin story, that besides isn't getting told as a very good or interesting one.And that is the foremost problem of the movie; I just couldn't really ever get into it. It didn't always had a very pleasant flow to it and things didn't always progressed and developed very natural. Things just happen and you have to take a lot of things simply for granted.There were plenty of things that bothered me about its story and storytelling. I for instance never bought into the whole romance between Peter Paker and Gwen Stacy. I have no idea what made them fall in love and what made their love so powerful or unique. Like I said before, it just happens but there is never really any notable chemistry or anything about it that makes you root for their love or make you feel and believe that these two persons belong together.The movie also does quite a poor job with all of the character's motivations. There is no good reason for Peter Parker to develop and put on a suit and swing through the city, trying to catch criminals. There also really wasn't a good enough reason for Dr. Curt Connors to turn into a super-villain and there was even less reason for him and Spider-Man to become enemies. With this I mean that their story lines aren't really interconnected good enough with each other and Spider-Man so easily could had decided not to get involved and not to get his life at risk, since it wasn't like he was being an established superhero in the city already, who everybody relied on. Another reason why this movie would had been simply better, had it been done as a ""Spider-Man 4"", instead of as a fresh start to the movie series again.It's a shame this movie failed to make any emotional impact on me since this obviously was the approach the film-makers were going for. A more personal and dramatic Spider-Man but the movie just really didn't had the right script for that. Even the whole uncle Ben storyline totally left me cold this time and so did the relationship between Peter Parker and aunt May, which always is an important aspect about the Spider-Man franchise, in my opinion.And for goodness sake, stop recycling your own music so much, James Horner!It of course remains a far from bad movie but there is nothing about it that stands out or make this a memorable or unique movie within its genre. It does absolutely nothing new but it of course does still provide some entertainment. I still did wish there was some more action in it at times though. But Peter Parker doesn't really become Spider-Man until halfway through and Dr. Curt Connors becomes the Lizard even much later on in the movie. It therefore takes a while for the action to truly kick in but when it does, it's all quite and fun to watch but overall the movie remains underwhelming, in about every way imaginable.Also can't say that I was very fond of the casting. Andrew Garfield never gave me either a Peter Parker or Spider-Man vibe. He feels miscast in my opinion and I definitely won't mind at all if he gets replaced with another actors for the next movie. As a matter of fact, I doubt I will even notice it, since he's so incredibly unremarkable in his role and I doubt I will recognize him on street, even now, when I have just finished watching this movie. He isn't being very likable or charismatic enough in his role.It really doesn't do or bring anything fresh, original or great to the series. Weak as a reboot and very mediocre as just another modern superhero movie.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very well made,"I'm not a huge fan of the Spiderman films and I had heard little or nothing in regards to this one from friends and colleagues alike.However the movie was I think better made than the previous versions of the character. Purists will find holes in some of the explanations of the character and his abilities if they compare it to the other movies, but better to take this movie on it's own merits rather than comparisons.I found the acting was very good from all the players and the filming had a very classy feel to it, the effects were enjoyable and not over the top. Above all there was a good sprinkling of humour from the character punctuated with good timing throughout the movie.Andrew Garfield played the part very well and surprised me with his clear acting abilities,Denis Leary is as good as always.It felt like money well spent picking this one up!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing indeed!!,"I saw this on the first day (July 3rd) and was really surprised. I thought it would be hard to top the other first three Spider-Man films. I also thought Spiderman's new look was better. Andrew Garfield was actually really good. I didn't expect his performance to be that good. The movie was also very funny at some points. It was a little more realistic than the others because he didn't actually have web shooting from his arms. He had little devices that he strapped to his arms that shot web. The Lizard looked very realistic. I read that the actor for Dr. Curt Conners/Lizard had to wear a piece of cardboard over his face. I don't how they made it so real, though. Anyway, I really enjoyed this more than I thought I would, and I can't wait for the Blu-ray release! AWESOME FILM",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A beautiful mess..,"I remember watching this for the first time when I was a bit younger and I really enjoyed it but now coming back and watching it again it doesnt feel right, it probably has a couple of favorite superhero moments but was diminished with bad writing and awkward directing.Solid story with some flaws and an ok pacing. Alright dialouge though a bit cheesy at times. Good acting. The visuals, choreography, and effects were all good. Though the Lizard's design was just garbage. The characters were alright as they were pretty much the same from the comics.Overall an enjoyable flim..but it is a wild card for some people.

"A  teenage hero movie which more serious than all those ""grown up"" Avengers","When you reboot a story, there must be some necessary stuff which should be included in the previous version but completely left out. So the reboot version should give better perspective about the hero or his story.I'm not Spider-man comic fans but I watch all Sam Raimi's film including Spider-man. And I still feel that his version does not need any reboot.The film itself is developing quite slow, it's like a Disney teenager movie when a teen slowly building his rapport throughout the film and become somebody but in very serious way. It's more about Peter Parker than Spider-man, which I think could be speed up since it's become boring in 2nd half due to its darker tone and very serious ambiance.The film itself is quite decent but nothing extraordinary. And I still like the Sam Raimi's Spiderman because he seems more fun.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not bad, but not needed.","After the train wreck of Spider-Man 3, the powers that be decided it was time for a complete Spider-Man reboot. The vast majority of the audience asked the same question: ""Why?""Regardless, here we are, The Amazing Spider-Man. OK, you all know the story. Say it with me:""When bitten by a genetically modified spider, a nerdy, shy, and awkward high school student gains spider-like abilities that he eventually must use to fight evil as a superhero after tragedy befalls his family...""...and straight away we have the biggest problems with this movie.Firstly, it's not clear who this movie is aimed at. Everyone who knows anything about Spider-Man knows spider bite + dead uncle = Spider-Man, but this movie really seems to drag it out anyway. It's a Spider-Man movie that will at times make Spider-Man fans hit the snooze button, but there's not much in it to attract a new audience either.Secondly, they get the story wrong. I know, I know, Marvel has many universes, etc etc, but it still just feels... wrong...Peter Parker isn't nerdy. He's a teenage Bart Simpson, complete with skateboard. Sure, he gets bullied and he understands science stuff, but he still comes across a little like an idiot who has managed to get hold of an answer sheet.Then we have the new secret agent conspiracy surrounding his parents. This is the big new hook, the whole purpose of a reboot, the story arch that will keep us glued to the trilogy... but who cares?Spider-Man should be about an ordinary kid, dealing with ordinary life while simultaneously realising that ""With great power, comes great responsibility"" (or the much less catchy paraphrasing used in this film). The parent conspiracy just takes away some of the purity of the character.That said, it's not that bad a movie. And it does explain the mystery of why Spider-Man always seems to have somewhere to swing on (save the child of a crane driver and you're sorted for life).But, as expected from a series that just didn't need another origin movie, it feels pointless.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The untold story? Not quite, but a well-told story? Definitely.","After Spider-Man 3 became something of a critical and commercial letdown and plans for a sequel fell through, the folks at Marvel Entertainment and Columbia Pictures developed a case of itchy reboot button syndrome and immediately put The Amazing Spider-Man into production to swing in and save the franchise. Many fans rolled their collective eyes and the web was abuzz with fiery opinions. Early looks and promotional materials seemed generally underwhelming, and the film quickly became buried by bigger releases such as The Avengers, The Dark Knight Rises and Prometheus. However, this spider has become something of a dark horse and has somehow risen to greet detractors with a shot of webbing to the face.In spite of the poor first impressions, one would be hard-pressed not to admit that The Amazing Spider-Man is actually a competently-made, enjoyable flick. The approach that the aptly-named director Marc Webb of (500) Days of Summer fame took brings to mind last year's surprise hit Marvel flick X-Men: First Class, in that in combines the youthful appeal of teen drama with relatively large-scale super heroics and action sequences. This film does not repeat the mistakes of Spider-Man 3 – instead, we have character development and interaction and clear and easy-to-follow plot progression.Spider-Man has always been a hero all readers could relate to, with his transition from outcast to hero and his various personal, real-world struggles. Andrew Garfield, sexy nerd incarnate, is an ace casting choice. The actor has said that playing Spider-Man has been his dream since he was a young boy and the role went to the right guy. Garfield has an effortless, genuine charm and his slightly lanky proportions do seem very reminiscent of the Peter Parker of the comics, particularly the Ultimate version. For all the strengths of Tobey Maguire's interpretation of the character, Garfield's somehow rings more true. Whether he's being a smart-mouthed do-gooder, a teen sorting out his issues with his well-meaning aunt and uncle or a young lover unsure of how to go about a relationship with his dream gal, Garfield is in great form.Speaking of his dream gal, Emma Stone does a similarly good job of playing Gwen Stacy. Many were confused after Stone was cast and then announced as playing a different character from Kirsten Dunst's. Gwen did pop in Spider-Man 3 played by Bryce Dallas-Howard, and is touted as Parker's first love. In an interview, Stone states that ""Mary Jane fell in love with Spider-Man, but Gwen Stacy fell in love with Peter Parker"". Gwen is smart, kind and funny, surely what every guy looks for in a girl, and her role in the story is just the right size. Sure enough, the chemistry between Stone and Garfield is among the strongest of on screen couples in recent memory and it's no surprise that the couple continued their romance off the set.One has to feel bad for Dylan Baker who portrayed Dr Curt Connors in Spider-Man 2 and 3 but never got the chance to transform into the Lizard after the cancellation of a fourth entry in Raimi's series. Rhys Ifans fills those shoes, and he marshals a tragic figure who hopes to better society and to fix his own perceived physical flaw. This definitely will push the excellent actor further into public consciousness, and he does a decent job. However, Connors' split-second snap from rational scientist to raving mad supervillain does seem a tad rushed and the design of the Lizard, as has been stated before, is pretty goofy. Also, the relationship between Connors and Parker, while given some attention here, could have benefited from a little mo re.The rest of the supporting cast is good too. Martin Sheen is easy to buy as the earnest, down-to-earth uncle and father figure who serves as an upstanding role model to his nephew, and so is Sally Field as his concerned, protective wife May. Casting these veteran film industry stalwarts was certainly a good move, especially since this retelling doesn't particularly focus on the two but does convey their involvement in Peter's life. Denis Leary is also well-cast as the Inspector Javert-type Captain Stacy, who could have been an over-the-top, ""squash Spider-Man dead!"" figure. Instead, Leary makes him a stern but well-meaning authority figure and gives him a good dynamic with his daughter and Peter. His resemblance to Willem Dafoe, aka Green Goblin from the first Spider-Man film, is a little distracting though.In terms of aesthetics, the movie looks sleek and dramatic – director Webb uses his ample experience shooting music videos in the right way. While it could have been something like the horrid Catwoman movie, there is instead clever use of lighting and composition and the action sequences are kinetic yet coherently-shot. This reviewer isn't a giant fan of the costume, produced by the people at Cirque du Soleil (really) and the afore-mentioned facial features of the Lizard. The large amounts of digital effects supplied mostly by Sony Pictures Imageworks (also responsible for last year's Green Lantern film) are also a cut or so below expectations for a big-budget superhero movie, but these don't significantly hurt the end result.The film brings up the issue of Peter's parents but never fully addresses it, with a slightly ham-fisted mid-credits sequel hook hinting at what is to come. The Amazing Spider-Man has been marketed as ""the untold story"", which is rather bold given that it's only been ten years since Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and five years since Spider-Man 3. Still, it defies expectations and is thoroughly entertaining. Untold story? Not quite, but well-told story? Definitely.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but not good enough","This movie shows loyalty to the comic books and is presented well. The choice of cast, sets and props are also spot on.However despite these good factors I still feel that the franchise being rebooted was unnecessary. Despite the fact that the change of directors was inevitable, it would only be wise to keep the same continuity however still create a new era. In my opinion if a franchise is to be rebooted it needs to be done so in a completely new tone and a slight differ in origins. The best example to use is the Batman franchise being rebooted in 2005, gave us a totally new perception of the character and story.In comparison to both movies, I do prefer the transformation from Peter to Spider-man. I also think that Peter's parent's back-story was also much more interesting than the previous movie.Overall this movie was enjoyable and I think Andrew Garfield done a splendid performance, however it did not give of the same charm as it's preprocessor.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Unnecessary, though not necessarily bad","A re-boot of a series that only started a decade ago, and ended just five years ago. As such, it feels unnecessary and probably a tad rushed. It has to go through all that origin story stuff again, and, in my opinion, that's almost always what kills comic book movies, especially ones where I'm already familiar with the origin story (Batman Begins, despite being very well liked, has never worked for me either for the very same reason). It also doesn't help that James Garfield, who has proved himself a really fine actor elsewhere, feels weak as Peter Parker. He just never seems like he could be a super hero. Tobey Maguire really surprised me as being capable in the role, but Garfield doesn't. The film does get better as it goes on, especially after the super-villain, the Lizard, is created (played by Rhys Ifans). Before the classic accident that turns him into the Lizard, Ifans is kind of dull, but the actual Lizard monster is truly an imposing villain and actually kind of frightening. The action sequences are pretty good, though both Spider-Man and the Lizard are CGI creation. It thus amounts to simply watching cartoons fight, but it's well done for what it is. Emma Stone has good presence as the girlfriend, Gwen Stacy. Dennis Leary plays her father. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are Peter's Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Sheen's good when he's around, but Field has no presence as Aunt May.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Totally enjoyable competent and been there before...,"The Amazing Spiderman (2012)What do you do with a movie that's impeccably well made, acted to the pitch required of a superhero movie with realistic themes, and filled with really fluid wow factors? I mean, this is a really compelling movie on some levels. And if you like these kinds of movies (and there is no shortage of them every year) this is one of the best, technically, and from the point of view of unaffected acting.What no one wants to say or hear in this context is that the movie isn't everything it could be. Or even worse, it's everything that other movies have already been, including earlier Spiderman movies. Marc Webb isn't at fault--he directs with aplomb, and gets the most from the series of action scenes. It's the writers, and the producers who are guiding the writers, who have to take some rap in presenting another movie about the same kind of thing we've seen too too many times. Or at least too too many times for me, for singing praises.But if you don't mind the formula again, you'll be in for a treat. I know I enjoyed it all even so. The swinging through space, the life or death fights with a hugely powerful monster, the last minute race to stop the doomsday device (with a timer to let us know exactly how much suspense lies ahead), the girl who is smart and pretty and actually pretty capable, too. All of this is in place, and well done.Well done. Is that enough? Up to you. It's hardly the kind of movie the invites deep thinking or parsing out the components.

It's Spider-Man for the Twilight generation,"I was eager to see how they'd tackle rebooting this franchise particularly since the 2002 version from Sam Raimi was such a great success. Could they better it, or would they make a total hash of it? Turns out neither, really.It seems the writers must have been fans of twilight or some other type of modern day adolescent girly slush, because instead of focusing on the core themes of Spider-Man (which has driven the character since the 60s), themes of Power, responsibility, alienation, loneliness, revenge...instead we got highlights from a Taylor Swift music video. Misty eyed, star crossed lovers, going all wobbly lipped with Coldplay songs in the background.The action scenes, as you'd expect, were very well done - even if the story was a bit ham-fisted and rushed. It was entertaining enough and great to see spidey swinging about the screen again, dipping around skyscrapers. Unfortunately when you compare it to other superhero films of the last couple of years, it doesn't really stack up.

Action scenes are magnificent but story takes too much time developing Spidey's past...,"Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone make a likable enough pair as the teens who find themselves in a heap of trouble once they learn that Dr. Curt Connors (who transforms himself into The Lizard), intends to make huge trouble for the unsuspecting denizens of the city.It takes an hour for the story to start unwinding at a faster pace, once we learn about Spidey's parents leaving him to live with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben (Sally Fields and Martin Sheen). But once bitten by a spider, after a forbidden excursion to an experimental lab, the story leaves some of the character development behind and takes off once Spidey discovers his power of web flights and his ability to deal with school bullying.Garfield never seems quite as vulnerable in the role as Tobey Maguire, but there's a sensitivity necessary for the more intimate scenes. He handles the action scenes well. Rhys Ifans does a commanding job of histrionics as the scientist whose regeneration of lost limbs transforms him into The Lizard, with spectacular effects.James Horner's score is very effective at capturing all the thrills and excitement of magnificent photography and the special web effects are all any CGI fan could ask for, even when seen in 2D.But there's an obvious discrepancy between the rather ordinary script and the magnificent special effects that will leave some disappointed that more time wasn't spent on the script itself furnishing a better story treatment.The whole thing is stylishly directed (especially in the action scenes) by a director with the apt name of Marc Webb.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Felt Like Watching a Comic Book! Give it a Real Chance,"Really enjoyed this film. Obviously, this is a different take on Spider-Man than Maguire's or Holland's version. However, I don't see anything wrong with this version of Spider-Man. Honestly, I think this film is superior to the Maguire films; especially taking out of consideration nostalgia. First, the special effects are far superior in this film than they were in all 3 Maguire films, combined. Second, the story telling was way more in-depth and fully realized. The creators drive into Peter Parker's parents story/history. They give Aunt May & Uncle Ben a more relatable and fully realized story. The focus on how Peter Parker creates/becomes Spider-Man in a more ""real"" way, by showing him creating the web-shooters and costume using ""real life resources"", instead of in Maguire's version how he just magically made it himself with no comprehension to the audience why or how and the nonsensical bodily web-shooters lol. The relationships between the actors/characters feel organic and natural, and not at all awkward or forced like in Maguire's films. It truly felt like watching a comic book on screen rather than watching a big-budget Hollywood movie try to fame a beloved hero. This film felt like a DC/Batman movie at times, but not in a rip off way just coincidental way. Andrew Garfield gets a lot of slack for being the ""lesser"" Spider-Man, but honestly he was fantastic and played the character well. All of the actors played the characters well. I would strongly recommend giving this movie another chance and try to separate it from the nostalgic Tobey Maguire ""Spider-Man"" films.

"Webb's Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does what ever a Spider can","The Amazing Spider-Man is directed by Marc Webb and collectively written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves. It stars Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen and Sally Field. Music is by James Horner and cinematography by John Schwartzman.Peter Parker (Garfield) was orphaned as a boy when his parents were killed in a plane crash, raised by his Uncle Ben (Sheen) and Aunt May (Field), he is a clever lad but something of an outcast at high school. While investigating the disappearance of his parents and sporting a crush on class mate Gwen Stacy (Stone), Peter's life is tipped upside down when he is bitten by a radioactive spider that gives him abnormal powers.While the Spider-Man franchise doesn't (thankfully) come packaged with the kind of bizarre mania that comes with Batman, the acolytes are a tough bunch to figure out. Sam Raimi's trilogy garnered close towards $2.5 billion worldwide, yet now, with this reboot (actually it's a reimaging) trundled off of the Sony production line, there are plenty of ""fans"" coming forward to say they never rated Raimi's films! Magurie was this, Dunst was that, Raimi missed the beat of the comic version of Spidey and etc and etc. Well I'm sorry, but I just don't remember any fall out apart from the near unanimously agreed upon over stuffing of Raimi's part 3. Perhaps I just didn't go on the right Spider-Man forums? But even then it's hard to argue with a box office take of $2.5 billion, those figures have to be made up of a good proportion of Spidey fans, surely? You would reasonably thinkI mention it because The Amazing Spider-Man has met with reviews from each end of the scale. Those at the high end who support the ""reimaging"" seem to focus on it being close to the real Spidey universe they wanted, with great casting, better effects work and a origin story of worth. At the other end is the arguments that ""reimaging"" a film that is only ten years old is daft, especially since it actually doesn't bring the promised new direction or origin story of worth. In fact it just juggles bits of the Raimi trilogy and plays it out with other Spider-Man characters instead. While Garfield is hardly an improvement since he's way too old for high school as well! The truth is that Webb's movie falls somewhere in between both sides of the argument, and that's not just me being Switzerland and staying neutral!Negatively it plays out as a compromised production and not the film that the makers initially set out to make, there are too many dangling threads and haphazard edits that leave narrative gaps. An Important character disappears off the radar, other characters are given limited time to breathe, and crucial plot points are arrived at with stupendous leaps of logic. A coda spliced into the end credits tries to entice us for the sequel, suggesting that the quick wipe over the origin ""origin"" story was deliberate, it's unlikely, and feels like an afterthought. For a film that purports to be putting its own stamp on the Spidey universe, it quite often makes you think of Raimi's films anyway. It may be The Lizard instead of Green Goblin and Gwen instead of MJ, but the emotional and psychological beats are still the same. Reboot? My arse. Oh and Horner, who I'm normally a fan of, has turned in a score that lacks vim and vigour, it aspires to be full of swirling superhero fervour to raise the goose flesh on your arms, but instead it's just goose, and not a decently cooked one at that.However, on the positive side of things, low expectation really helped me to enjoy the film, and I even watched it a second time to check over some initial reactions I had. There is still a lot to enjoy here. Acting is of a high standard (Ifans' performance as Curt Connors gets better on repeat viewings), with good chemistry generated between Stone and Garfield, the effects work is (obviously) better ten years on; something which gives us a better-more acrobatic-moving Spider-Man, while the whole make-up of Parker as a geek who becomes cocky, even arrogant, really adds a kick to the first half of the movie's coming-of-age narrative bent. It's also good that with a running time of over two hours the makers have the time to expand Peter as a character, making the audience wait with expectation of his life changing date with the spider. As for the villain, it's true enough to say that The Lizard is hardly an inspiring choice, but it does fit in with the whole origin story plan that Webb and his team want to tell. Though it should be noted that those seeking wall to wall fights between Spidey and The Liz are going to go a little hungry.It's big on human story and not the lazy cash in movie it could have been, and undeniably it's fun, but the holes, dangling threads and logic leaps stop it breaking out to achieve its intentions. Looking forward to the sequel, mind 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Except for the Title there is nothing ""AMAZING""","Many of us loved Raimi's spidey and then came a reboot. Everyone expected it to be like the Batman Reboot but it wasn't even close to the Spider-Man 3. The plot is exactly the same as Raimi's and even the villain's characterization.As the movie goes on we feel like watching a Remake instead of a Reboot.Emma Stone is pretty as always,Ifans does a clean job and there's this guy who tries to convince us that he is Peter parker. The cinematography is really awesome and refreshing while the story and screenplay is pretty much dull.I guess James Vanderbilt,Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves forgot to add some ""AMAZING"" screenplay.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A good reboot of the Spider-Man franchise, but keep your expectations in check","So it's an annoying pattern for me with some of these summer films. They mostly go like this: a so so story, average acting at best and great special effects/action. That's pretty much what we have here. I wasn't expecting much going in given as I felt like they just finished making the original trilogy and this film was somewhat unnecessary. But after the debacle that was Spider-Man 3, it was probably inevitable. Truthfully though, my low expectations were met.First of all there are some tweaks to the story, but that's to be expected of a reboot. Some changes I liked, some I didn't. For the most part, they stayed true to the story line you'd expect. However, it was a bit formulaic and the themes were still fairly simple and somewhat childish, but it's a comic book film, so I can't get too upset about that, right? Well, not exactly. I know, it's just comic book movie, but The Dark Knight has spoiled me, I'm sorry. I'm still hoping for a bit of a darker tweak to the franchise at some point.The film definitely got better as it went along, much better. The first third of the film did feel really rushed to me a it seemed they wanted to very quickly setup the known elements of the origin story to get to the action and later story arcs. Kind of surprising, I mean, I think we know the Spider-Man story at this point don't we? But I digress. It was was over the top in a number of ways. The soundtrack was over done and pushed the sentimentality a little too much for my liking. And it was also way too cheesy, I had a few too many ""oh come on"" moments. Particularly one that was just so over the top I gasped, but it's one the young ladies in the theatre loved; it was both romantic and incredibly cheesy.Andrew Garfield was definitely a solid choice, he clearly felt much more like Peter Parker than Tobey McQuire did. He was very shy, awkward and a little troubled, staying true to the Peter Parker we've seen while effectively improving on those performances. I'm curious now to re-watch the original trilogy to see how I feel about him in that role after seeing this. He and Emma Stone are cute together and much more likable than Tobey and Kirsten Dunst were (especially Dunst, who I found annoying). The film had a childish playfulness to it that I enjoyed and found authentic and this was directly because of them. Martin Sheen and Sally Field were also good in the limited roles they had.The high point of the film were the special effects, hands down. I loved the Lizard, easily the best visualization of him I've seen to date. He was very sinister and a little dark. Also loved the voice over work done for him as well. Didn't really care much for the Rhys Ifans pre-lizard character however, felt he was not as compelling as Alfred Molina's Doc Oc. Spider-Man looked fantastic, the effects for him have clearly gotten better, much better. Given the new bar set here for special effects, I can't wait to see what they do with Venom later in the series.Now having said all that, this was fairly entertaining. The fight scenes were very impressive and well choreographed. It definitely had a genuine comic book and cartoon feel to it and I thought was cool in a nostalgic kind of way. It reminded me very much of the Fox afternoon Spider-Man cartoon I used to watch back in my early high school days. So definitely credit there, as I don't think any of the original films did this for me to this extent.I was however baffled by the rapturous applause it got at the end in my theatre. I can't remember the last film that got that much applause, to be really honest (not even The Avengers got that). Was it good, yes. Was it deserving of that kind of applause, no. But then again, I'm a bit snobby I guess, so to each his own. In a nutshell; it was enjoyable and I look forward to the rest of this series with this improved cast. But the standard for Spider-Man movies remains 2004's Spider-Man 2.http://www.themoviesnob.ca/@the_movie_snob",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Spiderman yet!!,"Okay, I had high expectations for this movie, and let me say that it exceeded those expectations. The story is perfectly done, the cast played there parts very well (especially Garfield and Stone ), the action was very well done and the score is absolutely astonishing. Seeing this made me excited for the sequels coming in the future. I can tell that the ""Amazing Spiderman"" movies will continue to get better and better. I am loving the different take on Spiderman. Andrew Garfield is the perfect choice for Spiderman. Now don't get me wrong, Tobey Maguire was a good Spiderman, but there was several things wrong with him. 1. Was his size. He was just too buff to be Spiderman. I know this is a stupid reason, but it's a reason none the less. 2. His tone was too monotone at most points. Those are just a few. Garfield embodied all that was needed to be Spiderman. Now, as everyone should have been able to tell, the cast had incredible chemistry with each other. Not saying the cast of Raimi's trilogy didn't have chemistry with each other, but the cast in this movie just worked and flowed with each other. That is one of the key things in making a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
the 'not so' amazing spider-man,Went with high expectations since this is the first spider-man movie i was going to watch in a theatre.All 3 versions earlier i saw on TV or DVD.The first half is very very slow n boring.In fact Andrew Garfield as spider-man doesn't suit at all.The film becomes a little watchable close to 2nd half when that big creature enters.But the film is so predictable.No twists .The actions scenes were good to watch.But the romantic angle which was also a vital part in the earlier spider-man movie is missing.The new spider-man is just too kiddish.Even the action scenes weren't that good.The problem is that this movie is coming after 3 very good spider-man movies.This makes the expectations sky high. And people who will go with high expectations will get disappointed.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Your Average Big-Budget Action Movie,"Let me preface this by saying that if you're a Spider-Man fan, or a mid-pubescent male, you will enjoy this movie. I'm neither, but I can objectively say that this is not a ""must see"" film. However, I ended up seeing it twice and shucking out about 20 bucks in the process. I got what I expected. I just didn't expect very much at all.I'm not a huge superhero fan, but some friend's wanted to see it, so I tagged along. Occasionally these sort of movies pleasantly surprise me, as was the case in The Dark Knight. Unfortunately, this movie is exactly what I expected; a few hours of thrilling action shots and engrossing fight scenes.Like most films of this genre, the story line was sub-par, but they managed to pace it rather well. On the other hand, the screen-writing was actually pretty horrid. It featured boring and stereotypical scenes, corny wisecracks, and was really repetitive in some parts. Sometimes these repetition really took away from the advancement of the story line, which made an average story broken and disconnected. It just didn't come off as a very well put together movie.But I'm not going to sit here and act like I have some exceedingly delicate movie-viewing pallet. I enjoyed it for what it was. Like I said, the action and special affects were entertaining, and the chemistry between Peter and Gwen (Garfield and Stone) really shown through out the entire movie. The characters were also well rounded, the only thing that keeps me from putting a price on the writers heads. Even the bully and the villain were real people.The saving grace of this movie: How good looking the lead actors were. As a guy, I can say that Emma Stone looks kind of hot as this sweater-wearing high school intellectual. And the ladies were probably all over Garfield. So good job Marvel! You can't hire writers, but you can hire hot actors!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Reboot of Marvel's Spiderman; good film experience, not brilliant","I enjoyed this film in so much as it was fairly exciting, interesting and the SFX were good, excellent in fact. I didn't mind the CGI, which is a good sign, it didn't annoy me, except I did wonder how much Andrew Garfield was actually IN the film. The character of Peter Parker did annoy me though; whilst watching I got sick of his selfish uncommunicative mooning around, I often wonder how quickly problems would be sorted if people just said what was going on. He was too fashionably good looking and intelligent, and a skater, to be the subject of such excessive bullying, and too confident, to my eyes, so didn't really cut it as a geek as well as the quiet and mousy Tobey Maguire in the role. That saying I really liked him, I felt he was believable in the character once he changed and how he dealt with it. The previous boot of the film had Spiderman finding his webtastic skills as the way he adjusted, and likened to adolescent change, whereas this skirted back to - I am led to believe from what I've read -the original Spiderman using technology to spray his webbing but this showed a similar transition in his inability to control his powers and strength, and so therefore perhaps his anger and mood-swings too. I preferred the emotional range of Garfield in the role. I'm sure Marvel fans will comment more knowledgeably on why there was a reboot and the authenticity of this one, but I was mainly hung up on a few things, that I saw as inconsistencies and imponderables that I found a little irksome which I should have just suspended my disbelief over.The pretty and wide-eyed Emma Stone was typically great, I like her a lot, and in this she was sensible and mature in her role. I loved Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen), he was such a lovely character, as was Sally field as Aunt May, Peter's surrogate parents since his parents disappeared, and whilst I understood his anger and angst towards them, I didn't like it - but then you're not supposed to are you? The family brought the characterisation more to the fore in this adaptation, I think, so his anger etc did was it was supposed to; create a roundness to the titular hero. Rhys Ifans never ceases to amaze me as I always associate him with his character in Notting Hill and he's always so different, like a chameleon... also a Lizard! Great seeing C. Thomas Howell again as Jack's Dad, so I predicted we'd see him again as otherwise he was in too small a role, at least I would hope, and Captain Stacey (Denis Leary) as Gwen's father, was ideal as a comic book square-jawed Law enforcement hero, and I like him in most things I've seen him in, he has a dry authority which worked well. Overall an enjoyable and emotive film with a great score, atmospherics and performances. The teaser cliff-hanger in the credits - make sure you don't miss it - nods to obvious suspicions from the start of the film. Certainly an entertaining film experience, and I'd probably go see the sequel as it's got Emma Stone in again and maybe Jamie Foxx, which should be fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brings a new level of emotional depth to the Spiderman franchise,"I know some of the reviews of this movie so far have been hit and miss, but I personally thought this was an excellent film.I saw one of the pre-release screenings and went in without great expectation as I loved the first Tobey Maguire movie and didn't know what another re-boot could really bring to the character.Firstly the casting is spot on. Andrew Garfield completely embodies the character. I thought Tobey Maguire did a job but Garfield puts him to shame in this movie. Emma Stone was absolutely fantastic as Gwen Stacey Other reviews have asked if this supposed to be Spiderman movie or Twilight, and yes I agree that the film concentrated a lot of energy on the character development and the relationships.I do not see that as a bad thing. Daredevil was not the best movie I have ever seen by any stretch of the imagination, but it made me feel an emotional connection to the characters in a way that many other superhero movies do not. The Amazing Spiderman takes that to the next level.If you are just looking for blockbusting action and fight scenes from start to finish then no, this movie will probably not deliver for you. However if, as a fan of comic books, you are just as interested in the lives and the motivation of both the heroes and the villains and seeing them have to deal with the same emotional issues that you do, no comic book movie has done it better.Go and see this movie! If you haven't seen a superhero film before because you think it isn't your thing, see this one! It brings something new! Not for everyone I guess, but I loved it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Too amazing for words,"Every aspect and detail of this movie was perfect. Many of the scenes I just had to watch again before I keep watching. There's just too many things to praise and highlight. Actors casting and performing was too perfect. Their performance was so real, it felt at times you were actually witnessing real life. The chemistry between Garfield and Stone was unreal. I wouldn't be surprised if they actually fell in love off set. Marc Webb did a truly unbelievable job. He captured all the wonderful aspects of the story, characters, plot, dialog, and action. There's just too much to say.I just want to thank everyone who had a part in this movie.

Infinitely better than the previous outings! It's why we have reboots!,"There is no comparison really.This movie when compared to the previous Spiderman movies far outshines the old Tobey Maquire movies.Where to begin.The acting...they used real actors. When Spidey gets the crap kicked out of him, you feel it. You see blood, you see wounds and bruises. Not the kind that Tobey got where 2 seconds later he was all better. It felt more real. Andrew Garfield is a Superior actor over Tobey. Sally Field, Martin Sheen, and Emma Stone completely surpassed their previous incarnations, however I felt that the Aunt May character and Gwen Stacy character were a bit underused.The truly wonderful thing about the movie is, the lame humor of the past is gone. There isn't a Russian landlord chasing Peter for rent. And Peter doesn't feel like a whiny, little girl like Tobey portrayed him. For instance in those movies, in all three he screamed like a girl when hit.The story was solid, but not strong. They had it in the right direction, but I think they needed to build on a few things. I didn't buy the main plot of the Lizard. OK..whatever but I was thinking...really? The story was still good enough to be called good and by far the best of the Spidey movies.Fight scenes, Spidey web slinging through the air, and the CGI all great. No complaints there.The chemistry between Peter and Gwen, they have what Tobey and Kirsten Dunst did not have. They need to seriously expand on that in the next movie. The man is what drives the hero. They need to get the balance right, and they need to develop his relationships a bit more.One of my main gripes of the old movies was that in every one of them the other characters insisted on calling Peter by both his first and last name, all the time. Peter Parker this and Peter Parker that. It was ridiculous and nobody talks like that. Sadly they did carry that into this movie as well. Although without quite the hokiness of the others.They need to keep a sense of realism. Don't get silly with it. Make dreams come true and not just transfer the dream to screen. I want to believe that its possible that a man with spider powers can fight a giant lizard man on a tall skyscraper. Which they did pretty well in this one.It is absolutely and completely worth your time to go see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Slightly-Amazing-Yet-Ultimately-Impotent Spider-Guy.. vs. a Lizard!,"With better editing and more sweeping soundtrack, the film could have been epic. Instead, it mostly fell flat; even in spite of solid direction, writing, and performance.Sam Raimi always brought the audience into his world and taught you how to truly care about what was happening within the silver screen. Here, it just felt like a 2012 rehash of something we've all seen before, but now, care less about.As an avid fan, I always hated Raimi's mutant web-shooters; so the induction of Parker's technical genius into this series marks a welcomed return to the source material. In addition, the filmmakers did an amazing job at capturing the sardonic tragedy that is at the core of Spider-Man's reality. Without Raimi's camp-humor, this tone was even more ever present.Stone, Garfield, Leary, and Ifans gave it their all, and it was enjoyable. The clash between The Lizard and Spider-Man was certainly nothing to the scale of Batman vs. The Joker, but was enjoyable nonetheless.Unfortunately with the film's pacing and unengaged soundtrack, things felt sluggish and tired: two things you never want to experience in a superhero action epic. In this regard, The Amazing Spider-Man was more of a Slightly-Amazing-Yet-Ultimately-Impotent Spider-Guy. I look forward to the sequels and how they are going to bring in the Goblins. There were some really interesting plot points teased throughout the film.7/10, would watch again - though it could have easily been a 8-9/10 with improved post-production work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing movie that stayed very loyal to the comics!,"I went to the midnight premiere for the Amazing Spider-Man........WOW!!!! I did not like the trilogy because of the lack comedy and tie ins from the comics. I also had great doubts about this movie. But all was good, no...AMAZING! Andrew Garfield was an absolutely drop dead outstanding choice for Peter Parker. I didn't see someone try to play Peter Parker, I saw Peter Parker. Emma Stone was also a wonderful, important part of the movie. Rhys Ifans as Dr. Connors was absolutely brilliant and his transformations as the lizards could not be any more creepy! Marc Webb owned Spider-Man with the fight sequences and web slinging. The best Stan Lee cameo of all time. Webbs version was overall way better than Raimi's depiction!

Garfield not the right choice,"If I hadn't have seen the original Spiderman trilogy I would have probably rated this movie higher, but I have so therefore I can't help but to compare it. In itself, this movie is good- Emma Stone played the part very well and the plot line was believable for a 'comic book' movie. The problem is that I don't think Andrew Garfield was the right choice for the lead role; he is a good actor as we saw in The Social Network but something was just missing for me, lack of Peter Parker quirkiness?The plot line was believable as I said but also predictable - there were no interesting plot twists and I found myself getting bored in the talks bits, the dialogue between the characters could have been written by a 9 year old! I understand that not all action movies need to have action 24/7 in them, but honestly, this needed more! There were only a handful of decent action sequences and most of them were pretty short. All in all I was disappointed leaving this movie, I will see the sequel and hopefully Garfield will have stepped up to the role.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The origin of Spiderman again.,"Marvel wipe the slate clean to reboot their Spiderman franchise after the dreadful mess that was Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3. This time around, it is Andrew Garfield playing teenager Peter Parker, who develops incredible spider powers—super strength, acrobatic skills and the ability to climb sheer walls—after being bitten by a genetically modified arachnid. When his Uncle Ben is shot and killed by a convenience store thief, Parker builds himself a pair of neat-o web-slinging devices, makes a natty outfit, and goes looking for the murderer. Meanwhile, one-armed scientific genius Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) creates a serum designed to regrow his missing limb, but which accidentally turns him into a hulking great CGI lizard in the process.While this reboot isn't quite as terrible as the third Raimi film, neither is it good enough to warrant starting things all over again. The script fumbles the origins of Spidey and feels utterly contrived (Parker being able to build web-shooters thanks to a handy synthetic material invented by Oscorp, student Gwen Stacey working part-time at Oscorp, those crane drivers helping Spidey to swing across town, Gwen rustling up an antidote to Connor's serum in a matter of minutes), Andrew Garfield proves nowhere near as likable as Tobey Maguire in the role, and Mark Webb's direction leaves a lot to be desired: I didn't care about any of his characters and his forgettable action scenes are over-reliant on unconvincing CGI.I have yet to see The Amazing Spiderman 2, but the fact that the character is getting yet another reboot in 2017 just goes to show that this particular incarnation isn't doing the trick.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Amazing Spider-Man Isn't Amazing At All.,"When Sony Pictures decided to reboot the Spider-Man franchise, I wondered if there really was a need for it considering that not much time had passed since Spider-Man 3 came out & overall, this franchise hadn't fared as worse as others to justify a reboot. Anyway, The Amazing Spider-Man tries to bring on screen the story of our friendly neighbourhood from its origins. Everyone must already be aware of the premise but in case you're not, it tells the story of Peter Parker & how he became Spider-Man in addition to an ugly, stupid villain thrown in here who is more funny (unintentionally, obviously) than scary.Director Marc Webb tries very hard to take his movie away from Sam Raimi's versions but it ends up with too many similarities in events, much less charm or excitement & is a dumbed down version of the original Spider-Man movie in a new package. Plus, the romantic arc between Peter Parker & Gwen Stacy is just absurd & eye-rollingly cheesy. Cinematography is more oriented to point-of-view shots while editing is just horrible. Visual effects feel incomplete & the music by James Horner is simply no match to Danny Elfman's magnificent score that actually feels like belonging to Spider-Man.Coming to the performances, Andrew Garfield is very much believable in the costume of Spider-Man & does a brilliant job in portraying the recklessness of a teenager in possession of newly discovered superpowers. Emma Stone is a darling as Gwen Stacy but she isn't given much to play with yet manages to tag along with a fine performance. Rest of the cast is simply forgettable. Also, Irrfan Khan's ""pivotal role"" was; to be used as the poster boy for the film's marketing in India, which actually paid off as this movie had a record-breaking opening here.Now those who are still reading this review & are unfortunately fans of this film, few of them might argue that I should not compare this film with the original Spider-Man but if that's the case then what exactly was the point of making this film if it never was going to be better than its decade old version anyway? On an overall scale, adding nothing but only a new dimension (3D) which had its little moments, The Amazing Spider-Man isn't amazing at all & is just no match to Raimi's versions, which are more fun even today. In short, a needless reboot whose needless sequel is coming soon. Good luck, Sony Pictures.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A more teen-adult, edgier, darker, better spider-man movie.","As a boy I loved the first Spider-man movie. It got me hyped! It got me obsessed with Marvel comic movies. Then the second film came around and it got better. The third...well...I liked it. When I heard they were making a reboot I got furious. But when I took some time to calm down, I figured I should give it a chance. It was WORTH IT! This makes up for all the faults the trilogy had and the effects were top-notch. Granted, the effects in Spider-Man 2 got better, they even got an Oscar! But the trilogy was cheesy. But it was marketed for kids, it's suppose to be. This film was more for mature audiences. I loved Danny Elfman's score in the first two movies but when I read James Horner was composing this movie I got even more hyped. And yes, the score rocked. The acting is solid, the action is awesome, the casting is perfect, the villain is NOT over-the-top like Goblin and Doc Octopus which is better; it's just the right superhero movie we needed. It did Spider-man a justice. I will pay to see the future sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Maguire move over... Here comes Garfield!,"When the publication of rebooting the Spider-man franchise from scratch instead of progressing on with the Toby Maguire/Sam Raimi trilogy, there was a distinctive scepticism surrounding Sony's announcement. Considering the first of Raimi's Spidey outings only hit the screen a decade ago, some documented Mark Webb's -take on the Marvel phenomenon as being too premature.Arguably every Spider-man fan, artist and costume owner would compare Andrew Garfield's character in relation to Toby Maguire's disposition. Garfield is much more compelling; intriguing to watch and his physic characteristically reminds us of the Peter Parker in the original comic. He carries himself with a professional tone, knowing how to express emotion and anger in a believable manner, unlike Maguire's freaky Gothic outtakes and inarticulate voice tone. Garfield's twenty eight years of maturity celebrates his ability to act like a teenager but with a distinct level of ripeness, helping Mr Parker become an attractive persona beyond the red mask.The story at times seems a slightly hurried, especially during Peter Parker's transformation from geek to freak in an outfit. But this is fascinating and very articulate on the director's behalf. Even those beyond the audience are conscious of Parker's difficulty to fit in, how he foolishly becomes victim to one of Oscorp's radioactive spiders and so on, yet Webb changes the shade of our hero to a remarkable effect. Rather then studying his new spidey techniques, Webb's adaptation introduces Parker's sudden change with a hint of laughter, causing collisions and confrontation by mistake, overly sticking himself to things and being a little over-aggressive without intending to do so. The element of surprise here keeps the interest with Garfield's volatile persona.The sequel to Webb's refreshed wall hiker could be enormous in comparison to Raimi's filming. Webb has the delight of deconstructing Raimi's trilogy and pick-pocketing every blunder, potentially turning it into a polished and expansive trilogy that may be difficult to emulate if Spider-man is to continue at the movies in future.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Mixed feelings, but a good movie overall","The Amazing Spider-Man is a reboot to the superhero film series owned by Sony and not related to any other Marvel films out there. This film comes out a decade after the original Spiderman but my feelings are mixed whether I should review it as a stand-alone, or as if it was better than the one that came out in 2002.The film, as with any first entry on a superhero film series, deals with the origin story of Spiderman and how his life changes dramatically after the usual ""radioactive exposure event that gave him superpowers"". Like I mentioned before, I am not sure whether it would be fair to compare this movie to the first one since they're kinda in the same levels of quality, but the original cast is naturally more likable for me and most of the audiences.In my opinion, Tobey Maguire is a much more likable Peter Parker than Andrew Garfield. Andrew's performance was quite juvenile and refreshing, yet he does not really look like a ""high school nerd"" that Parker is supposed to be. Andrew did succeed in performing more joyfully than Tobey, which made the film's tone less dramatic, and while he is wearing the Spiderman suit he seems to be having more fun than the corrupted Peter in Spiderman 3.The film's cinematography is great and overall I think the cast is on the same level like the original film series, although anyone is obviously more used to the first. The Lizard is the villain on this film, and Rhys does succeed in making his role work, although I was slightly disappointed he didn't have a ""crocodile-like jaw"".On other comments of the cast, Gwen Stacy didn't look too different when it came to her portrayals by Emma Stone and Bryce Howard. I am not familiar with Denis Leary's work in Rescue Me, but I actually believe his animated sabertooth counterpart Diego was a lot more expressive than his performance in this film. Peter's new adoptive family was well cast, and supported the film when it came to comic relief at times.Overall, the film is quite good, but I am unable to tell whether it was better than the first Spiderman. This film's tone is less dramatic and more cheerful, making it more appealing to the younger audiences. Truly worth to watch it if you're interested in comic book adaptation movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One word. AMAZING.,"WOW. The Amazing Spider-Man is just that. AMAZING. All around great movie I liked it way better than the other Spiderman movies and glad they did a re-boot.

Emma Stone was also good and they have good on screen chemistry.I usually don't like 3-D too much but this was way cool, especially the scenes where he flies through the air using his webbing.

A totally un-original and basically unneeded movie. A reboot that has nothing different from original. I say B-.,"""If you could do good things for other people you had a moral obligation to do those things. That's what at stake here, not choice, responsibility."" After mysterious circumstances causes Peter Parker's (Garfield) parents to leave him with his aunt and uncle he is left to wonder what happened. Now in high school Peter is still wondering why. After meeting an old friend of his father's he begins to think he may have an answer and helps him with a scientific equation that has very, very bad side effects...for all involved. I was never really a big fan of the Sam Raimi ""Spider-Man"" movies. To me they were too cheesy. I was looking forward to this one because it seemed darker then those. While this did feel more grown up it was still nothing like I was expecting. I think my big problem with it is that it was so much like the other series that the movie didn't feel like it was needed at all. This isn't a fair comparison but the Chris Nolan ""Batman"" series was much, much different from the Tim Burton series that the re-boot felt fresh and original. This one just felt like...hey let's do ""Spider-Man"" again...OK. This may just be my opinion but there is nothing new and fresh in this movie compared to the others and to me that seems like a waste of a movie. This again though is a movie that people will watch regardless of any review written, but just so you don't get your hopes up don't really expect anything different or amazing. Overall, if you liked the other series then you will probably like this one, since it's basically the same movie. I give it a B-.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Truly Amazing,"I don't want to say that this was better than the 2002 Spider Man, I think they are both good in there own right, this film does things a little bit better than the first film, but both films where good in there way.Peter Parker(Andrew Garfield) a smart 19 year old, with a huge chip on his shoulder, who has a secret crush on Gwen Stacey(Emma Stone), lives with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May(Martin Sheen and Sally Field), still trying to figure out what happened to his parents, only to discover that his dad worked with Curt Conners(Rhys Ifans), while visiting his lab, is bitten by radioactive spider, and gains the powers of a spider. Okay there is so much more that I do not want to give away.Andrew Garfield was great as Peter Parker, I liked the way he does not try to be carbon copy of Tobey Mcguires Spider Man, but playing the part in his own way. Emma Stone was super charming as Gwen Stacey, she really brought a lot to the film, and she and Garfield have incredible chemistry. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are also great here. Not to mention Denis Leary and Rhys Ifans. And the effects don't disappoint either.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good remake from the Tobey Maguire franchise that got rebooted,"The Amazing Spiderman is a reboot of the 2002 action fantasy starring Tobey Maguire,except this time British actor Andrew Garfield is now the man wearing the blue spandex tights,the tight red top and the spidey mask,along with the red boots.The story kicks off with Peter Parker as a kid and his parents bring him to his Aunt May(Sally Field)and Uncle Ben's(Martin Sheen)house who rear Peter as his guardian as his parents died that night in a plane crash. Years later Peter is now a teenager and goes to High School where he has a crush on Gwen Stacey(Emma Stone) and his facing the bullies who are at him. So when he goes to OSCOP that same day after school where Dr Connors works(Rhys Ifans) he discovers some secrets about his father and the mysterious briefcase his father hid from him,as well as discovering a tree that holds spiders where he gets bit by one and starts developing superhuman powers that night. That same night he gets into a row with his uncle,causing him to go after him but Ben gets shot and Peter gets revenge on the man that shot his Uncle Ben and decides to use his superhuman powers to fight the bad guys.It may not be as good as the original 2002 film with Tobey Maguire,Kirsten Dunst and James Franco,but its still a good film to watch if you love Spiderman or just grew up watching Spiderman as a kid.Check it out and see can you untangle yourself in Spidey's web.Andrew Garfield was good as Peter and makes him more rebellious and less nerdy. Emma Stone was good as the love interest,and Rhys Ifans was good as the villain although his transformation gets very creepy to watch once the experiment he does goes horribly wrong as he wanted to grow an arm back,causing him to change into the lizard man.But hey like I said it was a good flick.Overall it gets a 7.B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nice,"This is the long awaited 'The Amazing Spider-Man'. Everything about this movie can be summed up in one word 'NICE', it is a very elegant movie with very elegant actors/actresses everyone played their roles beautifully. Andrew Garfield is the next big thing, Emma Stone is destined for greatness, everything is nice but i have got to say that it was not as expected. The story line is very predictable, it was not creative enough some details were actually kind of useless and exaggerated. To sum up 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is a nice and decent movie and is highly recommended for everybody whether you are a Super Hero movies fan or not.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Empty hearted web slinger,"Sam Raimi's Spider Man trilogy began in 2002 and a decade later we have the reboot with Andrew Garfield's more geeky hipster take replacing Tobey Maguire.However the film feels pointless, we have another origins story with Peter Parker getting bit by a radioactive spider and learns to harness his new powers and then the tragedy of Uncle Ben dying and realising that with his new powers comes great responsibility.The villain here is a Green Lizard instead of the Green Goblin, a man wanting to regrow his arm but the experiment goes horribly wrong.The police pursue Spider Man as they believe he is a menace and Parker has a touching and believable relationship with Gwen Stacy whose father is the policeman pursuing Spidey.The film is well made, slightly darker hued after the rebooted Dark Knight films, a good mix of action special effects and humour although the CGI lizard could had been better but the film feels empty despite the efforts of Andrew Garfield.A soulless film made solely so Columbia Pictures can retain the rights to make Spider Man films.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Amazing Spider-Man Is Truly Amazing!,"The newest adaptation of the Spider-Man story, although a bit early, is arguably the best one yet. The guys in my office at DISH think that was due to the fact that the script stays a lot closer to the original Spider-Man comics plot, but I think it was because we were giving more information about the disappearance of Peter's parents. Also the writers made a bold move to have Peter spend more time in high school and I am positive that that is going to pay off in the long run. I never have time to stop at the Redbox down the street to grab movies, but since I started renting from Blockbuster at Home through DISH the discs are already waiting in my mailbox when I get off work and this was an awesome first choice.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Low expectations,"Most people might have overrated this movie, just because they went in expecting this to be one of the worst Blockbusters made (in recent years). Fortunately that is not the case. Just the fact they cast Martin Sheen and Sally Fields as a couple was one great coup. Great chemistry there. All the actors work in this one actually, but those two bring some weight/gravitas to the whole movie.Of course the movie does have its weaknesses, such as logic or other things the screenwriter couldn't be bothered with. But that doesn't and shouldn't be an obstacle you can't overcome. Because otherwise you wouldn't be able to enjoy the movie as the majority did (as is evident by the voting on here).Of course it is a bit weird seeing a similar origin story again after only 10 years (most will still have the Raimi movie fresh in mind). But it does work, which did surprise me too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
the pointless spider-man,"OK, if you are wondering why they made another spider-man movie, there is actually no concrete answer. The story is mostly same and there is no amazing fight scene or whatsoever that could make this movie or the spider-man character amazing. So if anything at all, you can call this movie as the pointless spider-man. I am sick of watching remakes of great movies. Just that you can shoot the movie in 3D (and the 3D of this movie was the worst I have ever seen) doesn't mean you should make another movie. I mean it, I don't want to pay to see the same things over and over anymore. Here is my grading for this movie. -1 for the originality, -1 for the acting, -2 for the super super bad 3D.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Exceeded my expectations!,"The Amazing Spider-Man is one of the best movies of 2012, so far. Great chemistry between the 2 actors, fantastic visual effects, memorable action scenes and a a new level of emotional depth, not seen in a Spider-Man movie. The movie constantly delivers on character development and thrilling action sequences. My low expectations were obliterated, what a surprise! Aside from the 3D animation looking fantastic and the film having a dark, complex feel to it that makes it feel more grown up, the primary reason worth watching is Andrew Garfield.Andrew Garfield was terrific as Spider-Man, he not only looks like Peter Parker, but he embodies the character. Something only a few actors are able to do. Emma Stone is, as always very charming and effective in her role as Gwen Stacy. The chemistry between them is so well done, and performed. The scenes between them truly elevate the film, as a whole. Uncle Ben, played by the veteran actor Martin Sheen. Sheen brings the intrinsic qualities of family love and togetherness to the movie. Rhys Ifans is great as Dr. Connors, although I felt he was a bit underused. Everyone works so well together, the cast is by far the best out of all the Spidey movies, yet.In many ways it represents an improvement over the Raimi films, particularly the misbegotten third installment, especially in its emphasis on the adolescent nature of its protagonist. Though Garfield is 28, he makes a credible 17-year-old - although Maguire was a year younger when he first pulled on the tights a decade ago, his Parker seemed conspicuously adult. The action scenes and the visual effects are totally exhilarating, believable and totally engrossing. Even though this reboot may be unnecessary, now I can't wait until The Amazing Spider-man 2.I sort of hate comparing this to the original trilogy because it is trying to be its own thing, but you can't escape the fact that it's such a recent reboot. However the movie stands on its own, as great reboot and a pleasure to watch! ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" has everything you could ask from a summer movie. Action, romance, imagination and smart writing.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My biggest disappointment at the movies this summer,"Now I ain't a big fan of Sam Raimi's version of ""Spider-Man"" it just wasn't that consistent with the comic books or even stayed all that close to the comic books all that much. This one decides to go in a more cool and realistic direction but that seemed to be the main focus of it all without much emphasis on making a entertaining movie with a better script. I liked how makers of this movie tried to modernize everything in today's standard, thus not making the movie all cheesy and stuff like Sam Raimi's version. Like for instance Peter Parker(Andrew Garfield) is a nerd like how Peter Parker is suppose to be but he isn't portrayed as one of those stereotypical nerds. Instead he is one of those quite nerds that is very quite lack confidence in many areas and always sits in the back to the point of almost never getting noticed. What was the most disappointing is how lacking it is, in character development and the bonding elements in this movie. Marc Webb's only full feature movie besides this one is ""500 Days of Summer"" which was a well made romance/relationship movie. But the chemistry between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy(Emma Stone) isn't well developed. Sometimes it's just not close to being believable at all. In fact it's really inconsistent yeah it's playful but inconsistent. I kept wondering what really linked these two characters together. Even Peter Parker's bond between Uncle Ben(Martin Sheen) is just weak and not enough bonding time went into it. When the main reason why Peter Parker became Spider-Man is because of Uncle Ben. Even Peter Parker isn't all that likable in this movie, so he is going through some traumatic time in his life. But people around the world is going through so much worse. Now Spider-Man is known for being a superhero that taunts and humiliates his foes and I was expecting him to do that quite a bit in this. And wanted to laugh or at least be amused by his one liners but there isn't much of that here. Maybe it's because he is just getting use to his powers in this one, but was still sort of disappointing. When they marketed this movie to the public it tries to go in some untold secret, but there really isn't anything like that in this. Nothing that will throw the audience off in a good way or anything like that. Now I didn't like Sam Raimi's version of ""Spider-Man"" all that much, it's was just so darn cheesy sometimes and doesn't connect with the comics all that much but it was still enjoyable and entertaining. Now some reviewers claim this reboot is better than all the Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" combined and that is a overstatement in my opinion. This is a darker cooler and more modernized version of ""Spider-Man"" but it sure does have it's flaws. Now when it comes to the Spider-Man fight sequences it's really realistic, especially with the movement of Spider-Man and all. It really felt like your watching a webslinger in action sort of. The physics and movements seemed like your actually watching a guy in a suit moving although it's CGI. The fight scene with Spider-Man and The Lizard was cool and sort of reminded me of the fight in ""Ultimate Spider-Man"" although that was against the Green Goblin. The casting choices is good Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone is alright although there are other actors and actresses that might have done a better job that I can think of. But Rhys Ifans was perfect for the role Dr. Curt Connors and Denis Leary was right on target with the role of Captain Stacy. Overall this isn't a terrible Spider-Man movie, much better than ""Spider-Man 3"" for sure. It almost seemed like they tried to be different just for the sake of being different between the past ""Spider-Man"" movies. Which is understandable, but it just seemed they were really forcing it. I really wanted to enjoy this movie, in fact Spider-Man is one of my favorite superhero but this was kinda disappointing. ""Spider-Man 2"" is still the best Spider-Man movie so far.6.8/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I love Andrew Garfield's Spiderman,"Most of you will disagree with me on this one, but I believe Andrew's spiderman is the best spiderman the silver screen has seen. After the release of NWH, I decided to take an adventure to this universe. Come to find out, I don't agree with any hate for these movies. The writing, although scratchy in some places, is fixed by the skilled performance of Andrew Garfield. Tom Holland comes across as a team player, Toby, although spectacular, doesn't quite match the teenage notion of how spiderman is portrayed. Garfield has a much more childish view of life, and consequences of his decisions. His Peter Parker is moody, as a normal teen is. His spiderman is carefree, but he learns from his mistakes. This is why I believe he is the best spiderman that has ever existed. Although most don't, I'm routing for you Andrew. You are amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Redundant from the very beginning,"I'm a bit ambivalent towards superhero films. Sure, they offer crowd-pleasing entertainment, but most of them turn into CGI monstrosities devoid of originality and wit long before the ending, and unfortunately the same thing happens with THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN. And that's without mentioning that this is an entirely redundant remake of the Sam Raimi original, which only came out about a decade ago.See, I liked the Raimi trilogy of Spiderman flicks. Raimi brought his own directorial quirks to the films, making them slightly campy and a whole lot of fun. Here, it's all about earnestness, which is dull, and it quickly becomes obvious that director Marc Webb (a made-up name, surely?) has little experience of handling this kind of expensive material.Andrew Garfield has a knack for picking slightly irritating characters and that knack is evidence in his Peter Parker, who lacks the decency that Tobey Maguire brought to the role. The whole high school schtick is faintly embarrassing to sit through, but it gets worse about halfway through when the plot dissolves to be replaced by one CGI-laden action sequence after another. They're all silly and predictable, lacking the kind of choreography that a director like, say, Christopher Nolan, would bring to them.There's little else to enjoy along the way, either. I didn't like Kristen Dunst in the Raimi trilogy, but Emma Stone is hardly better, a bland blonde bimbo and nothing more. Rhys Ifans is impossible to take seriously as the bad guy, while old-timers Martin Sheen and Sally Field have very little to work with. There's no great insight into the characters or anything like that; in fact, this is just a kid's film that anyone older than a teenager will struggle to enjoy.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good old Spidey returns.,"A boy is bitten by a spider and is given arachnid-like powers that allow him to become a vigilante crime fighter. Meanwhile, he unwittingly assists a Doctor to achieve his goal of regenerating limbs but its side effects jeopardises him and the inhabitants of his city.Director Marc Webb's Amazing Spider-man is essentially a satisfactory superhero film which captures the character of the Spider-man who appears in the comics and cartoons. While like its recent counterparts there's lots of computer generated imagery. However, this version benefits and looks much better for its practical segments that ground Spider-man making him that little bit more amazing.Rhys Ifans is excellent as the troubled, empathetic Dr. Curt Connors/Lizard. Again the special effects are well put together and The Lizard is wonderfully realised. Andrew Garfield balances his transition into a superhero coupled with the collage kid successfully and makes a great Peter Parker with his enjoyable wit, sincerity and charm. The supporting cast are first rate including the likes of Sally Field, Dennis Leary and Emma Stone as gifted love interest Gwen Stacy. Notably, Martin Sheen captures the sense of humour and gravity required for Uncle Ben. The pacing is spot on and the film never out stays it welcome, accompanied by a top James Horner score that really comes to life during the action scenes.While James Vanderbilt's screenplay with input from Steve Kloves and Alvin Sargent is full of subtleness, one liners and repartee, Vanderbilt's story is all too familiar reminiscent of X-Men (2000) our Lizard, like Magneto wants to make everyone like him. There's also the regurgitated plot elements.That's the main stumbling block for this incarnation of Spider-Man, familiarity. It hampers what essential is a good foundation. There were 25 years between the made for TV The Amazing Spider-man (1977) and Spider-man (2002) and in that time there were advancements in filmmaking and more money put into the first true film. With this Spidey there's less of a gap - with Sam Raimi's last surprisingly heavy and drawn out outing being 2007. Webb and cinematographer John Schwartzman can't get away from it being the same setting, period and time so the look here is inevitably similar. It's not that comic, film, cartoon Web slinger fans don't know origin story already but it's the fact it feels we've just seen the same thing, in the same medium only a moment ago.For anyone alien to the superhero this will be a great version of Spider-man. It's an improvement on its predecessor - certainly in its spirit and tone but by default it's not fresh. Like the Hulk (2003) and it's reboot The Incredible Hulk (2008) it's a shame the studio didn't get it right first time, but hey, with great power comes great responsibility.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It won't blow you away, but it'll keep you entertained for those two hours.","Disclaimer: I am a Tobey McGuire fan. I liked the first two spider man films and found the third installment atrociously bad (i.e. story wise). A reboot five years later did not make sense especially since the whole idea behind it seemed inclined towards making it a 3D extravaganza. Also, isn't the Lizard a second class villain?Peter Parker (Max Charles) aged four is playing a game of hide n seek with his father Richard Parker (Campbell Scott) when he discovers his dad's study room in a mess. Realizing that there was a break-in, Richard Parker and his wife Mary Parker (Embeth Davidtz) leave Peter at his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben's (Martin Sheen) house while trying to flee an unknown (to us) enemy. Fast forward and Peter (Andrew Garfield) is all grown up into a nerdy college student who's got a passion for photography, science and his crush Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Stumbling on his father's old briefcase, he finds a photo of him with a colleague named Dr. Curtis Connors (Rhys Ifans) along with some secret documents. Sneaking his way into pharmaceutical company named Oscorp; Peter impresses Connors, eludes his crush and gets bitten by a genetically modified spider. And, we all know what happens next.As evident, 'The Amazing Spider Man' is an origin story where we revisit the college years of Peter and his transformation into your friendly neighborhood hero Spider Man. It was the year 2002 when Sam Raimi introduced us to the Web slinging franchise. With Marc Webb at the helm this time, he had some pretty big shoes to fill just a decade later.With a story more inclined towards the comic book, Webb managed to bring something different in comparison. More time is spent showing the teenage angst of Peter as he stumbles through his new found abilities such that you tend to prefer Peter over Spider Man. This favor-ability dually also lies with Andrew Garfield's brilliant act. He embodies the role of Peter with natural, genuine charm ranging from being a typical teenager to a tentative lover, a volatile nephew or a faltering hero. As Spider Man, he fails to blow you away as he lacks the screen presence you expect from a superhero.Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was a huge improvement as a love interest. There was no screaming 'damsel in distress' moments that had become such an integral part of the previous trilogy. You instead get some smartness and humor with bucket loads of chemistry between her and Andrew which does become one high key of the film.The Jekyll and Hyde combo of Dr. Connors and The Lizard is a mixed bag of good human presence and bad reptile representation. Rhys Ifans is good as Dr. Connors and his transformation to the dark side seemed promising. Unfortunately apart from some in your face 'jumpy' scenes, the design of the Lizard was disappointing especially that humanoid face.Denis Leary as Gwen's father Captain Stacy was good as the authoritative police figure without any over the top attics. Veteran actors Martin Sheen and Sally Field were well cast and were good in their lovable warm interpretation of the characters. Irrfan Khan as Norman Osborn's minion Rajit Ratha was wasted.With lots of web slinging action, it's hard to go wrong with 3D. Fortunately 3D was not overly used with it being limited to the action scenes only. Cinematography and camera work was brilliant and the soundtrack went along perfectly. Screenplay and those witty dialogues were spot on. I really like the comic book touch of inane wisecracks during action scenes from Spiderman. Talking about the action scenes, they might not be 'The Avengers' level of awesome, but are fun to watch nonetheless.CGI was substandard to say the least; something you don't expect from a big budget summer film. A little investigation leads us to the culprits, i.e. Sony Pictures Imageworks who were behind the eye-sore 'The Green Lantern'. Some of the plots (spider suit for example) seemed rushed and unexplained while some of them were just unnecessary placed into the script to lead to something more dramatic. And, even though the story is well paced, a running time of 136mins does push it a little far.It clearly helped cast good actors when the idea of rebooting this franchise popped up. The Amazing Spider Man is an enjoyable and a somewhat refreshing take on the story already told a decade ago. It won't blow you away, but it'll keep you entertained for those two hours.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best thought out movie out off all the Spider-Man's,"Honestly I don't get why this movie gets such a low review here on imdb, I think this is the most thought out movie out off all the spiderman movies including the new ones with actor Tom Holland. This movie serves justice to the MCU comics and the roll of clumsy yet smart Peter Parker, which is something i think lacks in the new movies with Tom Holland. Also the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone is insane , more mature and raw than in the new marvel adaptation, without mentioning this movie has just the right amount of comedic aspect which adds points in things I didn't like about the new MCU adaptation with Tom Holland, like I felt I was watching a Comedy for the whole ass movie and I'm not saying is bad to have comedy but the whole movie just felt like satire.Don't get me wrong it's not like I don't like the new MCU adaptation and I love Tom Holland but this one is just more related to the comic and overall better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
His only weakness is the ladies.,"Entertaining, but very unimpressive, the Spider-Man franchise reboot ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" may only be interesting for anybody under the age of ten. Working with an average script (containing too many one liners for my taste) Marc Webb directs this version with a CGI first mentality, which does become overwhelmingly distracting over time. In Webb's version, Spider-Manwell, if you don't know the story of Spider-Man by now then you probably have a life and aren't going to see this version anyway; therefore, I'm not going to waste ink explaining it to you now. So, if you are familiar with the 2002 version, the only elements that differ in this latest version are as follows: scenes which develop more of an origin story dealing with Peter Parkers parents, Peter Parker's relationship with Gwen Stacy (as it was in the original comic) and Spider-Man (played by Andrew Garfield) and his battle against one of the lamest villains in the series: Dr. Curt Conners aka The Lizard (who isn't even wearing the signature white lab coat). I will say this, if you are expecting a darker remake, you will be sorely disappointed. If anything Raimi's version was darker and this one is much more kid friendly. So let's get to the point; does the heavy CGI and the slightly revamped storyline set ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" apart as one of the best summer super hero films in recent years? No, not really. Simply stated, as a Marvel superhero film, it falls somewhere under ""The Avengers"" or ""Iron Man"", but still ranks higher than the catastrophe that was ""Captain America: The First Avenger"".OK, so this isn't so bad, in fact it was more or less entertaining throughout, due to some funny bits of dialogue and engaging performances from the entire ensemble. The problem here, which will resonate time and time again in the minds of anyone who sees ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", is how this reboot isn't on the same level as the 2002 version, and furthermore doesn't even attempt to set itself apart from that version, as a good reboot should. I hate to constantly be comparing this version to Raimi's 2002 version, because I'd rather review this title on its own merits, BUT since ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is only ten years removed from a far too similar version (and only five years removed from ""Spider-Man 3""), I would be pretty naive to even attempt to avoid comparisons to ""Spider-Man"". So, let me get this comparison thing over with now: 1. Toby Maguire (Seabiscuit) plays a better (nerdier looking) Spider-Man than Andrew Garfield (even though Garfield is remarkably believable as a teenager).2. Sam Raimi's vision compared to Marc Webb's by the numbers, CGI driven (befitting a Green Lantern sequel) film, was truly the sign of a more accomplished director who wanted to do something different with the beloved Spider-Man character. In short, Webb's version looks like the old one, and Raimi's looks like the revamped, more stylized, reboot.3. The witty writing style of David Koepp (Mission: Impossible, Angels and Demons) definitely was a huge factor in bringing the 2002 version out of the cartoonish television realm. As for the playful screenplay, which really brought ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" back down to a more child-friendly level, written by the team of James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves, while does tell a more accurate story, doesn't contain the same level of life Koepp's script had (I don't know how else to say it).The fact is that the only real improvement from ""Spider-Man"" to ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is the performance of Emma Stone playing Gwen Stacy, which is a substantial improvement over Kirsten Dunst (Marie Antoinette) as Mary Jane Watson. So, there you have it, 2002's ""Spider-Man"" was an all around better version and I challenge anyone to argue against anything I've just said.Side Note: The problem with rebooting an immensely successful franchise not a decade afterwards, is that unless it is remade to be so drastically different in story or tone (aka what Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight series did for the Batman legacy) it will always be seen as a disappointment or simply unnecessary. In fact, the way this film plays out, a strong argument could be made that the ONLY REASON a new Spider-Man film was made at all (and so soon) was because Sam Raimi's speculated ""Spider-Man 4"" catastrophically fell apart a few years ago.Final Thought: While I do commend these filmmakers for attempting to bring forth a Spider-Man remake whose story is almost entirely built off of the ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" comic books (a storyline all but ignored in the Raimi's trilogy) I still don't believe that that is a strong enough reason as to why this reboot/remake needed to be made, or watched (by anybody not into superhero films) for that matter. Also to make things worse, there is no need to stay for the teaser after the final credits roll, as it's one of the most disappointing and confusing since the inception of the superhero end credit teasers.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

It sure is the amazing Spider-Man,"We can't deny that Andrew's performance as Peter Parker is absolutely phenomenal. He's an extremely talented actor, and it's safe to say that the reason why this movie didn't get such a high rating might be because people weren't pleased knowing that someone else would be taking up this role after Tobey. Some might have been disappointed, but the truth is that this movie is incredible. For me, I've never seen anyone bring such a role to life as well as Andrew.

An amazingly intelligent Spiderman,"Amazing Spiderman is well ... definitely amazing in its special effects, art direction and Andrew Garfield's characterization. My generation has grown up on the Spiderman cartoon which used to be aired on the only Doordarshan channel every Sunday evening. In anticipation for the movie to start I was humming the song, ""Spiderman Spiderman, does whatever a spider can, spins a web any size, catches thieves just like flies ..."" when my confused son told me stop. I say he was confused because first, I was singing this ancient song and second, he was expecting to see Tobey Maguire and was not sure if Andrew Garfield was the real one. Coming back to the movie, the amazing Spiderman is different from the ""original"" Spiderman. The amazing Spiderman takes the same path as the original story where Peter Parker is the school geek bullied by jocks and has a huge crush on one of the prettiest girls on campus. The more visible changes are, introduction of Peter's parents (which actually explains his inclination to science), the absence of Mary Jane and her being replaced by Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), the loudmouthed editor of Daily Bugle J. Jonah Jameson is missing & even though Uncle Ben is murdered by a fleeing burglar, the background is slightly different. The biggest metamorphosis from the original however happens due to Peter Parker's (Andrew Garfield) characterization. Andrew Garfield is way cooler than Tobey Maguire; he definitely has more attitude, even when he is being bullied or speaking to his girlfriend's dad. He is intelligent and not just a product of destiny (actually works on a machine to enhance his web's strength and slinging mechanism). And, he is much more human, the black eyes & wounds on his face are proof enough that he gets hurt while fighting a much stronger enemy. Peter Parker as a character is strong in his hooded jersey and does not beg for sympathy from the viewer, but at times I felt he was too detached and lacked emotional content. At time it seemed he hardly cared about secrecy and was more like a show off which definitely increased his appeal. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is a welcome change with her pretty face and subtle sarcasm; looks very promising and complements Andrew Garfield with great chemistry. Denis Leary as Captain Stacy gives an impactful performance as police captain and father of an intelligent girl dating Spiderman. We have our very own Irrfan Khan as Rajit Ratha running Oscorp in a no nonsense role, but fails to make an impact and seem a little stiff in his dialogue delivery. The one handed Dr. Curt Connors played by Rhys Ifan is believable and cunning but as a villain The Lizard is just plain repulsive & huge (Green Goblin from the original can kick his ass anytime). Marc Webb's (known for 500 Days of summer) direction is commendable, though I can't help but feel that he was chosen to direct a web-slinging adventure more so because of his last name. Another strong character which made a statement for me (more so because I am an architect) was the Oscorp Headquarter building with its ultra modern systems (like a really cool touch screen access control lock). Standing right in the heart of Manhattan (New York) the imposing building form signifies the power of a company like Oscorp. In the climax sequence it definitely seems to be the jewel on the crown of Manhattan's skyline especially in the 3-D version when the camera moves over the needle of the building. That was one of the best city shots I have ever seen in a movie. Though I still miss the original Spiderman, the current day superhero is more believable, intelligent, stronger at the same time human. At the end of it my son asked me question which made me think.

A much more promising start than the last Spider-Man,"2002's Spider-Man was an awful movie, mainly due to an incompetent script. It was followed by the decent Spider-Man 2 but returned to form with another bad one, Spider-Man 3.That series was not the right way to do Spider-Man; this movie is the right way. While the 2002 film felt like it had been written by a committee who were neither familiar with the original material nor reading one another's work, this movie appears to have been written by people who repeatedly asked the question no one ever asked during the first series: ""does this make sense?""For the most part, Amazing Spider-Man does make sense, with a fairly convincing origin story (except for a lack of explanation as to why what happened to Peter couldn't be used to create millions of Spider-Mans). The movie takes its time as Peter transitions from dweeb to super hero, then it gets into a super-villain story that also makes sense, and (again unlike the earlier film) is exciting and well paced.The surprising thing about this movie is how serious Peter is. The tradition of the series is a wise-cracking good guy, but while Spidey does get some witty lines, the movie is better represented by the way Peter removes his mask in one scene to calm a child; it's more about the Spider-Man with a deep compassion and a need to make the world better than the Spider-Man who likes to swing through the air and beat up mutant creatures. I would have liked more wise cracking, but I appreciate the approach.Far better than the overrated The Avengers, this is a superhero movie done right. It is not the most memorable movie, and it doesn't have anything as notable as the famous upside-down kiss from the 2002 film, but it is very solid. And while in the week since I saw it most of the details have faded away, that's much better than that 2002 film, which created so many bad memories that I can still, all these years later, reel off a list of all the movie's problems.Watch this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Solid re-boot that finds a deeper focus of Parker's distress,"After Sam Raimi departing from a fourth Spider-Man project, the news of a ""reboot"" of the franchise was met with cries of anger from the plebeian fanboys. Only ten years after Spider-Man (2002) was released, and five years since the debacle that was Spider-Man 3 (2007), it did seem like a project that would be a bit too soon for comfort. But as these angry diatribes filled blogs and chat rooms on the inter-web, I considered these conditions. After all, the fanboys that are so very antagonised at such things, are the same bedroom boys who lap up everything that the comic book world has to offer - including the many, many, many ""reboots"" of comic book characters over the decades by the major comic book publishers. So I asked myself, is this really such a major issue? Now that Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy has finished there will be no doubt that Warner Bros. (owners of DC comics and all of its ""contents"") will be ""rebooting"" the Batman franchise, and it seems that The Man of Steel may tread a similar path at reinvigorating a character.Of course, because of the success of the Dark Knight triptych, the prerequisite focus from those idiot executives would have been that this new film will ultimately need to be ""darker"" - a tone that has been used in the media since the early '90's, but which has been actually realised in the first decade of the 21st century. I have no issue with the ""darker"" approach, but often it is simply a synonym for violence. In The Amazing Spider-Man however, story/co-screenwriter, James Vanderbilt, - whose previous Zodiac (2007) script was a revelation - has managed to instil this concept of dark into the protagonists anguish at discovering insidious science from his long-dead parents. The Spider-Man origin story is a very well-known, and well trodden story arc, but Vanderbilt (along with co-writers Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves), and director Marc Webb have dug deep into the mythos and found a deeper focus of Peter Parker's distress, and a more interesting and probable path into his arachnid genetic future.Living with his aunt and uncle (Sally Field and Martin Sheen), Parker (Andrew Garfield) discovers a leather suitcase containing secret scientific papers owned by his dead father (played by Campbell Scott), a scientist working in Marvel universes science corporation, Oscorp. It's contents suggest a project involving cross-species genetics, and leads Parker to the offices where his fathers partner, Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), whose arm was severed and he searches for a cure using reptilian genetic splicing. On his first visit, Parker is bitten by a spider (obviously), in a scene flooded with blue colour, and one that has more visual drama than the accidental approach in 2002's origin story. Parker's obsession with the science work of his father leads to an equation that solves issues with the experiment, and he offers this to Connors - an action that is later regretful.In high school Peter's persona is slightly less dorky than the Tobey Maguire incarnation. He still has bully issues from the Flash Thompson character (Chris Zylka), but he is more intense, aggravated, and intelligent. His lack of knowledge of his parents demise, and his isolation gives the character more depth. Deleting the Mary-Jane and replacing with Gwen Stacey (the always electrifying Emma Stone) is a slight, but alternative change, but their relationship becomes more engrossing - and one which becomes more exquisite on discovering that her father, Captain Stacey (Denis Leary), is the police chief pursuing the spider-dude.In the first major set-piece involving Spider-Man and Connors' later genetic manifestation, The Lizard, they don't actually clash, but creates a tender and beautiful moment as Spider-Man rescues a child trapped in a car dangling from the Brooklyn bridge. In this reboot, Parker never seems too reluctant to take the mask off, and offers it to the young boy as a placebo to move his terrified body into action. The father of the son later gets the opportunity to give back to the wall crawler, in another touching moment, and one that reflects the New Yorker united moments of Raimi's trilogy.Of course, Parker is pushed into his crime fighting ways due to the murder of his Uncle Ben, and the screenwriters attempt to write the same message but without stating ""with great power comes great responsibility"" which is tackled rather well, if a little convoluted. Ifans' Connors is often wooden, and seems too villainous, when in fact he shouldn't be - in other words his villainous attitude does come on a bit too fast. The CGI Lizard's characterisation and face was unsatisfactory and could have done with being more fantastical than reptilian-realism. But these are minor infractions to an interesting, exciting, and character driven re-start to a franchise. I would have preferred more screen time for Stone's Gwen - Stone's comic acting is excellent, and should be used here more often (in a scene where she attempts to hide Parker in her bedroom from her father, sees this comedic acting, but could have been so much more. I actually look forward to seeing where a sequel may go, and hope that the screen writing duties go to Vanderbilt again - he certainly knows how to write characters, and since the bar for superhero movies has been set so high this year by The Dark Knight Rises and The Avengers, it is intelligent writing that the genre so dearly needs.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My Spidey senses are not tingling...,"What a disappointment... Squeezed between the awesomeness of The Avengers & the anticipation of The Dark Knight Rises, The Amazing Spiderman looked to be bringing us a grittier, more character driven take on our hero with Mark Webb (500 Days of Summer) in the directors chair, and Andrew Garfield & Emma Stone in tow. Unfortunately we instead have to suffer through nearly 2 & a half hours of pouting & gesturing from Garfield (It's like he's imitating Edward from Twilight I swear...) & a whole bunch of action scenes that are nothing you haven't seen done better before (& in better movies). And why does everyone seem to know Peter Parker is Spiderman? Isn't his identity meant to be secret?!? Spidey seems to spend more time in this film with his mask off, than he does with his mask on. I'm sure given his last name Webb thought he was born to make this film, but seriously, I preferred Spiderman 3... & that's really saying something! Stay home, pull that copy of Spiderman 2 off your shelf, and save your money for Batman in a few weeks. You'll be glad you did.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
ignore the obvious familiarities and you'll have a good time,"As a child, Peter Parker's parents abruptly abandoned him, leaving him in the care of his right-minded aunt and uncle. Years later, Peter has become a highly intelligent high school teenager but is still deeply troubled by the absence of his parents. He uncovers a briefcase that allows him to follow in his father's footsteps in a breakthrough study of biological research, but when Peter is bitten by an unusual spider and the research turns out to be much more radical than he anticipated, his life is quickly turned upside down. Reboot/remake of the series that began with Sam Raimi's 2002 original can't avoid some familiarities, and is let down by a long running time and some thinly developed characters, but it's made worthwhile by good casting, nifty special effects, and intense, edge of your seat action scenes. Fun, even though we've pretty much seen it all before. **½",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very average compared to the last franchise,"I didn't really feel an emotion connection with this movie. I just wasn't getting the impression that the Peter Parker character was that vulnerable before the transformation and afterwards Andrew Garfield still looked too lanky to be a convincing Spiderman. The famous ""with great power comes great responsibility"" quote wasn't even scripted in. That was too much of a deviation from the original comic book story.Also there should have been more mention of the financial pressures faced by Aunt May after Uncle Ben's death. That would have really tugged on some heart strings.There was was good visual special effects. But I think the voice of the lizard still sounded to human. The lizard also looked too much like a gorilla with scales, nothing like the comic book which looks more reptilian.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Familiar and contrasting at the same time,"The Amazing-Spider Man is clearly a film that wants to bring the character back to roots completely. The problem here is that the story is very familiar given how recent Sam Raimi's films were and bar a couple of characters being replaced with new ones this one feels very familiar still. The difference here is a sort of pseudo realistic approach for the character. It was never going to be a case of Spider- Man being completely realistic as he is a man bitten by a radioactive spider and given superpowers while the villain is a man who's literally turned into a giant lizard. The partly realistic approach comes from the fact that there are explanations made for the suit and the webs are not organic and are now made mechanically by Peter Parker himself. Small details in the origin remain the same such as Uncle Ben, but the film does feel fresh. We do not actually see Spider-Man until a long while into the film and while this is not an unusual tactic for superhero films it simply felt like this may have been better suited to a TV series format as it paved the way for a massive change in shift once the villain storyline in particular got going. Action wise, the film looks amazing. There is great weight to the action scenes and there does feel like tension. All the actors did a good job with a special mention for Andrew Garfield in the title role. He managed to bring back the wit of Spider-Man in a very good way and I felt as if he delivered it well. At least I didn't find him annoying in the way he could have been. All in all the film is enjoyable, it does not blow you away however with more action it could have done. But it provided sterling entertainment and actually made the effort to tell a story without over indulging.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider-man-child,"Spiderman in this movie seems to be a young adult who has been coddled by his parents. He doesn't seem to be able to deal with the real world. He's like a man-child.When I think of heroes, I don't think of man-childs. There were kids in this movie who were more heroic, and more mature than Spiderman. There were actually a great number of characters in this movie who were more heroic than Spiderman.Spiderman might have been the lowest common denominator. I think he might have dragged some heroic characters, including his girlfriend, down to his man-child level.The end result wasn't pathetic. But it was dumbed down.

Pass the Popcorn! review,"Rebooting the Spider-Man franchise just five years after Spider-Man 3 may initially seem like a pretty pointless and unusual thing to do. However, when you take in mind the Sony-Marvel contract, which mandates Sony to make a Spider-Man movie every five years or they lose the rights over the characters, the picture becomes clearer. Originally, Spider-Man 4 was planned, but there were some creative differences between Sam Raimi and the studio, so he pulled out of the project, and Sony ultimately decided to reboot the whole franchise. Considering how awful Spider-Man 3 was, the reboot idea doesn't seem that bad anymore, but The Amazing Spider-Man doesn't offer anything new and it still feels pointless.In case you don't know – the movie follows Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), a teenager whose parents mysteriously left him when he was a young child and who now lives with his uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and aunt May (Sally Field). One day he learns of a doctor named Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), who worked with his father, and decides to visit him at his workplace – Oscorp. There Peter gets bitten by a strange spider and soon develops spider-like abilities and uses them to become a superhero named Spider-Man. He meets his first villain when Dr. Curt Connors injects himself with mutagen chemicals and becomes the menacing Lizard.The Amazing Spider-Man definitely isn't a terrible movie: the casting and the acting are great – Andrew Garfield is a very believable Spider-Man, and the always likable Emma Stone is superb as his love interest Gwen Stacy, and they have a lot of chemistry. The action sequences and the visual effects are decent: they are by no means superb, but are exciting enough for a generic superhero popcorn movie flick. And the director, Marc Webb (who never directed a big blockbuster movie before), did a satisfying job. Furthermore, the movie is darker and more brooding than Sam Raimi's trilogy (actually, the movie is more similar to Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy than to Raimi's movies), which works surprisingly well.Even though The Amazing Spider-Man has some strong points, the movie utterly fails script wise. The movie spends a big chunk of its over 2 hours runtime on a origin story which the audience is already familiar with. Not only that, but all the characters in the movie are conveniently tied to one another in an absurdly naive fashion. Moreover, some scenes are ludicrous (Peter not being able to control his powers and the infamous cranes scene). Because of that, The Amazing Spider-Man can get both tedious and silly from time to time, which may severely annoy some viewers. And speaking of silly, The Lizard design could have been improved to some degree (he should at least have kept his lab coat on!). In a nutshell, The Amazing Spider-Man isn't as bad as it could have been, but it still is a pretty dull and pointless movie which offers nothing new to justify the reboot.Rating: 6/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A flawed film elevated by Garfield and a terrific last act.,"I liked Raimi's Spider-man movies, especially the first two. So, I was a bit apprehensive about The Amazing Spider-Man but, went in to this reboot with an open mind. And while there are problems here and the film has flaws, it also has great potential and Andrew Garfield does a terrific job delivering a fresh take on Peter Parker/Spidey. Since my biggest problem was with the retelling of the origin, that bodes well for the next movie if done right. The problem I had with the origin is not that it is done differently but, to be honest, I don't think it really clicked. It seemed clunky and awkward and it just didn't grab me. They were trying to bring together elements concerning Parker's father and Peter himself into the main story and it seemed a bit forced, it didn't drag me in. Another part of the origin that didn't work for me was his relationship with his Uncle Ben. As Uncle Ben is also an important part of Peter's transformation, their relationship needed to be stronger and I never got a sense of how important they were to each other. One of the reasons is, I felt that the usually terrific Martin Sheen was miscast here. He just doesn't give Ben the charm and quiet strength that Cliff Robertson brought in the Raimi trilogy that made his importance to Peter believable. Their relationship isn't given much screen time and It never strongly establishes their bond. Sally Field's Aunt May fairs better although, once the plot is in full swing, she doesn't get to do more then look concerned as Peter comes home at odd hours with some battle scars from his superhero activities. The film really doesn't come together and really start to work till Parker begins to establish himself as Spider-Man and his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) starts to form. Here director Marc Webb (A guy named Webb directs a Spider-Man movie, how's that for a happy accident.) really brings it together and delivers. Garfield and Stone are great together and have a great chemistry. Stone is far more interesting then Dunst as Mary Jane and makes a far better match for Peter and a far spunkier heroine who doesn't stand on the sidelines waiting to be captured by the villain of the week. Gwen gives Peter a much needed emotional positivity in his troubled life and it's easy to believe that she gives him the strength to be a true hero and much more then just a wisecracking vigilante. Not that that stage isn't fun too. Rhys Ifans is fine as the noble Dr. Curt Connors whose quest to better the lives of the handicapped, including himself, leads to his emergence as the Lizard. Connors could have been a bit more threatening to a degree but, it worked for me that his core intentions were still good despite being twisted by the Lizard's rage and the maddening effects of the serum. He wants to turn us all into lizards with the best of intentions. And his CGI alter ego was impressive and came across as a dangerous foe for our freshman superhero. The numerous confrontations between the two were well done and escalated nicely till the big finale which really soars and Webb surprises us with how well he presented the action. And let us not forget a really good turn by Denis Leary as Gwen's dad, Captain Stacy. He has minimal screen time but, gives us a well rounded characterization that adds importance and weight to the scenes he's in. This is what Sheen failed to do for me, was make an impression and add depth to the story in the few scenes he was in. And I have always liked Sheen. So in conclusion, after a weak and somewhat clunky first act, the movie comes together and gives us what we came for. Andrew Garfield shines as the troubled yet brilliant Peter Parker and successfully takes an awkward teen and transforms him into a noble hero and gives us a fresh new take on a familiar character that we can't wait to see more of. There was spectacular action and drama and at the core a strong relation ship between Peter and Gwen that we also want to see more of. So, while Amazing Spider-Man is a flawed film, it's potential for the future of this new direction has us anticipating what comes next now that the characters and their possible directions are established. Bring it on!... and stay during the credits folks!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My review,"Honestly? I went in to see this with low expectations. I did not think it was a good idea to remake a movie less then ten years after the original but that's just me I guess , there seemed to be a big hype about it and I was dragged along by my friends regardless. So last night I went to see it in a fairly 'out of the times' cinema, which left me with no other option but to see it in 2d. I would have liked to see it in 3d as the trailer for it portrayed the 3d as a promising factor to the movie, but I got over that fairly quickly. )Andrew Garfield wore the role of Peter Parker almost flawlessly. It suited him to the tee. As well as getting most girls hearts to flip over by his edgy yet soft look, he probably made some men quiver with jealousy in their seats if they saw the look on most of their girlfriends faces.My main problem with the characters was Emma Stone as 'Gwen Stacy' . I mean I love Emma Stone as an actress herself and she did a very good job don't get me wrong but , what happened to Mary Jane! Maybe its just me but Mary Jane was a much more lovable character then Gwen Stacy.When it comes to the character of The Lizard / Dr. Curt Connors (played by Rhys Ifans) he was done well enough. I thought he as a lot less threatening then the past villains of the spider man movies but I thought he was lacking character.Another problem I had with this movie was spidery's suit. The web didn't come out of his fingers. It came out of this metal thing attached to his suit. The fudge?I thought the movie was a lot more child friendly then the last ones. The whole movie also seemed to take a little bit of a bypass when it came to the way it was done in the old movies. What I'm trying to say here is , it was a lot less comic like.Anyway over all I thought it was a pretty good movie with a good story line. Also I thought the director Marc Webb (How Ironic ) did a very good job.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I cannot express my disappointment.,"I love superhero movies, they capture our intangible desires, and at times take us to a different world. However, with this horrible remake, I only begged for the movie to end faster. The first 45 minutes of the movie was by far the worst set up I have ever seen; I was falling asleep. The dialogue was BEYOND cheesy, and the performances were mediocre. It felt like the original plan was to make a romance flick and add spiderman as a bonus. The movie is a reboot of the franchise, but why oh why are the events almost identical to the original spiderman! My biggest disappointment, by far, was the lack of epic action scenes, they were all quick and boring. The parallels were weak and super corny: (not a spoiler) there was a scene where Peter forgets to bring eggs home, some time later he brings the eggs and it becomes a magical moment in cinema. Also, the lizard...was extremely unrealistic, almost to the point of laughter. Character development was poor and left me hanging. The plot points were childish, cliché and meaningless. I'm sure some of you have seen the 4 minute trailer they released? That's as good as it gets. The trailer literally had every action scene and included all the interesting shots. It's like I was watching a 2 hour long version of the trailer, what a fail. There was nothing amazing about the amazing spiderman, I defiantly would not recommend wasting your money on it. Instead, just keep rewatching the 4 minute trailer! Much more entertaining!",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
nice,"as admirer of Andrew Garfield, it is difficult to say something bad about this film. soft, nice, it can be an useful introduction in Spiderman universe. great cast, decent special effects, few slices of humor, it is not waste of time but, in same time, far to be amazing. sure, idea of confrontation between red - blue hero and a version of Godzilla is new piece of old game and the fight scenes are example of deja - vu. so, after all, it remains a little question - why an another Spiderman ?or, more precise, why a new series ? it is clear, the scriptwriter can realize four- six parts but it is not exactly a question about imagination but about sense. result - a nice-strange film. for kids for some viewers. for the Garfield CV for others. or, only, for discover the perfect Spiderman who can be Peter Parker.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Other perspective...,"I mean, the history is obviously 'cause the movie keeps on the original Spiderman, but from other perspective. If you didn't see the others three Spiderman movies, you CAN see this one, it's like other beginning and it keeps on the history line. With that said, let's point to point. Characters: They make a good job, they're really good actors for the movie itself. About the new Mary Jane, I mean Gwen Stacy (Emma Watson), what can I say, she is just beautiful, for my, more beautiful than Kirsten Dunst, and she's an excellent actor, so is a full character, full with personality. Talking a bit to Andrew Gardfield (Peter Parker), he's not so different to Tobey Maguire as a character, I mean, they are very similar as actors.

Spider-Man Swings Again,"Okay, well, going in I really had my doubts about this movie. I had enjoyed the previous Sam Raimi/ Tobey Maguire/ Kirsten Dust ""Spider-Man"" films (even the largely maligned ""Spider-Man 3"" (2007) was not without it's appeal) and I felt it was pretty redundant to retell Spidey's origins just ten years after they were depicted in the massively successful ""Spider-Man"" (2002).However, I was pleasantly surprised. The origin story, while it covers all the familiar bases (nerdy teenager Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is bitten by a genetically modified spider and develops super-powers, his beloved Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) is shot in a street robbery convincing Peter to become a super-hero, he develops his powers by trial and error and eventually assumes his Spider-man identity), is dealt with in more detail than in the previous film version and it is different enough so that it still feels fresh. The film's principal villain, Doctor Curt Connors (aka The Lizard) is well portrayed by Rhys Ifans and Emma Stone makes for an engaging love interest, even if she is not really given enough to do. Andrew Garfield is great as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, giving a lanky agility to the role. His Peter Parker is much less of a nerd than Tobey Maguire's version, and feels closer to the character in the comic-books.The special effects are pretty impressive and it all looks great in 3D and IMAX.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Another money-spinner swings into view,"It seems that the world can't get enough of super-heroes and it's a genre that I always find fun but, after three Spider-Man movies with Sam Raimi as director and Tobey Maguire in the arachnid persona and an interval of five years since the last film, it seems that it's time for a re-boot. So now Marc Webb (""(500) days Of Summer"") takes on the directorial duties and British actor Andrew Garfield (""The Social Network"") spins Peter Parker's webs and the storyline goes back to the beginning with a reprise of the spider-biting incident and the death of his uncle.We have a new baddie in the guise of Rhys Ifans who, after his charming arrival in ""Notting Hill"" seems to have adopted the frequent role for British actors of being the unpleasant character in an American movie (see also ""The Five-Year Engagement""). At least Emma Stone, who was in ""Spider-Man 3"". has made progress with a larger role as Peter's girlfriend Gwen (who unfortunately has a police chief as a father). Even Spider- Man creator Stan Lee is back with his usual cameo (look out for the music teacher).All involved - especially Garfield - acquit themselves well - and the special effects are fine (I saw the movie in its intended 3D), but there is really nothing new or special here.

Decent enough...,"I had a chance to watch The Amazing Spider-Man today. It is a decent movie by all means, but I couldn't understand the decision by the studio to reboot the near perfect series about the same super hero.Since, this is a review of the present film, I will stick to this movie and try not to compare this with the older one starring Tobey Maguire as Spider Man.The movie depicts Spider-man as more human than a superhero. Peter Parker is just another kid, who's parents are missing since the time he remembers. He treats his guardians like dirt making the character believable. The scene where he starts playing the ""Bounce"" game on his mobile while waiting for the villain to appear is epic. Marc Webb, as the director hit goldmine with respect to the character building.The villain is not believable though.The visuals are very good. Again, Marc's insistence on not using the CGI for aerial shots of the Spider-Man in favor of using stunt men physically swinging worked wonders. The whole effort put in shows on the screen. 3D adds more depth to the visuals.The final showdown between the Spider-Man and Lizard, however is the downside of the film.

A thrilling and exciting film,"well nice acting,nice effects,good changes, yes I tell you that you must see the film. The ending's weak but still it's a nice film. Their where many things which have changed and really it's THE UNTOLD STORY. I want to see it's sequels but they're in 2014 and 2016, the credits end is good in which the MAN IN SHADOWS appears.. The costume of spider man is better and the fights are good. The fastest reboot makes a delightful smile in my face, and was worth a watch. The adults will also enjoy the film, plus this movie is really batter than spider-man 3 and the others. They even put characters from many countries to get the fullest advantage.A little plain at first, but it's a good movie in which you can comfortably sit and enjoy the funny parts.A really'AMAZING' film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The Web Sticks, Perfectly","This, ladies and gentlemen, is how you reboot a franchise within a decade of the original and still make loads of money. There was no particular reason to fire Tobey Maguire and Co. for a new Spidey flick (except that you'd have had to show him with little Spidey-babies next), but boy how supremely pleased we are that it turned out so. The Amazing Spiderman is not necessarily a better movie than its predecessors, but it's bolder, wackier and hell, cooler. You feel a kind of energy that had been on the wane ever since Doctor Octopus had met his doom.Andrew Garfield is Peter Parker Ver#2, who looks like he could devour the Tobey Maguire-Parker, the shy, nerdy awkward guy with major self- esteem issues, and spit him out. The upgraded Parker is an aggressive being, extrovert, rebellious and sure of himself. He is back to being sixteen here, a regular high school kid with skateboarding skills and an antennae out for the opposite sex. Particularly for one Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), who shares his love for science and breaking rules. Of course, Parker has unresolved parent-issues too, like Batman, and Superman, and Iron-man, and Thor, and Bruce Banner, and Wolverine One fine day, Mary and Richard Parker (Embeth Davidtz and Campbell Scott) pack up their stuff and leave little Peter in the hands of Uncle Ben and Aunt May (""Someday, you'll understand""). Right. So anyway Little Parker grows into Garfield, stumbles upon his father's old suitcase containing some Beautiful Mind-sort of equations, and begins to investigate. You know the deal, he gets bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and pretty soon he's beating up random people in a subway train, scaling walls and leaping and bungee-jumping in tights. His investigation into his parents' disappearance puts him on a head-on collision course with his father's former research partner Dr. Curtis Connors (Rhys Ifans), a scientist who seems to carry with him an unhealthy amount of secrets. This guy is one-armed and injects himself with some green-liquid (always a bad idea) thinking it'd sprout back the missing arm. It does, and as a bonus, also gives him a tail, fangs, and for all purposes transforms him into Godzilla's intelligent midget-cousin.Meanwhile, Spiderman swinging around is generating videos on YouTube, and Captain Stacy (Dennis Leary) of the New York Police Department is not happy about it. He deploys ""five-hundred"" police officers on Spidey's tail. Guess there had been nothing much for the NYPD to do since Bin Laden died and all. But, what's this? Captain Stacy is Gwen Stacy'sI'll leave out that part. Miss Stacy, of course has by then fallen head over heels in love with Parker for no apparent reason, and the two spend a significant portion of the movie breathing down each other's necks. No upside down smooch-storm in this case though, guess Tobey scores one over Garfield there.Dr. Connors thinks he'll be awarded the Nobel Prize for Saving Humanity if he upgrades us all into giant lizards. Spidey finds his lair, and deduces what the Good Doctor/Hyperventilating Lizard is up to and races to stop him.All well and good. Garfield (The Social Network) is the heart and soul of the movie, and gives us a cocksure hero who has no qualms about showing off his superhuman powers in college or venting his anger at the soft-spoken Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen). Nevertheless, his interpretation of Peter Parker is likable and stuffs in enough emotion to make us root for him. Stone has Stacy doing a bit of running around herself even as she plays the damsel-in-distress. The supporting cast comprising of heavyweights Sheen, Leary, Sally Field and Irrfan Khan do a neat job weighing up the story.The Lizard, well, he is big, mean and has anger-issues, yes, but he doesn't make an entirely menacing villain. Most importantly, his motivations to do all that bad stuff he's doing is not convincing. The movie is not without other flaws too. One-of-the-best-scientific-minds- in-the-city walks calmly into a sealed room that he'd seen a man come out of wearing bio-hazard suit just moments ago. The Oscorp Industries' skyscraper has kindergarten-level security in place that any teenager can break into and walk out with his hands full. Obese crane-operators can operate heavy machinery in a section of the city that has been evacuated by what seems to be the SWAT team. And the movie contradicts itself several times on the issue of 'spider-sense'.However, I am impressed. The movie looks good, and feels good. The casting is spot-on, and the chemistry between Garfield and Stone is nothing sort of nuclear. Peter's motivation to take up the red-and-blue suit is better explained. He is not a man without flaws of his own, and makes mistakes, inventing Spider-man as he goes along.Mark Webb (500 Days of Summer) makes sure the movie does not take itself too seriously, and therein lies his success. Like Joss Whedon before him, he wisely stays away from too much realism. It's a good ol' fashioned battle of Good vs. Inexplicably Evil, with just the right dose of humor and teen-romance.Bottomline: Go see it, if only to satiate your tingling spider-sense.

A reboot elevated by great performances and strong direction,"Around two and a half years ago I heard the announcement of a Spiderman reboot; my initial reaction was less-than-enthusiastic - ""too soon...what's the point?"", I thought; but after the disappointing mess that was Spiderman 3, I realised that maybe it might not be so bad after all. I found Marc Webb to an unusual but interesting choice, but aside from that, everything seemed to come together nicely for the film's production; the perfect casting and even my delightful joy at the faithful inclusion of Gwen Stacy and Peter's homemade web-shooters. However having thoroughly enjoyed the first of Raimi's and loved the sheer brilliance of the second, I still remained somewhat worried about how this early reboot would pan out. Thankfully, even if unnecessary (I suspect Sony just made it to keep the rights) it turned out better than expected.Much of the pure enjoyment of this film stems from the wonderful casting of Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone as Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy respectively. Their scenes together are a particular pleasure to watch; their beautiful chemistry and the manner their lines spark off each other convey the awkwardness of youth to the effect where it left me smiling widely. They are undoubtedly the heart of the film; its beating centre which provides the film with life and emotion. They charm, we root. After being so great in Never Let Me Go and The Social Network, Garfield does not disappoint; doing a wonderful job of making the dual role his own, proving that he is indeed one of the most capable and talented actors under 30 today. Stone continues to impress after a line of great performances, working marvellously alongside Garfield. A scene between her and Dennis Leary concerning cocoa (really) provides one of the film's best comic beats. It is thanks to these performances that nothing in the film feels forced or out-of- character.It's pretty much a fact that Spiderman has a poor back catalogue when it comes to villainy; and when the lizard was first announced as the chief antagonist, I felt he'd be at odds with the film's promised ""realism"" and even feared he may turn out worse than the Power Rangers reject that was the Green Goblin in Raimi's first, yet Rhys Ifans, oddly refusing to betray his Welsh accent, delivers a strong performance as Curt Connors, if not the Lizard. He proves to be quite likable for the film's first half, and even though the seeds of tragedy are there for his metamorphosis, his inevitable transformation was somewhat rushed, which never allows them come to poignant fruition. The Lizard does indeed look ridiculous and it almost, but doesn't quite work.""The untold story"", the publicity proclaimed; maybe next time, fellas, because of course, they are similarities to Raimi's first chapter; the basics are all there - high school, love interest, Flash, Uncle Ben, the cheap mask, etc. But thanks to assured direction and brilliant casting (Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben!), it somehow manages to be exciting and emotional, even if not entirely new. James Horner's score was nowhere near as memorable as Elfman's though.This is a superhero film slightly odd in the fact that it is just as good at portraying human relationships than sweeping set-pieces, not that the action is inherently bad, it is mildly enjoyable, but some of the tender character moments are the film's true highlights, elevating it wonderfully. I was genuinely surprised by the fact that I liked it; it was a fairly enjoyable comic book film with strong emotional resonance. Yet, while easily better than Spiderman 3, and even better than the first, Spiderman 2 is still the amazing Spiderman.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Quite a cool and new Peter Parker but not quite a Peter Parker,"The Amazing Spider-Man is not the movie that I had expected at all. Yes of course I wanted Spider-Man 4 or something with Tobey as a Spider-Man and Kirsten Dunst in it. They made the Spider-Man series look so good and classic except for the Spider-Man 3 which could not go with the flow of the former two prequels. In this movie, Emma Stone looked like Andrew Garfield's older sister. She looked amazing and did good job though.When I heard about it first months ago, I wasn't even interested at all. Then before its release I watched the trailer on you-tube and some scenes of the movie (car thief and the basketball scene to be precise). I had some urge to watch it and got curious, well at least for the special effects and for the whole newness of it; my hate for somebody's effort at overwriting the original Spider-Man was still there and it is still there. There are some scenes which are quite amazing and quite a treat to watch but again there are many scenes that reminded as if you are watching a spoof movie. One particular scene reminded me of that famous scene from the movie Psycho. It seems a deliberate attempt but it felt odd. And probably spoof film makers will find a lot to spoof.Spider-Man is my favorite superhero. I always in a way relate to Peter Parker, the older Peter Parker of Spider-Man series; this one felt a lot different, not in a bad sense though but it feels the older one was more a Peter Parker than this one. But it's definitely new and people like watching new. However people may criticize it, at least Spider-Man fans will watch it anyway. I'm happy that I watched it and might even watch it once again to reconsider my doubts. Like I said there are a lot of downsides, it's got its good sides as well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Even as a Spider-fan, impossible to hate for a movie fan","I've been a Spider-man fan my whole life. The whole deal, comics, action figures - you name it. So, needless to say, I generally disliked Raimi's movies. The first was sub-par, the second slightly better, the third nightmarishly horrific. I went into this movie knowing that they had put the Lizard as part of the origin story and I was prepared to dislike it.The Lizard has never been a great villain - along the lines of sandman and the vulture. But they nailed him in this movie. It worked. Rhys Ifans was perfect.Gwen Stacie has always concerned me as a character for movies, because her death in the comics was always so tragic, but considering this is a new universe, they could have her live so it might still work. Emma Stone played her well.Andrew Garfield was incredible.The story worked. There were some issues, but they were so inconsequential it's not even worth bringing up.What I'm trying to say is if you are a true Spider-man fan, and you have become slightly afraid of Spider-man movies because of how terrible they've been in the past - this one is safe.

"A new Spider-man SLINGING in for ""The Amazing Spiderman""","Approximately 5 years since the making of the third and final Tobey Maguire ""Spider-man"" film, Andrew Garfield is the next actor to hit the stage, with a new story, villain, and lover.After a school excursion, Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider, giving him superpowers similar to those of a spider (including amazing instincts, super strength and the ability to climb up walls). After receiving this power, he attempts to use it to his advantage, but after the death of a close relative, he undergoes a period where he seeks vengeance, before progressing to a goal to protect others.Easily the best ""Spider-man"" film since 2002, the first of the Tobey Maguire legacy, the film features an amazing line-up of actors with Andrew Garfield playing Spider-man/Peter Parker and Emma Stone playing Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker's love interest. The two perform spectacularly together, with an obvious attraction between both actors and characters. The CGI for The Lizard (Rhys Ifan - the antagonist of the film) is also extremely well done, making him seem all the more realistic. The return of ""Spider-man"" is definitely not to be missed.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""With great power, comes great responsibility "" is clearly missing !!!","The Amazing Spiderman , a reboot on Spiderman franchises, was disappointing with nothing much to offer except for few good fight scenes and eye catching visual effects.The Amazing Spiderman takes you to the actual origin of what really happened before Peter Parkar turned into a web slinging hero for the New York City.Director Marc Webb(500 days of summer) does a decent job of re-booting the series showing the disappearance of Peter Parker's parents and what led him to become a Spiderman. But a bountiful of comparison will definitely come across from the fans who have already seen the scenario in Sam Raimi's version. First of all , the questions comes to my mind was why they decided to reboot , considering it got released just after 5 years.. they could have continued with Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire ? Can it been even called a reboot , considering we have seen this before , right ? As I mentioned , the comparisons will definitely happen and I loved Raimi's version. I think he gave more weight-age to the story , character development, more fun-loving and Tobey Maguire was more charming than Andrew Garfield as Spiderman , frankly speaking. I did not understand few scenes here .. if Peter gained strength after bitten by a spider, his eyesight should also become strong, where as he is wearing specks even after becoming Spiderman... the character of Mary Jane and Harry Osborn is also missing here, the story of his parents missing is still clueless. May be all these will be answered in the next chapter for which we have to wait. Gosh, how many spiderman movies they are gonna make... in my opinion, they should have continued the next series. However , on the positive note - the visual effects are mind blowing coupled with fight sequences between Spiderman and the Lizard in the college was high-octane. Screenplay is tight. Camera-work is just getting better and better with each film. The famous dialogue "" With great power, comes great responsibility "" is missing. Andrew Garfield was just about OK as Peter Parker , I felt Tobey Maguire did better job. Emma Stone was not upto the mark. Rhys Ifans was impressive as Dr. Curt Connors but frankly speaking the character of Lizard was more funny rather than scary.

Disappointing after how Great the Raimi Trilogy was,"I just finished watching the Raimi Trilogy of Spider-Men films in preparation for No Way Home and decided to jump straight into the Garfield films, I had never realised before though that this film was so similar to the first Raimi film, just a bit worse. I actually like some aspects of the film, the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone is fun and I thought there was an interesting change in the usual format with the relationship between their characters, as well as that I like the special effects which are a vast improvement over the original trilogy, the big failure is the villain. I like Rhys Ifans and I think he makes the most of what he's got but after how good the villains were in the Raimi films, all more victims of circumstance than evil people with amazing costume designs and great dialogue and when you go from that to the lizard it feels like a let down. The original films were so full of heart and chock-a-block with memorable scenes and great moments and The Amazing Spider-Man just doesn't live up to it. It's not terrible but no where near as good as the first three films.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not an amazing spiderman flick,This movie was not creative in terms of writing which I feel everyone was expecting of the Spiderman Franchise especially after the Spiderman 3 love story. There were loop holes in the plot and the director hasn't given enough time for the story to develop like e.g. All Peter parker had to do is take his fathers formula remember and give it to Connors and without verifying the formula in anyway Connors decides to put it in the system or even how Peter starts discovering his powers(Seriously in a train doing all that stupid stuff). How immature was that? More focus is on the high end animation and graphics which was truly amazing.Good break for Emma Stone as she was refreshingly good in the movie. Andrew Garfield looked lost all over the movie.

Spider-man!!! Exactly what a superhero movie should be,"I've seen the original (2002) spider man, I've seen Tom Holland's Spider Man. This is the best Spider-Man movie, in my humble opinion. Andrew Garfield brings emotion and humor to spider-man, and makes him relatable and funny to teens, even 10+ years later. Emma stone is great too, and their romance feels very real and has the audience rooting for them from the start. There is just the right amount of emotion without offsetting the plot, and in 2024, I freaking love this movie!! The effects, the characters, the moral dilemmas are all awesome. Give it a watch!!

Short Review,"The main actor for SM was much better than Toby. They girlfriend was a lot better looking than Kirston Durnst. But the fact of the matter was that the script was terrible. There were a few bit and pieces of action but the main story was a love story or no story. I would recommend you go see the Avengers again or wait for Batman. Or just rent it. I almost fell asleep. I have most likely seen 90% of every movie ever made and am a huge fan of superhero films. Saw the Avengers 3x in one week. This film is a total yawner. The main villain is just hard to believe and was poorly cast. Special effects were OK, sound was OK. I was forced due to times to see it in 3D which I hate.

Better than I expected,"It's not that I thought the film would be bad that I had never seen it until now. I just didn't think it would be anything more than merely OK. As it is, it's in the same level as the first Raimi one. Andrew Garfield makes a fantastic Spider-Man, for me this is the most obvious improvement. I also liked this film's origins and backstory, since it also takes longer for Parker to develop himself as Spider-Man and because of this the action takes longer to develop. But I think its the main villain that is the most obvious flaw here, and has nothing on Raimi's Green Goblin. Everything else though is on par and in many ways I prefer this version.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Good Start To The New Series, But It Has It's Problems (SPOILERS)","I think firstly it's my duty to say that I haven't seen Sam Raimi's Spidey trilogy fully and completely. As a matter of fact the only film I have seen from that trilogy is about a third of the first one when it was broadcast on ITV2 some 8 or so years ago. As you can probably gather, if an 8 year old me had no interest in the series, then I do have doubts about its credentials. However; I'm not one to hold grudges against films, and I'm sure I'll revisit the series a few years down the line. What I'm trying to say to you is I popped my cherry (metaphorically I assure you, I'm a 16 year old male,) on the Spidey franchise with Marc Webb's 'The Amazing-Spider Man.' Overall, I found the film enjoyable and entertaining, but did have problems that kept it reaching the same high mark for superhero films that 'The Avengers', also out this year, has set.Undoubtedly the best thing about this film is the performances from the two leads in the film, Andrew Garfield (Peter Parker / Spider-Man) and Emma Stone (Gwen Stacey). It's fair to say that Garfield's performance is not close to surpassing his incredible role as Eduardo in 'The Social Network', but that is certainly not a criticism. His performance is well-rounded, believable, and his ability to play adolescent so perfectly is certainly one of the best in the business right now. Similarly, Emma Stone is again very believable and the pair has a certain dynamic, an on screen connection, which is incredibly satisfying for the audience to watch as the narrative progresses.The films plot at times does seem to be somewhat formulaic, but the very nature of the Spidey franchise means that some conventions must be followed: i.e. fans would be outraged if the scene in which Peter Parker gains his special abilities via a spider bite isn't shown, or if Peter doesn't have a love interest throughout the film. Despite these conventions, it's ultimately the films plot that is its greatest downfall: it's littered with unanswered and unmentioned plot strings. For instance, (SPOILER) Peter's chase for his uncle's killer is completely left unanswered mid-way through the film, and a shot is shown of the NYPD officers (SPOILER) being covered in slime created by 'The Lizard' which turns people into 'Lizard People.' There is simply one shot of the officers being covered in this slime, and what follows isn't developed whatsoever. Damn, they even have the guts to show the officers transforming back into humans after (SPOILER) Spidery sprays an antidote across the city. Not only does the plot make the film not cohesive and often bewildering for the audience, it undoes the work by Garfield and Stone of making the film so believable for the audience.The film is visually acceptable. The ending set piece is satisfactory visually, and the audience get just the right amount of POV web-swinging shots to leave them satisfied and not left with motion sickness. The effects on the villain of the film (The Lizard) are often quite plain and standard, but never become a big issue for the film. What does however; is the character himself. The villain, played by Rhys Ifans is simply not interesting and well developed as he should be to become genuine threat to Spider-Man. All we have to look at in comparison is 'The Joker' and 'Bane' in Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy to see how lacking this villain really is. This comparison may be unjustified, but that's the nature of what superhero films are becoming nowadays - a well respected genre which is starting to release outstanding films on a yearly basis, and although 'The Amazing-Spider Man' does have many positives, Spidey doesn't quite live up to the standard of other superhero films over the past decade.3/5.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Unoriginal but enjoyable.,"Ah, reboots. I kinda saw this coming, but I didn't expect it to basically ignore the previous franchise. You don't need to tell the entire origin story again; just give us the basics. Garfield is /definitely/ not able to pull off being a high-schooler, but this doesn't take away from the movie. Emma Stone may not be at her most attractiveness, but she and Garfield have wonderful chemistry. Much better than Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst failed to have.The Lizard is also an improvement on the previous villains.

One of the best Superhero movies. Hopefully it gets an editor's cut like SM3.,"I don't understand how this gets so much hate, I enjoyed it a lot more than Spider-man 1/3 and Tom Holland's entire trilogy. Some of those movies have so many flaws like MJ having an insane grip strength to a ledge, being a bad girlfriend, ruining SM1's origin in SM3, etc. Tom Holland's just seem like they're more for children who don't know anything about Spider-Man comics, and that's ok, but they're not for me. The Lizard is a little one dimensional and could have been written better but Spider-Man's origin is well done and the action sequences are some of the best in the franchise. Gwen Stacy is another plus. She is soooo much better than MJ, she actually risks her life for Spidey instead of being a damsel in distress.

A Different Take On The Spider-Man Story!,"The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) is an Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie directed by Marc Webb with a screen time of 2h16m.This film is a reboot of the original (Spider-Man (2002) - Tobey Maguire) story, starring Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man this time around.Andrew Garfield is a pretty good actor, but I'm not sure if the role suits him. The chemistry between Andrew Garfield & Emma Stone is cringy and cute, but my favorite actor from this movie is Denis Leary as Captain Stacy.The film has its good parts (the score is on point, lovely editing, the shoots look beautiful, I like the Spider-Man costume), but it just doesn't live to the expectations that the original Spider-Man series created.The plot is NOT witty enough. I think the action scenes are too long, and that this movie is trying to show a lot of things, but it ends up creating many sub-plots that just get left in the air instead of putting more time in the things that actually matter. The FOCUS is not very clear...it drags the movie down.TL;DR: Is The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) a good movie? This movie tries to be more realistic compared to the original Spider-Man films, it has its ups and downs, but I think it's an alright, enjoyable movie!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
You seriously think I'm a cop in a skintight red and blue suit?,"As a big fan of the Spider-Man character, I think this is an underrated interpretation. With strong performances by its cast, an interesting spin on the Spider-Man origin story, and very well-made action set pieces, The Amazing Spider-Man thrills while also carrying a healthy dose of emotion.If you've seen 2002's Spider-Man, you're probably already familiar with how Peter Parker (this time played by Andrew Garfield) becomes the webslinger and why he works so hard to save people. This reboot follows some of the same beats as Raimi's first iteration (unpopular high school kid, dead Uncle Ben, rejection of the love interest at the end), but it carries enough differences to make it work. For example, while yes, the villain is green again (the Lizard/Curt Connors, played by Rhys Ifans), the character is so different in terms of personality and motivations from the Green Goblin that we engage with him, even as he descends into lizard-fueled mania.Another big difference between this film and the 2002 version is in its portrayal of Peter. Normally the character is portrayed as awkward, pretty dorky, and shy around others. This movie portrays Peter more as the rebellious type, sometimes stepping out of line with May and Ben, less afraid to put bullies in their place (and sometimes failing miserably), and being slightly more confident around girls. I personally found this tweak to work really well, as he acts more like an actual teenager than Tobey Maguire's take (even though Garfield was around 30 when this movie came out). As briefly as he held the role, Garfield made the character his own while still retaining the fun, quippy nature of Spider-Man.One of my favorite things about this film is the Peter/Gwen relationship. Gwen Stacy was Peter's first girlfriend in the comics, and they managed to really bring the character to life in this film. She's brainy, cunning, and able to match wits with Peter, and her interactions with him are always fun to watch. Emma Stone delivers a great performance, and she and Garfield's strong dynamic can be felt in every scene the two share.Another favorite element of this film is its darker atmosphere compared to the original. This movie is very similar to Batman Begins in terms of tone, and it's felt immediately from the opening notes of the main titles and the beginning flashback to Peter's childhood with his parents Richard and Mary. I found the mystery surrounding his parents' disappearance along with its connection to Oscorp to be very fascinating, and it gives the film a sense of weight and narrative tissue that wasn't seen in the original series. The darker approach carries over to the action scenes, as they have a certain grit and realism to them that sets them apart from other action set pieces. That's not to say there aren't plenty of Spider-Man caliber moments of hilarity though.It's sad that the Amazing Spider-Man series only lasted two films, but at least we were graced with this film in the meantime. Give it a watch, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Genetic Splicing,"Watching this after ""Dark Knight Rises"" is like moving from Saudi Arabia to Monaco.One is the vision of one man through close, very close collaborators. It takes chances, risks darkness. It has motion and noise, but as part of the world we happen upon.This is the product of a production committee. No one wants to do anything that matters; the goal is to have a the tastiest candy on the block. It takes no chances. It has noise and motion not because of the world we visit, but because the channel we see that world through imposes it on us. The colors are primary. The grunge, where it appears seems to be decals applied to smooth unshadowed surfaces. It has nothing that cannot be found on any other committee- populated shelf.There are two things I noted. They both kill all the fathers. But Batman peppers the world with adult sex of a few different kinds. The way this is woven (the sex and the fathers) is how we encounter the weave in real lives: confusingly entangled. Sure, the Catgirl suit and its corset registered in one familiar way, but the manner of the girl was hardly the conventional model (waif or seductress).On the other hand, Stan Lee's girl was about as sexless as possible. The fatherlessness in this case drives the superhero's soul into a different type of emptiness than Bruce Wayne's condition does, one more monastic. I believe that the world of viewers may be equally divided on which is the more superficial.The other thing concerns a criticism I have noted in many previous Marvel films, but especially the Raimi projects. They just don't understand how to use the third dimension. The first three were lost opportunities to spatially thrill. Now, well after some exciting techniques have appeared in big films, they finally capitulate and use state of the art dimensional flight. I believe the problem was the the original comics did not understand this either all Marvel worlds are flat, and fidelity to the comic vision was paramount.But here they do what everyone else is. And that is the problem. They parceled action scenes out to different effects houses and bought every motion technique on the shelf. So we get a hodgepodge of space, depending on who the production crew was for each segment. I saw this in IMAX 3d. The whiplash was extreme, not from the spatial effects — many of which were fine. But from the shifts in how the space was constructed.Like eating ice cream and tasting steak, then coconut, then tar.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Solid adaptation of the iconic character.,"This film is just, fine. Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Peter Parker captures a shy, nerdy teenager. He may look old for the part but he plays the character very well. The rest of the cast is quite good. The villain was weak. The connection to Peter's father should've been explored, maybe even Connors knowing Peter as a child and finding out he was Spider-Man conflicted with his Lizard persona. It would've added depth to the villain and wouldn't have made him a throwaway villain. The pacing of the film was good, didn't find myself getting bored at any moment of the film. The CGI was pretty great, especially for 2012 as it looked more realistic than most of the CGI from Homecoming. The physics of the swinging was spot on. The soundtrack is something that isn't mentioned about this film, but it should be. It's great and adds to the movies action scenes and it's just beautiful. Overall, this movie, like i said before, is just 'fine'. It's not perfect and I can see that Raimi die-hard fans will not find satisfaction in it, but as someone who loves the Raimi films and grew up with them, I really enjoyed this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
How much is too much?,"Again, in my opinion this is another movie that should not have been made. I love super hero movies, especially Spiderman. I really enjoyed the older movies with Toby. Now a new hero and it all just seemed to go toes up for me. I did not enjoy this movie. I really hate remakes and extensions of movies unless they stay close to the original and carry off the heart of the original movie, like Pirates of the Caribbean, like Spiderman 2 and 3 with Toby. They did not feel like a new movie, they were an extension of the one we loved. Some movies are just done to death and the changes in actors just seems to sour things for you. I think this is what happened with this movie for me. It becomes a completely different beast then the original. I am no way saying this movie was bad. It was a good movie, it just ruined the whole Spiderman hero for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good Reboot Despite Some Issues,"Reboot of the Spider-Man series without Sam Raimi is surprisingly good, even with its flaws. It's a little more emo than I would prefer my Spider-Man. It also suffers from a sense of familiarity, being an origin story released ten years after the first movie already did that. Of course, they change a lot between that version and this but the gist is the same. I will say that no ""With great power comes great responsibility"" is a huge fail. On the plus side, it has a great cast. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have a believable, likable chemistry. Garfield's Peter is a bit more of a jerk than I am used to seeing or reading, but I will chalk that up to them trying to make him more ""real."" Realism is the enemy of fantasy but unfortunately, many filmmakers who tackle comic book movies don't get this. The direction is nice, especially considering Mark Webb is new to this kind of movie-making. The effects are so-so but the movie takes place mostly at night, which is a convenient way for them to utilize spotty CGI. Unfortunately, that also lends to the overall dark tone the film has. I don't view Spider-Man as a dark character so the navel-gazing gets old after awhile. Still, if you're a fan of comic book movies and Spider-Man in particular, I doubt you'll regret watching this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good,"Having pros and cons, I analyze it as more pros than against! The script is very cool, with good development, with reservations in the direction of Marc Webb that he could have had different decisions, but nothing that gets in the way of the good story. The cast is very good with important names like Andrew Garfield in a good performance, not as much as Tobey in the previous films, but I consider him a superior actor, we still have the beautiful Emma Stone in a safe and super efficient performance, we have Sally Field as always very good, and the legendary Martin Sheen and Stan Lee close this very strong team. O Espetacular Homem-Aranha is very good and always deserves to be reviewed.Film reviewed on October 3, 2020.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
decent but maybe too soon,"there are different interpretations of spider-man. original being steve ditko's version and then you have others like the ultimate version. spider-man was always witty but marvel toned it up in the ultimate comics almost similar to deadpool without the crazy violence the red and black suited anti hero would bring to the table, which is a good thing. parker is a clued up smart guy and when he puts on the mask he tones it up ten fold. without the mask he tries his best to stay humble. interesting concept which this movie tries to capture. maybe they should of called this ultimate spider-man and called the toby maguire movies amazing cause it don't make sense if u know what I'm saying. this is a decent movie with some good scenes. all the cast are good ( leary, ifans, stone and garfield etc..) fight scenes always good in a spider-man movie but there just seems to be something missing. cant watch this over and over again unless spider-man fighting lizard. maybe it was released too soon to the rami ones",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The most amazing Spider-Man film ever.,"I just came back from seeing ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and in my opinion is the best Spider-Man film ever made; far surpassing even the Sam Raimi films. What Mark Webb has done is nothing short of amazing. He wiped the grime that was Spider-Man 3 from audiences and, like Chris Nolan, gave him a clean slate and made him exist in a world that is highly plausible and believable at the same time. Everything feels real and it just draws you in. Character emotions, action scenes, well written dialog feels real.Part of the reason why this works is because it feels wholly cohesive. Sam Raimi's films were good in their day, but the felt a little too cartoonish and campy though I liked Spider-Man 2 better than part 1. But Webb gives it a more human angle while setting it in a gritty, contemporary world that is haunting and unforgiving.With all that said, it's the acting that's the most impressive. Andrew Garfield thoroughly sets himself up as a more believable Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He's more agile and full of physical action than the one portrayed by Tobey Maguire as well as more emotional and expressive. We see his anguish, his heartbreak, his anger, his frustrations, and determination. But we also see something that has never been touched upon in the previous films: his inventiveness. How he builds his devices in which to fight crime(as well as guarding his privacy) showcases that and I applaud the filmmakers for exploring that bit of the iconic character. Sam Raimi has never done that.Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy does a lot more than she did in Spider-Man 3. In that film she was nothing more than window-dressing and a substitute for when MJ wasn't available to warm Peter's heart, but in this film,she is really caring about Peter and the build up to their relationship is organic and really natural; something that's been missing in Spider-Man 1 and 2. With such well written dialog between the two characters, you really feel for them; almost as if they were real people despite being fictional characters and this film has that nailed down very well.But no Superhero film would not be complete without a superb villain and Rhys Ifans does an incredible performance as the menacing, giant green monstrous Lizard. I so wanted to see this character portrayed on live-action film and thankfully I got that chance. With such believable and realistic CGI, much better than Spidey 1 and 2(though 2 was incredible in it's depiction of Dock Ock)the filmmakers make him more than a worthy adversary for ol' web head to tangle with. I only wish that there was more banter between them in their alter egos. Though I enjoyed their interactions with each other before becoming enemies, I would've loved it if they had more interaction.I was thrilled by the action. I doesn't feel artificial at all; it feels more organic, especially when Spidey is swinging around town, beating up bad guys, or just simply hanging around. No thanks to the state of the art technology powering the film, it's only used to emphasize the film, not completely dry it.I like The Amazing Spider-Man. No, I LOVE IT!!! The best Spider-Man film ever made. Everyone on board has gave the audience an amazing thrill ride from start to finish while also getting into the character's head. I'm really looking forward to see what Marc Webb and the rest of the gang are spinning for the next film. Kudos to everyone involved, The Amazing Spider-Man is truly amazing.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A matter of preference,"Let me begin by saying I tolerated the Batman movies and only watched two of the original Spider-Man movies and I liked neither. They were too much like Batman for me.I did like Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk (part of that may have been due to Norton's acting), Captain America, and The Avengers.If your likes match up with mine fairly well you will like this movie. It's not perfect. In my opinion Spider-Man movies often have ridiculously hard to swallow villains and this one is no exception.Having said that I thought it was an interesting portrayal of Perter Parker.If you pay attention you'll get why he acts the way he does and that it's caused by the small things happening at the moment but by the larger underlying problem which is pretty clearly spelled out.Movies like anything else are a matter of taste. I liked it and it will be the 1st Spidey movie I see twice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Simply Amazing...Nuff said!,"A decade ago, Tobey Maguire brought everyone's friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man to the big screen in Sam Raimi's blockbuster film, that spawned two sequels and won a legion of loyal fans across the globe...including me! For it was Raimi's 'Spider-Man' that first introduced me to Peter Parker and his world, and for that I will always be grateful to the film...but, there's simply no denying the fact that Marc Webb's 'The Amazing Spider-Man' has FAR surpassed the webhead's original cinematic incarnation!I think the best comparison one can offer for this film is Christopher Nolan's now-legendary Batman reboot, 'Batman Begins'. Much like how 'Begins' reinvented the Dark Knight for a new generation by focusing on a more grounded, character-driven arc for Bruce Wayne...'Amazing Spider- Man' does the same for Peter Parker. This is a Spider-Man one almost feels CAN exist in the real world...a Peter Parker who, while technically still a 'nerd', is no milksop and far from a goody-two- shoes.Andrew Garfield unquestionably deserves the bulk of the credit for the success of this film. He highlights the duality of Peter Parker and Spider-Man as Maguire never did-'Spider-Man' is not just Peter in a mask...Spider-Man is Peter freed from all the restraints of his identity, all the consequences of his actions. The mask of Spider-Man, to Peter, represents the anonymity similarly offered by Internet chat- rooms and forums; a point Garfield has raised in interviews, and which is is reflected throughout the film. His Peter doesn't become a superhero overnight...rather, his is a journey that encompasses the whole narrative of the film until, by the end, we finally see him become the heroic legend we all know and love. Perhaps the most striking difference, at least on a superficial level, between Garfield's Spider- Man and his predecessor, is the fact that this is a Spidey who's liberal with the wise-cracks. He is a hormonal, sometimes annoying, 17 year old and he sure acts like one!Emma Stone and Rhys Ifans deliver solid performances as Gwen Stacy and Dr. Curt Connors respectively. Stone's Gwen Stacy is certainly superior to Kirsten Dundt's Mary Jane Watson from the previous series-she's not just a love interest, but an integral part of the plot, along with her father, Captain George Stacy (Dennis Leary). Ifans plays Connors as a well-intentioned visionary gone astray, literally, as the reptilian monster known as the 'Lizard'...a powerful performance that easily rivals those of William Dafoe as Green Goblin or Alfred Molina as Dr. Octopus from the old series.Beyond the excellent portrayals though, the movie's true strength is derived from an excellent script and some brilliant direction on the part of Marc Webb. While quiet a few liberties have been taken with the source material, Webb manages to stay pretty close to the spirit of Stan Lee's original story. The 'Ultimate Spider-Man' series has also clearly been a major influence, both stylistically and conceptually. While the film is a complete story in itself, there are a few plot threads left hanging...mysteries waiting to be resolved in the inevitable future installments. For now though, Spidey fans all over the world can enjoy this wonderful love-letter to Stan Lee and Steve Dikto's 50 year old creation!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
At least there's no whiny Parker anymore,"I resisted seeing this film for the longest time for two reasons. One, I refuse to encourage or financially validate the remaking trend in Hollywood. Two, the trailer made it look like a Twilight rip-off. But, after being told by two different theaters in one night that the late night showings for Man with the Iron Fist had been canceled, I finally decided to shell out a buck twenty at a redbox for a rental.It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. It was basically a fan service film dedicated to everything that wasn't present in the first three films. First the good changes - Peter Parker is no longer a chronic whiner and as Spider-Man, he is a jokester which adds all the lightheartedness this film needs. Denis Leary nails his performance as Captain Stacy.The rest of the changes was mediocre to flatulent. The worst being the automatic vaccine dispensing computer that took less than 8 minutes to make a completely untested vaccine for a biological compound that specifically targets lizard-based (not spider-based... that's important) genetic mutations.Granted, in any science fiction film you have to make machines do magical things. I mean that's why they call it Science Fiction. There's just so much that's unnecessarily silly and it really depends on your personal ability to suspend disbelief. So go see it and make the choice for yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Does total justice to the marvel comics storyline... Lot better than the earlier movie version....,"For the first time in life I had the privilege of watching a movie before its release and I must say that I was pretty ""Amazed"". Those people who are mentioning that this movie has shades of twilight , they have certainly not read the original storyline of the comics. The romance of Peter and Gwen Stacy was needed because it certainly is going to be very useful in its sequels. The climax fight between spidey and lizard is really a money's worth. I had really not expected much after I came to know that this movie was directed by a person who has just directed one movie and several music videos. If you are the one who had same thoughts then you are truly in for a surprise. Marc Webb has done an excellent work in doing justice to the comic book character of Peter Parker, unlike Sam Raimi. The blend of emotions and action is what makes this movie a great one. Comic book fans will surely understand the reason for Gwen Stacy's romance with Parker. The action scenes are just too great. At times you can feel that you are actually in Spidey's shoes. Andrew Garfield does a fantastic job and just fits in well with the shy , nerdy character of Peter like that in comics , unlike Tobey whom i always found unfit for the role of Spiderman.. From the storyline one might get a hint that Spidey may join the Avengers team next time. But now that's for Marvel to decide. All in All, this is a must watch for everyone (esp. those who are ardent fans of The Amazing Spiderman comic books)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A solid take on the story.,"A new fresh take on the spider-man story. Looking at some of the positives compared to the 2002 version, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone had natural chemistry and Garfield as Spider-Man was a fine choice, with more jokes, truer to the comics. His wiry frame also worked visually as Spider-Man. The special effects are obviously a lot sharper and more realistic than the CGI from 2002 which does look a bit dated now. Emma Stone dances circles around Dunst when she's acting and Gwen's character has far more depth and life than MJ.One negative I thought was that the portrayal of Uncle Ben and Aunt May wasn't as good as the Sam Raimi version and the back story with his parents didn't do much for me, Aunt May is more or less written out of the second half of this film.In contrast to the 2002 version the film switches the focus of Peter's emotional relationship from his Aunt to his girlfriend. Maguire's 2002 portrayal of Peter comes across almost sexless at points, it isn't great for a superhero to be scared of women. When Peter tells MJ at the end he only wants to be friends, Only a friend?"" she asks?. ""That's all I have to give,"" Maguire says....hmmmm. In this version (2012) the chemistry between Peter and Gwen is a little more suggestive, they are meant to be real teenagers after all, not just asexual characters in a kids film, superhero films are no longer made for little children anymore but basically for adolescents and adults these days, The Amazing Spider-Man gets this aspect right.The film made the correct choice by just picking a single villain and giving enough time to develop his story, something the sequel failed to learn from. The music from James Horner complimented the film well too (His last finished work). I think my favourite scene was when Spider-Man saves the boy on the bridge, a point where we see the kind side to Spider-Man's as he gently reassurances the boy in danger. Take note Man of Steel, superheroes need to be protecting and saving people not letting thousands die.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Terrible movie,"Only two things recover it from a one star... the FX and the girl they chose to play Gwen Stacey.Though, really the worst thing is the person they chose to be Spider-Man. Other than bad acting, and no charisma, he is just plain old wrong for the part. Not to mention he reminds me of Hayden Christensen, though at least Christensen is cute.Why are people giving this movie such high marks? I wish I knew.

I'd have been really ticked off if I wasted money on this.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good CGI, but uneven pace of the story","I think the actual story is good in some way at the first half, but I think the movie doesn't present it well enough, mainly because of the pace of the story.

The pace got uneven, and the story got predictable.I'm also not satisfied with Andrew Garfield's performance as Peter Parker. I didn't get any emotional connection to the character - New York's crawling hero, as I did with Tobey Maguire in the Spider-Man trilogy (2002-2007).The CGI was very good in a way, especially the details, but I think the motion of the CGI could have been better, especially when it comes to unnatural movements.James Horner, the movie's composer, did not disappoint, as predicted. He is delivering every time. I can notice his style, and it fits the movie.The movie should have prioritized the story, and not the CGI. Then, I think it would have a better flow.

'Amazing' isn't too much a superlative to describe this perfect blend of drama and action that offers both physical and emotional thrills,"Ten years might seem too soon to reboot a franchise, but after the bloated and lacklustre 'Spiderman 3', going back to basics isn't that bad an idea after all. That's exactly what 'The Amazing Spiderman' does, booting out previous franchise stalwarts Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco for up-and-coming director Marc Webb (with only the indie feature '500 Days of Summer' under his belt) and similarly on-the-up stars Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. It's a bold move all right, but in this instance, one that pays off handsomely in the form of an enormously entertaining blockbuster piece of entertainment that we dare say surpasses the original.To be sure, this isn't quite 'the untold story' that the pre-publicity machine sold it as. Rather, screenwriters James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves (with story credit to Vanderbilt) re-assemble the key elements of Peter Parker's origin story for a fresh new take on the familiar. So once again, Peter is the nerdy and socially awkward teenager who lives with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May, who one day gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and develops superhuman powers, who uses his powers for play until his Uncle Ben gets killed, and then is thrust into a quest for justice to hunt down the killer that ultimately leads him to recognise the responsibility which comes with possessing such powers.Like we said, this is no mere rehash, and both Webb and his team of writers find opportunities at every turn to expand and adjust the little details that make a difference. Parker's father for instance plays a much more central role to the narrative, and the crucial wrestling episode between Parker and opponent Bonesaw McGraw in Sam Raimi's original is reduced with a wink to a brief moment that inspires his Spidey mask. More significantly, Webb tones down the comic-book feel of Raimi's original and goes the way of recent superhero movies by injecting a stronger dose of drama into the material.Though Parker's abandonment issues have always featured in the 'Spiderman' films, Webb's spin on it is by far the most emotionally poignant, drawing an intimate link with Parker's identity crisis that forms the backbone of the story. Indeed, that's also how the film's villain, Dr Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), has been sketched. Both hero and adversary are characters isolated in their own way- two sides of the same coin if you may- not so different from the dynamic between Batman and the Joker in Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'.Nonetheless, fans can rest easy that Webb doesn't take his movie down a similarly dark and gloomy path- instead, there is much cheer and spark in the romance between Parker and classmate Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), who proves to be a much more interesting character than Mary-Jane Watson ever was in three films. That's undoubtedly a result of the chemistry between reel-turned-real life sweethearts Garfield and Stone, but a key difference here is that Stacy is no longer just the sweet girl-next-door but a smart and sassy individual perfectly capable of being Parker's intellectual equal. Their romance has the zing of Webb's earlier 'Summer', and more than justifies why the commercials director was chosen over so many others to take the helm of this movie.Webb also has much fun with Parker's discovery of his newfound superhuman capabilities before the film takes a more decidedly serious tone- and a subway scene where the lanky teenager easily overpowers five other burly men in the same carriage (while ripping the clothes off another lady passenger) is neatly choreographed and adroitly staged. Ditto another where he hijacks a car-jacking thief in action (briefly seen in the trailers), which also marks the start of a tongue-in-cheek move he makes whenever some villain refuses to shut up or confess.In between the intricate webs of romance, comedy and drama, Webb weaves in another layer of action that perfectly complements the earlier elements. The first major setpiece on the Williamsburg Bridge sets the tone for the rest to follow- eschewing all-out spectacle for more emotionally-driven thrills- culminating in a harrowing rescue of a young boy from a burning car hanging off the side of the bridge that proves to be unexpectedly moving. Likewise the climactic sequence set atop a New York skyscraper (similarity to 'The Avengers' aside) has more emotional beats than you would expect- in particular relating to Spiderman's status as a masked vigilante- and ends on a surprisingly sombre note that brings the human dimensions of the tale to a fully satisfying finish.A huge reason why Webb's drama-centric approach works is the excellent casting. There's no other way to describe it than to say that Garfield is brilliant as Parker/ Spiderman. He nails the tongue-in-cheek one- liners, and navigates the character beats between tortured teenager and born-again superhero with admirable ease. We've said this before, but we'd mention it again- his scenes with Stone sparkle with verve. And not unlike Raimi's original, his scenes with supporting leads Martin Sheen and Sally Field provide some of the most heartwarming moments in the movie. To compare Garfield's performance with that of Maguire's is inconsequential really, and it suffices to say that Garfield brings a different, but no less unique, personality to the iconic character.Indeed, the same can be said of the film as a whole, reassembling the familiar elements of Spiderman's origin story into a refreshing blend of action and emotion. Working off the template of Raimi's original and inspired by recent character-driven superhero movies, Webb delivers an emotionally thrilling and adrenaline-pumping blockbuster that counts amongst one of the best Marvel page-to-screen adaptations. And unlike post-conversion efforts, the decision to shoot in 3D ensures that the POV shots of Spiderman swinging down Fifth Avenue or battling the Lizard atop the Oscorp skyscraper are positively vertiginous, adding an additional dimension of excitement especially when viewed in IMAX.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Amazing Peter Parker,"As a reader of comics, I enjoy - and am used to - seeing new creative teams bringing a new vision for iconic characters, but rebooting the Spider-Man franchise a mere five years after Raimi's Spider-Man 3 was released, just felt too soon. By now we know the story of Peter Parker being bitten by a radioactive spider, quite well. Heck, we know it very well! Granted, Raimi's films had a camp tone to them, but it took its characters very seriously. It was this delicate blend that helped create a timelessness to those films, whereas TASM is obviously trying to be 'of its time'. For this reason I fear that in years to come TASM will still live in the shadow of the Raimi films.That said, the first half of the film is a powerful drama on its own merit. 'Spider-Man' aside, the Parker household has enough emotional depth and warmth you quickly find yourself caring for these characters - credit due to a wonderful cast who delivered great performances. Garfield in particular delivers a performance of the frustrated teenager on the verge of young adulthood perfectly.Webb's debut film, 500 Days of Summer, showed that he knows how to capture the emotional highs and lows of relationships flawlessly, and he's done so again with TASM. The film shines brightest when focused on its leads, Garfield and Stone. Their chemistry in undeniable and leaves you begging for more.For a film trying to appeal to modern audiences, visually - it works. Delivering a style edging between the richness of 'Batman Begins' and the glitz 'n glamour of 'Kick Ass'; however, never quite reaching the heights of either.At times, TASM feels tied down by its predecessor. The action is solid, but fails to offer the level of excitement and spectacle crafted in the Spider-Man 2 fight scenes between Spidey and Doc Ock. It also lacks memorable visual narratives as seen in the previous films, and so nothing really stays with you; for instance, Spider-Man 2 manages to sum up the inner conflict of the hero by having Spider-Man's mask torn in two, showing one half as the determined masked hero and the other as the vulnerable Peter Parker - a strong, thoughtful image; something sorely missing in this film. Apart from an inspired Stan Lee cameo, which shows the artistic ingenuity and endearing humour of Webb, as seen in 500 Days, there's not really any 'wow' moments, which is disappointing considering the film is call The Amazing Spider-Man.The trailer promised 'the untold story', referring to Peter's father; however, what we get is the introduction to the untold story. The mysteries surrounding Peter's father and his work are the main drive which sets the story in motion, only for it to come to a complete halt and not be mentioned for the entire second half of the film. It isn't until a sequel baiting, mid-credit scene that this plot is picked up again. Fortunately, they've set up the players well and created a Spider-Man world I look forward to see expanded upon, so a sequel is more than welcome. And in turn, it isn't frustrating that there's 'sequel bait' littered throughout.Although the spectacle of The Amazing Spider-Man is enjoyable but somewhat underwhelming, the film makes up for its shortcomings with its tremendous cast and weighty emotional punch - which is unsurpassed by previous Marvel films. Ultimately, as a standalone film TASM is quite forgettable, and now has to rely on its sequels to deliver the goods in order for this new series to become relevant.Rating: 7/10 as 6/10 seems too low",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I loved the original in 2002 but this was just amazing!!,"Let me start off by saying that I loved the original in 2002 and i had so many doubts going into this movie, I honestly thought it was going to be awful but I am so happy I have been proved wrong!! I own almost all of the spider-man comics and have read them all. I am so pleased with the web shooters, in 2002 they took them away and thats like taking superman's cape away. Organic webbing didn't take place in the comics until around I believe 2004. The casting was excellent, I've never been a fan of Emma Stone but she played Gwen Stacy perfect and Andrew Garfield was born to play Peter Parker, he was excellent. Rhys Ifans did a great job portraying Dr. Connors and Aunt May and Uncle Ben were casted great to. The 3D was pretty good and I was surprised how good the CGI for the Lizard was. It does get a little romantic at some points and that disappointed a few but it wasn't overdone. The action scenes were phenomenal.

Boring movie made by exec committee,"When I saw the trailer I thought it looked like a C grade movie - ya know not too amazing but not terrible. Then I read the reviews which painted it more of a B grade due to the good acting etc. Just saw it last night and I'd say it's closer to D grade. Other than some real chemistry by the two leads and nice nuanced moments, the film was clearly developed and created by Sony executives rather than the writers or the previously very talented director. Marc Webb's 500 Days of Summer was the Amazing movie on his resume, not this horribly realized and surprisingly boring film. Nothing in it worked: not the set pieces where the action itself was very choppy and confusing and worst of all, not engaging or thrilling. My guess is that Sony needed a hit desperately, felt they had the secret to a successful movie learned from the other 3 Spiderman's, and felt they could push around the writers and the action-inexperienced director and what came out was this very poorly realized film on every level. On the one hand I want it to do well because I think the director is very talented and I want him to have enough success to show us how amazing he can really be on future movies, on the other hand, I'm hoping it under performs and forces all would be controlling movie executives to let good writers and directors do their best work and make good movie instead of subjecting us to a Frankenstein's monster of a film like The Amazing Spiderman.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing Spidey Lives Up to Title,"When director Sam Raimi stepped down as director of the Spider-Man movie franchise, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios decided to revamp the film series and take it to a brand new direction. With a new director, new cast and crew, a new story and into ten years forward after the first film, the question was, ""what's the worst that could happen""? In fact, by the way I see it, nothing.Watching The Amazing Spider Man is like seeing an old friend with old stories and new ones to tell. Connect one story to another, put them together and you get one fully-fleshed story in a new perspective.There are changes from the first three films with having no Mary Jane, no J.Jonah Jameson and no Norman Osborne {although he's mentioned a little in this film}. But it is possible to watch this satisfying super reboot without having memories from the 2002 original.Since his parents' death in a plane crash, Peter Parker {now played by Andrew Garfield} has long lived with Uncle Ben {Martin Sheen} and Aunt May {Sally Field}. In high school, he has a crush on Gwen Stacy {Emma Stone} and also, he's a target for bully Flash Thompson {Chris Zylka}.One day, he discovers a suitcase with papers that belongs to his dad. Peter decides to finds out the secrets of his scientist father. To do that, he goes to dad's old job at OsCorp to investigate. While there, he goes into a modified spider lab. But one of the spiders bites Peter. Soon, weird things begin to happen as Peter discovers spider-like powers.Then, one night, tragedy strikes as Uncle Ben is killed by a thief that Peter saw at a grocery store. Peter then decides to take action, so – first with a mask, then the spider costume- he tries to find his father's killer. But the police headed by Gwen's father {Denis Leary} thinks that Peter is a criminal trying to stop thieves.Meanwhile, Peter's dad's former partner, Dr. Curt Connors {Rhys Ifans} is trying to regenerate limbs based on Lizard DNA. He tries to do the experiment on his left limb himself, but soon it makes him grow into a lizard. Peter -who is then now called Spider-Man- soon suspects that Connors is the lizard and he decides to find an antidote before The Lizard turns New York City into a land of non-human species.Director Mark Webb {500 Days of Summer} and screenwriters James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves {Harry Potter film series} makes this reboot stand tall on its own two feet. They take the time well spent in the movie to develop on the story and they handle it well. They even beat a cliché from the original film series in the near end by not having Gwen being trapped by the villain while he fights with Spider-Man.The film even shares some humor when Spider-Man is playing a game on his phone while waiting for The Lizard and when during a fight at school with The Lizard and Spider-Man, a school librarian {played by Marvel comics founder Stan Lee} is listening to some music and never sees and minds the fight.Garfield inherits Tobey Maguire's role and he makes it his own. He put his own spin on the character and turns it into an electrifying, cool web.Stone is radiant and delightful both on the outside and in the inside as Gwen Stacy.Even though the actors are both past college age, Garfield and Stone take their high school characters seriously. The sparks on their romance fly here on screen as on off screen in real life.Ifans is dynamic and sinister as both the large Lizard and the left limbless Connors.Leary's strong policeman role makes a connection with the real life to the issue of having no real superheroes.Field and Sheen hold their roles very well, respectively as May and Ben.The camera work by John Schwartzman gives a remarkable scope to the flying and action sequences and makes the 3D version of the film worth the price of admission.The special effects by Sony Pictures Imageworks does serve the story and succeeds in not having too much of it.James Horner's score makes a fine and modest effort of not copying Danny Elfman's score from the original.The film's moral is about finding about whom you are and what you're really made of. We all connect to that with Peter because we know who we all are not on the outside, but on the inside.This is a perfect example of what a live-up-to-the-hype, powerful summer blockbuster should be. Please stay for the credits for a bonus scene. Trust me. You're gonna get ready for a sequel.Rating: ***1/2Parent Advice: Rated PG-13 for sequences of action and violence.

Decent,"What can I say? It's a Spider-Man reboot. Let's face it, no matter how cool he is, Spider-Man is just not the kind of hero who has a masterpiece movie, he's the kind of superhero that has a movie full of special effects, pretty girls, cheap gags, and one-liners. Andrew Garfeild showed potential, and was amusing to watch, and the always amazing Emma Stone was fabulous as ever. Honestly the story was decent, the acting was decent, the writing was decent. So what can I say besides that it was decent. It was fun, and that's really all Spider-Man can be. Was it as good as the Toby Macguire films? No, not even close. But it is a fun film,with action, suspense, romance, science, and humor. It is moderately clean, providing a superhero film that all ages can enjoy. Like I said though, it's Spider-Man, people who watch it expecting a masterpiece are going to be let down, it just isn't, and no matter how hard people try, Spider-Man will never be a masterpiece, it's what it always has been action, effects, heart, and pretty girls. So watch it, it's fun and pretty cool, but don't expect anything special.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
You need to be a comic fan to appreciate it fully,"Doesn't quite reach the highs of the Sam Raimi films but not bad in anyway. Gets the vibe of a Spider-Man just right which other films fails to do so. The duality of Peter the highschooler and Spider-Man the superhero was very much front and centre even tho not all it does worksFor starters an infinitely better Spider-Man than Tobey Maguire. When I picture Spider-Man from the comics its the closest to Andrew Garfield. Also a very solid Peter Parker but the script lets him down most of the time. The shy, nerdy, quippy and tormented highschool Peter was well handled altho a little less stuttering would've been nice. My only complaint would be Andrew looks older than the age he is supposed to be at times.One of the best chemistry in a Spider-Man movie with Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone who was perfect in the role. Tobey-Dunst felt very artificial whereas Andrew-Emma is so free flowing and organic. Gwen was always my favorite Spidey girl and this movie proves itAction scenes have been vastly improved and altho its still CGI looking it gets the Spider-Man fighting style perfectly. Not the best of casting choices for the villain and the lizard design looked weird trying to make it as realistic as possible.As for the duality aspect it is surprisingly emotional and very well acted for the most part. But the script really doesn't help the actors and the direction also lets it down at timesThere is not much wrong with it its just that its not as good as the 1st 2 Raimi films. Don't get me wrong this is a better Spider-Man movie than all the Sam Raimi films but the Sam Raimi films were better movies. Its just not as tight and cohesive even tho it gets Spider-Man closer than all the other attempts. For all its effort it does lack in iconic moments and doesn't have many nostalgic moments as the Sam Raimi run.RATING: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Meh. Just Meh.,"The Amazing Spider-Man was a simple spider-man movie, this time in the main role as Spider-man they introduce Andrew Garfield, that played him just ok, he played like a Spider-man should be played, but he wasn't outstanding and not so funny as the Tom Holland Spider-man, that I like much better. About the movie, I think it was very dark, made in a very retro-noir style, the dark city of Manhattan and the underground lab scenes, introducing the new villain, a scientist that mutates to a green, slimy Lizard that want to kill Spider-man, the plot drived me on, but I can't say it was so entertaining as it could have been. The movie did have some very clear Spider-man elements, they showed us the story of how he become how he is, but no, it wasn't just what I was expecting to happen. The problem was that the plot wasn't much of it. When everything happen, they just added some action sequences to make it entertaining, but it wasn't much of it. The dark-noir style was interesting at first but later it wasn't so much impressive. The school scenes were Spider-man was just Peter Parker was cool, but it lost that element of teenage genre and his romance between him and his girl, Gwen Stacy, wasn't much convincing. His transformation and his rise of powers did happen to slow and random, he acted like it was a normal thing that happen with everyone. I don't know, I watched this once, and I don't want to watch it again. Random is the right word of describing this movie. Fun at times but was mostly a random superhero flick.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Angsty Spider-Man and Gwen!,"Although we've seen the origin story before, it is a fresh reset with Gwen instead of MJ. I will never get tired of seeing Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield together. Emma is so fun to watch, and the banter between Peter and Gwen is fun.I definitely laughed more at the real teen angst, that is also very relatable to my teen years. It would've been nice to see more ""nerd"" from this portrayal of Peter.I feel like the CGI for Lizard just feels off. That's my major take away.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just really bad,This is not spider-man this is more like a spoof. I have never felt so bored watching a movie. I actually hated peter parker in this movie and spider-man is a joke. Many scenes show his skills and how strong he is but when he is in a real fight he gets toss around like a rag doll. He even gets shot later in the movie where was his spider sense? A very weak movie its nothing like what spider-man should be. Very little action and a lot of nonsense drama that can be confusing at times. The spidey suit in this movie looks horrible and it made the whole movie that much cheesier. They even show peter making the mask and he uses sunglass lenses in the mask. How is he suppose to see at night looking through sunglasses? Maybe thats why is kept getting beat up through out the movie he couldn't see. All in all a big waste of time.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better Than The First,"I watched this movie on DVD, and with high expectations because of recommendations from my friends. While I have to admit that some aspects were disappointing, I was satisfied with the overall quality of this movie.One of the high points of this movie was that character of the hero, Peter Parker. This movie emphasizes his intelligence and interest in science, while the other movies seemed to ignore this. Parker's ability to invent his own web shooters demonstrates this intelligence (it also appeals to fans of the comic books, which never gave Spider-Man organic webbing). However, it isn't surprising that the old Spider-Man couldn't invent his own spider web, as he was too busy taking flattering pictures of himself. This movie also makes Spider-Man more likable by making him more of a hero, and more of a rebel at the same time. The new Spidey is actually motivated to risk his life for reasons other than the bad guy kidnapping his girlfriend. Even his girlfriend is more heroic (she actually risks her life for him for a change!). The new Spider-Man is also a more realistic teenager: he's sarcastic, independent, and not a pathetic rule-abider like the old guy (the most rebellious thing the old Spidey did was dye his hair and snap his fingers at the ladies).I also liked that this movie provides a lot more context to explain Spider-Man's existence and background than the older movies did. Since most people already know that Spider-Man got his powers from getting bit by a spider, it makes sense that the movie should tell us something new.The worst fault of this movie is its occasional lack of originality. There is a bit of overlap from the original movie and although this is unavoidable, it causes a lot of confusion. Some scenes have essentially the same old idea, but are placed in a different setting, which comes off as lazy.There is also a little bit too much similarity between this movie and the Dark Knight. Spider-Man isn't supposed to be ""the hero New York deserved, not the one it needed"", so there is no reason to try and cross the two heroes.In conclusion, The Amazing Spider-Man is a decent movie (but not necessarily all that amazing). If you have already seen the others, it is still worthwhile to watch this one, especially if you are a fan of the comic books. It is definitely an improvement over the original, but it will still remind viewers of the original several times. If this were the first Spider-Man movie, I would rate it 8/10, but I am taking one mark off due to some of the annoying overlap of the original.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Well I was satisfied,"The Amazing Spider-Man tells the story we have all seen before but in a significantly darker tone. Although I won't argue that this feature is better then the Sam Rami Spider-Man trilogy, I still stand by that this movie does things better. These things include acting, character development, and effects. Overall I enjoyed it but I see why people don't.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
lots of hate for this,"I admit I'm not familiar with the story of Spider-Man or the Spider-Man genre. Part of Spider-Man 3 filmed here, and it is amazing how many hundreds and hundreds of people are involved in filming a scene, and we did see how car crashes were accomplished.That aside, I wasn't aware that there were two Spider-Man franchises, Spider-Man and the Amazing Spider-Man. It seems that The Amazing Spider-Man is loathed by people on this board.Andrew Garfield stars here as Peter Parker. He's a quiet kid, not a nerd, just a shy kid with a crush on Gwen (Emma Stone), but one who goes about his business. His aunt and uncle are played by Sally Field and Martin Sheen, both excellent. Peter's father (Campbell Scott) and mother leave the boy with the relatives while they disappear. We don't really know what happened to them, despite a newspaper story that says they were killed in a plane crash.Peter is remarkably intelligent and, after finding his father's old research notes, meets his father's ex-partner, Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans). While nosing around Dr. Connors' lab, Peter becomes Spider-Man when he's bitten by a spider and turns his powers to vigilantism. While experimenting on himself, Dr. Connors goes a bit overboard and turns into a supermutant Lizard. He starts terrorizing New York. It's only a matter of time before Spider-Man and Connors meet.I guess one franchise, comic books, and a Broadway show aren't enough for Spideyd -- there has to be a second franchise as well. The effects are fantastic, as one would expect, and the cast is good. Besides those mentioned above, Dennis Leary is on hand as the police chief and Gwen's father.For what it was, it was entertaining. I'd be interested to see some of the Spider-Man franchise to compare the two.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than Spiderman (2002),"Alright, here is my take. I watched this movie last night and to be honest i could understand why people are being so negative about the movie? When Spiderman (2002) was out, i was about 12 years old and i loved the movie. I am 22 now and i enjoyed watching the remake. I would have enjoyed this much more if i were 12 right now. So i guess people who have been complaining are complaining for the same reason. They do not realize that they are 10 years older now and they no longer enjoy Super hero movies as they used to in their childhood. Also they do not realize that this is the first part, i am pretty sure the next one will be more exciting. One of the things which i liked about this film was that this time they lengthened the ""underdog-beating-up-the-bully"" part. One of the thing which i did not like was the music. I mean seriously the background music did not do the justice to the movie. A serious fight scene must have really thrilling music to compliment it. Which is movie didn't have. Overall it was pretty entertaining. I wasn't disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Andrew Garfield has done it again,"As a fan of Andrew Garfield, it seems that all of the movies I have watched of his were very good, and this one was certainly not a let-down. It may seem that I am biased due to the fact that I admire him, but that is not it at all. My personal opinion is that Andrew did a lovely job as his role of Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Even though he is in his 30s, he has such a youthful appearance that he was easily accepted as a high school student (and I learned that he looks simply endearing in glasses!). I thought that the addition of the skateboard he carried everywhere was especially unique and brilliant. Perhaps I'm not judgemental enough, but I saw nothing wrong with this excellent movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best of the Series,"This is some of the rare moments that new movie is shown a step ahead of the US. Benefit from the young crew, this reboot is refreshing and much more energetic / light-hearted. On visual effects side, this is perhaps the best 3D among all recent titles -- the scenes are not dimmed with 3D effects. The swinging scenes are sharp and not too fast (that you can catch up and appreciate). One tip - as usual - don't sit too close to the screen. That said, the view time is a bit too long, I don't mind to cut it short by 5 to 10 minutes. Honestly, some of the scenes are a bit slow and can be removed. In short, this is a movie you need to view in theater because many of the frames are packed with color and details, and definitely, the swings are a lot more powerful in big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not Amazing But Good,"The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)*** (out of 4)This reboot comes just a short amount of time after the third and final film in Sam Raimi's trilogy and features Andrew Garfield taking over the role of Peter Parker. In this film, Parker is trying to discover the secrets of his parents when he's bitten by a spider, which of course turns him into the title character. Spider-Man must then battle The Lizard while also trying to keep the girl of his dreams (Emma Stone). THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is certainly far from amazing but I think it was good enough for a summer blockbuster. One could argue if it was too soon to start the franchise up but I'll leave that for someone else. Overall I thought the screenplay was pretty good as it mixed in plenty of drama, laughs and some good action sequences. I'm not sure how many mainstream movie goers would agree with me but I thought the high points was the personal drama. The story of what's going on with Parker was extremely well handled and I thought the screenplay devoted just the right amount of time letting us get to know this character. The Parker here is certainly a lot different than previous movies so I'm glad they really built the character up. The same is true with his relationship with Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and even the love story has some good moments to it. The performances are all a major plus as well. Garfield has no problem pulling off both sides of the character and Stone makes for a very good love interest (not to mention the mini skirts on her are great). Denis Leary is terrific as the girl's father who also just happens to be the Captain of the police. Sally Field is strong as Aunt May, although I'd argue that the script doesn't do much for her character. I thought the real standout was Sheen who was simply terrific as Uncle Ben and stole every scene that he was in. Rhys Ifans was okay as the villain but I thought this was the weakest aspect of the film. I must admit that I was bored each time The Lizard was on screen as I didn't find him to be a good villain and the doctor's backstory was also rather boring. I also didn't think there was enough imagination to the action scenes and this is the one spot that was really lacking from previous movies. Still, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is a winner thanks to the screenplay and performances.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Heartwarming, beautiful with fantastic performances. This is Spider-Man!","I will keep it short, because that is what you guys want.

Two thumbs up!Secondly, Emma Stone was great. She embodied Gwen Stacy in a way I never could have imagined. She and Garfield had a perfect chemistry on screen.Finally, the movie itself was beautiful and tear jerking. I almost cried a couple of times.

Enjoyable nostalgia,"It proves problematic analysing this film without comparing it and Sam Raimi's 2002 approach to the same character. These similarities and differences are both detrimental and admirable to Marc Webb's picture.As one of 2012's most anticipated films, 'The Amazing Spider-Man' suffers greatly from it consciousness. Excuse the pun, but the tone during the 136 minutes a certain 'Spidey-sense' about itself; knowledgeable of its existence as a reboot, and not a new trilogy. The unfortunate consequences of this are within the nostalgic narrative, which we all remember from a decade ago. Not only does this film follow the original story, but it's aware of it, causing the evolution of Spider-Man to be rushed as if the director is saying, ""you've seen it before, let's just swing through this part of the story"". There is more to see from this series, reportedly, at least a trilogy, though the first of three could have been condensed into the opening title sequence, as the formulaic story has already been tested once before in cinema by Raimi. Nevertheless, the love story between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey presents itself as more convincing than what we saw from Raimi's films with Mary-Jane Watson. Our female love interest (portrayed by Emma Stone) actually provides the plot with some importance, and does not need to be saved by our hero in the climax as her predecessor (Kirsten Dunst) repeatedly did in all three of Raimi's pictures. In its entirety, the film feels as if it is an introduction to a story, the blurb of your favourite novel, forgotten, because you enjoyed what followed so much more.The angle taken by Webb and the cast can be applauded. The choreography, characterisation and dialogue have successfully adapted to the approach of having Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man whilst still in high school. Andrew Garfield portrays the character as arrogant, rebellious and at time reckless, in both personality and acrobatic style (give credit to his stunt doubles also), hugely contrasting from what we saw from Tobey Maguire. Both actors provide various memorable qualities to the comic book hero, contrastingly so, meaning preference between the two is no clear choice, simply down to opinion. There are a number of factors to consider when selecting a winner. On one hand, 'The Amazing Spider-Man' explores the origin story of the character which is yet to be completely revealed, leaving the anticipation for fans for future sequels. Furthermore, we encounter a far superior romance story between Gwen Stacey and Peter Parker so in terms to Spider-Man's humanity, Garfield's interpretation wins out. However, Maguire simply fits the costume better, and makes for a better Spider-Man. We can contribute much this to his voice and the CGI of the character used by studio. Furthermore, the actually story of Spider-Man just does not feel very heroic this time around. The suit itself though with a warm home- made approach to it, bluntly worded does not look as good as in Raimi's series. Though we shouldn't necessarily judge a hero by his mask right? Well depending on what the mask represents. Any suit, whether it is Captain America's, Batman's or Spider-Man's should be a symbol for what these characters believe in, yet this film explores the use of the suit in a continuous quest for vengeance by the character, consequently signifying less of an American hero as we saw from Raimi. Webbing together what exactly this means; Garfield wins the Peter Parker award, while Maguire wins the Spider-Man trophy, resulting in my personal favouritism leaning towards Maguire.""Who am I?"" The primary theme of identity is highly emphasised by Webb, as the character attempts to deal with a variety of relatable human and superhero problems. He never really does find himself within the film, yet indicates a certain growth in character because of the adversity he faces, often from his own hubris, making him a tragic hero who is required to fathom that ''with great power, comes great responsibility"".There are certainly aspects of this film that are an evident improvement from what Raimi did. Conversely, many components that I adored in the previous series are severely missed, making it intricate to establish a definite preference between the two. The music in this reboot is a satisfactory bungalow when up against the Empire State that was the score by Danny Elfman in the first two Spider-Man films, and Christopher Young in the third. No disrespect to James Horner whose contribution to 'The Amazing Spider-Man's' score is excellent, but with the will to compare, it's like a butter knife to a gun fight.I do not wish to bore those reading, as endless comparisons between the two and analysis of the stand alone film could provoke me to write a dissertation of needless proportions. Therefore, I will conclude by stating my comprehension of this review's bias, due to my obsession with the comic book hero, I almost refrained from observing its many imperfections. However, after watching it three times already I felt I have identified 'The Amazing Spider-Man' as a motion picture that had great potential to reboot an already successful film franchise. Was it necessary for Webb to reboot? Yes! I feel that he has introduced a new story for Peter Parker/Spider-Man that was not considered by Raimi. The execution may not have been perfect, yet this instalment does provide a great sense of well performed humour, action and emotion that perhaps is only existent due to the 50 year anniversary of Stan Lee's and Marvel's most successful character. This highly enjoyable reboot will hopefully instigate a more original story is subsequent sequels. 6/10 is perhaps too critical of Webb's work, yet the almost identical narrative to 2002 is this film's biggest downfall, as our villain in Dr. Curtis Connors/The Lizard acquires indistinguishable motives to that of Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin. It is Marvelous nonetheless, to see that the adored character Spider-Man has yet to spin his last Webb in cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A must watch,"When Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios announced in 2010 that they were rebooting the Spiderman series with a new cast and crew, critics as well as the fans were skeptical whether a revamp to the commercially successful trilogy would actually work. But as it turns out 'The Amazing Spider-man' has had the highest opening for a Hollywood film in India, even surpassing the other Marvel Studios movie, 'The Avengers'.So does the version of the Spiderman by Mark Webb match that of the director of the previous 3 movies by Sam Raimi? Yes it does, in fact better in certain cases.Andrew Garfield astonishes us by a refreshingly original approach to the character of The Spider-man. For starters, he doesn't play the shy, nerdish guy which was played by Tobey Maguire. It was Garfield's childhood dream to play the Spider-man, and it clearly shows in the movie where he effortlessly shows us a more intriguing, interesting version of the superhero.Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy, the love interest of Peter Parker and not Mary Jane, unlike in the previous movies. She does a decent job, and the love affair between them is more appealing and less annoying, which was the case between Maguire and Dunst. There is a very sizzling chemistry between Emma and Garfield, the real life couple look great together on-screen as well. The first half of the story is almost the same as the original Spider- man of 2002, with more emphasis being given on the story of how Peter got separated from his parents. Peter learns Oscorp Labs hired his dad's former associate, Dr. Curt Connors, whom Peter hopes has knowledge about his parents. But Connors (Rhys Ifans) is doing strange things with science, developing a reptile serum to regrow his missing arm, and one of his steroidal spiders bites Peter. Connors later turn into a giant lizard with voice and mind of a man. But however, he is not a terrifying villain as in case of the earlier movies. Also there are not many mind -numbing fight sequences in the movie, however the excellent graphics and CGI make up for it. Irrfan Khan is a let down, who speaks with a strange accent in the 2-3 minutes of his screen time.There are many funny scenes in the movie, like the one in which he falls on his knees and begs mercy from the thief, or the one in which he is lying upside down on the wall of his bedroom. The movie is a slight let down on the emotional front, as Raimi does a better job at handling the subject. All in all, the movie is definitely worth a watch. For all those who would rather download the movie on torrent and watch it, I would definitely suggest to have the theatrical experience of the movie. For all Marvel Comics fans, don't miss the cameo of Stan Lee, where he plays a librarian oblivious to the fight between Spider-Man and the Lizard happening behind him. And of course, typical of all Marvel movies, there is an after-credits scene, promising a sequel to the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Nothing to set it apart from the 2002 movie,"I give this movie a 6. Frankly I was hoping for something much better. I was hoping for something that would really make this movie different from the franchise started in 2002. Something that would really make it worth watching since it's only been 5 years since a Spiderman movie came out. Well you know what they say about wishes, and hopes don't you? You can hope in one hand and take a number 2 in the other hand, and see which one fills up first. Yeah, nothing new or great here.I guess you could say the story line is a tad different. They put Peter Parker's (Andrew Garfield) parents into the story. They also got rid of Mary Jane, in favor of a new love interest, Gwen (Emma Stone). They also remade Peter as a smart, loner, social outcast type (You know, like one of those kids that just might bring a gun to school), instead of just the nerdy geek with a camera.Everyone knows the rest of the story by now. A socially awkward boy that lives with his aunt and uncle, gets bit by genetically experimental spider which gives him incredible spider like abilities. His uncle gets killed and he decides to avenge his death, and become a vigilante super hero. In the end Peter has to choose between being a super hero and being with the girl he loves.I thought that maybe one reason they made this film so shortly after the last Toby Maguire trilogy (2002, 2004, 2007) might be to take a darker more sinister, and less corny version ala the Dark Knight franchise. While this one may have hinted that they wanted to go there in a few scenes it just never does. It still stays pretty corny. If you are going to make a film like this , Please have something original to offer and go for it. This movie to me looks and feels as though it was one of the last 3 films, but with different faces.Andrew Garfield really adds and brings nothing, and I would say that both him and Tobey Maguire did an equally poor job. Ditching Kirsten Dunst was a good move as she is one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood, and Emma Stone was probably the best actor in this whole movie so clearing out Mary Jane didn't hinder it. The CGI was overdone and that is one of the pet peeves I have with almost all movies these days.In the end this movie was completely unnecessary, especially when there was a trilogy put out just 5 years ago. Sounds to me like the studio just wanted to pull one over on us and make a quick buck. This movie looks and feels like everybody involved with the previous movies just threw it together with some out takes of the last ones, and there is nothing to distinguish it as anything any better or worse.I give it a 6, watchable, but it has nothing really different from the older 3 movies. If you want to watch a great, original, super hero movie, leave this one until you have exhausted all the others and rent Kick-Ass (2010) instead, and keep your eyes open for Kick-Ass 2 in June 2013.Like my reviews, Hate em?

The Amazing Spider-Man,"Before watching Spider-Man No Way Home (2021), I decided to re watch all the previous Spider-Man movies. However, I wanted to review all the Spider-Man movies until after I saw No Way Home so I could get a true rating. Every single Spider-Man movie was amazing, but this one was actually me least favorite. Don't get me wrong, I really liked this movie, it was entertaining, the actors were great and the villain was cool, but it just didn't stick out for me. That is why I feel the others are better.The main thing I really liked about this movie was how it showed the larger backstory or Peter Parker. In the Tobey Maguire films, we were told Peter's parents died, and he had to live with his aunt and uncle. In this movie, we were shown a little bit of what happened to his parents. It also showed them dropping Peter off at uncle Ben and aunt May's house and leaving. I really liked this because it was very unique, interesting, and added a very important aspect of Peter's story that was skipped over in the Sam Raimi movies.Another thing I liked about this moved was the acting and the story. I thought Emma Stone played Gwen Stacy perfectly, and her chemistry with Andrew is unbelievable. Also, the story of this movie was also pretty cool. I liked how Gwen found out Peter was Spider-Man very quickly. I also liked the family aspect added with the Stacy family.As you can see from my review. I really liked this movie. But in my opinion, the other Spider-Man's are just better. Still, I definitely recommend watching this. It is very well done, and important (just like the other movies) if you are going to see No Way Home.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Could have been better - If it knew what it wanted to be.,"Yet another disappointing superhero ""blockbuster"". I don't think this film can quite work out what it wanted to be. At times there were elements of a darker more serious tone which worked well. But then these moments were spoiled with the usual fast camera editing style of the action scenes which at some points you could not work out what was going on (though I suppose if your of the Call of Duty & Transformers generation this will be appealing to you). Absolutely nothing new or interesting in the terms of plot , the same old good guy who accidentally turns himself bad and ends in a CGI city fight like almost all these Superhero action films endings. Convenient and predictable scenes (the crane scene at the end is just laughable). Good points - I like the new Spiderman, he really captures the ""Smart Ass"" style Spiderman well and is a lot better than the Emo-Spiderman the other one was.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Sterile,"When this reboot came out it felt too close to the most recent series of films and generally it looked uninspired so I gave it a skip but the upcoming release of the sequel made me think that maybe it was worth me checking out. In terms of the plot the majority will be familiar to most people since it is not only a famous character but we only really had this same plot a few years ago. The second half of the film has a different villain than the previous film but really it will all feel like very familiar territory – and this is just one of the problems that the film never totally overcomes.The feeling that the whole film is unnecessary is one that never goes away; it feels superficial and hollow from the very start and even the introductory origin material doesn't scan – it is unconvincing and illogical and this continues all the way to the bite. From here the development into Spiderman is not particularly well done, with a comic tone that isn't warranted or supported by the material. The focus on Peter and Gwen Stacey offers potential but it doesn't come through because it also feels overly superficial and keen to be where it wants to be without actually doing any work to get there on its own. This continues for the remainder of the film as it never really has any heart or any sense of real danger or thrill.The effects do cover for it and there is a natural flow and movement to the characters who are wholly CGI but to be honest, without any real reason to care about what was going on, all I could think was how little you could get these days for over USD200MM. There isn't any grit to it although the bigger surprise to me was that it really wasn't a lot of fun either. Okay we get the wise-cracking Spiderman of old, but it isn't particularly funny and there isn't any wonder, mischief or fun to the character or the action. The performances are fine but mostly wasted because the material isn't there for them; Garfield is fine but Stone doesn't convince and just feels overly flirty. Ifans fails to bring out the tragedy of his character in the way some of those in the previous series managed.Generally this film never stops feeling unnecessary. The story is overly familiar and this telling is uninspiring and uninspired; it has the money on the screen in terms of the effects but otherwise it is disappointingly hollow and Corporate, with no edge, no fun, no spark and no real reason for it to really exist beyond the profitability of the character. I was genuinely surprised by how totally sterile the entire film was.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Amazing Spiderman Delivers,"The Amazing Spider Man tells the story of Peter Parker a young teenager in high school who one day gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider, he undergoes changes from this.The Amazing Spider Man is one of those films where I wasn't looking forward to it at first because it was a reboot, and usually with reboots they end up being bad. When I saw the teaser for the film last year, I thought it made Spider Man look like it was going to be dark and gritty, like The Dark Knight was but this was not the case with the actual film. The Amazing Spider Man may be darker then the original Rami films, but it also has plenty of jokes in it to balance it out.I think why The Amazing Spider Man mainly works for is because the story draws you in, sure its a bit of a generic story but then again so are most other movies of this genre. The film tells the story of Peter Parker and what happens to him when he gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider and how the changes affect him, it also focuses on the relationships that Peter has with his Aunt and uncle, Gwen Stacy and her father, and Dr. Connors. This is why I think the movie focuses on so many levels, it focuses on the story first and then the action later, its about the relationships in Peter's life its about the changes Peter faces and how they affect his life.The Amazing Spider Man also delivers on the action and not once during the film does the action get confusing. The only downfall for the movie is that there isn't to many action scenes, while this isn't a bad thing I still would have to liked to see a few more scenes between The Lizard and Spider Man.All of the actors in the movie delivers solid performances but for me the breakout performance in the movie would have to be Andrew Garfield as Spider Man, if there was one thing the movie had going for it, it would be Garfield. Ever since I saw Garfield in The Social Network I've been a big fan of his, I think Garfield was the perfect choice to portray both Peter Parker and Spiderman because he fits the role so perfectly and delivers a great performance that stands out in the movie, I think Garfield should win an award for his performance. Emma Stone also delivered a strong performance as Gwen Stacy, she made you believe that a girl like her would fall for a nerd like Peter Parker, Emma Stone makes you believe in the relationship that her and Peter has. I would also like to point out that Rhys Ifans delivers a solid performance as Dr. Connors and The Lizard, he makes you feel for the character even though The Lizard is your typical Villain.The Amazing Spider Man is the best Spider Man film yet, it delivers on everything you would expect from a Spider Man movie and make sure to stay during the end credits as there's a scene mid way through.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Webb's webs are artificial, yet are they more real?","The looming question many people should have when entering The Amazing Spider-Man is was it justified to reboot a series that's original film turns ten this very year? Entering the film and hearing about it throughout the course of the past two years, I thought the idea was undeniably foolish. A reboot's purpose, in my eyes, is to introduce a character audiences have likely forgotten about, or have not been properly acquainted with. The recent Captain America film was justified by two reasons; the upcoming Avengers film and the fact that audiences are likely not wholly familiar with his story.Today, even after seeing The Amazing Spider-Man, I believe the idea of starting a whole new series is a foolish idea with only money in mind. I fear that this review will quickly turn into a list, as I am planning to compare/contrast this with Raimi's original Spider-Man film, a rarely credited, well done superhero film.As far the story goes, the idea hasn't changed too much, but the Green Goblin has been traded for ""The Lizard"" and the love interest is no longer Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane but Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy. The origin-story of Peter Parker hasn't changed much either. After going to a genetics laboratory, sneaking in for that matter, he is bitten on the neck by a spider and starts to encounter strange symptoms, beginning with catlike reflexes and, finally, with sticky hands and the ability to leap and jump higher than imaginable.After Parker's uncle is shot and killed (played by Martin Sheen in a very convincing role), he decides to use his powers for defending New York City from crime and scum. On the side, he frequently visits Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), an Oscorp scientist who worked with Parker's dad for numerous years. Connors has ambition to create a regeneration serum to give him his right arm back, but when something goes horribly wrong, he becomes ""The Lizard,"" an evil, menacing creature, who serves as the story's main villain.Parker, played by Andrew Garfield, is still his geeky self, but it has been reduced quite a bit from Raimi's effort. The original Spider-Man had Peter Parker tripping on his own shoelaces. Here, Garfield makes the character noticeably an outcast, but doesn't hammer in the idea that the character is rather soft. When it comes down to Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield, while both actors never cease to impress me with their choice of roles or on-screen presence, I was still more sold on Maguire, who had the role down to a tune. Garfield is a very talented actor, and I think he has many things here to rebound off of, such as Emma Stone's memorable charisma and personality, yet I feel he provides almost too much confidence to a character who is supposed to be rather unassuming. The comic book character was easily identifiable if you were an outcast, but Garfield gives his role to much of a hybrid-appearance.As far as confidence goes, the film has quite a lot of it. It is stylishly put together, memorably crafted, and very, very dark. The original film incorporated many primary colors and flashy action sequences to remind us of the panels of a comic book. Director Mark Webb makes this an inevitably more stylistic piece, by adding more darkness to the picture and to the story of Parker himself. He projects the character's struggle and agony in a believable way, and this was something Raimi's installment neglected. Some scenes of battle and peril go on for too long here, but one scene, on a bridge during one of the first main Lizard fight scenes, is incredibly moving and touching.There are times when Webb's direction and the screenplay, written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves, is pleasantly patient, yet there are times when it's rushed and impatient. Part of the problem is there is so much to handle when making a ""Spider-Man"" film. Even Raimi's original had some trouble with pacing. The problem is you're trying to breathlessly juggle an immense amount of truly meaningful characters, subplots, and instances that some of them go a tad underdeveloped. Take for example the love story between Peter and Gwen, a welcomed addition to the story. Although the romance is sweet and good-natured, the love story involving Peter and Mary Jane played much better, mainly because of the sincere and open discussions they had along the way. There is so much going on with this film that the love story seems rather traditional at times. Not to mention, it is noticeable that the story of Dr. Connors was somewhat undermined to incorporate more scenes of action and romance.I stand by my views when it comes to The Amazing Spider-Man's purpose of existence, which is slim and rather unnecessary. The story is all too familiar, and will be for the next few decades seeing as we now have two franchises, one in its early stages, about the same character with relatively the same line of events. Raimi's film was the first feature film about the character, and after twenty-five years in development hell, it was refreshing and welcoming to be shown a hero of such depth and charm. While I say this, I can recognize that the film is aesthetically pleasing, visually enjoyable, and acted with gratitude and satisfaction. I too admire Marc Webb's direction, which in just a matter of three years went from sentimental indie romance to lightning fast blockbuster.Starring: Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Campbell Scott, Irrfan Khan, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, and Chris Zylka. Directed by: Marc Webb.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

But this one is the new Kid on the block. Rash, aggressive, confused, and in the making of a hero. The shades of emotions reflected in Riley's spideeman is really amiss. In essence, there are just stills.There have been few changes in the plot as Emma Watson gives way to Gwen. The sweetness with Aunt May has reduced. Spiderman is always visualized with Aunt May giving some lines which are very important to the whole character of Spiderman and Parker.

Saved by the Third-Act Inspiring Hope that #2 Will Be Better,"If this rather quick return of the Web-Slinger has any reason to exist, it may be to just keep the Character (Marvel's Most Popular and Fan-Favorite) alive in the ever-growing Universe of Comic-Book Characters on the big screen.But, one could say that familiarity breeds contempt. For example, by now just like Superman and Batman, anyone with a heartbeat knows the Origin Story and watching it played out again with Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) with Aunt May (Sally Field) is a Ho-Hum experience.That's not exactly what is expected when an over 200 Million Dollar Budgeted Super-Hero Movie is unleashed on the Fans and the Public that eats this stuff up like there will never be another one.But after the Origin Story is over, it settles into its Teen-Angst template. Here again, we get to see Peter Parker, previously bullied by His High School Classmate ""Flash"". The ""Revenge"" that the now Peter (Spider-Man) Parker can unleash is a lame basketball court duel that is Boring and lackluster.Things pick up after the requisite and awkward Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) verbal courting where They see who can stutter and stammer the most. Peter does a lot of stammering throughout the Film and it gets a bit tiring.The Movie is at its best with the Lizard Man in the Third Act that saves the Film from an utter and dismal failure. In fact, the final third of the thing when Spider-Man is on the street catching criminals and ultimately confronting The Lizard is good enough to make this darker and more serious Spidey follow up better than a disappointment and leaves hope that Amazing #2 will be much better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Workman like, mild thrills - uneven direction; overall lacking in purpose.","Why did we need a Spiderman reboot when there are so many other ideas that could have been brought to life with the same budget, cast and direction?The singular answer is that the studio sees this and every other huge budget comic book extravaganza as an investment. A huge one. When you're monkeying around with an investment on this scale, you're conservative: You make just enough semi-relevant changes to justify the films existence.That just doesn't cut it though for such an iconic character. You must either accept or reject the notion that, in the end, all you will be receiving with this title is a slightly different take on the same old story. Don't walk into the theater expecting reinvention of the wheel.If you can completely embrace the notion that you will be force fed the same formulaic origins story from start to finish with pin point precision in playing identical emotional notes to its forbearer - you won't be severely disappointed. There just isn't a rational reason to have to lower your expectation, though.The primary reason I find this Spiderman unacceptable isn't that the character is boring. It isn't that the actors are bad - they aren't. Garfield is a particularly good Spiderman; better than Maguire.The main reason this film is unacceptable is that the bar has moved drastically. Hardcore comic book fans are packing the theaters with higher expectations than ever; the genre has evolved so to speak. With titles like X-Men first Class, The Avengers and The Dark Knight films in the same universe - this Spidey simply doesn't have the same impact as the ten years old predecessor.In this new, evolved universe fans are more savvy. We now expect the thrill rating to ratchet up higher; the contours to be more dynamic. We expect to see ensembles; teams and entire casts of superhero's working together in the same universe ... the Marvel movie universe. We expect a degree of suspense. This film has no suspense- of course not; not when we've seen it already before it begins.What we have here is something that might have been great 10 years ago. It's not great now; it's profoundly average in the context of the other comic book films surrounding it.If it's at all legally possible, I would sincerely hope that Spiderman exist (in a clearly defined and visible way) within the Marvel Universe that has so rapidly expanded ... leaving the web slinger in his own niche only makes him that much more insignificant.My hope is that somehow Spidey can be incorporated into the Marvel Universe in much the same way the Avengers worked; or in much the same way X-Men first class worked. Adding some comic book buddies will take some of the weight off of Garfield's shoulders ... he's a good Spiderman but I don't feel he can carry the load alone.Until then, it's the same old story - and your friendly neighborhood Spiderman is awfully lonely relying on the same old schtick.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Spider man Ever,"I was a huge fan of the first two spider-man films not so much the third. The amazing spider man is better than the sam rami spider-man films period. The action in this movie is sparse but it is 100 times better than the action in the sam rami movies. Spider man actually used his acrobatics and web to fight the lizard, not go blow for blow like he was superman fighting dark seid. I've seen people say the movie went too fast at some points like when he made his costume choice. Toby magurie did three sketches and appeared in a amazingly made costume, what did he use to make that?????

Marc Webb looked to be more concerned with representing Spider Man's earthly features rather than the script,"If I count the 3D effects of this film, it can achieve a big Okay. But as a movie compared to previous Spider Man films, I have to assert it as the worst of this Marvel's spider version. Marc Webb looked to be more concerned with representing Spider Man's earthly features rather than the script. Though he pulled some major changes in the story of earlier productions such as casting Stacy instead of Mary Jane, bringing the Lizard in antagonist role; still Webb, seemingly, paid his most concentration to make Spider Man more humanistic following Nolan's philanthropy in Batman series. I couldn't be satisfied with the maladroit over-acting of Andrew Garfield as before. Irfan Khan's short appearance and departure came as vague. But Emma Stone's acting was emancipated from these glitches despite having just a commercial heroine role. The way Parker turned him with the suit was quick and quirky. Overall, this so-so super hero movie could not reach my high expectancy____7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Twilight with Spiders,"Not good not bad. Thankfully I went into this knowing that it will be different from Raimi's Spider-Man. There are things I liked about Raimi's version and Marc Webb's version.Here's what I liked and didn't like about both movies - 1) I still like the idea that Spidey's web-shooting ability being a genetic mutation rather than coming from a device. 2) Maguire was suitably geeky and nerdy as Peter Parker. 3) Garfield's Peter Parker was too cocksure to be convincing that he'd ever be bullied at school, have trouble making friends or get the girls. Also his version of Spider-Man was too cocky. 4) Raimi's style meant the movie had a horror comedy feel which made it stand out from the other polished and shiny superhero movies. 5) Although typical of most superheroes, Raimi's Parker's desire to keep his identity a secret to protect his loved ones makes the character richer and easier to root for. Whilst Webb's Parker seems to be a lot more immature and reckless with his powers; like a teenager who seems disinterested in anything else except getting the girl. 6) Uncle Ben - I prefer Martin Sheen's Uncle Ben way more than Cliff Robertson's. 7) Aunt May - Sally Field's Aunt May doesn't seem to have much more to do than pout around the house waiting for Peter to come home. However, I'm not sure if I prefer this or Rosemary Harris' naggy version. 8) Raimi's montage of Peter's realisation, acceptance and transformation into Spider-Man was more fun to watch and more structured; it showed the process. Whereas Webb's montage was more like a Nike commercial or music video. 9) The pace of Webb's movie was a little uneven, it just jumped from one set-piece to another before the previous one has finished. 10) In Webb's Spider-Man, I do appreciate the implications of Peter's mysterious family history and shadowy parents, which wasn't even hinted at in Raimi's, but ultimately it didn't really have any real impact on the story, unlike the background of the Hulk for example.All in all, The Amazing Spider-Man feels rather unnecessary and excessive just now, since Raimi's Spider-Man movies are still fresh in the public consciousness. Also, it feels too much like Twilight with superheroes/supervillains. I'm leaning more towards Raimi's Spider-Man as the more superior movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Too similar, too light.","I had feared a not true to comic book storyline. What I got was a slow and borderline boring first half with the same story being retold with minute changes. Even the origin story of the antagonist is too similar to the Green Goblin storyline --> pressure of success and personal demons lead to a good guy taking risks of the bio-chemical kind and turning evil.While the action sequences are good and the 3d is great, the storyline and the screenplay is (for the lack of a better word) extremely 'teenybopper' in nature. I know that the characters are teenagers, but at times I felt like the scene was out of gossip girl.What I did like were the actors. Garfield was OK, but Stone, Sheen, Fields, Leary and Ifans are immensely likable and did a good job.The light tone of the movie and the treatment ensure that it will have a an extremely wide reach. The audience was primarily made up of families in the theater where I saw the movie. This wide reach will lead to this movie making a lot of money, and it may even do better than Avengers and TDK but is not even close to being in the same league.I hope that the minor changes in the origination plot will lead to a better sequel (there will be one) that is grittier and darker and tells us a new story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Review,"Every fan of Spider-Man, Andrew Garfield, Marc Webb should go and see the movie.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" when you see it as a reboot of a previous Spider-Man film franchise which was a hit, everyone expects more from this movie.Marc Webb has done a great job in retelling the story of Peter Parker but has not done a great job in using the 3D effects to its fullest. Andrew Garfield has done an amazing job as an actor in the movie. He is in many ways a more convincing Peter Parker/Spider-Man than Toby Maguire. But has not been able bring the innocence of Peter Parker to the big screen as was done by Toby Maguire.Marc Webb could have made it a better movie had he emphasized more scenes of Peter Parker realizing his responsibility as Spider-Man,New York city's opinion about Spider-Man's action as a vigilante,more 3D effects.Chemistry between Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield is excellently portrayed.It is a good movie to watch but cannot be compared to previous Spider-Man franchise in terms of direction.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Sony made this movie just to keep Spider-Man rights!,"Ok so the title might confuse some people so let me explain what it mean to everyone.When Sony bought the Spider-Man rights from Marvel back in late 90's there's an agreement between Sony & Marvel that Sony has to make at least 1 Spider-Man film in every 5 years to keep the rights to themselves otherwise it'll get back to the Marvel.So to just keep the rights sony made this movie otherwise they had no interest in making another Spider-Man movie after knowing that Spider-Man 4 was got cancelled. Sony just don't know how to handle Spider-Man's character & how to make good films. You might say they gave us raimi trilogy but it happened because of Sam Raimi and not because of Sony, the idea of adding Venom in Spider-Man 3 was of Sony's and raimi didn't wanted to include Venom in the third movie but Sony forced raimi to add so he had to.So the movie itself was a reboot and not a continuation to the Spider-Man 3 and it turned out pretty mediocre. The good things in this movie was amazing CGi (tbh this is the only area where the word 'Amazing' can get used lol) the action & flying sequences were all amazing and very cool to look at. But the rest of the movie was pretty mediocre like at first they show how peter gets bullied in the high school then there's gwen stacy this time instead of MJ and she sympathises with peter then they get in love with eachother then there's this lizard professor who has shown as a villain which is pretty bland tbh like it's hulk but he transforms into lizard lmao
Overall Sony didn't really tried anything to make it a good movie imo it's just that they wanted to keep rights so they released this movie as a reboot and yeah it's pretty mediocre movie and there's nothing that much to talk about.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great movie, but was there really any need for a remake?","If you love, or even just like Spider-Man, and enjoy action, TASM will give you your money's worth. My only quibble is that Andrew Garfield is no Tobey Maguire, and Emma Stone is no Kirsten Dunst. They're a bit shallow in an otherwise entertaining film. But did this really need to be remade, or was this merely a substitute for the abandoned Spider-Man 4? I would have liked to have seen another sequel, but then again, a sequel would have been the same story anyway, so it wouldn't have made any difference. Even though I enjoyed watching the evil lizard, which is put to good use, it's nothing special. Since Peter Parker's aunt and uncle are secondary to the plot, they really aren't necessary (Sally Field's just here for the money) After all, the movie is about Spider-Man himself (and versus the villain), and mostly his love interest, but not his family.*** out of ****",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great movie,"On top of this review there's a seven, but the truth is, I don't have a specific rate for this movie, I just think that The Amazing Spiderman is a great movie. From all the blockbuster's that we will have this year, The Amazing Spiderman will be distinguished from all of them by its humor, performances, actor chemistry, entertainment, heart, and of course, by being a spiderman movie.Before I see it, it took me a little time to want to go see it, cause, I've seen all the previous spiderman movies and when I saw this movie's trailer with Garfield instead of Maguire, I thought to myself, that The Amazing Spiderman was just a stupid remake that I wouldn't to go see. Later, when I was invited to go to the movies, The Amazing Spiderman was an option of the viewing, I saw the new trailers, I read the reviews and it actually got me thinking that I should give it a shot.I left the theater with a big smile on my face. The Amazing Spiderman is not an untold story, it's very similar to Sam's Spiderman, but it has many good qualities that I did not see in the original Spiderman. First of all, Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) fits better in the suit than Maguire, I admired his performance as the Peter Parker and Emma Stone, who you'd think that plays Mary Jane, actually plays Gwen Stacy, and her performance was also amazing, but I really admired was Garfield and Stone's tremendous chemistry, which was the back bone/heart/soul of the movie. Overall, The Amazing Spiderman wouldn't be the same with these two love birds in the film.So, my thoughts are: The Amazing Spiderman convinces in the performances and in the amazing CGI effects. The action scenes weren't amazing at the ending but we can still get from a superhero what's most important, a well-told story, good performances by the cast and heroic scenes, and this movie had all of that.

Kind of OK,"Well, I was hoping for more, but was not nearly as entertained as I hoped I would be. The storyline was OK-ish, but I felt is was a touch too simplistic. I am not aware of the comic book history of Spiderman, it never appealed tome as a child, but surely, Spiderman would keep his identity hidden from everyone. In this movie, the Spiderman character seemed to spend most of the movie with his real identity exposed for all to see..

Better than expected,"Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is a shy loner with a crush on Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Then one day he is bitten by a mutant spider. Spider-Man is born.Surprisingly good. I liked the Tobey Maguire series and felt that a reboot wasn't necessary. However, this reboot doesn't feel like it is covering old ground, and feels fresh, original and energetic. Interesting from start to finish.Another surprise was the performance of Andrew Garfield. I had massive doubts about his ability to star in an action movie, but he pulls this off well. No doubts about Emma Stone - always good. Great all-star supporting cast: Martin Sheen, Sally Field, Denis Leary, Rhys Ifans.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The A-meh-zing Spiderman,"First, let me just say that I liked the Raimi trilogy...yes, even Spiderman 3 was fairly good. Did it have some problems, oh yes, but mostly enjoyable.Anyway, when it was announced that Spidey was getting a reboot I, like many other people, thought why? Why is it necessary to throw out everything just because you're changing lead actors and director. Could've just stuck with the Peter and MJ relationship but with different actors and kept the current film continuity. Sure it would've raised some eyebrows but there would've been far less uproar than a complete retelling of the story.Where was I? Oh yes, this new Spiderman movie. While it's not terrible, it's FAR from great. It just has not heart to it, no drive. Everything in this story is so by-the-numbers that you can see every plot turn a mile away. That would be fine, even somewhat forgivable, if this movie was fun but that's not the case.Nearly every actor in this film seems miscast. From the generic guy playing Flash to Sally Field, right up to Andrew Garfield as the man in tights himself. No one seems to have a real handle on the character they're playing so they resort to archtypes. Emma Stone, as a prime example, slips into the same well worn shoes of the character she seems to play, with minor variations, in every movie: sardonic girl who wears her inner girl power on her sleeve. A little of that goes a long way.The effects in this movie were mildly disappointing for a big summer blockbuster especially Spiderman's web swinging and the Lizard. One of the ""improvements"" for this reboot has been the use of as much live action web swinging for Spiderman as possible, to make it look more life like. They must have realized early on that this was not the way to go because most of Spidey's web swinging is done at night, which I'm assuming is to hide the ridiculousness of a man swinging around in a harness.Then there is the Lizard. What a visual train wreck of a villain he is. With all the money that Sony sank into this ""reboot"" there wasn't enough to hire a better CGI effects team? The Lizard looks like he's straight from one of the Syfy Channel's ""Dinocrock vs Jurassic Lizard"" B grade films. OK, maybe not THAT bad but certainly not at the level one would expect from a film like this.This is getting long so I'm going to sum up my remaining criticisms of this film: 1) Everyone in New York knows that Peter Parker is Spiderman!!! I lost count of how many times he gave himself away, either by taking off his mask or displaying his superhuman abilities while in his street clothes.2) Guess when you're a parent of a future superhero, or the girl he likes, your life is pretty much over. Peter's parents vanish, Uncle Ben dies, Gwen's father dies...good lord! You're next May Parker.3) Sally Field and Martin Sheen were not believable as a couple. If it wasn't for the fact that they're named Uncle Ben and May Parker, I never would've believed they were married.Whew, there I've said my piece...now I'm going home.

"it's like a family's generations, deteriorating gradually","this is a horrible movie with very bad and boring screenplay, bad directing, bad sound track (background sound/music), and most of all, the worst casting job! the young actor who played the spiderman was a a terrible choice done by a lousy casting agency. this young actor got a very unlikable face and a low i.q. expression, his mouth is always half opened and i just couldn't find anything special of his acting. he's not energetic enough to be a spiderman, looked quite immature and spiritless, even when he's not a spiderman but a nerd like person, i just couldn't place him to play the spiderman role. this is a very boring film with horrible scenario, storyline and plot. the whole movie was just so predictable and at the same time, most of the scenes were nighttime dark. the supporting female actor was not too good either. she looked like about 10 years older than the little brother kiddy spiderman. this is a movie that making the summertime feel more bored than ever. save your money and time and go to magic mountain fun park to have some thrills.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It was... all right.,"I normally only review movies with friends. I have never gone online and posted my opinion about a movie so this review for me is a first. So let me start this review off by saying I'm not a comic book fan or superhero fan in the first place. The Avengers was ""Meh"" for me while it was ""Wahoo!"" for others. I walked into the movie theatre not knowing what to expect. My thoughts were ""Why are they redoing Spider-Man and why is there no Toby Maguire?"". I guess I don't watch enough previews or trailers. I basically pre-rated it and judged it thinking it was going to be a complete waste of time and money.Fast forwarding now... So I watch the movie and I was very surprised and impressed with what I just watched. The beginning was fast and the whole hide and go seek thing was extremely confusing. A good movie can establish characters within the first 10-20 minutes of the movie, and I felt like this process was dragging on and on and on. I was laughing at how dumb the movie was until about half way through the movie where that laughter turned into laughter having nothing to do with a flaw. So finally things began to pick up and I actually started enjoying the movie. The acting was so-so. Mostly the one liner actors were the ones I had issues with, but other than that the acting was pretty convincing. I was impressed and I didn't feel like I was watching an overrated superhero movie(though it did have many superhero movie clichés).I'm not a movie reviewer and I have a tendency to ramble, so here's how I basically feel about the movie. Dragged on in the beginning but eventually it became watchable once Spider-Man starts kicking butt. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes action, with some subtle humor and a little bit of romance. I do not, however, recommend IMAX 3D. 3D didn't do too much to the visuals so just see it in the regular theatre and maybe you can use the extra $7 to buy yourself one overpriced soda. The Amazing Spiderman, it's watchable, but you will notice flaws that ruin the mood at times. Also... make sure you're with friends(but really... who goes to a movie alone?O_o). Friends always make movies a lot more entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not so Amazing,"When the first trilogy of Spiderman had come out, I was impressed by the acting, visuals, and story. This new rehash of Spiderman did not leave me with the same impression. When I saw the trailer, I was not impressed in any way. The only reason that made me pay to watch this film was because of Emma Stone, who played Gwen Stacy.Before I go on, let me begin with the pro's: - Good Acting. Emma Stone always amazes me because she brings a new character to every movie she picks.Fantastic Visual Effects. First Person style swinging and the slow-motion parkour scenes were entertaining to watch.At this point I would give this film a 4/10 The Cons of this film unfortunately don't build that score muchThe soundtrack was no where as ""amazing"" as the original Spiderman movie soundtrack. Spiderman is an amazing superhero and his theme should reflect him.Poor story telling: Slow and boring is how this film progresses. I did not feel as if I got to know all the characters in the film and it seemed as if most characters besides Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy were bland and missing something.Tobey Maguire's performance in the original is more believable than Andrew Garfield's in this rehash, although I must say Andrew did a pretty good job. Unfortunately, the script was nothing special.Although this film portrays Spiderman as he was in the comic books in some ways, this movie did not impress me as much as the other trilogy did.Acting - 2/3 Visuals - 2/2 Soundtrack - 1/2 Story - 1/3Overall - 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Oh, what a tangled web we weave","Based on The Marvel Comic Book by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, it was appropriately directed by Mark Webb.Usually but not always the remakes lack originality and the following of the first. Well, this version very much surpassed any previous versions, and the character of Peter Parker (Spidie) is better rounded, and his background made the character is better told. The whole story seems better-rounded and consistent with the magazine.I appreciate the mix of actors, some well-known to many others well-known to followers. Each made their character come alive.I do not want to go into too much detail as the fun is anticipating the events. Some of us do not need to compare not seeing any original movies or magazines. So, it is well worth a look.There are several DVDs and download combinations of this presentation. If you have the opportunity to watch the extras they only add to the experience of the movie.

The untold story begins...again...,"When I walked out of the theatre after seeing this movie, I saw the poster for it, which had the tagline ""The untold story begins""...to which the appropriate response is: ""Again?"". In another ten years they could again have another origin story for Spider-Man and use the same tagline again.I'm not that familiar with Spiderman lore, but I did read recently that this origin story is more in keeping with one of the comic book iterations of this story...perhaps the first comic book series? So, basically, it's a tweaking of the Tobey Maguire incarnation as the hero. Someone on the internet did call me an idiot many years ago for saying that I saw a Spiderman movie in the cinema where the hero, Peter Parker, gained his powers by a bite from a radioactive spider. That person just didn't believe that I saw this. In any case, genetic engineering is more 'current' in our society, so bites from radioactive spiders is out.Can't say that I remember, but I probably liked Tobey Maguire's turn as Spider-Man better. Perhaps if I'd seen this current version first, the situation would be reversed. In any case, Andrew Garfield is very good in the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man...but he did strike me as having a very Tobey Maguire type of vibe to his performance. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is also good in her role as Peter Parker's love interest. And, again, she is very reminiscent of Kirsten Dunst in her role as another love interest for Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man (a different character though...hence why this origin story is slightly different to Tobey Maguire's version). One annoying thing about this movie is the piling on of coincidence after coincidence as far as how some characters keep popping up in places where they are likely to meet Peter Parker...or indeed for having a relationship to people Peter Parker/Spider-Man has 'conflict' with.My biggest bugbear is the ancient cliché of the superhero displaying extraordinary powers in a sporting context. I'm Australian, so basketball or gridiron holds no interest for me. So, it's just so face-palming to see Peter Parker excel in those sports. No doubt it's aimed at the younger demographic for this movie...providing the lesson that yes, boys, you too can become an athletic superstar...with a little help from superpowers...and genetic engineering...and anabolic steroids too? This awful cliché reached its nadir in ""Bionic showdown"" where an American human/machine hybrid won a gold medal at the Olympics...yuh...no cheating there, sir!The end of this movie does have a narrative hook to keep you watching sequels but I'm not sure that that will be enough to make me fork out to see it. Denis Leary as a prominent policeman in this movie was good for laughs and would have been a welcome return for any sequel.A solid movie but the similarities to the Tobey Maguire incarnation are too fresh for me to get that much out of the movie...not sure, but I may have bailed on the Maguire franchise after the first sequel...these kinds of movies tend to peter out, interest wise, pretty quickly. For those new to the franchise, it's a likable origin story with some good casting and acting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not the best but not the worst.,"Andrew Garfield is likable as Peter Parker. He has a great performance and his chemistry with Emma Stone is undeniable. Is he a comic accurate Peter Parker? In some aspects yes, in others no. He is still a science whiz and is more or less your ""everyman"" archetype, but gone is the geeky nerd seen in the early comics. This Peter Parker is cool, but still gives off the loner attitude that character needs. I think it works really well, but I understand why some people wouldn't be entirely on board with it.The Lizard plot in this movie was very obviously cut down, and is pretty lacking in general character development. There are a few key scenes that were cut from the movie which make for really compelling character moments, and I have to say the movie is a lot worse off without them. Overall I thought the main story was pretty solid, though.I wouldn't recommend this as an introduction to Spider-Man, but as a fun superhero action movie it's more than solid and is a lot of fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, not great.","The Amazing Spider-Man is definitely the best Spider-man movie thus far. The casting and acting is much much better in this one than the others.

The story is better than the original and is intense in places.However, this movie has nothing out of the ordinary at all. Pretty much everything in the film can be expected. I walked into this film expecting a great film, but I got a good one. The story line and plot devices are very ordinary and nothing unexpected from the audience.

Unbelievable disappointment,Being an ardent fan of Spiderman series I awaited eagerly for this movie and I was totally disappointed with the Story .The Story was heavily Modified from Scratch. First They have changed the story on lot places and even Spidey's Character . I would not mind the story but the real spider-man was a real nerd and did not just google around for things! he understood neo-genics very well and did not just steal his fathers formula and write it down for Dr. Curt Conners.Secondly Spidey doesnot go around revealing secrets of his pals to some Cops who don't even trust him. Dr. Curt conners was a great person who at least in Human form wished to retain a normal life.Third the Action sequences were utter crap compared to the previous Movies. Spidey gets shot multiple times I mean Where the hell was his Spider sense in such situations .Finally It would have been great if they had focused on how he built that Web shooting device of his and how his suit was supposed to be a excellent armor.I hated a lot of things like the Stupid Romance scenes that ate up most of the time that could be used for good action sequences !,3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
best spider man yet,I haven't seen much of the new guy playing spider man and i wasn't really interested in watching the movie because i didn't like the super hero movies even the dark knights i didn't care for. i liked Thor though. what got me into this movie was Emma stone and then well sally fields as spider mans aunt. i like the fact that in this movie spiderman Andrew Garfield is more easily believable as a high school going to college kid not a man and to me Emma stone is also more believable at that age than Kirsten durst. i also like how this spiderman had a more playful side. the other sideman's he was more nerdy and poor and his aunt/uncle seemed more like his great grandparents. i would have liked to see doctor Connors struggling more to control his monster side like he did in the cartoon not relishing it. in this movie Connors seemed like he loved being the alligator and i was under the impression that he hated it and was like no no not again i gotta control this instead of this lizard DNA gives me power rarr I'm going to rampage. thats not the Connors i know. the Connors i know would try to resist his lizard urges. but anything with Emma stone is gold and i mean boner gold,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Worth a look?...,"I found it quite hard to look at this film without drawing parallels with Sam Raimi's 2002 film Spider-Man. The two are very similar in many ways although this one did try to stay a little more grounded. As far as performances go, well everyone did a decent job; Andrew Garfield coped well with the dual role of Spider-Man and Peter Parker and Emma Stone did a decent job as Gwen Stacey. I thought Rhys Ifans did a very decent job as The Lizard/Dr. Curt Connors and Denis Leary was fine as the cop Captain Stacey (Gwen's dad). But I must give a special mention for Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben and Sally Field as Aunt May; a masterful piece of casting; both were perfect (IMO).Comparing the two films (it's hard not to), I felt that this one didn't really add anything that the original did. Yes, it's a slightly different take on it, but essentially the same. There are long periods spent setting up dramatic plot points that don't always pay off and I also felt it was far too long. The CGI is all very well done and the fight sequences are also well executed but I did have the nagging feeling I had seen it all before. Don't get me wrong, it's a good film, but (IMO) not different enough from Sam Raimi's effort to be a great film. Even so Recommended, especially if you haven't seen the original 2002 movie.My score: 6.8/10IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 29,271 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 66/100: (Based on 42 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 72/100 (based on 228 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 84/100 'Liked it' (based on 291,053 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The amazing Spider-Man,"Being a Spider-man comic book fan I can say that a lot of the stuff that happens in this story is true to the comic book Spider-man. Spider-man has web shooters, Spider-man likes to joke a lot, Gwen Stacy was Spider-man's first love, etc. So Anyone who is a fan of the comics will respect this movie on that merit, the merit that it was faithful to the source material while bringing in new stuff without losing what made Spider-man who he is.People who've only seen the Spider-man films and never bothered to read any of the comics. Won't like this film as much. They'll say the same old stuff. ""Why was this made? We've seen this already?"" Blah blah blah.Let me go off saying that behind Spider-man 2, this is probably the best of the Spider-man trilogy for one reason.....it avoids all clichés that the original trilogy didn't. In fact the film pretty much avoids all clichés at all. I'll try and explain a few without spoiling the film.Well first of all the woman in this film aren't morons. One of the main problems I had with Sam Raimi's films was the fact that all woman were pretty much portrayed as objects that Spider-man can save. None of them do anything helpful. Sure Mary Jane tried to hit Doctor Octopus with a plank in the second film, but she couldn't even do that right. That's not the case here. Gwen actually has a confrontation with with villain and she doesn't screw around, I won't say what she does but when I saw it happen I couldn't help but cheer. Finally a Spider-man film where the woman have a brain-stem.The second cliché it avoids is being predictable. The original films basically have Spider-man going through the motions. Girl gets kidnapped, Spidey saves girl, Spidey defeats villain or jumps out of the way so the villain can do harm to himself. That is not the case with this film, a lot of the time you think one thing is going to happen but then it doesn't and the opposite happens.The third cliché it avoids is having silly moments. The first trilogy had a lot of them, yes even Spider-man 2 (The raindrops keep falling on my head scene). Going back an having re-watched the Sam Raimi trilogy before seeing this one, the films are more like popcorn films. Sam Raimi is the master at making B movies and that's what the original trilogy was, an epic scale B Movie. With this film, they get a little more serious. There's not really any goofy moments that I can think of and if there are then it's usually played for laughs.Also THANK GOD They got Flash Thompson right. Sam Raimi used Flash so he could be the stereotypical bully, and at the beginning you think that's what Marc Webb plans to do, but then he shows that Flash isn't as big a  as he makes himself out to be. Flash is one of my favourite Spider-man characters in the comics, and I'd like to say ""thank you Marc Webb for avoiding the cliché of him just being a bully and actually making him a human being with depth."" The film also does other things right besides avoiding clichés. The actors all do fantastic jobs and I will go on record saying that Andrew Garfield is the perfect Spider-man and a great role model for young boys even though he has his flaws. Martin Sheen was great as an Uncle Ben who is kind, understanding, but at the same time doesn't take any crap. Emma Stone was great as the kind of jokey but intelligent Gwen Stacy who is a strong positive role model for young woman. The Guy who played the villain was great, The girl who played Aunt May was good in the few scenes she was in. Not a weak link in the bunch.So I've done nothing but praise this film so far, so why is it still behind Spider-man 2 in my books? Well the film does have flaw, mainly two. One it's rushed, the only one who really pays for it being rushed is the villain who only gets one line of dialogue to explain his motives and even then we're not sure why he's doing that. The second flaw is that it doesn't have this big epic feel that Spider-man 2 had, it doesn't feel like it was ma",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
contemporary feel Spiderman leaves you unmoved but entertained,"For those of you interested in what this film is like and how the makers managed with this restart:It's not as good as Sam Raimi's version, this film reminds you of the strengths of his film rather than erasing your memory. I was a fan of the first film and it's two sequels but was willing to see where this one was going and what it could bring to the popular comic-book superhero, on the plus side the acting is good and the visuals have a sort of realism which is enjoyable, the way Spiderman moves and the acrobatic dynamism is exciting and well-executed. On the down-side the film is emotionally misjudged veering from almost excessive emoting of tragic events to flippant instant recovery, basically it comes across as shallow and insincere, maybe this is clumsiness or editing. Also the action scenes are a bit confusing, sometimes you wonder if you blinked and missed something like on the bridge sequence (not a spoiler, there is a bridge sequence like in Raimi's Spiderman but I'm not saying what happens!)It's worth seeing this film but not worth rushing to see it with high expectations, I expect that the tone is marketed towards young male demographic which it will please, but this is not good enough to be called a classic which Raimi's is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Chix Chat on Film Review: A Spiders tale respun.,"I still contend that it was too soon to reset the series, however The Amazing Spiderman was not too bad. The biggest problem for me was that the other actors who portrayed the key characters so recently were still very fresh in my mind. I did like that this Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) brought a heightened level of masculinity to the role or at least as much as could be expected for a man swinging through the city in red and blue tights with his junk on prominent display. So this time around the protagonist that Spiderman must square off against is Dr. Curt Conners (Rhys Ifans) who is pretty much an enigma the entire film, there are hints that he may have played a part in the death of Peters parents, there are hints that he is involved in some unscrupulous dealings within Oscorp, but nothing is ever clearly defined. Not even the basis of his greatest loss, which was his motivation for the research that led him to the genesis of the Lizard. Speaking of which, why did the Lizard remind me of Venon from the last Spiderman (Tobey Maguire)? I know he had scales and a tail, but he sure looked a lot like the same special effect. The story of Peter Parker and his encounter with a radio-active or genetically altered spider is consistently the basis of the transformation into Spiderman, even with his acclimation to his new abilities taking place very rapidly it still seemed tedious since it all just played out not so long ago. What I found to border on the ridiculous though was how easily Peter gained access to the spiders. A state of the art lab with state of the art technology and security would not have an area with potentially dangerous specimens so unattended, still it all just seemed too familiar. Same old same Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) solid pillars of the earth and nothing special. I will say that I enjoyed the romance that played out between Peter and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) as it seemed very organic, fresh and genuine. Obviously, there will be sequels, but now I have Mr. Garfield in my mind overlaying my visualization of Mr. Maguire as Spidey. If the sequel is fresh and has some new discovery for Peter in store, like really utilizing his 'spidey senses' then I may be a bit more enthusiastic about hitting the theater to check it out. As it stands 'been there, done that' so it gets an amber light.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Truly AMAZING,"The Amazing Spiderman was in fact amazing and i would recommend it to any one. However, the normal ""Spider-Man"" and ""Spider-Man 2"" were better. It's much different than other Marvel movies because Peter Parker is no billionaire or Playboy, he is a normal high school ""nerd"". One of the major flaws in the film was that the beginning 15-30 minutes went by very, very slow, but once the movie actually got captivating, it was fine. The main reason for the slowness is because the film had to take the viewers once again through the process of how Peter got his powers. If you haven't seen any of the other Spiderman films, this wouldn't affect you, but if you have, this could seem very laborious. About halfway through the movie, Spiderman had captured my heart and I found my self rooting for him the rest of the way through. Overall, I give Spiderman a 7 out of 10.Oh yeah, Stan Lee once again makes a cameo and it is pretty funny.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

There are three scenes in particular where the cut-away is sloppy and feels like a time lapse, but that's a personal nitpick and I suspect most viewers won't even notice.

"The best Peter Parker, but not the best Spider-Man","Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), an extremely intelligent but awkward teenager, wants to find out why his parents disappeared when he was young. His search leads him to scientist Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans); but it also leads him to getting bitten by a mutant spider, turning him into the Spiderman.I was never a big fan of the Sam Raimi-Tobey Maguire incarnation of Spider-Man, mainly because I'm not really a big fan of Maguire. So I was actually quite interested in this reboot, because I am a very big fan of Andrew Garfield, and I was interested to see what he could do.What he did, in the end, was give what I think is the best portrayal of Peter Parker to date. His speech patterns, his physicality, his presence on screen; everything about Garfield's performance was exactly how I imagined Peter Parker to be. And, coincidentally, Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy was also near-perfect. It helps that the two are a couple in real life, bringing their off-screen chemistry to their on-screen romance. It's very well done.And yet, despite two fantastic lead performances, this wasn't a very good movie. It was just okay. I found myself being bored for large parts of the movie, which you can't say very often for most Marvel movies. Part of the problem is that the villains don't hold up their end of the deal. Rhys Ifans is a very good actor, but I never felt a threat from The Lizard, as though this was a terrible danger for Spider-Man. Sure, the visuals are good, but that's not really enough. It also seemed like parts of the story had either been cut or shortened, certain sequences feeling rushed and undeveloped.Like all comic-book movies, there are the nods to the past, and that is always fun. And you have cameos from stalwarts like Martin Sheen, Sally Field and even Stan Lee himself, but it doesn't help the overall enjoyment of the movie. However, and maybe this is because of my appreciation for Garfield and Stone, but I'm willing to give them another chance. There is a sequel on its way, and I'm looking forward to it.

Very Good: 8.0,"Reboots/remakes are very controversial (let alone common) in Hollywood these days. Some of them have been welcomed (Star Trek, Casino Royale), and others not (Let Me In). The Amazing Spider Man, a reboot of the franchise begun by Sam Raimi's 2002 film, is one of the latter. Many critics seem predisposed to disregard this film, given the extremely positive response the original received. A similar thing happened when Let Me In first premiered: do we really need this movie, when the original was both great and relatively recent? The answer, of course, is no. But the fact remains that it exists, so critics should leave their grudges behind and concentrate on the film itself. Sam Raimi's version made light work of Peter Parker's transformation. Sure, the general concepts were in place; he gets bitten by a mutant spider, develops superhuman powers (though he cannot generate the webs himself in this version), and sees Uncle Ben get gunned down. And really, that was about it. Marc Webb, known for his well-handled rom-com 500 Days of Summer, imbues Spidey's origins with considerable depth and humanity. When Parker discovers his uncle's killer sports a tattoo, he pins any crook he can find to the wall to check if they're the right one. The chief of police points out that Spider Man doesn't seem to have any agenda, and is nothing more than a vigilante. After this, Peter seemingly decides that he can do far more than simply take vengeance, and decides to take on the real menace, The Lizard. Of Sam Raimi's trilogy, the best villain was Doc Ock, from Spider Man 2. As a character, he was fascinating, and brilliantly acted by Alfred Molina. The Lizard, whose human form is portrayed by Rhys Ifans, is little more than a miniaturized Godzilla with a plan. While Ifans plays his part quite well, The Lizard is simply not as charismatic or terrifying as Ock was. Like DOc Ock, however, The Lizard (AKA Curt Connors) is a sympathetic villain, with (initially) benign intentions that are completely understandable, and enough to pity him by the end of the film. Peter's love interest is Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), a smart, pretty, resourceful young woman who also happens to be the daughter of the police chief. She and Parker (Andrew Garfield) share excellent chemistry in their interactions, which director Webb exploits to its fullest potential. Their romance seems many times more genuine than that between Parker and Mary Jane from Raimi's trilogy. Parker himself is just as likeable, and far more unsure of himself. In this version, he stutters sometimes, and seems like the type of socially awkward nerd stereotype that everyone seems know someone like. It makes him easier to relate to, and thus easier to accept as a character, adding immeasurably to the film's human side. The other side of the film, of course, is the CGI-driven action. Sam Raimi, employed his signature style to his action, meaning that everything was complete chaos. Entertaining to be sure, but not always easy to follow. Webb anchors everything firmly in the realm of possibility (or at least as close as it can get), and there are no crazy gadgets flying through the air this time. Now, it's only Spider Man, the cops, and The Lizard. It all feels much more efficient and streamlined as a result, and becomes all the more thrilling because of it. Overall, I would recommend the reboot over the original, but only just. Sam Raimi may not have handled the dialogue and story as well, but is much more confident and fluid in the action space. When the inevitable sequel comes around, Webb might be able to take more risks with the web-sliging and baddy-wrangling, but until then, this is a very good film that no Spidey fan, casual or otherwise, should pass up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Heart of a Spider,"As a person who constantly yearns for new ideas, new stories, and new adventures, I found myself questioning my own morals in this film. When I look at the movies that have come out this year and are soon to come out, I see one word - unoriginal -- The Hobbit, The Dark Knight Rises, Les Miserables, Rock of Ages, Skyfall, The Hunger Games, and The Avengers. The last two have broken into the top fifteen US box office champions of all time! It's amazing how books, redo's, and sequels can be so wildly successful and yet so disconnected to originality.Tonight, I witnessed something beautiful and magnificent beyond belief however. I saw how two wonderful actors - Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone - could turn an extremely overdone and unnecessary reboot into something more lovely than any previous version.This is a completely original take on an overused classic tale, and it is solely due to the power of the main two actors. I don't know how to thank both of them enough. Expect your first Oscar nominations to both of you this year.To the Amazing Spider-Man and Gwen.

"""The Amazing Spiderman"" Delivers Action","It's hard to believe that after 10 years, the comic book adaptation ""Spiderman"" was being rebooted; normally a movie has to have at least 30 years under its belt before it's rebooted, but not in this instance. ""The Amazing Spiderman"" gives audiences a new tale on America's favorite web-slinger. Stepping into the shoes of Mr. Peter Parker is Andrew Garfield.What ""The Amazing Spiderman"" fails to decide is the tone of the picture? Do we have a comedic superhero or dark anti-hero that will emerge over time? At times I felt as if the comedic overtone took over the picture, but there are those shades of darkness throughout. Director Marc Webb conjures a visionary tale of a comic book icon that has mesmerized children and adults alike for years. Be sure to stay for the movie after the credits begin to roll, if you leave you will be dearly disappointed at the nice twist at the end of the movie. The movie is a fun ride for both children and adults, but I have an inkling adults will appreciate this new take on the web-slinger much more than they expected.To read the full review go to: www.canyon-news.com Be sure to like us on Facebook to get all the latest movie reviews at www.facebook.com/canyon.news.la OR Follow us on Twitter @cnewspaper",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Garfield and Stone Shine in a Franchise Reboot That Has Arrived Far Too Soon,"A reboot of the Spider-Man franchise feels awfully premature given it's only been a decade since the first Sam Raimi-directed epic hit the big screen with Tobey Maguire in the title role, and it's been just five years since the release of ""Spider-Man 3"". Moreover, some of us have had the misfortune of seeing the bombastic Broadway debacle that is ""Spider- Man: Turn Off the Dark"" this past year complete with an unmemorably deafening score by Bono. Here is yet another version of the superhero's familiar origin story presented in this 2012 adventure epic from director Marc Webb (""(500) Days of Summer"") and a trio of accomplished screenwriters - James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent (who co-wrote 2 and 3 of the previous trilogy as well as several classic films), and Steve Kloves (who adapted most of the ""Harry Potter"" series). Although they go back to Peter Parker's tragic childhood in the prologue, the set-up is otherwise identical to the previous iterations except aspiring actress Mary Jane Watson is nowhere to be seen. Instead, there is spunky Gwen Stacy, a police captain's daughter, the chief intern at the OsCorp Corporation, and Peter's high school crush.Webb focuses much of his movie, especially the first half, to the burgeoning relationship between Peter and Gwen, and this turns out to be a smart move since the screenwriters appear otherwise strait-jacketed by the recognizable constraints of the back story. Raised by his kindly Uncle Ben and Aunt May, Peter is the same brilliant geek and social outcast in this movie, but he's given a more brooding sense of anguish by Andrew Garfield (""The Social Network"") - who at 28, can still get away with playing a teen. The plot starts to accelerate when Peter stumbles upon his father's old briefcase filled with complex formulas that lead him to an old colleague of his father's, Dr. Curt Connors, now a top scientist at OsCorp. Connors' focus is on cross-species genetics which he hopes will produce ""a world without weakness"", a personal cause to him since losing his right arm. While at OsCorp, Peter gets bitten by a spider that gives birth to his super powers. When Uncle Ben is later killed by a thief during a sidewalk scuffle, Peter decides to become a vigilante hero who is at odds with the police, which of course, means butting heads with Gwen's by-the-book father.However, things really come to a head with the appearance of the Lizard, who causes havoc first in a fatalistic traffic jam on the Williamsburg Bridge and then at Peter's high school. The inevitable battle of good versus evil takes its toll on the city and on our beleaguered hero with the requisite special effects given a full showcase to bring the movie to a rousing finish. That finish occurs over a wearying 136-minute running time, fairly excessive given the familiarity of the story. Perhaps if the Lizard represented something more interesting than a straight-up Jekyll-and-Hyde metamorphosis, it wouldn't have felt quite as long. Although Webb handles the numerous action scenes with surprising acuity given this is only his second feature film as a director, he brings a level of personal intimacy to the movie that a typical action director would likely have bypassed so as not to alienate the fanboy audience. It's also a good thing that Webb hired two bright actors to bring human scale to the love story at the center of this comic book adventure. Beyond Garfield's solid work, a blonde Emma Stone brings her innately sharp manner to a character that could have easily turned into a simplistic damsel in distress.Together the two attractive leads have a palpable chemistry that bodes well for the inevitable sequels. Last seen as the suspicious academic in ""The Five-Year Engagement"", Rhys Ifans plays Connors with similar caginess and with the help of CGI effects, fulfills his villainous quotient fitfully. The rest of the stellar supporting cast feels somewhat underserved within the story's dimensions. Denis Leary plays Gwen's father with his trademark casual authority but perhaps at the expense of the character's needed gravitas toward the end. With two Oscars, Sally Field can certainly do more than look constantly concerned, the basic requirement here, but leave it to the veteran actress to provide more depth to the fretful Aunt May. Martin Sheen seems to have the best grasp on his character's blue-collar sensibilities as Uncle Ben. James Horner's music struck me as overly bombastic for the stealth-like movements of Spider-Man, while John Schwartzman's cinematography is a bit on the murky side during the nighttime shots, especially during the climax. I just wish the whole venture could have enthralled me more, but despite some clear virtues with this latest installment, Sam Raimi still casts too foreboding a shadow from my perspective.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Now THAT was Spider-Man!,"The Amazing Spider-Man is one of the greatest superhero movies ever made, and is bring the story of Peter Parker to a whole new, and exciting level that will keep you deeply interested.One of the best things about this movie, which makes it such a successful superhero movie is how closely it follows the comics. For example, the most obvious is that Gwen Stacy is the love interest, instead of Mary Jane Watson. And Peter actually has to be smart enough to build his own webbing, instead of them being handed to him by the radioactive spider.Which leads me into the fact that the movie nailed the character of Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man. He's not a social outcast like the original trilogy, but he's a sarcastic, socially awkward, genius which makes him much more entertaining then the original movie. It's believable that a girl could fall for Peter, unlike in the original where it seems absurd that Mary Jane would stoop herself so low. Andrew Garfield is born to be Spider-Man!In fact, every single cast member did their job and exceeded all possible extensions. You care about almost every single character, no matter how much screen time they get.ALMOST every single character, the exception being May Parker. But the attention she was given in the original trilogy goes to Ben Parker. But with more character development in the sequel, Aunt May could become just as endearing as she was in the original.The fight scenes were superb, with Stan Lee having his most hilarious cameo in a Marvel movie yet! The use of webbing and acrobatics keeps people entertained from the second a fight sequence begins. They far exceed the quality of the original trilogy.Overall, the movie was much better then the original trilogy, and I have high hopes for the sequel. I HIGHLY recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Nutshell Review: The Amazing Spider-Man,"I would never have thought Garfield as the right person for the job. But I'm glad that he had proved me wrong, just as how Marc Webb had unequivocally stated that we haven't seen nothing yet with what Garfield can do with the role. He morphed into Peter Parker the shy lad, like hand in glove, and then transformed into the heroic Spider-Man sans mask, straddling and struggling with his dual identities just as how any scrawny teenager would if to be blessed (or cursed) with new found abilities, highlighting awkwardness and the building of confidence to perfection. Webb knew exactly what he was looking for in a leading man and allowed plenty of emotional engagement and attachment to Garfield's Peter, with Garfield proving him right, and now carries the superhero mantle with aplomb, nailing it as an unlikely hero.Then there's Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, equally important as the romantic fodder for Peter Parker, and this update had given us a leading lady character who has beauty and brains combined, together with a degree of spunk that Mary Jane Watson in the previous three films had lacked, with the latter falling prey in each and every installment that it was getting pretty tired. Stone has proved to carry an entire film on her own, and here shares incredible chemistry opposite Garfield to make them that cute couple in school who have to battle the pangs of first love, and not only having to deal with that strong emotion, but loss as well. While that Maguire-Dunst upside down tongue gymnastics is something hard to beat, Garfield-Stone do have their little romantic stunt that adds a degree of fun that each of Raimi's version lacked. Which is a good thing especially when trying to sway over the nay- sayers.I suppose almost everyone out there will know what to expect already from an origin movie, and James Vanderbilt's story kicks off into high gear from the get go, weaving and setting a new stage and universe in which this version of Spider-Man will thrive under, with Oscorp being that scientific conglomerate headed by an unseen, but constantly mentioned Norman Osborn, and having the mythos deeply involving the corporation, opening doors to possibilities that any subsequent film can cover, especially with that end credits scene. It also picked up from the Batman Begins template in a number of areas, but I'm not complaining because it's all good to successfully reboot the franchise, adapting elements from its comic book source which serve as canon, but giving it a different angle that maintains the spirit of things and events, even key ones like Uncle Ben's demise that truly shaped the destiny of the wall-crawler.As always with the Spider-Man mythos, Peter Parker deals more with loss, and loses more than he's won, and having that retained in the film made it venture down a darker road, and being more vulnerable. And going back to basics never hurt, with one single villain in Dr Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) as the Lizard, even if an army of Lizards were hinted at from merchandise, and keeping/hinting at others who may appear in subsequent movies. The villain-hero set up was reminiscent of the second Raimi film with Peter Parker and Dr Octopus sharing a connection before the latter went bonkers, and provided yet again another battle on the emotional front. The Lizard may be lesser known, but is a powerful foe that audiences may have already been primed for from Raimi's films if they were to do a little research on the recurring Connors character then.Action wise, Webb had gotten excellent material from the comics and clearly dipped into them for inspiration, with Spidey's iconic poses and movement all making it into the film, coming off as poetry in motion. This was something that the earlier Spider-Man films had paled in comparison, with action sequences all being more kinetic in treatment, utilizing a whole slew of Spider-abilities. And the mechanical web shooters weren't all that bad, since again it went back to basics to showcase Parker's intellect, if only for a short while during a montage as does showing off his sewing skills. Webbing plays a big role in being the arsenal of choice, and the variation shown in this film is staggering, with the previous films never even coming close to how this Spider-Man excelled in fighting with them. And with those webshooters, you'll be itching for moments when the web fluid would run out, or to have something happen to them like how the Stan Lee (probably the best cameo appearances of all Marvel films here) devised in his stories, just to provide additional challenge.Marc Webb had shown not only Sam Raimi can make a good Spider-Man summer blockbuster, and I'm pretty sure Webb's version can stand up to and probably excel from the predecessors.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Why fix it if it ain't broke...,"While many people are asking ""why reboot a movie just five years later"", many others are still saying that Sam Raimi's trilogy swung into a brick wall after Spiderman 3 (2007). By the looks of it, this is not just a remake, but the re-boot of a new Marvel franchise. Is it needed? Well, if 2012 is the year of the superheroes, then more the merrier. Right?Personally, I thought the whole movie is one misplaced pun with Marc Webb stepping in as the new director. The story however, is not new. As a high school teenager, Peter parker (Andrew Garfield) has issues of his own. Orphaned at a very young age, Peter has since lived with his uncle and aunt, but finds his parents' disappearance a hushed mystery. Additionally, he is bullied at school as a misfit and science geek. If all this were too much to bear, peer pressure blows a gasket when the inevitable happens – the bite of a genetically engineered spider that endows Peter with 'amazing' superhuman abilities. The rest, as any superhero aficionado will tell you, is history. That little synopsis should tell you that this is a remake that borrows, albeit heavily, from Raimi's screenplay that is just about 10 years old. For me this appears to be one major stumbling block. Sure, Webb spins his own yarn with little tidbits that seem to re-illustrate forgotten pages from our wall-crawler's Marvel origins; a web shooter, a bluer costume and some fancy fight moves to recall a few. Then there is the likable Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) instead of Mary Jane Watson, who by the way, has a fate that is altered for the movie but swapped less favorably by her father - NYPD Captain George Stacy (Dennis Leary).Fresh as it may look, a remake in such a short span of cinematic memory can only mean that Webb has gone in guns blazing, or, was made to be the sacrificial lamb by studio bosses, should the cash cow refuse to budge. But as it seems, it's not all bad once the action starts. Cinematography although not picture perfect, works well as a mega teaser for New York City. Thanks to some first-person camera work, we not only see some of New York's vantage points, but also what it must feel like to crawl over and swing through those skyscrapers. Again, this is fairly rewarding for viewers opting for the pricier 3D tickets, but look around and you may find that just about every major blockbuster is released in 2D, 3D, and IMAX. Did someone mention cash cow? For this reviewer, the highpoint of this reboot are the character renditions by Garfield and Stone, both individually and as a pair of love-struck teens. Probably one of the very few areas where Webb has the one up on Raimi is Garfield's bolder Peter Parker, with or without the costume; an instantly noticeable upgrade on Toby Maguire's timid and hesitant Parker. Of course, every super hero must do battle with a super villain and this is the cue for Dr. Curtis Connors (Rhys Ifans), a scientific genius at Oscorp. If you asked me, Ifans does a better job as Dr. Connors as compared to when he turns into the reptilian humanoid called The Lizard. As literal as this may sound, the Lizard-man is the wrecking ball that manages to do more damage to the movie than any good at all. Perhaps I was the only gob smacked viewer in the auditorium, but my disbelief stems from my cemented opinion that the Lizard is a miniature (plasticky look and all) version of Godzilla and a bad replica at that. Seriously Webb? Ishirō Honda's ""Godzilla"" all but tore through cinema screens in 1954 but that is no excuse not to have used over 40 years of technological advancements to give the Lizard a palpable look and feel.And so the answer to my question earlier remains a firm NO. There was no real need for this reboot given there was nothing really wrong with the preceding storyline. And trust me; we who love cinema are not short of celluloid memory. But now that we have a remake, Marc Webb can only redeem himself by bringing out a sequel that will win over the hoards of Sam Raimi fans. Including Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Should be renamed ""Peter Parker: High School Drama""","It was not even 10 years since the first spiderman movie, starring Tobey Mcguire, was released to critical acclaim and financial success. Despite deviating somewhat from the comic books, the movie stay true to the spirit of the source material and was lauded by both comic fans and casual movie watchers alike. Enter THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, the first in a new trilogy of movies based on Marvel's favorite web-slinger. With a promise to adhere closer to the comic books, the film goes back to explore Spiderman's origin once again. A genetically altered Spider's bite, a death in the family, a promise made, a responsibility accepted. But once we get down to the specifics, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN becomes its own unique creature.The overall tone is closer to a character centered teenage romance drama than a Superhero blockbuster. Teenager Peter Parker, played by Andrew Garfield, is less of Tobey Mcguire's lovable loser and more of a misunderstood social outcast; seething with angst, awkward with girls, prefers to be alone. Abandoned by his parents under mysterious circumstances, Peter was raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. In high school, he grapples with finding his sense of identity and finding his first high school crush in the form of snowy haired Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). One day, Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father which leads him to Oscorp and his father's science partner Dr Curt Connors. An accident grants Peter Parker with spider-like powers but also results in a new scaly menace intent on wiping out human life.From the get go, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN shows itself to be a very competent human drama film. Relationships are the focus here. We get an insight into how Peter's relationships with his Uncle Ben affects his choice to become a masked vigilante. Martin Sheen completely nails the protective ""tough love"" yet gentle personality of Uncle Ben from the comics. It feels very natural and this makes his eventual death weigh even more on Peter's life changing decisions. Similarly the chemistry between Peter and Gwen is more nuanced than the more fairy tale like romance between Peter and Mary Jane from the Sam Raimi trilogy. Overall, the characters are definitely more grounded in reality, fully developed and easy to relate to.However it is this move to try and ground the movie in reality that is also one of its many downfalls. Although director Marc Webb perfectly captures the emotional aspect of the movie, he seems to have trouble grappling the drama with the action. Once Spiderman dons the mask, the film splits itself into two movies: ""Peter Parker: High School Romance"" and ""Spiderman Begins"". This shift in tone can be jarring and similarities to ""Batman Begins"" abound: a parental figure killed in front of our protagonist, setting most of the action at night, a darker tone, even the plot thread of the authorities hunting our masked vigilante. Unlike Batman Begins, however, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN hints on themes but never develops them; a likely result of giving too much weight to Peter Parker's emotional drama. The theme about the power of anonymity behind a mask, for example, is a poignant one befitting the Internet age yet is only touched upon but never focused on.Not surprisingly, director Marc Webb is more known for romance drama ""500 Days of Summer"" than any blockbuster. Like a Basketball player handed a golf club, Webb fumbles about once the Superhero plot is introduced. His lingering long shots are eschewed for fast whip cuts and close ups in fight scenes making much of the action difficult to follow if it were not for Spidey's bright hued outfit. Our villain is basically Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus redux: a well intentioned scientist driven to madness by a lab accident, developing a ""Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde"" personality only to come to his senses in the end.His strong point, the human drama, also suffers at this point where we have Peter and Gwen being the adorable awkward couple at one moment and then madly in love the next moment after a family dinner. In making Peter Parker a socially awkward skateboarding kid instead of the complete nerd drifting through a crappy life, the story of gaining great power and learning great responsibility carries less impact. He already has a rebellious nature, he already stands up to bullies, he already talks back to authority figures. That metamorphosis from zero to hero hardly takes place. Ironic that a movie with two very clashing story styles never manages to convey the dichotomous personality of the shy doormat Peter Parker and the heroically resolute Spiderman.The dichotomy in the movie's tone and style can be seen even in the film score by James Horner. His softer piano based tunes set during the ""Peter Parker"" convey the constant inner turmoil Peter has to grapple with; there is an underlying sense of somberness to the emotions. On the other hand, Horner's action cues and main hero fanfare are sadly generic. Danny Elfman composed a dramatic, subtle yet memorable score with tunes that just ooze ""arachnid"". Horner here gives us plain old ""heroic"" with a hero theme that sounds like a combination of ""Batman and Robin"" and Ang Lee's ""Hulk"". A sad turn from the composer who brought us the epic sweeping scores of Aliens and Avatar.If one were to compare, The Amazing Spider-man would rate as the 3rd best among the 4 Spiderman films in existence just slightly behind Spiderman 1 but significantly better than the muddled mess of Spiderman 3. It is an emotionally touching coming-of-age movie, heavy on teenage drama and characters anyone can relate to. Sadly it is a mediocre superhero film, floundering in its schizophrenic switch of tone between drama and action instead of blending them together.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Good Film but Doesn't Jive with the Other Spiderman Films,"I went last evening with a friend to see Spiderman. It was nice to see what happened when he was a little child, but after that the chain of events did not match up very well with the previous Spiderman Films.First off I thought that Doctor Connor was Peter Parkers college professor. In this film they have him working for Ozcorp and at the end he is put into prison. Either he must of gotten a short sentence or whatever but how can you have him in 3 Spiderman films as a college professor and in this film a scientist/villain Also, in all the other films we had the girlfriend M.J. and now we have Gwynn? In the other films Peter had a crush on Mary Jane, not Gwynn. It also took a while for Peter to let Mary Jane know that he was Spiderman, where in this film it like there is no hesitation in letting anyone know his true identity.Also, in Spiderman 3 they have the killer of his Uncle Ben as the Sandman. It was not a guy who was robbing a convenience store. Plus Uncle Ben was in a car, not walking along the street. Plus, there was another criminal involved with the Sandman.You can see that they are going to have another one because you have the unknown person talking to Dr. Connor in prison, plus they have to develop the romance between Peter and Gwynn.I realize that the other spiderman films set the mark with regards to theme, actors and so forth. Making a film to erase all that had to have been difficult. But I'm sure I'm not the only one who is confused at the storyline that they had in this film.

"The amazing spiderman is ""AMAZING""","Firstly I found the last 3 spiderman movies boring and fully expected this one to be much of the same. How wrong could I have been the cast do a great job of bringing the characters to life, I see so many films where I just don't care about the main characters and in some case if they all died it would make the film a hell of a lot more interesting. But here you become really involved in there lives and I think this is because of the humour which is great and just adds to the likability of each character. The effects are awesome and even the lizard looks good which I wasn't expecting. Normally CGI characters look average at best (I don't like CGI at all) like the hulk in the various adaptations but here it works. From the trailer I thought some of the 1st person shots of spiderman swinging through the streets were gimmicky but again I was wrong Marc Webb does an excellent job and picks some amazing shots to showcase spiderman in action. I personally enjoyed this more than the avengers and for the first time ever i'am looking forward to a spiderman sequel.

"A good, but not great, re-introduction to the world of (your friendly neighborhood) Spider-Man","Being the Spider-Man fanatic that I am (and I mean that sincerely), I went into this movie with high hopes. Extremely high. Needless to say this movie was a humbling experience which showed me that just because a series is popular enough to be rebooted, doesn't mean that the reboot will do the series itself justice. With that being said, this movie was leagues ahead of Sam Raimi's trilogy of whatever bad noun you can think of and set itself up for future movies.For anyone who has ever read Amazing Spider-Man #6, first appearance of The Lizard, this movie follows that plot to a T. Well, maybe half a T, but you get my point. A more modernized version of ASM #6 that's not set in the Everglades. Peter Parker, your average skate boarding high school-er, stumbles into a lab in Oscorp (after sneaking in of course) and gets bitten by a (radioactive) spider. What follows is one and a half hours of slightly sloppy action, minor romance and astounding graphics.So we'll start with the good news. The cinematography and graphical design was absolutely fantastic. Could not have been done better. The special effects on the Lizard were so real you could tell his skin was slimy and his fingers were razor sharp. Scenes of Spider-Man swinging from building to building interloped nicely with scenes of Spider-Man fighting bad guys or getting annoyed by cops. The fight scenes were credible, but could have been done better but the placement of all the characters and fluidity of motions exhibited by the pro- and antagonist of the movie made up for lack of ""pazzaz"" during action sequences. Slow motion was seldom used, but when it was it was equipped nicely and never became shopworn. The way the Lizard tore things apart while throwing them at innocent bystanders, along with Spider-Man, was choreographed perfectly and all-in-all the movie's graphical prowess is where the majority of the gold lies.Behind solid acting, Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield (along with bits and pieces of Rhys Ifans) carry the movie forward and their torrid love affair never gets in the way of Parker being Spider-Man. The chemistry between these two is good and hilarious at times, because Garfield really has that whole ""awkward science nerd"" thing down pat. Aunt May and Uncle Ben were the weakest acting roles in the whole movie, and that is now dis to Sally Field or Martin Sheen. They just didn't have enough of an impact, as characters, on Parker's story and family life to have a lasting appeal to the audience. Ben's obligatory death wasn't heartfelt or difficult to bear - it just, sort of, happened. Aunt May never gave one of her ""there's a hero in all of us"" speeches (a la Spider-Man 2) and therefore didn't strike a chord in the proverbial storyline.I wish I could tell you more without giving up spoilers, but I really can't. Aside from the facts that I just gave you, expect clichés and corniness throughout the film. Innocent bystanders trying to be heroes and things to that nature. And going along with the recent trend of after-credits nuggets that Marvel oh-so wonderfully set up, this movie contains a ""preview"" (if one could call it that) of the next film. I am debating on whether putting a question mark at the end of the sentence because that after-credits scene did absolutely nothing for me.Enough of my talking. Here's the low down:+2 for Garfield's perfect (and hot, no homo) portrayal of Spider-Man+1 for Stone's great portrayal of Stacy+3 for graphics/cinematography+1 for comic nerd appeal",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Creative Writers,Great way to start off a new spider man franchise. Andrew and Emma are fantastic actors and shocked me with this movie. The writers are very creative and I have to say I loved the way they tried to make a different story with this series.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good action and actors but bad director and script,"First I will comment that this film let me a bit frustrated because it is a mediocre film when it could be a great film with only minors modifications all around Spider-man nonsense actions. I will say a few examples of BAD THING:_Spider-man constantly take off his mask without any reason (why?, only to see main character face?) _Perter Parker showing is new strong and athletic powers (are Peter stupid or what?)_some parts of film, like discovering is power, are rushed and have few minutes and other insignificant actions, like how he enter in Oscorp, to plot take a lot of time (what did think the director?). Making the film have a big holes in the argument progression._The romance in film looked lukewarm, forced and superficial._Peter is not a nerd and is personality have not big change after become spider-man and be Spider-man seems as a play thing until the end of film (how can one create attachment to Peter/Spider-man with this ""cool"" Peter from beginning. Other time what the hell is the director thinking?)_...:(But not all is bad, lets do a list of GOOD THINGS:_Good actors (to bad that script and directors don't make them shine with more deep personality characters)_Very good special effects_Credible bad guy character_Good actions scenes with villain involved (not others irrelevant scenes)In resume, not being a bad movie is not good neither, is a bit insubstantial in plot and characters development making only another hero movie that will no be remembered is not a well recognized hero like Spider-man was the main character. I know that normally no good make comparatives but I will because others Spider-man films are very recent and the director have to considerate that people will make comparatives. If you compare to the Spider-man of 2002, this is catastrophic losing in all aspects to his predecessor.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Spider-Man is rebooted to mostly successful results giving a distinct approach to the character and lore.,"Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is an intelligent high school outsider. As a boy Peter was left by his parents Richard and Mary (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz) to be raised by aunt May and uncle Ben (Sally Field and Martin Sheen) only for Richard and Mary to mysteriously die in a plane crash shortly thereafter. Peter evidentially stumbles upon his father's personal effects which leads him to investigate bio-science company Oscorp and one of Richard's colleagues, Dr. Curtis Conners (Rhys Ifans), who worked with Richard on cross-species genetics. Peter investigates Oscorp where classmate and crush, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) works as an intern and Peter is bitten by a spider from one of the labs. Eventually Peter starts to exhibit enhanced strength as well as the ability to stick to walls and following the death of his Uncle Ben begins to form a reputation as masked vigilante Spider-Man and at odds with the police department headed by Gwen's father George Stacy (Dennis Leary). Meanwhile, Dr. Connors is under increasing pressure from Oscorp's dying CEO Norman Osborn and using a compound made from lizard DNA based on Richard Parker's formula ends up becoming a reptilian human hybrid, known as The Lizard, intent on spreading the compound throughout the city.Following the commercial success of Spider-Man 3, Sony and Sam Raimi had every intention of moving forward with Spider-Man 4 as well as preliminary discussions regarding Spider-Man 5 and 6, however the mixed critical and fan feedback lead to tensions between Raimi and the studio as the overcluttered narrative of Spider-Man 3 was the result of Sony's insistence on Venom's inclusion to plant seeds for a spin-off and with Raimi suffering from burnout from the tumultuous development cycle of Spider-Man 3 and already butting heads with Sony over whether The Lizard or The Vulture would be the primary antagonist, Raimi departed from Spider-Man 4 and the rest of the cast soon followed suit. Sony had already planned for such a contingency with writer James Vanderbilt producing a treatment that would eventually be directed by 500 Days of Summer director Marc Webb and feature Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy. The results despite covering familiar ground were surprisingly good and gave a different experience from the Raimi movies.Andrew Garfield gives a more contemporary take on the character with his interpretation of Peter Parker being less in line with the broad silver age inspired take of Magurie's Peter Parker and mining the more contemporaneous attitude of ""Nerd culture"" that's much more mainstream than it was in the 1960s. While Peter is still very much an outsider in High School, the portrayal of it feels like an attempt to ground it more in our reality than the previous Sam Raimi movies that were trying to replicate the environment and delivery of the 60s comics and characters but placed in modern day. The Peter Parker of The Amazing Spider-Man is also a much more active protagonist where Peter's story in the opening almost plays him like a teen sleuth with the lingering mystery of his parents connection with Oscorp as well as their death in a plane crash used for some tense scenes that also work in justifying Peter going to Oscorp where he receives his Spider powers from the bite. Emma Stone is also quite good as Gwen Stacy who not only has strong chemistry with Peter and works as a love interest, but her relationship with Peter where she becomes the only Confidant of Peter's who knows he's Spider-Man as well as a intellectual equal to Peter gives her more agency as a character than Mary Jane Watson had from the Raimi movies with some solid scenes of Stacy assisting Spider-Man. Rhys Ifans is good playing damaged scientist Curtis Conners and the scenes Ifans shares with Garfield are really solid as Peter learns about his father from Conners while Curtis also sees a bit of Richard in Peter and there's a strong undercurrent to these scenes that make them very rich in character. Ifans also does well portraying Conners' transformation into The Lizard in a way that's more than a little reminiscent of Jeff Goldblum's take from the David Cronenberg helmed The Fly remake.The action are really solid as they build upon techniques from the Raimi movies but also adjust them to the new world created by the movie. Unlike the Raimi version of Peter, this incarnation of Peter doesn't shoot webs from his wrists and is positioned as a technically accomplished genius with his web shooters gadgets that he builds using Oscorp tech. There's also a lot more weight to the action and some solid scenes showing Peter's rough Spider-Man costume to the eventual final costume.The major points of criticism I think will be in regards to the retelling of Spider-Man's origin story and in the Oscorp conspiracy plotline involving Peter's parents that while inspired from revelations in the comic-book does feel at odds with Spider-Man's everyman core. While the movie does give us different takes on Aunt May and Uncle Ben that have more dimensionality than they had in the Raimi films, it doesn't disguise the fact that we already know Uncle Ben's story significance and what happens to him. I also didn't feel like Sally Field's take on Aunt May ever achieved the level of chemistry with Garfield's Peter that Rosemary Harris had with Tobey Maguire in the Raimi films. The movie also doesn't give us much satisfaction in its conspiracy plotline that's pretty obviously set-up to be a driver for sequelization.The Amazing Spider-Man works well as an origin story for a new take on Peter Parker. With a strong supporting cast and some exhilarating fight scenes, the movie manages to overcome its origin story baggage with a mostly successful take on the character and lore. While the background plot involving the mysteries behind Peter Parker's parents is inspired from developments in the comic book, whether you like it or not will vary from person to person.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just Spiderman,"OK The Amazing Spider-man is not a bad film, but is not great either. It is different from 2002 spider man mainly because of a villain and other characters.The movie is soft, it is typical superhero movie- hero rises villain is created they fight hero wins. The end.That is also the case here. Web added a new story, story of spider-mans parents. I didn't enjoyed it at all! Why? Because is only partly done. Only thing you learn about them is that they left him when he was very young and that his father was working with Dr.Conners. I know that we will learn more about them in sequels but it leaves viewer empty.That was the first think annoying me.Second think: The villain!OK Dr. Curt Connars/Lizard is great character! But they should put more time in their's relationship which off course wasn't given. He just comes to his home and they become friends. Its like you would give Two-Face for the first Batman villain. NO!. The character must develop!Third think: Gwen Stacy.I don't know why but by the end of film the only character that i got to know is spider man. They like don't talk to each other and then are like together ... i mean what the barely even know each other.Fourth think: Every body knows who spider man is!Like everybody. Gwen, her father, some kid, Conner's, and some random people in New York. In previous trilogy every spidey villain gets o know who spidey is... but OK they all die at he end, here hes like hey i am spider man...The movie has a lot of flaws. But acting is good, lizard is amazingly done and they were some funny scenes.But please for love of god i hope the sequel would have an actual story something to think about not just some movie you just watched.

A solid start for the new cast.,OK I went into this movie with low expectations. After totally hating spiderman 3 I thought it was time to just let spiderman stay retired. But after seeing it I was surprised. It was good. Something that I would actually recommend to go see. The new cast added a much needed spark to spiderman and it shows throughout the movie. Its not even close to how dark and weird the last spiderman movie was. Its more light hearted with corny jokes in it that will give you a chuckle. It has some good action and its suspense will at least keep you interested for the entire movie. Don't get me wrong this is not movie of the year or even movie of the summer. But its a solid start to the amazing spiderman franchise and I believe they have a good future going forward.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Surprisingly, the reboot surpasses the original","The Amazing Spider-Man, in my honest opinion, is better than the Sam Raimi trilogy. Not by much and both franchises have their fair share of both good and bad, but on average, the new ones are better. As controversial as that sounds, and I know there are those that don't share my sentiments at all.But, let me explain. The two main reasons why I think The Amazing Spider-Man is better are Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. I never quite liked Tobey Maguire in the originals. Sure he made for a very convincing Peter Parker at his most geekiest, but I never bought him as Spider-Man. Garfield, on the other hand, can do both. Sure his Peter Parker is a more self-confident take on the character. He's more of an oddball tech genius than a nerd, but that's a valid take on the character so I have no complaints. Plus that characterization lends much more easily to what Spider-Man, at his core, should be: a trickster. Add in Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy and you have one of the best romantic pairings ever seen in a superhero movie. The two have incredible chemistry together and you'll totally buy they're in love. Plus Gwen Stacy is a lot of fun. She's active, independent, genius in her own right and actually has a role in the film beyond being the romantic interest and a damsel in distress.Furthermore, the advances in special effects are put to a good use and the action scenes are very cool to look at. The actual settings are perhaps a bit more ordinary than in the originals, but the fighting styles are more varied and you can feel the speed of the combat. There are also some really cool slow motion scenes, reminding me of the Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes films.The one aspect where this film is clearly inferior is unfortunately the villains. The ones in the originals were given a lot of depth and emotion and they were certainly memorable. Sure they were goofy, but that was part of the charm. Not so much in this one. The style overall is more realistic and perhaps even a bit darker, which hits the villains the hardest. They just aren't that interesting or memorable without the over-the-topness.It's also worth noticing that the storyline is very similar to the first Spider-Man. Usually a reboot that just rehashes the same would be doomed to failure, but this time it surprisingly works. Once again the stronger actors pull this film back from the brink.In the end it comes down to a matter of taste. Do you like Tobey Maguire or strong, enjoyable villains? Then you'll probably prefer the originals. Do you want to see a more joking, confident Peter Parker and a romantic lead that's actually worth a damn? Then The Amazing Spider-Man might just surprise you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I've developed a deeper appreciation for this film,"I don't have the same any nostalgia for the Webb dualogy as I do the Raimi trilogy. At the tail end of 2021, after watching No Way Home, I decided to rewatch the TASM movies. I remembered very little other than liking them. And it was one of those few times where I felt like I was watching something for the first time ever again.I'll say that I have no bitterness towards canceling Spider-Man 4. I thought Tobey Maguire's story was over and was always cool with a new take on Peter Parker.As the credits rolled, I wrote down the first thing sticking out to me in that moment. This film has a great score. It's not the same thing as Danny Elfman's memorable rhythm, but it really struck a chord with me.Touching on everything else, this is still a great movie. It has a good sense of humor like the Raimi trilogy and I laughed a handful of times. The visual style is also superb. This movie looks even better than Raimi's movies. Everything gives off a shimmer and glow in this movie. It gives natural light this fantastic neon edge that makes every shot look like eye-candy.The framing and kinetic energy are all great too. The camera moves in such a dynamic, yet steady way that follows the action like it's being pulled into every fight. Not a single shot stands still and proves just how creative Spider-Man's fighting style can be.The effects have aged much better than I expected too. Lizard looks leagues better here than he did in No Way Home. I remember TASM2 having my favorite Spider-Man suit, so I thought this suit wasn't going to look as good in motion, but it's aged extremely well. It gives Peter the intimidating characteristic he needs while he's still being a vigilante in this movie and not yet a real hero-which is a great take on him.Andrew Garfield's character is brasher and doesn't immediately feel guilty for his mistakes. His arc into being a hero is slower and natural. And Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy is the best female lead we ever got. She's not a damsel or a mouthpiece of weightless platitudes like MJ is for the two other trilogies. And Sally Field is just... wow. What an amazing actress. Her stress, anger, and feeling of responsibility for Peter make me cry. Her take is much more of the ideal mother than the role model grandma of Rosemary Harris.This film really plays that up too. There's a lot more attention to parenthood in this movie. Ben and May wanting to be Peter's parents and Gwen being close with her dad are really at the forefront here. Marc Webb nails character relationships and that hasn't changed. Even the crane scene made sense to me more than I remembered. It was the ""citizens coming together to help Spider-Man"" moment that were iconic staples in the first trilogy and this film really sells it on Peter not being able to make the jump he needs to while injured to reach OsCorp Tower. Needless to say, I immensely enjoyed this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Still thinks the Spidey from The Electric Company is the best, lol!","I have to start my review by saying - how many times do superhero movies have to end with a boss fight at the top of a hi-tech research tower? Geez, come on writers, write! Don't just repeat what others had done or put in scenes that ought to be there because of genre! Sorry I had to get that off my chest quickly because it had really bugged me for a while.Now onto the review......ok, maybe there isn't much else I would like to say that hasn't already been said.Good movie but not a Super movie, simply because so much of it has already been done, not just in superhero movies, but movies in general. Nerdy boy gets bullied, nerdy boy falls in love with a pretty blonde intellectual girl; finds a way to overcome growing pains, etc, etc.I am not a fan of Sam Raimi's version, and I think this one has a better visual tone that fits in better with the rest of recent Marvel entries (albeit with lamer CGI). However, I will not deny that Sam's rendition is a little more light-hearted and more fun to watch in parts than this.I have no doubt that the makers wanted to get this reboot out quickly so that they can move on to fresher stuff in sequels. And for that purpose, this is a strong enough start.Ultimately, it's still worth the cash to go see I guess, but just stay away from the 3D version!

"Twilight Spiderman, Are you team Spiderman or team Parker?","I apologize ahead of time if there is bad spelling or grammar. This  being my first review for IMDb, I wanted it to be a positive one and I  was waiting for The Amazing Spider-man to do it. I must admit I had  high expectations for this movie. Setting myself for High expectation  is not a great thing to do, because it could never live up to my  expectations. I knew I would be let down a little. I had no idea that  my expectation would be crushed. First thing I should start off with.  If you are expecting a Spider-man story, don't. Expect a Peter Parker  love story with some great action. I have read spider-man stories for  years and I loved the connection that Gwen Stacey and Spider-man had  together. What I do not like is twihard, romance novel like eye candy  up on the screen. When sitting in the movie, I had to deal with the  girls talking about how hot they thought Peter Parker was. My immediate  thought was ""Peter is me, a nerd, sense when has any girl found me  attractive?"" I realized that he was the epitome of what tweens found  attractive. He may be playing a nerd but he certainly does not look  like one. Then I experienced something that I hope no spider-man fan  should ever go through. when Peter took of his clothes, My EARS FELT  LIKE THEY WHERE GOING TO SPLIT OPEN! Because the girls in the theater  screamed so loud for peter having no shirt on. I should have sold my  ticket on ebay. There was redeeming factors for this movie, like I said  before there is some great action and an amazing cast to pull it off.  The relationship between Peter, Dr.Connors and the friction between  Captain Stacy was great. The origin story of Peter seemed more  plausible then Sam's Spider-man (More realistic?) But what made this  crushingly unwatchable, for me, was the way the romance was written,  then seeing it play out. This coming from a guy who love some well  written romance movies (like The Notebook). What I am trying to say is. Headline for this movie should be. Spider-man, a love story.  Maybe I am over reacting. I did see it with a bunch of screaming girls.  If you are going to see this movie. Whether you think it will be good  or not, see it a good two weeks after the release to avoid the large  Twilight crowd.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A mostly worthy and thoroughly modern reboot,"Ten years is clearly a long time in the movie business. The original Spiderman with Tobey Maguire on-board, debuted in 2002 and there followed two sequels, all box office successes.With Maguire unwilling to continue the franchise, we now have a reboot clearly aimed at an audience who will view the origin story as fresh and original.Andrew Garfield fills the Spidey suit and Emma Watson is his highschool sweetheart, Martin Sheen and Sally Field bag the Uncle and Auntie roles respectively.The story must be known to most but in summary, camera wielding Peter Parker is the usual weakling school misfit, who has been left to be brought up by his Uncle and Aunt, following the mysterious disappearance of his mother and father.Bitten by chance by a genetically modified spider, he develops webslinging and enhanced powers that ultimately he will come to use in the pursuit of bad guys, whilst dressed in a cool, Spiderman outfit. Essentially a coming of age story but writ large with superpowers and the intrinsic responsibilities that come in the same box.Garfield is a serious actor and here demonstrates just that, handling the initial scenes well, helped of course by veteran actors who remember when acting was actually required in a film. Stone is a great counterpoint, all her usual screen perkiness is on display together with some rather neat sexy socks thrown in for good measure. Unlike some action films, her role gets some good screen time and takes a proactive part in the climactic scenes.Bad Guy duties fall to Rhys Ifans as Dr Connor, this is hardly a spoiler as he is the obvious candidate and makes a good cold blooded killer, in every sense.So far so good but this is almost a film of two halves or segments. Whenever there is character interaction and real acting involved, the film works very well. Directer Marc Webb (500 days of summer) knows how to use his actors and there are several touching scenes. Where the film occasionally falters is in the action sequences.Like all modern blockbuster, action sequences are required and must continue to top the last film with ever more impossible fights and sights. This drives all modern films into the computer to generate the spectacle and increasingly as it becomes more fantastic, it becomes less real and dissipates any real tension or interest for the audience.Interestingly a couple of scenes are filmed from a first person perspective, resembling a computer game which in some sequences, the film does imitate.There are are some weak throwaway lines during the action which also jar, which is a shame as the film as a whole works well and these drag you away from caring about the characters. A sequence involving cranes only lacks an American flag to celebrate American ""can do"" attitude and will give foreign audiences a wry smile, subtle it is not.Just like comparing tennis stars from different era's, it is probably pointless making comparisons to previous versions and the film should be treated on it's own merits and standalone it does. As all origin films must, the remaining story has to be wrapped up fast and this is no exception.Dennis Leary gets a decent part and plays the character in his usual laconic way, Ifans does well with the limited time he is actually on the screen as himself.Garfield is a worthy replacement, the requirement for an increasing amount of CGI is not his fault, he does well with the on screen time he is given, he also gets to keep the mask off for extended periods. This film will clearly move him into the A list of ""go to actors""SummaryA mostly worthy and thoroughly modern reboot for the next generation. The film shines when real interaction and acting is allowed, becoming less interesting during each action sequence.This equation will of course be inverted, the closer your age is to the target audience.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Darker Spiderman that explores more of the emotional side,Andrew Garfield is probably the best iteration of Spiderman on screen. He fits the outcast yet confident role perfectly. His Spiderman nails the humour and wise cracks perfectly. The Lizard was great in this but drew too many similarities to Venom I think. He was not a well thought out villain. Otherwise the action scenes abd character scenes are perfect. The on screen chemistry between all the characters is great. The suit is amazing. My one and only problem with the movie is how open Peter Parker leaves his identity open to be figured out. In realistic terms he would have a short career. With a better script and villains I think Andrew Garfield would be the best version of Spiderman/Peter Parker.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Played Up But Did Not Deliver,"When I went into this movie, I admit; I was pretty hyped about it. The main reason was the amount of publicity it received, which can be a good thing or a bad thing. In this case, it was a bad thing. I can't go on reviewing this movie without comparing it to the 3 previous Tobey Maguire movies. Andrew Garfield, who plays Spiderman in this movie, is tall, gangly, and cocky in my opinion. He takes off his mask way too many times to be wanting to keep his identity as Spiderman a secret. I thought Emma Stone was good as Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker's boyfriend, but she found out he was Spiderman a little too soon.Overall, this movie did not hit it off with me. It probably had a lot to do with the fact that I loved the other Spiderman movies and compared them too much to this installment. I hope this review was helpful to you and I'm sorry if it was not.

Spider,"I do not dispute that many people really did not fully like Sam Raimi's film ""Spider-Man 3"", but our favorite actors, led by Tobey Maguire, took part in it, the special effects were as always on top, and not to say that the plot was completely bad. But it seemed to the studio that it was necessary to rethink the franchise with a new cast of performers. Mark Webb was invited to the post of director and filming of the ""New Spider-Man"" began.The image of Peter Parker, or the Spider-Man himself, was tried on by Andrew Garfield, and we meet him in high school. Peter is a very smart and quite interesting guy, he could easily be cool, but he tries not to shine and do what he likes. The hero even strikes up a friendship with the charming Gwen Stacy, but this is not exactly a romantic story. Then there will be something tougher.""The New Spider-Man"" may not be the most ideal movie, but it looks interesting and is able to make us worry about the characters and the current situation.

"It's good, but something is missing.","I'll be honest, I thought this movie would bomb. Box office, critics and bomb in my eyes as well. I was wrong. I won't say much, just the basics.Let me just start off by saying that Andrew Garfield blew me away. I didn't expect much from this guy, only ever seeing him in The Social Network, but he did his part and did it well. In Raimi's Spiderman, Peter Parker is a full on nerd. But in this particular one, he's more of a skater / just plain awkward type. But he made it work. As for Emma Stone, she was flawless. (I might be bias here, for obvious reasons.)As for the Villain, Rhys Ifans plays a magnificent Lizard. By far the best Villain of any Spider-Man movie interpretation. I always thought this was Spider-Man movies weakest point (sans Venom, he's awesome but was just portrayed and used terribly) but in TASM I loved every bit of screen time that the Lizard got.Yet, there is something missing. Something I cannot put my finger on... maybe it's just me and my mind trying to connect this and Raimi's Spider-Man and over-comparing the two, I'm not sure. One thing is for certain, and I'm sure most of you hated it too: The infamous crane scene. My word...All in all, it's a great movie too watch. Full of action, some instances of comedy, and of course, Spider-Man!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Too similar to the past,"I think I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if I had not seen the previous movies. I realize that it is going to have similar events and plot lines as Spider-man (2002)being based on the same comics, but it was a little too similar for my liking. I appreciate originality and I felt it played more as a re-make then a reboot. Even the scene in the beginning where a young man is being bullied with a food tray reminded me of the scene in the 2002 movie where Peter uses the tray to show his new skills. I thought by adding things so reminiscent of the past movie the director was almost making fun of it, and trying to show that he could do it better.I am not saying it was bad, it was a great movie. Just a little to similar a little too soon.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Very Average Superhero Film *SPOILERS*,"Alright, first of all let me make clear that im not slating the film I just found it to be a very average super-hero film.Let me set the scene, a friend of mine went to see the film a few days ago on release and said that he loved it and that it was better then the Dark Knight... Now im no idiot but just from seeing the trailer I had the sneaking suspicion it wasn't going to be as good as DK...My impressions on the film are simple and can be summed up as this: ""Its nothing spectacular, its an average film."" To clarify to those who are interested, no it doesn't even touch the dark knight in anyway, shape or form... Its a much better watch, go see it if you haven't already.My biggest problem with the film is that the entire main cast of characters are oddly connected to one another, the world in this remake of spiderman seems very small and oddly set up, the only way I can describe this is there just seems to be many coincidences within the film... for example it just so happens Parkers love interest and school mate is a lead intern with the villain of the film, its a coincidence that parkers father was directly linked to the spider weaving project (sigh) that would lead to his powers some years later - its also a coincidence that his father was head researcher and his best friend was again the villain of the film - this is simply LAZY writing and doest bring anything to the film. Oh and his love interest girlfriends dad is also the Captain in charge of finding Spiderman - That's a hell of a lot of coincidences right there...My second gripe is that there's A lot of sign-posting in this Spiderman remake... A lot. I know signposting has become the Hollywood norm and for some reason American writers and studios like to treat their audiences as complete morons who wouldn't be able to work out the simplest of plot devices even when its explained to them ten minutes before in a previous scene... Spiderman does this... Again and again. The more noticeable scene is when Parker stumbles into the lizards lair and finds a Youtube style video (sigh) explaining EXACTLY what the lizards going to do and why he's doing it... There's then a map laid out on the table with the location of the final showdown circled in red pen and labelled for good measure - REALLY? Another example would be the machine thats very obviously pointed out to us at the beginning of the film in the OSCORP labs - its purpose can be summed up as 'It's a fancy looking Mortar, nothing more, nothing less' that Parkers dad designed (sigh.) The acting and characters are again average, but the writing lets the story down, the Police Captain who's hell-bent on bringing Spiderman to justice, OK not a bad plot, a bit batman esque sure, but the funny thing is twenty of his best men just got transformed into monsters by the giant lizard destroying downtown... That doesn't concern him though and he decides to throw everything at Spiderman who's done nothing but assist and help the cops... The captain then decides it'd be a good idea to storm the OSCORP labs with just himself and Spiderman - yet he has a small army of Police and SWAT officers surrounding the building... WHY? Who would do this? You can probably guess it doesn't end well for him and it wouldn't would it? He knew who Spiderman was afterall so of COURSE the script demanded he be gotten rid.The action scenes are OK and the film is passable if you switch your brain off.In short its a 'painting by numbers' kind of film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Disappointing Spider-Man,"After the monumental train wreck that was Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3, a reboot of the Spider-Man franchise was inevitable. But who would have thought that 500 Days of Summer director, Marc Webb, would take the reins to bring our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man back to life? Well, he did, and now he's given a whole new look and feel to the franchise far more cartoonier and light hearted than Sam Raimi's trilogy. The Amazing Spider-Man is the first film in what will likely be a trilogy if not four or five films depending on the series' success.This first film is obviously the origin story of Spider-Man, explaining how Peter Parker came to be the web slinging hero. In it he faces The Lizard, aka Dr. Curt Connors, a man who worked with Peter's father at Oscorp. And that is probably the most interesting thing about the storyline of this new Spidey film. There is a lot of backstory surrounding Peter's parents in this new rendition of the hero. Not much is explained in this first film as many questions are raised and practically none are answered. It's clear something very big is being created here and there will likely be some vast interesting story about Peter's parents that will run through the entire series. For this first film this part of the story was kind of weird and felt out of place, but it's very clear that there's something much greater in the works for it. We will just have to wait and see how it develops.The backstory of Peter's parents aside, The Amazing Spider-Man certainly has it's own individual story, but one that feels very rushed and very shoddy. It just didn't feel quite right. It's obviously the story of Spider-Man and it incorporates all the right aspects of how he got his powers and how Peter Parker came to be Spider-Man. But the film just goes through all these motions of the familiar story very quickly and without much elaboration. The film was too rushed and too underdeveloped to really be a quality Spider-Man film. It's hard to adequately describe the problem at hand, but it definitely exists and there was definitely something keeping me from really enjoying this film's story.Sadly, The Amazing Spider-Man has some problems aside from its story as well. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films were very real and much grittier in comparison to this new very cartoony Spider-Man film. In some ways this is a neat effect and it certainly can work for a superhero as aloof as Spider-Man. This isn't Batman and we don't have to take it very seriously. This is the route Marc Webb went when giving this new Spider-Man film it's own distinct look and feel. I don't like it as much as the more realistic Raimi Spider-Man vision, but it serves its purpose.However, what doesn't suffice is the way this cartoony style translates to the very cheap and video game looking CGI in the film. There's a ton of CGI and none of it is that impressive. Spidey's web slinging isn't all that cool, despite Webb's awesome camera work that he employs to make parts of this film quite the visual spectacle. But the graphics of this film just aren't up to speed with today's CGI capabilities. It all looks too smooth and too silly to make this film awesome. Even the film's main villain, the menacing Lizard, isn't that cool. The body of the creature is neat and his rampaging around New York is admittedly pretty awesome, but his face is what ruins it for me. It's a poorly designed creature that, sadly, had a lot of potential. The same can be said for the whole film. It had lots of potential, but poor design made the film fall short.I won't say that this new Spider-Man film is a disaster, but it's not great. Some of its flaws are true flaws, like the design of the Lizard and the unimpressive CGI, and some of it just a matter of personal opinion, like the silly and cartoonish look of the film. But, overall, The Amazing Spider-Man just isn't that great. Andrew Garfield is great as the new Peter Parker, Emma Stone is awesome as Gwen Stacey, Rhys Ifans is very cool as Curt Connors, and Martin Sheen makes a great Uncle Ben. But as far as the screenplay is concerned this film definitely falls short. The story doesn't flow right and the look of the film is nothing impressive. Any comic book film fan should see this film, but set your expectations low.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I love spiderman,There's something about this movie the more I watch it. I like the darker tone to this movie. I love Andrew and Emma's relarionship. The best of them . When I watched it the first time I didn't think it was the best. But I think it rivals the original spiderman movies. It's not better than 1 and 2 but it's a good movie. I think it helps ive grown up with the movies and not the comics so I dont have any expectations except to go off of tobeys movies and the 90s cartoon series. Also my opinion has the best uncle Ben and aunt may of the series too.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another Great Spidey!,"When I first saw this movie I wasn't sure how I felt, as the story developed and went on with time I started to love this movie!Andrew Garfield was an amazing Spider-Man, this movie is a great watch, whether you're a spidey fan or not this is a very entertaining movie to watch.Highly recommend!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Quite Close To Amazing!,"Well So After Some Expectation of this and getting mixed reviews about it, I finally watched The Amazing Spiderman today and here's what I Thought about it. Entertaining, Well Acted and Smartly Directed with Good action and Very good Visual Effects, along with a dazzling Emma Stone and a Cool Spidey, this movie is bound to entertain audience and its a very good start to this new reboot of the series, and it has everything in it starting from Action to Acting to Visual Effects and Storyline which is mostly due to the hard work of Director Mark Webb and also due to great efforts from the leading actors.The Story of this movie is probably known by any comic book/superhero fan but this is a whole new start to the Spiderman franchise and the film-makers have made quite a few drastic but effective changes in this movie which can make it better than its previous one. So it again shows how Peter Parker(Now played by Andrew Garfield) becomes Spider-man and also develop a crush for Gwen Stacy(Emma Stone) along with showing us some of his cool moves and also defeating the dangerous Lizard/Curt Connors( Rhys Ifans) in the way to save New York City.The Acting by the leading actors are quite effectively good and the new Spidey aka Andrew Garfield has done a marvelous job in portraying Spider-man, And i personally love this Spider-Man more than Toby's Spiderman. Garfield has played this Super-hero very cool-ly and has done his everything to entertain audience right from when he becomes Spider- man and I think He's surely gonna become a fan-favourite for this. Emma Stone was Dazzling as Gwen Stacy and played the love-life of Peter Parker Brilliantly with her charismatic and good acting and she surely does justice to this character and I really loved her in this role. Rhys Ifans is quite a brilliant actor and he again does very well in this movie as Curt Connors/Lizard and he does both the positive and negative part of this character brilliantly.Director Mark Webb who incidentally himself has the title ''Webb'' has done an excellent job with the start of this new series and has set the right tone for this new super-hero franchise. He Did Brilliantly with all aspects of this film starting from Acting to Visual Effects also convincingly telling the story to the audience and the movie always has some entertainment in it so that it does'nt bore the audience. He has made a really good super-hero film and not those drab only action one's. Well Done to him and I expect good things from him in the future.The Visual Effects of this movie is'nt as good as The Avengers but its still very good and the effects of Spidey Flying around and jumping through the streets of New York city sometimes are really fascinating and really breathtaking at times, so I guess the Visual effects team deserve some credits for putting all their hard-work into this movie. I Thought the Editing was a bit bad and some parts of the movie would have been better not showed.The Story of this movie has a all new kind of a tone to it than the Last Spider-Man and this also has some new characters to it and that makes it more interesting, and this story of Spiderman vs Lizard was shown on the screen quite well by the director and I hope that the next part will be better if not as good as this.This is not exactly ''Amazing'' buts its quite close to it, And with the cool Garfield as Spider-Man and A Good Villain along with the dazzling Emma Stone, this one will definitely entertain all kind of movie lovers and specially comic books fan should also go for this one, Because i liked it very much.My Rating: 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A new Spider-Man for a new generation,"A new Spider-Man for a new generation. This Peter Parker is a much more contemporary outcast, full of angst. No longer a bookish science nerd, Pete's a skateboard-riding introvert. And like all high school kids, he's got issues he's struggling with. Growing pains, personal stuff. He's moody, he's rebellious. This Peter Parker is meant to appeal to today's youth. He could be a friend or a classmate or a neighbor. He is a stand-in for every teenager who teethed on cell phones and grew up on the Internet.Personally, I feel just a little too old for this interpretation, but the update probably keeps the character fresh for modern audiences. Sam Raimi's films are more traditional adaptations of the comics, while this is a cinematic re-imagining of the source material. The familiar ingredients are there (Uncle Ben, Aunt May, genetically-engineered spiders), it's just a matter of how they're used. Your miles may vary, but I wasn't quite in sync with director Marc Webb, although I could see what he was going for. The best thing about this movie is Emma Stone. The Lizard looks lame and some of the special effects look too fake. And the story isn't particularly gripping. But maybe I'm just too old.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just above average spider man,"You would think someone named Mark Webb would be a shoe in to direct a movie version of Spider man with that name. You would also think a movie entitled the amazing spider man would be in in fact an amazing take on the material. On both of these accounts you'd be wrong. Not to say the film doesn't have moments and is generally entertaining but for the most part it's kind of a mess. This time around the take on Peter Parker is a more realistic one. He's a little annoying, a little selfish, a lot more sarcastic so your normal teenager. The events in the film transpire accordingly with the bite of the spider and the death of his parents and than Uncle. But the film unravels in an interesting way making the material seem fresh and mostly unvisited. What the film gets wrong mostly lies in it's direction. Despite a few stabs at the darker side of things this seems like spidey light. It's very comical, with lots of jokes and a sort of disneyish generic atmosphere. Which is all fine and dandy but the film just doesn't mesh well. It moves sloppily back and forth beneath genres and subplots without building a realistic engagement to the events depicted. The good lies in the films interesting and inspired casting choices Andrew Garfield is geekyily gorgeous in the lead and although his character is somewhat angsty he manages to make him likable and is truly gifted at being emotionally resonant. Emma Stone is cute but unnecessary as his love interest and even though the 2 share winning chemistry their relationship isn't allowed time to develop appropriately and seems a little forced. Sally Field also adds some solid support as Aunt May. The film sports nice special effects but the 3D is just so so. A better take on the material would have been a darker one such as as the dark knight is to Batman franchise. I do think they made the right decision in rebooting the material as the last installment in the previous franchise had worn out it's welcome. As Spider Man films go this one falls into being the second best. However, it should be noted that although I enjoyed the original film immensely I wasn't a big fan of the others. There's a lot to enjoy here and I would welcome another installment but I do hope Marc Webb is not a part of it as well as the screenwriters that penned this installment. Although a piece of passable Hollywood blockbuster entertainment the film admirably works better on it's human levels which is a great feat to accomplish. That being said the film ends up being a just above average spider man than an amazing one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An all round brilliant spidey film,"Once I heard about all of the cast of the old Spiderman films being wiped out and new people coming in, I wasn't at all happy, but after waiting for the trailer to be released and some story plots, I was actually looking forward to the upcoming film. I had finally had time to watch the film in my local cinema, and was very excited. And no doubt I should of been. One of the most favorite films of all time. Brilliant start middle and finish , even without MJ, Gwen Stacy was just as good, Peter tells her half way through the film, so i believe a more love connection between the two characters.

"Three strikes and out, and now yet another fumbled swing","They said it was going to be a 'Batman Begins' style reboot of a franchise that had been destroyed by studio interference. It was a promise they did not deliver.The Amazing Spider-Man is well below Batman Begins when it comes to aesthetic, direction, writing, sound design, cinematography, music, and editing. In fact, I reckon that the three men who cut this film together be ejected from Hollywood. It was, by far, the most poorly edited film I have seen in a long time. It boggles the mind that Pietro Scalia has two Oscars. The fight in the subway was incomprehensible to me. Peter Parker is stuck on a girl's blouse and the next moment there are a bunch of unconscious people on the floor. What happened? And puh-lease stop using 'stutter cuts', they are getting really old and annoying.John Schwartzman, who made The Rock and Armageddon look so good, gives us a fairly bland color pallet. Too afraid to be dark, and too smart to revert to Raimi's ostentatious style. It exists somewhere in between, with all the visual appeal of a TV movie. Though this might be in part due to the fact that I saw the 2D version. The effort here is phoned-in. If anything Sony have given Spider-Man a 'Batman Forever' makeover. There's so much disappointment in this new incarnation of Spidey, but it's still an improvement over Sam Raimi's garish, cartoony trilogy.Newcomer Andrew Garfield is the teenage Peter Parker (despite being 27 at the time of filming) who is bitten by an experimental spider at Oscorp, where he has detoured from an intern open day. As we've seen before, the bite gives him super powers. As we've seen before, he uses them to get his own back on Flash Thompson. As we've seen before, Uncle Ben dies before Peter learns to use his powers for good instead of indulgence.So far, so familiar. The one thing so many superhero origin movies suffer from is the fact that once the new powers have been established the subsequent plot of the rest of the film feels like a half-assed afterthought. Amazing Spider-Man does a slightly better job of tying the main story to Peter Parker's history, but it's completely ineffectual. Such a shame as the Lizard had the potential to be a memorable, tragic villain and yet he only comes across as a token bad guy carrying the burden of the worst motivations I've seen in a mainstream movie. The Oscorp plot is virtually unintelligible and has convenient contrivances that would make even the cheapest screenwriter groan. And that evil Asian guy was a poor character, poorly acted. I was amazed at how many completely blank expressions he was capable of. One of the three writers should have written him out completely.I'm not one of these snobs who says that there is no place for CGI in movies. I ain't the biggest fan of CGI, but when it's done gracefully, and with restraint, it can be pleasingly deceiving. What a filmmaker should never, ever do is blend the photography with CGI. It's a mistake, it looks tawdry, and it robs any film of any kind of class it might otherwise achieve. I know I am not the only one who is sick to death of 'impossible camera' (a trend made popular by Rob Cohen in The Fast and the Furious with those 'ignition to tailpipe' shots). I wanted the Amazing Spider-Man to take my breath away but I only ever gasped once, during Spidey's rescue of the kid in the burning car. At least the web slinging and swinging feels and looks better. There's G-Force and gravity to Spidey throwing himself into the wide-open spaces between New York's city blocks. But this is undone by bad editing. I can't tell where the real stunts end and the CGI begins, meaning the both efforts undermine each other.Andrew Garfield is a huge improvement on Tobey Maguire, and Emma Stone was easily likable and a world away from her bitchy Zombieland persona. Plus it also stars Denis Leary, who I would pay good money to see reading Dr. Seuss. Sally Field and Martin Sheen offer good support too, though there's nothing for them to really get into.Amazing Spider-Man tries to cram in too much, and virtually every aspect is neutered as the film charges from one scene to the next without letting anything develop organically. I'm not sure that Marc Webb, fitting surname or not, was the best choice to direct. After the gaudy excess of Raimi's unjustifiably popular trilogy this superhero really needed a bite of the cold, real world and a strong director calling the shots.Maybe next time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spiderman has kept up it's name-Amazing,"I enjoyed this film and I prefer it to the old film. Ryhs Ifans is really good as the villain and I cannot believe it is the same man who played the idiot 'Spike' in Notting Hill. Andrew Garfield is great in the role as Peter Parker/Spiderman. He adds humor to the role with sarcasm unlike Tobey Maguire's serious version as Spiderman. The actors are good, the action takes awhile to come but is at the level of a Superhero film, and the 3D is average until the fight scenes where you can go, ""Oh, yeah I forgot it was in 3D."" Nice to see the return of the web-shooters instead of just using his hands. This shows Parker's inventive side, I never you it existed in the other films. His parents have gone missing, something I brushed over in the old film but in this film it suggests that Parker came from a family of 'extra-ordinary' people. Nice to see that Aunt May doesn't look like a frail grandma who you expect is going to die any minute like the old film. But enough criticising the old film, this one is very different to the other one. it doesn't feel like a normal superhero film, and is up there with Avengers.

I am not going to see the sequel cause I do not like Danny in CSI NY: a fake new yorker if ever there was one. If you look at Peter's face and the eyebrows ugh just the same. puke. Also Peter doesn't have the joy of the old Peter. Wouldn't you revel in being able to swing back and forth amongst the buildings of Manhattan????and the worst is the the ghastly Sally Field, Who is responsible for her hair and her attitude? Kill that person. Kill that person right now! Martin sheen also over reacted but his presence was a nice touch. Someone stupid is in charge of this movie. Who told Sally Field to act that way? The best things about the movie is Peter has a nice love interest not like that dog of yesteryear... and...the bad guy is interesting and I fear there is another bad guy waiting behind these characters. and the ideas are pretty good. just someone in charge of the small things has to go...and get rid of the Danny-ideation of Peter.

"Nothing amazing in The Amazing Spider-Man, blame it on the script","Mr. Director ! You are such a noob and you have proved it very well. Who in the world would make a movie with such ludicrous script? When you are creating a movie, a Super-hero movie, then you should very well keep in mind that there are others as Iron Man, Bat Man and The Avengers against whom you have to stand. Every thing needs to be fantabulous. No flaws. And this is what you came up with.The most distinguishing difference between Sam Raimi, the director of earlier Spider-man movies and Marc Webb, director of the new one is that the later one is fresh out of college of direction and has a lot to areas to work upon. Sam Raimi has proved a lot by offering a wide range of genre of cinema. And that's exactly why a monstrous challenge for Webb grew up. The Amazing Spider-Man was a great onus that was put on, let's say, an immature shoulders of Webb and there's where everything falters. In the world where we have Nolan and Joss Whedon, this guy did not find a perfect spot even to stand up.Let's talk about the movie. All characters played there parts very well. A great justice to all the characters has been done. No one could be a better choice than Garfield for the lead role. Garfield is intense, smart and a genuine charm he carries with himself. Simply flawless. He brings a perfectionist's touch to the Spider-man's character. The girl, Emma Stone, has done an outstanding work. I have always adored her. I was never fond of Mary Jane who would always cry and carry a rather shabby personality. The then Peter-Jane love story was all just stupid. Here is a brand new genial love story with a girl you'd always dream of. She is smart, sassy and a perfect fit for Mr. Parker. Other characters - Parker's uncle, his aunt, the doctor and the girl's father, everyone did well.The direction was not that great and the poor script extinguished all the fire the director thought of putting in the movie. The movie were meant to be grand one considering its superb characterization and some breath-taking effects but the script ruined it all. The expectations from this movie were bit higher. Spider-man 4 was scrapped because Raimi could not find a great plot. Five years' wait and we thought we would get some great kicks but sadly nothing much was dished out.Watch the movie for the effects and the fresh new characters.

Was this really a necessary movie?,"I saw this movie despite not being an overly keen fan of superheroes or spiderman in particular. Why? Well because I had the time and had nothing else to see.Having seen it, I must say that I sit here wondering just why they had to go and start the spiderman movies all over from the scratch? That just made no particular sense to me. Wasn't the other movies good enough? I can only speculate and guess, and it wouldn't get anywhere. I can just say that I think that this movie was somewhat of an unnecessary movie in many ways. Sure it was a good movie, fun and entertaining, but it is not something that was vital to cinema to have it remade and reinvented.Visually, then ""The Amazing Spiderman"" is quite a treat. It is nicely made and looks good. But as with the previous movies, I just wonder with all that webbing he shoots about him as he swings through the streets of New York, wouldn't the city eventually become a tangled mess with all those strands of web? Or is the web somehow magically degradable by itself, yet strong enough to support hanging cars from a bridge? It just doesn't really add up.Story-wise, well there were some deviants from the storyline in the first movie, and I guess that is the major difference between ""Spiderman"" and ""Amazing Spiderman"", but then again, I am not familiar with the story lines in the original comic books series, so I am just guessing. But again, it just adds to the point that this movie wasn't really a necessary movie to have made, in my opinion.The movie bolstered some great names to the cast; such as Martin Sheen, Sally Field, Denis Leary and Emma Stone. I am not familiar with Andrew Garfield's work prior to this movie, but he did a good enough job with his role as Peter Parker/Spiderman.I am sure for die-hard fans of the Spiderman franchise, then ""The Amazing Spiderman"" is a super great movie.

He also was able to make the character relatable and cause some really good moments. I do enjoy the Gwen Stacy approach instead of MJ that was cool to switch it up from most other spidermen. The lore stay pretty accurate but was able to make it its own which I enjoy! I whatever first super hero movie does is make the villain someone who is meant to be the same as the hero but different and that's great and all but normally causes the powers to be very samey but with this approach they got that but were able to still keep them very different so it wasn't just two people who can do the same thing going at it. I feel like Gwen and Peter's relationship was very realistic like a lot of this movie felt real which weirdly got to me so I think it was a good time all around.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Adult Spider-Man,"The first thing I want to say and get out of the way is that I don't get the hate on this movie from other people who saw it, when I really liked this version of Spider-Man.I thought Andrew Garfield as an adult Peter Parker/Spider-Man was really good, his Spider-Man was funny at scenes and he was accurate to the Spider-Man from the comics.I loved that he made his own Web Shooters instead of his webs just coming out of his wrists like in the Sam Raimi Spider-man trilogy.I liked Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy and found her and Peter's relationship believable and wanting to see more, also she actually helps and fights back in some scenes instead of just needing to saved 24/7.The Spider-Man suit looks ok but I won't complain about it because I know they were trying something different with it. The action scenes are fun and quick along with a great Stan Lee cameo.The actors for Uncle Ben and Aunt May were pretty good and there was more tension/drama between Peter and Uncle Ben, also the web slinging look really well done and looks real.The Lizard was ok and the design was ok but the look of him could be different, but it doesn't bother me that much.I know there are some minor problems but I still really liked this because this is my kind of Spider-Man.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent Superhero film.,I am not a fan of super hero movies and watched this only because my kids wanted to watch it.The cast was top rate. I thought Andrew Garfield was pretty impressive as Peter Parker and made a better Spider-man than Tobey Maguire. Emma Stone is a fantastic actress and always worth watching and adds charm as Gwen Stacy. Martin Sheen was as good as ever and Rhys Ifans makes for a pretty good villain.The film was beautifully shot and the set pieces where Peter Parker discovers his powers were amusing and well filmed. The action sequences throughout the film were exciting and well executed.This is an old fashioned and uncomplicated telling of the tale and much the better for it. This to my mind is the finest Superhero film made and certainly much better than the recent Dark Knight films.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Amazing Spider-Man...2.5 out of 4 Skittles,"The Spider-Man franchise is launched again, only five years after Sam Raimi wrapped up his highly successful trilogy. After watching the latest installment it makes you wonder why.Other than the obvious reason of making more money, the latest installment brings nothing new to the table that the Raimi versions didn't. So the reboot starts up with Peter Parker in high school and Uncle Ben is still alivebig whup. The writing is cheesier and the special effects seem virtually the same.Director Marc Webb, who worked his magic in the 2009 indie hit (500) Days of Summer, missed his chance of leaving a lasting impression as Raimi did. Raimi gave us iconic scenes like a car flying through a coffee shop window in slow-mo, and the infamous upside down first kiss between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. Webb gives us a montage of Peter Parker learning more about his new Spidey powers whilst skateboarding to a Coldplay soundtrack (this is no joke), and the most awkward first kiss since Harry Potter hooked up with Ginny Weasley.The trio of big time writers, James Vanderbilt (Zodiac, The Losers), Alvin Sargent (Spider-Man 2 & 3), and Steve Kloves (All the Harry Potter movies), show that too many chefs in the kitchen can sometimes only leave a big mess. Andrew Garfield (The Social Network, Never Let Me Go) and Emma Stone (The Help, Zombieland) make a valiant attempt at bringing the lead characters to life, but the pathetic script leaves them coming off like the B-version of the chemistry put together by Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow in Iron Man. The actors also seem to be out of place in high school. Buying Garfield (28 years-old) & Stone (24) as high school kids requires a large commitment from anyone with a brain. Maybe the people who cast the original 90210 series had their hands in this one too.If you don't compare The Amazing Spider-Man to Raimi's trilogy you can probably find enough positives to enjoy it and find it somewhat entertaining. But for the most part the latest Spidey flick is just another example of Hollywood forcing out another big budget stinker that they know they can make a quick buck from. I would rather see a comic book reboot for characters that need it. Can someone please do justice for The Fantastic Four?

A disappointment to the genre,"The movie feels like they added a plot after coming up with the special effects. It checks the boxes of the expected plot points, but the acting and character development are non-existent. The movie doesn't give you a reason to care about the main characters, so you are left with just enjoying the special effects or taking a nap.Emma Stone looks nothing like Mary Jane from the comics, and doesn't have a believable character arc. She goes from not liking to loving Peter Parker for no apparent reason. I guess it had to happen for the plot to move forward, but it does not happen in a convincing manner.My advice is to watch the original movies or , even better, read the comics.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great adaptation,"First of all, i would like to say as a Spider man fan my expectations were fulfilled, not only because the actors were so well chosen, but also because the universe that Marc Webb created for this movie was well adapted from some universes of Spider-man comics. And from other reviews i read from some ""displeased"" fans, i would like to state that those people were ignorant and knew nothing about arcs that happened in the Spider man comic books. First of all the main plot was based on the ultimate series, but the ""vibe"" it self was more based on the classic series, like for an example, Gwen Stacy was Peter's first love interest instead of Mary Jane. To finalize i just would like to complement both the performance by Rhys Ifans but also the loyalty of the Lizard character to the comic book. Thank you Marc Webb.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Amazing Re-spin,"The Amazing Spider-Man: Enjoyable, albeit too familiar, action/adventure/fantasy deftly directed by Marc Webb. Darker, cooler, retread of the comic-book inspired Spider-Man origin story. Peter Parker, an awkwardly hyper-intelligent teen, dealing with abandonment issues, new-found powers (due to a radioactive spider bite) and trying to find his place in life while dealing with his feelings for Gwen Stacy, happens upon a formula (his father's), which could provide answers to the perplexed Dr. Curt Conners (his father's former colleague), and win him a place in the world of ideas. All goes terribly awry, however, when Dr. Conners begins human trials upon himself, motivated by corporate pressures, which turns him into a giant lethal lizard, with a giant reptilian complex to match.Good performances by Andrew Garfield (as a more cerebral Peter Parker/Spider-Man) and Emma Stone (as love interest Gwen Stacy), the stand out being Rhys Ifans (as Dr. Curt Conners, the most interesting character by far) - led by an artful script (James Vanderbilt & Alvin Sargent), which hones in on darker, yet more believable characterizations than Sam Rami's 2002 Spider-Man.Memorable action sequences, and excellent cinematography at times putting the viewer into Spidey P.O.V mode, which was a great touch. Yet, like left-over pasta, the film is pleasing, but misses the mark on originality.

Alright Movie but generally uncaptivating [6.8/10],"I'm sure this is some people's cup of tea, but I generally found myself uninterested in the plot throughout the runtime of this film. Scenes seem to just drag on a tad too long and the dialogue falls flat for me. Spider-Man's quips here don't raise a single laugh, and make me sick of seeing him in each scene.The Lizard's whole plan and motivation is laughable and assassinate all seriousness out of his scenes. Fight scenes just kind of feel like 2 people slapping eachother around with little weight to their attacks.This movie's boring pacing is additionally stretched out by the fixation on Peter's parents, which just feels so odd like why?It's not really bad, but just not interesting and it's genuinely hard ti think of good standout scenes from the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider-man's secret origin retold.,The Amazing Spider-Man is very clearly a labour of love. The movie carries with it the same air that the early Stan lee Steve ditko stories did. Spider-Man is a tragic hero. His story has been told and retold. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man felt like a labour of love and it was. But James Webb's seems like it's attribute and a labour of love. He's not in awe of spider-man as Raimi is. Webb writes the movie like a updated version of the character as he was written in the 60's. Peter Parker is a sad sack. He's a nerd and yet he's a smart ass He knows what's right and what's wrong. He makes mistakes and yet he's not afraid to stand up for what's right.Webb's story is familiar and different and remarkably fresh.Peter Parker's parent's are scared of something and leave Peter with his aunt May and Uncle Ben. when the Parker's die in a plane crash Peter is raised by his aunt and uncle. but he has questions. when Peter becomes 16 he finds a briefcase belonging to his dad. inside he finds papers relating to his dad's research into genetic splicing. His father's old partner Curtis Connors is still alive and working for Oscorp. His uncle figures out something is wrong. Peter tries to keep this away from them. When he goes to Oscorp to meet Connors he meets his classmate Gwen Stacy. Gwen is a intern at Oscorp and she arranges a meeting with Connors. the meeting with Connors leaves more questions then answers. When Peter goes into a secured room with genetic spliced spiders he is bitten. Peter changes and develops spider like powers he decides to use the powers to show off. this has tragic consequences when Peter lets a criminal go. Peter's Uncle sees the man fleeing and tries to stop him only to be shot. When his uncle dies Peter realizes what his uncle had been trying to tell him all along. with great power comes great responsibility. He creates the uniform and the persona of spider-man and goes out looking for the man who shot his uncle.Peter protects the people of the city as best as he can. during all this he gives Connors his father's research and Connors completes his research. Connors uses it to regrow his lost arm only something goes wrong and he becomes the lizard. Peter's budding romance with Gwen takes a strange turn when her father police captain George Stacy decides to arrest the vigilante known as spider-man. meanwhile the lizard launches a attack against mankind which forces captain Stacy and spider-man into a partnership to stop him.The action is crisp and fast. the acting is spot on. the Dark Knight Rises was the better movie of the two. but this one has enough heart to hold it's own against Batman and the Avengers.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Bit Too Familiar, Spider-Man's Relaunch Struggles to Differentiate Itself","I appreciate this franchise's need to distance itself from the missteps of Spider-Man 3, to start from scratch with a villain besides the Green Goblin, and to get back to the character's roots as an awkward kid in an adult's costume, wise-cracking to mask his uncertainty. I even like the decision go completely Mary Jane-free, as I felt the old ""girl next door is the only one for me"" story was a path the Raimi films walked far too quickly. Despite those perfectly noble, admirable intentions, though, this reboot just doesn't click for me. In the ten years since the first Spider-Man, the landscape of cinematic superheroics has changed dramatically. The Avengers family has upped the action ante, while Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy has proved a hero's story can be about more than just the mask. With the glut of action heroes now on the scene, Peter Parker needed this chance to differentiate himself, but instead he fades further into the wallpaper. Andrew Garfield turns in a laudable effort, but his renditions of Parker and Spider-Man are written to be so drastically different, it's often tough to imagine they're actually the same person. I had a hard time watching Peter doom and gloom over his Uncle while at school, then immediately toss out wacky jokes at night, in the midst of hunting his killer. Martin Sheen is the film's only real standout as poor, ill-fated Uncle Ben, but that's a role so inherently sympathetic that it would take an unmitigated disaster to screw up. All things considered it's certainly not a bad effort; the cast is loyal to the source while still seeming contemporary, the action scenes are breathtaking (if surprisingly infrequent) and enough leftovers remain on the table to feed several sequels. But several dull spots, a foil that seems too run-of-the-mill and universally inconsistent characterization stop it from being as amazing as the title would have us believe.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Spidey of my childhood,"The other movies are OK. They stick to the original storyline and the acting was fine - it involved quite a few of my favourite actors. But for me, the movies lacked the engagement I had with the comics as a kid when Spiderman was my favourite superhero. Therefore I got bored to the point that I didn't even bother watching the third film. I am pleased to report that for me this is the Spiderman from the comics come to life on the big screen. Andrew Garfield plays the geeky, hopeless, clumsy hero who even though he has amazing powers, is still a nerd at heart. I did prefer Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin but I do love Rhys Ifans who does a great job. The storyline he is attached to is modern and relevant. Martin Sheen is always a pleasure to watch and I shed real tears when he inevitably dies. I had been put off by the last movies but this was much better than I expected. The only thing that puts me off is that Garfield looks so much like tennis player Andy Murray it's weird to see him smile...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Amazing Spider-Man,"Watched a 2D version in the cinema, and now the aftertaste is quite irony since the redux deliberately put an ""amazing"" in its title, the storyline basically sticks together with Sam Reimi's first instalment, parents left him, grew up with uncle and auntie, bitten by the spider, uncle died, a mad scientist with a genetic mutation, blah blah blah (and finally, save the world and lose the girl).Bully scenes are as stale as anyone could imagine, and what makes me sick is the blatant boosting of worship of ""the strongest the best"" principle (e.g. Flash's inferior stance of friendship after being humiliated by Peter Park's basketball antics), if this is the canon Hollywood mainstream products consistently not only inculcate Americans' minds, but also export to elsewhere, for which the dictatorial tone really should come under the lash. Competitiveness is beneficial in certain amount, but it is not the most chief way to gain success and fame, period!The biggest feat of this reboot is that they find a rather right couple to enliven the tedious plot, Garfield and Stone both have captivating charisma even though they all have long passed the high-schooler's age, and they are plainly adorable on screen, they can hone up all the hoarse dialogues to a much pleasant tier which one can properly endure with a blithe smile. The villain, Rhys Ifans does make an impact, but hurdled by the role's curbed dimension, barely could be claimed memorable. Let me skip Sheen & Field pair thereafter.About the CGI visual stunts, I remembered the teasing trailer did impress me with its close-up intimacy with all the spider-jumping and swinging, but in the film, luckily the night-time environment has an edgy to the spider-man dangling among the concrete jungle. even without 3D glasses, the vertiginous effect is pretty intimidating, but cannot be completely satisfied.Director Marc Webb, from (500) DAYS OF SUMMER (2009, an 8/10) proves to be no more than a qualified hacker, no superimposition shots this time. Anyway it's typical Hollywood prerogative, we detest it while being ensnared to its resource cornucopia, a dilemma which we have to ruefully swallow.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
You'll Frown!  You'll Cry!  You'll Kiss 10 Bucks Goodbye!,"Rating this movie comes down to a value judgment. If you are an aficionado of the silver age comic books, it may leave you wanting. Significant liberties were taken with the characters and their story lines to create a Spider-Man that today's kids may relate to more, as well as to improve the believability overall. Is Andrew Garfield the Peter Parker we grew up with? Hardly. But he's a Peter Parker that makes sense in 2012. The original Peter Parker was better played by Toby Maguire--straight-edge to the point of sickening, always worrying about his Aunt May getting upset. This Peter Parker, like a typical teen, wants as little to do with ""'rent"" figures as possible. Gwen Stacy has been updated as well; her demeanor is more like that of a 30-year-old than a teen in the beginning, then she deteriorates into a love object straight out of any teen exploitation television series. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are good choices for their roles, but again, you need to be ready for major storyline alterations. It is as if the writer and director went out of their ways to change things for the sake of changing them.My chief complaint about the movie is the CGI. CGI is like makeup on a woman: it should only be used by someone who knows what they are doing, and usually less is more. As many years as Hollywood has been using it, very little progress has been made in making organic things look realistic; the technology so far lends itself much better to machinery and starships than to living things. The Lizard looks like a setback to the original Shrek animation--clumsy and cartoonish. Even the Geico gecko is more convincing. Hopefully in my lifetime, they will perfect the movement techniques to the point where most CGI looks real and not like a FPS game.To be fair, if they were going to reboot a franchise, they couldn't just repackage old ideas. The movie is watchable, regardless of your background. But a sequel to it probably wouldn't be. I shudder to think what this crew would do to the Green Goblin.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I expected more action.....,"I went into the cinema hall with great expectations with the latest Spiderman. Not really a huge comic book fan, but from time to time, I have been keeping up to date with the various teaser trailers, and know enough to keep me wanting to see it.I did, and, to be honest, I was slightly disappointed by the lack of action. Don't get me wrong. By itself, this movie is great, visually, as well as story-wise. However, with the last Spiderman done just 5 years ago, one can't help but make comparisons between this movie and its predecessors. And this is where the movie falls short. I expected really more bone crunching action from this Spiderman. After all, the villain is another wall crawler with amazing powers of recovery, ie, he can't be hurt! Rather than having an intense action sequence, the director chose to have action interspersed throughout the movie in bits.But, despite my little gripe, this is a spectacular movie. The star of the show is Rhys Ifans, who gave a 101% performance, balancing between the rational and the maniacal.

A Blast of a Film,"For the context of this review I have not seen the comics and watch Sam Raimi trilogy right before this one. And honestly I enjoyed these a lot more as a fun superhero movie.I think what this film does really well is visuals and its main characters (Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy). The action in this movie is top notch and all the fight scenes where a ton of fun and made full use of the Peter Parkers powers. What also helped the fights is the this rendition of Spider-Man is a lot of fun with all the quips one liners combined with the already stunning visuals makes for a great time. And for the cherry on top Gwen Stacy is a great character she feels like an actual person with real dreams outside of her relationship with Peter and especially watching this after suffering through Peter and MJ in the Sam Raimi trilogy was a great relief.Though this movie is not without its flaws, specifically its villain which is kind of stereotypical mad scientist. Another side not is I don't know a lot of biology but even for a Spider-Man movie there are a few scenes where they use bio-engineering that just lost me. However its also a superhero movie so suspending logic is pretty necessary.Overall this movie is just a lot of fun and sometimes that is all a movie needs to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Amazing Spider-Meh,"Upon first release I really enjoyed the movie, looking back I don't really like it as much. First of Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone deliver the best performances in the film, Garfield has a love for the character and he and Stone's chemistry is wonderful. The action is also very well done, with cool swinging and fighting visual effects. Martin Sheen and Sally Field also make turn in great performances as Aunt May and Uncle Ben, so what's bad about it. Well the film has a strange Dark tone, of all comic-book superheroes Spider-Man is definitely not a hero who needs a dark tone movie, I know some comics have these great dark storylines, but it just doesn't feel right to me. The story is also just a retelling of the same one we got back in 2002, which isn't terrible it just doesn't add much new. Batman Begins and even Man Of Steel added much new elements and they were also reboots, so it makes me wonder why re-tell it. The Lizard is also one of my favorite Spider-Man villains, I've wanted to see him in a film for a long time, and while Rhys Ifans performance isn't bad, it's just very forgettable and quite bland, the lizard effects also look very computerized and it takes me out of the film sometimes, and finally the fight scenes, while actually really good, are in the worst settings. Sure the bridge scene is awesome, but the night-sewer fight and the big climactic battle, just don't feel as good as they could've been, and like I've said before setting all of the fights at night look very off putting. I don't mind some night fights, but there are literally no action scenes with Spider-Man during the day. All in all the film is fine, and if you like it that's okay, but for me personally, I prefer The Rami Trilogy and The MCU.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A reboot too soon but still good,"This review may seem a little paradoxical, but basically, here's the gist for me: the first half was messy, the second half was rushed, and it did not significantly add or achieve anything over and above Sam Raimi's original movie to necessarily warrant a full reboot like this. That being said, the whole thing kind of came together in a way that was fun, and decent overall. As a whole, I liked the movie in and of itself, but it left a whole lot to be desired.First, the overall plot and pacing. The first half, as I've already set, is just a mess. It is a mish-mash of scenes trying to establish the angst and character of Peter Parker while trying to lay some backstory suggesting a conspiracy involving Peter's parents. The problem with the conspiracy backstory is that it was never really fleshed out, and just seemed to be something tossed in to try to add some intrigue to the movie. Considering Dr. Connors' background with Richard Parker, I am surprised there wasn't a whole lot more of Peter trying to learn about his dad from him. I would have expected more bonding between them, or something, so it just didn't feel real to me.Many of the scenes in that first half of the film are just alternative takes on similar scenes in Sam Raimi's original Spider-Man film. We've got to have the shots of Flash picking on Peter, we've got to have the big argument with Uncle Ben to set up the big guilt trip later, we've got to have the Oscorp lab with the creepy experiments, the cute girl that is interested in Peter even though he's a dork, etc., etc. The scenes that were truly original to this version mostly dealt with a little prologue showing the Parkers, which seemed like it was setting up a payoff later in the film, which, sadly, never materialized.Then, after limping along for an hour, it was if the filmmakers decided to change gears, and we get about ten minutes of transition time where EVERYTHING seemingly happens all at once: the spiderbite, the costume, the webbing, the murder of you-know-who, the guilt trip, etc. - In particular, the webbing and the costume kind of came out of nowhere. One minute, nothing, the next second, he's full blown Spider-Man, and it felt very rushed.Then, the second half was a rehash of the trite old plot line - ""Hey, I'll experiment on myself. Hey, I'm a monster now!"" Because the movie limped along for that first hour, the second hour has a lot of ground to cover, in order to establish the Lizard as a baddie, and consequently it felt very rushed. Three separate battles with the Lizard, with only mere minutes of screen time between each one, setting up the next battle, kind of became tedious for me.The acting was good. All of the cast members did their jobs very well. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, as Peter and Gwen, really clicked on screen. Martin Sheen did a good job as Uncle Ben, but I really wish that relationship would have been developed a little more. As it was, I never really felt any fondness or closeness between Peter and Uncle Ben, as they were always bickering with each other. Raimi did a much better job with that relationship in the first Spider-Man movie.The action sequences were really cool. Although, by now, all these big budget action sequences are becoming the same. If you don't mind watching two CGI characters have CGI battles, it's fun. The web swinging sequences were effectively rendered too.So, overall, I would say, fun movie, though it didn't contribute meaningfully enough to the lore to warrant the reboot. We saw all of this just a few years ago when Raimi released the first ""Spider-Man."" And since the trend now seems to be to make three movies and reboot, I'm sure we'll be getting a new origin story in just a few years. After all, look no further than the fact that they're already rebooting Batman again. That's the SECOND reboot in just the past handful of years. It's starting to become a bit tedious, you know.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Mess, but has a lot of heart","The huge problem that this film carries is the character of doctor connors. The acting is great, It captures the essence of the character greatly, until the point where he turns into the lizard. He looks goofy, and is not Intimidating enough. He has a very little screen presence, there is no scale to show how huge of a danger he is.But the worst thing by far, is his motivation to turn the whole city into lizards. The main idea is great, he wants the human body to be as optimized as possible, but that idea is explored so shallow and almost laughable in his execution. Couldn't he just rather want to experiment with DNA's of living beings? And Peter doesn't want that to slip? He could've wanted to use gwen and we would've had great conflict between Peter and Connors. It sure isn't that great of an idea either, but it's better and less of an joke.Otherwise, damn great atmosphere. I loved the whole setting since I was child. Soundtrack undermines the whole picture epic. The whole story of Peter, wanting so solve the mystery of his parents, is something fresh and new that I appreciate a lot.But the real deal is his relationship to Gwen. The heart of the film. It Genuinely feels like a real relationship, it isn't over-dramatized, it just feels realistic. This is one of the best on-screen relationships I've seen.

While the visuals are good, they fail to make you excited anytime.PROS:The superhero in this looked more authentic then the other versions of the character.

If a boy is scared of him in the mask, he will take it out and show him that he is just a normal guy. Andrew Garfield looked better in the costume than Tobey Maguire. Also there is a very little difference when you see them without costume. If we consider the first films of both of them, than in his first film Tobey Maguire looked more better because of his more innocent look. But I bet in the sequels to follow, Andrew will be the best. The hero actually never had to behave heroically in this first part and that was the beauty. His sacrificing capabilities will surely show up later.CONS:The screenplay however failed a lot of times. It could not give the proper explanation of his new webbing techniques. The struggle of peter with his new powers was lacking. The chemistry between Gwen and Peter lacked the charm that was present in Mary Jane and Peter. The stunts were good but they completely lacked the emotion and story to back them up. There was no excitement even in the end.VERDICT: ""Watch at your own risk.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than it has any right to be.,"This movie is undeniably enjoyable to watch, even if it's unclear why. This is pretty crazy, all things considered. After all, it doesn't have the entirety of the MCU to fall back on that the current iteration of Spidey has, and it doesn't have the benefit the Sam Raimi films had of being made before the complete oversaturation of superhero films took over.Maybe it's that need to stand for itself that makes it what it is. Either way, it's impressive. Unfortunately it also makes its follow-up, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (also directed by Marc Webb), even more disappointing as the worst big-budget Spidey movie ever made. Yes, I said it, even worse than Spider-Man 3. Controversial, I know.It's impossible to not compare this iteration to the Raimi films that came before it, but for the most part every comparison I find has a ""it's different but it works"" response. Easy example would be the musical score. I'd be lying to say that I don't prefer Danny Elfman's Spidey score and consider it the definitive theme for the character, but the work James Horner has done on this film works amazingly for what it is.It is, of course, not a perfect film. Not by any means. There's some pretty basic leaps of logic and a general lack of reaction at play here. I mean, a high school kid solves a problem that a group of scientists have spent over a decade trying to solve and no one, not even the head scientist and antagonist in the making, really thinks twice about it? The biggest sin of the movie sounds pretty dumb as soon as you say it out loud but nonetheless is something I believe to be true: The screenwriters made Peter too cool.The character of Peter Parker in every iteration so far, including this one, is a bit of a social pariah, but in this case it's too hard to believe. I'm not saying Peter can't be cool, I'm just saying to make him super cool AND still make him this outcast makes no real sense. It breaks the belief. He's this attractive skater boy who regularly stands up against bullies, long before he has any super powers to speak of, and you're telling me this kid has no friends? I don't buy it.All that aside, this movie had so many things going against it. So many reasons why it shouldn't be good, so many audience members going into the theater already rolling their eyes at the audacity of how quickly this was rebooted. And yet, here we have a truly decent take on the character. I don't care what anyone says, that's impressive.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not the worst spider man ever..,"Honestly it's not as bad as some people make it out to be. The movie is a retelling of a story we already know, some minor flaws but no movie is perfect. In this setting Peter is a just a kid in high school you can expect things not to go as mature and smoothly so just don't compare it to the Peter Parker you know from the Sam Raimi movies. Sam Raimi's third Spiderman movie was the worst and this is nothing like that movie. What I found bothersome is how meager and unoriginal the story is. Like Spiderman only has one enemy? There are tons to choose from do something with that or ad a female super hero romance like with the Black Cat. Anyways because the story was so skinny the movie drags on too long you don't need more than 2 hours to tell this story =_=. Regardless I did enjoy the movie it's somewhat what I expected it to be, no serious high hopes but just action fun. If you're looking for a super hero, action flick and you are just in the mood for it than you should just watch it.Also I think it's silly for people to go all badd @ss online comparing this movie to Sam Raimi's work and not knowing anything about the many different Spiderman comic stories or animations. It's a movie based on a comic, a lot of comics tend to have great artwork and enjoyable simple stories only a few have the high quality stories. So be grateful for what you get everything better is extra!Ps:I must say if you haven't seen the Sam Raimi ones, shame on you XD. Go watch those first (the first and the second, I don't recommend the third).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Successful Reboot and Start of a Franchise,"Initial Review: The Sam Raimi ""Spiderman"" trilogy was hugely successful and really set the bar high for other superhero flicks, but a disappointing third installment (made in 2007) ended the franchise. Five years later, Sony released ""The Amazing Spiderman"" the first installment for the rebooted franchise. The reboot, which is the film I'm reviewing, is directed by Marc Webb and features actor, Andrew Garfield, as Peter Parker/Spiderman. I was skeptical after seeing the trailers for the film, but the actual movie changed my opinion.The Positives: The first improvement Sony made from the original trilogy is the cast. When I first saw photos of Andrew, I thought he would be a terrible choice for the role, but I now believe he is the superior Peter Parker/Spiderman. Andrew's acting ability is incredible; he is very flexible and displays emotion well without coming off as cheesy or giving the feeling that he is overacting. He plays the role of the nerdy Peter Parker well and has the cocky and joking nature of Spiderman down to a science (which was missing from the first trilogy). Every time I watch him play the role in the Amazing Spiderman 1&2, I feel like I am actually in a comic book, which adds to the authenticity of the film. Emma Stone plays the role of high school sweetheart Gwen Stacy, and displays a moving chemistry with Andrew Garfield (and I guess it helps that these two are dating in real life). ""The Amazing"" brought in new angles, like Peter's parents, which added to the storyline and brought something fresh for those who followed the last franchise. One thing that I really enjoyed about this film is the new look and web shooters for Spiderman. I really was not a fan of the organic web shooters of Raimi's trilogy, and watching peter design the web shooters was fun and added credibility to his genius qualities. The new suit was also a fresh look. The slick, spandex suit has visual appeal and the eye pieces, to me, gives Spiderman a darker tone. The comedy was awesome and kept me laughing throughout.The Negatives: The main problem I had with the movie (which to me is a big problem) is the lack of action. I'm not saying there was no action throughout the movie, but the scenes were short and didn't provide the vibe of Spidey having much power. His attacks didn't seem to cause much damage to the lizard (the villain of the movie). The second issue I had with the movie is the villain himself. Even though he had good back story, I was disappointed with the cgi used for his appearance. He just didn't feel very scary despite his massive size.The Conclusion: Despite some negative aspects, I gave the movie 7/10 which I deem as a pretty positive review. ""The Amazing Spiderman"" brings new concepts to the table which makes the film entertaining for the general audience. I am confident that this movie will be a good experience for comic book fans and general viewers. I strongly recommend this film.Also see my review for ""The Amazing Spiderman 2""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I liked it but I was disappointed,"I did enjoy this film, I at least thought it was better then the Raimi version. But it really could have been a lot better. There are certain films which you assume good CGI and the 3D will greatly enhance. Spiderman is one of them. I expected to see Spidey swing and scale the New York city scape, in glorious CGI and in 3D. I wanted to come out of the cinema with at least a fear of heights, but no, the CGI and the 3D effects are not great. The most amazing thing about ""The Amazing Spiderman"" is the question, what the hell did they spend 220 million on?. Perhaps they developed and used real Spider web instead of CGI, I don't know, does anyone else?But I am being unfair, I did enjoy the film and my 2 nephews whom I brought along are still trying to run up the walls, they absolutely loved it. I recommend it but have low expectations, it is not The Avengers in effects or 3D but still a great film to take kids to.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining but did we really need another remake already?,"I'm not sure why studios feel the need to keep rebooting these comic book superhero movies every couple of years Batman, Superman etc. The last Spiderman wasn't even that long ago -4 years- did we really need another remake already? And on that note I preferred the version with Toby Maguire (Spiderman) especially this first inception story.Anyways. This was still an entertaining movie, fun with good special effects. I enjoyed the cast; Rhys Ifans as the lizard man, Dennis Leary, Peter's parents Martin Sheen and Sally Field. Andrew Garfield was fine as Peter Parker, full of teen angst and nice to look at, but I just kept comparing him to Toby Maguire. The romance was kinda meh, it probably plays out better in real life (wink).So once again we follow high-school outcast Peter Parker as he embraces his destiny as Spiderman, investigating his late father's secrets, falling for the beautiful Gwen Stacy and in this version battling Dr. Curt Connors aka the Lizard. 9/21/14",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Swinging Back to Origins: A Fresh Take on a Legendary Superhero,"The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) is a reboot of the Spider-Man film franchise, directed by Marc Webb. It stars Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker, a high school student who gains superhuman abilities after being bitten by a genetically modified spider. As he grapples with his newfound powers, Peter investigates the mysterious disappearance of his parents and uncovers a connection to Dr. Curt Connors, a scientist at Oscorp. Dr. Connors (played by Rhys Ifans) transforms into the monstrous Lizard after experimenting on himself, and it's up to Spider-Man to stop him from wreaking havoc on New York City.The Good:Andrew Garfield's Performance: Garfield brings a fresh and energetic take on Peter Parker. His portrayal captures the character's vulnerability, wit, and determination, making him a compelling and relatable superhero.Chemistry: The on-screen chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone (who plays Gwen Stacy) is palpable and adds depth to their characters' relationship. Their interactions feel genuine and heartfelt, enhancing the emotional core of the film.Visuals and Action Sequences: The film features impressive visual effects and thrilling action sequences. The web-swinging scenes are particularly exhilarating, offering a dynamic and immersive experience for the audience.The Bad:Plot Familiarity: As a reboot, the film retreads familiar ground with Peter Parker's origin story. While it offers some new twists, it may feel repetitive for those already familiar with Spider-Man's beginnings.Villain Development: Dr. Curt Connors' transformation into the Lizard and his subsequent motivations could have been explored more deeply. The character's arc feels somewhat rushed, and his actions lack the complexity that could make him a more compelling antagonist.Pacing Issues: At times, the film's pacing can be uneven, with certain scenes dragging on while others feel rushed. This can disrupt the overall flow and make it challenging to maintain consistent engagement.Overall, The Amazing Spider-Man successfully reinvigorates the Spider-Man franchise with strong performances, engaging visuals, and emotional depth. While it may not entirely escape the shadow of its predecessors, it offers a fresh perspective on the beloved superhero and provides an enjoyable cinematic experience for both new and longtime fans.Hope you enjoyed this review!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A little hard to be impressed by a lack of re-imagination.,"I saw this with low expectations, but, like many, wanted to see what they had done differently from Sam Raimi's trilogy. I honestly believe it would have been great to see the story continued, rather than restarted and barely re-imagined. The pacing was painfully slow, and took way too much time to gain momentum with a story that was too bubble-gum pop to be taken seriously, and with about as much substance as watching an episode of Pretty Little Liars. The chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma stone was a high point, though at times Peter seemed a little too twitchy, and a little annoying when in costume. The second half of the film was much more enjoyable after being bored by the first, with some nice special effects. Unfortunately the film score, which should have complimented the screen action, lacked. I did however enjoy one of the last scenes with the blue snow and felt that the music in that scene was perfect for a great looking shot. All in all I wouldn't spend over $10 to watch this, and with the lack of action wouldn't bother with 3D but will probably watch it again when it comes out on DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Swinging With Style,"When Tobey Maguire finished filming for Spider-Man 3 back in July 2006, he probably sat back on his laurels and smiled, safe in the knowledge that his immediate future in the world of superhero films was safe. So imagine his shock when Marvel Studios announced at the start of 2010 that, as opposed to continuing the series where they had left off, they were preparing to reboot the entire franchise.And reboot it they have. Their latest effort, The Amazing Spider-Man, manages to be everything its predecessors weren't. It's effortlessly funny, brilliantly scripted, commendably acted, and much, much closer to the comics. Andrew Garfield is fantastic as the lead, mixing cheeky teen and pressured adult with ease. You can drop right into his world, allowing a real sense that the citizen-saving hero is often just as vulnerable and scared as those he's trying to rescue.The biggest difference between the revamp and the originals lies in the plot. Whilst the 2002 adaptation swaps introductory depth for high- octane action, this version revels in the specifics. The first hour is completely taken up with a detailed look at exactly how this scruffy, skateboarding orphan becomes the string-spinning neighbourhood hero we all know and love. Written down it looks long-winded and dull, but director Marc Webb (clearly fate has a sense of humour) manages to pull it off to perfection, building believable relationships gradually and dotting the script with tension and secrets.The scene when we find out something has happened to Peter is a particular highlight. Peter is repeatedly forced to object and apologise as his new powers manifest themselves in increasingly awkward and amusing ways. After accidentally beating up an entire subway carriage without any effort at all, Peter flees, and the action truly begins.The rest of the film is much more like the original. Whilst the villain is different (Rhys Ifans as Dr. Kurt Connors, AKA the Lizard) the concept is the same; our new hero learns to hone his skills and uses them to defend New York. A fracas with a back-alley gang makes Peter realise he needs a mask to disguise himself, and after initially going with a plain red wrestler's guise he eventually settles on that ever-so- familiar blue and red spandex suit. Fully suited and booted, he learns of an evil plot to destroy the whole of New York and, despite making enemies of the entire NYPD, goes off on a desperate bid to stop cliché becoming reality.Any action missing from the first hour is well and truly made up for here. Fight sequence after fight sequence sees Spidey win, then lose, then win, then lose again. Aided by Parker's notably adept love interest Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone proving she can do action just as well as comedy), he weaves his way in and out of schools, laboratories, offices and sewers in pursuit of the impressively realistic Lizard. Such is the intensity of the action that at times the viewer genuinely needs to sit back and take a breath, especially if said viewer is watching in 3D, here used to take full advantage of the long, swinging street shots so familiar to Spider-Man films.Though you might not be able to detect it, I honestly did love the original trilogy. But it really is blown clean out of the water by the new set-up. From the tense family scenes with Peter's Aunt and Uncle to the explosions and falling skyscrapers, the film is a credit to 2012's Superhero Summer. The only real problem I can find is that it's 2 years until the sequel. Anyone would think Marvel had lots of other projects to be working on...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A massive improvement on the original trilogy,"Many have complained about the premature reboot of the Spiderman franchise after the failure of Spiderman 3, but I believe that it was much needed, and a great success. Andrew Garfield trumps Toby McGuire in every way, Emma Stone trumps Kirsten Dunst, and the films takes a, thankfully, darker tone. Spiderman's suit looks very different to past films and comics, but it is fantastic. Spiderman's webbing no longer sprouts from his wrists, but is manufactured by Peter like in the comics. The villain of the film is my favourite in the Spiderman universe, and I have long awaited his appearance in one of the films. This movie looks fantastic in 3D, and it is the only film I have seen that I felt glad that it was in 3D (and yes, I have seen Avatar). Andrew Garfield, in my opinion, is the perfect choice to play Peter Parker, and those who chose him should definitely receive an award for their brilliance. He is not remotely similar to what Peter is seen as in the comics, but I think the the comics would be better off with Andrew Garfield starring. At the heart of it, The Amazing Spiderman also has a well told love story between Peter and Gwen Stacy, which I believe is better than Twilight will ever have. The main reason I am happy about this reboot is that it assures me that future sequels will be done in a similar tone and, if this is so, I will go to see every one of them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Spiderman Sputtered, Man!","I paid good money to see this and I was truly disappointed. The acting was superb and the cinematography was better than the Raimi version, but the buck stops there! Sam was a better story teller and you felt you didn't need to know much about the character before watching the movie. This new version lacks the plausibility of the whole story. It seems the director, Webb, wanted to make the unreal more realistic and bring him into our world not realizing that movie goers want to be transported into the world of the fantasy and get a break from ours. Garfield played a brooding web-slinger who was more concerned about finding himself than the killer of his Uncle. I know this movie stayed true to many parts of the comic book, but the character development was lacking and was only compensated by the brilliant actors playing the key roles. Spidey Sense was nowhere in this, his ability to heal quickly, and his reporter angles were also omitted. Another thing that bothered me was the fact that all of New York knew he was Spiderman. All except for Aunt May. I must say that no matter how old Sally Field gets she is still too sexy to play Aunt May. The wrestling angle and the slaying of Uncle Ben were too rushed in my opinion. Lizard seemed too powerful to be foiled by the weaker watered down version of Spiderman. Maybe Mr. Webb believed he was more qualified than anyone else because of his name. Even the explanation of how he got bitten was never properly explored. Garfield has a James Dean like quality in his acting and you felt as if you were more comfortable watching PP outside of the costume because Spiderman's identity was never truly developed. I would recommend watching the first two Raimi Spiderman movies than this watered down hapless version. The ending left you dissatisfied as if you were given a Whopper without any meat.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Doesn't get enough credit,"When this film came out on cinemas in 2012 I missed it, dismissing it as yet another entry into a waning franchise used as a mile to make more money. When I decided to give it a go in 2013 boy did I eat my words. Despite some unecassary mystery elements the film is bloddy brilliant. Andrew Garfield is low-key my favourite Spiderman, and although his second film isn't worth the paper the script was printed on, his first outing was amazing.

A newer Spiderman to carry on the franchise for eternity?,"Reboot from the Tobey Maguire era that was last seen in Spider-Man 3 in 2007. A new Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Andrew Garfield is introduced. I say introduced Garfield already has an extensive filmography. The origins of Spider-Man are explored again in detail! It takes just under the first hour of the film. The second half of the film sees Spider-Man battle an Incredible Hulk like lizard called interestingly The Lizard, Rhys Ifans. Good special effects. For the second film running the dreaded CGI has to be used despite some scenes being filmed for real. It doesn't distract from the main fabric of the film. The cast is a mixture of new blood as such and established movie stalwarts such as Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May respectively. I haven't seen Field since 1993s Mrs. Doubtfire. Garfield was in his late twenties yet the storyline of Peter Parker shows him as a nerdy 17 year old High School student. Very Michael J.

The untold story thats already been told,"As a big fan of Sam Raimi's films with everyone's favorite wall crawler and web slinger (yes, even the third one), I was more than skeptical when it came to this reboot. Hence it was no surprise I didn't like this film on a first watch and things didn't change with this rewatch either.Why do the origin story again, just tweaked a bit, when it was already perfectly done by Raimi? Because Sony was afraid to lose the rights to Marvel, if they didn't come up with something. And because it is a reboot so they need to restart the franchise and make some easy money while at it. What they came up with though is half-baked and disappointing on almost every level. I mean, just having to listen to Uncle Ben rephrase the classic line ""with great power comes great responsibility"" in order to avoid sounding too familiar to the original goes to show how pointless all of this is.This ""updated"" version for ""modern audiences"" completely changes Peter Parker into someone I don't find myself hurrying to root for. Compared to (and I know it's not really fair to compare it to the original but they basically asked for it) Tobey Maguire's character, this Peter Parker seems so shallow. In the original Peter Parker was a meek, even poor four-eyed crammer with no parents. In this, he wears contact lenses and has a skateboard. Just by giving Maguire's Parker this constant struggle with money you bring the audiences to side with him, not to mention the fact that he's an orphan. Here, it's almost taken for granted that we should root for him because he's an orphan, whereas I don't think that's enough. He seems like a spoiled brat who is too ""cool"" for his own sake. Andrew Garfield is fine for the most part but I don't find him particularly great in the role.Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard does a good job with what he's given; he's not given that much though. From the first time you see him he already begins laying out what he's all about: his obsession with finding a medical solution for his missing arm. Not that I'm expecting deep character development or solid motives when it comes to the villain but it sure helps to flesh him out a bit.I'm not going to get into the whole Gwen Stacy romance and the sub-plot with her father but they seem as poorly handled as the rest of the characters/relationships. It's not a terrible film by any means, I actually enjoyed it somewhat. I liked how Spider-Man saved the kid on the bridge, the fight in the school and in the sewers, the fact that they made Spider-Man a very agile superhero and that they went for a dramatic, almost corny tone by the end. All of that I liked. But. It felt like a rushed and unnecessary rehash of already great content.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not as amazing as implied by the title, but still pretty thrilling and pleasantly romantic.","Most would probably look to Chris Nolan's intense and morally complex The Dark Knight as the pinnacle of the superhero genre (which it arguably is), but if you ask me, the Spiderman films from quirky director Sam Raimi were what validated the genre in the first place. With an expert mix of sincere emotion, stylistic action, and just the right amount of Raimi's trademark goofiness, Spiderman and its superior sequel saw the genre at its most entertaining. After the disastrously disappointing Spiderman 3, it seemed like an odd move for Sony to reboot the series so quickly. But what the newly released The Amazing Spiderman may lack in the same creativity, it makes up for with heart and scale.Peter Parker is your not quite average high school kid. He struggles with bullies at school, his feelings for Gwen Stacy, and trying to figure out the secrets of his deceased father, a former scientist at Oscorp who worked with Dr. Curt Connors, a man trying to invent a serum that would restore the amputated limbs of many people, including his own arm. Searching for answers, he is bitten by a genetic spider that gives him superhuman abilities, and through a series of events that take place, Spiderman, as we now know him, is born... again. But it isn't long after Peter takes up his job as the masked webslinger that complications arise, becoming sought after by the NYPD as a vigilante, and facing off with Connors, whose serum has transformed him into the hideous Lizard.Look, it's hard not to compare this to Raimi's first Spiderman film, especially when it revisits a lot of the same plot points, but it still provides its own uniqueness on the hero. Fun, funny, and superbly realized, The Amazing Spiderman also drags occasionally, and leaves several loose ends that may frustrate some viewers, or maybe just leave them scratching their heads. Action is also surprisingly spread out in light doses, but thankfully so in how it lets the story flow so smoothly. Marc Webb, director of the sleeper hit (500) Days of Summer, wouldn't appear to be the obvious choice for this movie, but you really begin to understand why he was chosen as the movie moves along.At the core of this movie is the irresistible love story between Peter and Gwen, delicately played by Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. This movie was what apparently led to the two stars becoming a real life couple, and it's easy to see why, because they share chemistry that makes the love feel genuine. The acting is uniformly good, from Garfield and Stone especially. The supporting performances from Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, and Martin Sheen are excellent, although I can't help but wish they'd have given Leary and his character George Stacy, Gwen's father and a captain of the NYPD, more on screen time.Technically, the film is excellent. The editing, though occasionally sluggish, is still carefully handled by Alan Bell and Pietro Scalia. The effects supervised by Jerome Chen are pretty stellar, and Shannon Mills and Addison Teague provide creative and robust sound effects. Prepare to be blown away by composer James Horner, who gives us his greatest musical score since that of Titanic, a thematically rich and proudly old fashioned throwback complete with a heroic, and memorable main theme. It truly is spectacular, barely surpassing Danny Elfman's music for Raimi's movies in the process.In short, though it's really not something I'm encouraging anyone to look too deeply into, did we really need this movie so soon after the originals? Maybe we didn't, but for what it is, you can't fault it for not quite living up to high expectations when it still is pretty entertaining. Not as amazing as the title may imply, but close enough.**** / *****",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The most relatable spider-man,"When I stepped inside the cinema hall, i was apprehensive, if this series would really live up to the Toby Maguire trilogy as Andrew Garfield is not only different but also a weird choice for the role but the moment, the film started, you completely forget the previous one.Even though you know the plot quite well, the slight modification in it works in favor of the film than against it. This one makes spider-man more believable with an interplay of several emotions like breaking down, arrogance, anger etc. Andrew Garfield is absolutely spot on as the new spider-man and delivers one scene after the other with so much finesse that it leaves you stunned and probably you may end up reaching a conclusion like me that he's certainly better. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is perfect and their chemistry has the right amount of reluctance, awkwardness but yet it touches your heart. The 3D effects are terrific in the parts when spider-man is swinging in the Manhattan skies.If your looking for more action and 3D effects then you may not like this movie but if you can accept a spider-man with his weaknesses but yet a zeal to protect his nation and ground in reality with an eerie relatability, this one is meant for you.

"Look, I like this movie!","Honestly I genuinely like this movie. I understand it's flaws but as a massive Spider-Man fan I just cannot hate it. This movie has a lot of great aspects, the effects are really good and consistent throughout, the acting is also really good and everyone is doing an amazing job. I really like Aunt May and Uncle Ben in this, they get a good amount of screen time in this and so they feel a lot more fleshed out. I like that it's not a straight copy of the Sam Rami Spider-Man films and I'm glad they went in a different direction and also used a villain that hadn't been done yet. The lizard is a great villain to start a Spider-Man series with as he has such a connection to Peter Parker himself, it's a shame the actually design for the lizard is the greatest but the build up and backstory to him works with this film. I like Andrew Garfield and he genuinely is a great actor and you can tell he loves this character alot, my problem is that he's just way too cool and way too punk-ish in this film for me to believe that he's Peter Parker but I just can't help but like him, he's just so likeable. His chemistry with Emma Stone as Gwen is really good though, and they really have a good connection in this film and it really makes their relationship on screen feel real. When he is actually Spider-Man, I love it, he is quipy and funny and just feels good as the web slinger. Onto the stupid things, the suit in this movie looks terrible, the colours are vibrant enough, the eyes are too small and it just isn't a great suit. The score/soundtrack is horrible, it's so annoying and isn't memorable at all and I just don't think it works at all in any of the scenes. The editing is awful aswell, some of the scenes just cut way too many times and it looks so stupid, it feels like a mistake. I also don't give a damn about Peters parents, I really don't need a big backstory of what happened to them, why can't they just keep it simple and just have it so they died when Peter was young, why do they need to have importance in the overall story, I do not care for them at all and I hate that they try to make them relevant in this series. All in all I really don't mind this movie, yes it has alot of flaws but I still love it deep down and I will always revisit it and give it a watch every now and then and I'll take it as another movie edition into the greatest superhero ever!

Identity Crisis Gem,"We all know who Spider-Man is: an orphan who lives with his uncle and aunt, likes photography, one day, he gets bitten by a radioactive spider and gets superpowers.Obviously, I didn't have to tell you that. But what I would like to ask you is, what Spider-Man are we talking about?When you think of Spider-Man, you probably remember the one from the cartoons or the comics, but most of us think of the one from the classic Sam Raimi movie adaptations . They we're fun and campy, but also intense and action-packed, and alongside movies like The X-Men movies and the Fantastic 4 movies, they popularized the comic book movie genre, that we've later seen evolve into a money printing machine back in the 2010's. They are iconic, and even while the 3rd movie got mixed receptions, the trilogy was a huuuge success at the box-office.After the third movie made almost a billion dollars, talks for a fourth movie immediatly started, and Columbia Pictures announced on Twitter that Spider-Man 4 will release in May of 2011:
""Sony Pictures
@SonyPicturesSony Pictures to release Spider-Man 4 on May 6, 2011.6:53 PM · Mar 12, 2009""But after a troubled production, the movie was cancelled in January 2010, and instead they decided to just reboot the franchise, with Marc Webb as director, James Vanderbilt as writer, and Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker.So, the movie came out in 3rd of July in 2012 in the US, and while it got mixed reviews, it made around 758 million dollars,successful enough to get a sequel in 2014 that I'll talk about in the future.But what makes this movie stand out from the Sam Raimi Trilogy?The story is pretty much the same as Spider-Man 2002: some orphan dork gets bitten by a sipder, becomes powerful, his uncle dies and then finds himself the enemy of some antagonistic scientist. There's some romance, some action, and at the end Spider-Man defeats the bad guy with the help of New York and, of course, his superpowers.But this one is different. The tone is a litttle bit darker, the story is longer, and we get more scenes of Peter both as a teen and as a vigilante.In my opinion, I would categorize the movie in two halfs: the first one where we see Peter's origin story, and the second half where we see him as Spider-Man fighting The Lizard.The first half mostly consists of dialogue scenes and world building, where we see the daily life of Peter and of Dr. Curt Connors, but also how they get their powers. To be honest with you, the first hour of this movie was pretty bad. Obviously there was some good stuff, but the pacing was all over the place and the dialogue was mediocre.-I actually like Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker, he fits the bold yet nerdy personailty of our friendly neightbour, capturing the youthfulness of adolescency and I like that he was more flawed, and that he's fascinated by science and skateboarding. I just wished that his motivation was more well structured and that the transition between Peter and Spider-Man was less abrupt. Also we get more of him and his parents, but the scenes don't really go anywhere besides being loosely related to the antagonist.-I didn't care about Uncle Ben's death, because the times where we saw him had so e really stupid dialogue. They tried to make him funny and relatable, but we don't see him form a strong emotional bond with Peter. Aunt May was a nice inclusion.-And while I liked Dr. Curt Connors, I wish he was less of a one dimensional science guy. He came off as cartoony and annoying, and not behaving like a human being. I wish the characters behaved more like human beings in general. Overall the first half came out as pretentious and overly ambitious, trying to do too much than it could and was neccesary.And this is where we go to the second half of the movie.Once we get to see Spider-Man swinging around the streets, the plot starts being more straightforward. The characters' motivations becomes clear and easy to digest, the interactions are more relaxed and the tense scenes of this half are the highlight of the movie.-Dr. Curt Connors's motivation, while arguably juvenile, it was enough to understand him, but also to become a threat to New York.-Spider-Man's motivation is more clear, and is pretty logical since he was researched on the subject, understading the threat of The Lizard.-Spider-Man and The Lizard have similar, interconnected backstories, making for a great conflict between the two powerful beings.-The tone an the dialogue became more consistent, and the characters strated to have a presenceOverall this movie feels like it wanted to be so many things, but ended up a simple super hero flick, but surprinsingly unique. It has an interesting protagonist, in a threatning antanogist and some nice action and interactions. And while is not great, I still consider it a worthy addition the Spider-Man series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Truly AMAZING,"This was truly a great movie, each character was developed perfectly that it did not lag in the storyline at all. Andrew Garfield was the perfect role for Spider-man and now I can't see anybody doing better in that role. Although the Sam Raimi films were good, the reboot was so much better. I watched it 3 times, and all the details were so carefully perfected that it was not just the amazing swinging scenes or special effects that wowed me, but the little things as well. The Chemistry between Peter(Andrew) and Gwen(Emma) was so realistic, and was so believable. Andrew Garfield nailed it in the role of Peter Parker. He gives teenagers something to relate to, just a normal skinny guy, who finds the hero in himself that is Spider-man. The themes of this movie are so inspirational and great, the theme of the misunderstanding of the spider, the life and problems of a regular teenager, and the will of Good vs Evil. Definitely owning this on Blu-ray, and I don't even care that some of the scenes shown in the trailer were deleted, as everything about this movie turned out to be AMAZING. Definitely looking forward to the sequels in what will be a wonderful trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
'The Amazing Spider-Man' (2012) vs. 'Spider-Man' (2002),"It is a truth universally acknowledged that the best superhero story is an origin story. Comic books can get complicated, with too many villains and alternate universes to keep track of. The stories everyone remembers are the simple ones. Superman was sent to earth just before his home planet of Krypton was destroyed. Bruce Wayne's parents were killed by a mugger, and he used his wealth to transform himself into Batman. Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider and became Spider-Man after his uncle was murdered.'The Amazing Spider-Man' is a fine origin story. Marc Webb does a good job of telling the tale. Andrew Garfield makes a convincing Peter Parker. The problem, though, is that we were told this story just a decade ago. Not enough time has passed for it to be retold.I went into the movie trying not to compare Sam Raimi's 2002 'Spider- Man' with Webb's reboot. I soon realized the task would be impossible.Tobey Maguire (2002) as Peter Parker had a more natural and believable progression into the role of Spider-Man than Garfield (2012) had. This wasn't a fault of Garfield or a credit to Maguire, but a failing of the new script.The succinct words of Cliff Robertson (2002) as Uncle Ben -- 'With great power comes great responsibility' -- had much more of an impact than those of Martin Sheen (2012) -- ""If you have the ability to do some good in this world, you have a moral obligation to do so.""J.K. Simmons (2002) as J. Jonah Jameson was a much more memorable supporting character than Denis Leary (2012) as Captain Stacy.Even the typical scene of New York solidarity was done better in the older film. Someone in a crowd of New Yorkers shouting, ""You mess with Spidey, you mess with New York! You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!"" (2002) was more touching than a group of crane operators who aligned their machines to provide Spider-Man with a path to swing through the city in the climax (2012).The only thing that was undeniably better in the new film was the addition of Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy. Stone is an amazing actress who simply lit up every scene she was in.Garfield did his best; indeed, he makes a great Peter Parker. And Webb did his best; 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is a great origin story.But we had a slightly better one just ten years ago.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Terrible (One possible spoiler - line quote),"Take some non-entity actors and actresses, reciting wooden lines in a wooden manner, redo a story for no reason, cut corners, and what do you get? You guessed it! I wish it wasn't true, but it is. Might be a good deal at the dollar cinemas, if one has nothing else to do. The lead actor has a complete lack of presence or charisma, the special effects are drab, the supporting actors may as well be cardboard cutouts with digital recorders strapped to them. The droning subplot scene in school is so hackneyed, trotting Martin Sheen in could not hope to save it. Gee, nerdy guy with glasses shows up the school alpha male jock, and gets the pretty blonde girl - how many thousands of times have I seen this movie? And, sadly, contains a real message, advocating the dispersing of biological agents by corporations (""we could cure polio in an afternoon"") to genetically modify the population without their knowledge, or approval, which is being developed in real life, To ""help"" us, it is said.

A Punk Peter Parker,"What makes Spider-Man, or rather Peter Parker, such a great character is that at heart he's just a kid. But what this kid, this Peter Parker, more than any other, emphasizes is what a lonely, angry, frustrated, horny, punk teenage orphan he really is. And Garfield does a nice job presenting him as such.But after screening it, I can't help but feel empty... that it's all just icing. There's no overarching message that preaches 'with great power comes great responsibility'. It constantly undercuts the significance of a promise. Its position on vengeance and vigilante justice is left ambiguous...For all the visual wonder, especially in IMAX 3D, I can't help but note how it seems so shallow.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Delivers the goods for Spidey fans.,"Just 10 years after the first official big screen adaptation of the legendary Spider-Man comic books, Sony saw fit to reboot the series, with another rehashing of the now familiar origin story. Granted, it plays out with some minor differences, but the end result is pretty much the same.Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield, inheriting the role from Tobey Maguire) is a high school photographer with an aptitude for science as well. He makes the acquaintance of Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), a scientist who was working with Peters' father (Campbell Scott, in a VERY brief cameo). Connors' experiments go seriously awry when he injects himself with a serum derived from lizards, and therefore becomes The Lizard, one of Spidey's familiar nemeses. Peter, who's acquired superhuman abilities after being bitten by a genetically enhanced arachnid, realizes that it's his duty to stop him.Longtime devotees of the character and his adventures should be satisfied, although more casual watchers will only feel a sense of deja vu. There's the usual smorgasbord of CGI effects (although director Marc Webb and company supposedly wanted as many practical stunts as possible), and mayhem. In my own humble opinion, the script wasn't that great, in terms of both plot and dialogue. The biggest problem for me was that the film makes a waste of some of its acting talent, giving old pros like Sally Field (as Aunt May) and Martin Sheen (as the ill-fated Uncle Ben) little to do. At least Peters' love interest, Gwen Stacy (a radiant Emma Stone), gets to do her own bit during the heroism of the final act. As for Pete / Spidey, Garfield comes off better once in costume and incapacitating bad guys, nailing some of the cockiness and wisecracking of the character. Ifans is good as the well-intentioned antagonist who becomes the monster. Denis Leary is fine as Captain Stacy, who criticizes the efforts of this ""masked vigilante"". And Stan Lee, naturally, has his usual cameo.Overall, the film isn't what I would call ""bad"": the performances are good and the action reasonably well-handled. But, as I said before, if one is not a longtime follower of Spidey's comic adventures, they're not likely going to get that much out of it.Followed by one more Spidey movie with Garfield; this film is dedicated to the late Laura Ziskin (producer) and J. Michael Riva (production designer).Six out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The epitome of excellence in film entertainment,"Famous writers, and some not so famous, will look at their works and immediately begin to rework and rewrite them. It is in their nature. Something can always be refined, always made more concise. Editors share a similar foible. This is the case with the latest incarnation of comic book fav, Spider-Man. THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN is a much better telling of the web head's tale; a tighter script, a more eristic tale, and a more involved and inspired cast. THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN is two and a half hours in length, but as I watched the advanced press screening, I was totally unaware of the passage of time; certainly an indication of a well-made film. This version of Spidey is definitely worth the price of admission and repeated viewings. It is one you will be able to watch numerous times and still cull entertainment from; a definite addition to your home video collection. As such, it wins the coveted Fist of Fiore Award for 2012, exemplifying excellence in film entertainment.Sometimes what is new is old again. Most of the superhero reboots return to a truer, if grizzlier version of the original comic tale. THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN returns Peter Parker to high school, rather than college. Encountering Professor Cur Connors is therefore a bit of a story bend. The connection between Peter's parents and Sgt. Nick Fury's S.H.I.E.L.D. organization is hinted at, opening doors for Spidey to cameo or co-star with either the X-Men or, more likely, The Avengers. Peter/Spidey is played by Andrew Garfield. He offers a passionate, modern approach to the character, but, again, this is his first outing. Tobey McGuire was solid in his first appearance as the Web-head, too. It wasn't until the sequels his contempt for the part was demonstrated.Emma Stone, sporting a coiffure of blonde tresses, is Gwen Stacey, Peter's first true love. Emma is more than another glitz of glamour on the Silver Screen. She also displays amazing acting prowess and a precocious understanding of the camera lens. In THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, she is a scene stealer.Also in the cast are Rhys Ifans as Dr. Connors and Denis Leary as Captain George Stacey. Ifans is adequate in the role but his relationship with Peter is stilted; not from the acting, but rather a lull in the script. The original tales tell of a deep friendship between Connors and Peter, but Screenwriter James Vanderbilt doesn't reveal the rudiments of the friendship, save for an intellectual appreciation on the introductory level. Leary, on the other hand, is reduced to an extended cameo part. He is able, however, to portray Captain Stacey as a knowingly perceptive policeman and loving father. Finally, there is the Hitchcockian cameo by Stan Lee as the high school librarian, played in a collision montage for laughs.THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN has a few drawbacks. One major issue is the appearance of The Lizard. In the comics, The Lizard had large protruding jaws jammed with razor sharp teeth. In this incantation, there are no jaws, just a distorted scaly face. It's not as menacing. This version of The Lizard is also cleaver and calculating. I seem to remember when Connors transformed into The Lizard, he became savage and rather mindless. (If my memory is faulty, I'm sure the comic book fans will forward emails to point out the error of my aging recollections.) The rest of The Lizard is excellently done by Production Designer J. Michael Riva. It somewhat compensates for the lack of jaws.The other issue is one that plagues most superheroes. It's the egotistic desire of the lead actors to rip off the mask. In the last trilogy, Tobey McGuire made it a requirement. He was delusional enough to think his fans wanted to see him and not the superhero in full costume. Garfield is taking the same approach. Every major character in this story knows Parker is Spidey by the film's end. It makes the entire concept of a secret identity rather moot. The only sequence where the mask removal is viable and in character is when Spidey saves Jack, the little boy on the bridge.KEY SCENES TO LOOK FOR: 1. ON THE ROOFTOP WITH GWEN AFTER DINNER 2. THE SCHOOL BATTLE WITH LIZARD 3. FIRST ENCOUNTER ON THE BRIDGE 4. THE IMAX WEB TRAVELLING SCENES 5. THE JACKIE CHAN STYLE SUBWAY FIASCOI had the opportunity to see THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN in 3d IMAX. It's definitely worth it. The sequences of Spidey swinging through Manhattan are quite entertaining and effectively shot. Cinematographer John Schwartzman utilizes camera angles exceptionally well to compensate for any flaws in CGI. And, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the Armstrong family. For years I have made it a point to highlight when Vic Armstrong is involved with a film. The iconic 1980's stuntman is now passing the torch as the entire Armstrong family is engaged in fight sequencing and stunts for this film. Daddy Vic serves as second unit director.THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN has a conclusion, but leaves so many doors open Columbia Studios can really take this saga in any number of directions. There is the now obligatory added scene after the credits, so be sure to stay to the very end. All told, though, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is a most noble reboot of the franchise, a great movie, and, at the risk of angering comic fanboys everywhere, a lot better than THE AVENGERS.THE RATING FOR THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN = A-30-Fiore Mastracci is host and producer of the award-winning Outtakes, soon to celebrate 500 shows.

The Amazing Spider-Man - Truly Amazing,"When I heard there was a reboot of Spider-Man, I sort of rolled my eyes and thought, ""Great, another money-maker."" But after watching The Amazing Spider-Man, I can really see the relevance of it and why it's okay. I will start by saying that this movie was simply fantastic.Sure, you've got your expected scenes of Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) bitten by a spider, getting powers and all that, but it's how they delve into the character and his backstory that really makes this film shine.This movie really focuses the attention on Peter's desire to be with his parents, and his curiosity as to why they aren't around. Peter has to deal with so many issues colliding into him at once that it seems a bit overbearing for him.     It's inevitable that people are going to compare The Amazing Spider-man to Sam Raimi's Spider-Man from 2002. I will say that this one is just darker and takes on a much more serious tone.The acting in this movie is superb. You couldn't have cast a better Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen). He makes his character so real and relatable. Andrew Garfield too was witty and his emotions felt genuine. You could really see the pain in his face when certain events took place.There are a few things about this movie that are subtle, but really make the movie better than any of the others. I like that throughout the movie, Peter Parker looks like he got the crap beaten out of him when he's finished patrolling or going after bad guys. He has black eyes and bruises almost the entire movie and that makes it a lot more realistic. Also, his costume stays ripped and torn, because, well, he didn't have time to fix it. Go figure!I also really liked how Parker used his webbing in the story. It's so smart. He wasn't just using them to swing from one place to another, but to actually try to figure out things, like where the lizard was hiding. It's hard to explain without giving away too much, but it was a nice touch.  It was refreshing for Spider-Man to have a different love interest and Emma Stone did very well at portraying Gwen Stacy.Now, the reason I see the relevance of a reboot is this: In the past Spider-Man movies, there were no smart phones, Facebook, and few people used the Internet like they do today. I read about this in another article and I completely agree. We live in a much different world than we did even 5 years ago. Smartphones didn't even exist when we started Sam Raimi's Spider-Man. It really changes how things are done today and it was nice to see all of this in action.There's also a very touching scene that really shows that the common man too can be a hero. When you watch the movie, just remember crane operators.    This was a great movie experience and I would recommend it to anyone.The McDandy Rating: A MUST SEEFor more reviews, visit: http://mcdandyreviews.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Skate or die,"I saw this movie about 3 years ago. What do I recall? I remember a 15 minute scene where Peter Parker used his new found powers to skateboard. Skateboard. He uses his powers to skateboard. Sure, I would have some fun trying out activities with super human abilities but that doesn't mean it would be fun for anyone to watch me for 15 minutes doing said activity. So I bring this up as an example that just because some things would be fun or look cool does not make it an interesting aspect of story telling. I did like exploring the avenue of pain and loss from having your parents leave as a child, which is why Parker lives with his uncle and aunt. You will get a full dose of action (so much that it becomes meaningless), the glossy/bright comic book feel, and occasional nice moments between actors. It is good for a one time watch, but nothing demands or warrants a second viewing in my life.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Review,"I really liked the old spiderman movies so I guess I starting to watch this one being a little bit skeptical because there were new actors etc. But as it went on I started enjoying it and the characters started to grow. I did like a lot of the new scenes, but what I really didn't like was that some scenes from the old ones were gone, some key scenes in my opinion. Overall this movie just seemed a lot more non violent and more child-friendly. I think it's worth watching but I honestly thought Spiderman 1 was way better. I think the actors did great however. But I grew up with the old movies and I really liked them, I just don't see why they didn't just make a spiderman 4 rather than remaking something that was already great.

Liz-ard's days night.,"Been a while since I watched the Garfield era Spider-man films. At the time I felt, perhaps like most, that Garfield himself was a strong Peter Parker, but that the films, particularly the sequel, were a bit underwhelming. This version of the character was given a popularity boost by ""No Way Home"" so much so that rumours continue to persist that it's this version of Spiderman that Sony should use for their extended universe films (they should). I feel pretty similar after this viewing.Raised by his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) since the disappearance of his parents, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) discovers a connection between his father, and Scientist Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) who works for science conglomerate OsCorp. Whilst sneaking away from a tour, Parker is bitten by a Spider from an experiment, which given him superhuman strength and the ability to climb up walls. Parker provides Connors with an equation that his father was working on, to stabilise combining animal genetic material with human. Though the aim is to regrow his missing limb, like a Lizard might, instead the serum transforms Connors into a giant powerful creature, though retaining his intelligence.The cast are all really good, though Garfield is particularly strong. He's already in his late twenties, so doesn't particularly convince as a teenager but he nails Parker's shy wit and intelligence, and his wisecracking Spider-man is closer to the comic character than perhaps either of the two cinematic incarnations we've seen. Emma Stone, is of course brilliant too as Gwen Stacy, doomed love interest of Parker and a brave, smart companion for him. I like Rhys Ifans too, even if his, internally confused villain, conflicted and talking to himself rings a little close to Defoe's Green Goblin.The film in general is perhaps solid, but not great. Spiderman's action scenes are good, and his battles with The Lizard are first-rate. It's saddled with a bit too much back story and origin business to deal with though, it includeds the death of Uncle Ben again, as well as the Spider bite and the transformation, but now there's added intrigue by tying Peter's Parents back into the story and to OsCorp. It makes the film feel very long, cramming so much in. The Lizard isn't a great looking character - personally I don't think the issue is with poor or rushed CGI work, as has been with recent Marvel films, but rather more that the character design is odd. Not really resembling a recognisable creature, in fact the nearest thing I thought of was the Goomba's in the Mario Brothers Movie.I hope they can find a way for Garfield to play Peter Parker again as he's so good, and never really got the films to match him.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

But it's still a massive recommendation. *Please note that I might be slightly biased, but I still believe it's a must-watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but not ""Amazing!""","Now I am in two minds about this movie. I did enjoy it. But at the end off the day I think ""The amazing Spiderman"" is just, well, ""Spiderman.""There is nothing truelly ""amazing"" or even that different about this movie when compared to the others. The only things that will make it perhaps a bit better to some are its leads. Andrew Garfield is a great choice to play the character, and having Gwen Stacy as his love interest seems to have fans happier than they were before, with Emma Stone doing a decent job. Altogether the romance here is sweeter, funnier and more believable. But is that really what people wanted from a ""Spiderman"" reboot? The Biggest complaints I heard about the original trilogy were that they were too soppy. And it looks like instead off getting away from that here, they are going to delve even further into it in this new series.So they've improved it where it didn't need improved. The Story desperately tries to retell the origins as differently as possible, but it still turns out as overly familiar. There's some decent action, but you'll be waiting a while (We have to get through the whole origin story again remember) and the villain is OK but could off been done way better. Just like the villain in the original ""Spiderman"" film then?What I think saves ""The Amazing Spiderman"" though is it's sense off humour. Its pretty funny, and you can tell there's a lot off effort been put into making it what it is. Even though I still can't get over the feeling that they've restarted the series way too early. If they'd just made ""Spiderman 4"" with different actors it would off probably had the same effect. When I heard a kid saying ""they ignored the other movies"" on the way out.

The Average Spider-man 2012,"Why does this movie even exist? Sony cant even wait 10 years until remaking a modern classic and not doing it justice by letting too many subtleties slip through their fingers.We are never told what happens to uncle bens killer, their is no real driving force behind what anyone is doing besides 'its just happening and i need to do this stuff because i want to bla bla bla' everything seems rushed.The CGI is OK for the mostpart until we get to see the lizardman, wow they cant even get lipsync right in 2012 when the 10 year old original movie could.I have seen older indie movies with better cgi, in this is was over the top and quite unessicary.Some more practical effects would have been nice.Sony get butthurt after their meddling of the 2007 Spiderman 3 movie.Sam Riami quits and now they remake his superior movie in favor of this teen centric generic movie with more product placement then a 80's scifi.Sure it got the basics right but it never tried to do anything new like Spiderman 2002.On top of a equally generic story, music, themes and obviously predictable outcome.There is just no point to this movie AT ALL.Hopefully 2 will be better like 2004's spiderman 2 but at least they might fix whatever the hell was going on with Spiderman 3.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Amazing Spiderman is TRULY AMAZING! (Don't go after haters - Watch it to believe it),The Amazing Spiderman Saw this movie this evening and honestly after reading few reviews on IMDb - I went in with no high hopes. But Marc Webb proved me wrong! His last movie '500 Days of Summer' was a classic movie and he played his charm again with The Amazing Spiderman.The movie followed the storyline of Spiderman Comics closely and had no fillers like Sam Raimi's version. Andrew Garfield portrayed spiderman in a perfect manner and his acting was amazing! Graphics were the BEST in its category and were zillion times better than that of franchise's previous attempts. The story line is more deeper and would reveal a lot more secrets of Peter Parker's life in coming movies.I hate it when people compare it with Batman - Of course Bruce Wayne is a grown up man with responsibilities while Peter Parker is just a teenage guy with amazing super powers who also deals with responsibilities. So its obvious he will tackle with his teenage problems unlike Batman. But seriously need to stop comparing and enjoy both the movies.This flick is 8/10 but I'm rating it 10 because many people are hating on this without even seeing it for once.Must Watch,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Although I still prefer Tobey Maguire,Andrew Garfield did a terrific job,","The Amazing Spider Man is a fantastic movie with some great actors,action and a heartwarming storyline that lives up to the previous three,I do think Tobet=y Maguire is better because I grew up watching his Spider Man movies,but Andrew Garfield was still terrific and I couldn't imagine anyone being a better replacement than him.Its not like this has never happened before,there isn't one James Bond,there isn't one Batman,and stuff like this will continue.Spider Man is my all time favorite superhero,always has been,always will be.I love the villains,but the Lizard has always been one of my favorites and I'm glad they went with him.I sure we get to see Andrew Garfield in an Avengers sequel.Peter Parker(Andrew Garfield) is having a tuff time at school,dealing with bullies and the death of his parents,with his aunt and uncle minding him and cant take up the courage to tell Gwen Stacey(Emma Stone) he likes her.But all this changes when he is bitten by a spider and becomes his alter ego,Spider Man.However fighting crime,the cops are after him,including Gwens father(Denis Leary).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Film.....makes u feel Craving For More....,"It is hard to believe that some DIE HARD fans of Spider-Man have hated this film....Probably because of the recasting.In My opinion it was a good film Well i would say better than spider-man..! Yeah personally i feel what was not in the original film was in TASM..like when uncle Ben dies u really feel sorry for Peter...in the original one i,literally,laughed at the poor crying boy..The chemistry between Emma Stone and Andrew Was also great to watch. In terms of acting Everyone played their part quite well.. i personally and genuinely feel that Andrew Garfield is a great Spider- Man/Peter Parker.It was funny,it was sad,it was ""AMAZING""..It has great scope as a franchise ..i think Sony took a right decision in rebooting the series. Waiting for TASM 2....Nuff Said!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Unnecessary reboot?,"The amazing spiderman was an unnecessary reboot but I'm glad its come about anyway. Spiderman has always been a cheesy and weak superhero tale for me however this new take on the web slinger is invigorating. The focus on his parents is new, as is the new love interest, both worked but what worked more is Andrew Garfield as spiderman. In now way is he a believable geek, Tobey Maguire is a better Peter Parker but Garfield is a better Spiderman in more ways then one. He's funny and cool, everything a super hero should be. More importantly he's genuine, he brings some reality to the role. Mark Webb has done a superb job in re-creating spiderman and creating new paths to explore in an otherwise plain story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spiderman... not so amazing after all.,"I recently decided to watch ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" hoping to see a decent adventure now in summer and expecting an even better point of view than the previous movies of Raimi. Well, Spiderman... was not so amazing after all.At first, I will start with a reference at the cast. I didn't know Andrew Garfield (Spiderman) to be honest, and I was unsure about his acting skills. My instinct was right after all. His playing was more like a teenager getting excited to be a mutant hero and the sense of reality was nowhere to be found. It was like he wanted it and it happened. No convincing about his feelings in his act. The rest of the cast apart from Martin Sheen, of course, and a surprisingly good Emma Stone, as the romance person in the movie, was not something special.About the script and directing now. i didn't like it. OK, standard special effects we see in every movie like this, some mildly impressing scenes etc. But, the story WAS MISSING. A lot of loose ends, in fact we learned few things about Peter Parker. The director was more eager to show as how cool was Spiderman that he forgot to show us how he became Spiderman. And here it is Garfield's fault too. He wasn't convincing in his emotions, it was like a super-wow phase it happened to him and he enjoyed it rather than a drastic change in his body and mind and the consequences. My thought is Maguire was better. And the script and cast of the first Spiderman movie, which we can compare with, is better.To sum up, the movie was way below the expectations. A lot of plot gaps, unconvincing acting (mainly from the protagonist) and very limited action are the main points which indicate that you should see the movie only as a last minute choice in the drought of the summer (as I did).",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Its good. Kind of bland,I prefer amazing Spiderman 2. Andrew is an ok Peter Parker. No where near great.This first take when i watch it feels grey and bland.The fight scenes don't interest me. It has a story going but it just feels too gray and lacks flavor.My nitpick is the lizard looks weird. I never liked his design.1 positive is the parking lot car scene.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The usual averageness,"I am so beyond tired of this same old routine with Spider-Man.When are these movies ever actually gonna learn from what has come before and how to improve upon it?This movie is way too harshly hated upon but it still has the same issue I've been begging to be improved in literally every single Spider-Man movie.Which is why can't we ever get a Spider-Man movie where the side characters are fully developed and actually matter by themselves?It's what we got in the Raimi movies. With how MJ don't matter by herself only that she with Spider-Man does she mean anything of importance. And every other character don't matter at all when they're by themselves only when Peters around do they matter.In this movie it repeated again I don't get to see any character matters unless Peter is around them.Like Peters is meant to be a 3 dimensional character but no one around him have any dimensions you can't just try to make one character have complex layers but not apply that to anyone else.If I don't care for anyone close to Peter I don't care much for him either.How do these movies keep messing this up?So yeah I don't have much to say other than this movie didn't make me feel much at all just like the Raimi movies and like its not like really bad cause The Raimi movies and this one blends together.They are frankly all on the same level of quality cause they can only give the very bare minimum nothing more or less.Here it's no differentPeters Parents, Flash the bully, Gwen's relationship, Doctor Connors, Oscorps projects, Uncle Bens and Aunt May and all the side characters and subplots only gets the very bare minimum of development.You don't get any more deeper complex levels of stuff with them and when you do it ends as soon it begins.6/10

Could Have Been Amazing,"In 2012 there was the much hyped Spiderman reboot with Andrew Garfield as our lovable Peter Parker. It had been some years since the Raimi trilogy ended and we obviously wanted more. So Sony decided it was time and made a reboot for us.The Amazing Spiderman is another franchise reboot which falls prey to the success of the Dark Knight trilogy. Given a much grittier, darker , serious tone to a character that is supposed to be fun, humorous and colorful.It strips all the color and style from the Raimi films to settle for a tone and look
that resembles a sci fi drama rather than a comic book. All of that can be overlooked if they didn't make the fatal mistake of marketing the film as ""AN UNTOLD STORY"". They should have just called it a reboot and it would have been fine.Instead we slog through stuff we have already seen in the previous films.The film also chooses to have a lot of fun, cute, quirky humour in between really seroius drama which sadly comes at the expense of our Hero's morality and character development.This new version of Parker beats up Flash and humiliates him not in self defense but just to have a lot of fun, he develops a mean streak after a significant event in his life and comes across as a sinister hero who resembles more of Batman than Spiderman.But there are a few redeeming qualities within the film , the sequence where he saves the kid from a bridge is a heartfelt one, one which respects him as a character, the action looks a lot better even if it isn't ambitious, the effects look believable, the performances are fairly good across the board, our lead pair in Gwen Stacy(Emma Stone) and Andrew Garfield(Peter Parker) are pretty great,
the first person perspective shots when Spiderman swings look cool.The cinematography is fairly decent, given that the film adopts a darker Gotham-esque look and feel to it, the music by James Horner is amazing and unique and much under appreciated and can easily stand on its own without recalling the Raimi trilogy.Overall the film lacks a certain style , a pace, to keep things interesting, there are large stretches which just drag on and on and feel lifeless. There are some strange choices, especially character choices which just make your eyes roll and really don't make a whole lot of sense but just happen to move the plot along.Again all that is passable if you are engaged in the story and characters which this film shows potential to do but doesn't exactly swing it all the way.The occasional humour and the goofyness doesn't fit at all with the tone that they take, making you confused as to whether you should have fun or not.The film adopts a darker tone and rides on it but it seems to not fully commit to it resulting in a reboot that disappoints, but in a good way I guess, you could say that they tried to make it work, they did their own thing, didn't rely on any nostalgia, they created something on their own with an established well known property, maybe the sequel could be better(It wasn't!).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely Excellent,No idea where all the negative feedback has come from. This is a great film. Its brilliantly acted and the story flows. The characters behave believably and all in all its much more spider man than the previous. I suspect that a lot of the negative comments on here are due to a love of the previous series but for me they were never that tremendous. Spider-Man acts much more like Spider-Man should with his quips and attitude and is far more genuine than the last series. All in all its a great film I thoroughly enjoyed it and found far superior to the new Batman that everybody seemed to love so much. Would definitely recommend it to anyone.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
With great power comes a not so great reboot,"Andrew Garfield takes the reins after Tobey Maguire's almost 10 year run of playing the iconic superhero. He plays Peter Parker, an orphan currently living with his uncles and trying to go through high school, until he is bitten by a radioactive spider and gets well, spider powers and becomes Spider-Man. He will have to face a great tragedy as well as a menacing threat that he himself has helped create.Joining him is Emma Stone, the currently 2 time Oscar winner (in less than 10 years by the way, oh wow!) as Peter Parker's love interest, Gwen Stacy, a science protege under the guidance of renounced scientist with one arm, Dr Curtis Connors (played by Rhys Ifans).Sally Field plays everyone's favorite Aunt May Parker. She clearly steals the spotlight with her strength, independence, sassyness and is adamant to her i won't take no ""bullshit"" behavior. Her aunt May is very different to Harris's from the classic Spider-Man movies but she still guides Peter and tries to understand and help him as she can.Martin Sheen plays Uncle Ben, Peter's favorite uncle and father figure. Denis Leary plays Captain Stacy, Gwen's father and captain of New York's finest, the NYPD.Having seen this movie in theaters when it was initially released, i was indeed fascinated and i of course really liked the movie. Big action scenes, emotional moments and a good CGI. But since then, i've come to realize that the movie has its negatives and is not as good as i remember it.The formula is the same but albeit very slow paced and almost every scene is filled with the movie's own soundtrack, which is good but it overtakes them and its use is at times very excessive. The movie is indeed pleasant but it moves extremely fast and it doesn't have those heartfelt and natural moments between the characters that the previous movies had.Garfield and Stone didn't and still don't pass the high school student niche but they are acceptable. They aren't forced but you also don't actually feel the connection that they have with the world and characters they live in and interact with. Their chemistry is acceptable.In the end, you certainly can't go back to what was but you certainly can begin again. This is what this movie is. It's not a great start but it holds its place thanks to the actors presence and perseverance to make this film still stand out on its own.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Incredible!! Can't Wait for more !!,"I'm extremely surprised that I am seeing so many awful reviews on this site and I really needed to created an account JUST so I can add my opinion to this review and hopefully be more of help.PLEASE NOTE: The Original Spider-Man movie (2002) has an IMDb rating of 7.4 and Spider-Man 2 has an IMDb rating of 7.5 and Spider-Man 3 has a 6.3 ... So far The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) has a 7.8 rating ... so anyone who says the ratings are lower than the originals shame on you! So, With that said ...WARNING: This MAY contain Spoilers!! You've BEEN WARNED!!...First and foremost let me state that the cast and crew really did a fantastic job bringing these characters to life. Andrew Garfield is a much better Peter Parker than Toby ever was, and I realize that now. Though I did enjoy the 1st and 2nd Spider-Man movies by Sam R. I will say that after watching this current rendition and actually looking back at the originals I was actually more bored with the Originals!! Everything looked and felt dated from the fighting, to the CGI, to the stale acting... Seriously Toby made Peter Parker look like a pale, cry baby, that always got weak in the knees about MJ, and Kirsten D. was NOT a very good MJ, a lot of the acting in those movies felt flat. However THIS cast really soars and the two incredible up and coming actors Garfield and Stone really really shine and their chemistry is FAR superior to anything Peter and MJ had in the Raimi movies.As for the Plot: SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING IT'S THE SAME MOVIE AS THE FIRST!??? ... This is REALLY not the case at all!!... Raimi's Spider-man took peter from 30 minutes of being in high school to the rest of the movie living in Manhattan and working for the daily bugle and attending college ... NONE OF THIS IS IN ""THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN""... This origin centers entirely with Peter living with his Aunt and Uncle and attending high school, he is a teenager, and he does not work for the Bugle. Also, though there are similar plot points (I counted anywhere between 4-5 similarities) everything was done with a twist, and even the dialogue was very different. When I expected the whole ""With great power comes great responsibility line"" I was pleasantly surprised that Uncle Ben never says that to this Peter, and says it in his own way that sounds less cheesy in my opinion and something that our own relatives would say to us while growing up and running into hard times. Even the way Uncle Ben dies is completely different (but the similarity does lie in the fact that Peter let's a thief go). And the set pieces are different as well (except for the bridge seen which IS in the original but then again like I said it plays out differently and I thought of it more as paying tribute to the original rather than trying to out shine it).And there are also little nods to the comics in the way Spidey's costume: he has mechanical web-shooters which is how it was originally intended in the comics, there is even a scene that shows Spidey in the sewer drain and trying to use the webs but it fails, which hints at the fact that Spider-man's weakness is being in WATER! And the way peter gets bitten by the spider is different as well and the circumstances surrounding it is completely different (hint: it's not a field trip). Basically, when this movie wanted to be similar it did it but with a twist, and when it wanted to be different it found ways of being different and telling a new story. (Comic books do this ALL the time, there are hundreds of re-tellings in the comic book world!)In addition, the villain is different, Gwen Stacey (Peter's first love NOT MJ) is here and they shine together (they react to one another like real teenagers do and I kind of got sent back to my youngin' days lol), the action is more fun and engaging (the IMAX 3D was incredible for this movie), and Spidey's smart-mouth-charm and finesse really comes out through Garfield's performance. The CGI is great too and is much more modern and fresh. I've heard complaints that the CGI is not very realistic and I was left dumbfounded at how someone could really think much of ANY CGI IS realistic!! The only quality CGI I've ever seen was in either the Lord of the Rings or Rise of the Planet of the Apes! And those movies were done by complete motion capture experts (Academy renowned too). And, comparing this movie to The Avengers is a bad call because The Avengers was an action explosion with superheroes that had their own movies and character developments before being thrown together (and by the way that CGI wasn't convincing either yet that movie is a hit anyway I digress).Look the point is, this movie is incredible, it is fresh, it is NOT the same as the first spider-man movie! It is more true to the comics than that movie was. With the great attention to character development, the charm, the emotion, and the fun that is portrayed I walked out of the theater wanting more! No matter what I, nor any one else says, you owe it to yourself to watch this film and make your own judgment.I really hope this review helps!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not Even A Movie,"It has truly come to the point where movies are no longer movies, only tools for making money. The ""Amazing"" Spider-Man is a perfect example. Leaving aside the problems in adapting the characters and stories for a transition in medium from comics to film, the movie simply doesn't work as anything but a marketing campaign. The makers of the film are clearly depending upon the viewing population's willingness to go see the sequel (already in progress), if not multiple sequels, in order to see a real story unfold. Any story that the movie does present is developed through abrupt and sloppy plot transitions, and so much is packed into the available 135 minutes that even a lifelong comic fan will leave the theater wondering who the characters were. The swinging effects were amazing, but of course, if you add money somewhere you must subtract it from somewhere else, and the effects for the Lizard were mediocre at best. My advice is to save this movie for Bad Blockbuster night on the couch, once it hits the redbox.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"My Spidey senses were tingling, but this film was surprisingly good","Okay, no one was more cynical than me when I heard the news that Hollywood was 'rebooting' Spiderman only a couple of years after Spiderman 3 was released. I thought it was a complete pointless waste of time. Tobey Maguire's version was so popular, I didn't see how it could be repeated.Yes, The Amazing Spiderman is a repeat, but, amazingly, it's not as bad as I thought. In fact, I almost enjoyed it more than the original.I read a lot of internet message boards which criticise BOTH versions from not staying truthful to the source material, i.e. the comics. But, seeing as I've never read any of those, I can't tell which one sticks closer. One of my main gripes with Tobey Maguire's version was that it felt a little too 'cartoony' with its bad computer-generated special effects and teen-choice feel.The Amazing Spiderman is also centred around high school kids (from what I knew of the comic, Peter Parker was a MAN, not a boy, but anyway...). However, the whole affair seems a lot darker. The Lizard is a good baddie to start off with. It would have been nice to see the (proper) Green Goblin (i.e. not just a man in a green suit of armour), but I'm guessing he'll crop up later on in the franchise.Andrew Garfield is a better hero than Maguire. Despite both playing teenagers, Garfield is also moody and darker, revelling in his newfound powers and even taunting his (lesser) enemies. It seems that the makers of this film looked at Christopher Nolan's Batman franchise with its 'flawed hero' mould and decided to borrow that style to make Peter Parker a little less 'squeaky clean.' My opinion: it was all the better for it.Yes, you cannot escape the fact that this film is basically the same one you probably watched ten years ago, but with a different cast. However, if you can get over that and accept that that's just how Hollywood rolls these days, you should enjoy it as a decent entry into the superhero genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Well Done!,"I must say, I didn't have much faith but was a bit excited just to know if they would be able to impress me with yet another Spiderman!

Two thumbs up for me, it was a wild ride 8-) Always love Emma Stone, although not as a blonde so much but she was a cute match for the movie. I had the opportunity to see Garfield in a movie called Never Let Me Go. So I knew that he would handle a part like this with ease. It took me a minute to get used to his smaller physic, not the muscular Toby Maguire but yuck who cares about him anymore *short cringe* I am happy that Marc Web was able to clean up such a pitiful excuse for a super hero movie blah ...

"The Franchise is back, but not Amazing as expected.","I won't tell the plot because you can found it on Wikipedia.My thoughts are:I think the problem was on script and continuities.1. What happened next with Irfan Khan? what's his role?2. Then if many objects were broken or stick with Peter's hand, why it didn't happen when he hug and kissed Gwen, or when he used his cellphone?3. If Webb wanted to make this Spidey being real as possible. But how come a teenager like Peter can make very complicated spidey suite and web shooter? OK he is diligent, but where he got the money to make such things? He isn't rich like Tony Stark or Bruce Wayne. Peter is from mid-low family. So it just like give a poor boy an Armani and try to make us believe that he buys it by himself. Ridiculous.4. What is the Lizard motives in his act? to make everyone being like him? After very long research, wasting money, time etc. How come he just want to give everyone ""free service"" ?5. Peter' motivation to be Spider-Man is really disgrace (in term of Superhero idealism) So Peter became Spider-Man, just want to find the murderer of Uncle Ben? Revenge? 6. When Lizard made a mess on the bridge, Spidey rescued a boy and it was good scene. But its ruined into pointless when Lizard ran away then Spidey wasn't chasing him, instead he met Gwen then he said he must stop the Lizard. 7. Its not logic , if a girl who just met a boy, just 2-3 times then they aren't a couple yet, then she invites that boy in family dinner.Andrew's acting as Spidey was very good. Even i think he can deliver Parker's emotion better than Tobey did. Andrew was amazing as Peter Parker in this movie more outspoken and bit of arrogant. Emma Stone was so so. Rhys Ifans was poor. Almost every villains in Superhero movies were delivered great acting and could play the audiences' emotion (ex: Ledger, Nicholson, Hackman, Spacey, Defoe, Molina etc) but somehow Ifans was less better, plain, and not total.The movie is quiet good. But, brought this Spidey into darker tone like Batman Begins to avoid being campy and real wasn't the answer. Spider-Man is not Batman. They are differentAs Spidey fanboy, i am happy that this reboot can extend the franchise. But not as Amazing as before. :'(",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The way it connects with the viewers makes it the BEST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE EVER MADE!,"For a concept that is familiar to everyone, they surely had to do what has not been done previously: Character-buildup. And that's where it scores so well.The brilliant action sequences, speedy screenplay and intelligent direction makes it look so grand that I can easily tag this as THE BEST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE EVER MADE.Andrew Garfield doesn't step into Tobey's shoes; he creates his own universe that makes Tobey forgettable. This spidey is swift , looks more intelligent and is equally vulnerable. A lot has been put to make this click, and you will never ever want to compare Tobey with him. Even if someone with you tries to do it, you would shut them off by saying, ""don't bring that up shh! Lemme watch this treat"" .The high point of this movie was the way it connects to the viewers. The sense of cooperation that is displayed by the citizens of NY City in the end, is what a super-hero movie should be about. They are simply not the onlookers, but when our spidey needed them the most, they contribute their efforts to help him(won't act as a spoiler, so I will shut it here) . The background score makes the final 20 minutes of the movie a superb experience.One forgivable low point would be the sheer need of keeping some aspects of the plot under shadows: Irrfan is definitely having some secrets as he keeps bossing around our Dr. Curt who is in the Cross Genetic research. I am hoping that he is coming back as the-- decide for yourself! And do sit through the first few minutes of the end credits.Overall: This movie surely calls for a multiple viewing in theaters, with convincing action and scintillating CGI, The Amazing Spider-man is an amazing form of entertainment!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good,"I liked 'The Amazing Spider-Man' and gave it a 6/10. Andrew Garfield delivered a charismatic performance as Spider-Man, but the film's writing didn't always do justice to his talent. The music was serviceable, though not particularly memorable. The casting was decent, with strong chemistry between Garfield and Emma Stone. Cinematography showcased some thrilling web-swinging sequences, but the direction and writing lacked the depth and originality seen in other Spider-Man adaptations. The film's strength lies in its modern take on the character and the dynamic between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, but it struggled with a formulaic plot and underdeveloped villains, making it a middling entry in the Spider-Man franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
great super hero movie,"When the spider-man reboot was announced I felt that it was for better only.First part of previous series was very good but than it was all south from there.As in most the cases in sequels,origin is always(mostly) exciting.Isn't it ?First of all after watching the movie I was very excited,happy,satisfied,may because exciting second half.So, I'll step back and try to review it.To start with the story was not something to write about it was all done and seen before,but the subtle things like romance and parker's struggle were beautifully shown.And same can be said about swinging and jumping over the city,which are by the way high points of the movie.I am not a big fan of 3D as the colors and picture looks dull but those scenes should be seen in 3d.Also lighter moments are funny and bring smilesActing is very good.Both the leads have done justice to the characters.Now what i didn't like or say less liked was the transition of peter parker to spider man was sort of rushed up.Its that part makes the First parts so good.Also the CG model of the lizard does not look good.When You see HULK,Na'vi, and then Lizard,it just not up to that.This might be minor thing to most people but not for me as i work in similar industry.Now as the title suggest,the amazing spider-man is a great superhero movie when you compare with other superhero movies or even with the original trilogy.I am not a big follower of comic book so i can't say anything from the front,but i loved the movie and will highly recommend and to my surprise,in 3D.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Along comes a new spider,"There really should be a time-limit on re-boots, in my opinion. I get that Spider Man is probably the best known Marvel Comics character and that this was their own reclaiming of him under their own banner, but I enjoyed the Raimi and McGuire tilt at old Spidey and didn't think that this re-make, despite some obvious changes, completely wiped away its too recent predecessors.I'm no expert on the comics front but the main changes I saw here were a different girl-friend for Peter Parker in the form of Gwen Stacey, played by Emma Stone, a different villain in The Lizard (Rhys Ifans) and no J Jonah Jameson or anything to do with the Daily Bugle. Otherwise it's the same old same old with another origin sequence, bullying scenes with Flash, the noble death of old Uncle Ben and another metamorphosing super-villain imperilling New York City.I did like Andrew Garfield, incidentally a double for tennis player Andy Murray, who plays a different kind of geek in Peter Parker than Tobey McGuire. He convincingly looks young enough in the part and I enjoyed the repartee his Spidey has with the villains he battles and the familiar wall-hanging poses he adopts throughout, just like the comics I remember. Gwen Stacey dresses a little oddly for a trainee scientist in knee-high socks and boots but Emma Stone acquits herself well as the hero's girlfriend who coincidentally is the daughter of the police chief (Denis Leary), who wouldn't you know it, despite the evidence of his own eyes and countless witnesses still can't differentiate do-gooder Spider Man from the evil Lizard.The SFX were excellent, especially all the web-slinging and web-swinging, with the big fight sequence at the end taking us all the way back to ""King Kong"" as a reference point. But was it better than the first Sam Raimi take on the character? The box-office returns would suggest not. I'll look out for the sequel from 2014, but wouldn't you know it, there's another re-boot around the corner later this year in ""Spider Man Homecoming"".Careful you don't squash this particular spider with your (re)boot Marvel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The only thing amazing was the amount of patience I had watching this,"What was wrong with this flick? I'm gonna say 7 out of 10 things, which is prolly why I gave this a 3 rating.Shortcomings -1. The intro was way too long to get Spidey started with his 'bag of tricks'2. The action sequences were few and far between3. This reminded me of a typical Bollywood movie with script you'll understand when you watch it (I beg you don't, though)4. Dr. Lizard... really?? I'm sure this is not what Stan Lee had in mind when he created him5. Andrew Garfield is better off playing the cat. Toby was far more convincing as Spidey6. BORINGGGGGGGG7. The latter part of the movie got me very restless, wanting it to end ASAPThe pluses -1. The special effects were good, although I don't think I saw all that was shown in the trailers2.

Worthy franchise starter.,"Everyone whinged like spoilt brats when Sony announced it was rebooting Spider-Man only 5 years after the Sam Raimi trilogy was completed. Those sooks need to eat their words: Marc Webb's film is a worthy franchise starter and one which is darker and more akin to the comics than the previous movies, without relinquishing the unbridled blockbuster fun that is synonymous with the webslinger. It's not remotely close to perfect – in fact it has a few notable flaws which stop it from surpassing Raimi's second instalment as the best Spidey flick yet – but what it lacks in a decent villain and a tightly wound narrative, it makes up for with superb central performances, great character development and some breathtaking action set-pieces that prove 3D can be used wisely. Easily the finest enhancement though is the leading duo of Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, playing Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey respectively. They nail the late-teen way of interaction and share a marvellous chemistry that keeps the picture afloat during a few of the duller patches the bloated runtime produces. We all know that there will be a sequel, the question is, can it elevate this new series into more memorable territory?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The romance drags down the movie,"I am a little ambivalent towards the movie. There are many good things in it. Like the part when Peter(played well by Andy Garfield) slowly begins discovering his powers and causes destruction at home. Or like the action scenes between the lizard and spider man which are very well done. Spider man here is funny. he talks to the policeman and occasionally also taunts the cops, just like in the comics. However, the movie devotes a large amount of time in the romantic scenes between Gwen Stacy and Parker which after a period of time just begin to drag the movie. The story is different in the beginning and there is the convergence only when Peter's uncle is killed. Rhys Ifans as the lizard is impressive. However, he does not hold a candle to even the lamest villain of Batman who are generally evil to their very core. Entertaining but not relentlessly so. A sincere effort but could have done much better with a shorter and tighter movie. 3 out of 5 for this.

"A solid winner, best spider man movie to date","In early summer 2007, Sam Raimi directed the 3rd and final film, Spiderman 3. With it's disappointment, Marc Webb,decided to retell the story in a different way. And it works. Should he have waited.Yes.Was it good.No. It was Great.Originally, I intended not to see this film, I was out of spider man. But it grew on me as its anticipation rose as well.The acting was incredible, the action was incredibleIf you haven't seen it, go now. I would also like to mention that if this was the untold story, then it would need more explanation in spider man 3.You'll see why when you see it",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not so amazing, Sony!","The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) was Sony's attempt to create a cinematic universe with this new iteration of Spider-Man and we all know how that went for them. Regardless of that, I watched this movie in theaters back in 2012 and I really enjoyed it. However after rewatching the movie for this review, I have to say that The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) is very mid.Positives for The Amazing Spider-Man (2012):
For me, Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker / Spider-Man and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy are fantastic and they have amazing on-screen chemistry with each other, not surprising given that these two were in a relationship during this time. I also loved Denis Leary as George Stacy and he was easily the best character in this movie as he wants to capture Spider-Man, but only because he feels that the police don't need anyone to do their job for them. I also really enjoyed both Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May. And finally, there are a number of action sequences throughout the movie that were a lot of fun to watch.Mixed for The Amazing Spider-Man (2012):
The Spider-Man Suit looks decent in this movie and it's not as bad as people make it out to be. However, the thing that does bother me is that Peter Parker is able to create mechanical web-shooters and not a great Spider-Man Suit, so I want to know why that is. Then, you have Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors / Lizard and I think he does a great job when he's Pre-Lizard Dr. Connors, but when he becomes the Lizard, he starts acting crazy in front of Peter Parker and it actually leads to Parker reporting him to Captain Stacy, so yeah great job with that Dr. Connors.Negatives for The Amazing Spider-Man (2012):
This movie plays out almost exactly like Sam Raimi's first Spider-Man movie with a couple of changes and it felt lazy. As I said in my intro, Sony Pictures was trying to create a cinematic universe with this new Spider-Man and their attempt to do that feels so forced in this movie and especially with The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014), but I'll get to that movie later. I didn't give a rats ass about this mystery regarding the disappearance of Peter Parker's parents. I didn't like that they were trying to connected everything towards Oscorp because it makes Spider-Man's origins less special and compelling. And finally, while I do think that Andrew Garfield is a better actor than Tobey Maguire, I didn't like his portrayal of Peter Parker because he is literally showing off his new abilities in front of a lot of people and even reveals his identity to some people for no reason. Speaking of that, I couldn't stand the fact that almost every character in this movie was acting so unbelievably stupid because when they do see Peter Parker using his powers in public, no one bothers to report and of it to the police.Overall, The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) is a very average take on this character and while I had some good things to say about it, I couldn't find myself to loving this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Different and better,"Going into this movie I was wondering what else they could do after all the recent Tobey and Kristen movies. I was pleasantly surprised it turned out to be different - more serious, with good acting and a compelling story that leads into a sequel.Andrew Garfield is a good actor if a bit mutant looking. He is quite good in the role. Emma Stone can play a wide range of ages and looks quite convincing as a high school student. She is more vulnerable and expressive than Kristen Dunst was in her role. Sally Field provides high quality supporting cast.The scenes of NYC and the swinging around are as good as can be expected.Liked it better than the Tobey versions. Looking forward to the sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Outstanding movie,"As far as genesis movies go, this one is fantastic. Furthermore, it completely trumps Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man. I'll admit I was skeptical of Andrew Garfield's ability to carry an iconic role like this one, but he did so beautifully. He was the right amount of dorky, funny, and serious, while giving a new feel to the Peter Parker character. I also loved the fact that Emma Stone was in this movie, and as Gwen Stacy at that. She always provides solid acting and natural charm.The writers and directors did a good job of providing a lot of true-to- the-story components in the film. It is tough to do a revamp of a film within a decade and have the guts to actually retell the story from scratch, but this movie did just that. Overall, there was an appropriate balance of plot, romance, and action, as well as a seamless flow from beginning to end. Lastly, I was thoroughly entertained with Spider-Man's new fighting style. His movements were much sharper and present than in the past, but graceful and fluid when they needed to be. As a serious movie-goer and longtime comic book fanatic, this movie got it right.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Cringy and clunky,A lot of forced transitions which makes me feel not in the moment. It felt like everything was shortened. The scores were also not to my liking. Felt like theres so many different scores to process the moment when in the end I cannot empathise with the moment. Not to mention the obvious product placement by Sony throughout the movie. The acting was pretty good with significant touches of cringeworthy moments in my view.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A senseless and a pathetic Movie,"I just came from the Movie and guess what I am writing this. I have see all the previous Spiderman movies and this is the worst of all. I am happy I said that. I had to fight with my friend for 3 days who kept on postponing the movie until today I didn't figure out that this would turn of to be a waste of time and Money.What should I say! awful, Brainless and time wasting move. I did find any sense in this movie. I missed a Good story and serious Action in this Movie. The hero and the villain share the same smile. Adding to this the movie has some serious loopholes like the disappearance of Irfan Khan who is not to be seen after the fight on the bridge, the character who killed uncle Ben are not to be seen. I thought this movie would answer the questions regard spider mans parents disappearance but the movies takes its own course and leads to somewhere.I will not suggesting this movie to any of my friends.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It really is that Amazing.,"I've read about 40 reviews on here and it seems that most of them are voted down a bit because it's not the old Spiderman movies. That's the point.If you're a fan of the real Spidey from the Comics than you probably thought the original trilogy was a disaster. I love that he's a gadgeteer again like he should be. He's a genius, a smart ass...and don't forget, he's just a kid.None of this was forgotten this time around. I have seen it 4 times now, it gets better with every view. I can't wait for round 2 of the reboot so I can get that much closer to completely forgetting the original trilogy which made a mockery of Spidey with bad acting, a poor choice of an actor, and seriously...no web shooters?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Really underrated version of Spider-man,"It's crazy how many people think this movie isn't comparable to Tobey Maguire's version of Spider-man. While it may not be as action packed as the initial Sam Raimi Trilogy, this movie literally brought out every small aspect of Peter Parker's life and the challenges he faced to become the hero we all love, making it the most accurate interpretation of the character we've seen so far. The swinging scenes, CGI, suit, plot and the powerful acting of Andrew Garfield and the rest of the crew, it's just mesmerizing!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another generic Remake of the original,"When I watched this movie for the first time I thought it was a pretty good movie, meanwhile I watch it again in 2019 and this movie is just so bland and forgettable of spidey film, overall I think it's okay but i would definitely not recommend it when you can watch the fun Spider-Man (2002) film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Andrew Garfield > Toby Maguire,"Unpopular opinion: All these years later (in 2022), this series holds up so much better than the original trilogy. I used to love the originals. But I now find them harder to watch, with forced relationship drama, dour scenes and a slow pace. MJ is less likeable with every viewing. And it sadly feels outdated.This series has a much more likeable Peter Parker with a severely underrated performance by Andrew Garfield. Gwen Stacy isn't just likeable, she's lovable. And she's not a useless damsel like MJ. She's important to the story. And they have one of my favorite romances. The movie does a great job of making you care about the love story and pulling on your heart strings.And of course, the Spider-Man-ing itself is so much cooler in this movie. And while the benefit of technology is obvious, I'm more impressed with the creativity. So many awesome uses of his abilities in creative ways. The fighting moves he uses are so cool. There are so many beastly scenes that represent Spider-Man well. (6 viewings, 1/31/2022)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spiderman: The RETOLD Story is enjoyable with plenty of heart but just not fresh enough,"I enjoyed this, it offers just about enough to set it apart from Raimi's trilogy but I didn't feel there was anything really outstanding about it. There are no moments in the film which made me go, oh wow. If it was a decade ago, I might have but not today, now that we are saturated with CGI effects movies. It simply moves along amicably with spots of charm, a tiny bit of humour, plenty of teenage angst and a heavy dose of anger all of which is framed within a washed out dark toned colour palette as opposed to the vibrancy and rich colours of Raimi's trilogy.There are some decent big action set pieces but they lack invention and none of it has the visceral energy and savviness as say Avengers or Raimi's trilogy...oops, you know I did promise myself not to make comparisons to Raimi. But I cant help it. So much of the this film is a retread of 2002 Spider-Man and Spiderman 2 that I simply cant ignore it. You really have to be patient with going through all the blasted exposition again. And not just that but an all too similar journey of Octavia as well, albeit in the form of a Lizard. Having said that, it IS all done well, there is plenty of heart and the performances are sincere. Andrew Garfield is born for the role, he is a major reason for watching this film. I always felt the wrong actor won the best actor award in Social Network. Should have been Garfield! But anyway, he nails Peter Parker's flippancy, geekiness, and angst perfectly. His awkwardness and playful relationship with Gwen Stacy are some of the highlights of the movie for me. Emma Stone gives Gwen an attractive spark despite ultimately not differing too much to the Mary Jane of Raimi's films but Gwen has more geek in common with Parker and a little more brains too.One of the areas this film disappoints in is dialogue. Not that its bad, it just lacking some spark. There is a couple of quips from Spiderman but nothing more and if you've seen the trailers, you've heard most of them. Its the only thing I'm actually disappointed with the Spiderman character himself because otherwise I love this version of the web slinger, he is a lot more vulnerable and less all round powerful than Raimi's version. I also see the benefit now of having the separate electronic web slinger narrative wise, as Spidey depends on it, if it fails, our hero is in trouble...I like that extra vulnerability, we feel more anxious for Spiderman here, can he really cope with the mighty dangers ahead? That's all done well.The Lizard is pretty good but all too similar to Octavious in terms of motive and character and the effects are seamless. But I have to make comparisons again. The Dr Connors/Lizard is a paler version of Octavious in Spiderman 2 who was by far the more superior and complex villain. The Connors/Lizard character is a not given enough depth for us to empathise with or even fear for that matter.The soundtrack is serviceable, there is no standout theme for Spiderman, well there is but its a bit meh, certainly not James Horners best work.Storywise this film lacks imagination and seems too frightened to take risks somehow. It introduces a mystery but then completely abandons it and only returns to it midway through the end credits! The rest of the story is simply old themes already covered in previous films. The Untold story? More like The Retold Story. Whatever we get of this untold story, is absolutely minimal and I get the feeling its meant to be a story arc which might be spread over perhaps a trilogy of these movies.I know I've emphasised the film's negative points but I did still enjoy what it had to offer and to be honest, most of you might prefer this to Raimi. If Raimi's spider-man is milk chocolate then this is the dark chocolate version.I'd still look forward to a sequel but I'll say this, I don't have an urge to see this again. With films such as Avengers, X-Men:FC, Spiderman 1, 2 and yeah even 3, I have an urge to see them again or at least anticipate watching it again on Blu Ray. Unfortunately I have no such urge with this film.These are my personal comparison ratings for all the Spiderman films in this millennium:Spider-man 9/10 Spider-man 2: 9/10 Spider-man 3: 7.5/10 (yeah I had blast with this one, to hell with the haters ) The Amazing Spiderman: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Improvement and more problems,"Your boyfriend is a man with many masks. He's Bug Boy.Now it's time for Andrew Garfield as the new Peter Parker. I'll compare this to the first Sam Raimi's Spider-Man as it changed quite a bit of things.First of I liked that there's more background to Peter's parents. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man didn't give any clues about his parents, but Amazing Spider-Man made this one of the big part of the story. It didn't reveal much, but I guess I had to wait until the second one to know more about his parents.Another improvement was the suit and how it was made. In Sam Raimi's, the suit just popped up outta nowhere without any motivation behind the design. This one answered all of that and not only was the suit cleaner, it also felt more personal to Peter.Andrew Garfield. Man he is such a phenomenon. He added a different quirk to the character of Peter and made the character more charismatic than the script did. Also, Emma Stone was just lovely as the new love interest. I'm not gonna lie, I didn't like the way they fell in love (Sam Raimi's made more sense), but I still dig the relationship because the actors looked so well together.My biggest problem was just how similar the stories were between this one and Sam Raimi's. It's basically a reshuffling of the plots into a single movie. Also, Gwen Stacy was nowhere as interesting as MJ, and this stemmed from the script that could have done the characters better. Lastly, the new villain wasn't anything special, and just on par with Green Goblin.Overall, it's a decent movie with both improvements and problems. 7-7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great acting, lacks a strong villain","Garfield is the best Peter Parker out there. And Emma Stone is so ever fantastic.The plot is good, with a solid exposition and character developement BUT the film´s villain is really weak (not in this body but rather in the way he was written). Lame and weak.The directing is pretty good and the technology used is convincing.Has aged well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good film but it should have been called ""The Amazing Peter Parker""","It is clear from the trailers that The Amazing Spiderman is cutting off all ties with the old silly Spiderman 3 with a new, more serious Spidey. Of course everyone will be comparing this to Sam Raimis take on the wall crawler so re-telling the origin story of the young college student Peter Parker needs to be fresh yet familiar. So does Spiderman swing to new heights or does it get washed away like a spider in the bath?The Amazing Spiderman echoes the plot threads of Sam Raimis Spiderman with the origins of these unusual powers which Peter obtains and how peter recklessly uses them for selfish gain and then thanks to his Uncle Ben Peter atones his powers to become a hero rather than a vigilante. What Marc Webb emphasises in his version of Spiderman Peter Parkers struggles having mysteriously lost his parents, having a tough time at school and losing his uncle. This fleshes out Peter with the first act introducing the insight to the struggles he carries even before he becomes Spiderman. But in the few moments we see Peter in the iconic costume the film doesn't know what to do with its self and the film swings (if you would pardon the pun) from one story arc to another making everything feel less connected.The performance from Andrew Garfield is defiantly the highlight of the film. I can't believe the guy is 28 years old he looks like a teenager so he pulls of the look as well as the portrayal of his introduction from a typical ruff day at school to worrying his aunt and uncle with his odd behaviour. Garfield conveys Peter similar to Maguire accept more restrained in his awkwardness and perhaps more timid which makes him a captivating brainy character who keeps himself to himself. One of my favourite scenes from the film which is in the 4 minute trailer is when Spiderman is saving a little boy and throws him his mask and says it would make him stronger this emphasises the humanity of Peter Parker and is a very suspenseful and touching scene. It's just a same there isn't more scenes where Spiderman is being Spiderman. Sally Field and Martin Sheen who play Peter's Aunt and Uncle are very versatile characters who play the kooky yet concerned guardians. Of course the same tragic events occur just like in the 2002 Spiderman accept with a rather different outcome.Other performances, that leave less of an impact would be Emma Stone as the brainy Gwen Stacy. Her portrayal was nothing great nor nothing terrible it's just a little dull how there are breaks in the action for a scene about coco. The romance isn't as developed then the first Spiderman also and is blended in well with the other plot points in that movie. Rhys Ifans who plays Doctor Connors is also a rather one dimensional villain they try and make him interesting by throwing in that he's got schizophrenia at the last minute but it's too little too late. Plus I found the effects on the Lizard to be more cute then threatening with that permanent smile on his face he looks like the snake from The Jungle Book.Marc Webb also doesn't fully utilise the vistas that New York has to offer it is also a lot more domestic then the 2002 Spiderman. The soundtrack is also lacklustre and distracting and at times it doesn't complement the scene but it's only a minor nitpick.Overall The Amazing Spiderman has now got everything setup for hopefully a worthwhile sequel where we get to see Spiderman doing what a Spider can. It's slightly annoying that we must sit threw another tiresome and somewhat predictable origin story but Marc Webb just barely manages to keep things fresh with his leading man Andrew Garfield pulling it off. Out of all the superhero films that are coming out this summer The Avengers is for those who are looking something larger than life and straightforward, The Dark Knight Rises is for the Drama and the psychological battle as well as the physical one and The Amazing Spiderman is for people looking for a coming of age story with someone who has everyday problems along with supernatural problems thrust upon them. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just plain awful!,"Just been to the movie and the movie was just as predictable & boring as expected. It lacked in every department from the highly predictable storyline to the stale acting to the poor humour which strangely some people found funny.I do wonder if directors nowadays have any creative bone in the body to maybe have a bit spontaneity in the movie instead of regurgitate every scene in the movie.I do wonder if the lack of quality storyline & over excessive action scenes has to do with trying to make as much money as possible to entice the lowest common denominator.I do wonder how people in movie theater are so easily amused that they they must have laughed on 10 different occasions when in reality they where actually hardly any funny scenes.I do wonder how easily pleased people are that a movie like this get's a rating of 7.6 when it has mediocrity written all over it.To finish it off if you want great acting, storyline, humour, chemistry, or any great adjectives to describe a movie then this is not the movie for you!",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The Not-so amazing spider-man, but far from a terrible effort.","FIrstly, I think it's fair to say that, whilst I love the Marvel universe, I am by no means a hardcore fan. With that said, however, I still can't help but feel a little disappointed by The Amazing Spiderman.Directed by the suitably named Marc Webb, TAS falls somewhat short of expectations for a viewer. Perhaps this is due to the fact that it immediately follows The Avengers, which set the bar impossibly high for superhero movies, or perhaps it is the fact that, for a Superhero movie, it is sorely lacking in the key parts- a memorable villains, exciting action sequences, a moral dilemma.Rhys Ifans is a very talented actor, and his role here is a suitably written comic book villain, but in the Spiderman universe, The Lizard is not a particularly stand-out nemesis. With that in mind, the Gwen Stacy storyline is a much more believable love story than that of the Mary Jane one from the Sam Raimi efforts, and Andrew Garfield shares real chemistry on screen with her. The main problem is that Marc Webb is more effective at the romance scenes than he is at the action sequences. Whilst the fight scenes are entertaining enough, they simply don't hold the screen, and they are quickly forgotten. The original trilogy, directed by Sam Raimi, was packed full of memorable fight scenes which have stood the test of time. This movie is a solid effort, but it simply does little other than entertain, and it simply doesn't hold it's own alongside some of the other Marvel films.Ultimately, it is a little confused by what it wants to be. The love element of the story is handled respectfully but the action sequences, whilst far from terrible, do not hold the audience's attention as much as should be expected.You can't blame Sony for digging up the Spider-Man franchise for a reboot, as to this day it remains one of their most lucrative projects, but you also can't help but feel that this was an unnecessary addition to the Marvel Universe. Frankly, had The Avengers not been so fantastic, this film would still have been lacking that final spark. It's not poor- it just falls short of the hype that was surrounding it.The Spider-Man isn't so amazing, after all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
With great power comes great responsibility.,"Superhero reboot of the original Spider-Man trilogy of films produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Entertainment, directed by Marc Webb and written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves. In this new start, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is a shy and socially awkward but intelligent New York high school student who has been living with his uncle and aunt Ben and May Parker (Martin Sheen and Sally Field) since his parents Richard and Mary Parker (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz)'s mysterious deaths when he was a child. Whilst investigating mysteries regarding his late father's work in cross-genetics at scientific research organisation Oscorp, Peter is bitten by a genetically altered spider and gains newfound spider-like abilities including superhuman strength, heightened senses, agility, and speed. After his uncle Ben is killed by a criminal which Peter could have prevented if he had used his new abilities for good, he takes on the alter-ego of masked superhero Spider-Man to find his uncle's killer and to avenge his death, bringing Spider-Man to the attention of police captain George Stacy (Denis Leary), whom does not appreciate an unconstituted individual doing the crime fighting that he feels should only be the preserve of those established by law to prevent crime and civil disorder. But when for conscience's sake Peter's late father's friend and colleague at Oscorp Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) injects himself with a serum that Peter helped him create and is mutated into rampaging and unstoppable humanoid reptile the Lizard and becomes the enemy of the city and indeed the whole world, Spider-Man just might be New York - and humanity's - last hope.A competent superhero movie. Andrew Garfield is definitely my favourite actor out of the three actors to have played Spider-Man out of the three sets of movies, as I liked his portrayal of Peter Parker / Spider-Man best. Although some of the comic book mythology has been changed (Spider-Man has no 'spider sense' and his uncle Ben never utters the immortal line 'With great power comes great responsibility' that leads Peter Parker to become Spider-Man in the Marvel Universe), this is still a well done job. Andrew Garfield makes for a sympathetic and likeable Peter Parker, a young man trying to find his way in life whom is an orphan being raised by his uncle and aunt whom just happens to have incredible powers. As usual, Spider-Man's love life is one of the best things about a Spider-Man movie, with in this case a great romance between Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker and Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy (also the daughter of police captain George Stacy (Denis Leary)), whom Parker confides in. With the themes of the place of power in society - is Spider-Man a hero or a vigilante? -, conscience leading to action (Peter Parker and Dr. Curt Connors become hero and villain due to both following their moral sense of right and wrong) and enjoyable action sequences as Spider-Man tussles with his foe the Lizard, this was largely exactly what was asked for. However, I felt that the stakes didn't feel high enough in the climax to the movie - no end of the world here - for the movie to warrant four or more stars. Still, a good movie, which I put in a good word for.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Amazing Spider-Man (2012),"Nearly on par with Raimi's Spider-Man 2 with a familiar outline from Raimi's first Spider-Man, The Amazing Spider-Man holds its own among the franchise as a charming and emotional rendition and focuses on what truly matters most. First off, I just thoroughly enjoy the look of this film, it's very unique full of cool-blue colors and the CGI is just incredibly well done for the time. Andrew Garfield may not be the best actor to take on the role as the web-slinging hero, but he certainly makes the character his own, and for me truly encaptures what it means to be Spider-Man himself. His performance as Peter Parker may not match Maguire's or Holland's just as Maguire's doesn't quite match Garfield's charm as Spidey- but he truly does hold his own and provides a refreshing new take on the character we hadn't quite seen on screen before. Besides focusing on just Garfield as Spider-Man there are many other great actors throughout the film as well, including but not limited to: Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, Rhys Ifans and Dr. Curt Connors, and the amazing Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben (an absolute perfect casting choice). The story can be a bit too familiar for its own good at times, and its final battle scenes can be a bit too formulaic and predictable. It has its tonal flaws every now and then, but for the most part, it's much darker than other iterations in the past, and I quite enjoyed a more serious brutal take on the character and the look of it throughout. In the end, The Amazing Spider-Man is far from perfect- but it does manage to hold its own and have enough charm to spare. It may not be the best film of the titular hero, but it certainly makes for a fun ride.My Rating: 8.4/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Almost there...,"It's obvious that the filmmakers looked to the successes that were the first two Nolan Batman films and tried to imitate the darker, more grounded tone that they embraced. However, Sony made the wrong move in doing so and failing to understand that Spider-Man is not a dark character.One of my problems with this film is that it doesn't really feel like a Spider-Man film; it feels like Peter just takes up the mantle of Spider-Man out of nowhere and doesn't really fulfil what it means to be a hero. What troubles me even more is that Spider-Man is conceived out of revenge; the writers made Peter Parker go to the effort of creating the full Spider-Man suit and web-shooters for the purpose of Peter getting his vengeance on his Uncle Ben's killer, no.The action scenes get quite dull (especially due to Horner's unforgettable score throughout the film), the crane scene at the end was a little cheesy for my liking, the Lizard could have had a lot more potential (especially if they had introduced Connors' family) and the film just fails to capture the true essence of Spider-Man.Why the high-ish rating then? The cast is great and disregarding this as a ""Spider-Man"" movie, characters are believable and each actor/actress really brings their role to life. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone share wonderful chemistry together and the Peter/Gwen romance is the highlight of this film, trumping the dull relationship between Peter and Mary Jane in Raimi's trilogy. One of my favourite moments from the film was the bridge scene in which Spider-Man saves a young boy trapped in a burning car, hanging off the side of the bridge. Andrew Garfield's charisma comes through a lot here and it's that interaction between him and the young boy that makes his iteration of Peter Parker likable, more so than Tobey Maguire in Raimi's trilogy who often came across as a little too dull and lifeless.I really want to like ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" but the material and storytelling is average, suffering from having to go through the origin again and having little justification for doing so, especially with the untold story about Peter's parents which is never fully resolved and just gets swept under the rug as the film progresses. The film tries too hard to copy the grittier tone led by The Dark Knight and is consciously trying to separate itself from the Raimi films rather than being its own thing, resulting in a poor execution for a Spider-Man film. That being said, I have watched this film multiple times because of the excellent cast making it worth sticking around for the 2 hr runtime. Andrew Garfield makes for a promising Peter Parker and Spider-Man (despite the poor material he's had to work with) and Emma Stone shines as the strong female lead and love interest Gwen Stacy. If it wasn't for the cast, then this film would most likely get 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider-Man without Tobey is like LOTR without Elijah Wood,"Okay..I know the movie has a new franchise and whatnot, I've read enough on it, but let's be honest here: Andrew Garfield IS NOT Spiderman. In fact, no one but Tobey Maguire is truly Spiderman. The way the hero is portrayed in the new version is nothing but awful compared to the amazing work of Tobey on the first three movies. I am not diminishing Garfield as an actor at all, in fact, I do like him, but it sickens me to see that they have chosen someone other than Tobey to play our beloved Spidey. Also, let's not ignore the fact that Kirsten Dunst is MJ, and not even Emma Stone can do a better job at it than Kirsten. I can't wrap my head around that fact. Now, lets talk about the movie itself...the fight scenes are like 5 seconds long, and although the graphics are pretty decent, the content itself leaves you wanting more. Or in my case, it made me wonder why anyone would ever spend money on that movie. The whole thing is more about him being ""the cool nerd"" who gets the girl rather than the struggles he encounters along the way, which is what the first three movies with Tobey are about. Lastly, allow me to ask you this: can you imagine Lord of the Rings without Elijah Wood being Frodo? I don't think so. Can we imagine anyone else being Harry Potter but Daniel Radcliff himself? Absolutely not. What about Wolverine (X-Men) not being played by Hugh Jackman? How weird would that be? Yeah...nothing else I can say about the subject.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What exactly was the point of redoing SPIDER MAN?,"This is going to be the easiest review i have ever written.Considerably better cast taken on to portray the characters, one clearly see the difference. Andrew Garfield excels in the titular role and gives an impression Tobey Maguire was never able to give.The problem with the movie was that i could not help think why make such a repetitive movie with same story, twists and turns. I knew what was going to happen throughout the film which disappoints exponentially. I sincerely expected that if the makers were daring to redo spider-man again, they must have something different for a change, but i was proved wrong in the first half an hour of the movie.Had this been the start of the trilogy which would have been released before the previous trilogy, i would have said the movie was really good and effectively made but now, it was totally forgettable and a waste of money to produce the same stuff again and again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A reboot that really was't necessary, and the amazing spider-man where was he i just found one in sam riami's film.","This review may contain spoilers.A great franchise did it really require a reboot???frankly I did love the dark tone of the film really justifying and very logical the way it goes unlike the previous Spiderman trilogy. its interesting the way plots where,lined and Andrew garfield gets bit by a radioactive spider at oscorp the movie was so logic unlike it was't so stupid as the previous spider man.Andrew garfield he really justifies the role of Spiderman young and energetic and gwen stacy very pretty serving as spideys love interest, I really loved the dark tone and the plot. And truly a very logical interesting story.BUT now wait where is the amazing Spiderman, where is that amazing factor why is the film so dark why doesn't Spiderman appear in day light , what happened to his spidey suit he looks more like a man in a robber mask then a spidey suit... The suit was completely dark it was so clear till end that you do see a Spiderman..the villain was good corners as lizard... But still I do agree the,first spider man was not,logical neither darker but seriously it had that amazing factor it kept u entertained for next 2 hours, the wow moments when the building catches those stunts still stand in your mind, such sequences aren't in the amazing Spiderman the wow factor is missing.I agree I love the story but the screenplay did lag and it was't well executed. Other than that I felt the casting was the best every one justified to,there roles Andrew garfield simply is the friendly neighbour good.so before we wrap, I did like the film but I didn love it did drag, The amazing Spiderman at all, it did miss the wow factor which Spiderman carries.. Kudos to a darker and a realistic story line but a bit weakly executed screenplay hopefully we can expect something amazing from the sequel, I personally feel a reboot was't required yet..",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Refreshing start after Tobey's trilogy.,"Don't get me wrong - Tobey's movies, in particular Spider Man 2 - are great. Andrew is one of my favorite actors, and out of all the spider men is the one I'd be friends with if I could have the choice. His attitude when he comes out of his shell (in the suit) is funny, witty, and adorable. This movie is far from perfect, but I finished the movie satisfied, ultimately. The script could have been better, and there is no new shocking deep revelations to who Spider Man is, but Andrew presents a likeable character, that you want to win in the end. An imperfect movie that stole my heart.(For reference, I saw Tom Hollands trilogy and Tobey's trilogy before I watched this movie).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great reboot, but maybe a bit too soon","This is a very nice reboot of the series and I will be seeing the next one (in 2014 I think), I like the change of scenery, enemies and the story in general, but I am not sure if I like this or the ""old"" Spiderman the best, they each have very nice qualities.This is certainly entertaining and action packed just as much as the series before, and yes they maybe skip ahead a bit because we all ready know how Spidey came to be, but the Connor side is very good and actually better then the first movie of the series before.I think a reboot is too soon, but never the less this is a good one and you should see, enjoy and be amazed :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Could have done so much more,"I'm gonna be absolutely clear with this one - I absolutely love this interpretation of Spider-Man, except for the fact that he occasionally doesn't act like him. And I really wanted to like this movie. I played its game and it was really fun. But the movie, well, let's just say it had a lot of potential.Finally Peter Parker is shown to always have a passion for photography. He's beaten up for not taking a picture of a bully bothering a schoolmate. If I were him I'd have taken a picture and shown it to the Principal and gotten that bully suspended, but let's assume this Peter Parker isn't as bright. Later he visits Oscorp, gets bitten by the spider and becomes Spider-Man.I really like how they showed Spider-Man slowly turning into Spider-Man. In the beginning he is unable to understand why he has all these powers, then he starts seeing everything is sticking to him and he reacts on his own. Afterwards he is upgrading his suit accordingly to suit the needs. He makes his own device to shoot webs. The Sam Raimi trilogy had convinced anyone who didn't read the comics that Spider-Man's webs come out of his body, but it's not true. This movie clarified it.The main antagonist of this movie is Lizard. As someone who has read the original The Amazing Spider-Man comic where Spider-Man encounters Lizard for the first time, I can guarantee you that that story should have been used here. It was way better than the ""Spider-Man finds enemy in the gutter"" plot. In the comic he goes to the jungles in Florida and finds Dr Curt Connor's family over there. Also originally Dr Connors used to DRINK the medicine to become Lizard, not inject it. I don't see why he'd choose to go by the more painful method.And of course Uncle Ben dies. But unlike Spider-Man he didn't die in a climactic moment. He just died of his own stupidity. And later on no one gives a damn about his death. It doesn't make any difference at all.The Amazing Spider-Man is an underexplored idea that should have been using a lot more stories than it did. Rather than entire squishing everything in the sequel, this should have added one more concept from the sequel, more preferably establishing that Peter and Harry were friends. That would have given content to this movie and made the sequel more convincing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not Bad At All,"Like The Raimi Versions This One Was Just As Good But I Do Have Points That Are Negative ... 1) Uncle Ben Never Gets Around To Telling Peter That ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"" This Is The Single Epiphany Of Any Hero/Good Guy And The Founding Stone Of Who Peter Parker Goes On To Be ... 2) Since In This Movie A Lot Of Work Went Into The Stacy Story Line I Would Have Like To Have Seen It Play Out The Way It Did On The Comics When I Read About The Death Of Captain Stacy ... I Will Never Forget His Words ""Please God Let Me Not Be Late"" (Those Who Read Amazing Spider-man #90 Know) ... Otherwise The Special Effects Were Done Well ... Acting Was On Par With The Other 3 Movies And Marc Webb Did An Excellent Job Directing",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worst Spider Man,"Marc webb is definitely the worst director of this summer.The movie is seriously lacks in every thing, Direction, story, Action, screenplay.First of all why didn't they focus more on Peter's dad history, what's the reason that his story was left alone on the first place. They movies lacks in holding down audience attention, during the mid-way of the movie, I almost got fed up, that i wanted to leave the movie in between.The ending is the worst, there is no big action sequence like the previous movies. Ending is definitely the weakest point of this movie. The charters have no mutual connection, they characters are soulless and andrew(peter) doesn't look in any shape to be a science geek.SFX were good.The movie also leaves behind the Peter's private and professional side, such as his photography and his arrogant editor.What happened to irfan khan character. This movie is filled with flaws.Final verdict Don't see this movie It is a waste of your money, better wait for the avengers DVD 2/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A fresh take on the web-slinger,"""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" directed by Marc Webb, offers a new spin on the beloved superhero's origin story. Andrew Garfield stars as Peter Parker, a teenager who gains extraordinary abilities after being bitten by a genetically modified spider. The film delves into Peter's quest to uncover the truth about his parents' mysterious disappearance while embracing his new identity as Spider-Man.Garfield's portrayal of Peter is a refreshing change, bringing a more modern and nuanced take to the character. Emma Stone shines as Gwen Stacy, Peter's intelligent and spirited love interest, with the chemistry between the two adding depth to the film. Rhys Ifans delivers a compelling performance as Dr. Curt Connors, whose transformation into the Lizard provides a formidable antagonist for Spider-Man.Visually, the film excels with impressive action sequences and stunning special effects, especially during Spider-Man's web-slinging scenes through New York City. However, the plot occasionally feels derivative, and the pacing can be uneven.Overall, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is an entertaining reboot with strong performances and exhilarating action, though it struggles to fully distinguish itself from previous iterations.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A different spin,"Despite the obvious big budget trappings, there's almost something ""indie"" about director Marc Webb's 'The Amazing Spider-Man'. From its cinematography to its tone, this is very much a Tribeca Spider-Man.The lanky Andrew Garfield physically embodies Peter Parker perfectly, and though his twitchy, mumbley emo kid take on the character takes some getting used to, he makes it work. His love interest and real life girlfriend Emma Stone have good chemistry together, which is important since their character's romance is handled rather clumsily at times. The rest of the cast fill in around them okay, but are given little to do except function as window dressing.The film's biggest weakness is its inability to fuse its indie, character driven sensibilities with big budget summer popcorn thrills. The action and stakes all lack the epic quality necessary to take this otherwise well made take on the Spider-Man mythos to the next level.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Not As Great As The First Two Films In Raimi's Series, But Still Good Fun","I really want to give this a 6.5, but as we can only do straight numbers, I'll round up. I remember when I first saw Raimi's Spiderman. There were few films like it, a high flying, greatly produced comic book film that, even more than X-Men, created a legitimate tale about a teenager getting superpowers. It was like few films I had seen before and it really got the ball rolling on the superhero genre. Yes, there were films before it that did the superhero thing, but Spiderman was different. It had a certain feeling to it, a certain oomph those other films didn't have.Sadly, Amazing Spiderman doesn't have that. Now, don't get me wrong, this is a good film. Garfield delivers a great performance, as does the rest of the cast, and there are some nice additions here that even the original three films didn't have. But, that aforementioned oomph isn't there. Now, maybe we've just become so inundated with superhero films, maybe it's the shadowing of Avengers, or maybe it's because this film comes only a few years after the last Spiderman film, but there's something missing here. Where the first two films had a great spectacle and pizazz to them, Amazing Spiderman lacks that. Where there was a somewhat campy, somewhat cliché, somewhat fantasy-like performance to Maguire's performance, and the film overall for that matter, Amazing seems to play it fairly straight. Of course, they need to keep it fresh, so new factors are added, like the thankful choice of replacing Mary Jane with Parker's first real love, Gwen Stacy. There's also, obviously, some humor, because what is Spiderman without the humor. But the overall tone is so serious at times, that it becomes unintentionally funny.The film is also, I think, unintentionally bland. We don't actually see Spiderman for a good hour into the film, when Peter finally dons the trademark costume. I was continually looking at the time because the beginning just drags and drags, as if we've forgotten already from the first film who Peter Parker is and how he becomes Spiderman. I love Peter Parker's back story and his origin story is one of my favorites of any Marvel hero, but the Peter Parker here is just so normal that it's hard to find it all that interesting. Where Maguire's Parker was the animated, comic book geek, the kind I like to see in Peter Parker, here, he's just a loner who goes through a typical high school outcasts life.Now, I did give the film a 7, and so there are obviously good things about it. The Peter and Gwen story is good. Garfield and Stone are terrific, especially together, and Stone stands out as the near perfect superhero love interest, as she plays the part to her strengths being funny, sweet, vulnerable, as well as strong willed. In fact, pretty much the entire cast is good, including Rhys Ifans, who plays a similar villain to Doctor Octopus in Spiderman 2. The action scenes are also quite entertaining. While they were good in the original series, the mix of special effects, camera movement, and focus are fantastic here. Though, I would still argue that Spiderman 2 has the best action of the entire series. This film, however, gives hope that the next installments in the series will prove to have even better action.Though Amazing Spiderman doesn't top the performance of the first two films, it is a lot of fun. It's not without flaws, but solid action and solid acting make it worthwhile.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Sally Field looked like a beggar, and her character was very close to non existent.I simply can't understand why anybody would like this movie. I don't even know where to start...

I'm certainly not a fan of Tobey McGuire, but Andrew Garfield is a far worse choice for even Peter Parker, not to say for Spiderman in costume.Please avoid this film.

Scientist Dr. Curt Connors played by Rhys Ifans is working with the same spiders to research cross species genetics. Dr. Connors uses a non-human tested serum to try and regenerate his lost arm.

This movie impressed me with great take on peters origin story, the relationship between pete and gwen, but the scenes in the city is what made me love this even more, the cgi was great and looked so damn real, and the classic spidey poses game straight from the comics. Don't listen to all these bad reviews, watch it for yourself if you're a superhero fan and i guarantee you'll love it",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Indeed amazing with a large dose of CGI and long runtime.,"It is very understandable why Sony Pictures got the idea of adding the word amazing for the next Spidey film. Probably because Sam Raimi, the director of the previous films gave up for a fourth film. Now in the helm of (500) Days of Summer director Marc Webb, the new Spider-Man gets its new magic touch.Webb was also given an opportunity to direct Spider-Man (2001) before. And it's quite a welcoming for having this opportunity the second time around. His version of the Spidey reboot is embedded with sharp characterization, spoonful of backstory, and fresh performance from young and aged actors.As a teenager, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is a science student in high school where he's bullied by Flash (Chris Zylka), and later on befriends with the beautiful Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). It's obvious that the squeeze of Peter is going to be Gwen, considering that it was Mary Jane to be first on the film's predecessor.Peter lives a struggled life after his parents Richard (Campbell Scott) and Mary (Embeth Davidtz) left. Now in the hands of his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field), his ambiguity about his parents' disappearance remains unanswered. But soon, Peter is eager to investigate further about his parents' absence, and later finds out that his father is a colleague of Dr. Curt Connors. Moreover, he discovers a scientific formula that Connors and his father have worked on.On the other hand, Dr. Connors (Rhys Ifans) of the OsCorp lab is working on a serum to regenerate limbs, particularly his right arm. Peter finds out that he's still working on the formula for his sake, and Connors gives Peter an opportunity to work together to develop the cure. But it turns out to be a tragedy when Peter realizes that he's collided with Connors' dire obsession and leads him to his great responsibility.Dr. Connors is in actual fact The Lizard, the new villain of the film. It's quite easy to guess how he becomes Spider-Man's enemy. It's a clash of prey and predator sort of exploit. I like the fact that in reality, the spider and the lizard make good enemies on the wall or roof. It's whimsical at that point, but the CGI is bloated with it and it deceives the eye. I can't blame the film for not using too much special effects. Unlike Christopher Nolan's hatred for using VFX in his Batman films, I wish they were stimulated to make the reboot no simpler like what he did to impress me.However, I like how the narrative where structured carefully to provide many details of Peter's background. It's very patient, but less stirring nevertheless, giving a painful 134 runtime. I hope they made some good exposition in the first act. In the second act, it gives a slow-burn feel, making you laugh more than thrilled. The script wasn't that bad. With three scribes James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves (Harry Potter screenwriter), they combine an elaborative story and hilarious quips to maintain the film alive and welcoming. But the problem is, I have seen this before. There are more obvious points than original.The casting is quite a surprising treat, with Andrew Garfield on board, which made a good performance in The Social Network. I admired Emma Stone more than I like her, maybe Amanda Seyfried could've been a good Gwen Stacy, but I accepted her. Martin Sheen maintains a strong character of Uncle Ben, probably better than Cliff Robertson. The same goes to Sally Fields as Aunt May as well. Lastly, the role of Denis Leary as Captain Stacy is a serious persona for Peter in maintaining a balanced relationship in character.As a whole, for passing what superhero films should have, The Amazing Spider-Man is actually fine. With a well-picked cast and a stunning remake, the film is worth the shot if you're up for a new Spidey universe. But then again, the hype is becoming like Sam Raimi's.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
back-story destroyed,"some great acting and Garfield nails the Ditko posing of the original comics, don't have a problem with him being too skinny either. Scenes in the sewers nicely echoed the original comic version of this movie, the Lizard is a formidable foe. HOWEVER the back story sucks. Now Flash becomes a misguided good guy, Gwen Stacy is a science nerd, there is no JJ Jameson instead we have the insipid police character. Parker can't wait to show off who he is to all and sundry, and plot rip offs from the Rami movie abound. And for crying out loud Stan Lee can't get enough of himself even now, someone shoot the guy please, with a gun. Most of the Spidey stuff was fine but all other factors in Peter Parkers life were trashed. Surely this rewriting of the characters life/plot is a DC move. There are other reviews of this that I agree with but as to the massive plot holes thru out this film the biggest must be the end where the 'cure' is dispersed over the city and yet has no affect on SPIDERMAN, double duh. The Rami movie is far better and truer to the original comics, Garfield need to step away from this project before it taints his very promising career.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
He A Sassy Lil' B!tch!,"The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)-Having now watched this for a second time, I will admit that I may have previously been overly critical of this film and consequently the actor in the title role.It isn't the best Spider-Man film ever made, but it is certainly better than its successor (The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)) and its predecessor (Spider-Man 3 (2007)).It would also be correct for me to say that Andrew Garfield really isn't bad in the lead role. He's just a bit more like the character in the comics, with his witty one liners, put downs and his slightly cockier demeanour.The cast in general though, aren't my favourite bunch of actors. They're all ok in their own right, mostly when mixed with other more enjoyable performers, but as a unit, no one in this cast really floats my boat.In fairness, while Sally Field was superb as Mrs Gump in 'Forrest Gump' (1994), even she has admitted that her Aunt May had no room for any dimensions.And Emma Stone has played some great characters in other films too, but she doesn't really impress me here at all as Gwen Stacy.The only one I can say that truly showed any real skill was Mr Garfield. I will always be, in my heart, a Tobey Maguire fan (Although Tom is awesome too), so when he was replaced it annoyed me and it may have skewed my ideas about this one before I even watched it. Viewing it for a second time and reading the IMDB Trivia section though, I can see that Andy really gave his performance all that he could and did what he was directed to do. His character/s is/are a change from what we had seen before, but there may be hundreds of comic book fans claiming that he is the better Spidey, because he has the attitude and the back chat as the man does in the books that he's famous from. I don't know them well enough to comment myself, but I feel that I have been unduly fair to Andrew and I apologise. He is much better than I remembered and his butt looks great in that Lycra.So, it's grown on me. It's a much darker storyline, with very little humour at all and it is filmed with a much darker look and filter too.The problem is that kids are so shady and jaded nowadays that you can't make the more fun films that would be a direct interpretation of the source material, because they'd call it babyish, so you end up with something that might actually scare a 12 year old in order to give them the thrill they seek. The films and comics have all now adapted to that and that's where the darker side comes from.This film actually shares some quite similar story elements to 'Spider-Man' (2002) and 'Spider-Man 2' (2004), if you consider the origin elements and the Doc Ock relationship that mirrors the one shown here with Dr Curt Connors. Even the romance is very akin to Peter and MJ in those films, but they have managed to make it new, by introducing different characters (And obviously actors) and updating some of the special effects.So yes, this one is better than I remember and I would place it higher than SM3.Honestly, I probably just fancied Andy more this time? I seem to be constantly on heat at the moment and maybe that wasn't the case last time I watched it?One thing that is for certain though, is if Stan Lee was a religion, I would worship at that church. Even the films that don't wow me, have the great characters and ideas that he and Steve Ditko originated and I do love that Spider-Guy! What's not to like? I'll tell you when I review the next one!681.81/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
To each his own,"I'm sure there are much more knowledgeable people out there in terms of Spider-Man expertise, after all I just read some of the 90's Spider-man comics when I was younger, not exactly a ""hardcore"" fan by all means, still I have to agree with a lot of the criticism directed towards this reboot attempt. Reboots or remakes aren't exactly a bad thing, but as time passes by we can verify that most of them, unfortunately, follow the global culture in which they were created. TASM is not an exception.For those who have seen Raimi's trilogy it will be impossible to ignore the déjà vu that you'll be left with. Almost all of the scenes will remind you that it all has been done already, no surprise there, after all the ""basic"" source material for both adaptations was the same, i.e. the comics (although with different scripts). Expecting morality out of a movie would be ridiculous, specially these days, but if you're older than the expected target audience for these movies you'll notice and be annoyed that they made the main character to constantly lie in order to avoid problems when he wanted to follow his own will. Realistic? Unfortunately yes. Faithful to the character portrayed in the comics? As far as I remember, no... Considering the fact that most times the majority of the audience is/will be composed by very young people, and specially if you're a parent, this won't be something you'll want to expose your children to. This isn't new, Raimi's Peter Parker also had some moral issues to deal with but in a way that was consistent with the comics.Then there are some inconsistencies within the characters themselves. Gwen Stacy is portrayed as being a bit snob and shallow (like MJ in the beginning). Despite her apparent concern with Peter in the beginning she never shows any romantic interest in him until he makes a little demo of his powers, something that kind of contradicts what she says in the sequel and at the same time what Emma Stone said in an interview about the character. Captain Stacy is portrayed as being the opposite of what he was in the comics as well (until he finds out who Spidey is). Overall TASM was an average movie with some good acting bits by the main cast, needing better and longer fight scenes and could have benefited with a better villain design.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A new director and an interesting vision for the franchise, with a cast unquestionable, and with well done and exciting action scenes, it's opened a space for future sequels","It is undeniable that Spider-Man is one of the most popular and beloved Marvel world. Since its emergence in the early 60s, its creators, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, with the idealized characteristics make more humanized among other comics characters of the same era. With the various impasses, Columbia Pictures chose to dispense with Sam Raimi and decided to reboot the franchise from the beginning, showing Peter Parker in high school, being bitten and learning to be Spider-Man. The studio called Marc Webb and the screenplay was written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves, based on a story by James Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt had the thriller Zodiac (2007) directed by David Fincher as their most outstanding work so far, Sargent has had experience in the Spider-Man franchise was scripted as the second and third films of the hero, and Kloves was responsible for almost all adaptations of the Harry Potter books to theaters. In this new script would be the villain Dr. Kurt Connors / Lizard, who was present in the three previous films, played by Dylan Baker, but always as an extra. Marc Webb also wanted to give greater prominence to the story involving the parents of Peter Parker. Finally, it would be the first film involving the hero also released in 3D format.Andrew Garfield - who had been prominent in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009) Terry Gilliam and The Social Network (2010) David Fincher - was chosen as the new Peter Parker / Spider-Man after being released that several actors were quoted to interpret the character. Josh Hutcherson, Jamie Bell, Michael Angarano, Alden Ehrenreich, Aaron Johnson, Logan Lerman and Anton Yelchin were some of these names. Here it is for the role of Gwen Stacy were listed Mia Wasikowska, Teresa Palmer, Diana Agron, Emma Roberts, Imogen Poots, Lindsay Lohan, Lily Collins, Ophelia Lovibond, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Georgina Haig and Dominique McElligott Hilary Duff, but in the end was Emma Stone, one of the highlights in recent years in Hollywood in films like Zombieland (2009), Easy A (2010) and Crazy, Stupid, Love. (2011), which was chosen to live The First girlfriend of Peter Parker. Here it is to live the villainous Lizard, Rhys Ifans British overcame the likes of Michael Fassbender and Christoph Waltz, winning the role. With a generous budget of about $ 220 million, filming finally began in December 2010 in various locations in the state of California, as Immanuel Presbyterian Church, St. John Bosco High School, and Taft High School in Los Angeles, and Also in New York.Marc Webb made some changes in his version, trying to make Peter Parker more realistic, we can say that this film uses assumptions similar to what Christopher Nolan did his hundred Batman Begins. The saga of a teenage Peter Parker more (even if you compare with Tobey Maguire who completed 37 years at the time of release of this film) is much more conducive to further exploration humorous superhero school and uncles home. Beyond the humor, you can also highlight the mood changes relevant to age, rage and conflicts arising from their newfound identity.The producers clearly more humanized the character, and the proof is that Peter Parker has more prominence than Spider-Man. Webb wanted to drive something more grounded in reality and it affecting the emotion of the scenes, the physical action and the clothes. Hence we have a deepening relationships of the characters, further exploration of the past of Peter with his parents, and a more paupável that it develops its technological apparatus, behaves, and is inspired to produce their clothing hero. The paths traced are less based on Steve Ditko world and probably closer visually and more influenced by the Ultimate universe, but also quite a world of our own creation. The director also made other changes in this new version, like the fact that Peter skating and taking the traditional glasses Peter Parker in many scenes, giving contact lenses to the boy. In fact, since the character was created by Stan Lee, moved very concept of the ""nerd"" in recent decades, and these changes are incorporated in the current reality and understandable. The most important story was kept as Peter being a kid excluded and lonely by choice, being hard to get close to him because it has been abandoned and did not want that to happen again.Another change is a greater emphasis on the genius of Peter. In this film we see their direct participation in the creation of the formula that gives the appearance of villain - what planet infect an entire city making them become reptiles - in addition to equipment scattered his room as the lock on the door, and especially in creating the web-slinger as soon as he decides to fight crime with the alter-ego Spider-Man - though here he uses material from Oscorp to enable your weapon / means of locomotion. Many fans criticized the release of Sam Raimi in which the webs leave directly from their hands as a result of genetic change occurred by the bite of the spider, as here, the webs are created by a device invented by Peter, following the history of comics and highlighting the genius of the young. Another most striking feature is the sense of humor of Spider-Man, which as in the comics, every time he encountered his enemies and villains possessed a mood much more acidic and fun. Bringing to the present day, it is as if Peter was the anonymity of the internet into that uniform and could be more sarcastic.Known peo photography work on director Michael Bay movies like The Rock (1995), Armageddon (1998) and Pearl Harbor (2001) and other blockbusters like Night at the Museum 2 (2009) and The Green Hornet (2011) John Schwartzman probably realize your best work to portray the most realistic and dramatic side desired by Marc Webb. Schwartzman was facing the challenge to film entirely in 3D without any conversion, putting the viewer in the place of Spiderman in action scenes. All outdoor scenes and capture the most dangerous side of New York, a darker side and dark city.Even the indoor scenes, whether in home environments uncles Peter at school Midtown, in the sewers of New York or within the laboratories of Oscorp, the climate darker and bluish scenes amplify the threat of the villain or villains of the city. It is important to say that not all the footage actually occurred in New York, as some outdoor scenes and studio also occurred in Los Angeles.
The production designer of the late J. Michael Riva - also responsible for the first two films in the franchise Iron Man - does a great job of riding the school where Peter studied by giving the modern technological environment in Oscorp laboratories by dangerous sets of sewage, and creativity in building every room in the house of his uncles Ben and May, especially in Peter's room, where we see several of his idols, tastes and passions, from his love of science and inventions (which lead to the creation of the trigger webs, but not fluid in web itself, the work of his father), his passion for photography and even your taste in movies and series, with ""Rear Window"" and ""Community"" gaining places on their wall.More than essential in action movies, the soundtrack is composed by this time 2 time Oscar winner James Horner. Responsible for soundtracks to films like Titanic (1997), A Beautiful Mind (2001), House of Sand and Fog (2003), The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (2008) and Avatar (2009), Horner easily transforms the work into something grand and exciting, even bringing strong remnants of his compositions for ""Titanic"", helps create moments of excitement and tension. Even being a soundtrack of personality and very versatile, is lower than the track from Danny Elfman in the first two films of Sam Raimi.Marc Webb confirms the intention of leaving everything including the real consequences of the actions of Peter. Peter actually shows quite bruised after fights, and his movement resembles the practice of ""le parkour"", with action poses referring directly to the stage character designed by Todd McFarlane. Adding to the mood during the fighting, the Spider is nicer than shown in the versions of Sam Raimi. The action scenes are also very well directed and realistic as the scene of the discovery of the powers in the subway, darkest death of Uncle Ben, the development of powers skate tricks, all the fights with Spider Lizard in the sewer, in high school and Oscorp tower. The presentation of the interior of the laboratories of Oscorp and Gwen's house, as well as the dialogues are very positive overall. The famous scene from the film Sam Raimi's kiss with Peter and Mary Jane upside-reversed, is replaced by the scene in which Peter grabs Gwen to the web and pulls on the balcony of his apartment building.The Amazing Spider-Man had the challenge of proving its existence being launched just 10 years ago the original film and 5 years of the end of the first trilogy, and managed to justify their existence. With a new director and an interesting vision for the franchise, with a cast unquestionable, with a technical finesse evident and well done and exciting action scenes, the franchise is renewed and open space for future sequels. A top notch entertainment and more faithful to the comics than with a longer expected expansion of this universe and this without the weight until the release of this new version, the expectation is even better future films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Lack of depth,"Having watched the previous spider-man editions featuring Toby McGuire, I had a huge expectation for the next remake. I was quite disappointed in what was offered in this version. The main thing lacking from this edition was the time spent on the characters - and this in both of the new movies. It felt like too many things had to happen it too short of a time, resulting in the lack of getting the audience to relate to the characters. As for the older version, the characters were plotted out very nicely and allowed the me to relate to every circumstance and situation the characters found themselves in. I personally think that one villain per movie is more than enough and that will mean more time spent on the villain to make the audience grasp the gravity of each situation. The new edition felt like a rush through characters, whether good or bad, and a rush through happenings. I enjoyed the movie, however these points mentioned above makes me long for the previous edition where we were forced to fall in love with each persona. I think that some elements in the new version are quite nice and fresh but I think a little more time before the release of this version would not have hurt anyone. All in all, enjoyable movie but the effect not as lasting as the previous edition. Watching these movies once is more than enough.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than its reputation,"With three different live-action interpretations in a 15-year span, Spider-Man's cinematic history is deeply complicated. Unlike other franchises which produce reboots to correct past mistakes, Spider-Man has been able to build upon and find depth with each new iteration the web-slinger. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy helped spark the superhero renaissance, Jon Watts' MCU films brought a levity to the character, and Marc Webb's variations brought darkness and grit to the character previously unseen.I absolutely love this film and that is largely due to the cinematography and direction. The POV shots are breathtaking, the bridge scene is mesmerizing and everything involving Uncle Ben and Aunt May is beautifully well-crafted. On multiple occasions, I was either brought to tears or covered in goosebumps due to the captivating performances and emotionally driven storylines. While there is brilliance in every Spider-Man film so far, this one might just be at the top.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Unnessacery, but not bad.","I loved Sam Raimi's first trilogy and was very Skeptical about this film, and thought it wasn't going to be good. Well it was okay, not as good as the first three films, but better than all the other stuff Marvel has been spewing out.It starts out as a generic high school movie, an outcast gets bullied and has a crush on a girl, blah blah. At first the movie was pretty boring but it picked up about 40 minutes in, to the point where I didn't notice the time going by. The origins of Spider-man are told again, only in a different way. This film felt like it had more emotion in it than the first Spider-man. Martin Sheen was good as uncle Ben, Curt Conners was nothing new. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone did a better job than Tobey and Kirsten in the previous entries. I still prefer Tobey Maguire as Spider-man thoughOver all this film was good popcorn entertainment, but nothing too special.

Pretty darn good.,"I grew up with Tobey Maguire playing the masked web-slinger, but re-watching it made me reconsider its greatness, because the acting was only sercivable and the romance lacking. But still Spider-Man 2 is a winner!But that brings me to The Amazing Spider-Man in which I actually was way more into Andrew Garfield's acting as Peter Parker, even if his take on the web-slinger was a tad overacted.And the romance with Gwen Stacey was actually really cute. So, the problems are minimal and I enjoyed the movie with the Lizard being an awesome villain and the action scenes with their intensity.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My favorite spider man,This Spider-Man holds a special place in my heart because he's most like the comics he did an incredible action job being the nerdy funny athletic Spider-Man we love most people who don't like this Spider-Man probably never read the comics so if he doesn't make a return in the mcu Spider-Man 3 we'll then he's making a mistake because he's damn well the best live action Spider-Man and will most likely always will be I'm sad they ended his movies because he was great.

"Acting is great, storyline is okay, film is too often hokey.","As we discussed in Episode 23, Part 1, of the podcast (www.livemancave.com), we love the Spiderman character, and Garfield not only does him justice, but he also presents a unique and charismatic version of Peter Parker that is even more interesting than when he dons the mask. Emma Stone brings The Girlfriend Experience, making Gwen Stacy endearing in her own right, not just because of how much the hero cares for her. Martin Sheen and Sally Field not only make you care about Uncle Ben and Aunt May, but they show you aspects of Spiderman that Garfield can't by himself. Denis Leary really manages to walk that fine line between pompous jerk and loyal protector right into the viewer's heart. In short, the acting is phenomenal.Unfortunately, the storyline is nothing special, and the movie is too often unnecessarily hokey (Really? Is it that easy to break into a high-security lab with genetically unstable spiders?), which conflicts with the film's more gritty tone. This film feels more like a background setup for sequel, which I have yet to see, but which I'm hoping will take the franchise to the next level, like Captain America: The Winter Soldier did for its franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Too many new characters and too much messing with classic story lines,"When I saw the appearance of Gwen Stacy early in this film i thought 'ah, this is the classic story where she gets killed by the Green Goblin and Spider-man avenges her death by killing the Green Goblin. I should have remembered unfortunately how much Marvel likes to distort and change their story lines when making film to comic conversions. Gwen Stacy was relegated to secondary importance and instead of trying to tell a classic story they completely confused the storyline by adding not one but two new villains. The way the symbiont creature was introduced was completely different (but then again I guess trying to retell the Secret Wars would have been too complex and expensive). As it was they reduced Venom's appearance who is one of Spidey's major foes to a subplot. The introduction of Kane Marko as Sandman was OK but once again which villain were we meant to be focussing on. When are Marvel going to realise that the original story lines have stood the test of time and don't need to contorted and amalgamated to create some kind of abridged version of the Marvel universe.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Amazing Spider-Man swings its way into a corpulent yet semi-realistic reboot.,"Unpopular opinion, but that's the beauty of art in all its forms, Raimi's original Spider-Man trilogy are not top-tier comic book adaptations in my view. The acting, story-lines, character dynamics, visual effects and disregard of general physics are not to my personal taste when experiencing blockbusters. Essentially, they were clean exercises in exploiting popular fiction with no cinematic edge. Then comes Webb's (coincidental surname!) reboot a few years later, after the travesty that was 'Spider-Man 3', to give the eponymous superhero a fresh lick of red and blue paint. Whilst technically not a remake, it does follow a similar origin path for the web-swinging ""vigilante"".Parker is bitten by a genetically modified arachnid, granting him ""spidey senses"", to which he must save New York City from a deranged scientist who can transform into a reptilian beast. The Amazing Spider-Man is in its own universe, separate to the previous iterations. A consequence of this, is that Parker's genesis into Spider-Man is retold. Beat for beat. Offering a monotonous familiarity that plagues the initial half of this reboot. Parker's parents abandon him, Uncle Ben is murdered and Spider-Man is born through the ashes of anger. However, what Webb's interpretation contains that sets it apart from others is the grounded realism to the superhero shenanigans. For every sprinkle of webbing shot at Lizard's nightmarish CG face, is an equally gritty surplus of drama to balance the tone. Aunt May and Uncle Ben being the strict parental figures to stabilise Parker's angst and spontaneity, creating a shield of relatability around himself.For the majority of the film, the focus is on Parker's own personal adversity against his inner turmoil. The action and spectacle commonly found within the genre is a product of Parker's conquered turbulence. The character physically becomes everything that Spider-Man, as an icon, symbolises through his own hardship. Something that Raimi's trilogy failed to portray convincingly. The added grit of realism assists in enhancing the moral conflict between vengeance and justice, with the infamous line (""with great power comes great responsibility"") from Uncle Ben, constructed ever so differently in this adaptation, highlighting that.The flip-side to the dramatic endeavour of the first half, is the subdued and almost forced blockbusting exhibition of the second half. The surrealistic plan that the Lizard hatched in the sewers of New York City juxtaposed the realism that polluted the streets and alleyways. Therefore, during the last thirty minutes, the lack of engagement is noticeable. The overtly clean visual style failed to regenerate any fresh limbs during the action sequences. All style, no substance. Except the POV shots of Spider-Man crawling up walls and swinging through downtown traffic. Exhilarating! Similarly the less visualised set pieces, such as Parker training in the shipyard, are accompanied by unusual song choices including Coldplay's ""Til Kingdom Come"". Sure it harks to the coming-of-age aesthetic that Webb directed, but starkly contrasts against Horner's spectacular musical score.The quintessential element that makes this reboot work so well, is the natural chemistry between Garfield and Stone. It is palpable. It is steamy. And it makes me sweat. Their onscreen romance was the perfect web of personality needed to elevate all eight legs off the ground. Garfield as the titular role was, and still is to this day, my favourite iteration. Quick-witted, sharp tongued and emotionally vulnerable. The Lizard had questionable motives to say the least, with a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde persona. Good intentions, yet not fully developed as the primary antagonist. Ifans however did give a credible performance as a deluded scientist.Several characters were underused and/or utilised primarily for foreshadowing. Gwen's father, Oscorp executive Ratha and school bully Flash to name a few. Various plot conveniences were littered throughout, most notably the saving a child in a burning car leading to an array of cranes positioning themselves to assist an injured Spider-Man into efficiently swinging his way to Oscorp tower. Some additional polish was required to smooth these glaring kinks out.However, I will state that The Amazing Spider-Man was a much required reboot. It upheld the essence of the titular superhero with a grounded approach that made him far more relatable as a character. Too many sub-plots and underdeveloped characters were thrown into the chemical mix, yet Webb's direction just about salvages itself from mediocrity. And, thankfully, no emo Parker dancing. Phew!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""Oh, I'm in trouble""","It wasn't very clear to me why would anyone make new Spider-man trilogy just five years after the previous one ended (quite poorly), but as I decided to see all Marvel flicks... I read IMDb reviews and cross myself. Tastes differ, that's a fact, but to rate this movie from one to three out of ten is nothing but spite. There is no way that anyone seriously thinks that this film is unwatchable crap, except of course if they look on the whole superhero genre that way, in which case it would be fairer not to evaluate it at all.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a reboot of the Spider-man franchise with a slightly different approach than Raimi's. The story is basically the same, but a bunch of details is changed. In some respects, this version is more faithful to the comic book, and in every respect I liked it better. The most obvious and critical difference is the characterization of Peter Parker, who, unlike the pathetic weenie from Raimi's version, is now a rebellious teenager with whom it is easier to identify. Also, Garfield is much more likable than Maguire, though he does not exactly fit the role of a nerd. The film has a great pace and balance of drama, action, and humor just to my liking. A little laughter, a little sitting on the edge of a chair, and two hours flew by. The only advantage of Raimi's version, very subjective though, is that, to me, Kirsten Dunst is much more attractive than Emma Stone, and the chemistry between her and Tobey is stronger than between Emma and Garfield.8,5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Wonderful Things are Coming.....Wonderful Things,"Five years after the successful, but bad Spider-Man 3 was released, the studio felt a reboot was in order. Frankly you cannot blame the studio for that, as Spider-Man 3 was indeed a bad to average film. However the franchise was just ten years old when this reboot hit the theaters in 2012. Which presents a lot of problems for this film.The story for the film, written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves is barely better than average. The film holds onto this need of a long and drawn out back story for Peter Parker. However the back story we were told in the Sam Raimi Spider-Man films, about ten years ago at the release of this film, told us that story, and quite well. Doing that leads to a water down film overall. While the development of the characters was very good, taking an hour or so of a film that is barely over two hours to tell the entire story over again is just bad thinking. The villain in the film, Dr. Curt Connors also known as The Lizard is actually very fun, however giving him a deep back story would have made him much better. I also enjoyed how they didn't go right for the major villains right out of the gate. Sure they give hints here and there at other major villains, but that is all.Directed by Marc Webb, he leads a wonderfully shot film. There are a few very fun flying scenes, shot in first and third person involving Spider-Man. These scenes look beautiful using CG. I also give him credit for using conventional filming as well. He doesn't overdo the CG like some superhero films do these days. The acting overall is amazing. From top to bottom this film delivers on its acting. Although I did feel at times Peter Park, played by Andrew Garfield, slipped out of his role. Although it doesn't really hurt the film. The battle scenes with Spider-Man and The Lizard are amazing as well. While the first battle is more over the top with the action, the final battle while still fun it did fall too short and rushed even.Composing the score for this film was James Horner. Superhero films usually have this heavy handed loud coming at you score. The score for this film was very light for most of the film. At times the score is amazing, for example near the end of the film, but for the rest of the film it just falls flat.Overall for the start of a new series, this film was just barely over average. In my opinion telling the entire back story in depth, and taking up a large portion of the run time was just a big mistake. I am still holding out hope for the sequel, which will be released just two days after this review is posted, but as for this film I will leave it at a barely about average. If you haven't seen the film already and you enjoy superhero films, then giving this a watch wouldn't be a bad idea. Or if you want to get caught up in time for the sequel.5.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What is amazing about this Spiderman,"I saw this movie in last weekend and was really frustrated. There was nothing in the movie that amazes you. Till the first half, the movie is quite slow. Second half is comparatively good but not that good that you spend money on this movie.Acting was OK. Some actions sequences were good. The music and effect were also good. But the poor copy of story from the original Spiderman makes this movie down. Andrew was not that effective as Spiderman. In the movie, they created a funny Spiderman rather than responsible. Rest of the case were okay in their role.Also, I recently heard from the news that they are planning to have sequel of this movie.

Solid Reboot of Familiar Source Material,"This is a movie is one that I missed in the theater originally. It was a time where I wasn't going often. Oddly enough, Spider-Man is one of my favorite comic book characters. I was intrigued to see what they were doing to do with this reboot or re-imagining of the source material. This is one that I saw on DVD soon after coming out and finally gave it a rewatch with Jaime as she never saw it.For this one, Andrew Garfield is taking on the role of Peter Parker. Something this one different from the Toby Maguire ones is that we see Peter's parents and the night they disappeared. They are Richard (Campbell Scott) and Mary Parker (Embeth Davidtz). The two are presumed dead so young Peter goes to live with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field).In the present day, Peter goes to high school where he is bullied by Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka). He has a crush on Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). He discovers a brief case at home that belonged to his father and this leads him to meet Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans). He worked with Richard on blending animal DNA with humans to make people better. Dr. Connors is also trying to regrow his arm with the use of lizard DNA. Peter brings a formula he found in his father's papers to the doctor and this leads them to making it work in mice DNA. Dr. Connors believes he's going to lose this project when he refuses to help Norman Osborn, so he tests it on himself. This changes him into The Lizard.Peter and Gwen hit it off to which leads him to have dinner at her place, meeting her father of Captain Stacy (Denis Leary). He's a police officer in charge of the investigation into Spider-Man and his vigilante efforts. This complicates him trying to stop The Lizard before it is too late.Now I'll be honest, I don't get the hate for this one. Jaime preferred this one to the Maguire trilogy. We get another intro to the Uncle Ben passing away and Spider-Man going on his crusade to make up there. I'm glad that we got a different villain with The Lizard. We also don't have Mary Jane here and instead get Gwen who is another love interest for Peter. This one does a different take where there are multiple people who know Spider-Man's identity as opposed to how much he tries to hide it.I also think this is a well-made movie. I don't have issues with the filmmaking. This goes CGI heavy as most do when you get this comic book superhero movies. I like the suit that Spider-Man starts with and when he finally gets to his classic one. The take on The Lizard is interesting and it works well enough. Jaime pointed out that the soundtrack is quite epic feeling. She went as far to say it reminded her of Titanic. It was funny and she's also not wrong.The only other thing to go into would be the acting. I don't mind Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He adds a bit more sarcasm which the character uses in the comics. I thought that was funny. Stone is great as Gwen. I'm just a fan of her. I liked having the likes of Ifans, Leary, Sheen and Field. We also get cameos from Irrfan Khan, Davidtz and even C. Thomas Howell. This has a solid cast across the board which surprises me that it didn't do better.In conclusion, give this a viewing. I don't think it is as bad as people say. It isn't the best movie out there, but enjoyable regardless. If you're not a Spider-Man purist, just turn your brain off and go with the movie.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I love this movie, even with all the mistakes","I love any Spider-Man movie that focuses on Peter Parker, and The Amazing Spider-Man does that really well. This film highlights Peter's teenage side with scenes that reflect his personality, like when he shows off during a basketball game. One thing that sets Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man apart is the heavier focus on romance, which works perfectly with both him and Emma Stone. Their chemistry is incredible, and the relationship between Peter and Gwen is one of the film's strongest aspects, although it starts a bit rushed. Even though Peter already had a crush on Gwen, revealing he's Spider-Man so quickly, without really knowing her, feels too sudden.The Spider-Man suit in this movie is amazing, easily one of the best versions to date. Another standout is Flash. Despite being the stereotypical bully, he shows surprising empathy when Uncle Ben dies. The actor did a fantastic job, changing his voice and body language to reflect that shift. Peter's humor is also spot-on, natural and well-timed, without feeling forced.However, the film has its flaws. Uncle Ben's death was poorly handled. The idea of him confronting an armed robber just to protect some money feels unrealistic and unnecessarily dramatic. The fights with the Lizard, while decent, lacked emotional weight, and Captain Stacy's death, though impactful, felt somewhat contrived in the larger story.Overall, I love this movie. It has many strengths, but its flaws hold it back from being perfect. Even so, it's a great take on Spider-Man, offering a charismatic, human, and layered Peter Parker.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Too soon?,"It doesn't seem long ago that Tobey Maguire created history as Spiderman and here we are witnessing it happen all over again as Andrew Garfield tries to defend New York against Dr. Curt Connors, also referred to in some circles as 'The Lizard'.The story is familiar. At a very young age Peter Parker's parents leave him with his uncle Ben and his aunt May for his own benefit. Years later he starts to uncover the reason for their mysterious disappearance when he finds an old briefcase that belonged to his father. A little research brings Peter to Oscorp, face to face with his father's old partner Dr. Curt Connors who, given his handicap, has spent his life trying to perfect cross-species mutation. Of course in the process an eight legged friend manages to give our snooping protagonist a little peck and his life changes forever.Marc Webb, (appropriately named for this venture) manages to provide the audience with an enjoyable experience overall, despite a few flimsy sequences but it is Andrew Garfield who stands out as the movie rests completely on his shoulders. Inevitably there will be comparisons but he holds his own, giving Spiderman that 17 year old boyish charm and bewilderment. Emma Stone fits in perfectly as Gwen Stacy but doesn't really have much to do. Overall, the film doesn't have the impact that it intends to deliver and comparisons with Sam Raimi's version may not go in its favor but for Spiderman fans it is definitely worth a watch as it gives us the opportunity to see our friendly neighborhood Spiderman battle a new nemesis, this time in the form of 'The Lizard'.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing Spiderman was really Amazing,"The Amazing Spider-man was really amazing. The 3D effect implemented in the film was providing an extra entertainment through out the movie. Our hero Mr. Peter Parker got a spider bite from a spider used for the chemical testing in a research organization Os corp. After that he realizing his amazing power to swing through the street with his spider web. Those scenes are perfectly made us so exciting with the cool 3D effects. Then the most lovable moments between Our heroine Gwen Stacy and Our Hero Peter Parker.The street stunt scenes are pictured in 3D effects and we get statue-d with our breath until spider-man lands on a safe position. The heroism shown by the Peter Parker after he got the spider power was super. The scenes that everything got destructed when he touches anything was really made us laughing.It is very sad to see a good scientist Dr Curtis Connors turns to be a gigantic lizard while he inject a particular solution to his body to regenerate his lost limps just like a lizard. The exciting moments in the movie was the fight between the terrific lizard and our spider-man. These all are pictured in 3D effects.When I search for The Amazing spider-man, I could able to see my Spider-man already released in certain Toy Stores. With an enthusiasm I browsed that website. Ahh.. It made me to remember those wonderful movie scenes once again in my mind. I loved those products.

It's amazing,"As the name itself. It's an amazing movie and really worth to watch. I love how it has a new look on it. A girlfriend can help, not only screaming, whining and waiting for a hero boyfriend to save. In this movie, Gwen helps him a lot. It also shows us that hero is not perfect and being amazing in very first time when they get their power, they still need to learn to be amazing.I also love how the character, personality of Peter improves time by time.The most special thing I love in this movie is evil character (the Dr.Connors) still have a good side of human in his personality. It shows people always have good and bad side in their own heart, as long as you know how to control it.This movie still has some fun parts to make watchers are relaxing, not too stressful.A movie always has many different reviews, love or not love it is depended on your thinking but for me, it's totally a great movie. I really enjoy my whole time of watching it and I will recommend my friends, family to watch it.Thank you,",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Is it really amazing?,"The biggest hurdle this film has to jump is that it can't seem like a cash grab to keep the studio owning the rights to the character before it reverts back to Marvel. So the question I ask myself and I ask those who've seen it. Did it feel like this movie needed to be made, or more importantly, does this story need to be told again only ten years after Sam Raimi's Spiderman? The answer, for me, is no.The problem is the film treads familiar ground for too long, we've seen this story before. What does this film offer that differs from the original series? Well, the main thing is that his parents are more present and that gives a mysterious element to the film. Clearly all a ploy to set up a new trilogy. There are a lot of things introduced into this film that scream sequel. It's a thin ice, on one hand it will ultimately serve the viewer better down the road...if they care to continue the journey. At the end of the day, the feeling that I got with this film was this: an excuse to keep the franchise at Sony.One of the biggest missteps this film has is the relationship between Gwen Stacey and Peter Parker. The fault lies within the script and the chemistry between the two. On their own, they are both great, together, it's a mess. I never bought the relationship from the set-up, to the conclusion. It felt forced and when they were together, I was asking myself why do they seem so awkward on screen? So the casting works on varying levels. Leary is given little to do, but this isn't his story anyway, then we have Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors a role that was played by Dylan Baker in every Raimi Spiderman film. Had Baker been the villain in the 3rd Spiderman, maybe we'd be enjoying their fourth collaboration and not this revamp. Ifans relationship to Peter in this film is lacking and his turn to the villain is underwhelming. There are scenes that feel ripped out of the original, specifically Connors battling his inner self exactly like Dafoe as the Green Goblin. It felt out of place as it only happened I think once, maybe twice. I never really found Spiderman to be in any danger during this film. We have a giant lizard creature attacking him and I never felt any suspense. This leads into another fault of the film.The action sequences are messy. Not once did I think ""Oh, that was cool/interesting/neat/new/inventive"" anything along those lines. Marc Web (yes, his last name is Web) was the wrong man for the job. He had a brilliant debut film 500 Days of Summer and I figure Sony was trying to go the Marvel route and try out more ""unconventional"" directors for the gig. Yet his inexperience shows a bit with the action sequences, all of them lack the thrills the original trilogy had.So where does this film succeed? As I said before, when they are not on screen together, both Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield are quite good. The scenes showcasing Spiderman swinging through the city are huge improvements over the original trilogy. They look real, feel real and he moves like the character would in the comics. I surprisingly liked the more realistic feel to this one. It works for and against it at times. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, there is a bit of mystery added to the overall story here. Peter's father, his story and his relation to future possible villains in something that I am actually looking forward to.Despite feeling underwhelmed with the entire production, it does feel a bit more polished than a thrown together superhero film. This is no Iron Man 2. But I would have much rather of seen another Raimi entry, a redeeming entry to the 3rd, than this one. This would probably be on par with the original Spiderman, but the question of whether or not this particular story, one which we are way too familiar with, should it have been told again? My answer is no.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Made me appreciate the previous version,"While this Spider-Man reboot is certainly more enjoyable than most movies, the previous version was better. The writers went out of their way to change all the little details from the previous version, but kept much of the same major plot points the same.This version's morality points, catch phrases, romance and emotional moments just weren't as well done. And there was almost no comedy. There were no major plot holes, but there were multiple small ones that bugged me. On the other hand, the acting was excellent, by all the actors, and the awkward teenager aspect was well done.But on the whole I prefer the previous version.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
We need more guys like Spiderman in our messed up world,"If you're looking for a different Spiderman to the corny Tobey Maguire ones then you're not going to find it here. The Amazing Spiderman is visually stunning though and the movie gets better the longer it goes. We all know the story behind this classic comic book hero, the nerdy kid who gets bitten by a radioactive spider and becomes formidably powerful and uses his newfound abilities to protect the citizens of the city from dangerous customers and this one has the Lizard Man running rampant and causing chaos.Without the very entertaining action sequences and special effects this would be a very dull experience, because the characters are uninteresting, the dialogue is cliche and quite a few things that I won't mention, don't make much sense. Far fetched is a term that springs to mind throughout and I'm not talking about Spidey's physical feats, rather the odd decisions made by characters. But I guess that's not much to complain about when the visual spectacle takes us away from worrying about such things.A decent watch for all ages, the Amazing Spiderman takes us on a thrilling ride transcending the 2+hours with enjoyable ease.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"By the standards of the previous Spider-Man movies, decent","This movie was mediocre. Obviously, because the previous Spider-Man movies were, well, a lot below expectations, it's easy to say that this new movie was better. But looking at in a more general view, it's no more than decent.Same old plot line: Peter Parker (who is considerably less geeky in this movie than in the other series; Peter is supposed to be a nerd, so this kind of puts you off) is bitten by the radioactive spider and starts shooting webs, then Uncle Ben dies, Peter cries, and vows to fight crime. I can't imagine how the directors could have made that any less cheesy than it already sounds, so I won't hold that over their heads.But one thing I have to call out is Curt Connors/The Lizard's goal. After combining his DNA with that of a lizard and transforming himself into a reptilian beast (with pretty good C.G.I., I'll give the film- makers that), he sets out to conduct ""the next stage of human evolution"" or something like that. So he abruptly decides he wants to convert every single human in New York into the same lizardly state he currently presides in?? Where did THAT come from??So the guy's a little sore about being a giant green scaly mess. But would that really cause him to decide that the rest of the world needs to become lizard-men too? This rather random goal seemed kind of out of the blue for me.Also, I would have really liked to see both Gwen Stacy AND Mary Jane Watson in this movie. At least 50% of the drama and complexity of Spidey's story comes from his fluctuating relationships with those two women, so not including both of them, in neither this film nor the previous series, was a disappointment. I would have really enjoyed seeing the directors take on the challenge of showing Spidey/Peter's relationship(s) with these women, because it adds much more reality to the story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Loved IT ....  refreshing movie,"The audience went crazy for Andrew as he looks so fit for the spider role. All shows were houseful and i m sue that it will make you smile and the 3D effects are AMAZING.. The action seq are shot brilliantly, however at times i was missing Tobey a must watch. background score is just marvelous. This new film unfolds Parker's world with more attitude. The feel-good mush of the last three films is gone, and the action is duly sexed up to suit 3D basics. It's a dynamic new way to see Spidey on screen, and as he gets better -- both at his job and at realizing just what his job is -- this new Spider-Man soars.

A drastic change from the Raimi trilogy - it's impossible not to make comparisons - but it's not necessarily bad.,"Andrew Garfield is an amazing actor and does his best with what he's given, however his Peter Parker is not soft. He's athletic enough to ride a skateboard, he stands up to bullies and he's charming enough to get the girl. Talking about Gwen, their romance is so well done that I feel it's on the same level as MJ and Peter's from the original trilogy.This movie's biggest flaw is its pacing in my opinion, it's slow and they could have cut a good 30 minutes. The first half is focused more on Peter's journey to becoming Spider-Man, while the second is set on stopping the Lizard.I don't have much to say about the villain, I like how they designed him and his backstory is pretty standard. He lacks the charm of other Spider-Man villains though. The fight scenes are pretty good and I really liked some details like Peter using a web to detect where the Lizard is.I'm not a fan of the suit, sorry. The dark eyes make him look creepy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Off to a much better start than the previous trilogy,"First of all, I was one of the people who did not think it was necessary to do a Spiderman movie reboot, but after seeing ""The Amazing Spiderman"" I am very glad they did. Andrew Garfield played a much better Peter Parker/Spiderman than Tobey Maguire ever did. He actually looks more like high-school student as well. I also enjoyed the Peter Parker/Gwen Stacy storyline more than the Peter Parker/Mary Jane Watson storyline. The villain of Dr Curt Connors/The Lizard was fantastic. All the characters seemed to be easier to relate to than in the previous movies. It gives you more of a realistic look at how a real high school student would react if given superhuman spidey powers. The roles of Uncle Ben and Aunt May didn't seem to be as major in ""The Amazing Spiderman"" than in the previous trilogy, but I liked that because it didn't take away from the film or drag on the scenes with them in it. On the whole, I prefer ""Spiderman 2"" to ""The Amazing Spiderman"" or maybe I just need to re-watch them both, but if ""The Amazing Spiderman"" is an example of where this trilogy is headed, I am very excited for it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mr. Webb is certainly not an untalented director; he just might have been the wrong guy for this project,"Considering that only a mere ten years have passed since Sam Raimi rebooted the popular Spider-Man franchise to the big screen, one does wonder why Hollywood has decided to start afresh once again rather than just continue what Mr. Raimi had begun. Part of the reason, I suppose, would be the anger and disappointment—which I shared—over Mr. Raimi's Spider-Man 3. The other reason might be the disappointment over the casting of Tobey Maguire as the titular, web-spraying superhero—disappointment which I did not share. But why start over? James Bond has gone through many incarnations without going back to the beginning again. Imagine how repetitive and frustrating it would have been to see him get his double-O status every time a new actor decided to play him. So I saw no real need for this Spider-Man reboot beforehand; my reluctance is enhanced in hindsight, as The Amazing Spider-Man is a valiant but mostly unimpressive effort.It would seem as though the trio of screenwriters (James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves) shared the general audiences' disappointment in Tobey Maguire playing Peter Parker/Spider-Man ten years ago, but were utterly in love with the first movie's story. Obviously, I am fully aware that both movies are based on the same comic book, but they do follow a rather similar narrative pattern. In fact, it's much too similar. Our hero starts off as a tormented dweeb, gets bitten by a genetically altered spider, starts suffering strange side-effects, watches his uncle die in the streets, goes on a vengeance mission, makes a costume, runs from the police, sees a previous father-figure turn into a vile green monster after injecting himself with some kind of solution, and so on. Both climaxes also conclude with a supporting character being stabbed clean through the torso and dying, and the hero making a moralistic call regarding his love interest.Every twist and turn in the plot seems all that familiar, because again, it has not been that long. History has shown that familiar stories can be effectively told when done with a certain level of style or discipline. The director of The Amazing Spider-Man is certainly a filmmaker with style and discipline. His last movie was (500) Days of Summer, which I regard as one of the very best of contemporary American love stories. In supervising an action-packed spectacle, however, Mr. Webb seems to lose his head. He is not yet much of an action specialist and a number of the fight sequences seem choppy. A squabble onboard a subway train, with every shot filmed much too short and each camera sweep far too blurry, lacks the sense of humor and surprise that was obviously intended. Even the CGI shots of Spider-Man whisking over the rooftops of New York have an unfinished feeling to them, as if key shots were missing. At one point, he throws himself off a high-rise, catches a wall with his web, is about halfway down the building, and in the next shot is just two feet from the pavement and already slowed down. It is in the quieter moments—a scene where our protagonist ponders over a genetics algorithm in his bedroom—that his montage and gift for camera angles falls into place. Mr. Webb is certainly not an untalented director; he just might have been the wrong guy for this project.The film also suffers from a schizophrenic screenplay: one that toggles between overwritten and underwritten. It is overwritten in its dialogue; would-be comical banters between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, as his love interest, go on much too long, repeat themselves too often, and do not deliver the touching bits of humor they were meant to. Underwritten are the plot points: the chemical developed by the villain as a means to regenerate amputations; Peter Parker's dynamic with his doomed uncle; the dynamic between Parker and his love interest's hard-as-nails father, who works on the police force. As played by Mr. Garfield, this new Peter Parker is rather irritating; this good actor's talents come to life in more subtle roles—the way this character should have been written. But his frantic dialogue delivery and quirky mannerisms seem phony, unlike the more plausible performance that Tobey Maguire gave ten years before. We don't learn much about the character; the most interesting thing I learned was that he was obviously a Hitchcock fan, as I spotted a poster of Rear Window on his bedroom wall. Yes, that was the most interesting thing that came to my mind after considering the film. Worse still is a completely uninteresting villain. Spider-Man's adversary this time around is the Lizard: a dinosaur-like brute with a permanent smile on his face. The computer graphics are decent enough; but the character is not given ample screen-time for us to really feel the impact of his motives. The Lizard has been written in a way as if the filmmakers really did not care who Spider-Man went up against, as if they only included him because the world expects a bad guy in every superhero story ever told.In fact, that's the feel of this picture entirely. I got the impression that the filmmakers really did not care whether or not The Amazing Spider-Man was a success or not. The audience apparently wanted a big, lavish reboot and they got one. But is this picture really necessary? I don't think so, as I could have easily spent half the money to rent Sam Raimi's first Spider-Man picture, which featured almost the exact same story, same surprises, same twists, and all done with more energy and excitement.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Batman Begins but worse,"Overall The Amazing Spider-Man is kind of how good I expected it to be. I kind of expected it to be a mostly-soulless-but-great-action type of movie. Instead it was a some-emotion-with-good-action type of movie. However it's also in almost every way trying to replicate Batman Begins, mostly failing to get the epicness.If you think about it The Amazing Spider-Man and Batman Begins have a very similar plot, and similar characters too. Also how the main characters handle their new power (even if it isn't fantasy or Sci-fi like) is very similar. However, to me, the Batman Begins has much better action scenes and a darker tone than this Spider-Man. Plus this Spider-Man movie almost feels older than the Batman Begins even though it isn't.However with all this talk about how Spider-Man is unoriginal, it still reaches its goal of being entertaining.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Amazing Spider-ManYou'd think someone with the abilities of a spider would also gain their fear of feet and rolled-up newspapers.However, the spider-like teenager in this action movie is unflappable around all splatter methods.After a genetically altered spider bites him, high school pariah Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) gains the attributes of an arachnid and becomes the costumed Spider-Man.Elsewhere, a key element to bonding human/animal genes discovered by Peter's dead dad (Campbell Scott) turns Dr. Connors (Rhys Ifans) into a rampaging lizard.When Connors plans to turn everyone in the city into an amphibian like him, Peter, his girlfriend (Emma Stone), and her father (Denis Leary) scramble to prevent it.Embodying Parker's awkwardness and Spidey's wiriness, Garfield is perfectly cast. The darker tone, origin reiteration and mundane villain, however, don't stick.Besides, if producing cobwebs is what it takes to be a super-hero than any grandmother's crotch could be one.

"They did it again..., and again, and again","An average film for the superhero genre, The Amazing Spider-Man follows the same story from the comics. Exactly as did the previous Spiderman movie, from only 10 years earlier. If anything, it amazes through its sheer mediocrity.The effects are OK, the actors don't seem to be asleep half the time as in the 2002 film, the story is, as I was saying, the same. I can't possibly spoil the plot if you've seen any other Spiderman movie, animation or if you've read the comics.So one has to wonder: why did they do it?

Not so amazing for me,"The Amazing Spider is not so amazing at all. Whatever people might have said, I still think Andew Garfield is neither fitting as Spiderman no Peter Parker.

Then again, I still have friends who said this is awesome Though I don't see from which perspective this is awesome but at least it proves that they still have audience who love it. Also it's rated quite highly in IMDb as well. So I think I just probably grew up on Spiderman.

Andrew Garfield doesn't make the cut for me.,"The movie is good, a worthy successor to the Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies, but Andrew Garfield is nowhere near as good as Tobey Maguire.

Emma Stone played her role perfectly, I was always amazed by her acting and she prooved me here once more of her capabilities. Other than that, I feel like the movie needed another antagonist, an anti-hero right next to ""The Lizard"", just like things were going on in the first 3 Spider-Man movies. I don't know, maybe is just nostalgia hitting me, but yes, I think that the movie overall is quality, but not as good as Sam Raimi's.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A spectacle of Character Studies: Although tampered by the studio, the characters are the takeaway and not the superhero plot.","I get it, Tom Holland is THE definitive Spider-Man, Tobey Maguire was the first and only Spider-Man... But Andrew Garfield was a HUGE Spider-Man fan before he got chosen for this incarnation. And if there's something Mark Webb, the director, understands and spends a lot of time into are characters.I am not going to point out the awful costume and creature designs, the plotholes and inconsistencies, the lack of loyalty to the original source material... None of the live-action Spider-Man interpretations have come close to representing properly EVERY SINGLE ASPECT of the Spider-Man persona.So given the unexperience of the director (check out his prior films to this one), the conditions in which he had to reboot Spider-Man having the Avengers 2012 and Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy broken and revolutionized the Superhero genre; and the pressure of Sony because their rights to the IP was about to expire... I say this movie was decently good.Now Amazing Spider-Man 2 basically destroyed everything the first one did. The first one, if you take away the IP characters and the horrible aesthetic choices, you'll find a movie about a teenager traumatized from loosing his parents and coping with the fact that he is almost a burnout or a socially excluded person. And sure, it isn't fair, because it is actually a Superhero movie, the important part should be the ""superhero"" part of the story not the characters.I was one of those people, that criticised this movie for desecrating the prior movie interpretation and the comic book character, for daring to be so ""modern"" or change so many things of the original. But when I heard the interviews and making-of of this movie, the energy, work and vision put into it by all the creative parts (not talking about the Sony executives that were there poking with a stick to make decisions that'd bring more money), from the director to the actors. I realized by their words that they gave them their all, that it was unfair to not value their contributions, their deliberate performances and genuine emotions because of bad ""production"" direction.IN CONCLUSION, give it a second chance, see beyond what bothers you, look at the bigger scope. You'll find an endearing story, with a lot of emotional resonance that speaks to the audience. And above all value the performances on their own, forget that this is Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy, uncle Ben... They were never going to accomplish the success of the first trilogy, and the overhyping of the MCU Spider-Man, imo, is still unearned in terms of the Spider-Man story. As part of a bigger universe, it served its part, but I still have to see how they handle the Spider-Man story. But like with every interpretation out of the comics (and even within the latest comics series) there hasn't been an interpretation that has been 100% loyal to the three main legs that conform Spider-Man: characters, stories and aesthetic/visuals. Although I should confess the most successful one has been ""Into the Spider-Verse"", check that one out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The Only Letdown Was The Avengers, The Rest Was Simply Amazing","After watching this film, I can't believe the amount of bashing that people are giving at this film since I think this film was great and is far better than Tobey Maguire's versionIts darker and grittier just the way I like it. Its sad because the only reason in my opinion that this film did not get much hype that it deserves was mainly because it released on the same year as The AvengersAndrew Garfield played the character verywell and made Peter Parker looked more believable and intelligent. Emma Stone fitted her role as Gwen Stacy perfectly and unless the girl who becomes Mary Jane in the next sequel is able to outshine Emma's performance, I'll be verysad that Peter had let her go. Rhys Ifans as the Lizard was convincingly good too but reasons for him to turn evil did not look strong enoughA minor complain that I would point out would have to be the action scenes.

The amazingly unnecessary Spider-Man reboot,"Throughout this entire movie I had a very distinctive feeling I had seen something familiar just a while ago. Oh waitI did. Only five years have passed since the last Sam Raimi Spider-Man movie premiered, and I simply do not understand why this Spidey reboot was made so soon. Nevertheless we get to watch Spider-Man climb walls, fight crooks, swing in nets between buildings in a supposed to be new and amazing motion picture. The problem is that none of this amazes me because it feels like I watched it only yesterday. I haven't had the time to get the hots or to build up any anticipation for a reincarnation of Marvel's spider. Neither have I accepted the fact that I never again will see Tobey Maguire in that red and blue spandex suit. Not enough time has gone by. Not even Peter Parker initially becoming Spider-Man and his conflicted feelings and inevitable problems due to this concerns me because, like I said, it feels like I watched this the other day. Sure, the story isn't all the same as previous screen adaptations of the comic book hero. We get the background story of Peter's parents, there's a new villain on the loose etcetera, but when you get down to it that's just a different setting to an already told story.I like the Sam Raimi trilogy. It has the right balance between comic book and real life and the world presented to you feels quite realistic. The movies aren't exactly literary works of art, but compared to Mark Webb's ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" they've got considerable depth. In ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" everything feels flat, like a copy, like a bad cover band that just makes you want to see the original act. Furthermore, a lot of the dialogue seems off-pace, Andrew Garfield's neurotic way of acting makes me uneasy and pretty often I'm not sure what emotions the actors (mostly Garfield and Stone) are supposed to convey. This of course leads to some confusion regarding the characters' feelings for each other as well as their intentions. If this is a case of bad directing or bad acting I'm not sure. The movie is also edited into a higher-than-necessary pace. Almost every cut could easily be two seconds longer and almost every scene could easily be two minutes longer. A high tempo doesn't per se make a movie more exciting, it could just as well have the reverse effect.So, was there nothing I liked about this movie? Sure there was. I liked how things where explained and made possible by the technical and scientific skills of Peter Parker's. Things like how he makes his suit, his net-throwing gadgets and so on. It ties in nicely with who he is as a person. I liked the witty punch lines when they weren't out of pace. I also liked Stan Lee's cameo, which was unusually elaborate.At the beginning of the film the background story of Peter Parker's parents takes up a lot of time. I first thought that this was an interesting approach to a new Spidey movie but soon realized that it was just an excuse to get Peter in touch with Oscorp and Curt Connors. The fate of his parents is actually irrelevant to the Peter Parker/Spider- Man character since what's really interesting about him is the conflict within himself and the seemingly impossible choices he so often has to make. The Tobey Maguire movies don't mention a single word about Peter's parents and still manage to get you so much more involved with the characters than this movie does. The filmmakers do however make hints that they intend to develop this whole parent thing further in possible sequel/sequels, so I might be proved wrong about the relevance in the end.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Competent But Unnecessary Take On The Character.,"The Amazing Spiderman movies were the result of Sony trying to keep themselves wholly independent of MARVEL Studio's influence or rights-holding; and the film really shows it years on from its release. This is like if a Chris-Nolan-wannabe did Spidey knowing all the basic stuff on the character and decided to cut out all the occasional humour/campiness of the Raimi movies that made them stand out from somber action flicks. Not that I really have anything against Marc Webb as a director, but you'd think that his work on 500 Days of Summer would have better reflected the teen-drama aesthetic present in the Spiderman stories. Sadly the vibrancy of Summer doesn't come up in this Spiderman movie. Though Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey is some of the best casting this side of 2010s Hollywood.All in all it's a Spiderman movie; just not a standout one.

"Very Disappointing, yet shines through here and there","The Amazing Spider Man? I would call it The ""Almost amazing but not quite there"" Spider Man. On one hand, you have excellent performances from Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) and Rhys Ifans, incredible action scenes coupled with some surprisingly gorgeous special effects and awesome choreogrpahy, and a funny script. On the other hand, you have a villain that could have been so much more intense and frightening, an unused pallet of comic book lore, a really ultra bad screenplay (for the first 2/3 of the film), and an overall feeling of ""this could've have been so much more grand, big, epic, and exciting"".And that's just it. One phrase that a director never wants to hear: that could've been much more exciting. While the finale is undeniably cool and cinematic, that's when the movie actually starts getting good. All of the rising action happens in the latter part of the film, in an explosive fight in a high school none the less, but you don't really feel any intense emotion for any of the characters or conflicts happening on screen, nor does the villain have any tangible conflict with Spider Man. (this might get cleared up in the sequel, but for a 136 minute flick this is lame). And can't you find a better way to kill off Martin Sheen?But enough bashing, The Amazing Spider man does plenty of things well. Special effects are spectacular and the stylization and colors screams ""comic book"". Andrew plays a sharp, like- able, and witty Peter Parker/Spider Man, Rhys Ifans plays an intense villain, Emma Stone is OK, and the rest of the character roster is either cliché or stupid, but mainly because of the bad screenplay. The design of The Lizard is incredibly cool and savage, and Spidey's new suit is neat.If there is a takeaway from TASM, the new series reboot is in shaky hands. This origins story has an apparent identity crisis, where most of it wants to be a funny romantic comedy with some cool action thrown in. This is obviously not a good direction for Spider Man, as the last Spider Man (Spider Man 3) movie fell apart due to the love interest becoming too much of a focus.Webb seriously needs to head back to the drawing board in terms of character development and story, villainy and tension. He has all of the source material, actors, lore, and style just sitting there, and it just needs the right direction. It's an origins story that never really fully takes off, so here's hoping that the sequel is truly amazing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
If i could give more then 10 i would.,"I may not be as sophisticated and and educated about the film industry as some other reviewers here that know who made what and when and why.But i do know a great movie when i see one, this is by far the best spider man movie i've seen, for one simple reason, i enjoyed it the most, and its been a while since i enjoyed a super hero movie.In my opinion it captures beautifully the fantastic world of spider man bringing you believable characters that are very well played without embarrassing to watch crys and silly over the top acting (see the other spider man movies) it gives you a realistic feeling that is very VERY rare in such movies, though still fantastic and awesome as a super hero movie should be.The main character is original, don't know about you but i'm tired seeing this movies being a nerds fantasy world, at last we see a super hero that was not a total dimwit before he got his powers, maybe this is one of the reasons it got so many bad reviews? nerd rage anyone?For me this is the best spider man movie, the action is great, engaging and well paced, the dramatic moments are emotional, all in all this is a complete package of quality stuff.It's hard to say if you will enjoy it, but if you just come to have fun and let spider man have a new beginning you will be in for a treat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Truly Magical,I Came Into The Theater On The 4th of July and i was so pumped my childhood was spider-man with Tobey Maguire but then i saw this was a magical film Andrew Garfield Did A Wonderful Job As Peter Parker But A Magical Job as Spider-Man He Was Perfect I Heard There Was Going To be a Trilogy So I Thought Lets See If He Can Pull it off For 2 More Films Then There's The Gorgeous Emma Stone Playing Gwen Stacy I Thought She Was So Adorable In This Film Her and Andrew Are So Cute Together and I'm a guy The Best Part Was The Acting and the effects are great The Lizard Just Pops Out At You and i saw this in 2D so amazing the one thing i hated was it felt like they skipped like 20 scenes,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider-man gone Darker for better or worst?!? Read Below ;),"The Amazing Spiderman – CATCH IT (A-) The anticipation for Spiderman movie was building from the time when Sam Raimi and Tobey MaGuire walked out of the franchise because of their creative differences with Sony. After that Sony decide to make a more Gothic and true to its origin Spiderman after huge critical and box office success of The Dark Night rises. Eventually Marc Jacobs, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone joint the reboot. The comparison between the original and reboot Spiderman movies is obvious. Marc Webb did try to make Spiderman as dark as he could have done and Andrew Garfield is defiantly is very talented. He did an impressive job as Peter Parker bringing the emotions which we rarely seen in comic book movie heroes even though he lacked the innocence of Tobey MaGuire's Peter Parker. Emma Stone is nice as always even with her blonde locks. Sally Fields, Martin Sheen, Rhys Ifans and Chris Zylka did a fine job. Though I have to say that Indian actor Irfan Khan was completely wasted and we never get to see for whom he was working and even though in deleted DVD scenes we see Lizard killing him in the tunnels but still no answer for the person he was working for. Finally, after watching the Amazing-Spiderman , I think the first Spider-Man movie was better as it had naive peter, cool organic webbing (even-though I understand the logic behind mechanical webbing) it was natural and animalistic or should d I say Insect-listic of him. The Amazing-Spider man was smart, witty and mouthy from start so when he got powers it was like Cherry on the Cake. The first one has better Villain the Green Goblin as it was rooted within the friendship of young Harry none-the-less Lizard was very real and graphics were spot-on but his logic to destroy and make everyone a Lizard was weird. Kirsten Dunst and Emma Stone both played different comic-book characters so comparison is not fair and since both Peter's had good chemistry with their girls. And now let's talk about ending there is no doubt Spider-Man's ending was Great from accidentally Green Goblin and leaving him his home and Harry walking in on him to saving Mary Jane and Kids at the same time to leaving Mary Jane for ever at funeral and from Mary Jane finding out he is spider-man with the Kiss. Everything was in big Spectacular way. So I did love The Amazing Spider-Man but the winner is Spider-Man Indeed!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
V.good movie!!!!,"The Amazing Spider-Man would prefer if you didn't call it the fourth Spider-Man movie. See, this ain't the Spider-Man your older brother knew from ten years ago — it's a reboot. The latest adventure to feature the comic book web slinger throws three movies worth of established mythology straight out the window, swapping the original cast with an ensemble of fresh faces and resetting the franchise with a spiffy new origin story.The movie has problem but those problems are passable. but after seeing this i m sure that the sequel will be much better than this part and also will be better than the Spiderman 2(2004).My verdict- *********",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Finally, story over smash and bash is back in style","First the Avengers and now this.After 15 years it seems story is finally back in style for superhero films. After so long with each film year after year trying to beat the last with it's bangs, effects, wow factor ad not much else.I've always measured the greatness of films by considering whether (or not) I would want to sit through a film again. A ""Favorite"" film of course I can watch dozens of times, etc.Before TASM, I cant think of a single superhero flick that's been released in the past 10 years that I have wanted to see again. At best I could get my gratification by watching a crucial five minutes but never be bothered sitting through the whole thing.TASM (despite its length) is a film I could sit through again - end to end. On so many levels it works and that's because there's attention to detail. Yes there's still those stupid unbelievable moments (now come on.. a lizard and a toilet?) but on the most part finally TASM puts science back into SciFi. The story tries so hard to explain why things are the way they are and watching this unfold (without having to tax the mind through plot twists) is entertaining indeed.TASM works because the hero is limited. Rules have been set as to what Spidey can (and can't) do and the producers have rigidly stuck by that rule book. That's something that was sadly lacking in the previous Spidey franchise where so much stuff went on without any explanation at all, every time the third act just became too unbelievable and any illusion was destroyed.TASM explores so many aspects that the original franchise either didn't want to touch or couldn't be bothered to because they were so busy proving they had the best special effects for the given week when they were produced. In TASM, you get the idea that it wouldn't matter what the effects looked like, the film would still stand up on it's own and be entertaining. It'll be a hard one to sequel.And the best thing is.. it really didn't cost that much to make now, did it guys. Geez 20 years ago we Aussies were making superflicks in this category for for $40m and we thought that was a lot of dosh. Then came Kevin Costly and his $200m flop and that seemed to set a new bench mark for how to waste insane sums of money in film that everyone has followed since.Now here's a superflick that cost less in todays' money than that Kevin Costly crap did 15 years ago and will easily make that back four times worldwide even if it doesn't win the US box office this week. All because they told a story instead of just making another long music video.I'm glad I lived long enough to see that there's still hope for superflicks. TASM (and The Avengers before it) will hopefully become part of a new breed that will finally sweep away the crap and result in films which anyone, anywhere can sit down and enjoy, end to end - just like the super hero flicks of long ago.ZM",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A New Spider-Man For A New Time Period,"Just recently, I did a review of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man from 2002. Now, I think it would be cool to have a look at the most recent reboot, The Amazing Spider-Man, directed by Marc Webb. After highly praising Spider-Man for it's comic book feeling scope and great take on the classic characters, what do I think of the revamp of my favorite superhero? I loved it, simply put. Sure, people will be comparing this one to the original, but to be honest, I really can't compare the two. I love them both evenly, but we are not here to compare the 2002 film and the 2012 film, we are here to talk about the 2012 reboot solely. So let's get started, shall we? Refill your web shooters, climb up the nearest wall and enjoy the review.I think what I like most about this film is that it combines the modern day Spider-Man with the Spider-Man of the past. As the original Spider-Man film was much like the Steve Ditko era comics, this film is a lot like the Ultimate Spider-Man stories from the last decade. There is a much more modernized look to the film and the characters act like real life people do nowadays. For example, Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker/Spidey is a much more sarcastic, outspoken fellow who does what a lot of teens do these days. He explores, he gets into it with his aunt and uncle, he listens to music, and he skateboards. He's a lot like the modern day teen, rebellious and free, just like all of us are in one way or another.This film also borrows key elements from the golden era, some elements that were even missing from the original Raimi film. Garfield's Spider-Man wields web shooters instead of organic webs and has his trademark sarcastic nature and attitude. Peter also has his first female flame from the comics, Gwen Stacy, who is portrayed by Emma Stone. She is a much more determined and headstrong female lead than Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane in the previous films, who always sat around, complaining about how Peter didn't support her or how Peter didn't care about her. I also liked Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors aka the Lizard, who comes off as a good man who just wanted to make a difference, but it ultimately turned him into a human reptile killing machine. Martin Sheen and Sally Field were also spectacular as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, and Dennis Leary is incredible as Gwen's father, Captain George Stacey. Unlike his comic book counterpart, Stacey despises Spider-Man and it takes him until the end of the film to finally trust him as the hero he really is.The Amazing Spider-Man is simply put, a New Spider-Man for a New Time Period. The audience who grew up with the original Raimi film are now much older, and a new audience will come in to cherish and savor this new take on the colorful hero. Some people who watched the original might even like this one better, for their opinions and perspectives have changed throughout the years. But I like both Spider-Man films and I hope that, in this new series of Spider-Man flicks, they keep the juices flowing and make Spider-Man retain what we admire him for.Oh, and one more thing. I like the look of Spidey's suit. It actually looks like something an average teenager would stitch together in a matter of minutes. Way to keep the film diverse from the original, Webb! The Amazing Spider-Man is an exciting treat overall.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An exciting new start for the Spiderman franchise,"Although this latest reboot of the Spider-Man franchise fails to hit the high notes that Raimi's Spider-man 2 did, and despite it falling significantly short of the Dark Knight trilogy, The Amazing Spider-Man is a promising new entry in the series. What remains most promising is the cast. Sheen does an excellent job as Ben Parker, as does Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey. Although Garfield does manages to evoke his status as a class above other teenage actors, he doesn't come off feeling quite as strong in the role of Peter Parker, although he does a better job then most would be able to. Unfortunately, this movies shortcomings are its rushed and sloppy editing, poor pacing and uninteresting villain. The Lizard is poorly rendered in CGI and his motives are never truly touched upon. Characters, including Oscorps Mr. Ratha's seem to come and go at random, and the lack of polish makes it feeling like a rushed process in the editing room. However, the effects are solid and breathtaking at times, the humour and acting is perfect, and you'll come out charmed by Marc Webb's distinctive take on The Amazing Spider-Man. The parts where Gwen and Peter interact are electric and feel similar to Webb's other movie, 500 Days of Summer. Overall I can highly recommend you go check out The Amazing Spider-Man and judge Marvel's latest reboot for yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not Amazing, but pretty damn Good.","Here's a little confession, I have not seen the Sam Raimi Spiderman movies. Nor have I read any of the comics, or really watched any form of media about him, I think I saw a few episodes of the old cartoon once, but that's about it. So unlike everyone else, I didn't go into this movie with ridicuously high expectations. And for me, this movie actually exceeded my expectations. I just wanted a fun movie, but this movie was actually a very well done, pretty emotional movie that still managed to be fun.There's quite a bit going on here, and because of this the film seems to forget about some of it's plot points. Maybe they were setting up for a sequel, but can we really just forget about some of these things that I won't spoil. And also because there is so much going on, sometimes it will either be going painfully slow, or feels rushed. I mean seriously it takes like 20 seconds after the bite and Peter already knows he has powers, but it takes almost a half hour after that for him to actually become Spider Man. Also some of the special effects weren't that great.But what I really liked was the characters in this movie. I actually really liked Peter, he came off as a real person. He was nice but was sarcastic, he was picked on, but he wasn't a nerd, he gets dramatic about the stuff going on in his life, but he has a sense of humor. There's a bit of an emotional pull to the movie involving his relationship with the other characters. Gwen was likable, she was what a good female lead should be: tough, smart, likable, funny, but even she can get into trouble. Half the time I forgot Emma Stone was playing her. And the villain was threatening, but kind of sympathetic. Despite some of the effects looking fake, most of them look pretty damn amazing. And it's just fun, that's one thing Marvel has over DC most of the time, they have a sense of fun to them. The movie is serious, but it's also a little campy, I mean there's only so serious that you can take a man dressed in that suit. It has a real fun sense of humor (including one of, if not the best Stan Lee Cameos), along with some fun action scenes. And as for the story, it's pretty basic, but it works.The Amazing Spider Man is definitely one of the better superhero orgin stories I've seen. Certainly more fun than Batman Begins and Iron Man. Despite some slow scenes, and some rushed scenes, the film manages to balance the seriousness of trying to make a superhero orgin story, and the fun that a comicbook movie like this should have. And while some people were disappointed, my expectaitons were actually surpassed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spider-Man Reloaded,"¨We all have secrets: the ones we keep... and the ones that are kept from us.¨Spider-Man is back with a reboot and although it seemed sort of early for it, Marc Webb did a great job with this film by refreshing the story and the characters. I enjoyed the first three Spider-Man films, although I wasn't a huge fan of them. Webb not only refreshed the series, but he also improved it in my opinion by doing one thing: getting Andrew Garfield to play Peter Parker. Garfield, who I really appreciated in The Social Network despite having flown under the radar in that movie, is excellent as Peter Parker. He has the right amount of charisma and wit that his character needs. I loved his performance much more than Tobey Maguire's. The other great addition to this reboot was the inclusion of Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, Peter's original love interest in the comics and who was played by Bryce Dallas Howard in the third film. Emma Stone is one of the greatest young talents on the screen and she is just lovely in this film and had great chemistry with Garfield. Webb had proved in the past that he could make a strong romantic film with his feature film debut, 500 Days of Summer, but I wasn't sure how the action was going to work out in The Amazing Spider-Man. The truth of the matter is that the action scenes were excellently choreographed and the film was visually stunning; I had a great time at the theater. I don't know if a reboot was absolutely necessary at this stage, but I had a fun time nonetheless.There are a few similarities between the original Spider-Man and this film, but for the most part screenwriters James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves chose a different approach in this version of the superhero story. They focused more on Peter Parker's (Andrew Garfield) troubles in school as a teenager and how he dealt with his parents death. After leaving him with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field), his parents never returned so Peter was raised by them with strong moral values. Despite having a great relationship with them, Peter is still hurt about the loss of his biological parents and is trying to deal with it as well as his growing feelings for his classmate Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). While trying to deal with all these normal teenage feelings, Peter discovers a forgotten briefcase of his father which contains some secrets about his past. Peter finds a picture of his father with Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), who used to be his good friend and science partner in Oscorp. That is when Peter decides to visit Oscorp and is bitten by a genetic spider. We all know the result of that spider bite: Peter becomes Spider-Man. As he tries to manage these new special abilities, Peter also befriends Dr. Connors in search for answers about his parents past. Peter deciphers an equation he found from his father's briefcase which allows Dr. Connors to make a huge advance in his genetic experiments, which ultimately leads to him becoming the Lizard, Spider-Man's nemesis.If you would've told me that the silly guy from Notting Hill would be playing The Lizard I would've thought it was a joke. Rhys Ifans is great in comedies, but I never imagined he could play an important villain with such success. The people behind the casting of this film did a tremendous job because every character seemed to be played by the perfect actor. I mean who better to play Captain Stacy than Denis Leary? Every role just fit perfectly and that was what ultimately made The Amazing Spider-Man such a fun film. Andrew Garfield with his unique wit and charm works almost in the same way that Robert Downey Jr. did as Tony Stark. It was as if these actors were born to play these roles. The entire cast was great in this film, so was the crew behind the special effects department. The film looks really good and is exactly what a summer blockbuster movie is supposed to be. The Amazing Spider-Man might not be as great as The Avengers, but it still was a really entertaining film worth the ticket price. Spider-Man fans will be pleased and I doubt anyone will be missing Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker after this performance, although I still have my reservations over whether or not a reboot of the series was necessary at this early stage.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Simple effective reboot of a comic-book staple,"Comic book movies in recent years have tended to be greeted with great regularity with the description 'darker' or variations thereof. This culminated with the excellent but 'darker' Dark Knight Rises, which bordered on pitch-black and outright depressing. However, the latest incarnation of the Spiderman movie series, the reboot Amazing Spiderman has followed in the footsteps of The Avengers by lightening up and getting back to the roots of the comic, with puns and one-liners galore giving the film a much more entertaining vibe than the convoluted and take-themselves-too-seriously original trilogy. However, the comedy generally doesn't overshadow the story too much, and themes of loss and isolation are more deftly dealt with, making this new Marvel superhero film a more rounded experience, which again paves the way for yet another franchise.The Amazing Spiderman, which was born from Sam Raimi's aborted Spiderman 4 and wiped the slate clean of Tobey Maguire's stories, goes back to the beginning and focuses on Peter Parker's schooldays - a time period largely glossed over in the original films. Science again plays a big part in the genesis of both Spiderman and his latest nemesis - the Lizard. This time however, the science doesn't even attempt to make itself plausible, resulting in explanation that can be just accepted blithely without too much head-scratching. Otherwise, the story follows the -by-now standard origin story format, so no prizes for guessing any plot twists (such as they are): Hero starts life as an outsider in school, aptitude for science, freakish pseudo-scientific incident, tragic loss, responsibility of new powers, etc etc. Everyone knows how the story goes, yet seeing how it gets started is always enjoyable in comic-book adaptations, and this one is no different.In the perfectly-named Marc Webb's reboot, the red and blue spandex is taken on by Andrew Garfield, while Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy replaces Kirsten Dunst's Mary-Jane as the webslinger's love interest. Both do an adequate job, although Garfield is perhaps too perfectly groomed, buffed and coiffed to play the geeky, nerdy wimp that is Spiderman's alter ego. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are perfectly suitable as Garfield's surrogate parents, but the real standout of the piece is Rhys Ifans - of Notting Hill and 51st State fame - in a surprisingly understated and effective performance as Dr Curt Connors, the hero's mentor-come-reptilian nemesis.There are many things to enjoy about this latest Spiderman film, including allowing Parker to be a teenager, complete with requisite teen angst, school issues and romance, and there are also some interesting and amusing explorations of the hero's controversial new mechanical web-shooters, making Peter Parker 2.0 a more interesting superhero than Maguire's slightly one-dimensional responsibility-burdened Tarzan-with-webbing. The neat references to the comic-book lore are interesting and deft, without being hidden away so only the true comic book nerds notice them. However, with a run time of over 2 hours, the time taken for the iconic costume to make its first appearance does seem to drag at times, while the lack of the Jonah Jameson-type character feels like a hole in the story.Interestingly, given the somewhat lightened tone of this new Spiderman film, the music has changed from a largely bombastic and anthemic rock soundtrack to a more cerebral classical-led score, with only Coldplay the solitary nod to pop music. Yet somehow this counterbalances the comedic touches that threaten occasionally to drag the first half of the film down into parody, resulting in a well-rounded film. Overall, while it is unlikely this film will win any original screenplay awards, particularly given the mere decade that has passed since the original, The Amazing Spiderman is an enjoyable entry into Marvel's comic book film adaptation canon, dealing deftly with the familiar themes without beating the audience over the head with them like Thor's sledgehammer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The 'Amazing' Spiderman and nothing less!,"This movie was a very special movie for me, because I grew up on the character Spiderman. I was very emotionally tied to the film and I held back tears at the end from how good it actually was.This movie does a great job of establishing the many things that create Peter Parker as a whole without making it too cheesy. They incorporated Peter's passion of photography, his desire for vengeance of Uncle Ben's death, his love for Aunt May, his crush on Gwen Stacey, his loser status in school. One of the best things about the film was that even though it was a Superhero movie there was real emotional attachment and each character had their own story. This movie did, by far, the best job out of all of the superhero movies to create an actual story where the protagonist wasn't someone you just idolized but someone that you understood. Then you add the classic action element and love subplot and you get this amazing movie. I will be one of the first to admit that I was not that excited when they said they were rebooting the series but after watching this movie I can tell you that it was one of the best movies of the year and if you have not seen it yet, whether you like Spiderman or not, you need to go out of your way to watch it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A movie for those suffering from selective amnesia.,"Watching The Amazing Spider-man was like sleepwalking into a multiplex screen and waking up jolted in your seat. You won't remember how you time traveled 10 years backwards, to watch Spider-man swing across his not-so-friendly-neighbourhood in his old red and blue spandex outfit.You'll feel like you are reliving those two and half hours of your life once again, but only this time it gets excruciatingly painful to watch it entirely.The original Spider-man was adapted to the screen so well that the new writers seem to have seamlessly traced the story with a carbon paper for the 2012 audience.Peter Parker can't get laid in high school. A Spider humps Parker. Uncle Ben dies preaching about responsibility. The Villain is a madcap scientist. Lather, rinse, repeat. Nothing changes in the reboot except for the cast and crew.The story has so many loose ends that you could tie them into a long plait. The makers think it is OK to allow Irfan Khan missing from the movie after a brief cameo. And the Mr. Osborne, who Irfan constantly keeps referring to, is a ghost character. Peter Parker's parents are a new addition to the story, but nobody bothers searching for them after they go missing years ago.The amount of Batman references are too obvious not to notice. If Jim Gordon had a daughter, then Spider-man doesn't live too faraway from Gotham City. The city police chief's daughter is Spidey's new love interest. They join forces to defeat the villain. The villain - a giant green lizard - chooses Osborne tower to spread his airborne virus which is pretty much similar to Batman Begins ending.Watching it 3D had its advantages like getting to actually feel what it would be like to jump off rooftops from dizzying heights. The first- person camera view of Spider-man in action is a decent addition to the reboot. However, The Amazing Spider-man manages to fail on all three levels when compared to its predecessors.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Surprised, much more of the Spidey I grew up with!!! Short mini review","Firstly I have to say I just got back from seeing The Amazing Spider-ManI'm happy to report I really did enjoy the film and totally give full credit to Andrew Garfield for his performance as Peter Parker/Spider- man.I was worried when I saw the first trailer, I thought it would be ruined and a waste of a film, but I'm glad to be wrong.My only issue is I would have thought Spider-man would have natural swinging ability (Instead of custom built ones)Overall I thought it was very very good, perhaps not everyone's idea for an Amazing Spider-Man movie but its realistic (to a point) the effects work well, the fight scenes are not over or under done and the cast and their performances were excellentHope they all reunite for another Spidey and keep the franchise alive",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than the Avengers (in my opinion)! Exceeded my expectations!,"Honestly, spiderman is not one of my favorite superheroes, but after seeing this movie, I really hope they make a sequel soon. From the previews, I felt like this spiderman movie would be the best yet, and it certainly was! It exceeded my expectations! The casting was spot on. The casting choices for female roles in these superhero movies have been very disappointing to me, but I felt like Emma Stone was a great choice --- a breath of fresh air. Andrew Garfield really made Peter Parker shine! I've never heard of this guy until I saw this movie. He was a brilliant choice. I felt like I could really connect with the character and Andrew gave the character a lot of depth. This movie is worth watching many times over, and I'm definitely putting it on my list of favorite superhero movies. I only hope the new Batman movie can live up to this movie, and I've been a Batman fan since I was probably 6 or 7 years old. The Amazing Spiderman tops all of the movies made with Tobey Maguire. Sorry Tobey! Marvel's making better choices in my opinion. The Hulk in the Avengers was the best so far, and Andrew Garfield in the Amazing Spiderman, is the best spiderman. I recommend this movie for the whole family.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing just about fits the bill.,"A critic once wrote that it is impossible to fathom anyone else portraying Spiderman other than Tobey Macguire. He'd willingly take back his words now. Garfield's Spiderman remarkably stands out in the instinctive humor which he displays, the sort of humor conspicuous by its absence in Tobey's Spiderman. The latter I admit was great in the first two movies but he didn't quite display any sarcastic behaviorism which we comic lovers really adore him for. The chemistry between Garfield and Stone is also great and becomes more watchable considering that they are real life lovers too. Gwen Stacy is quite different and a refreshing change from Mary Jane of the previous movies. MJ was more of the usual damsel in distress who had to be there so as to keep Spidey in business. This time around Gwen might be another character vulnérable, but having a more headstrong personality and is a mainstay in the film. The film explores much of Peter's life before he actually dons the role of the web crawler for which he is destined. This ploy of a gradual build up to the more exciting stuff in the latter half of the movie made for a great viewing. Also the 3D must have been the best amongst all movies I have seen since Avatar. I'd say ""Amazing"" just about fits the bill for this one.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Weaving the way out,"The webs of justice are sticking everywhere and the one weaving them is back more powerful than ever. The story of Peter Parker and his inner struggle to understand the past, while bearing an infinite strength to face the future has taken a different turn. It surprises and amazes.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is beautifully done and, in spite of the fact that I also love Raimi's lighter take on the bug boy's life, this next chapter has managed to get my attention with its fresher look. It doesn't really match the adult approach that Nolan was able to give Batman, but it still brings a 'je-ne-sais-quois' to the big screen. It has a lot of action, incredible swinging scenes and Garfield, as the super hero, turns out to be a great cast. He is talented enough to depict the difficult young man's life and effort to keep up with things he doesn't understand. Great fun for anyone who's willing to let go of stress to embark in a big adventure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An edgy and mediocre reboot of Spidey that no one needed.,"I'm not a Sam Raimi fanboy or elitist. I liked Raimi's original trilogy but it's not perfect. And Spider-Man 3 was OK. But I really wanted to like this movie, but I didn't. I have my limits when it comes to dark versions of classic characters and this movie just passes through them. For Spider-Man, this is way too dark. There is some light-hearted stuff here, but I just can't enjoy this movie with how dark it gets. If it was like Spider-Man 2 then maybe I could enjoy it a lot more because Spider-Man 2 along with Avengers: Infinity War manage to put Spider-Man in a dark setting whilst still making it enjoyable and fun to watch with some great drama. This movie just tries too hard with blood, a grim and dark setting, hell, the POSTER for this movie pretty much summarises why I dislike it so much. Other than the unneeded edgyness, the soundtrack was fine, the cast is OK (but Andrew Garfield does not fit Peter Parker at all), and the action is decent enough. But this movie just gives off such a weird and depressing vibe when it's a movie about one of the most light-hearted, fun and cheesy comic book characters of all time. It may be a technically fine movie, but I just can't enjoy it with how much they try and make Spider-Man edgy and dark.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing!,"Prepare to be amazed? Well I certainly was! This was an awesome re-boot of the movie franchise and I was very impressed. I have been a Spider-Fan for years now, and was highly anticipating Spidey's new release. Andrew Garfield does a better job than Tobey Maguire, simply because Garfield looks more like Peter does in the original comics, it was also lovely to see Gwen Stacey introduced in the beginning, like she should have been in the 'Tobey' Trilogy. Beautiful plot line, nice level of sarcastic humor, brilliant CG and stunts, awesome costume re-design, hilarious cameo by Stan Lee, simply amazing! I loved the film! Well done Marvel! <3",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"While not quite ""amazing"", ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a good, solid and very fun (albeit unneeded) reboot, and has made me excited for a potential new series...","I should go into this review stating that I wasn't really looking forward to this film. I was 14 when Sam Raimi's 2002 release ""Spider- Man"" came out, and his initial trilogy (featuring two sequels released in 2004 and 2007) truly and completely wowed me as a teen-aged film-goer and captured my imagination in a way that few films had done before.When Sony decided to trash the planned ""Spider-Man 4"" and instead focus on this reboot, I was a bit crest-fallen. I wanted more Sam, Toby, Kirsten, etc. But, as more and more details came out, and I saw the first images and trailers, I steadily gained interest, bit-by-bit. However, I was never eagerly anticipating this film, so when my best friend handed me a ticket for the midnight screening (from which I've just come), I was only half-excited.I'm glad I went, however, because despite being completely unneeded, this reboot is actually very, very good!Mark Webb directs this tale, from a script by Alvin Sargent, James Vanderbilt and Steve Kloves.Essentially an origin story (at times frustratingly and detrimentally similar to the 2002 film, but different enough to stay fairly fresh), this film follows Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), a young man in high school whose parents left him when he was a child, following a bizarre break-in at his scientist-father's home. Now living with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen), Peter is a quirky geek in school. After discovering some of his father's old files, he tracks down a former co-worker of his to Oscorp, where he works. There, Peter is accidentally bitten by a genetically-engineered spider, giving him bizarre superhuman powers.After a tragedy, Peter decides to use these powers for good, and becomes Spider-Man. At the same time, Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), the man who used to work with Peter's father, is inadvertently transformed into a hulking Lizard-like creature, and Peter (with the help of his crush, Gwen Stacy, as played by Emma Stone) must stop him at all costs from destroying the city.The film is very well-made. The script is well-written and paced, and the dialog is certainly a lot fresher than the Raimi films. (Which suffered from some hammy lines) Webb's direction is also top-notch, going for a darker, edgier and slightly more realistic style than the former films. (Though I did prefer Raimi's camera-work slightly more) And the visual effects and design are awe-inspiring. Spidey looks startlingly real in this film, as compared to the plastic-y look of the last trilogy. And the design of his costume and the villainous lizard, in addition to the incredible sets, it quite nice. (Don't listen to other reviews who claim it is ""Twilight""-like. I've forced myself to watch those films, and this is nothing like them, whatsoever. Those reviews are extremely inaccurate.)The acting is also outstanding. Garfield is phenomenal as Peter, giving him much more of sense of humor than previous on-screen incarnations. Emma Stone is great as Gwen, giving her a believability and adorable likability. Ifans is menacing, but slightly under-utilized as Connors/Lizard- he does a good job with his performance, but isn't given enough to do. Sheen and Fields make Ben and May extremely lovable and identifiable. And other roles by the likes of Denis Leary and Chris Zylka are great.That praise being said, there are some big problems. For starters, the film does feel a little stale, simply because only 10 years ago, we saw this exact same origin story on screen, with only some differences. It was hard to sit through it again, only about 5 years since the last film. Also, there are some problems with the story- certain plot lines are dropped halfway through (including the important search for a man responsible for hurting Peter in an unforgivable way), and some characters are neglected when the pace picks up, giving it a slightly uneven feel. The action is far too abbreviated, with most of the battle scenes lasting between 30 seconds and two minutes, which was a tad anti-climactic. Also, the score by James Horner, while admirable, cannot compare to Danny Elfman and Christopher Young's masterful work from the first trilogy.That being said, I was still extremely impressed with this film, and shocked at how well it worked and how much I loved it. I was worried that it wouldn't hold a candle to the Raimi trilogy, but this proved that Spidey is in good hands, and I'd say this film is as good as Raimi's first film. (Although not as good as 2004's ""Spider-Man 2"", which was one of those rare, perfect superhero movies.) I'm very excited at the prospect of sequels to this film, and while I wish we had gotten the planned ""Spider-Man 4"" instead, this is still a very good film, and has made a believer out of me.I give ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" a very good 8 out of 10. It isn't perfect, but it's a web of adventure and excitement that you'll want to take a swing through at least once. Check it out!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marc Webb - U did a Great Job,"Well let me tell u guys, i am not any critics or someone who criticize someone's work. But after reading so many negative feedback, i just want to tell one thing as a viewer as a public, I like this movie very much not cos i am a great fan of spider man ( Partially I am :D ) but just cos the direction of Mr Marc Webb. Just AWESOME. What a Direction. AMAZING. I am not comparing this movie with the last 3 movies of spider man, With all due respect those parts are all great but what i like most in this movie is Transparency between the characters and between the relations that they are holding. Even now i have a thought in my mind, what if Mr. Webb direct the Transformer - 4, trust me that will be a WORTH TO WATCH movie. Anyways 10/10...For Mr. Webb.Andrew & Emma look cute together.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's more difficult to be 'Amazed' by certain things you've seen before...,"... but, other than that bit of false advertising, I'd still say that this was a solid enough first step down a new avenue.* Better acting (in my opinion)* It shows more of his childhood, and how he's raised.* There's more focus on the web-slinging, acrobatic side of things... The costume has been changed so that Spidey appears more streamlined... I approve of this alteration. Raimi's SM hangs together better in terms of story, but TASM had better individual moments.They're all worthy films, in my opinion... It's just a little bit of a shame that they were made so close together.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Batman Begins of Spiderman,"Okay, I've read all of the old comics. Watched all of the old movies, i liked Tobey McGuire's performance as Spidey but THIS Spiderman did something special: it made him a teenager.Tobey's Spider-man was great, but he lacked that spirit that Peter had. Sure he was nerdy and acted like it but he wasn't a teenager. Anndrew Garfield is the definitive Peter Parker and Spidey. When Tobey first gets bitten by the radioactive spider, he seems to already know that he needs to be responsible and doesn't really learn anything. With Garfield he shows that even if he does have powers he is STILL a teenager and abuses his power and is trying to rid himself of the guilt and sadness of losing Uncle Ben and his parents. He's flawless, because he shows that human childish side that McGuire never had because that interpretation was a bit different and he was a little old.Emma Watson as Gwen Stacy is PERFECT. She embodies her so well and the relationship she has with Peter is so sweet and beautiful and i bought it. It's not that i didn't like Mary Jane but i always preferred Gwen because she never whined and always stood by Peter even at his worst, but that's just my opinion.Conner is great, he really captures how he didn't want to be the Lizard, *SPOILERS* at least at the end of the movie.In short The Amazing Spider-man just pulled a Batman Begins and embodied everything that Spider-man is supposed to be, this brilliant.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Time for another reboot,"Only 5 years after the last episode of the outstanding first trilogy , it was a strange decision from Marvel in the first place to launch a reboot of Spiderman.But the marketing surrounding the film lead you to think they knew what they were doing : A darker, more realistic Spidey and a new take on the origin of the hero seemed attractive enough.Yet, strangely, the movie is less dark and far less realistic than the original and the story of the origin is confusing and uninteresting at best.The major problem is that every aspect of this film (the acting, the characters, the love story, the villain, even the opening credits and the cliffhanger...) is too generic and flat to raise any interest.Even Andrew Garfield's strange acting, that fit so good in other movies, was so forced here that I felt embarrassed in many scenes.The plot is sometimes very confusing and often completely illogical.There were a few interesting ideas but they are too briefly or poorly exploited.If you are, like me, a fan of the Sam Raimi's trilogy, do yourself a favor and crush this unnecessary spider.It is just another triumph of marketing over substance.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing,"This movie is one of the best superhero reboots of all time. The director nailed it in terms of emotional depth, entertainment, humor and action. Some people expect unrealistic things, and they should know that this is the 1st movie in a new trilogy, and should not be compared to the Sam Raimi films. They were good no doubt, but this movie was even BETTER. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, the tone, the pace, the lighting, cgi, action, and character development was specially taken care of. If you loved Toby Maguire as Spiderman, you'll find Andrew Garfield to be even better. Emma Stone is also wonderful as Gwen Stacy, and MUCH better than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Check this movie out with an open mind, and you'll for sure come out amazed. The most 'amazing' part of the movie, is that the human touch was added to the characters, and you could actually be believe that a Spiderman like that could exist in our world. Truly awesome movie, and cant wait for the sequel!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Surprising Treat for Spider-Man Fans Everywhere!,"I've read the first page of reviews people wrote for this movie, and honestly, I think you're all overreacting and making a pre-conceived assumption about it! I went to see this movie during the summer, and I saw the 3D presentation of it. As much as I enjoyed Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, this movie turned out to give off a better impression.Character and story development was the biggest improvement because we really got to know Peter Parker as a person very well, and we actually got to see how he ended up living with his aunt and uncle, as opposed to in the 2002 movie, where he's already living with them, and his parents are never mentioned, as if we're simply supposed to accept that he lives with them, his relationship with Uncle Ben is a lot stronger and we actually feel sorry for him when his uncle dies, which was rather hard to do in the original movie, his love interest, Gwen Stacey, is a lot smarter, stronger, and much more likable and interesting than Mary Jane Watson ever was, because she wasn't just some damsel in distress, and also in this film, when Peter develops his superpowers, he actually has a real reaction to them, instead of just quickly adjusting to them and acting like being genetically mutated is normal. For those who think Tobey Magure played Peter Parker/Spider-Man better than Andrew Garfield, you couldn't be more wrong, I personally liked Andrew Garfield's performance, and he wasn't better or worse than Tobey Maguire, it's just 2 different takes on the same character, that's all.The one real downside to this film is the villain, the Lizard, and that's because even though he has a motivation, he's boring and doesn't come across as a menacing threat in any forceful way, but that's not a big enough flaw to really drag the movie down. I will say that even though he has a device for the web-slinging, I think the way he could do it naturally in the original trilogy was more exciting. Director Marc Webb did a great job of telling what is essentially the same story over again, but in a more complex and in-depth way, and the special effects were really top-notch. I can't wait for the sequel to this film, cause it truly deserves one.All in all, The Amazing Spider-Man is one of the best superhero films I've ever seen, and it's really great for those who want to know and understand Peter's character better, as well as see a more accurate telling of his story. 9/10 in my book!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It is the worst movie i have seen this year. It is an insult to spider man and his fans .... What awful acting by Andrew Garfield, Emma stone and the other actors as well. Spider man (2002) was 100000 times better than this . Really lousy directing i have seen bad Hindi movies this year but this one beats all i don't know who made Mark Webb a director.

"I'd like to call it ""The Spectacular Spider-Man"" has some flaws, but it's still a great film on it's own.","Reboot can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the situation. For Batman, we received from Christopher Nolan without a doubt the greatest Super Hero trilogy ever, With Clash of the Titans, not really. But what about our Friendly Neighborhood? well with the conclusion of the 3rd film, the details of the villains and Sam Raimi stepping back from the project makes sense for Sony to reboot rather then making a fourth Installment of the Raimi trilogy.Well now we have the The Amazing Spider-Man reboot finally upon us. Is it really Amazing, It's damn close to it. The thing that works about the film is bringing parts of the comic to life, one of them being Peter Parkers first love Gwen Stacy to the big screen rather then Mary Jane Watson, The actual Timeline rather then the popularity of the characters. Comparing to Christopher Nolan's Batman films which have a politics theme to it, The Amazing Spider-Man lives within the world of Biochemistry and digs more the background behind Peter Parker like never before. Peter Parker who is portrayed by ""The Social Networks"" star Andrew Garfield and ""Easy A"" star Emma Stone put their heart into the character's Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, this is one of the strongest points of the movie, and the rest of the cast is also just as strong as the protagonists, Sally Wield actual surprised me as Aunt May, so is Dennis Leary portrayal to Captain Stacy is also an incredible achievement from this cast, and Rhys Ifans portrayal as the antagonist Dr Connors (The Lizard) which for some moments demonstrates this two personalities in one person, similar to what we seen in Norman Osborn from the Spidey film of 2002.The transformation of Peter Parker to Spider Man, is also quite well filmed especially when you see him trying to control his powers, it's both interesting, intense and comical. And it's not only when he was bitten by the Radioactive spider, but also how he starts to fight crimes, his web slinging practice, the process of his costume creation which is also very well detailed.Although the film was made for 3D, it does take some good advantages and some creative steps that make use for the character Spider-Man, one of my favorite moments was entering in first person view during the web slinging which collaborated with the films use of the 3D makes you feel that you were inside of the mind of Spider-Man, the problem though they're are very few moments of these which is pity because they put a creative use for the character Spider-Man in a 3D film.Some of the issues of the film though concern with the film is probable the fact that it feels slow at points, that's not saying that the film is slow in action, but how the Origin of Spider-Man does take place quite a period before he starts his life as Spider-Man. also is the fact that they're are some plot points that really aren't resolved in the film but it makes you feel that it will be answered for a sequel. Besides that there are some changes that are very different from the comics and the Raimi films, however it's not really an issue at all, because It's a reboot and takes liberty to do what could be interesting points, one of them is how Peter is inspired by creating the Spider-Man mask.The film even though it's quite serious and focuses the darkness of Peter Parker, it also has some enjoyable humor that is straight from the Spider-Man comics.I know at this moment, people are more interested in watching The Dark Knight Rises, however The Amazing Spider-Man is still a spectacular adventure and serves as an excellent reboot, despite some flaws, Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield should be praised for what they both have done in the film, they are one of the strongest points of the film along with the solid cast, If you have a chance to watch this Spectacular film then I would highly recommend this movie. I seriously can't wait for a sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Creative new spin on a  modern-day American fairy tale that doesn't stray far from the heart of the classic origin.,"Studio: Columbia/Sony Cast: Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Martin Sheen, Sally Field Rating: PG-13 Running Time: 136 minutesOne of the only strikes against ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is the fact it's a reboot of a very popular and successful film series. That's an issue only because in a summer where two of the biggest comic book based franchises ( ""The Avengers"", ""The Dark Knight Rises"")  compete to break and set box office records, few were excited about a do-over of the film series that takes the audience back to the beginning of an already well known story.Unfortunately, the very capable Sam Raimi, director of the first three Spider-Man films and Columbia/Sony couldn't agree on several aspects of the future of the franchise so instead of moving ahead with a fourth installment the studio immediately began production on this ""re- imaging"".The gamble paid off as ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" creatively puts a new spin on a story so well known that it is practically a modern-day American fairy tale.From the opening scene, the score reveals that the tone of the film is going to be much darker than the Toby McGuire/ Kirsten Dunst vehicle.Since the majority of the characters have been well established on screen over the past 10 years (nevermind the past 50 years of comic book history) in order for the latest film to succeed it was imperative for the new cast to totally own their roles beginning with Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) as the new Peter Parker.He does an excellent job not only establishing himself as the iconic alter-ego of Spider-Man but he also successfully reinvents the personality of Peter Parker. At the core of the character is his witty one-liners which Garfield delivers with the comic timing of comedy veterans like Billy Crystal. His Peter is still a super smart teen and sort of a square peg but Garfield manages to infuse an aura of cool never before been seen in the character.Denis Leary and Rhys Ifans seamlessly take over roles previously played by James Cromwell and Dylan Baker as police Captain Stacy and Dr. Curt Conner - relatively minor characters on the previous films. However in this movie both are major protagonists. In Ifans case, he also introduces Conner's alter-ego -The Lizard; a bad guy out of Spidey's rouge gallery whose origins are directly tied to Spider-Man's.The extremely talented Emma Stone (The Help) takes over the role of Gwen Stacy played previously by Bryce Dallas Howard. However, this film (staying true to the comic) introduces Gwen as Peter's first love interest. Stone and Garfield demonstrate chemistry that in the midst of all the action tells a sweet teenage love story.Director Marc Webb consulted with 3D guru James Cameron during the planning process which led to the movie bring filmed in digital 3D rather than converted post-production. This brings clarity and crispness to the scenes and the special effects that doesn't detract from nor overwhelm a surprisingly well written script.(Audiences should be aware that beginning with this movie Sony is charging theaters for the 3D glasses which will undoubtedly result in higher prices at the ticket office. Is the additional price justified? Here's a great article to help you decide.)While the writers took some artistic license and modernized some elements of Spider-Man's beginnings, the story essentially doesn't stray far from the heart of the classic origin.Many have said they aren't as excited about this movie as they were/are about the other summer  blockbusters. Had anyone known how good of a movie this would turn out to be I'm sure the Web Crawler's ticket pre-sale would have rivaled all the other heroes of the big screen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Do you have any idea what you really are making? Twilight Romance or Action, adventure film","Saw an early preview. After watching this I think even 3rd one was way better then this. Actually is a Twilight like romance film about Peter Parker. Spider-Man is just there for a little time to attract more viewers. I went for a action adventure film instead I got a love story. Previously I thought Ghost Rider 2 was worst film this year now its Amazing Lame Spider Man. This really happens when you hire a director whose only film is a low budget Romance film. This movie just made me sick, how can you even fool audience by giving a Romance film packaged as an action film. Whatever 3D was used was decent but, climax with Lizard was not anything special. CGI looks very fake and cheesy. The effects in this film are only comparable to first Spider-Man, second and third was way beyond this league. I don't know who was the master mind to green light this script. Because this will not attract the core Spidey fans, but if the studio wanted to attract the Twilight audience they might be successful. To conclude I hope this is the end of Spider-Man and its rights go back to Marvel and Disney so we can see Real Spider Man in near future.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

As we've seen, Andrew Garfield has successfully delivered an amazing performance, his acting is great in the movie. One obvious fact, Garfield is a sanguine person, and he brings it up into his character. Now we have a sanguine Spider-man, more cheerful and more charismatic.I'm also touched by the romantic scenes and friendship scenes in the movie. You all should watch this movie, and find out whether we'll share the same effects from those scenes.....

A sublime superhero film with its heart in the right place!,"The new Spider-Man is truly amazing! One would ideally give the verdict in the latter half of the review, but I'd rather say it right at the beginning.What a great year it is turning out to be for fans of superhero franchises! First we had 'The Avengers', now we get 'The Amazing Spider- Man' and July 20 shall see the final chapter of Chris Nolan's Batman ""rise""!A reboot and prequel of sorts, it is inevitable that most of us compare Mark Webb's Spider-Man to the previous Spider-Man trilogy directed by Sam Raimi, starring Tobery Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. Is it as good as Raimi's 'Spider-Man' which came out about 10 years back in 2002? How similar, different or better is it?The basic plot of Webb's reboot stays the same so don't go expecting major novelty in the first half.A young Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) finds himself lonely and attracted to classmate Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). His friends bully him while as caretakers; aunt and uncle expect him to be more responsible. Amidst all this, a spider bits him, turning Peter Parker into Spider- Man, a helpful vigilante.Webb however modifies Peter's character traits and makes him more interesting, intriguing, even a tad immature. He has no qualms in declaring that he is not morally obligated or responsible to make everyone happy. Unlike Maguire, Garfield is not saintly, shy, conscious or extreme nerdy before or after he dons his spidey outfit. He makes mistakes, loses his cool, exploits his super powers, speaks his heart out, prefers being aloof. He even lets Gwen know right from the beginning that he fancies her...so no 'good friends' drama there fortunately.Webb also makes his love interest more appealing and less annoying. Unlike Mary Jane, Gwen is not a spineless damsel in distress. She is not an indecisive emotional fool either. She reads Peter's mind and knows what she needs to do. She even fights, risks her life to save Peter. The biggest highlight of the film is the sizzling chemistry between Garfield and Emma. The real life couple looks great together on screen too. Their love story makes you smile. Their terrace kiss is as special as the upside down kiss in Spider-Man (2002). Garfield shoots his web on Emma, pulls her towards him, grabs her in his arms and leans in for a kiss... iconic indeed.As far as the bad guys are concerned, Rhys Ifans plays Dr Connors who becomes a huge dinosaur like lizard, thus a huge threat to Spider-Man. He is not entirely a villain though. Even with limited screen time, Emma Stone is very charming & impressive as Peter's love interest. Irrfan Khan has just about two scenes, but he does get noticed & is likely to return for the sequel.The special effects, cinematography, stunts are mind-blowing. The very first scene where Peter starts discovering his newly found powers on a moving train is superbly shot. The action in the school fight & climax is incredible too. As for Spidey's trademark web-swinging, this has easily the BEST web-swinging sequences ever conceived, take my word for that. And if you are watching this in 3D, Imax viewing would be awesome. Even as Spider-Man shoots his web in the air, you will literally dodge to avoid being his target! The 3D is not gimmicky & is used mainly in the action sequences.Last and not the least, Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man is supremely charming. With his expressive face & body language, he looks the part both as Peter Parker & Spiderman. He makes us forget that Tobey Maguire played the same character in 3 successful films before! He executes his role differently with no resemblance to Tobey. He is rebellious, vulnerable, romantic, amateur (he works on his web powers as they don't come naturally to him), practices before becoming a pro at flying and falling from skyscrapers. He even googles his unforgiving spandex outfit before zeroing in on one.If you are a true Spiderman fan, you would be glad to welcome him back in the new avatar. This is the second best Spiderman film, after Spiderman 2. Its easily better than the first & third Spiderman films helmed by Sam Raimi.Verdict: Simply amazing - 8.5/10!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An emotional drama; Big let down in superhero movie series,"Why the heck they had reinvented the story (like how Parker became Spidey, how uncle Ben died). First one hour of the movie was a rerun of incidents already shown in 1-3 series. The story is full of loose ends (who owns the Oscorp manufacturing company, what happens to the Indian guy, was waiting till the end to know what happened to Parker's parents and still no clue). The effects were also better in the first three series. Liked only two things about the movie - Andrew & Emma's pairing and the very last flight of Spidey. It was definitely an emotion-packed (and repeats-packed) movie but I guess I was expecting a super fast superhero stuff. Where the world is moving on to 4G, this movie was speeding in 1G itself.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Massive Improvement,"'The Amazing Spiderman' is a film that has been greatly anticipated but has also made a lot of people worry. The re-boot of the franchise so quickly after Sam Raimi's attempt seems ridiculous as there is not really a new generation of children yet to be introduced to Spiderman since 'Spiderman 3' was just released in 2007. I think director Marc Webb has taken this opportunity to fix what was wrong with the previous trilogy.The script is great, the film promised more information relating to Peter Parker's back-story i.e. what happened to his parents but you do not get a great deal of NEW information. Compared to Raimi's trilogy there are only a few extra bits in the beginning. Aside from that, the story is different because it sees Spiderman deal with a new villain, the Lizard. The whole story was well-written and the Lizard had a lot to do with Parker's identity.The acting was good, Andrew Garfield is already far better than Tobey Maguire. I think this may be because the film focuses on Parker's life in high school rather than in adult life so you see him in some scenes behaving like a real teenager which is great. Rhys Ifans was good but not great, he did portray both sides of his character well but I think there was a lot of room for improvement there. Emma Stone was really good; she played the love interest of Spiderman very well if you compare it to Kirsten Dunst's performance in the previous trilogy where she had no on-screen presence whatsoever.One thing that was really impressive was the special effects, they tried to use as little CGI as possible when it came to stunts but for scenes where Spiderman is swinging through the air it did look a lot more realistic, unlike Raimi's trilogy where scenes like this would look too weightless, thankfully in this film they have managed to sort this out so it really does look like it is a real person swinging through the air. The effects used to create the Lizard were very well done too, the whole design of the villain was great, particularly the face which looked very creepy, especially when he spoke.Overall, I would recommend this film as it is a massive improvement on the previous trilogy. If you've not seen a Spiderman film before this is a great place to start. Andrew Garfield is a great superhero and I can't wait to see what they do next.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This a great movie.,This reboot is better then the first 3 Spider man movies. This is a great movie. It has great acting. It also has special effects. This one of the best action movie ever. It is better then The Dark Knight. It is a great movie. See it. It is one of the best movie ever. Spider man home coming is better.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic and still realistic,"Men in tights still draw people in. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone star in the newest Marvel film, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". Peter Parker (Garfield) is a nerdy, awkward teenager whose parents disappeared when he was ten years old. He now lives with his aunt (Sally Field) and uncle (Martin Sheen). When rummaging through an area of his basement, Peter finds his father's briefcase, which holds a clue that will open the door to unlimited scientific possibilities.This clue leads him to Dr. Curt Connors, a scientist at Oscorp who used to work with Peter's father. Gwen Stacy (Stone), one of Peter's schoolmates, happens to work at Oscorp as well. While snooping through Connors' lab, Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider that brings him supernatural powers, which he decides to use for good. He creates a suit for himself and claims the name, Spider-Man.Being that this film is another Marvel superhero film, I was expecting to see aliens or portals to other worlds. However, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" stays on a realistic level by presenting the scientific descriptions of Spider-Man's powers and the creation of The Lizard. Of course, you have to use your imagination for some aspects, but you have to remember that this was originally a comic book.One of the few complaints about this movie is the fact that the first ""Spider-Man"" was released just ten years ago. Many believe that remaking the series is unnecessary. To respond to that, I say that most of the people who are watching ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" are not the people who watched the first series. I was seven years old in 2002 and I didn't know the Spider-Man series even existed.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" greatly impressed me. My eyes were glued to the screen and I didn't want it to end. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Masterpiece!,"When i first heard 2 years ago that this movie is coming out, i was surprised as much i loved firs two Raimi's films i didn't like the third one in my opinion Spider-man 3 is BORING and it was sad to look at retarded Pete Parker. I was hoping for an fourth one but instead we got a reboot.In my opinion first 20 minutes of this movie are batter then whole original trilogy.And main reason is because of Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield he is much batter SPIDER-MAN than its predecessor Tobey Maguire. And Emma Stone is batter than Kristien Dunst by far.Three things i like about this movie are1)UNTOLD STORY(Even it's not told but it will be in sequels)2)CAST(ANDREW GARFIELD,EMMA STONE,MARTIN SHEEN and others)3)VFX AND FIGHTS(Like Schools fight)I didn't like about this movie is that its little bit like 500 days of summer so you can call this move 500 Days of Spider-man and i think that lizard character played by Rhys Ifans i missed out they didn't sowed this family and his story i hope that they'l do that in the sequel because Lizard is first Spider-man movie villain that didn't die so that's reason why i hope for him in sequelsOver all THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is a brilliant masterpiece and it's one of rare movies worth watching in theater's so buy your tickets and go watch it before it's too late.Good job MARC WEBB ANDREW GARFIELD, EMMA STONE and other. 10/10!P.S Thanks for reading.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing indeed!,"I loved every minute of this reboot, I was one of the few people actually glad Spider-Man was getting a reboot. I was not a big fan of the Sam Raimi movies in the first place and I can honestly say this movie surpasses all 3 of his films.The film was slightly darker which made it all that much more entertaining, I couldn't get enough of the comedic scenes throughout the film and the acting was brilliant. Andrew Garfield showed what it takes to play the role of Peter Parker, to me he felt like he actually was Peter Parker, much better to Tobi Mcguire - Garfield's acting was just superb from start to finish. Not to mention the lovable Emma Stone, I couldn't get enough of her; her acting was also terrific and played the part of Gwen Stacy perfectly.Overall the film was outstandingly amazing and I can't wait to see it. again",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Don't listen to biased reviews. One of 2012's best!,"People are grading it down because it is the origin story again which even if it was too similar you can't down grade it due to that as you review films on their own. Also you can't down grade it because the franchise didn't need rebooted again that doesn't mean you reduce the stars! Is different from the first film and was closer to the comics. I loved the first two (3 was horrible) but this is the best one yet. Andrew Garfield is (pun intended) amazing as Spider-Man and Peter Parker and reflects the character better than Maguire. Emma Stone is Gwen Stacy and she is superior to Dunst. Gwen is his first love unlike MJ and the film shows Peter's intelligence buy having him make web-shooters (which happened in the comics). The characters and their relationships are the best part of this film with Garfield and Stone having the best chemistry than in any other comic book film. The Lizard is brilliant and is the 2nd best Spidey villain after Doc Ock in SM2 but then again they changed his character in that one. The film is a nice mix of light and dark so it's no Dark Knight but it's not like the original films which were more campy. The film is a great modernization as Peter is portrayed as a geeky, smart, outsider instead of a stereotypical nerd (that's why he skateboards) overall this is the truest Spider-Man film and maybe even one of the best comic book films ever!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
'Spider-Man' on the Red Carpet and the Silver Screen,"Marvel Comics' heroes transfer well to the silver screen, but those who think they know Spider-Man from previous incarnations will meet a different Spider-Man/Peter Parker in Columbia Pictures' current release The Amazing Spider-Man. "" it is a completely different film that starts at the beginning of Spider-Man's journey,"" says KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Raven Devanney, age 15, in her review (below). Well, maybe not completely different, as the familiar events set the story in motion. But it is a new villain and a new love interest. And there is plenty of humor. ""In fact, this whole film is filled with comedy and action,"" says Raven.KIDS FIRST! youth film critics were also there at the exciting red carpet event on Saturday. Be sure to check out the KIDS FIRST! website to share their experience on video.The Amazing Spider-Man Reviewed by Raven Devanney (See her full review on video.) http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=wqKg50yEwUMThe Amazing Spider-Man starring Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone definitely lives up to its title because it is truly amazing. I was expecting this film to be an add-on to the most recent Spider-Man series, but it is a completely different film that starts at the beginning of Spider-Man's journey. Of course, Peter Parker (played by Andrew Garfield) is bitten by a genetically modified spider and transforms into Spider-Man, his uncle Ben dies, and that's all the same in the past films about this spandex-sporting hero, but instead of falling for his typical love interest, MJ, Peter falls for Gwen Stacy (played by Emma Stone). And there is no Green Goblin in this film, but instead a new villain for Spider-Man to face.I love this movie! The special effects are phenomenal, especially in 3- D. I love Andrew Garfield in the part of Peter Parker because he does a fantastic job portraying him and he and Emma Stone have such great chemistry, which really shows in their characters. My favorite scene is when Peter is transforming into Spider-Man, because his aunt and uncle have no idea what's wrong with him and it's so funny. In fact, this whole film is filled with comedy and action. My favorite character would have to be Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone because I really admire her and she does a wonderful job playing this role.I think something very different about this film is it seems that the target audience is just teens, whereas in past Spider-Man movies the main audience is teens and adults. Overall, I give The Amazing Spider- Man 5 out of 5 stars because it is amazing and I want to see it over and over again. I can't wait for the sequel to come out.

I like this Spider !!!!!,"I like to ask one thing at the end of every movie. Does this movie make me feel good? Yes, The Amazing Spider-man made me feel very good. It did more. I tried to swing from a pole and climb a wall after seeing this movie. That's how much I liked it.The only concern of many reviewers is that it has been made before and we are made to sit through the similar scenes in this movie too. For them, I tell you this. The first movie was made 10 years and I believe that's enough time to give a remake. This move has as much heart as the first movie had and I love the action scenes in this one.You have to love Garfield's acting and Emma Stone's cuteness. They look very cute together. The spider suite fit him very well too. Overall, I am waiting for The Amazing Spider-man 2!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An excellent interpretation,"I've seen quite a few interpretations of Spiderman, which made me hesitate to watch another mainstream box office interpretation. Luckily, this one not only makes it up for the flawed plots and emotional immaturity in previous Spiderman movies, it beats any movie I have watched in the super hero comic genre at all, ""Batman begins"" included which has been my favorite title of this genre for quite some time. Only Watchmen seems to be a worthy competition, however this title sure surprised me in many ways.I like to see myself as a spiritually mature person, and therefor I find it disgusting to see a movie spoiled with half-baked potatoes, like in Avatar ""You cannot fill a cup, which is already full"", one of the worst mainstream airy fairy quotes ever.With that in mind, this movie will surprise you. The movie-wisdom is serious, deep and very much mature. The emotional plot also seem to follow with mature acting and realistic responses to the dramas projected during the movie spiced up with a comic relief at the right places. The feature plays with a very fine line between being a drama and an action movie, but it does it so well, that I never got bored, so obviously a thorough work of editing has been done here.This makes this box office release the first of its kind to be recommended for the emotionally mature audience without compromising the playful action scenes. I am a fan of both, so I give this movie a 10 out of 10 for creating an outstanding piece of work worth watching over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best One Yet,"Spiderman (Andrew Garfield) gets involved with a version of Animal Control gone bad.This is a reboot from Hollywood. You are welcome America. The reason this is a reboot is because Hollywood knows we cannot remember the previous Spiderman movies and who cares anyway? That said, this is, by far, the best one yet. Why? Inquiring minds want to know.This is the best one yet because it was more on a realistic vein. The previous ones were too campy, had too much humor (oh, the horror) and too many scenes were in daylight. The previous ones were good let's be clear about that. Well, except for Spiderman 3 when Peter Parker wore the black suit. Not good at all.Here the story was more realistic not that we needed it to be, but our main focus is that we are entertained. And, entertained we were. Also, in here we see a good guy Dr. Connors (Rhys Ifans) who changes into a bad guy (okay a lizard, a gigantic one) but with altruistic leanings for the betterment of mankind. How is that possible, you ask? Well, it really isn't, but work with me.As for Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) as Spiderman we see him as dorky at first, then later we forget all about that and are convinced he can do Spiderman. And, we are good with it. End of story. One of the reasons this works is because we see pain inflicted on Peter and in or out of costume, talking with Gwen or his aunt, we see the tortured face and feel that pain. See?Supporting cast with Emma Stone as Gwen, the love interest; Denis Leary as the police chief, Martin Sheen as Peter's uncle and Sally Field as Peter's aunt were all very good.There were not enough scenes to really tell if the chemistry between Peter Parker and Gwen was good enough. Hey, this is a reboot and the feeling each other out took too long. Let's say the chemistry was almost there. Happy now? We'll see more chemistry in the sequels. Count on it.And, the main plot of the story is animal control gone bad and was easy enough for us to understand. Hey, we go to Spiderman movies to see the CGI and it was nothing short of fantastic. Remember when we saw Superman, the movie (that would be the first one) and we were told we would really believe a man can fly? Well, in here we needed to see Spiderman swinging all over the place and swing all over the place he did. What more can anyone ask? (well, maybe the 3-D Version).All in all very entertaining and Inquiring Minds are now satisfied, resting and waiting for the next one.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is how you reboot a franchise!,"I remember walking out of the earlier Spiderman movies so many years ago, in awe of the special effects, the writing, the cheeky humor. Surely, it would be difficult to displace those great memories. So, I went into The Amazing Spiderman with an open mind. I had to believe that Sony had seen more in the director than just the pun in his name.The Plot: Peter knows little about his missing parents, but stumbling upon their old belongings he finds links that may help him gain some answers. Along the way, he gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider (Yes, no radiation) & goes through amazing comic sequences coming to grips with his new found powers. He even fashions his own web shooters to complete the spider arsenal (They've stuck to the comics & gotten rid of the irritating oh-so-conveniently-placed genetic web shooters we found with Raimi's movies). Along the way, he meets a girl, falls in love, only to discover her dad (Leary) is the Captain of the police force, the very man responsible for nabbing his vigilante alter-ego. Parker is trying to assist his parents' colleague Dr.Connors perfect inter-species gene transfers allowing the doc to eventually regrow an amputated arm. Miracle cures however, do not come without side effects...Webb takes the more classical comic book & TV show route into what Spiderman really is, a kid with superpowers coming to grips with reality. On that front, Andrew Garfield is a delight. He's got depth to his acting (go watch the social network if you haven't); he handles all the jokes & sorrow with equal aplomb. I'm extremely glad they redid the ""Epiphany"" scene from the initial movies so differently. Garfield's got the potential to take this Spidey places where Tobey just couldn't. Gone is the calm, ever-tolerant, almost Gandhian, clumsy Peter Parker. He now has the option to grow into a more multi-dimensional character, like in the comics. This was clearly impossible in the original movies, we all know know how miserably they failed in the third movie trying to show a different side to Parker.Sheen & Field are perfectly cast as Uncle Ben & Aunt May. Sheen especially shows a frailty to Ben's character not earlier seen, a man who's trying hard & sometimes fails with a child he loves as his own but can't outright claim him to be. Who'd have through that Rhys Ifans, who's done great over-the-top characters in the past, would play Dr.Connor with such subtlety? Emma Stone is reduced to being a pretty face who isn't given much screen time to showcase her prowess, but she's still an important catalyst in the movie to bring out the crazed hormone driven teenager that Parker really is.I recently watched the first and second Spiderman movies. Somehow there were flaws that I hadn't noticed earlier. Tobey's acting skills, an ill- paced screenplay, hammy dialogue, stupid plot-lines with Harry Osborn & the super cheesy sequences that made you feel that New York should've been given its own vanity card. I still love them & they're superbly entertaining, but a lot of reviewers have been wrongly placing these movies up on a pedestal & drawing unfair comparisons with the current film. Those movies set the tone for the next decade of Superhero movies, they weren't without flaws.The Amazing Spiderman is definitely a movie that has its own share of merits: a superb cast that you cannot fault, a well driven screenplay, the amazing spidey's eye view sequences, the scenes in the subway, alley & the warehouse. Where it fails is drawing in the audience, & feeling emotionally attached to Peter Parker. The movie could've also done without some cheesy & corny sequences that are in direct reference to the older movies. I was almost hoping that they'd pick up the original dialogue at the end, ""Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: With great power comes great responsibility. This is my gift, my curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-man"" Wishful thinking? Maybe next time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Amazing Spider-Man,"At first i was shocked by all the bad reviews this movie got. Story, cast, difference from the first Spider Man movie etc etc.. To be honest i think most of the critics are still hung up in the old trilogy, but to be fair i didn't get to excited when i heard they were making a new series of the Spider Man. So as you might notice its 2017 when i enter this review. But i thought a boring Tuesday wouldn't get destroyed if this movie was as bad as most of the reviews i read pre-hand.So the shocker! I loved it!For me the cast, the story and the atmosphere this movie gave me was pure awesome. Off course i loved the first movie but this is for me a new and improved one that didn't just copy the same story as many other remakes does. This was a new and more exciting movie. It gave me a more tougher, darker side of Spider-Man vs the original Spider Man movie. And i must say Andrew Garfield really impressed me as an actor and gave Spider Man a more complete role instead of being a nerdy boy with bad humor.So if you wonder if you should see this or not, at least give it a chance.

"Finally, the movie Spidey deserved","I saw the Tobey Maguire trilogy, and I liked it, those movies were significant in my childhood, then I began to read the comic-books and I liked Spider-man even more, it was my obsession, and I realized that the movies were so different than the original story.Now, this brand-new movie comes out and I feel good with the result, everything is better! The cast, of course, is more accurate to the idea of the original Spidey, while in the other movies Sam Raimi used mature actors, a big mistake, Peter is a teenager! Point to TASM. The story in this movie was not perfect, but I liked it. Acting was great! All of the actors got into their characters so well. Visual effects were awesome, beautiful, well-done. And finally something that cannot miss in any spider-man story, the humor, in The Amazing Spider-man the humor goes by funny and smart quotes and situations, while in the previous movies the humor was a little bit ridiculous.Finally all I can say is, now I'm older, and after watching the four movies, my thumb-up goes to this one, a true success.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Red, Blue and the 4th","We first saw Peter Parker, the kid who became the iconic hero of all time, back in 2002 when Tobey Maguire made him famous – but this goes all the way back, not just in yesteryear but during the comic book days. In 1963, The Amazing Spider Man hit the bookstores and comic strips, but now a days, we all need a hero.Peter Parker, (played by new-comer Andrew Garfield) was a troubled young man from the beginning, his parents leaving him behind with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May (played brilliantly by the greatest actor and actress of our time Martin Sheen and Sally Field). During his adolescence, Peter was faced with bullies and the occasional spider bite. But it was not your usual spider bite, a radioactive spider with mutations beyond our capability.But when things get a little green, Dr. Curt Conners (played by Rhys Ifans, who brought us Xenophilius Lovegood in Harry Potter 7 Part 1), all he ever wanted was to make the human race understand the importance of being treated like reptiles – lizards to say the least.What an incredible timing to bring this movie before the independence of our country. What an incredible movie that Mark Webb brought us. I know Sam Raimi would be very proud, but Mark you, my friend out-done Sam in every way. The cast was brilliant, the story was awesome, the effects perfection.If I was Spider Man, the one thing that I would love to do – the web slinging. I would like to fly like Spider Man so that I can save everyone and be the hero of the Red and Blue.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly good!,"I didn't think I'd like this. But I ended up loving it! All the actors/actresses in this film were so good, so believable! There was something really believable about the new Peter Parker, Andrew Garfield. He acted like a true awkward (and raw) teen! Also, when I watched the Captain America film, my girlfriend complained how unrealistic it was that Cap adapted to his new body immediately. Whereas in this new Spider-man film, Peter Parker was ripping out bathroom taps (US: faucets) by accident, and shattering glass whenever he shut the door hard (again, accidentally). It took him time to master his speed and coordination too. It was really, really good - really believable. My friend - a long-time Marvel fan - told me that this Peter Parker was more like the one from the comics, a true wise-cracker. I never intended to watch this film, but am so glad that I did! This is a true Spider-man film! (Though I preferred the villains in the Tobey Maguire films - the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus. The current film is like a more serious version of the Maguire films.)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nowhere near as good as the original Spider-man!!!,"I cannot believe people actually like/enjoy this movie. The story was bad, the acting was bad, and don't even get me started on the costume. The old costume in the other films looked way better than this one, in this one it looks cheep, skinny and weak. From start to finish it was horrible, too long and boring. The worse part was there wasn't enough/ did not deliver enough action. I bet you Tobey McGuire and the whole cast of the original spider-man is somewhere laughing at how this film was so awful. It tried to be like the first film of spider-man but failed. If you asked me, I would tell you to avoid this film and just wait until it comes to DVD. Final rating 1/10.

Painfully underrated,"When I saw this movie back in 2012 I was blown away by Andrew Garfield's performance. I wasn't so sure I'd like it because I was so in love with Tobey's performance in the 3 Raimi films, but I was so wrong. Not only is Garfield my favorite Spider-Man/Peter Parker, but this movie as a whole is just a masterpiece from the beginning to end. Andrew Garfield captures the sheer wittiness that Spider-Man has so well. Something that the Raimi films was lacking in.

The Spider-Man trilogy was a disappointment to me, so I was hesitant to even watch this one, but I am glad I did.

The actors and actresses were a success to there related characters as well.If you even remotely enjoyed the previous three Spider-Man films you will most certainly enjoy this one as well, because it was done in better taste, was very well scripted, and the cast was better selected.

"""Amazing Spiderman"" Review","It's hard to approach this movie on its own merits; it's only been ten years since Sam Raimi's first ""Spiderman"" film, and only five years since his series was rounded off in ""Spiderman 3."" With these films still fresh in the consciousness, one can't help but to approach this reboot with the forethought that it's completely frivolous and unnecessary, especially since it covers some of the same ground as the first original ""Spiderman"" film. Chances are that your decision to see and enjoy this film will be entirely biased based on your views on this, and your opinion on the other Spidey films. Hated Tobey McGuire and Sam Raimi's cartoonish style? Then perhaps this reboot will satisfy you better. Otherwise, you might really will think it's unnecessary.If you can push your memory of the other films out of your head, ""The Amazing Spiderman"" is a perfectly serviceable blockbuster. It has its share of action and special effects, especially toward the end with the climactic duel between Spiderman and the villain. There are some fun heroics in the middle of the film. Even when Spidey isn't kicking butt and taking names, the movie's comedy is successfully funny and the melodrama/romance is not too overbearing. If anything, I felt this movie's drama was more entertaining than in the other ""Spiderman"" films, thanks largely to the film's style and acting, but I'm sure other viewers may disagree. The pacing is admittedly not perfect; some parts whiz by and skim over some plot points, while other parts take their time. The best that can be said is that the film rarely drags.The story is familiar territory, albeit told differently. It may irk some viewers to have to sit through Peter Parker's drama all over again; I also found it a little disconcerting that many details have been withheld, presumably to be revealed in a sequel. Still, the film does a fine job of telling the origin story, detailing the main character's transformation into a superhero, and establishing all the characters and their relationships. In fact, character development is where the film excels: Peter Parker (and in turn Spiderman himself) is a far stronger character, showing a broad range of emotions. It is a blast to watch his wisecracks and his attitude, but he does show a perfectly serious demeanor when necessary.Filmed with solid, quality photography, the film looks stylish, without being cartoony like Sam Raimi's films. The editing is good most of the time, with only a few parts that appeared choppy. Acting is pleasing; Andrew Garfield is impeccable as Peter Parker, Emma Stone makes for a perfectly likable love interest, and Rhys Ifans does his best with the villain. The writing is pretty decent. This film features plenty of good-looking sets, props, and costumes. There are some special effects that don't look that good, but most hold up. Music is pretty decent.Ultimately, I felt it was a good film, and I really can't say whether I prefer this one or Sam Raimi's films better. As it is, I like them all pretty equally. As for recommending ""The Amazing Spiderman"" to anybody else, I would only recommend a rental, because your enjoyment will depend on many variables.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Good)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Overall a great film, that has been performed fantastically.","First of all can I say I'm only 14. this is a teenage view on this film. Also I haven't had much experience on writing reviews so bare with me. Some people may think this is an necessary addition to the already bulging collection of superhero films; The Avengers, Iron man, Captain America, Thor (dare I go on. But this film adds a new level to the superhero genre that I think will be hard to beat. This is the story of a young man called Peter........ you know the story, you've heard it before and watched the original trilogy of films. The thing that makes this film differ to the original story is the focus on Peter's father, who seems to have been white washed out of the original. Peter wants to find out about him and try to understand why he left him. Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Parker out trumps Tobey Maguire's, as Garfield adds one extra thing. Emotion. Throughout his search for truth, Parker has some rough times and emotions are flying! His way of putting across his feelings are outstanding!overall I thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation of an already amazing story. I wasn't too sure on it before going, due to the fact I wasn't the biggest fan of The Avenger, however from start to end I was hooked. I recommend this film to any 90's kids who grew up with the originals, any kids who are too young to remember the originals, and of course any adults who never knew when to grow up fully.(Keep an eye out for Stan Lee's cameo as with all Marvel films)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Underrated watch - Garfield doesn't get the credit he deserves,"I love this film and it seemed to garner a backlash against it that I never understood.

Emma Stone was great, Sally Field and Martin Sheen were their usual brilliant selves and anything with Denis Leary in is a much watch as far as I am concerned. Great action set pieces (particularly in the sewer - generated a real sense of danger and tension).All in all, my favourite Spider-Man (I like Ton Holland abs he's probably a better fit for the MCU but Andrew is a great standalone Spidey.He should have got a third film!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best Comicbook Movie of the year,"This is truly an amazing movie-better than The Avengers and the TDKR. Has a great pacing and the story line is very deep also.Andrew Garfield owns the role of Peter Parker.All the others do good too especially Ifans and Stone.TASM is a gem in the sense that it brings forward the story of the real Peter Parker in it;s very true sense-the desperation;the felling of awe and subsequent mystery.Toby M.was a good Spider Man but unlike Garfield,could not convey the right emotions of the character.The only problem with the story is that is that it plays too close to the Origin angle which is quite unnecessary.The whole of the movie makes you feel that Director Marc Webb is setting up the stage for a powerful universe and series in the future.Also the comedy and humor is well balanced,not enveloping the dire seriousness of the story.The action scenes are few but they are well-crafted and original.The really bring out the speed and agility of the character that is Spider-Man.The focus on the origin does not shift till the very end and it shows Peter leaning about his great powers throughout the movie.AMAZING!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
We all have secrets: the ones we keep... and the ones that are kept from us.,"You always open yourself up to criticism when you attempt a review of movies spawned from comics.The purists will jump at any chance to criticize any deviation. Not having a background in the comics, I opine only about the movies themselves.I love spider-man. My favorite is Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2, with the best of the series' villains, Doc Ock. I am going to go out on a limb and say this is the second best.It was very realistic, in my opinion, from the typical adolescent hi- jinks by Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) in the beginning, to a real attraction with Gwen (Emma Stone), to the realization of his mission in life as outlined by his uncle Ben, played brilliantly by Martin Sheen.Denis Leary was great, and Rhys Ifans has come a long way from Spike.Curious to know how long he will be able to stay away from Gwen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best Spiderman Movie Yet,"This is a great movie that tells a more modernized, less strung out, version of the Spiderman story with a few twists from the original comic books.I think they did an awesome job at making the Peter Parker character more ""real"" while giving him that more sarcastic feel that you may have remembered from the comic books. Being traumatized by the awful Spiderman movies that came out in the early to mid 2000s, I was almost afraid to watch this movie in fear of what they may have done to the whole idea of Spiderman, but I am glad I watched it.Not too over dramatized and not too modified, which is what you found in the previous films. The story isn't exactly like the comic book for a few reasons, one of them being the fact that they would drag the story out too much and cause it to be boring as we seen in the last attempt. So if you are one of those people who think that everything should remain unscathed in the comic book story-line then this probably isn't for you, otherwise, I would definitely recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A Great Summer Flick, A Worthy Spider-Man Story","Other people have said it more eloquently than I ever possibly can, so I will leave short and simple: this is a great movie. It takes the story that we all know and love and places it in a real New York, with real people whose lives have real emotions and real consequences. It does not cater to any specific age group, but pumps the story with family-friendly nods to all. There is the perfect blend of humor and drama, and every character is given a strong backbone for their personalities and developments.My only issue with the movie was a lack of a prominent character of color. While we saw a New York rich with people of different races, there were only two characters of racial minority given lines, and one was used as a gag. It would have been nice to have Peter interact with more racially diverse people.I highly recommend this movie to everyone, though. It has some flaws, but it is an agreeable movie with most crowds, and is just generally entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This film is anything but amazing!,"""The Amazing Spider-Man"" (2012), why does this ""movie"" exist? No really, why did they make this ""film""? This is yet another worthless and pathetic excuse for a cash-grab. Seriously, the only reason that they made this ""movie"" was to put money in their pockets. Now, I could be wrong about that, but I would be very surprised if I was. This ""film"", just like most other movie reboots/remakes, is entirely pointless. It's easily one of the top ten worst reboots/remakes that I have ever seen. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" has a predictable and boring storyline, standard to terrible acting, and a generic cliched soundtrack to attempt to tie this diarrhea stain together. The plot is, a teenager gets bitten by a genetically-enhanced super spider and becomes the superhero Spider-Man. Yes, it follows the exact same storyline as ""Spider-Man"" (2002), but with slight alterations. If you've seen the 2002 movie, then you've seen this pile of filth. It's like they took the script from the 2002 film, copied and pasted it, then just made some slight changes to try and make it a different movie. Which of course, they failed miserably! The biggest differences are: Spider-Man doesn't fight the Green Goblin in this ""film"", he fights Lizard instead. Also, his girlfriend is not Mary Jane this time, it's Gwen Stacy. Other than those two changes, it's exactly the same premise as the 2002 film. It's 136 minutes in length, but it feels like an eternity. Why? Because, it's dull and boring! For the most part, next to nothing of substance happens. As for the acting, it's just as terrible as the story. The majority of the cast does an abysmal job with their performances here. Especially Andrew Garfield! The sad thing is, he plays Peter Parker/Spider-Man himself, the main character. What a huge casting mistake that was. Andrew Garfield is one of the worst actors of all-time, and his performance, or lack thereof, is no different here. Every time he's on the screen, let alone when he speaks, I cringe. Even when his mask is on, the annoyance still shines through! Most of the acting from the rest of the cast suffers because of him. The only ones who appear to be trying, are: Emma Stone, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen and Sally Field. Everyone else does horribly with their acting! One thing I need to point out, is the casting of Sally Field as May Parker. Just hear me out, she did a decent job with her performance here. The only problem, is that she looks way too young to play that character! May Parker in the comic books is supposed to be older woman with gray hair. Did no one in the casting session pick up on that? Or, just look for a picture from the comics? Talk about lazy casting, what an embarrassment! As far as the soundtrack by James Horner goes, it's about as generic as you can get. Granted, it does have it's moments here and there. But overall, his film score adds nothing to this ""movie""! That's a shock, because James Horner has written many great film scores. What happened to him here? Any way, let's get to the only two good elements in this piece of garbage. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. You can't go wrong with filming your movie in New York City! As far as the special effects go, they are well-done and still hold up today. They do get a bit cheesy at times, but I still give them a pass. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is one of the most pointless reboot movies in the history of cinema. Whenever I think about it, I shudder with sheer disgust. I'm struggling to give this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Do I have to tell you to stay away from this ""movie""? I think that's more than obvious enough. Just stick with the original ""Spider-Man"" trilogy with the one, and only, Tobey Maguire. Not only are those three films the best ""Spider-Man"" movies, it just so happens to be one of my top ten favorite trilogies of all-time. Any way, those are the real ""Spider-Man"" films! All of the other ones suck, big-time. If, for some reason, you feel the need to subject yourself to ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", you won't be cheering: ""go web, go!"" Instead, you'll be shouting: ""go movie, go!"" You'll just be sitting there, waiting for it to end. What a pile of trash it is!",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Kills the Spiderman Legend,"I'm not sure what everyone else was watching but for me the new Spiderman movie was a painful experience, reminded me of the Superman remake 'Superman Returns'. To start with the acting and script was very poor and the movie was over two hours long. This movie gives you a weak feeble Spiderman whose only real ability is climbing and jumping. The story gives you the beginning of Spiderman, how peter is bitten and changes to the superhero. Only thing is, Andrew Garfield is such a weasel, physically he is not very convincing as Spiderman and this is comparing to Toby Maguire. Andrew Garfield looks like a child dressed in a very poor Spiderman costume. For me this movie single handily killed the Spiderman legend which I grew up with as a child. The villain which is a giant lizard is a joke. Reese Ifan's acting is terrible. My advice is stay away from this one, it's all hype by the critics and the truth will come out in a few weeks. Please please don't make anymore Spiderman movies.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent,"Reading through some reviews I don't think all the negative reviewers actually watched the film, or must have gone in to watch it in a bad mood which ruined their experience & are blaming it on the film. I am a theater manager and got the opportunity to watch this the night before its midnight premiere & I loved it even more so then the original SAM rami version, my son and wife also thought it was excellent, so ignore all the hate and judge for yourself, my guess is it will not disappoint. I would not go as far as saying that its as good as Avengers but to even consider that thought even just for a second is a compliment to this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Solid special effects,"OK so spider man 1 was such an amazing solid movie with good script and effects. Spider man 2 was so solid in effects and story line. I love the bit when the bully in the canteen try to fight him, peter parker the geek in glasses beats him up that was so kool and touching it makes you feel like fighting back in any situation. Spider man 3 what can i say he fights a black baddie spider man which also has some really decent fight scenes so far so good. Then amazing spider man i gotta say i liked the spider man 2 peter parker he actually looked good in that role, but peter parker in spider man 3 was still very effective with some really nice touches to the movie and i like the fight scenes against the bad guy lizard monster the effects were really good so over all just watch this amazing movie just like you watch the other spider man movies because you will enjoy this if you love super heroes dreams can come true LOL thanks",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""A Marvelous Spider-Man""","Marc Webb's ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a well rounded film that captures everything you'd expect from a Marvel story line and a Spider- Man film as well. It had everything you want from a Marvel film including: romance, comedy, action, and fun. Some reviewers have criticized this films over-use of the romance element, but I personally enjoyed this aspect.We must not forget that Spider-Man is in high school and romance is undoubtedly a pivotal part in the mask vigilante's comic book presence as well. Most importantly this movie is FUN and I never found myself bored at any point. In fact some of the scenes are so visually phenomenal that you are left in shear amazement. For a two-hour long film, it feels slightly rushed but that's what adds to the constant excitement.The actors were phenomenal in almost every area. Andrew Garfield completely embodies the Peter Parker/Spider-Man persona perfectly. I can't say that I was shocked because he really took this role as an honor and was very dedicated to embracing the character. Emma Stone is equally as great in her role as Gwen Stacy and you will not be disappointed. Generally I'm not huge on Emma Stone, but I absolutely adored and bought into her character throughout the duration of this film. The only character I was slightly turned off of was Sally Field as Aunt May. She wasn't necessarily bad, there was just something about Sally Field's portrayal of Aunt May that was slightly unsatisfying. Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard was an excellent selection and you'll find that he is a viable good guy and bad guy simultaneously. His story line isn't really explored enough for my taste, but that's a matter of my personal opinion.Ultimately, I noticed that if you go into this film trying to compare it to the 2002 series you're going to be overly critical of ""The Amazing Spider-Man."" That being said, in comparison to the old series I felt this one was far more visually pleasing and the overall tone of the film was much more gripping. Andrew Garfield exceeds Tobey Maguire as the masked superhero and he portrays the character better in almost every way. This movie may seem rushed or overly fast-paced for some because Marc Webb didn't want to over-state plot-points that had already been used in the previous trilogy.Don't allow others to manipulate your view of the movie before you enter the film. If you go in with an open mind and are prepared to have a good time, I guarantee you will not be disappointed!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
New and improved Spidey,"When I initially heard about this reboot, I was skeptical. Why make them again so soon? When I was little, the Spider-Man movies came out and those were the first superhero movies I ever watched. I loved them. However, as I got older, I realized that much of what makes up those movies was quite cheesy, particularly Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker. But this is not a review of those. I am reviewing the new and improved ""amazing"" Spider-Man. And I am pleased to say that it was surprisingly well done and very worthwhile. What was really missing from the previous installments was that level of darkness and threat that is present here. This film offers a dark, fresh new take on the traditional Spider-Man that I think you will enjoy. The characters are more engaging and more developed. I don't have much to say about this is terms of complaints. It is a refreshing, enjoyable piece of entertainment. Also, in all of Stan Lee's cameo appearance, I think this one is my favorite.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
they ruined it,"first half get over and u feel like u r watching twilight. its all cushy love story. nothing happens. its very bland. then in the second half we eagerly wait for something but nope. this is pathetic movie especially coming after the spiderman 3. there's so much stuff happening in spiderman 3 but here, its a drama. spiderman is not about iron man like comedy. its is darker. the hero doesn't match the image of spiderman. hes to cool. not the geeky kind hes supposed to be. and the whole movie is about their love story which u will never know how started. the spiderman is not discreet, not the professional kind we are used to. he takes off his mask for just anybody. this is nothing like the previous movies. the process of how he becomes spiderman was way more beautifully shown in the original series. there's just a single villain whos too easy to defeat. no real edge of the seat experience, no urgency. and ya 3d effects - patchy, not in whole movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing is correct.,"I literally just came back from seeing this and suffice it to say I enjoyed it immensely.OK, first of all, Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker is amazing. In my opinion he owns the role in the same way Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark and Christian Bale is Batman. And in terms of quality as far as reboots go this is up there with Batman Begins and Casino Royale.The pacing is methodical, a considerable amount of time (about the first half of the movie) is spent on character building and introducing us to the relationships and the people in Peter Parker's life. If you can stomach origin stories, you will love it.The story arc is bound to seem familiar but the focus of it is on Peter Parker, akin to Batman Begins for Bruce Wayne. It works wonderfully and makes for a much more emotional movie. Oh yes, if there is anything this particular Spidey has more than its predecessor, it's heart.A must-see for comic book fans,10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This movie is a disappointment,"My brother went to see The Amazing Spiderman 3d and gave me this feedback, which seemed too good not to share as a review. We love movies and are generally speaking quite a ""good audience"".The Amazing Spiderman is a terrible movie. Opening scene gets award for most clichés in first minute. 75% of the story is déjà vu, but with a clumsy script seemingly written by an 8 year old. The bad guy has the worst plan ever for domination, AND recants in the end. The only two good actors in the movie get killed, probably after seeing how badly the script plays out. Stay on the previous Spiderman impressions, and do not watch this one if you can avoid it.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bitten by the Amazing Spidey,"I am never a fan of Spidey and always skeptical when Sam Raimi's movies came out, and this one was no exception at first, but oh boy.....how this one proved me wrong.From the moment, the teaser was released, I was already intrigued and when the official trailer and longer trailer were released, I knew it would be a good one and a better one, for sure.I still recalled how the negative comments was when news broke out that Andrew Garfield, a Brit and relatively quite unknown to public aside from The Social Network movie, being selected.Lo and behold,in my opinion, Andrew Garfield gave us the perfect Spidey so far. He portrayed Spidey as how I recalled reading the comics and watching the animated movies.His body language was superb, even when he was in costume, you could tell that Spidey was just another teenager. Salute to this young Brits. Not sure if it only me, but I felt the Brits lately are on the rise, not only in State but worldwide.Emma Stone was adorable as always, her chemistry with Andrew was excellent, no wonder they are a pair now.Rhys Ifans played Dr Connors aka the Lizard in such convincing act, another good casting.Marc Webb is superb as the new Director, everything was made to perfection. The pace, the acting, the details and the angles when he shot the scene, definitely 2 thumbs up!And in all Marvel movies, especially Stan Lee's creations, I am always on the lookout for Stan cameo. No exception for this one, if usually you blink and miss kind of thing in spotting Stan in other movie, this time, Do Open Your Eyes, people! It is the best cameo by Stan so far, in my opinion. Seeing Stan is like reminding me how great he is, his creativity is beyond description.The movie pace was excellent, I thought it was a bit too fast in beginning but as it moved on, I found it did made sense. The casts were excellent, the script was credible, the action sequences would definitely pleased the viewers.I couldn't find any fault in this movie, i just felt it went back to the root of Spidey comic. And perhaps what impressed me more, how the script made the characters here smarter, especially for Gwen Stacy's character, not a screaming gal like in other Sam's movie.Definitely A Must See Movie!!!PS: After Watching Spidey, I am wondering whether Justice League movie would ever being made. Perhaps after the new Superman and Wonder Woman movies? Couldn't imagine the pressure on the Director if there is one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Waaaay better than the previous installments... and I mean ANY of them!,"The Good: This movie is one of the rare superhero flicks with a heart. At the same time it possesses some of the best CGI and action sequences. The 3D surely does enrich the visual appeal of the movie, especially in the action sequences.Andrew Garfield is simply terrific as Peter Parker and no spider-man fan will be disappointed with his portrayal of the wise-cracking yet troubled teenager. (Even though some say that his sense of humor borders on arrogance.) His portrayal of Peter Parker is so amazing that it will surely set a benchmark for all the future Peter Parkers to come. Emma Stone is simply lovely as Gwen Stacy. Her character has been fleshed out neatly by the writers and her acting is way better than Kirsten Dunst's MJ. Special mention to Rhys Ifans as well. His portrayal of the Lizard is simply awesome. I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised by how the Lizard looks and how its mannerisms have been captured.The camera work is also stupendous and the direction is fabulous. The action set pieces will surely blow your mind away. This is equally true for romantic/emotional scenes as well (This, of course, is no shocker given that Marc Webb had earlier directed ""500 Days of Summer"").The Bad: MANY of the scenes and dialogs depicted in the trailers were completely absent from the final cut (or at least the one released in India). This was really very irritating. Irrfan Khan's Dr. Ratha had a blink and a miss role. Not exactly ""the untold story"" as these elements of the story kind of remain underdeveloped. (Perhaps this issue will get resolved in the coming installments).What some critiques are saying and my take on it:1. ""Origins story not required"" -- Really? I can see another Spider-man origins story if it brings something fresh to the table. And this movie does more than what is required to infuse a sense of originality the previous one.2. ""Too much deja vu"" -- For crying out loud, it IS an origins story. It's basic ingredients cannot change all of a sudden. For then people would have accused it of not remaining true to the comics.3. ""CGI not up to the mark and 3D is useless"": I had no such issues. And trust me I had gone with great expectations... and as it turns out all those expectations were met. And not watching the movie is like reducing the fun by half.4. ""Twilight for the superhero generation"": Spiderman is NO Superman. Fortunately or unfortunately, he is a teenager and he has Twilight-ish issues in his life. That is in fact one of the reasons why he is so loved all over the world. I don't see any reason to crib if the same is depicted in the movie at the cost of mindless action scenes.5. ""Story not up to the mark"": Kind of agree with this one. But the 'Goods' totally make up for this one flaw. (And I agree it is not a minor one... but then I am a crazy Spidey fan!) Do watch this one. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The pointless Spiderman,I watched this movie when it premiered and here is what I think of it: Pointless It has story lines which that don't go anywhere which leaves you with a feeling of why I bothered to see this movie.The Gwen Stacey storyline is progressing to something serious but then nothing happens.The Peter Parker parents mystery is progressing to get the truth but then nothing happens.Only other smaller less meaningful stories get completion but they were boring and not important.This movie is a disappointment and weak.,5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Well made origin story, delight for comic book fans","With that said, as the name says Amazing movie! Way better than the last trilogy, though I'd say Spiderman 2 is still the best and Sam Raimi the better director, this one stands out on its own and serves as a much better and ""true"" origin story. Some parts even feels similar to the way to Batman Begins, but could have been better but great nonetheless.Very good and personal plot, good acting by the cast, Andrew Garfield was amazing, no over exaggeration in the movies you see these days and basic stunts and action sequences done very well then throwing in hopeless complex sequences just to make it look good.More of a ""teen-flick"" as this is the first movie I've seen where the girl is beautiful yet clothed all the time and dry and the guy is stripped at a point :P (which makes it enjoyable for females and probably a good movie date?) but not to be mistaken as some action- romantic film as some of the trailers might suggest, this is actually a very good super hero movie, having good moments and having a good balance between comic, dark and realistic.I'd give this a vote above The Avengers on this years best movies.

Universal Truth - NO Spoilers!,"In the words of Arthur Fonzarelli (aka The Fonz), ""bull... makes the world go round"". This latest installment of Spidey and the critics' and the public's reaction are all testament to how true that is. Perfect proof that corporations are greedy (why a remake? why now and why so poorly done?), critics are stupid (really Roger Ebert? because the origin story takes up an hour of screen time it is somehow ""better""? you are crazy!) and the public will believe hype and has a very short term memory (really, this one has more humor or the action scenes were better than the first installments? No way in Heck!). This is a entertaining movie...I'll give it that. The origin story has a few nice new pieces to it. The bad guy is somewhat interesting. The actress playing Gwen is outstanding. Yes, all true. But while the Toby McGuire installments may not have been perfect, they had great drama, great buildup of origin story in 1st installment, the depth of the characters and the inner-turmoil they all felt was very real, and they did it while making you feel it was all believable. After watching this at no time did I ever have an emotional attachment to Spidey, I never worried that he wouldn't survive the fight scenes, and poor Sally Field and Martin Sheen just over act themselves out of such a small role. All this is testament to how well done those Toby McGuire movies were (admittedly the 3rd movie was very poor on many levels but it still had humor and depth of characters). This version is more Nickelodeon or MTV after school special. Interesting enough to watch but they scaled down the good stuff to focus on high-school romance and drama and the whole concept suffers. If you find yourself enjoying this, don't be fooled by our society's epidemic of short attention span an lack of memory for important things from the past...go back and revisit Spiderman 1 and 2 and see what a REAL comic book superhero movie could be.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Don't listen to the naysayers, this is a very good film !","Lets get things straight. This was a film that was about the character of Peter Parker. Yes, we did have the Lizard as the main villain but this was not about that character.Andrew Garfield was excellent. He brings a new dimension to the character of Peter and I was astounded by the way he made Peter feel like a real person. He has problems that he learns to iron out during the film and that makes the character extremely relatable. Tobey was great but Andrew Garfield owned this role in my opinion.The rest of the cast were great too. I loved the rooftop sequence between Gwen and Peter. It had a really beautiful moment in it and I really felt the characters emotions during that scene.The cinematography is delicious. It has a very artistic flare to it and it made it feel like it had come from the pages of the comic book at times.The score worked really well in this movie for me as well. It has more of a classical approach to it and I thought it complimented the film with a tremendous amount of spirit. There is a particular moment when Spidey has been captured by the police, that really pushes the score to the next level. In a weird way it kind of reminded me of the Superman theme.The action I found to be refreshingly clear and exciting. The CGI was great all in all with the occasional hokey areas. I let this off though because some of the action sequences were creatively realised. Loved the school fight particularly. Great use of Spidey's abilities in that sequence.The only flaws I could see were definitely Connors character development and Ratha's role being rather minute. I wonder whether there will be a director's cut? Also the pacing was a bit fast at times. Though to be fair they had a lot to go over in this movie. I think when the sequel is released it will have a much more consistent pace to it and have some time to develop the next main villain properly.All in all this film gets a 9/10 from me and it is now personally my favourite Spider-Man and Marvel film. I preferred this over The Avengers and some of my friends who went to see it with me felt exactly the same way. I now look forward to the sequel and I believe if they can develop the characters even further and push the boundaries, we could have something unbelievably special.Also just for the people who have not seen this yet. Pay no attention to the negative reviews, that attack it because it contains the origin again. This feels nothing like the original Raimi origin and should be appreciated as it's own entity. Yes we have the basics but that is not Raimi's origin, it's the source materials. Spider-Man is back and he is better than ever !",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Amazing Movie (Though, I'm tired of the pun too!)","This was easily my most anticipated movie of the year. Spider-Man being my favorite character in any form of media, and reading just about any and every Spider-Man story I can get my hands on, you can trust me when I say this is easily the best Spider-Man movie to date. Now, I don't know if as a movie it tops spider-Man 2. I'll have to see it again, but I can assure you that that characters are a lot closer to their comic counterpart and the action scenes and ideas brought up are exactly what you would want in a Spider-Man movie. The acting as a whole was great, but I want to focus on Emma Stone and, of course, Andrew Garfield. This is the first time I've legit cared about a romance in a superhero movie. Usually, they feel to tacked on, or just kind of there, but here fell in love with both characters (....no h**o). Their scenes together were the best parts of the movie for me, especially the scene on Peter's porch near the end that I won't spoil. Now, Andrew. I felt with him exactly what I felt with RDJ playing tony Stark in Iron Man. The same kind of magic, as if he were born to play the role, and I know this is just my opinion (as is the whole review) but I'm going to say that this is the best performance in a comic book movie since Heath Ledger as The Joker in The Dark Knight. He truly was fantastic as both Peter and Spider-Man. The only complaints I have are that the Lizard is a HUGE missed opportunity, where they could've told a kind of Jekyll/Hyde story and show some humanity in the character, he just kind of turns into ""Generic Villain A"", though the fight scenes are cool. Second, and final complaint is the movie is very obviously cut up at points. It's kind of distracting at first, but overall if you love spider-Man or you've never read a comic book in your life and are just looking for a fun time, go see this movie. In fact see it twice. It truly is Amazing...sorry...no really I am...I'll stop now.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The story had a lot with this one, but I hadn't been this emotionally invested into characters since.... well, I don't know when. For a comic book movie, the performances were powerful this time around. For once, we have a Peter Parker that really felt like a Peter Parker. Tobey Maguire was okay, but Andrew Garfield just nailed it. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey, well, I just don't know who could play that part better. The real show stealer is Denis Leary as Gwen's dad. But then again, I love Denis Leary anyway.The story is almost essentially the same as the first Sam Raimi Spiderman movie but just replace Hob Goblin with The Lizard and, well, okay, there are a few differences here and there but the way the story was handled, it felt fresh. It felt more human this time around, almost darker. The film even took some chances like how Spiderman goes into the sewer and makes this web concoction thing and just waits. While I'm at it, I really like the touches with the lizards foreshadowing that Lizard is around and the spider that follows Peter.If there are some things I didn't like about The Amazing Spiderman that would be the fact that whenever Lizard talks, he's less menacing. He also looks like one of the Goomba characters from that Super Mario Bros movie. Also, why would Peter Parker plant stuff around with his name on it? For a genius, that's pretty stupid.But besides that, this is a great movie! It's a comic book movie with emotion and solid performances. It may even beat out The Avengers. That's a tough call since Robert Downey Jr. is awesome. Dark Knight Rises better be good, because the competition is fierce this year!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly good and entertaining,"I never had expectations for this one even amidst the amazing promotion except that the guy from 'The Social Network' is the lead and Emma Stone <3 is the love interest so I was surprised that I enjoyed it very much aside from the charm Emma Stone gives. I thought Andrew Garfield wouldn't fit the role but he proved me wrong as, while watching the film, I believed he was Peter Parker and the way he improved or evolved the character in the movie is good. Their chemistry is great.This is the more realistic version of Spiderman (artificial web slinger) and I'm sure a lot of people would enjoy the path it took as a whole. Great effects, great soundtrack, great cast and acting, and some nice action sequences.I'm giving it 8 out of 10... or 9 but either way, it is a good film especially to those who are just looking for a good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Spider-Man v. The Amazing Spider-Man:  ""Amazing"" wins by a knockout","Both movies are great for their times. And though I enjoyed both, I liked ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" a bit more. Why? Better acting, more gritty and realistic feel, better special effects. This movie benefits from learning from the many movies that came before it: Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Iron Man, etc. Andrew Garfield nails Peter Parker with his outstanding performance, and Emma Stone was gorgeous as Gwen Stacy. While I had to stretch my imagination a bit to see Kirsten Dunst as a supermodel/actress, there was no stretching with Emma Stone. I enjoyed the retelling of the origin from the vantage point of a new director. Definitely not a rehash. The web swinging and fight scenes totally knocked it out of the park, especially in 3D.The biggest negative to me was the costume...should have stayed closer to the comic book classic. Yellow eyes, really? A stripe on the side of his pants? Redesigning the spider logo was fine, but I would have pretty much left it at that. Otherwise, highly enjoyable and recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worth watching once,I may say its a kids movie.Good utilization of 3D and graphics Good fun and entertainment for a below 15 year old kid.Movie is worth watching for once just because it is not boring.But don't expect something great.There is nothing catchy and no situation which can be kept in mind I didn't felt any serious threats in the movie.Villain was a total waste.When fight scenes came i felt like 2 school kids putting some show like in some cartoon. Nothing to admire or no moral background. The old Spider Man movie series is always the best and old Peter Parker is the one i admire.The Peter Parker in this new movie was active agile and very athletic.But we don't expect someone who plays the role of a very responsible superhero to be an immature kid.The Truth is he couldn't create the real impact on our mind as old Peter Parker did.,5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Story!,"First off I would like to say I get kind of annoyed when people write bad reviews to a movie that going into it they weren't very opened minded about. I will be the first to admit that I was kind pretty upset when they decided to reboot this series, and I was totally against going to see it when I heard what they were doing. I changed my mind after watching the previews for the movie. I also get annoyed when comic book nerds write bad reviews because they were insulted by the fact that the movie had nothing to do with the comic book. If you are expecting the movie to be like the comics then just don't go to them.With that said, I really liked the story line of this movie. It was the untold story about Peter Parkers dad and the mystery that surrounded him. I think that they found the perfect replacement for Tobie Maguire. Andrew Garfield really brought Peter Parker's character to life. I really liked the comical side to this Spider-man that wasn't present in the original versions. They took the working format (the darkness)from the Dark Knight franchise and made it work with this movie. Emma Stone did a great job play Gwen Stacy and Rhys Ifans did a great job playing Dr. Connors/Lizzard. The action sequences where really good and I really like the direction that they seem to be going with this franchise and I am looking forward to see what they have in store for the rest of the series.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
IMHO best Spider Man in the series,"I like this Spider Man the best out of all that are in the series maybe because in keeping with the ""amazing"" series, the styling and action are edgier and darker and just out there. Garfield makes a much much better Peter Parker than the Frodo-esque Tobey Maguire (sorry Tobey, no hard feelings) with slimmer and taller figures albeit younger...and a lot more emo than the already emo Spider Man 3 (remember the Sandman vs Venom vs spidey scene in the end? YIKES). Looks physically more accurate Spider Man in costume too. Though Garfield can be annoying to watch at times, at least to me becoz I know people just gush over him here, I still can see him as Erik Larsen's or Bagley's Peter Parker. I didn't see that at all with Tobey.And where Garfield slacks up, there's always the beautiful Emma Stone to save the day. Really - I firmly believe that it was Emma, not Garfield, who is the real star in this movie. And who saves the movie. I think she is brilliant as Gwen Stacy.The Lizard, ah well what can I say. Not memorable. Nowhere near Nolan's Joker. Captain Stacy, funny how he somehow, somehow resembles William Dafoe - Green Goblin to me. I just can't shake it off.Love, love the webbing effects and the web shooters. Finally, web shooters! And done well,too,matching the comic's lengthy make- believe descriptions. Yup, this is the most accurate Spider Man film thus far, right down to the web head's signature smart Alec fighting style and numerous ""shut it!"" webbing to the mouth (this Spider Man LOVES throwing webbing onto people's mouths). But then again, about capt. Stacy... Well if I say it it's going to be a spoiler so I'm going to let you watch it. Spider fans should notice a major inaccuracy with capt. Stacy.The effects are again, to me, the best in the series. I'm talking about spidey-related effects. The web swinging thru the city, oh the web swinging. Simply. Amazing. Well done. Just trust me when I say cough up the extra dollars and watch this on Imax. 3D is optional, but Imax is non-negotiable.I learned this the hard way. But I will rectify this situation this weekend when I will be re-watching the Amazing Spider Man... On Imax.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is an awesome film - you guys don't know what you're talking about,"First, I haven't written a review on IMDb in years but I must jump in here because of all the horrible reviews. They're wrong. This is a brilliant Spider-Man movie. I thought it was awesome. I loved the original Spider-Man trilogy. And this one is amazing too.I'm tired of these hardcore comic book guy fans on IMDb being too good for this film and calling it garbage. Look Stan Lee stands by his work. Like any artist, he loves his creation, demands quality, and if he was involved in the production of this movie and signed off on this... it's f-ing good. If the creator okayed it... who are you?I'm just glad someone took the time to get this movie made. Movies are hard to make. Deals fall apart. And something happened in the movie, unlike some movies where nothing happens. i.e Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1I'm not going to sit around and let people bad mouth Marc Webb's film just because it didn't match what some had in their heads. It's a different director so it's going to be a different rendition. I read reviews complaining about the music that was used in different scenes and how Peter shouldn't have beat up the guys in the subway. Come on, are you serious? Why don't you go make your own film then. I literally cannot believe how much ""don't-you-dare-touch-my- facebook"" like people are being with this film. Why don't you complain about how the music wasn't loud enough at 32:49?Second, this is what I thought about the film. I remember reading the original comics with Gwen in them and watching the TV show with Curt Connors so I was really glad to see these characters on screen. It was really cool. It was a fun, exciting, and moving film. The acting was great. The visuals were super. The story was entertaining. And to all the comic book guy fans out there, of course it's predictable! You've read the comics. It's like reading the spoilers and then complaining the movie sucked because you knew what was going to happen.Third, I'm annoyed that because of the bad reviews I put off watching this film for almost a year. I don't want other people to make the same mistake. If you like Spider-Man and want to watch a quality movie, this is it. You're going to be entertained and love it. I think it's just as good at Dark Knight and Avengers.Sincerely,Taige",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
amazing,"The film was all the way amazing. Andrew portrayed Spider-Man extremely well. This new film gives us a better take on spider man. Growing up with spider man, I always knew what he was like, and this new film has a closer take to the comics. The romance was great as well, along with the action. The lizard was a great character as well. The effects were really well done. The 3d was actually worth it, and was of course well done. Emma stone portrayed the young miss Stacy well enough to make the viewers believe as if she came right out of the comics. This film was all the way amazing, and is a definite see. This shouldn't be compared to Avengers, or Dark Knight Rises, as its a film on its own. Some scenes made me feel as if I was actually spider man. The film is great for everyone of all ages. kids, teens, and adults.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Not so amazing spiderman...,"10 years after the Raimi's Spiderman comes out the rebooted nolan-ish The amazing spiderman.. The movie is so heavily inspired by the brilliant Nolan Dark Knight, that it gives the feeling that they have just replaced batman with spiderman in those movies...They even have an officer gordon replacement in this movie.. Most of the movie gives you a Deja Vu Feeling..Parker cant talk to the girl..The science lab spider...The uncle Ben Dying speech...the search for the killer.. Also you have to have J. Jonah Jameson and daily bugle in a spiderman movie..how could they miss that.. its only after Doc Connors turns into the Lizard that you feel you are watching a new movie..

Loved it!!,"I really liked this film.I was never really a person who was a big fan of superhero movies but this movie has turned me into a superhero fan.I absolutely love Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, they are perfect together!I did miss Harry Osborne and Mary Jane, them being known as Peters best friend and girlfriend. The people who first loved the original could possibly be upset they weren't there, as i am, although I love the character Gwen Stacey and think that they worked that perfectly into the film.I love how for this film they went a bit further into the story of Peters father, although it wasn't much it was still something to explain a few things that had people wondering from the original films (which were also great!)To sum up, i loved this film. As the title states, it was amazing. So, to sum up, i thought the movie was, as the title states, amazing!! I can't wait until the second comes out",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This was truly amazing,"So I was a Hugh fan of the other Spider-Man franchise before I seen this movie, and I can safely say this is the better adaption, the acting,sets and general story is just better! It doesn't matter if the reboot was necessary or not cause the movie is completely different from the other Spider-Man, this is my favorite movie of all time just sayen.... Andrew Garfield and Emma stone are amazing in this movie there chemistry in undeniable. This movie also stays true to the comic. This adaption has mystery,romance, real relationships and real struggles! You need to give it a chance just cause its new and different dose not mean its bad. Plese just watch it and then make up your mind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Amazing Spiderman,"Peter Parker (played by Andrew Grafield) was just a teenage student at Mid-Town science university and who was one day went to the Oscorp tower to look for his father workmate, but instead he found something else that would change his life forever and have to face many changes in his life and also found love with Gwen Stacy (played by Emma Stone). During his change, he encountered so many problem that every others normal teenagers at his age have never encountered before but he knew he alone will have to face and solve those problem at all cost and that is include the way to defeat his powerful enemy that he have never thought before to save and bring back peace to New York City.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best Spider-Man trilogy,"The Andrew Garfield spider man is the best one in my opinion (yes, I said it. Deal with it).The comedy is spot on, the suit design was incredible, the story was deep and the plot was solid. I really enjoyed this movie and choosing Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker was a really good decision.The CGI was fantastic and in this movie we finally got to see a little bit more in depth the other characters that weren't Peter.The story isn't 100% accurate to the comics, but hang in there, watch the second movie and you're in for an immersive plot full of mysteries that slowly start to uncover.The one thing that I don't like is actually an issue I have with a lot of superhero instalments. Just a few days after the main character gets his powers, he already manages to go head-to-head with full-on supervillains. I like for example that in the Tom Holland trilogy, Peter has been Spider-Man for a while and has a bit more experience, while this movie has the same old issue.But a part from that, I really loved this movie. Would recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
You have to be kidding me,"Explain to me why my favorite actress was placed in this movie and then allowed herself to act like a fifty year old woman? Shame on the director for picking that actor to play spiderman as he was just an irritating waste of visual disturbance. The movie was slow, didn't develop any new plot lines and for the most part, was the exact same movie as the first spiderman with some of the names changed. It is time to pull the plug on this franchise as I will not waste another moment or a dime of my money watching a hack play spiderman and watching a great actress like Emma, play a hack. By the way, my 8 year old son could have directed this movie as well if not better than it was directed. The story lacked belief, which is really sad since we all suspend our disbelief to watch this crap.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Super Powers Indeed!,"This film is highly recommended.""Amazing"" is such an overused adjective that rarely is in sync with its subject. The Amazing Kreskin...The Amazing Race...Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat...The Amazing Colossal Man...The Amazing Colossal Woman. Never achieving its own sense of greatness, the word attains a self-congratulatory smugness and usually leads to disappointment. And now we have The Amazing Spiderman, yet another trendy remake of a comic book superhero, a re-boot of this film trilogy that is barely a decade old!Now, The Age of the Comic Book Hero Movie may seem like the latest fad, but it's been with us for years, although their emergence feels all too frequent due to the many misfires and hyperbole. These fantasy action blockbusters occur with such regularity that it's far easier to count the films that aren't from that genre than to observe the glut of fanboy extravaganzas that take up space in today's movie theaters.( Yes, I do fondly remember, somewhere back in the fifties, between double features and sitting in the fourth row of the Palace Theater, being one of those very young and easily gullible movie fans, watching a national yo-yo competition after that first feature, as kid after kid would walk up on that stage to ""amaze"" the audience with tricks like Walking the Dog, Boingy Boing, and The Sleeper. ( I, on the other hand, being so uncoordinated, was lucky to get this spinning toy back up the string into my wet waiting palm! ) And then...we waited for the main event, the second feature to appear on the big screen: Superman and the Mole People ( starring George Reeves with his strings attached ) as our superhero conquered the enemies by actually flying in the air amid the squeals and shouts of all the neighbor boys in that crowded movie house. But I digress....)The young audience of today is much more savvy and the expensive budget lavished on special effects are superior to those visible invisible wires attached to our superheroes that we chose to ignore as children. But the thrill is still the same for youngsters and, nowadays, oldsters alike. Which finally brings us full circle to our main event, The Amazing Spiderman, an entertaining and special film that takes its legend seriously and its source as gospel. It's popcorn entertainment alright, but with some degree of sophistication and unexpected joy. This time they got it right and The Amazing Spiderman, illogic withstanding, is one of the best action films of the summer!I won't belabor the plot of the film as we have seen it all before, although there are some clever minor changes. Let's just say Peter Parker gets bit by that radioactive, or biologically engineered, spider and adapts to his life as misunderstood webbed crusader, meeting various nemeses and fighting against the forces of evil. The film truly takes flight in its early scenes of Spidey's self-discovery of his new strength and agility in these introductory phases. ( A delightful subway sequences uses humor and CGI to reinforce the elements of awe and wonder simultaneously as Parker's initiation into superhero mode begins. )Some differences from the original: a new love interest, namely Gwen Stacy ( Emma Stone ), a new villain, The Lizard a.k.a. Dr. Curt Connors ( very well played by Rhys Ifan ), and, of course, a new actor in the title role, smashingly played Andrew Garfield. These additions help make this Spiderman 4.0 all the more enjoyable. High praise goes to the film's director, Marc Webb, who wisely invests in the characters and their dilemmas before much superhero action takes place. This makes many of the later scenes have more dramatic clout. The screenplay by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves adds plenty of subtle humor in its exchanges between the two lovers and creates an interesting conflicted villain who is not just the persona of evil. It is so refreshing that the director and screenwriters actually take the time to delve into the backgrounds of the characters involved before going into the fancy aerial acrobatic maneuvers and sci-fi plottingThey realize the human story is as important as the theatrics. It is the relationship of Peter and Gwen that elevates the film to an entirely different level from most ordinary comic book hero films. Although Stone and Garfield are too old for their teenage roles, they play off each other so well. Stone brings to her role a charm and intelligence that beguiles the audience. Garfield, pardon the pun, is a Marvel as Spiderman. This talented actor plays him as a rebel with a cause, a modern day James Dean in uniform. Garfield captures the pent-up energies of an adolescent loner with his gawky posturing and nervous tics. His ability to convey sensitivity and inner turmoil, plus his good looks, define this role to the max.I would be amiss if I did not point out that here are some glaring inconsistencies throughout The Amazing Spiderman, who, I might add, is even a more ""amazing"" fashion designer with his seamless removable mask and sewing skills. Some minor villains and future plot complications are introduced and then disappear into that dark night. Photographed with a breathtaking fluidity by John Schwartzman, the action set pieces are exciting and well staged, with wonderful visual effects, but the climactic showdown defies logic and goes on too long.The Amazing Spiderman definitely lives up to its own hype. It may not meet the ""amazing"" standard of excellence but it is a marvelous Marvel for us to behold. No strings attached.

A re-boot that beats the Original,"In 2002, Sam Raimi brought us Spider-Man and 10 years later Marc Webb gives us The Amazing Spider-Man, and that's what the film is - Amazing.Peter Parker (Garfield)was abandoned by his parents as a boy and raised by his Uncle Ben (Sheen) and Aunt May (Field). Peter is also finding his way with his first high school crush, Gwen Stacy (Stone). As Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father, he begins a quest to understand his parents' disappearance - leading him directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr. Curt Connors (Ifans), his father's former partner. As Spider-Man is set on a collision course with Connors' alter- ego, The Lizard.Andrew Garfield is perfect for the role of Peter Parker and does a better job with the character than his predecessor, Tobey Maguire. He adds more emotion to the character. It is amazing to see his journey and see his character evolve. His goofy and shy personality contrasts well with the intensity he brings to Spider-Man.Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy, the love interest, daughter of Captain Stacy(head of police) and intern for Dr Curt Conners. The chemistry between Garfield and Stone is adorable and its very fun to watch to couple's love story unfold. Gwen is more than a damsel in distress as opposed to Mary Jane from the past movies. Her role is quite crucial in the movie and Emma Stone was a prefect choice.Rhys Ifans plays Dr. Curt Conners, the antagonist of the film, and the alter ego - The Lizard. His life's work as a Biologist studying gene mutations quickly becomes his downfall as what he thought was a cure led to his demise. Ifans is a very satisfying villain and does a great job with the role.I'm not a huge Spider-Man fan but this movie managed to persuade me. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the character or in the mood for a good hero movie.With these young talents, strong performances by the cast, great special effects, a well written and well directed film, The Amazing Spider-Man is truly... Amazing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Different, Witty, Classy ........but lacks somewhat emotionally","Well, This movie surely has a charm of its own & has the potential to be one of the biggest blockbusters this year. The reboot has been made very cleverly to make audience feel a complete different watching experience. Mark Webb's spider-man is witty, thoughtful, he does not take everything too seriously while Sam Raimi's spider-man was intense, dreamy about Marry Jane (MJ), basically he seemed like a poor guy who had nobody to help. At least the portrayal of the character was like that but in Mark Webb's version he seems more confident & cool.Despite all that has been said, it looks like the makers of this film has deliberately chosen to diverge from plot situations that were present in the former version. In fact it had helped in building of characters but here, TAS(the amazing spider-man)lacks in this aspect. Moreover, it also lacks in the background score. I would not say that it should have been made in exact same way Raimi had made it but TAS is weak in its emotional quotient. Forgive me for comparing it to Raimi's version over and over again but Raimi's less than 2 hrs long film was more dramatic than this more than 2 hrs long film. Although TAS preserves spider-man's integrity and has the full potential to be made into a franchise.This movie(TAS) was a lot fast paced and therefore it didn't give too much time to audiences to sit back and relate to the characters. But, a big thumbs up for its wittiness, humor, CGI, action. What it lacks is emotion which was a result of avoidance of using basic plot details for the fear of being compared to 2002 Spider-man. So, watch this movie. It will surely surprise you at times but don't go with a certain mindset. Also, This movie does't have a conventional ending which i liked the most. Spider-man comic fans will surely like The Amazing Spiderman over Spider-man as this version is more close to the comics strictly in terms of the character Spiderman that is usually shown.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"HANDS DOWN, ANDREW GARFIELD IS THE BEST SPIDER-MAN YET!!!!","Emma Stone plays a great Gwen...Garfield is so much more believable just as a human being & definitely as Spider-Man; real acting at its finest. Seriously, Tobey MaGuire as Spider-Man ???!! Really ? PLEASE...just as believable as a ""sexy"" maniacal lover in 50 Shades of Gray! Sorry Tobey, but what a weird performance that was (Spider-Man). Especially as the ""Dark Spidey"". Total turn-off. Kirsten Dunst was the best thing about this take of the movie. Of course, Sally Fields & Martin Sheen are always fantastic...goes without saying. It was fun, action packed, showed great emotion, fantastic CGI, intelligence in the writing, vulnerability in the characters, especially Spider-Man, AND just all around enjoyment. That's how movies should be! Too much NOT left to the imagination, too much typical everyday bloody violence, too much inappropriate language, and way too many awful storylines...what happened to all the good, clean, FUN, action packed, FAMILY movies!? Well...this movie covers all those bases & is what we need more of...like all the MARVEL movies, which I could watch over & over again. I mean what is wrong with motion pictures that have some values & principles, some kindness, some ""do the right thing"" storylines that are exciting, but imaginative too? No wonder so much Reality TV, because not ENOUGH GOOD decent scripts are written anymore...life is full of harsh realities...do we always need them shoved down our throats !?This review is much more about what we should be watching. What we can let our children watch, and not what is a waste of time & money. From where I'm sitting, I say BRAVO !!
