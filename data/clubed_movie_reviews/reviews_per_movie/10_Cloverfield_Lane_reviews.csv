A claustrophobic and suspenseful mystery-thriller.,"Arguably, the worst aspects of '10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)' are those that tie into its franchise roots, which is understandable considering that this started life as a completely original screenplay before it was contorted to fit into the 'Cloverfield (2008)' ""universe"". These issues are really only limited to a somewhat rushed finale, though, and the final result is still a much finer film than its predecessor. It's an incredibly intriguing and evolving mystery-thriller that's consistently entertaining and suspenseful, as it uses its small core cast of well-realised characters to drive the tension within its (mostly) single, increasingly claustrophobic location to expert effect. It's incredibly compelling mainly because of its intense focus on character, while it's the several subtle twists and turns that keep us on the edge of our seat as our reading of the situation (always seen through the lens of the protagonist) continues to organically change. Ultimately, the piece becomes perhaps one of the most enjoyable entries in its genre. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
But what genre?,"It had been a good many years since watching Cloverfield, and upon watching the trailer for 10 Cloverfield Lane, I had a pretty solid idea of how this new movie was going to pan out. Now maybe this trailer only showed in Europe or perhaps even just Britain where I'm from, because I can't for a moment believe that people didn't expect exactly what was going to happen after watching the 3 minutes of footage? The twist was given away. The plot spoiled. Anyone with half a brain could've deduced the entirety of the story from the trailer.So, saying that, I knew what to expect. I went into watching the movie with a pretty strong idea of what was going to happen- and I wasn't far off.The first 3 quarters of this movie is one movie in itself, and the last quarter is an entirely different one. So far from one another in terms of genre that even despite knowing what was going to happen, I was still stunned by the total change.The first 3/4 is, honestly, extremely well done. John Goodman portrays such a convincing creepiness and terrifying instability that I found my skin crawling in almost every scene he was in. He completely steals the movie for me. And thank God, because without him I don't think there would be much to hold it up. The psycho-thriller element to this movie is fantastic. If it had remained solely within that genre, I think you'd be working with a solid 9/10.But the ending just sours it for me. Expected, but not enjoyable. Cool CGI and action is great in itself but after a buildup of drama and tension and claustrophobic social interactions, it just feels odd and misplaced.All in all, a great movie that's thoroughly worth watching- but I feel the sharp deviation at the end will either confuse and disappoint, or be a snippet of excitement that isn't nearly satisfying enough.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
What are people throwing shade on this movie?,"Pluses: 1. Great cast. Really good chemistry among them. Terrific performances from all. Mary Elizabeth Winstead gets better with every film she makes. 2. Story keeps you guessing until the end. 3. There are references in it to some popular films in the genre (that are likely film maker favorites) from the past 30 years or so. 4. Director shows great promise while still early in his career. 4. Story more important than special effects or pointless action sequences (always a plus for me). 5. Sound effects, usually unappreciated in non-action films, well used to add to the intensity of the drama.Minuses: 1. We've probably all seen John Goodman play a similar character before. 2. There's a possible murder that took place prior to the film, a plot device never resolved.Since the film has the word ""Cloverfield"" in the title, a lot of dim light bulbs thought this was a prequel or sequel to the other film and bad mouthed it because it isn't. Using Cloverfield in the title was likely just another reference to a favorite film.Some people didn't understand the ending. Huh? They must have fallen asleep during the rest of the movie (when they realized it wasn't Cloverfield 2) or this generation is dumber than I fear it might be. The actions of Winstead's character at the end of the film make perfect sense in light of a monologue she delivered earlier, which apparently was ignored by those whining about the ending.Don't listen to the naysayers. It isn't high art, but it's an entertaining film that will hold your attention to the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the better ones this year,"I explicitly avoid watching any trailers or reading any reviews from 10 Cloverfield Lane just because I wanted to be certain to be surprised by the story. I just heard from some people that it was good and that's all I needed to know. And I'm glad I did because during the whole entire movie you wonder what is really happening. You think about all the possible scenarios and still you are never sure what is going on. I like those kind of movies, mysteries, that keep you on edge all the time. The cast did a perfect job with their respective performances. And even though there are almost no other actors then the three main ones, John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr, the movie never gets boring. It's full of twists and that's how I like it. One of the better ones I saw this year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Less action than in the first film in this belated  sequel,"Belated pseudo-sequel to the divisive 2008 movie Cloverfield. That first film dealt with an unexplained giant monster attack in NYC, and was shot in the ""found footage"" style: everything shot with a video camera, as if by one of the characters within the film, with all the shakiness and amateurishness one would expect. The idea is to lend the film added verisimilitude and place the viewer within the narrative. This works only occasionally, and in my opinion Cloverfield was one time that it did. However, that being said, this sequel does away with that narrative device, and is shot in a traditional, stationary manner, with known actors and professional cinematography.The story follows Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a young woman in an unhappy relationship who packs her bags and hits the road, leaving her boyfriend and driving toward parts unknown. She suffers a terrible car accident, and when she awakens, she's chained up in the underground bomb shelter of the distinctly odd Howard (John Goodman), a conspiracy theorist and survival nut who claims that while Michelle was unconscious, the world up above has come to an end. What caused it, he isn't sure (Russian nukes? Terrorist bio-weapons? Alien invaders?), but he knows it isn't safe to step outside. Also in the shelter is goofy country boy Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), a former employee of Howard's in the construction of the shelter.The vast majority of the movie is a slow-burn suspense drama, as Michelle tries to learn more about her surroundings, and the two roommates she's now forced to live with. You know Howard isn't all there, but just how far gone is he? Or are his most outlandish claims only the tip of the iceberg? These scenes are well-done for the most part, and the actors are all good, especially Goodman, who uses his bulk to great advantage. Winstead does great work as well, using her eyes more than anything to project her performance. The problems for me came in the relatively uninspired script. There wasn't really a beat in the film that I didn't see coming, and all of the characters ended up where I expected them to be within the first 10 minutes. The dialogue, too, while showing a tiny bit of wit here and there, didn't hold my attention as well as I hoped. I won't go into the film's last act, only to say that ""Cloverfield"" is in the title for a reason, but don't expect the giant monster action of the first film. Directorial debut of Dan Trachtenberg. From Paramount.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Decent mystery except the ending,It would have been solid 8 or 9 if it wasn't for the ending. Except that it was quite an intense mystery.,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great claustrophobic story with fine performances... and a twist,"Full disclosure: The year is 2007. A trailer hits cinema screens advertising a mysterious film named ""Cloverfield."" Nobody knows what it's about, except that it's riding on the wave of the found footage genre, and that it seems to depict a giant monster attack on New York. Speculation immediately breaks out all over the internet, but nowhere more fiercely than on the IMDb forums, with many folks being caught up in the genius viral marketing. I myself was one of those people, along with my wife. Yes, we met on IMDb's Cloverfield forum. She moved from the US to Australia a few years after, we got married, and we've lived together happily ever since.Yes, that is the power of film; it can bring people together in the most unlikely ways possible.So, it's with some excitement that we were blindsided by the brief and vague advertising campaign for 10 Cloverfield Lane. Does it have any connections to the original Cloverfield? What's JJ Abrams playing at here, exactly? Without giving too much away, it's not a direct sequel, but rather a sequel in tone. I'm assuming Abrams is going for an anthology style series here, with each entry being a different story tied together by their themes and science-fiction setting. It's clearly a marketing thing, but if that means we'll get more films like this, I'm certainly okay with it.10 Cloverfield Lane eschews its predecessor's found-footage trappings, and immerses us in a classic style bottle thriller. The setting is limited and claustrophobic, and the cast small, but the story and tension will grab you and not let up until the end. The nature of the mystery means your opinion will hang very precariously on whether you like that ending, and I suspect it will be divisive. There's not a great deal of resolution, and if I'm correct in assuming this will be an anthology series from now on, I doubt we'll ever get any. But that's fine, because I don't think the story that would follow the film really needs to be told.What matters are the performances. John Goodman is the real draw card here. He gives a stunning turn that is delightful, sympathetic and absolutely terrifying in equal doses. He's had so many great roles in the past, but he is unforgettable here. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is also very likable as the resourceful protagonist. Perhaps a little too resourceful at times, but for the most part we're with her happily throughout.The film looks fantastic despite the cramped environs, with great use of color and shadow and some interesting cinematography. There are some nice designs and special effects toward the end of the film, even if they may be considered a little derivative. The score is tense and effective, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.The script is great with very little flab, and if you like these kinds of stories which lock characters together in tight, paranoid spaces then you'll find a lot to enjoy here. Just don't go in expecting Cloverfield 2, because this is not it. It's its own beast, and has a brave ending that you'll either love or hate.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An incredible ride from beginning to end.,"To describe 10 Cloverfield Lane in one word: Genreless.I won't say much about the film as I'm a strong believer of going in blind, but I will say that the performances, writing, and cinematic pacing worked perfectly together to create a truly unique film.I loved watching it, and the moments of comedy sprouting up throughout made the duality between light-hearted humanity and dark confusion work perfectly together. I would give the Titles and Credits 10/10 as well, because they were just so damn fantastic and fresh and reminded me that titling is an art form like any other in the cinematic Genre. If you enjoy good film, you will enjoy 10 Cloverfield Lane.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
10 Cloverfield Lane,"Two months ago, no one knew that 10 Cloverfield existed, let alone was about to be wide released in theaters. One month ago, no one had any idea how, if at all, this film was related to the 2008 film Cloverfield except for the obvious title and produced J.J. Abrams. And now, all is revealed. Sort of. Here's my review.One of the greatest things 10 Cloverfield Lane has to offer is that the audience really has no idea what to expect going into the film. Very much in the J.J Abrams way, the production for this film has been left completely under-wraps and the trailers have revealed next to nothing. That's one of the benefits for the movies, so I'm not going to spoil or give anything away in my synopsis or the review. I won't even tell you if this movie is indeed a Cloverfield sequel or if it's something different altogether. You'll have to find out for yourself, because I can tell you right now that you should spend the money to go see it in theaters.I'll be brief. A woman we know very little about named Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is involved in a car crash in a breath taking opening credit sequence. She wakes up a few days later to find herself in an underground bunker with Howard (John Goodman), a large and crazed eyed farmer standing above her. He tells her that she can't leave, because some sort of disaster has happened and it's not safe to go outside. Finding herself alone with Howard and another man named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), and I'm stealing their tag line here because it's a dang good tag line, they find out that Monsters come in many forms.Obviously I had no idea to expect when I went into 10 Cloverfield Lane. No one did. But within the first five minutes they set the tone so you know what kind of movie they are going for, and I found myself instantly engaged. For the rest of the film, I was floored with what was going on. Director Dan Trachtenberg takes the reigns on creating a film that will hit you with the unexpected, and leave your jaw hanging.The best word I could think of to describe this film while I was watching it was claustrophobic. For the scenes that takes place in the bunker (I'm not saying how much of the screen time that actually is) they create such an intense and nervous atmosphere that you feel yourself getting antsy along with the characters.That's because for almost the whole film, we don't really know what's going on. We know what John Goodman is telling us and leading us to believe, but we have no idea if that's reliable or not. We discover things along with the characters, which is why this film is such a good build up. When the conclusion to the film finally comes, you leave more than satisfied. But don't ruin it for yourself by looking up online spoilers to see if it is a Cloverfield sequel. Spend the money. See the movie. Find out for yourself. It's worth it.I've heard the argument and I've sited it a few times in past reviews, that the best way to bring out great performances in actors is to lock them in a single setting film where they having nothing to hide their performance behind. That's what happens here. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, an actress who deserves to get more work than she does, played the character so well as she captures the nervous ticks without acting completely helpless the whole time. In the end, she was pretty bad-ass. John Gallagher Jr., a character who could have been super annoying, ended up being great in the film too, and had really good chemistry with Mary Elizabeth Winstead.But the stand-out of the film if John Goodman. John Goodman is in so many films every year that we sometimes take him for granted and forget how good of an actor he can be when he's not mailing it in (whatever Hangover film he was in. I forget) but rather commits whole heartedly to a role. That's what happens here. He could have easily over-cooked his performance where it came of as cartoon-y or unrealistic, but he hit just the right level of disturbing and off-putting where you are crept out by the guy but you can't be sure if he's in the right or wrong. It's a performance similar to Joel Edgerton's in The Gift.ALSO just read on IMDb that Bradely Cooper's voice appeared over a cell-phone in one scene. I knew I had heard the voice somewhere but I couldn't put my finger on it until now.At no point of 10 Cloverfield Lane does the film slow down or lose interest. It uses it's hour and forty five minute runtime, a surprisingly long one for this type of film, to achieve the best possible effects. The film flies by and I found myself never wanting it to be over.10 Cloverfield Lane is a movie you should rush out to the theater to go see. Accept that you know nothing about it going in, and enjoy that experience. Because it's something that doesn't happen often and it's a rare gift when it does. 10 Cloverfield Lane has a lot to offer despite the fact that it's a very small film. In fact, regardless of the fact if they are in the same universe, I'll say I enjoyed 10 Cloverfield Lane more than I enjoyed Cloverfield itself. And I want to see the story continued in a sequel. 10 Cloverfield Lane gets an A-, it's one of my favorite films of 2016 so far. Go see it this weekend. "" - brands42",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Thrilling, Breathtaking...","First things first, after watch this movie you will learn that nothing is what it seems to be.At the beginning you will appreciate what appears to be a well made drama, after a while you will be immersed in a thriller with some awesome actors providing you moments of fear, sadness, uneasiness, terror and disbelief.The story will make you doubt the movie at first but don't let it make you give up of watching it. You will certainly be captured by the fast changes in the narrative transforming this movie from one thing to another, where in a moment you will be happy watching it and a second after you will be terrorized by something; or wanting to know what is really happening and a moment after seeing all your beliefs crushing down by another event that reveals itself.It is a awesome movie that anyone who wants to watch different stories should invest an hour in it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Powerful and shocking mystery,"10 Cloverfield Lane gives all the development and the meaningful story that its blood relative installment lacked completely. This is not a spectacle full of screams and special effects. This is a spectacle of tension and suspense of epic proportions. This is a really feel-bad movie at certain points.First of all, you have to take the leap of faith and go ahead watching without knowing anything of the plot. Don't worry because all the teasers doesn't reveal anything important, but don't try to search information. If everything were that easy, even Hitchcock or Nolan movies would lose all interest.I was extremely hooked since the furious start to the eye popping and surprising finale. The direction is amazing and claustrophobic. The performances are great, looking up to a surprising Winstead and a unrestrained unforgettable turn by Goodman. The story is gleefully unapologetic delivering chills and full blooded twists (the biggest of all is the intense ending reveal) even thought it deviates from the monster POV storyline.Secretly made, impeccably marketed, nicely developed and finally here along with us: 10 Cloverfield Lane promised thrills and delivered it and then some. I was expecting some things that I tasted but I was surprised by a complexity and a twisted sense of horror that I didn't see coming. 2016 has released the very first great movie of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The Right Postcode!,"I'm probably in the minority, but I disliked Cloverfield ... intensely! So many of these found footage films as far as I'm concerned, are just an invitation to watch someone's tarted-up home movie. Their producers/directors should be commended for being excellent marketing strategists in being able to convince punters to part with their hard-earned, to watch some (generally) cheap, tacky B feature. Cloverfield was no exception.However in a significant turnaround, I'm happy to report that the Cloverfield's ""blood relative"" (according to JJ Abrams) is a much better production and a far more interesting story, than its predecessor. Technically speaking 10 CL is streets ahead, with the found footage format dispensed with and a small, but very professional cast employed in telling the story of 3 people dealing (not always on a voluntary basis) with life adjustments in a world affected by the events at the end of Cloverfield.The cast were uniformly good with Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle and John Goodman as Howard being the obvious lynchpins. Knowing virtually nothing about the storyline going into the film (apart from it having some vague relationship with Cloverfield), I have to admit I was pretty much hooked by the unfolding series of events affecting Michelle pretty early on. And as both her seemingly sometime antagonist and ally, Goodman's Howard is the perfect physical contrast. But very pleasing to see another independently resiliant and strong female lead character being featured in such a surprisingly entertaining and thrilling sequel as 10 CL turns out to be.Much has been commented about the film's climax. I have to admit to some ambivalence. This is where the relationship to the earlier film is given some clarification, whilst overtly setting up the stage for a later episode. Still rejoicing over the absence of found footage, I guess I could just about accept anything thrown up by the producers. I will admit to some disappointment in that the events are clearly played out in real time, with Michelle emerging from the shelter at what is clearly the beginnings of dusk. For some reason an unlikely darkness then overwhelms the setting within about a minute of screen time and with the subsequent taking up of hand-held cameras, the action suddenly becomes more difficult to discern. Though I was still somewhat relieved, I can understand how others may have experienced some disappointment.I'll admit to looking forward to the next instalment and even perhaps girding my loins and giving the original another watch, just to see again how well (if at all) it sets up this story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Part of this are a total 9, but it also drags at times, and is an awkward mash","10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)This is a tricky movie to review because it tries to do three different things, and it does two of them well. It's a movie that gets so much better as it goes, you hate the manipulative first twenty minutes more and more.The problem is worse because I don't want to give away the plot. There are a few key twists that are part of what makes the movie special. The last section, which I can't outline a bit, is by far the best part, and it isn't given time to develop. Oddly, the last part is also preposterous, and the main character survives against all logic, and the first sections of the film strive for true fictional accuracy.So, ultimately, the point of the film is to surprise and surprise. What really bothered me was the way the first section, where the leading woman is help captive (you learn this right away), tries to mislead us in a sensational way that doesn't make sense with the main central part of the film.John Goodman, the big name here, plays a survivalist who is portrayed as a good guy with a mixed up sense of justice (and some personal loose screws). He's pretty good, though doesn't command the role quite the way he does some others in his career. The shelter he's created is elaborate, and the crisis outside the shelter is kept ambiguous— and doubtful—which is a great bit of suspense.The final section almost seems to suggest a sequel—one that would be utterly different than this film.

The secrecy made everything better! (NO SPOILERS),"First of all, if you want to watch '10 Cloverfield Lane', make sure to avoid any kind of spoilers on the internet. I will try to write this review without spoilers, even if it's a bit difficult considering the movie I just witnessed.'10 Cloverfield Lane' is an amazing mystery/suspense movie that serves as a sequel to the 2008 hit 'Cloverfield'. I have to say, it's hard to tell if the greatness of this movie is going to hold up in 10 years because of how everything surrounding the movie made it better, but I really really liked it.Me and my friend tried to avoid the spoilers on the internet and read as less as possible on the movie before we went to see it. Fortunately, the brilliant marketing campaign did not reveal anything about the story, and the fact that it was a sequel to 'Cloverfield' is going to make you constantly guess. Is it a traditional horror/suspense movie? Is it a monster movie? Where are the monsters? WHAT IS GOING? (Pretty much what I kept asking myself all along the movie)John Goodman was incredible, definitely the standout of this movie. The soundtrack was great, some jukebox oldies and a thrilling score.The movie starts with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) driving off from her marriage and taking the road to leave her husband. This is made with a perfect montage, and there's no dialogue for the first 4-5 minutes of the movie. Then, things take a turn and we are transported to the bunker you saw in the trailers.I will say it again, go watch this film, and don't read anything about it on the internet.

"Much better than the 2008 ""Cloverfield"" movie, this is about a gripping & intense story and raw tension rather than special effects and crushing things.","If this is going to be an anthology or if this is going to be followed by that rumored third installment that has been recently spoiled by J.J. Abrahms, I can say that nobody doubts about the secretly marketed ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a great movie on its own. And a movie that if it were spoiled by someone here or at any review would be cruel.Since the start it reveals to be a movie that doesn't hide an ace, but a hundred.The pace can be a little slow at the first half only to add more and more tension, hooking the audience and introducing them into the movie like they were one of the people inside that bunker.John Goodman will be a real trend the future days thanking its superb performance. He's so twisty, complex developed character. He and Mary Elisabeth Winstead make the movie shine alongside the story.The story is so little, then so game-changer, with twists and turns that are smart rather than empty. It's one of that makes you guess all the time.The ending is more of a bang than a whimper. Even when it succumbs to the action and polemic moves, it will leave you on a grim and high note, pestering for another outing if it's any good like this.If the ""Cloverfield"" that started it all was about speaking without breath and CGI scares, this ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is about deeper intentions, deeper tension and personal stuff that is scarier than a giant monster. While the connection to that movie is not so remarkable until the finale, this installment is so brilliant on its own, so well marketed (without ruining any twist) and so well ended that will surely please any viewer who were looking for a damn good movie.

Perfect reminder,"It isn't very often that you can go see a movie at the theater and not have the slightest idea of where it'll take you. Even more rare is when a movie like that delivers a wholly original story that's even more satisfying than you ever thought it would be.'10 Clover-field Lane' is a perfect reminder that films can still surprise us, delight us, and horrify us in a way that's never been done before. Mark my words, Dan Trachtenberg will be a force to be reckoned with in the future. His feature length directorial debut is a showcase for his absolute confidence and strength as a storyteller and filmmaker, and I can't wait to see what he does next.Of course, it always helps to have the likes of J. J. Abrams and Bad Robot standing behind you, and their experience and talent absolutely boosts this film into the stratosphere.As far as acting is concerned, Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives her best performance yet, and shows us a strong lead character who's completely believable in a situation that plays out like a horrible nightmare. Speaking of bad dreams, John Goodman turns in a performance unlike anything he's ever done before, and manages to be both strangely sweet and unbearably creepy. And John Gallagher, Jr. nails his roll perfectly and adds some much needed levity to a story that's almost overwhelmingly claustrophobic.I've been thinking about what film I could use to compare '10 Clover-field Lane' to, and while I think even a comparison to a specific film might give too much away, I feel safe in saying that it is absolutely Hitchcock. It's a brilliant, brilliant movie that's told in the best possible way: by showing, not telling.Go and see it as soon as you can.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A brilliant mystery that will keep you guessing until the end,"The first thing I'll say is that I'm not going to spoil a single thing about this film (other than how good it is), because everyone deserves the chance to see this film as I did - without a clue to the answer of the mystery and simply looking for any shred of evidence to guide my opinion. I actually had very little idea what kind of a film I was in for with '10 Cloverfield Lane'. I had seen 'Cloverfield' years back and mildly enjoyed it (according to the rating I gave it on IMDb) but could remember very little of it. I knew what the plot was about and that it was a ""found footage"" film but could remember almost zero specifics. I can tell you though that I won't be forgetting specifics about this sequel for a very long time.I love nothing more than a well created mystery where the audience are left in the same confused state as the character/s and are filling in the pieces of the puzzle as the same pace that they are. This is one of those films. I see it was originally titled 'The Cellar' before it was reworked into a 'Cloverfield' sequel and I can very well imagine it working all on its own as a stand-alone thriller.John Goodman is the star of the show. He truly can be a brilliant actor when he sets his mind to a character. He plays the role perfectly never giving away any more than he needs to and adds to the mystery surrounding everything perfectly. Mary Elizabeth Winstead also impressed me in the lead role. She's likable and bad ass depending on the scene and plays both equally well.I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this film. I think it helps when you go in with no real expectations (as I can imagine a lot of audience members doing for this type of film) and then just out of nowhere you find yourself enjoying the hell out of it. As previously stated I won't give anything away, which leaves my hands tied a touch in discussing one of the key aspects of the film.

He then explains to here that they're in an underground bunker with a second man (John Gallagher, Jr.) and that they won't be able to leave for several years due to some sort of attack.10 CLOVERFIELD LANE pretty much came out of nowhere with very little fan fare, which is pretty amazing in today's world where it seems everything is known and discussed years before the actual film is viewed. This semi-sequel to CLOVERFIELD isn't anything like that picture and it's best that you view this film without knowing too much about its plot or everything that happens. With that said, I'm going to avoid going into too many plot details so that I don't give anything away.Again, if you're expecting something like the original then get that out of your head because this film here is 97% mystery and it's a very impressive one at that. The entire set up takes place in this doomsday bunker but you never really know what's going on. Is Howard really a savior to these two people? If there really was an attack on the outside who was it from? Is Howard really just a creep and nothing happened on the outside? There are a lot of terrific questions asked throughout the picture and the viewer is pretty much as confused as the Michelle character because you really don't know what to believe and there are several twists and turns along the way.Director Dan Trachtenberg does an extremely impressive job with keeping the viewer guessing throughout the picture. The screenplay is quite intelligent and it's a story that I really respect because in this day and age you simply don't get too many movies that make you think. Usually movies require one big action scene after another but this one here is basically a character study with a terrific mystery wrapped around it. It also helps that both Winstead and Gallagher, Jr. are so good in their parts. Winstead is extremely strong as this character who is constantly thinking about the situation she's in. Then there's Goodman who turns in a masterful performance. He really has a lot to do from acting like the good guy to being rather creepy to making you wonder what's really lurking in his mind. The actor perfectly captures all of these feelings and it's really wonderful how he keeps you constantly watching him and wondering what his motives are.10 CLOVERFIELD LANE ends in a very impressive fashion but of course I'm not going to tell you what happens. The film works wonderfully well as a mystery and I loved the fact that it wasn't afraid to make you use your imagination as to what's going on.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An astonishing film...,"Can we just say... seriously...John Goodman? An incredible performance by him and his costars... The man has a resumé that is beyond reproach... TV comedy, Coen brothers films, the monsterverise... We have the incredible score by the great Bear McCreary. And a solid script. This film delivers on every front.Not quite a sequel to 'Cloverfield', but a fine companion piece. Showing another aspect of the 'event'...terrifying as it is...I'll go as far to say that this film holds its own as a stellar masterpiece. A lesson in tension, and a salute to the film-maker's willingness to take the chance... Thanks, JJ Abrams and Trachtenberg for making this real.... Thanks for breaching the barrier.Having shown this to many others, and enjoying their reactions - I think that congratulations are in order... Well done.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Glad I kept watching,"It starts out mysteriously with no dialogue for the opening 5 minutes, which is very effective in creating intrigue and interest.Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) crashes her car and wakes up locked inside a concrete vault, reminding me of the Saw movies. But from there we're introduced to Howard (John Goodman) and things turn very different and we soon learn the reason for their being underground in a fully liveable bomb shelter.The main thing that this movie did, somehow, was engage me for most of its duration, despite having slow parts where not much seems to happen. This can be attributed to the tension among the inhabitants, where growing suspicions of what's going on puts all on edge. It's done really well, the third occupant of the shelter is Emmett (John Gallagher Jr) and he contributes in small doses. It's really a 2 person movie and both Winstead and Goodman are the reasons for watching this.The final 10 minutes confused me and let the enjoyment down somewhat but up until then it's a good watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Could have been much better, but still a reasonable film.","The film is completely different to what I was expecting due to it being a sequel to Cloverfield, and a really nice idea for a film. The acting is good, particularly John Goodman (I cant think off the top of my head any time Goodman hasn't been great. If it weren't for Goodman this would be a 5/10.)Unfortunately there are enough points in the story where things happen or characters do things in order to let the story progress, but that make little to no sense in the process, to really take me out of the film completely.And the ending is so terrible and completely different to the rest of the film its like a section of a whole other film tacked onto the end. Really bizarre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Mind-Screwing In A Good Way,"10 Cloverfield Lane, in short, is about a creepy dude, Howard (John Goodman), who claims there's been a chemical attack and that's the reasoning behind keeping a young woman, Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), locked in a shelter under his equally-creepy farmhouse.Michelle doesn't believe it, she thinks he's kidnapped her. She was in a car crash, and Creepy Dude saved her. Ok, sure, but let's go to the hospital, demands Michelle. Nope, the air is poisoned, creepy Howard confidently tells Michelle, who by now is really sketched out. Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) is also locked in the shelter, but he says it's by his choice. He knew about the shelter because he saw Creepy Dud building it a long time ago, so when the attack happened, Emmett rushed over to the farmhouse and essentially forced his way in. Sounds believable, right? Even Creepy Dude is locked in the shelter with them. Is Emmett in on this thing, too?The story is pretty good and keeps you in the dark. Is creepy Howard telling the truth, or is he brainwashing these two victims? There's evidence of both. Creepy Dude keeps reminding Michelle that he saved her life and she should be a little more grateful. Can't she understand that? Creepy Dude is prone to violent outbursts, but don't worry he won't hurt you, it's just the stress. After all, no one really knows how long they'll all be underground. One year, two? That'll stress anyone out, for sure. Everything is pretty convincing; everyone's story makes sense. You'll be like, WTF?I like horror movies that focus less on gore and more on storytelling to scare. This is one of those movies. It's trippy and mind-screwing in a good way. 10 Cloverfield Lane is well done.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Solid, entertaining, bone-chilling thriller... even if you scraped that tacked-on ending away.","I know nothing about the Cloverfield franchise - and I had no interest in it before - but I recently heard that JJ Abrams has a habit of attaching the franchise to 2 random indie films to expand on the ""lore"". One of them is good, one of them is not. So this peaked my interest on what all the fuss is for Cloverfield and why everyone was watching its ""blood-relatives"". So I'm watching them in non-chronological order.But how was 10 Cloverfield Lane? If it weren't for that stupid last 10 minutes, it's actually fantastic. It's claustrophobic, suspenseful, smart, well-crafted, and reveals many plot points with more elegance than the average horror film. The performances are great, the built-up tension is excellent, the sound-design creepy, the characters are interesting, and the villain is horrifying. At times he seems sympathetic, kind, and charming, but other times a murderous, mentally-disturbed old guy that couldn't be played better by anyone else but John Goodman. It's best if you go in with no expectations or knowledge of the plot to let the clever script toy with your emotions more.But that doesn't mean you'll get a modern masterpiece. Some moments felt like they dragged on longer than they should and the silly ending loses a lot of tension. All the praise I've gushed about was apparent for most of the film, but at the very end producer JJ Abrams let the filmmakers reshoot a few scenes to let the Cloverfield lore shoved in in the most unsubtle way possible. It doesn't ruin the film, but it DID ruin a few scenes that were building up to something only to forget why it was even there. I'm not entirely sure if changing the ending will still make the film a flawless one as it does feel 15 minutes too long, but it wouldn't suddenly shift to sci-fi.It's still a solid, entertaining, and bone-chilling thriller that had the potential to be great but ended up being really good. If you have the weird Cloverfield interest that I have now, go watch. If you're not interested in Cloverfield, go watch. If you're a fan of Scott Pilgrim, then Ramona is the main lead. So... go watch!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I never thought I feel like this again,"Oh, my, god. I grew up reading John Christopher's trilogies, staying awake all night to finish them. I never thought the mystery, sci-fi and bizarre, so gratifying to me as a teenager, would repeat now as an adult. I'm so glad I was proven wrong.I'm just gonna praise the film some more, so not to ruin anything for you. Oh, did they pull this off. This is a story very, very well-told.This is the kind of mastery in sci-fi story-telling I thought was lost forever. And this isn't a remake or just a good mishmash of previous short stories or films, but is totally original. Despite its mastery, I wouldn't have been surprised if it became a cult classic. But it seems it's having more audience than a niche group of nerds with good taste!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Cloverfield lame... ending,"""10 Cloverfield Lane"" makes you wonder how studio execs come up with film conceptsSCENE: The Production Office at Bad Robot. JJ Abrams and Bryan Burk are sat in front of a hat full of torn up bits of a Maltin's Film Guide.ABRAMS: ""I've got Bambi""BURK: ""I've got Schindler's List. No, that's never going to work.""ABRAMS: ""OK, this time I've got The Iron Lady""BURK: ""I've got 50 Shades of Grey. Hmm tempting, but not really our target audience. Again I think""ABRAMS: ""OK, I've got Room.""BURK: ""Huh.. I've got Independence Day. Let's go again""Abrams pauses and stares at the Cloverfield poster above his desk.ABRAMS: ""No, wait a minute Bryan.. I have an idea""Since much of the joy of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is in not knowing where the story will lead, this review will be spoiler free.The film certainly grabs the attention from the get go, with some of the most dramatic opening titles ever. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (""A Good Day to Die Hard"") plays Rebecca who after a car crash wakes to find herself in a cell room of an underground bunker, accompanied by unstable and unpredictable disaster-nut Howard (John Goodman) and his builder friend Emmett (John Gallagher Jnr). The bunker is stocked with many year's worth of provisions, to outstay the natural disaster that Howard claims is raging above them.Is there really anything happening? And are Rebecca's fears about Howard's true intentions towards her founded?I entered this film with high expectations, and for most of the running time I was not disappointed. The early scenes play out like a claustrophobic and tense three-hander stage play: a bit like the Hateful 8, but without as much gratuitous violence. Whilst there are also similarities here to another of Abram's properties – series 2 of ""Lost"" – the set up in Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken's story is both ingenious and innovative. But (as happened in the equally innovative ""Looper"" from 2012) the clever build-up is wasted on a frankly ridiculous and unnecessary ending. There were many better ways that this story could have been wrapped up, but the writers didn't choose any of them.John Goodman – a highly underrated actor – delivers a chilling performance as the troubled Howard. Mary Elizabeth Winstead received mixed reviews in this household: my wife found her acting overly mannered and distracting, whereas I came away with the opinion that she was quite a find, and this could be a breakout movie for her. Time will tell. For fans of the UK TV's ""Pointless"", the film is also a good 'pointless answer' for a 'Bradley Cooper film': he plays (vocally) Rebecca's estranged husband Ben.New to me as a film composer is Bear McCreary, who turns in a highly appropriate and tense score to complement the action, spiced up by some much needed and well-chosen jukebox hits.The first-time director is Dan Trachtenberg, and he nearly has a classic on his hands. What a shame. I was four and a half to five 'Fads' for the first half of the film, but the ending left me annoyed and frustrated at a great opportunity missed.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

"""10 Cloverfield Lane"": Have we been set up?","""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is Producer J.J. Abrams shrouded in secrecy sequel to the 2008 surprise found footage hit ""Cloverfield"". Sort of.Without completely surrendering the premise, there are thematic elements from the original which come to prominence in this amply anticipated follow-up widely released this weekend (3/11/16). But certainly not to the overarching degree that these aspects factored intrinsically into it's predecessor.John Goodman is a particularly peculiar survivalist/conspiracy theorist (like there's any other kind?) who takes Mary Elizabeth Winstead into his farmhouse bunker for ""safekeeping"" in the wake of a violent car crash. John Gallagher Jr. is already a tenant of this cozy cum creepy underground community.Goodman is, as per usual, his reliable character actor self as Howard, a guy whom you never really know both if you can accept what he's saying as gospel (he claims the world above the trio has succumbed to a catastrophic chemical assault) or what in the living hell he may do next.Winstead has emerged as a personal favorite of mine. Her role as Michelle is one of a super sci-fi action hero here. It is a distinctly distant departure from previous impressive roles in substantially smaller scale productions including ""Smashed"" and ""Alex of Venice"". Winstead proves in resounding fashion to be more than up to the formidable demands of this heretofore unexplored province of performance. Still, despite a couple of moving moments, it is decidedly disappointing that more of her considerable acting acumen was not on display in this story.""10 Cloverfield Lane"" dutifully delivers it's fair share of twists and turns, scares and surprises and jumps and jolts to be sure. But in the end it couldn't help but feel as one long lead-up to a tacked on departure point for the next installment in the series. And I think that we as faithful fans expected and deserved just a little bit more than that.Wouldn't you agree, J.J.?",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One almighty anticlimax,"I can't help but feel disappointed with '10 Cloverfield Lane'. Despite being glued to the screen for the vast majority of the film, I almost feel like I've been conned. The ending just didn't come close to what I was expecting. An hour and a half of tension and drama, and for what? One almighty anticlimax that felt like it had been given next to no thought or preparation.In terms of building up tension, the film is good. Despite the fact that almost all of the movie is set in a bunker with only 3 characters, it never felt in danger of becoming boring. Having said that, I wanted an ending that did the rest of the film justice. Instead I got 10 minutes of what felt like a cop out.I can't say that I didn't enjoy '10 Cloverfield Lane', because for the most part I did, but my disappointment as the mystery unraveled ruined the film for me.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""I'm sorry, but no one is looking for you.""","After a bitter fight with her fiancé, Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) packs a bag and rushes off in her car. When her vehicle is suddenly hit and veers off the road, she loses consciousness only to awake a short time later chained to a wall in a desolate concrete room. Her captor introduces himself as Howard (John Goodman) and informs the petrified young girl that he has not kidnapped her, but actually saved her life from a devastating attack by foreign forces that has made the outside world no longer habitable. As Michelle is slowly allowed to explore the fallout bunker that is now her home, she begins to suspect that Howard has not been truthful about their situation or his intentions.The music really sets the tone for this peculiar little thriller. Seemingly innocuous events are immediately ominous when Bear McCreary's sensationally skin-crawling notes begin plucking at nerves. And it leads to a forceful, shocking title sequence, unmasking the ""Cloverfield"" name as well as a subtle reference to ""10 Rillington Place,"" an obscure British crime drama based on an actual serial killer.But therein lies the problem with ""10 Cloverfield Lane."" It's quite obviously two separate pictures: an unnerving cat-and-mouse game in a claustrophobic, perpetually suspicious, downright scary environment - and producer J.J. Abrams' independent influence on what was clearly a straightforward (but not without twisty moments of surprise), reality-based mystery. Had the two concepts been integrated proportionally, or perhaps if the traumatic revelations appeared in a different order, the fusion of incompatible elements could have been acceptable - or even uncommonly creative. Instead, audiences will be left with a feeling of incongruous projects getting warped together, solely to capitalize on the name recognition of the title to boost the viewership of what was, all by itself, a completely competent thriller.""I'm sorry, but no one is looking for you."" It may look like a simple premise, but this three-person show is a nicely deceitful, wily character study and chilling adventure. Goodman is perfectly creepy as the abductor, who induces unwavering apprehension while harboring just a hint of neighborly concern (or perverse familial preservation). When his deceptively good intentions lean toward something along the lines of Stockholm syndrome-grooming, Winstead (and John Gallagher Jr. in a convincing turn) takes the spotlight as a proactive fighter resourcefully scrounging for clues or defense. Peppered with small bouts of comedy to calm audiences just long enough to rattle them with the next affright, the pacing is keen and the abundance of unknowns keeps things entertainingly agitating. The cinematography is also well used to cheat the visibility of dangers just offscreen. But by the end, despite successfully jangling nerves and generating roller-coaster horrors, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" can't escape the sense that an enormously unrelated story has been repurposed for the sake of marketability.The Massie Twins",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Even on the third viewing, it's impressively gripping","Each time I've seen this -- initially in the theater, then twice via streaming -- I've found it amazingly well made and irresistibly gripping, even though I now know what's coming.The script is brilliant, without a wasted word. The pacing is marvelous -- at times rapid and economical, at other times slowly building suspense. The shifts in tone work perfectly too; the film is sometimes ominous or scary, sometimes thrillingly action-packed, with occasional moments of comic relief (e.g., Goodman with an ice cream cone, Goodman half dancing to rock music, etc.).The acting is superb on the part of all three principals. Goodman, who's an asset in every movie, is truly outstanding here and deserved an Oscar nomination. (I was also pleased to see, however briefly, Suzanne Cryer, so memorable in ""Silicon Valley."")",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Utterly nerve-jangling when it's not busy trying to shoe-horn in a link to Cloverfield,"Apart from the rather cryptic title, there seems to be little connecting Dan Trachteberg's feature debut 10 Cloverfield Lane with J.J. Abrams and his Bad Robot Productions' relatively well-received shaky-cam monster movie Cloverfield from eight years ago. Starting life as a claustrophobic thriller penned by Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken called The Cellar, Abrams claims to have noticed thematic similarities between the two during pre-production and decided to work the story into the Cloverfield universe, offering the odd wink or nod here and there along with the occasional hint at the state of the outside world following the arrival of the bandy-limbed kaiju and its pesky offspring.Any fans of the first film looking for more of the same will be sorely disappointed, but surely captivated nonetheless at the gripping events that unfold here. The film begins almost dialogue- free with our heroine Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) packing up and leaving her apologetic partner (voiced by Bradley Cooper) for some unexplained yet irrelevant reason. After she is hit by what seems to be another vehicle whilst driving in the darkness, she wakes up chained to a wall and hooked up to a I.V. drip in a dingy cellar. She soon meets her captor in the hulking, intimidating Howard (John Goodman), who slides her some food and expects a thank you in return.Eventually her shackles are loosened and she is informed that she was rescued when the country, or possibly the world, was hit by an attack from an unknown source. Howard lists everything from al-Qaeda to alien invaders as the possible culprit. Yet while everyone was laughing at the ex-Navy man's conspiracy theories and paranoia, he was preparing for such an event by building an all-singing, all- dancing bunker equipped with electricity, an air filtration system, movies, board games, puzzles, and all manners of activities designed to pass the time during a long stretch waiting for the air outside to clear. The bunker has another resident, the upbeat Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), who confirms Howard's claims of the apocalypse but shares Michelle's concern for his unpredictable behaviour.There's plenty of fun to be had with trying to decipher Howard's intentions and figuring out just what the hell has happened outside the extremely secure door. The presence of two dead pigs visible from the window seems to concur with Howard's speculations of a gas attack, but what is with the frequent rumblings heard overhead? You'll also be chewing your fingers down the bone, as Trachtenberg forges an almost suffocating atmosphere from what is a pretty standard cinematic setting, with Goodman delivering the finest performance of his career. He is clearly unstable with a social ineptitude, but there is sympathy to be had when we learn of his tragic backstory. Clues to his character are given with an extreme subtlety, with an uncomfortable game of charades in particular offering suggestions that there may be a whole lot more going on than first imagined.Winstead too, is very good, and its a wonder why her career has hit a bit of a slump of late. Michelle isn't just a pretty damsel in distress, but a strong, intelligent young woman with a crafty side of her own. With one eye permanently on the door and the other locked in suspicion at her apparent saviour, her desire to see what happened for herself offers many moments of nerve-jangling tension. Where 10 Cloverfield Lane doesn't really convince is when it's working that eye-catching word into its title. For anyone unaware of the Matt Reeves' 2008 film or those so completely caught up in the main story that it has just slipped their mind, the climax may be too much of a shift in tone. While its likely to cause the movie to linger in your mind for slightly longer than it would have if it had remained a stand-alone drama, it seems rather pointlessly shoe- horned in. But don't let that put you off, as for 90 minutes at least, 10 Cloverfield Lane is outstanding performances from a talented cast and riveting drama that occasionally weaves into horror territory.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great suspense keeping you on your toes,"I saw The Shining the day after seeing this for the first time. Of the two, this horrified me ridiculously more. The biggest reason for this is that the entire movie feels grounded and has characters that you want to root for. This movie takes place in a small bunker so you're constantly learning about the characters which is the most important thing in a movie. John Goodman completely steals the show with an intimidating bipolar performance. What made this movie work for me, is that his character wasn't just some creeper in a room, but a developed person who made sense being where he was and why. As it is a spin off of Cloverfield, you know the monsters are real BUT this movie adds on more wrinkles to keep you guessing throughout. The ending may mot work for some people, however, after all the build up it felt earned and worked for me. There is also a good sense of irony which adds to the humour making this transcend the ""horror"" genre. From the camera work to music to performances, this movie succeeded at building up a world of suspense.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
10 Cloverfield Lane (7/10),"Not often has there been a sequel with such a difference in characters, plot, and filmmaking such as Cloverfields'. Certainly almost everyone watching the movie knows a monster awaits outside besides the lead character Michelle. She faces a different monster, one that has taken custody of her and keeps her as company in his apocalyptic safe rooms. John Goodman plays his part perfectly as an insane doomsdayer and Mary Elizabeth Winstead did a great job as the lead actress as well. The film is very dialogue driven and accounts for a tug-of-war of feelings on what safety really is in this case. 10 Cloverfield Lane is an intense psychological roller coaster that builds up to the final scenes. There were some aspects of the ending film that was disappointing but will be left unsaid for spoiler purposes. Solid unconventional sequel!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Mind blowing, heart pounding, White knuckle Ride","I'm a film snob, and admit I didn't expect much from this after being so disappointed in it's predecessor. I couldn't have been more wrong.Easily, this is the best psychological thriller to come along in in years. John Goodman is a absolute genius, and his performance rivals even the most iconic ones in modern cinema. I am not typically reactive to films, given that I've seen the goriest of the gory and am resistant to the shock scare tactic that lesser films leverage to make you jump.That didn't happen here. This film leveraged your emotions.This film gave me anxiety, it had me literally nervous. Very rarely does a film come along with such a great concept that it leaves the viewer incapable of predicting the results or consequences, but this hit the mark on every single level. It entertained, provoked a reaction, and had me completely invested from beginning to end.THIS is what filmmaking is about. This shows that Hollywood is still capable of original concepts and clever stories rather than just recycling comic book superheroes over and over again. In a better world, John Goodman would get an Oscar for his gripping performance because there hasn't been anyone come close to the talent he demonstrated throughout. Never boring, always unfolding, this was simply masterful cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Good Movie that Takes a Decidedly Wrong Turn,"It's difficult to write a review of ""10 Cloverfield Lane,"" because it seems to successfully achieve what it sets out to for the audience, yet it is ultimately very disappointing in the end. It establishes a great premise from the start as, its primary character--Michelle--is involved in a horrific car accident after leaving her boyfriend. She awakens inside the underground bunker of a recluse--John Goodman--who tells her the outside air has been polluted in some sort of attack and that life as they knew it is over. He also informs her that he saved her from certain death by bringing her into his bunker. A neighbor of the Goodman character is also a resident of the bunker and buys into Goodman's story completely. Michelle does not initially believe any of the story and tension is established from the start. Is the recluse crazy or is he absolutely correct? The film then takes the audience on a roller coaster emotional ride through some twists which significantly alter the tone. The claustrophobic circumstances are well-developed in the film and we feel like we're trapped in that bunker with the characters. The acting is also relatively strong and believable. The problem is that the film takes a cliché turn as the writers and director seem to mail it in for the last 15 minutes. As an audience, we tend to remember where films leave us at the end and take that with us for a while. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" takes the audience on a fun ride for most of its run only to leave us at the curb at the very end. It's not a bad film overall, but it could have easily been so much better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This is not Cloverfield 2,"The key to liking this film is to understand what you're watching. I did not go into this theater expecting a direct sequel to the original Cloverfield, just like I didn't watch Prometheus expecting an Alien prequel. You have to take it for what it is. When J.J. says that it's a ""blood cousin"" of Cloverfield, I interpreted that as meaning it's a part of a shared universe, or something along those lines; and that's really the best approach in my opinion to have.One of the best things about this film is the trailer. It gives you nothing, and at the same time sucks you in. It sets up a mood instead of spoiling any scenes. During the trailer there is not dialogue, on the song ""I think we're alone now"" playing. It's the perfect song because it starts off on an upbeat; giving you sense of hope for a fun time, then the tone smoothly shifts in the opposite direction. In my opinion, the trailer is as well made as the film is.What really made this film incredible for me was the tension it builds. The biggest key to that tension is John Goodman's portrayal of Howard. I spent the entire film trying to figure out ""Is he insane; is he not insane; or is he a mixture of both?"" I felt bad for him, and at the same time I feared him. His outbursts are almost immediately followed by a tender or quiet moment, which really screws with your mind.Both Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. did amazing jobs as well. The chemistry between them is incredible, and because this film has very few characters in it, the character development is equally incredible. You don't quite know where they are going, but you do get an understanding of where they've been, and of what they've been through. Their characters are relatable, and because of that you fear along with them.Thankfully there are very few jump scares. Instead, as I've mentioned above, they rely heavily on the fear of the unknown. The film let's your imagination wander, and when you think you may have started to figure something out they throw you a curve-ball and mess with your mind some more.Go see this film with the understanding that it's NOT A DIRECT Sequel OF ANY KIND to Cloverfield. That needs to be completely out of anyone's head before seeing this because you will be disappointed. If you pay attention you can spot some connections.I've seen it twice now and I loved every second of it both times. In my opinion it's not only a really fun film, it's also a very well made film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Better the 'Monster' you know;),"'10 Cloverfield Lane', serves up the chills, suspense and ultimately the terror.This movie has the eerie feel of that of a classic 'Hitchcock' film. The creepiness is first brought on by the incredible performance of John Goodman (Howard) who, if anyone else, couldn't bring this interesting character to life.John Gallagher Jr. (Emmett) plays a humble and funny farm-hand trying to make the best out of a bad situation, and the beautiful Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Michelle) just happens to be the wrong girl in the wrong place at the wrong time, basically. They both have an interesting dynamic especially when they interact with the mysterious Howard. Winstead is ultimately the audience avatar as the movie progresses.The two younger characters do have a number of tension filled scenes with Howard all the while contemplating just what is happening outside the bunker. All in all, it's Howard's word against there's as they all try to get along and abide by his strict rules. They basically ask the same question the audience will be asking; ""What is going on out there?""Be warned though, the conclusion and answered questions will have viewers divided. Personally, what happens on the outside isn't as scary nor suspenseful as the events which take place with all three characters locked in the bunker.If this is to be compared with 2007's 'Cloverfield', this film surpasses it massively and it gets an extra thumbs up from me just on the count that there is no use of the God-awful 'shaky-cam';)",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The ending transforms this film into an incoherent and unforgivable mess.,"Many movie lovers will leave this film with a dilemma swirling in their mind: can a poorly conceived and poorly directed ending be ignored while you hang on to the memory of the brilliant film that almost was? In cinema, the answer is usually no because we remember a film backwards via the way the story ended. The ending is also the key to how we read a film and how we apply genre codes to make sense of cinematic storytelling. This film traverses three totally different but often compatible genres: the psychological thriller, the horror/gore, and the science fantasy, in that order. Note that the last one is not the same as science fiction, a respectable genre that creatively draws on the logic of science. The film 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) starts brilliantly as a thriller, drops a gear or two as horror, and then has an inexcusable brain-snap as mediocre science fantasy.The linear plot line opens with soon-to-be-married Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) walking out on her fiancé only to drive straight into a horrific car crash. She wakes chained inside a bunker and is held captive by Howard (John Goodman), a doomsday prophet who built the sealed underground structure in anticipation of a major global event. He eventually convinces her that the outside world is now a post-apocalyptic and uninhabitable mess. His neighbour Emmett (John Gallagher) is the only other actor and becomes a confidante for Michelle, but not for long. For the first three- quarters of the film, tension builds then flattens while Michelle becomes accepting of her plight in a claustrophobic space that has all the comforts of home. When Howard's temper shifts into horror and gore mode, Michelle takes flight only to stumble into a B-grade science fantasy created with last century computer graphics. Everything this film achieves in terms of emotional tension, doubt, confusion, and of course, unbridled feargoes up in a puff a smoke.John Goodman's imposing girth, menacing bluster and steely gaze entertainingly convey total terror with enough glimpses of 'Mr nice-guy' to create confusion. For the most part Mary Elizabeth Winstead ably reflects vulnerability, disbelief and fear, although she settles into domesticity rather too easily. The early unfolding story sustains a level of plausibility, even when Howard starts going weird. The real thrill in this film, however, is watching it crash and burn in the last twenty minutes as it runs out of ideas and takes a bad turn in the hope that the applause of science fantasy fans will drown out the boos of thriller fans. But neither group wins as the ending transforms this film into an incoherent and unforgivable mess.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Masterwork Of Suspenseful Filmmaking,"Unpredictable, claustrophobic & making ingenious use of genre elements, 10 Cloverfield Lane is suspenseful filmmaking at its captivating best that establishes & then sustains its mysterious tone & tense atmosphere by always staying one step ahead of the viewers. An increasingly intense, unrelenting & thrilling edge-of-the-seat experience that's led by John Goodman's imposing presence & terrifying performance and keeps its viewers guessing at every turn, Dan Trachtenberg's directorial debut not only delivers as a loose sequel to Cloverfield but is strong & sturdy enough to stand on its own.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Confident feature-debut; Trachtenberg understands Misdirection as a firm tenet for visual horror...,"At the beginning of the movie, our heroine gets involved in a CGI car crash. Those are bad for the makeup. She could have avoided this, but see, she was listening to this guy, Caller ID Ben. He exposits to her how ""they've had a fight, and couples fight."" Yeah Ben, teach her stuff. Because he's giving the worst voice performance since Ahmed Best (Binks J. J.), despite being Bradley Cooper, she'll cut him off. Because the plot doesn't like that at all, he'll redial...She wakes up in Strange Room, Horror Film. We subsequently learn that, in preparation for the synopsis of the movie (chemical attack contaminates air above bunker..), John Goodman built a vast movie set. He equipped it with all the necessary props...food, DVDs, pop songs for montages, chains and handcuffs for Mary Elizabeth Winstead (heroine), etc. That almost got intriguing.The handcuffs are only jewelry; he'll come in, give her the key, she'll try to stab him, he'll let her out of her room, and take the key away. Outside the room, she'll meet a generic middle-aged filler-character, Emmett, wearing a bushy beard. Because he's utterly bland, she'll instinctively trust him, the way you do a mirror. He extends a stabilizing man-hand toward her when she girl-stumbles (cued by Screenwriter's Instructions); ""Keep your hands to your self!"" growls John Goodman. Uh, oh; He Knows Something We Don't.Not that John Goodman is a model bunker-mate either; ""I'd like to watch you pee,"" he informs her, without the clean dialogue. ""I can't with you standing there."" Somebody watched Death Proof. ""This is for my own safety,"" he counters. Oh, all the right retorts. He has the best line in the movie; ""Crazy is building your ark after the flood's already come."" But, by the time he says it, it's too late after the toilet standoff, so the spark of context has long waned from it.""Stay hydrated, and behave,"" sound advice to Winstead. If she'd heeded it, the whole movie would be a loop of the above paragraph, so she misbehaves and tries to........ never mind; like you might have predicted she would, naughty girl.If you're going to trap the audience with a quarter-dozen characters, it's not enough that we just stand them; we need to love to hear their dialogue, to watch dramatic friction between them heat up the room, to love watching them move in space. (Jack Torrance, Danny, Tony, Joy Newsome, Daisy Domergue..) So what characterizations does Dan Trachtenberg accord his actors? Well, Winstead as Michelle (otherwise delightful) has a tendency to sound like a low-battery speech synthesizer...but, this is motivated; she's sedated, so, there's smart writing. She does come with a great fake laugh. That's what a reasonable actress does, upon reading a screenplay with (intentionally) bad humor and MICHELLE LAUGHS written under all the jokes. John Goodman has the uncanny ability to show up....just off-screen so the cam grip can whip-pan to him; ""Boo! I Was Listening The Whole Time."" That's usually the Xenomorph's part, but Goodman'll do.Thinking I was being over-picky, I paid close attention to Goodman in his close-ups and medium shots; he can't keep himself from looking into the lens, The Office-style, twitching close to laughter at the edgeless expository dialogue he's been given. Maybe that's a long-term side effect of all that tasty Coen-brothers' dialogue... Or, maybe he's heard some spoilers about his character; it's both.Because the movie deviates from the Horror Formula, feeding off the personas of Goodman and Winstead (hungry feeding there), it sidesteps a lot of the clichés we'd expect, but it's still cumbered by the ones we could have guessed; Winstead Reminds Goodman of His ""Daughter"" (smiling, a stock memory, in a photo, ...and in a tee-shirt); Emmett Blew His Chance at a Good College (scared of them smart kids!); They All Bond Over A Pop Song Montage; Etc. This stuff is supposed to deepen the characters, give them an existential edge; it just reminds us of the last movie we heard and saw this stuff in.So, what's the film about? ""We'll get attacked by South Korea.."" ""You mean; North Korea.."" ""Is that the crazy one?"" The very best way, like Billy Wilder once instructed us, to tell the audience a truth that'll taste bitter is to make them laugh; you didn't see Paramount emails leaking for this. So while the movie isn't hauling any speciesist or nationalist agendas, it certainly has undertones of rigoristic preparedness and apocalyptic paranoia. It is, after all, a Cloverfield Movie. Does it have anything new to say about what it's about? It doesn't have to; you don't watch Jaws for some fishing lessons.For a guy, using fifteen million dollars to make a Studio Movie that didn't need to be any good, Trachtenberg did no wrongs. Excluding the crash sequence, his movie doesn't contain a single terrible cut, a claim only one in a thousand movies can make. Horror films tend to work toward disorientation through poor mishmash editing and obscure lighting. Trachtenberg goes the other way, using the spare amount of true drama his film has to offer to misdirect our suspicions. He keeps on setting up situations, inherently shaky, and showing the audience he's aware of this by his intelligent choice of resolution. A lot of actual trope subversion happens here, as opposed to trope shout-outs (like Deadpool). Because the film is rooted in unalloyed realism unless it's forced not to, it's extremely terrifying whenever it's forced not to. 7/10 for unadulterated competence. There's a point, when Winstead has to choose between driving to safety, or to a sequel.... I'd have made the same choice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Great movie, garbage ending",There's really not that much to say - the film is really worthwhile and fun to watch. You're constantly questioning yourself and your own sanity - just as the people inside the bunker do. But the comes the ending that feels so alien and isn't something that adds anything add all to the movie. Interestingly this is precisely what happened behind the scenes - the script was done and then the ending was proped onto the story. And you just feel that it doesn't match in the same way the rest of the movie matches. It's really a shame. Still - a good movie. It's just sad that they screwed up the ending so much.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Danger is up and down,This is the first movie I am watching in 2016 and I wish others makes me satisfied like it . first the movie combines two major lines in the story . it is not only about a group of people that go to shelter underground and suffer there from what happens outside but there is also another trouble within keeps you in doubt all over the movie . the casting did a great job in representing their characters especially John Goodman who played the role of very mysterious man who have a history that we want to know and the director gives you small information in every scene about him which counted as a good advantage of the script of the movie . the movie deals with the characters inside and we saw the main character Mary Elizabeth who cant face her problems and that makes her feel bad about herself . this experience learns her to go beyond this and encourage her a lot which take the movie to another level and free her so I was watching a solid written characters with a lot to say without even talking . the music is OK and suitable for anxiety that covers the mode . dialogue is one the best elements of the movie . it delivers what it want simply in a few words . direction also is good and I liked the details made in the shelter and the director concentrate on the particular subject of the movie which sounds comfortable for me . the only thing that bothers me in 10 cloverfield lane was that the last 15 minutes was pretty good and it should continue a little bet to be more convincing and to give an obvious evidence for the danger attacking the country .10 cloverfield lane is interesting movie from the beginning to the end and you will not regret watching it .,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Perfect directorial début and a refreshing narrative.,"So 10 Cloverfield Lane stars John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and John Gallagher Jr. The basic premise is that a woman wakes up in an underground bunker where she is told that a chemical apocalypse has made the air outside toxic. That's all you need to know, that's all you want to know. So, let's get into my review...while sidestepping pretty much everything about it.First of all I have to give props to the director, Dan Trachtenberg; you've not heard of him? That's because this is his first feature film. I mean seriously, I hope this guy goes on to have a long and successful career. 10 Cloverfield Lane does not look cheap or amateur in any way despite only having about a $15,000,000 budget; he really only had three rooms to film in so it made for some really claustrophobic and uncomfortable moments, and even with a limited setting don't be surprised if your heart starts beating a little faster and tense up. As a summary of my introduction to Dan Trachtenberg: I think he's going places.Acting-wise; wow. John Goodman plays 'unstable' exceptionally well; when he's around you're trying to work him out and figure what his deal is and when he wasn't on screen I was just thinking ""Where is he. Where is he"". Mary Elizabeth Winstead is fantastic as well as this woman who suddenly wakes up not knowing where she is or what's going on; but she wasn't some helpless wimp, she had a bit of knowledge which I think made things realistic. John Gallagher Jr. did well in his role as well; I'm not familiar with his work but he did absolutely fine as his character Emmet. So on an acting front I can't really fault it.Now with the plot, I'm not going to spoil anything because I think the less you know before going in then the more you'll enjoy it but if you're hesitant because you haven't seen 2008's found- footage film Cloverfield which has been called ""a blood relative"" or something, don't worry at all; while a connection is plausible 10 Cloverfield Lane is completely stand-alone. The narrative of this movie itself I think is very rare but utilises some familiar imagery which make for a thrilling experience because you do not know what's coming next.As a conclusion, I really enjoyed 10 Cloverfield Lane and it's refreshing to see this sort of originality and an upcoming director.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Tension, shocks and lots of tension, a very good watch.","I've been a little critical of The Cloverfield franchise, particularly the recent offering, The Cloverfield Paradox. However, this film has some serious quality. 10 Cloverfield Lane has intrigue, mystery, surprise, shock, masses of tension and some unexpected sequences. As you watch you start doubting what you're being fed, you wonder if Howard is telling the truth (however crazy it sounds) or if he's a run of the mill psycho. The monster element is used to tremendous effect here, it really works on all levels, especially the shock factor, its presence is woven into the story well, unlike in the Paradox, where it's merely plonked in just because. Excellent performances all round, John Goodman is terrific.A very enjoyable, intriguing movie, with plenty of shocks and surprises, I rate this, 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I was very impressed by this movie!,"I watch a lot of movies. I enjoy most of them. Some of them impress me, and this is one of them.The pacing is good. I was never bored (and I'm willing to put up with some of that). The story is well thought out. I'm hardly ever surprised by a movie; this one is right up there with what M. Night Shyamalan does when he's at his best. I really enjoyed the acting. I'm a John Goodman fan, and keep an eye out for his performances. Mary Winstead is also very talented; I've been a fan since Scott Pilgrim. She turns in a very nice performance here. I wish I was more familiar with John Gallagher Jr. He also performed admirably. The combination of these excellently formed that ""suspension of disbelief"" effect a movie is supposed to have when it's well done. That sense of ""yeah, this could happen in some iteration of our universe"". I highly recommend this movie. It mixes elements of survival (ala Defcon 5), drama involving tough-girl leading ladies (Enough), and movies with sweet plot twists (the Sixth Sense comes to mind). All in all, a fantastic debut effort for Dan Trachtenburg. Hollywood, put this man to work!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I liked it more than Cloverfield,"This movie was better than the first to me. They are both entirely different in their executions anyway. 10 Cloverfield Lane had memorable performances whereas the first did not.

Suspenseful Modern Horror Classic,"'10 Cloverfield Lane' is an intelligent, taut, and suspenseful horror thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout thanks to its brilliant, yet chilling set up, intriguing mystery, and well-constructed nerve-racking tension. The movie acts as a sort of spiritual sequel to the 2008 found footage monster flick 'Cloverfield', where this sequel trades in the massive scope of the first and condenses into a more intimate tale of survival, paranoia and dread, and it's all the better for it.The Plot = After getting into a car crash a young woman named Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) awakens to find herself in a mysterious bunker with two men Howard (John Goodman) and Emmett (John Gallagher Jr). Howard tells her that the outside world is under attack by aliens and that she can't leave due to the chemical poisons in the air, but are the men telling her the truth?First and foremost, you don't need to see the first 'Cloverfield' movie to fully understand what's going on here as this a more standalone feature with only a few minor hints connecting it to the first one. Even though the film studios basically just tacked the Cloverfield name to it, it's still a brilliant psychological horror flick and you could call it a spin-off more than an actual follow-up. The movie features a great ensemble cast of interesting characters and sharp filmmaking and a clever script that makes the most of its claustrophobic setting that makes this one of the best horror movies of the 2010's decade. The constant twists and turns that this flick takes keeps you invested throughout as you're constantly guessing what's really going on in the outside world aims to unsettle you through its creeping realization that something's not quite right here.Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives a fantastic turn as the lead heroine, resourceful, smart, and likeable, she more than holds her own here with her compelling character. John Goodman gives a phenomenal performance as Howard he's a sinister and unpredictable force of nature, and he nails every aspect of his role and delivers one of the finest performances of his career. John Gallagher Jr gives a strong and likeable performance as Emmett and shares fantastic chemistry with the other 2 characters.Overall '10 Cloverfield Lane' is an excellent horror thriller and if it wasn't for the finale I would have given it a 10/10, but it's still a slick horror flick with an interesting narrative and solid direction that makes this a firm classic of modern horror.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Gripping thriller,"What does this have to do with Cloverfield? There's only a small easter egg to tie the franchise together and it feels desperate and manipulative. As a film by itself, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a gripping thriller where we are not always sure what is going on or who to trust. It feels like a very paranoid situation and this really comes across. However, the ending answered the questions too explicitly and devolved into an action scene from War of the Worlds (2005) which was a totally daft tonal shift.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Good Suspense-Thriller Weakened By An Unnecessary Sci-Fi Turn At The End,"For the most part, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a very good thriller, very suspenseful and certainly manages to keep the viewers on the edge of their seat. From the start you're not entirely sure what's happening, and the scenes in the bunker are almost surreal in the way they move from menacing to sheer domestic. The atmosphere in the bunker was superb, and fit the genre of the movie perfectly, and director Dan Trachtenberg used it well. The highlight of the movie for me was John Goodman. I confess that I'm not really a big fan of Goodman, but I'd be prepared to say that this may have been the best performance I've seen him give. As Howard, he can be both scary and charming, and there's mystery about him. From the very start you don't really know if he's a good guy or a bad guy; if he's telling the truth or lying through his teeth.The movie begins with a car accident. Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is leaving her boyfriend and gets into a bad accident. When she awakens she's chained to the wall in a room, apparently a prisoner of Howard. But is she a prisoner? Howard tells her that there's been some type of attack (nuclear or chemical) and that he found her and brought her into the bunker to save her life, because the air outside is unbreathable. Is that true? We wonder for a while, but there seems to be enough supporting his story to make us believe him. There's a second prisoner or guest - Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr.) about whom we learn very little. How did he get there? We're not sure. Howard, Emmett and Michelle seem to settle in for the long haul, convinced that they can't get out. Howard is a bit unbalanced, and you get the impression that you can never really be sure how he's going to react to things. He clearly was a prepper - believing that something like this was going to happen, and maybe a little bit shocked that it actually did. Emmett and Michelle wonder about escaping - but escaping to where? Is there anything left outside the bunker? Could they survive if they left?It's very suspenseful, and then as far as I was concerned it was ruined by the ending, which turned into some sort of alien/sci-fi sort of film. I knew that as always a possibility, but I was hoping that the movie would take a different direction. It was working quite well for me just as the mystery of Howard and the bunker, which the confined atmosphere creating more than enough suspense. I didn't really need aliens. Somehow, for me, that took away from what had been making the movie work so well.Supposedly this is described as a ""spiritual successor"" to the 2008 film ""Cloverfield."" Maybe - but you don't need to have seen ""Cloverfield"" for this to make sense. I wouldn't call it a sequel in the normal use of the term and I can't really say that anything in this really made me think about ""Cloverfield."" It's capable of standing on its own. It's a taut little suspense/thriller with an ending that could have been better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Dan Trachtenberg, You Rock!","If you are a fan of tension-filled films that thrills through the uncertainty around its premise & characters, 10 Cloverfield Lane is heaven sent. Dan Trachtenberg's first feature film is completely engrossing, as its unpredictability keeps you frantic throughout its entire runtime. The conflict is as well tangible that elevates the suspense to a whole new level. And with an outstanding cast nailing their roles, this sleeper is guaranteed to surpass expectations.The film's question marks are centered on John Goodman's character and WOW is his performance praise worthy. One can never guarantee his character's state of mind as he successfully portrays insanity in one frame but is rational in the next. He then conveys the necessary fright & uneasiness that keeps the rest of the characters & the audience on edge, anticipating his actions & reactions. Happily, Mary Elizabeth Winstead meets John's horror head on. Her refusal to become a victim & her resemblance as a force to be reckoned with makes it a breeze to root for her character. Thank God the film veers away from the usual idiotic heroine, as the continuous distrust & conflict between the two was pure entertainment.The pace of the film is another highlight necessary to point out. Despite the claustrophobic setting, the fantastic direction & screenplay never lets up on excitement, as realistic problems, moments of respite & well timed revelations captivate. There was never a dull moment as the suspense elevates with every act, until the finale that is both jaw dropping & worthy.To cap of my review, there is absolute glee in stating that the Cloverfield franchise remains in full form with this 2016 gem. The scale may be smaller compared to its predecessor, but the suspense and thrill generated from the mystery the film fondly plays around with, is simply laudable. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a must see. 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Suspenseful premise with an unavoidable anti-climax,"A clever premise is handled quite effectively and thoughtfully by first-time director Dan Trachtenberg in this nominal follow-up to 2008's Cloverfield. Apart from J. J. Abrams name in the producer's list, the films have precious little in common, however; not even the home-video approach, which would have done this film no favours. Instead, 10 Cloverfield Lane opens with a chilling mystery which may or may not be what it looks like: A young recently broken-up girl is pushed off the road by a driver and wakes up bruised, tied-up and attached to professional medical equipment in what seems like a bomb shelter. Her saviour/captor, played with true emphasis by John Goodman, appears to ensure her that she - and his other ""guest"" named Emmett - are safe with him in his shelter while the world outside is under attack by an unknown force.Clever thriller premises have ended up as god-awful films enough times for seasoned viewers not to get over-excited by the promising opening of this film, but once the vibrant interplay between our three main characters gets going and director Trachtenberg reveals just enough without jeopardizing the logic of his story, 10 Cloverfield Lane finds its feet and becomes unusually effective for this genre. The effectiveness is not down to any one brilliant piece of writing or filmmaking, but is rather accomplished through fine handling of well-executed rehashings of several previously seen elements. The film draws inspiration from a wide range of films, from Misery to Take Shelter, and adds a dash of classic sci-fi here and zombie-ish threats there to keep us on our toes. The real horror, though, like so many times before, is the human side of it, accomplished not least through great acting from all three leads. Which is why there is an unavoidable anti-climax when the film is obliged to take us out of the ""comfort zone"" of the bunker and into the highly well-known unknown, from which the producers unmistakenly insists there must be a possible financial way further.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Monsters come in many forms,"10 Cloverfield Lane is a 2016 science fiction horror thriller about a woman who after a car crash wakes up in an underground bunker with two men who insist the earth is no longer habitable.I thought this was an interesting movie that really kept things intriguing with the mystery surrounded by what happened and what's going on outside the bunker. The small intimate setting was claustrophobic and unsettling as we watch these characters try to live as if there is nothing abnormal going on.

Pretty Good Claustrophobic Horror,"There were a few plot twists here and there that surprised me and felt like a B-Movie version of Lovecraftian horror (at the end) and the rest of the movie being entrapped psychological horror. It's quite good if you find my description enticing but if you don't like psychological horror or thriller you'll hate this film.10 Cloverfield Lane is a better film than Cloverfield from a purely technical, horror and academic review of the film. However by my own mind, Cloverfield (2008) is a far more entertaining film because of how unique it's method of capture was and the monster element within it. I had a big problem with the antagonist(s) I won't tell you how many antagonists there are or it may be considered a spoiler in 10 Cloverfield Lane. The design of the antagonist is my main problem with the film versus it's predecessor. We follow our protagonist Michelle as she lives through a short tumultuous relationship with a crazed psychopath named Howard and a redneck nobody named Emmett.Overall I'll give it a 8/10 despite its flaws; for the low budget and it's unexpected and sudden release 10 Cloverfield Lane deserves credit for actually being quite a unique film I haven't seen before. Trust me you should give this a try, it's not for everyone but even as someone who hates these types of films I still had a half decent time with it. Especially because the female protagonist reminded me of a more sexy just as competent Sigourney Weaver hero so that's an instant point in my book albeit the movie has a far less menacing monster.P. S. The ending of the film was exactly what happened like 2/3rds of the way through War of the World kinda unervy, wonder if they stole that idea from there. I'm mentioning that fact because I watched War of the Worlds a week before seeing 10 Cloverfield Lane. Sorry not part of the rest of my review just thought I would add that in just in case someone saw the similarity as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great multiple plot lines.,"The possible plot lines are varied from the start. They continue in multiple possibilities for almost the whole movie. Some new ones popping up. Which is surprising considering the cramped quarters. You never get any extra clues from jumping into another character's point of view. The very few clues, are only observed from the one character.I really like the way it very casually connects to Clovefield. It would be interesting to see some other stories try and connect to that. Cloverfield left an abundance of loose ends. Seems ripe for others to link into it. Could be a lot of fun to see independent stories build on that original mystery.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
amazing,"10 Cloverfield Lane, a psychological thriller shrouded in mystery, secures a solid 7/10 in my cinematic repertoire-a testament to its claustrophobic tension and standout performances. Mary Elizabeth Winstead's portrayal of Michelle is a tour de force in resilience, adding layers to the gripping narrative. The film's strength lies in its tight editing, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats as they navigate the labyrinth of the unknown. While the confined setting serves as a strength, it also introduces a slight weakness in terms of pacing when compared to the explosive climax. The musical score, a haunting melody echoing the unease, complements the chilling atmosphere without overshadowing the suspense. Cinematography captures the confined space with a palpable sense of dread, adding a visual layer to the psychological warfare at play. 10 Cloverfield Lane, with its enigmatic storyline and nail-biting tension, emerges as a captivating thriller that lingers in the shadows of uncertainty.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Smart and original,"It is not easy to make a film with only three characters, enclosed in a bunker below ground and not to be boring. 10 Cloverfield Lane (I would rename it 10 Cleverfield Lane...) not only is not boring but, finally, after so many bad movies, it's a very good special one. It has a real gradual tension, until the unexpected but so natural end. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is perfect in the role of Michelle and John Goodman is impeccable. Exceptional the extremely brief appearance of Suzanne Cryer in the role of The Woman. Very persuasive monster and alien ship. Original and smart main titles too.

Saul Goodman,"Looking for inspiration of something to watch, I landed back on alphabetically going through the Sky Movies list and the first one that I hadn't seen since I started reviewing everything was ""10 Cloverfield Lane"". I saw it on it's release back in 2016, though I would say that it still has its moments, it suffers somewhat on a second viewing.Having left her relationship, Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is involved in a traffic accident. She wakes up, chained up in a basement, owned by Howard (Jon Goodman). Howard tells her that there's been an attack on the country, and the air outside their bunker is poisoned. Naturally disbelieving, she's a little more convinced when she meets Emmett (John Gallagher Jr) who had to convince Howard to let him in, when the attack happened. They settle into their new normal, until a discovery casts their saviour in a new light.Despite that link to ""Cloverfield"", the first time you watch the movie it works quite hard to keep you guessing as to whether there is a situation above ground, or whether Howard just wanted a pretty girl chained up in his basement. The second time you see the film, much of that tension is, of course, dissipated as you know what actually is going on. With that knowledge, maybe the film doesn't quite do enough to convince you that there's nothing wrong with Howard. The edge he has never really goes away.There are elements that I still like. The performances from the main three members of the cast are good, and Bradley Cooper makes a small cameo as the voice of Michelle's boyfriend. The sound design is good, as is the score by Bear McCreary. On a second viewing though, it just doesn't feel like it's in service of very much.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Amazing movie!! I was on the edge of my seat,No spoilers here!! :) I highly agree with everyone who has already said do yourself a favour & just go see this movie without knowing anything about it first!You'll be thankful you did.All the actors were excellent. So much tension builds between them. One of the best movies I've seen in a while & it will no doubt stick in my mind for a long time.Soundtrack was excellent too.I'm hoping we don't have to wait 8 years for the next instalment. I liked the ending & I'm very curious to see what will happen next!,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This movie infuriated me - but not for the reasons you might think!,"*Spoilers further ahead so read at your own risk!* I just got out of the cinema after catching the late show of this film on a Saturday night. Now, let me just start off by saying that I have walked out of movies I hated before, sat through movies I hated right until the very end, and movies I absolutely praised to the heavens (I think all of us have been in all of these 3 categories at least once in our lives when it comes to movies).However, a fourth category has now emerged for me and reared its ugly head - and it is perhaps the worst one of them all! When it comes to ""10 Cloverfield Lane"", this was the very first time I've EVER sat through a movie for its near-2 hour running time, in complete tension and suspense, only for the last 30 minutes to come unhinged so abruptly and vapidly.Why were so many plot elements introduced throughout the film if absolutely none (and I mean NONE) of them were addressed? This is the problem with filmmakers nowadays - many of them have the ability and talent to showcase excellent traits of a movie, such as atmosphere or good casting choices (as is the case with this movie. More on that later). But none of them have the ability to tie it all together into a cohesive story. Boring and incomprehensible are two things this movie is NOT, but that still doesn't mask the fact that the filmmaker had no idea where he was going with this, and that's very clear from the outset.Comedy was interspersed throughout the film in little sprinkles, but none of it manifested into anything remotely humorous, given the circumstances. Many films work under the pretense of adding a black comedy component, but it simply doesn't work here.And then we get the absolute worst ending I've ever seen - what were we supposed to take away from this? That our female heroine suddenly has ""combat skills"" and ""medical expertise"" just because she can crawl through a tiny ventilation system and treat a cut with stitches? Is it supposed to be a rush of sudden girl power? GIVE ME A BREAK! The main protagonist wasn't even the least bit likable, which slightly alienated me from the start. What was the point of the subplot having to do with Michelle's husband calling her repeatedly before the events of the film? Or the one about Howard's-daughter-Megan-that-turned-out-not-to-be-his-real-daughter? Or something like that.Do any of these things really matter anyway? Nope, because none of them were addressed! And this is what I'm talking about when I say that there was no semblance of a cohesive story. There wee very trace amounts of character depth or perception illustrated here - just a case of more questions being asked than answered, followed by a hallmark of trite clichés to wrap things up before the culmination of the 103 minute runtime. And then.... aliens????? REALLY???Now, for the one big positive about this film - John Goodman's performance. He didn't fail to impress here, as per usual, but with a script this lackluster not even his overpowering tour-de-force can save this one. I wish that were the case, though.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
All I can say is Watch Goodman's Eyes,"This is one of the most engaging films I have seen in a long time. Unpredictable and something old that is new again. J.J. Abrams I want more...like this. John Goodman is excellent definitely Academy Award Material. Watch Goodman's eyes; Manic in a word. Mary Winstead is one definitely to watch. Perfect for the role. Convincing and engaging. I really felt for her pain and not knowing. John Gallagher is one who reminds me of a young Matthew McConuaughy in his country boy acting ability. Tense startling and spot on. A great suspense piece a small cast that meshes well together. Pacing is excellent; Editing excellent,acting superb, and the directing was unbelievably tense. Scary horrifying I jumped twice, a reminder of the early 60 film horror genre. This film is perfect in every way and will be a milestone of Horror for newer directors to achieve. From the 70's and 80's too much or too little. 10 Cloverfield Lane shows me just enough to scare the hell out of me. See this before it is too late.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Interesting mystery film,"10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) is a film that's very intriguing. I love mysterious movies, ones that make you guess what's gonna happen all the way through. There were moments during the movie where It thought for sure that one thing was definitely true, then there would be times where I thought that something completely different was true. And I really love that, it's thrilling and holds your attention. The writing is smart overall and it does a great job of keeping your interest. The cast does a good job at handling their roles, especially John Goodman. Goodman plays his character with a mystery and certain menace that works very well. And I enjoyed the rest of the actors too. The plot is very interesting because it has multiple aspects to it. On one hand, you're thinking about Goodman and who he really is and if he is a good or bad guy, and then you're also thinking about whether or not the outside world is really dangerous and what is happening. I highly suggest this movie if you like this genre, it really is well made. 8/10 for 10 Cloverfield Lane.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
John Goodman is too creepy,"I liked this movie - but man, Goodman almost did too good a job - he was SO CREEPY!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Could Have Been So Much More...,"This movie shocked everyone when they found out about it... 2 months ago and now it's finally here. Cloverfield (2008) feels like it was yesterday when it hit theaters riding on the back of the found footage film type. Without spoiling the movie, 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) is not a sequel and really feels like it's in the same universe but maybe different galaxies.Right from the get-go, the film holds you in suspense. After the car accident, you are fondled into the claustrophobic bomb shelter with two men who claim the outside world was infected with a widespread chemical attack. But when things go from bad to worse in the bomb shelter. Tensions rise as you begin to finish the jigsaw puzzle of how Michelle got down into the shelter (Reference to the movie). However the ending to me was a let down.Before I begin on the ending, yes I know that opinions are divided. A love it or hate it type ending. The story-line up until this point has been masterwork. Original screenplay and story-line has made you expect something a whole lot more from this tasteless ending. Perhaps the only problem made in this movie was that they tied it to Cloverfield (2008) as the clichés of every action thriller begin to appear. (Wont spoil anything). Everything went well until this point and I feel as though if they took a step in the opposite direction by exploring the roots of specific characters more and maybe even seeing the clover we all know and love from Cloverfield (2008) other than this bland, unoriginal excuse for an antagonist we see in this film.Don't get me wrong, this movie is full of twists and surprises that not all films get right. 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) does get this right. Although a different ending should be apparent instead of a money grabbing ending setting the Cloverfield franchise up for future get-rich-quick type movies from this cult favorite movie. Just like other cult favorites, they have to be treated carefully and I found they did not for this film's ending.Thanks",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Trust,"Knocked unconscious in an automobile accident, a young woman wakes up in an underground bunker and has to determine whether or not her male companions are telling the truth about a nuclear apocalypse above ground in this unsettling thriller starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Tension hangs well in the air throughout with John Goodman turning in a fine, deliberately ambiguous performances as the chief captor/rescuer who may or may not have lured another young woman down to the bunker before. The bunker itself is also a magnificent feat of art direction as it often looks more like a comfortable den than a traditional fallout shelter (there is a worthwhile brief documentary on the DVD about the bunker's meticulous construction). While the first hour and a quarter of the film is captivating stuff with eerie sound effects and sporadic power failures, the film runs at least twenty minutes too long with all ambiguity erased near the end. Well filmed as the final few scenes may well be, they lack the energy that the film manages to otherwise drum up from making us question what is really afoot. The concluding scene admittedly has quite a bit to say about the choices we make under stress, but the denouement here is nevertheless underwhelming for a film that, for the most part, preys upon insecurities among strangers and the difficulty of developing trust. Winstead is very good though, and with films like this and 'Faults', she is proving herself to be quite an actress. The majority of the movie also moves very well for a director making his big screen debut.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
So so good!!!... Until the end,"For the first 90 minutes or so, I was absolutely loving this movie. I went to see it not really knowing what to expect, or even what it was about really, and I was loving it. It had all the right amounts of intensity and scariness, with just enough humor. It was paced well and all the secrets were revealed at appropriate times so that you were never bored, but there were still some moments that weren't as scary. The plot was interesting and intriguing and I was always wanting to find out more. And then came the last 15 minutes. I'm not really sure what happened there. Remember how amazing Lost was until the last season? It was kind of like that. Apparently J.J. Abrams likes to do this to us. It just didn't make sense. I could have easily come up with three or four endings myself that would have fit the movie better and been more entertaining. Still, like Lost, the beginning is just so good that it is easy to overlook the trainwreck that was this movie's ending. All in all, I'd say it was a good movie, even aside from the ending. If it had ended ten minutes earlier, this review would be totally different. So I guess it was pretty good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I still can feel the impact,"This movie is very well executed and recommended to watch. The atmosphere really twists your mood upside down -- unpredictable, creepy, humorous, frightening and shocking. I am not pretty satisfied with the ending, though - however, the whole package was very entertaining and worth your time, it was instead -- really paid off. Should you like to watch movie that makes you curious of the ending, then this one is yours. The actors and actress were amazingly directed to be acting like it's a real issue they are encountering -- the ambiance really affects the audience. A bit of chemical knowledge I got from this movie - a fuel that's able to transform humans to bones, and that's good -- though I hated chemistry so much. LoL.. Don't forget to watch this movie.Best of luck, A",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Intense from beginning to end,"Like everyone else, I was taken by complete surprise when the movie was announced less than two months ago with a trailer and everything. No-one knew it even existed until then, and it's sudden appearance brought on a whole host of questions. The film's ultimate lure was by not telling you anything, and remaining mysterious. That was enough for me to get more excited about this movie than that big blockbuster featuring one of my favourite characters released at the end of the week. Just a note on spoilers, I avoid spoiling anything as best I can, and make efforts to hide anything major, but you are warned that this movie is best enjoyed knowing nothing.10 Cloverfield Lane is a movie that encourages you to constantly question what you see and what you're told. It throws twists and turns at you from all angles, sometimes suddenly, out of the blue, to loud and shocking results. To say that 10 Cloverfield Lane is unpredictable is an understatement. Things just unexpectedly happen from the very offset, and you're never sure what or when something is going to happen next. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and off- balance. For as many questions as it poses, it makes sure all the major ones are answered by the movie's end. However the story's only real fault is with it's climax. Even when knowing about the movie's external context, and taking note of the hints and clues subtly laid out in the build up, the ending still comes off as a bit far-fetched. While it does play as a little ironic, it just feels completely out-of-place with the tone and direction of the rest of the film that precedes it.Being a movie that largely takes place in an underground bunker, it's entertainment value is entirely reliant on the dialogue and the acting work. Thankfully, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a massive success in both regards. Mary Elizabeth Winstead brings her A-game as Michelle. After a car accident, she finds herself chained to the wall of an underground bunker and told that the surface is unsafe due to chemical or nuclear attacks. Winstead plays her suitably suspicious and distrusting. She's even a little manipulative over her cohabiters to ensure she can not only find the truth, but also live to tell the tale. She often holds her suspicions and fears just beneath the surface. John Gallagher Jr. is also pretty good as Emmett, the other, younger guy in the bunker. He's not too sharp, but Gallagher doesn't play him as a complete idiot (you never go full retard). He's a funny guy with a soul and good heart, and his character brings a much needed lightheartedness to the otherwise claustrophobic and grim tone of the rest of the movie.However, even amongst such great performances from his co-stars, John Goodman shines like a shiny diamond. It's easy to forget how good an actor he really is, but 10 Cloverfield Lane is here to remind us. As Howard, the conspiracy nut who built the bunker. With a history in the Navy and working with satellites for a certain Japanese company, it's easy to understand where his conspiracy stance may stem from, and lays the seeds that he might actually be right. Besides, Goodman plays him like an older version of a thirty year-old who lives in his mum's basement. This gives him a creepy and anti-social persona that puts you on edge towards his true intentions. However he injects enough humanity and soul into the performance that Howard is more than just an antagonist. He's sympathetic enough that he could be genuine and just misunderstood. You feel Howard has a full and deep history just from Goodman's performance alone.Oh yeah, almost forgot, what's it's relation to Cloverfield? No idea. At this point with JJ Abrams, it's hard to tell if he's narratively connecting movies together, or just putting the same easter eggs and references into them for fun and to watch the internet explode. There's a strong theory supporting the subtle sequel idea, but there's also a few points that just fly in the face of any outright continuity. Ultimately, you'll just have to see it and judge for yourself, but either way 10 Cloverfield Lane stands perfectly fine by itself without relying on any other movie.I won't rattle on too long (I don't think I could without delving too much into spoiler territory), so I'll leave it there and keep it concise and short. It's a tense thriller that will plunge you into eternal suspense, driven by complex characters and spectacular performances. I give it a very good 8/10 (although subsequent rewatches may well bump it up a bit; it's a movie that begs to be watched more than once).",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
this is turning out to be a good franchise,"The 2008 found footage movie ""Cloverfield"" played with the audience by making you think early on that it was a sort of romantic comedy...before the important stuff started. Now comes ""10 Cloverfield Lane"". This movie plays with the audience even more. The main differences are that it's told in third-person narrative, and that it has recognizable faces. But it keeps you guessing about just what is going on.John Goodman puts on one of the most impressive performances of his career, with fine support from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. As to the question of how much the movie relates to the 2008 movie, I'm eager to see where it goes from here, if in fact they make a third movie.Good one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Stand Alone = 5 As a Sequel = 6,"If you were to watch this movie having not seen the first movie I believe you'd judge it to be an average thriller/horror movie with a quirky ending, nothing more. Having watched the previous movie I thought it was a decent installment!It had some interesting dynamic mystery elements throughout, which was a surprise. The movie somehow managed to get me to question the motives of the detainer, even though its obvious we all know an alien invasion has taken place (if you have seen the first movie).It had a completely different feel from Cloverfield. Telling a completely different story, from a similar time-frame. However, the reason I rated it a 6 is due to the fact that the first Cloverfield was all about Sci-Fi alien ACTION! Up close and personal!! I enjoyed the suspense but only felt the film really got going until the final 15- 20 minutes, which then went on to clearly set up for another installment!I'm very happy about the possibility of another Cloverfield movie coming out in the future, and this has laid more foundations down for the next one.I hope I get to learn more about the attackers!",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Claustrophobic and psychological Sci-Fi thriller,"Science-fiction thriller gets off to a breathtaking start with the world ravaged by a searing holocaust .This horror-thriller film 10 Cloverfield Lanedeals with a young woman (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is held in an underground bunker by a man (John Goodman) who insists that a hostile event has left the surface of the Earth uninhabitable. Monsters come in many forms. Outside is dangerous... inside is terrifying.Nice dystopian film displays thrills , violence , fast-paced , tension and wild images , and despite its closed environment, there is action and thriller enough. This Sci-Fi movie has its moments concerning a trio of survivors living in an underground bunker , while an allegedly exterior threat is continually threatening by means of noise, and strange apparitions . This is an imaginative , Sci-Fi thriller with some excellent moments , even if the storyline is not up to the scale of the tale . It is a kind of follow-up to ¨Cloverfield¨(2008) by Matt Reeves , as they take place in the same universe . However, producer J. J. Abrams has stated that the studio has a scheme to tie the two pictures , as well as possible future sequels in the franchise, together , although to the present date 2023, it has not yet taken place . J J Abrams produces this first feature as director of Dan Trachtenberg , a claustrophobic and tense psychological thriller in which John Goodman stars as Howard , Michelle 's unlikely savior , who claims that the outside is uninhabitable due to an apocalyptic catastrophe and that all people have died, being them the only survivors. There is a third inhabitant of the Emmet bunker played by John Gallagher Jr, a neighbor of Howard who believes he has seen the first signs of the attack that has led to the catastrophe, which could be due to a nuclear conflict, chemical warfare or perhaps an alien invasion. , and who he got into the shelter when Howard was about to lock himself in it. In this film Michelle has to make a thorny decision, determine if she is a hostage or a survivor and if the right thing to do is to stay in the Bunker or try to escape from it and face the supposed terror outside. The trio of protagonists : John Goodman , Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr are pretty good good , giving decent interpretations.The motion picture was competently directed by Dan Trachtenberg , which earned him a Directors Guild of America Award nomination for Outstanding Directing - First-Time Feature Film.

no shade throwing here...,"I'm the impatient kind.First off, i'm from brooklyn and have no time for bull. And i'm old. And i've seen too many movies that didn't explain what was going on after sitting through them.

And one is supposed to wait the entire length of the movie to find out whether or not one's curiosity is to be satisfied. OR, whether or not we've just wasted just that much more time of our lives on something that doesn't pay off in the end.The rest of the movie, aside from the ending, is damn good.

J.J. Abrams and his Magic Box,"In March of 2007, J.J. Abrams took to the TED Talk stage and spoke to a captive audience about his creative process. He equated his storytelling techniques to an old magic box he bought when he was a kid. ""You look a Star Wars...you don't know who that mysterious woman is; mystery box...you open up the message in the droid, she wants to find Obi-Wan Kenobi, but who is that; mystery box."" Inside those boxes are endless possibilities that keep the viewer in suspense until that magical moment the box is finally opened. 10 Cloverfield Lane is that aesthetic philosophy put into practice by incredibly talented people both behind and in front of the camera.10 Cloverfield Lane starts with Michelle (Winstead) packing up her belongings and driving to parts unknown. In the dead of night, Michelle is run off the road and wakes up in a windowless room, attached to a I.V. drip and handcuffed to a pipe. In comes Howard (Goodman), a lumbering, menacing older man who calmly informs her there has been a nationwide attack of some kind. Luckily she was saved in the nick of time by Howard who had his underground bunker built years prior. Naturally, Michelle is suspicious and looks to escape, yet after fellow cohabitant Emmett (Gallagher) confirms Howard's doomsday tale, she must decide whether she's safer in the bunker or outside.Is this film meant to be a sequel to Cloverfield (2008) the popular found-footage film that made J.J. Abrams a household name? If so, instead of making the sequel bigger, louder and dumber than its predecessor, the film is a tiny, smartly done chamber piece that masterfully plays on the audiences' expectations. This movie is fierce giving the internal and external threats to Michelle's well- being constantly in the minds of the viewers, all while giving us a mystery of sorts to solve.Much of the credit must be given to the three fine actors who take up the entire movie. Winstead is wonderful as our resourceful and instinctual heroine. As the stakes are inevitably raised higher and higher, she resists succumbing to Bad Decision Syndrome (BDS) and stays ahead of the audience in new and creative ways. Gallagher stumbles a bit when accentuating the balance between southern good 'ol boy and cautious gentleman. Yet his character proves endearing as he breaks the tension between Michelle and Howard on several occasions. If there's one person proving to be the true standout however, it's John Goodman.Part of the mystery surrounding 10 Cloverfield Lane is Howard's true temperament and intentions. One minute the man is calm, even friendly to his fellow house guests; other moments he explodes with furious anger without much provocation. Howard can be seen by some as a surrogate or a mouthpiece to anti-society types who prep for the coming apocalypse and would take great relish in saying ""I told you so."" Yet because this kind of attitude largely exists in the fringes, Howard; either through nature or nurture, cannot cope with other human beings. It is revealed early on that Howard brought Michelle to the bunker but if his story is to be believed, for what reason did he bring her? I have my own theory which would explain Howard's natural antagonism towards Emmett. Ironic that a man so dedicated to saving his own life has completely lost his humanity.Unfortunately, the ""practical"" purpose for bringing Michelle to the bunker is largely left unexplored which likely helped the film keep it's PG-13 rating but does it no favors either. The film has other faults including tipping its hand too early when it comes to whether the nationwide attack was real or a figment of Howard's imagination. There's also a third act reveal that seems to resolve itself far too quickly. Yet under novice director Dan Trachtenberg's confident vision and the watchful eye of producers J.J. Abrams, Drew Goddard and Matt Reeves et al. this creepy little film has enough Hitchcockian suspense to stem any oversights.Despite largely taking place in a single multi-roomed bunker, 10 Cloverfield Lane feels like a high quality B-horror film with some surprising twists and turns. The characters are strong and interesting and the events are all generated naturally from the decisions of the characters and not some cockamamie high-concept conceit. It's interesting that an intimate movie like this can be spun-off of a larger than life found footage film monster movie. I guess sometimes the greatest mysteries can come from the smallest packages.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Short review and no spoilers.,"This movie started with a preliminary title called The Cellar and it would've been a fantastic name for the film.It's dark, creepy, bordering on claustrophobic where every moment keeps you in a state of near tension as to what is going to happen next.I cannot state how impressive John Goodman is in this film. His acting range is beyond that of almost any I can think of at the moment. He is absolutely captivating every time he's on film and every time you begin to think you understand his motivations, you're wrong.Mary Elizabeth Winstead is excellent in her role. She in a tough position as the protagonist and needs to carry herself against the dominating presence of Goodman. She is capable and adapts well as her situation changes.John Gallagher Jr. is just plain likable. He's a good foil for the other actors and it's a chance for him to expand his name recognition.As for the film itself, I'm going to be deliberately vague as I don't want to spoil anything. The movie keeps the tension level up without fail and the minutes fly by. I recommend trying to know as little as possible before going in to seeing the film as the twists are a necessary part of the drama.Overall, the film is highly recommended.

Subterranean Tensions Rise: '10 Cloverfield Lane' Weaves Claustrophobia with Mesmerizing Performances,"""10 Cloverfield Lane"" emerges as a film that defies the shackles of its genre, much like a butterfly breaking free from its chrysalis. It is a cinematic journey that begins with the familiar-a young woman, Michelle, played with a compelling mixture of vulnerability and strength by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, finds herself in a car accident only to wake in a bunker. John Goodman's Howard is the architect of this subterranean sanctuary, a man whose layers are as complex as the bunker's supposed protection from an apocalyptic outside world.The film, directed by Dan Trachtenberg, is a masterclass in suspense, weaving tension into the fabric of its narrative with the skill of a seasoned tailor. The bunker becomes a character in itself, its walls echoing with the sounds of safety and danger in equal measure. The claustrophobic setting is a fertile ground for psychological drama, and the script capitalizes on this with aplomb. The dialogue crackles with intensity, and the interactions between Michelle and Howard are a dance of trust and mistrust.Goodman delivers a performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing. He embodies Howard with a presence that is at once comforting and terrifying. Winstead matches him beat for beat, her portrayal of Michelle a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. The chemistry between the characters is electric, their shared scenes a taut wire of emotions.The narrative is a labyrinth, each turn revealing a new facet of the story, a new depth to the characters. It is a film that respects the intelligence of its audience, never spoon-feeding but rather inviting viewers to piece together the puzzle. The pacing is deliberate, each scene meticulously crafted to build towards a crescendo that is both satisfying and thought-provoking.At times, the narrative's twists border on the implausible, straining the credulity of the audience. The connection to the larger ""Cloverfield"" universe feels tenuous, a thread that is perhaps too thin to hold the weight of expectation. The final act, while explosive, seems at odds with the intimate suspense that precedes it, a departure into a different genre that may leave some viewers feeling jarred.""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a film that stays with you, its echoes lingering in the mind long after the credits have rolled. It is a reminder that in the realm of storytelling, the most potent tales are often those that are rooted in the human experience - our fears, our hopes, and the lengths to which we will go to protect them.""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a testament to the power of narrative, a film that enthralls and entertains, even as it invites reflection.

Do yourself a favour and see 10 Cloverfield Lane,"When 10 Cloverfield Lane was announced a few months ago, I had the same reaction that everybody else did: what the hell is this and how have I not heard about it before?When rumours broke that it was just a regular movie that was slapped with the Cloverfield brand in post production for marketing hype, I was less than thrilled. I expected a very cynical cash grab.I am incredibly grateful to have been proved wrong.First things first, this is NOT a sequel to the 2008 Cloverfield. It is a standalone film in its own universe. Like the original, 10 Cloverfield Lane crosses between horror and science fiction, with a very strong psychological thriller element throughout.If you were expecting a direct sequel, complete with the Clover monster and the creepy parasites, I'm afraid you'll be rather disappointed.I admit that it was wrong of Bad Robot to never come out and explain what the film really is. Throwing around terms like ""blood relative"" or ""spiritual successor"" just caused more confusion and imbued a false sense of hope that the original monster would show up at the end.SPOILERS... he does not.However, what you will get instead is a brilliantly crafted film with the perfect tone. It honestly gave me one of the most enjoyable theatre experiences I've had in years.When it's meant to be scary, it's scary. When it's meant to be funny, it's funny. And when it's meant to be balls out crazy, it's balls out crazy. I was smiling the whole way through, loving every second.The performances were terrific. John Gallagher, Jr gave Emmett the right kind of charisma with a genuine thoughtfulness.As I'm sure everyone has heard by now, John Goodman was exceptional. His role as Howard was incredibly gripping, intense and also lighthearted. Walking the fine line between sane and insane, Goodman never faltered and kept the audience guessing who the character really was.The real standout here was Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who channelled Sigourney Weaver in Alien during the entire film. Her ability to show genuine fear, confusion, cleverness and strength made her character instantly likable and relatable.Unfortunately, I'm worried that the title will hurt the film's success. I loved the movie from beginning to end and I'm a fan of the proposed ""Cloverfield anthology series"", but it would have been safer to keep the original working title of ""The Cellar"" to avoid any misunderstanding.From a business perspective, having Cloverfield in the name would generate significant buzz and probably bring in greater box office numbers.However, if word of mouth spreads that it's not ""Cloverfield 2"", angry fans could avoid seeing it out of spite.But I'm imploring you... just because this is not Cloverfield 2 doesn't mean you shouldn't see it. It's a great movie that subverts your predictions, surpasses expectations and never stops being entertaining.Do yourself a favour and see 10 Cloverfield Lane.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Chappy Watched: 10 Cloverfield Lane,"Before even talking about the movie, massive kudos have to go to everyone involved in the making of this film for keeping it completely secret. Just the fact that nothing at all was leaked until the release of the trailer is completely flabbergasting, all those people involved and nothing.Also to have one teaser trailer released such a short time before the movie was released in cinemas added to the shock and suspense of the film.Now about the film.It's brilliant. I originally planned to watch Cloverfield before seeing this but I didn't get around to it but after seeing this film, you don't actually need to. It's ultimately a brand name with different films under its banner.It has a brilliant cast, which shouldn't be hard considering the case consists of only three people. John Goodman absolutely steals focus and is brilliant in every scene he is in!I didn't realize until the credits started rolling, just how tense I was when I instantly felt the relief of letting myself relax. It's definitely a thriller with twists and turns up until the very end.Don't go into this film expecting a sequel to Cloverfield, you will be disappointed. This is an amazing film, maybe even one of the best of 2016!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Psychological Thriller with a nod of Sci-Fi fun..,"Not a big surprise that a sequel seemed like a logical choice to 2008's ""Cloverfield"" by JJ Abrams as it was a big hit comparatively with a 25 million budget, while grossing right around 170 million. The 'found footage' film about a group of young people surviving a monster attack in Manhattan was driven by a highly sophisticated and fun marketing campaign. Mysterious trailers of the film 'Untitled' left you guessing as to what was the content, was also really well received by critics & film-goers alike.While not quite the exact same thing here, JJ Abrams sees '10 Cloverfield Lane' as a kinsman of ""Cloverfield."" And that's a good description because although there could be a comparison of a few elements, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a very different kind of film and can stand on it's own. Do not expect found footage film or a direct sequel or prequel. '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a pure psychological thriller, with a little taste of Sci-Fi thrown in for good measure.It's mainly undertaken all in one place, the bunker of the mysterious Howard (John Goodman). The bunker is a typical doomsday place: an underground space filled with food, drinks and all the comforts of home, including a cozy living room and fully functional kitchen, ya know, for those underground bunker dinner parties. Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is excellent as the frightened but brave one, who basically MacGyver's her way through this film. Even John Gallagher Jr. as the simple Emmett is well cast. The biggest surprise is John Goodman as Howard, a role that is seemly tailor-made for him, as he turns the effortlessly friendly man into a creepy psycho without ever giving away which of the two he is and in turn, giving us a whole other level of fear.'10 Cloverfield Lane' will truly have the most impact if you have minimal knowledge of it before hand because it's nail biting exciting. And any reviewer that gives away the spoilers or the full story of this one, I wish them years of paper cuts because this is one to be experienced, not told about. The only minus is the last act of the film, here and there, it flies off the rails, But you forgive debut director Dan Trachtenberg for this little whim, as I loved the fact that just when you think it won't go there.. it does! It's very clever and with fresh inspiration, gives just the right subtle nod to its successful predecessor. For those who love psychological mind-bending films like this, you won't be disappointed.Grade: BReview Screening: Wednesday, March 9, 2016 ~ Courtesy of Paramount Pictures",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Surprisingly great, but don't expect a Cloverfield sequel.","Personally I have never been a big fan of the original Cloverfield. I was too young to get the viral marketing, and upon re-viewing it, I thought the story was basic, the characters were annoying, and the found-footage style was irritating. So suffice it to say I was absolutely fine with a ""blood-relative"" of the first film as opposed to a direct sequel. And looking back, 10 Cloverfield Lane is better than the original in just about every way. The characters (and phenomenal actors) are much better, the cinematography is great, and the story is more original and interesting. Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character is an easy protagonist to latch onto, and John Goodman and John Gallagher Jr. are also phenomenal. The only negative aspect of this movie is really the fact that it seems to have nothing to do with the original Cloverfield, but even then, I am much more interested in a Cloverfield series that is more parts Twilight Zone one-offs than it is Godzilla (we have Godzilla for that). Its no masterpiece, but 10 Coverfield Lane is thoroughly enjoyable in about every aspect. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Claustrophobic and Gripping,"Trust me, this IS a review for 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE, it will just take me awhile to get to there.I loved Steven Spielberg's 2005 version of WAR OF THE WORLDS (starring Tom Cruise). It embued an atmosphere of foreboding and claustrophobia while giving us an alien invasion story.I also love Lenny Abrahamson's recent Academy Award nominated film ROOM (the film in which Brie Larson deservedly won the Best Actress Oscar) which told the tale of a mother and son held hostage.Why am I speaking of these two films? Because if you combine these two films you get 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE - a film in the ""Cloverfield family of films"" (don't call it a sequel).For those of you who don't remember, CLOVERFIELD was JJ Abrams 2008 ""found footage"" alien invasion flick. As Abrams describes it, 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE is a different ride in the CLOVERFIELD AMUSEMENT PARK - and what a different ride it is!10 CLOVERFIELD LANE tells the story of Michelle (a very good Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who wakes up in a bunker after a car crash. She has been brought there by Howard (and even better John Goodman). Did he save her? Is she being held hostage? Is his story of alien invasion just a ruse? Is Howard sane? All of these questions need to be answered in the course of this film, and it's the journey to find the answers that makes this film so enjoyable - as well as the action packed last 20 minutes.It is a claustrophobic film, for it spends it's first hour and 20 minutes inside Howard's bunker and we are relying on the interplay between Howard and Michelle to propel this film forward. There is a 3rd person in the bunker, Emit (John Gallagher, Jr). Unfortunately for him (and the actor playing him), this character acts mostly as a foil for the other two so never really has the gravitas of Winstead and Goodman.But the interplay between the two leads is very, very good. Winstead has never been better than she is here as Michelle, the surrogate for us audience members trying to make sense of what is being told her. But this movie really belongs to Goodman. He is a commanding presence who commands the screen every time he is on it and moves from gentle and happy to intense and dangerous at a moment's notice. Is he crazy or is he just trying to keep everyone alive? A truly good actor keeps us guessing and Goodman is a truly good actor.The direction by relative novice director Dan Trachtenberg is surprising good and smooth, keeping us on the edge of our seats - and unsure - throughout this movie.The ""make or break"" of whether you buy into this movie happens in the last 20 minutes, and I won't spoil it here, but, I went with it and really enjoyed my time at 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Adds a new perspective to the original film yet it retained the mystery.,"Initially it was called 'The Cellar', but later it became spin-off to 'Cloverfield'. It was a regular type screen narration, unlike the first film as a found footage style. But if you the original film fan, especially monster film fan, you might end in a disappointment. Because it was a psychological-thriller-mystery than the sci-fi-action- adventure.Only the final act determines where and how it actually connects to the Cloverfield universe, yet not very evident other than the clue the title had given and the filmmakers insisted that is indeed from the same franchise. Because I felt, it was very close to other alien invasion films like 'Skyline' and 'Battle LA' or even the latest 'The 5th Wave' than the 'Cloverfield'.I surely enjoyed this film, like an another crazy bunker hideout theme and something which is quite similar to the recent 'Room'. Since they have revealed its association with the 'Cloverfield', I expected different kind which was actually insanely misled everybody. If there won't be a sequel, then the link between the two films are unnecessary, so I'm waiting for that. But still a very good film without those mix-ups. And I recommend you all to consider it as a one-off film in order to have a great watching experience.Another limited cast film with barely a four characters in it and shot in a single location that cost just $15m, but earned in multiple folds. All the credit goes to the marketing tactics to tie it up with the 2008 blockbuster. It would have also done great independently, in the end everybody, including fans and filmmakers are happy for what it is now.The suspense was so good, but it was carried out for too long. The third act picked up its pace like hell which was obviously anticipated since 'Cloverfield' hooked to it. When everybody was thinking of monsters, it is going to delivers differently and that's how the film fairs.7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Okay, but could have been so much better","A woman, Michelle, is involved in a late-night car crash and knocked unconscious. When she comes to, she is a prisoner in a cell. She is in a concrete bunker deep under the farm house of Howard, who claims he saved her from the crash. Moreover, he claims that her being down here is for her own good, as the US has been attacked, using nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, and the air on the surface is not fit to breath. Michelle is deeply suspicious and thinks this is just a ruse to keep her imprisoned. She looks for ways to escape. She also discovers that there is a third person in the bunker, Emmett.The movie had heaps of potential. Very intriguing initially - the whole crazed kidnapper vs hiding from WW3/aliens puzzle. Even when the movie went more down one of these paths I was still thinking that this was a bluff and that it really was the other.However, was it sets off on the chosen path, there is little in the way of twists. Pretty much a linear story with a not-too-shocking revelation towards the end and some standard action scenes.Just felt very conventional, ultimately, when it could have been something very special.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Very effective thriller with some way over the top ending,"Greetings from Lithuania.The last act of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" (2016) for me was a bit a disappointment, given what a movie successfully established before - a great suspenseful thriller. That said ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a highly enjoyable thriller, with superb performances by all three leads - especially by John Goodman. If you liked the first movie, it kinda doesn't mean you will enjoy this one as well, because the setup and the whole story is set totally different, it only shares the same universe. I was involved into this movie from the first minutes till the end - it was a superbly paced movie.Overall, if not for the last act of this movie, which was i my opinion anti-climatic (considering all that was set up before), ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is superb thriller. It is very involving, with some mystery, very solid acting, great pacing and tight script. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

As good as you might have heard,"Wow, another 10 from me, or maybe it's just I don't bother reviewing the rubbish I see, hmmm.I must say, the makers of this film played the build up to release perfectly, only giving out teasers and very little information.Is it a sequel? Does it have any connection to the first Cloverfield film? Talk about less is more... very clever marketing.Now, the danger in creating hype is the film doesn't live up to it, but in this case the film justified every single bit of hype generated.The three leads gave acting lessons to lesser mortals. Surely the best performance by John Goodman since ""The Big Lebowski"", I couldn't take my eyes off him every time he was on screen.I've only seen Mary Elizabeth Winstead in ""Scott Pilgrim..."" in which she was a bit subdued, but here she was front and center with a fantastic acting performance.The scrip was full of twists, you never know what has really happened and who people really are, something maintained right through to the end.This is the sort of movie they just don't make often enough, clever, well acted, and keeps you on the edge of your seat till the very last second.

The Soundtrack Is The Fourth Character,"Many times, the soundtrack of a movie will be described as a separate character, a unique presence in a movie that operates with its own set of acting and performance skills. This is exemplified by Bear McCreary's fantastic soundtrack here.The soundtrack works fully as an omniscient point of view, in which a narrator knows the thoughts and feelings of all of the characters in the story. McCreary uses his well-developed arsenal of musical devices to predict and react to the action in this movie, but at the same time sticks with the simple, haunting theme.Sometimes soundtracks can be obnoxious and intrusive, but this one dovetails so well into the story it is a fourth character, equally as dazzling as the other three performers. Certainly, Bear's experience with video game soundtracks, as well as his studies with composer Elmer Bernstein, himself a composer of hundreds of film scores, has provided us with a textbook version of what a soundtrack can do.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Unsettling, Thrilling, and Surprising","While I didn't see the original Cloverfield until relatively recently, I understand that it had one of the most inventive and memorable marketing campaigns of this generation. 10 Cloverfield Lane decided to do a similar thing but this time have the plot of the film stay under wraps besides a few minor details in trailers. It was one of the few times I can remember where I went into a movie knowing borderline nothing. For the day and age we live in now where trailers spoil more than half the film? That was refreshing to say the least.I'm going to try and keep the details of the plot to a minimum as I dissect this unsettling thriller. The first film is very much an adventure horror film. It really perfected the found footage take on making a film and may be the last great one we have had (besides Chronicle). 10 Cloverfield Lane is much more in the mystery vain than anything else. We follow Michelle, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, as she finds herself locked up in a cell with a few other people played by John Goodman and John Gallagher Jr without any knowledge of what's going on outside this place.If you were looking for a direct sequel to Cloverfield, this film may disappoint you. There are very little links at all to the first film, but it turned out for the better. For the most part, I didn't want to see any direct links to the first film, I was so invested in what was going on between the 3 characters back at this supposed safe house. John Goodman is very good as Howard, and that's all I'll say because you can't really say anything else without spoiling anything.The real highlight of the film comes from Winstead's strong performance. I've seen her in a few things but none that really blew me away. She was astounding as Michelle and yet another example of a capable and strong female character, something Hollywood should keep up. Bear McCreary's haunting score fits perfectly within the tone and it hits at just the right time with the film's up and down pacing. If I had an issue with the film, it would in fact be pacing. This film starts out fast but it does slow down for a long time before a thrilling final 30 minutes or so.For a first time directing, I was very impressed with Dan Trachtenberg's work here. He captured the feel of the first movie and put his own stamp on it at the same time. The minimal marketing is something I would like to see more of in Hollywood as it proved to be very effective.

Couldn't Be Better,"If you saw the first ""Cloverfield (2008)"" and are expecting this to be a sequel, think again.

Abrahams said, 10 ""Cloverfield Lane (2015)"" is very much ""... a blood relative to Cloverfield"".""10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)"" is the directorial debut of Dan Trachtenberg and stars Marry Winstead, John Goodman, and John Gallagher Jr. Normally, it would be at this point in the review that I would give a brief synopsis of the plot of the movie, but I'm a huge fan of the ad campaign in that is kept the movie an utter mystery. It is best experienced when you know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.This movie grips the audience by the throat and doesn't let go.

survival,"If you are not a claustrophobic person and have not become one during this year 2020 and if your escapist entertainments these days include horror movies you can try '10 Cloverfield Lane' (2016) directed by Dan Trachtenberg. It is the director's first feature film and the only one that he has released on screens so far, but it is a remarkable debut under the careful producer guidance of J.J. Abrams. As in most films produced by Abrams, unexplained phenomena take place and the suspicion of extraterrestrial intervention hovers over this film, but the way the story is told makes us change our perspective all the time and wonder what we actually see on screen. Even the surprising final part, which some will like and others will like less, does not explain everything. The questions will continue to concern the viewers even after the screening of the film ends.The three heroes of the film find themselves together in an underground bunker, after what seems to have been a catastrophic event that made life on the surface of the Earth impossible or dangerous, at least for a while. The air outside seems polluted, and our heroes are among the few survivors. Howard (John Goodman) has been building the bunker for years preparing precisely for such an event, because he is an adept of conspiracy theories and a survivalist. Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), his younger neighbor, took refuge in the bunker in the aftermath of the disaster. Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) got there by hazard (or maybe not), following a car accident caused by Howard, who also saved her life. In the conditions of seclusion and isolation, the dynamics of the relations between the three characters will also develop with them, or rather with the young woman's vision of the situation, because we, the viewers, see the story from her perspective. Does Howard tell the truth? What role does Emmett play - is he a friend or an enemy? Is this a true extraordinary situation or a pretext for a kidnapping? What really happened outside? An attack with atomic or chemical weapons? The invasion of an enemy army? An alien invasion? Or maybe nothing really happened? As spectators, together with Michelle, we will often change our points of view.The movie works very well most of the time. It's helped by the good acting, especially by John Goodman whom the role fits wonderfully, and by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, an actress that I also noticed and liked in season 3 of the Fargo series, which was distributed a year after this movie. The sets, both the bunker that creates a sensation that combines claustrophobia with a feeling of hesitating security as none of the heroes knows exactly what is happening outside, and the few scenes filmed outside, manage to create an atmosphere of tension, amplified by the soundtrack. Most horror and sci-fi fans will be pleased. '10 Cloverfield Lane' does not try to shock excessively or cross the limits of the genre, but skillfully combines familiar elements and themes and manages to provide more than reasonable entertainment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Classic Case of Studio Meddling Interfering With a Promising Script,"Aside from the infamously terrible ending (thanks JJ Abrams!) I have pretty mixed feelings overall with rest of this movie. The concept of 10 Cloverfield Lane is really compelling: after surviving a car accident girl finds her self locked inside a doomsday bunker with a two strange men who claim that the surface is uninhabitable, with one of which you question the true motives of can lead to very tense moments of horror. That being said, I don't feel that Dan Trachtenberg really utilizes this concept to its potential as I don't feel that the characters have any real chemistry with one another, which makes it hard to connect with any of them. This isn't helped by the fact that the soundtrack, while not terribly written, is extremely overbearing and honestly pretty distracting throughout the scenes it gets featured in.I will say though that John Goodman easily gives the best performance out of all of them, he's the only one I feel comes the closest to feeling like a fleshed out character. Perhaps if the script hadn't been edited to be a Cloverfield movie at the last moment when it was never planned on being one, then 10 Cloverfield Lane might have been a pretty tense and thought-provoking low budget thriller. As it stands right now however, it's just kind of a mess.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of the Best Thrillers of 2016,"10 Cloverfield Lane is one of the best thrillers of 2016 so far. One note I would like to say is that this is not a sequel to the original Cloverfield. The film could take place in the same universe in Cloverfield but this is not a sequel. Also if your suspecting the Cloverfield monster to be in this film, your going to be disappointed. This film is a drama, and tense film with some horror elements in it. The acting in the film is great but the one person that stood out the most was John Goodman. He is one of the most underrated actors working in Hollywood today. I believe John Goodman is Oscar-worthy for his performance. This is Dan Trachtenberg's first film he has ever directed and I can't wait to see what he brings in the future. The film also does have an amazing score from Bear McCreary. One other thing a really liked about this film is the sound. The only negative I can say about this film is the ending. The ending felt rushed. The mystery in the film keeps you hooked until the very end and then near the end it felt okay but, this is a film that needs to be viewed a second time. Overall if your a fan of thrillers or very tense films then this is for you. And if they plan on making an anthology with this movie then I'm excited to see what they do next.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good Combo Horror/Sci Fi Thriller,"Is this a horror movie? Is it a sci-fi movie, or a thrilling combo of both genres. You be the judge.Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) decides to end her relationship with her boyfriend and drives off to who knows where. She's driving when something happens and her car goes off the road. Is she dead? she wakes up to find herself in the company of Howard, a wacko survivalist. I loved John Goodman in this role. Boy, he delivers. You learn there is another guy voluntarily in there, Emmett (John Gallagher Jr). Let the games begin.Howard says that something happened, and they need to stay underground for 1-2 years till the air is cleared. Is he lying? He's obviously crazy and controlling. Some of the stories he weaves just don't seem to ring true. But Emmett concurs that something happened.The story weaves itself wonderfully around a cat and mouse game between Howard and his guests. Are they acclimating to the new world, or plotting to overthrow him? What is really happening outside.I can't say more, without revealing too much info. The director does a fine job of pulling this together, but biggest kudos go to the Casting director because the chemistry between the 3 main stars is just dead on fantastic. I recommend seeking out more movies with Ms Winstead, who did an excellent job portraying a fighting woman with a lot of guts.In the end, you may find yourself thinking of various movies, which makes this a unique new type film that I think will inspire similar types based off existing themes.Strap yourself in and take a trip to 10 Cloverfield Lane.

Best Movie I Have Seen in the Theater in a Long While!,"Pure escapism. I'm a big sci-fiction fan so perhaps I'm a little biased. This movie proves that Hollywood still has original ideas, not a lot but still has some. It kept me guessing all the way until the end and never did it seem to drag or dwell on any one topic. Our protagonist becomes trapped with John Goodman and John Gallagher for an indeterminate amount of time because of a supposed attack outside. What we are given is a psychological guessing game between what's real and what's not. John Goodman is extra creepy in this one, probably manic depressive, as he keeps his two guests trapped with little means to escape. It's a little depressing towards the end but without giving too much away, the movie goes full out sci-fi at the film's conclusion. I definitely recommend this to anyone that enjoys thrillers, even if they're not necessarily a Star Wars or Aliens fan. As opposed to it's predecessor, Cloverfield, 10 Cloverfield is 90% psychological. I loved it and hope you will too!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Like Icarus, They Flew Too Close To The Sun","Im simply going to start with, wow. 10 Cloverfield Lane was beautiful.
This is a movie which at base evokes raw emotion. The senses of betrayal, anxiety, helplessness, loss, grief and of-course the gnawing feeling of suffocation and claustrophobia forces the audience to sweat throughout the movie. Which i find amazing, being able to play the audience the way the movie did. The focus through was building atmosphere and creating ambiguity. The viewers take the first portion trying to make sense of what is happening and when they believe they have figured everything out, the rug is swept from under in one smooth motion, leaving the viewer again struggling to understand what is true and what is not. The entire runtime kept the audience on the edge of their seats, from one strange turn to another.
Director Dan Trachtenberg does a great job creating a tense environment where every moment is one to be wary of. Not without giving credit to the incredible screenplay writers and of course the brilliant cast, John Goodman (Howard) , Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Michelle) and John Gallagher Jr. (Emmett). All of who bring an irreplaceable role to the movie, which actually earned each of them awards. The characters each are built and developed beautifully, with the continued air of ambiguity. This makes a death scene truly impactful, which is rare. Imagery, intricately detailed sets and props aid the film greatly, from well placed blood smears to single screws being misplaced, which in turn make the characters seem all the more real. These characters become so well developed that the audience feels true emotion for them, invested in them.
I believe however, the true pulling point for 10 Cloverfield Lane, would be the complete circumstantial ambiguity, the sheer uncertainty of the truth, blatantly baring the power of informational clarity.
Unfortunately this movie which is built underground did not really have a place for the sci-fi, Cloverfield content. Which felt unnecessary at the end of the film, trying to achieve too much. Despite being unnecessary it was still well done, yet it was too much. The movie came off as too ambitious, soaring too close to the sun, seeming to try doing everything because the entire vibe and pace of what appeared to be an absolutely gorgeous experience.
It actually was brought into the Cloverfield franchise without reason, Josh Campbell and Matt Stuecken scripted it as an ""ultra low budget"" movie with an orignial title, The Cellar. However the franchise did indeed grant a 15million USD budget which allowed it to be the masterpiece it is today.
However the last ten minutes were not enough to daunt 10 Cloverfield Lane, as it went ahead winning fifteen various awards, including various for best screenplay, and being nominated for forty six other awards.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the best you'll ever see,This is one of the best movies I've seen all year. It's one of those thrillers that pull you in and never let's go. The concept of spending most of it's inside the bunker for the majority of the film was handled perfectly and you just keep wondering is what's out the bunker worse than what's inside? The cast was great Mary Elizabeth Winstead was a great choice for a female lead and played her role perfectly as well as John Gallagher Jr but it's John Goodman that stole the show for me as he seem like this great guy who may know what's going but just maybe crazy as well. I really enjoyed this and so far the best movie I've seen that has been released this year so far.My rating 10/10﻿,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The ending man.... so close,"I massively enjoyed this. Just not the ending. And here's why.
So the majority of the film is this thriller/mystery and since Michelle is also in the same boat as the audience it's great to watch it all unfold. If the ending was 15 minutes before, it would have been a solid 8/10. Listen, I get this is part of the whole ""Cloverfield"" thing they have going on. But the entire ending sequence is just not needed and just doesn't fit with the tone of the entire rest of the film. Feel as though they just lobbed the ending in just for the sake of it. If this was just simply a thriller movie it would have worked so so well!Acting is really good though, the plot was great (not the end) and the suspense kept throughout was done really well. So yeah, if you enjoy thriller films then definitely give this a watch it really does it well. Just expect a weird end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
People are strange creatures. You can't always convince them that safety is in their best interest.,"10 Cloverfield Lane is directed by Dan Trachtenberg and collectively written by Josh Campbell, Matthew Stuecken and Damien Chazelle. It stars John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. Music is by Bear McCreary and cinematography by Jeff Cutter.Michelle (Winstead) awakes from a car crash to find she is in a locked underground shelter...From the off it has to be said that to know nothing about this film prior to viewing it will be an absolute bonus. For the rewards are plenty. Trachtenberg and his team have crafted a film that is tense from the get go, a piece that consistently has you wondering just what the hell is going on, not only are we puzzled by the three character dynamic in the shelter, particularly as regards Howard (Goodman), the proprietor of this particular shelter, but also just what has happened in the outside world? If anything? This only helps further the claustrophobic feel that's already brought about by the location setting of the tale.A key strength of it, is that it, via Michelle's mindset, coerces us viewers into feeling her unease, and yet conversely we rejoice at her resourcefulness. On the same side of the coin comes her relationship with the third party in the shelter, Emmett (Gallagher Jr), it grows honestly and offers hope in what looks to be a bleak situation. But of course as tale unfolds, things start to come together, edgily so, with little spurts of action, shocks and genuine dread, all building up to the big finale, the reveals. Which will either have you spitting feathers or cursing the makers for the routes taken...Superbly acted by the three principals (it's great that some film makers still realise Goodman is a major talent), and technically impressive for sound and vision, this coiled spring thriller is a winner. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Type of movie that is hard to review. But overall its good.,"If you been reading some of my other reviews (i been reviewing every movies i see for the past 2 years) you will probably know that i am not really someone who watch a lot of ""slownburn movies"". You know movies who move at a very slow pace but build tension. I don't want to say thrillers because thrillers comes in many different ways.Yet i always heard this was a good one to watch and somehow i never was ""spoiled"" about it. I found it on bluray in some video store clearance sale and had it in my watch list for around 2 years.Anyhow i decided to add it to my ""spooky season marathon"" while its still early.Overall i would say i enjoyed it, but without spoiling anything, the ending is the weakest part for me. This is because the actors did a very good job and despite being in one location, the dialogues and atmosphere/tension make the movie really work. It also do not overstay its welcome at only 100 minutes.Now why does it have the name ""Cloverfield""? Yes it does make sense in the movie, but its not a sequel to the movie of the same name. Not in style or in story. It is its own thing.Personally im glad i saw it once but its not a movie i would watch a second time, as its really a story driven movie built on a ""guessing game"" and where it will go.John Goodman is the highlight, but Mary Elizabeth Winstead is also very good, as she pretty much always is. This is actually my second movie with her in this spooky season marathon after The Thing 2011.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Boring,"I see there are a bunch of good reviews for this, but I was expecting, for something described as a blood relative to Cloverfield, something... better. My partner and I left, disgusted having paid to see this.We both nearly fell asleep. Now, this isn't about bad acting, far from it. But the story is very boring in my opinion and lacks imagination. When I say the following, you might agree that the writer just put two different films together with a twist...Misery + War of the Worlds - job done.Went home and watched the latest Paranormal Activity which was far more fun (and isn't that saying something?!).",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The Power Of Mystery,"A lot of times (too many times, really), viewers know everything about a film before they even take their seats in the theater. Trailers, promotional material, internet chatter or what you have, the standard film-advertising philosophy now is to show as much as possible to let viewers know exactly what they are getting and can expect. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" breaks all those rules and is the better for it. Filmed almost entirely in secret at Bad Robot productions, a trailer didn't drop for the film until a scant 4-5 weeks before it premiered. Even that trailer didn't give away a cent of the plot. Because of this secrecy, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is able to do something that other films cannot (or will not): allow the mystery to unfold.For a basic plot summary, this film opens with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) fleeing her boyfriend due to some sort of relationship trouble. Her car is hit, she blacks out, and the next thing she knows is that she is waking up in some sort of bunker chained to the wall. She quickly discovers that she was pulled from the car wreck by Howard (John Goodman), a survivalist who has built a shelter meant to withstand any apocalyptic event. He tells her that the world is in chaos above ground due to some sort of attack (he cannot give exact details about who or what), and that line of reasoning seems to be confirmed by certain events that transpire and the word of Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), the other bunker-mate. But is it really as simple as that? Is Howard truly the benefactor he seems to be?This is one of those films that can't be discussed too much more, because it so deeply relies on the mystery that spoilers can be deadly. Suffice it to say, though, that it truly is a gem in pretty much every aspect. The plot is full of twists, the atmosphere is legitimately tension-filled, and the acting is top-notch all around. It has been quite some time since I've been to a film where I've become that sucked into the events transpiring, but again that is because I was a completely blank slate going in. After the first 15-20 minutes of the experience, I had absolutely no clue what would happen next, and that is one of my favorite types of movie-watching experiences. J.J. Abrams' ""Mystery Box"" is alive and well in this one!Of course, one can't review ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" without commenting on its lineage with ""Cloverfield"". It's actually pretty simple: this one isn't a direct sequel (it's not like it picks right up where ""Cloverfield"" left off or anything like that), but it does take place in the same ""universe"", if you will, of that original film. Kind of an anthology sort of thing, where different stories can be told in the context of one over-arching narrative. While completely different in style from ""Cloverfield"", this ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is just as compelling in telling a unique story.Overall, I was thoroughly engaged by ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" from the opening credits to the closing ones. I hope that more films in the future can follow this type of approach and take a more cagey approach to marketing. Sure, this film has great acting, atmosphere, and story, but it really ""works"" because of that sheer power of the mystery. Since you don't know what will happen, the film-making is given free reign to toy with your emotions, making for a powerful cinematic experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Excellent thriller,"I really enjoyed this movie. My friend was disappointed that it wasn't a monster movie like the first. I understand that.

Twizard Rating: 100,"2008's Cloverfield was an entertaining movie, but 10 Cloverfield Lane brings entertainment to a whole other level.Brilliantly written and coaxially directed, you know very early on that it's not going to be a bad film. When the audience has that kind of trust in the filmmakers, it's a very pleasurable experience. Driven by Bear McCreary's very deliberate score, every moment of this film is calculated and poised.Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Michelle, a young woman running away from something--a relationship, we conclude. Then, not even 5 minutes into the film, something abrupt happens while she's driving. She gets hit by another car, sending her violently spinning off the road.In the next scene she wakes up to a prison-like room with no windows. She's chained to the wall. In walks a man named Howard, played by John Goodman. Goodman plays this role how you wish he'd play every role. He's mysterious and crazy and infernal. You're never sure if you should trust him or not. Sometimes you feel like he's okay, but other times he does things that make you reconsider.It turns out they're in a bomb shelter. There is one other person down there with them--a younger guy, about Michelle's age, named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.). Howard claims, to Michelle and Emmett's ignorance, that the Earth's air is now chemically contaminated and unbreathable. Michelle and Emmett aren't sure what to believe, but they stick together and have no choice but to trust Howard.It's like two movies in one. On the first hand, you have a guy who's insane and may be actually kidnapping you, and on the other hand, there could be a possible post-apocalyptic scenario above ground. But it might not matter either way. Just because a crazy guy has a bomb shelter, doesn't mean he's not still a crazy guy.Director Dan Trachtenberg does a fantastic job in his feature film debut. The movie is almost entirely set in this cramped underground bunker, yet he finds a way to fill all 1 hour and 43 minutes of film without it ever feeling repetitive or boring. We're constantly on the edge of our seats. It's one of the best suspense films in years. Hitchcock would be proud.Twizard Rating: 100",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A Near Perfect Thriller, However Not Like It's Predecessor","10 Cloverfield Lane is directed Dan Trachtenberg, this being his first film, and stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle, a woman who gets into a massive car accident when leaving her fiancé, and wakes up chained to a wall in an underground bomb shelter. Her captor, or possible savior, is a man named Howard, played excellently by John Goodman, who claims there has been an apocalypse, and that the outside air isn't breathable, so she must stay underground. Also in the shelter is a man named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), who also claims there was an end to the world, however he isn't too sure of what's true. Together, Michelle and Emmett must figure out if there was an Armageddon, and, if not, how to escape the madman that has imprisoned them.This film is somewhat of a sequel to Cloverfield (2008), however some say it isn't. In a way, it is, and the connection bears the only downside to the film, but I'll get into that later. Right now, I'll discuss the positives. The best thing about 10 Cloverfield Lane is the suspense. This movie's is easily one of the most suspenseful thrillers I've ever seen, comparable to some of the greats like Se7en (1995) and Psycho (1960). Much of the suspense is due to the great acting, especially from John Goodman. While Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. did amazing, John Goodman gives one of the best performances of the 2010's. Who knew that Roseanne's husband could play one of the creepiest characters brought to film. I really hope to see him in more roles like this, because he killed it.Like mentioned earlier, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. also do fantastic, and aren't necessarily washed out by John Goodman's character. Thank you Hollywood, for finally bringing us a strong, independent female character with Michelle. Rather than some stupid person that constantly needs a guy right next to her for protection and attention, Michelle is strong and can stand alone, and face an evil man such as Howard, without a boyfriend holding her hand. John Gallagher Jr. does really well playing a confused man, wondering whether or not the end of the world is real or not, and whether or not he's being lied to. However, his character, Emmett, isn't really fleshed out all that well. This doesn't really take away from the film, since he's not the lead character. Overall, the movie's about Michelle.The directing is also amazing. 10 Cloverfield Lane is Dan Trachtenberg's first feature film, and he does amazing. I very much look forward to his future films, especially any thrillers he directs, due to just how suspenseful this movie is. All but 10 minutes of the movie takes place in a tiny bomb shelter, and yet the direction seems to open up the bunker, and make it seem bigger than it actually is. This technique is very impressive, and adds a lot to the film, rather than the location get boring after an hour or so. This actually leads me into the next point, which is the run time. This film clocks in at about 2 hours, and it flies by. The run time feels nothing like 2 hours, and a bit more like 45 minutes or so. I honestly felt like I was watching an amazing episode of some horror television show, and it happened to be astounding.Now, it may sound like I'm just praising this movie, but there was a big negative, involving only the last 10 minutes or so of the run time. Describing this with no spoilers is going to be a bit hard, but I won't ruin the movie for anyone who hasn't yet seen it. Now, the whole film, the audience, as well as Michelle and Emmett, are wondering whether or not there was an apocalypse or if Howard is just a creepy kidnapper. We find out at the end, and the outcome isn't bad in itself, but it makes another aspect of the film make no sense. Like I said, hard to explain without spoilers, so I'll just leave it at that, and you'll see what I mean when I watch it.Overall, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a very good movie, and a near perfect thriller, with great acting, including John Goodman's Oscar-worthy performance, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead's great female lead. I'm going to give 10 Cloverfield Lane an A, or a 9 out of a 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Solid movie, but not a Cloverfield film","10 Cloverfield Lane is a really good survival movie with an engaging plot. It reminds me of classic horror survival films like Night of the living dead, a character piece that takes place in a small setting. All three of the main actors do an excellent job, with John Goodman being a standout for his portrayal of a crazy yet paradoxically level-headed man. However it's hampered down by trying to shoehorn a franchise it wasn't originally supposed to be part of.From the beginning, the movie doesn't feel part of the Cloverfield franchise. This is evident in small details, such as the main actress having a modern iPhone when the apocalyptic event took place in 2008. This is a small detail, but it makes the world feel disconnected from the original film, where technology such as camcorders play a critical part in the narration. Speaking of camcorders, this film does not have a found footage style. This wasn't necessary to have in order for the film to be engaging, however it divorces the film from the main filming technique that made the Cloverfield franchise unique in the first place. Because of this, the movie feels out of place from the Cloverfield franchise, and only seems to be tacked on for Marketing purposes.What is most disappointing however is that nothing new is really learned about the ""incident"". The rules aren't consistent from the original film, nothing new is learned about the invaders. It does maintain the shroud of mystery of the ""incident"" that the original film deployed, but that's the only real simultaneity. Simultaneously, knowing that the ""incident"" actually occurred due to knowledge from previous film creates a missed opportunity for mystery and suspense. The main character is not aware if a catastrophic incident actually occurred, and the audience could have questioned this too had there not been a previous film where said event occurred. Fortunately having the knowledge of the previous films doesn't make the plot any less gripping, but it could have been a lot more mysterious without knowing previous events.While I levied a lot of criticisms about this movie, it's still a good script on it's own. And the cast makes the film a delight to watch. It's just a bummer that film executives didn't let the script stand on it's own, as it would have been a much stronger film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A surprisingly tense and well-written movie, this sequel easily surpasses the original","I was skeptical about the new Cloverfield going in. The first movie was good, but not great, and it's rare that a sequel is as good as the original. Coming out, however, it was clear that not only is 10 Cloverfield Lane a clear step above the original, but also a great movie in its own right.While clearly set in the same universe as the original Cloverfield, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a very different beast altogether. It uses a completely new cast of characters, is pretty much set in one location, and forgoes the found footage style of the first one for a more traditional direction. While I thought the found footage was fine in the first one, it definitely wouldn't have worked well in this one.Basically, the plot is about a woman (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who after being in an accident wakes up trapped in a doomsday prepper's (John Goodman) survival shelter with another man (John Gallagher). There is also a cameo by Bradley Cooper. Goodman's character warns that there has been an attack and that the three of them must remain in the shelter for an indefinite amount of time. As you can guess, the situation in this bunker soon turns south. All three give strong performances. This is clearly the best performance of Winstead's career, and the never disappointing John Goodman also gives one of his better performances. Like his character in Barton Fink, Goodman does an excellent job of playing a character who, while not outwardly evil, clearly has something off about him. With only three characters and one location, the performances alone carry this film a long way.That being said, the script also doesn't disappoint, which is penned in part by Whiplash director Damien Chazelle. All three characters are well developed, and while some plot points are predictable, the well-written script never lets the audience know exactly where the movie is going.10 Cloverfield Lane is a tense and exciting movie definitely worth checking out. It's admirable that in this sequel this get smaller rather than bigger (the actual budget is even less than the first). I think this film could become a sleeper hit, and is a must-see for fans of John Goodman or the original Cloverfield.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Put 3 Actors in a Room and Make a Movie!,"I don't know about the extended Cloverfield mythos and so forth, but sticking three actors in a room and expecting a gripping theatrical movie to result--well, that's ambitious.So this film deserves massive respect for doing a lot with very little in the way of space, budget, etc. It's a ""stage play on film,"" and as with any narrow-band sci-fi story, you wonder if there will be contrived situations, melodramatic character quirks, and outlandishly convenient coincidences. But if you're willing to be just a tiny bit generous to the filmmakers you will marvel at how adroit it is, and love how much confidence it has in its own believability.Kudos to John Goodman, who goes enthusiastically over-the-top, making his character a 900-pound gorilla trapped in a phone booth with two squirrels. Good for him. We're going to be staring at this guy for 90 minutes, so don't be boring. He's crazy, but is he CRA- zy?

Mysterious Thriller Delivers on Vague Preview,"10 Cloverfield Lane is exactly why I love doing these previews and reviews. The movie begins, just as the preview suggests, with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) getting into a pretty bad car accident. When she awakens, she is handcuffed to a wall in a bunker. Her captor, or savior, Howard (John Goodman) informs her that it's not safe outside of the bunker. Emmett (John Gallagher Jr) is also in the bunker and appears to be Howard's friend, or co-captor. It takes a little while to reveal this, but Emmett helped Howard build the bunker and begged to be let in when whatever happened outside the bunker happened. Michelle attempts to escape despite Howard's fervent pleas that he is doing this for her own good.The movie was directed by Dan Trachtenberg who really hasn't done much before this release. I love me some John Goodman. Mary Elizabeth Winstead has been around, but isn't a big name actress. She was in A Good Day to Die Hard as John McClane's daughter Lucy and was in a cute film Scott Pilgrim vs. The World as Romona Flowers, Scott's love interest. There's actually a scene in the movie that Die Hard fans will be waiting for Michelle to say, ""Come out to the coast, have a few laughs."" If you don't know what I mean, you aren't a true Die Hard fan. Spoiler alert, she doesn't say it.My point is, you know you're going to get something great from John Goodman and JJ Abrams, but the rest of the cast and crew, along with the preview, leave you wondering what exactly that something is. It's wonderful. It looks like a great thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat and also guessing as to the true motives of Howard and Emmett in the bunker. I had no idea what I was about to get into, but I was excited to see 10 Cloverfield Lane. Just like the ambiguous trailer, the movie itself keeps you guessing as to Howard's true intentions and what, if anything, really happened outside the bunker. It has twists and turns and the last half hour had me saying, ""Wait, what?"" ""No way"" and ""What the what?"" at least 5 times. I anticipated 4.0 stars for a well-written, well-acted, twisting scary movie that I might just want to buy and watch again, and I'm sticking with that. Well worth it and might just add this one to my collected, but definitely want to see again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Pretty good, but not great","10 Cloverfield Lane is a sci-fi mystery film considered to be a ""blood relative"" of the 2008 film Cloverfield. In all honesty, I'm not really sure what to make of what I have just seen. While I enjoyed the suspense and mystery surrounding the plot, the pay-off wasn't really worth the effort.After surviving a car crash, a young woman named Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) wakes up to find herself in a sealed-shut underground bunker owned by a middle-aged man named Howard (John Goodman). Howard tells Michelle there has been a chemical attack and that the rest of the outside world has become uninhabitable as a result. Michelle, believing she is being held captive by Howard, attempts to think of a plan to escape the bunker and see what is really going on outside.Even though I admired the film's ability to build suspense and a sense of realism, I found the ending somewhat anti-climactic. It's difficult for me to go into too much detail without giving away major spoilers so I'll just say that it left me confused. Both John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead give very good performances. Goodman in particular was very menacing throughout the film. You don't need to have seen the original film to understand what is happening in this one so if you like suspense films, then this film is for you. Unlike the original, this is not a found footage film.From a technical standpoint, I rate it 7/10. From a regular film going experience, I rate it 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"It's OK, nothing special","A girl leaves her boyfriend. Of course her sorry boyfriend begs her to come back. It's night on the road as she drives. Suddenly she crashes. She then wakes up with an IV and brace on her knee. The brace is chained to a wall. She freaks out. She's a in a room with some heavy duty steel door. A stranger comes in and offers food. He claims to have saved her, that something is going on outside and that they are save in his underground shelter. He leaves her the key so she can free herself and some crutches. She sharpens the end of the crutch and attacks the guy next time he walks in, but he defends himself and complains bitterly how she treats her even though he saved her life.She hears some cars above, there's a scuffle. Once she becomes more compliant the guy, Howard, let's her out of the room and introduces her to Emmett who's got a broken arm, result of the scuffle with Howard when he somehow forced his way into the shelter. Little by little they get used to each other while always maintaining suspicion. No one knows what really happened outside. For some reason they have no radio, not sure if that would work in the situation, but they have no clue. Michelle continues to think she's held captive until someone screams and knocks on the entrance begging to be let in. Her face is burned. Michelle is dumb enough to actually try and let this woman in but the woman apparently dies.Michelle is a fashion designer and at some point decides to make a home-made hazmat suit and gas mask with the help of Emmett. But Howard is also suspicious of these two and knows they are up to something. Emmett doesn't fare well in the ensuing confrontation. In the end Michelle barely makes it out and we learn what is really going on.10 Cloverfield Lane is a bigger budget minimalist thriller. It's very risky to confine the audience with the few characters in a small space for most of a movie. Usually it turns into an obnoxious movie with a bunch of losers screaming at each other for two hours. This movie fortunately avoids that mistake. Yes, you're stuck with these three for nearly two hours and they sort of try to get along. Howard is a pia. But it makes for some tension, you never know when he is going to flip out or when the other two are going to to something stupid.It's strange that the filmmakers decided to try and build suspense around the question of what it going on in the outside world, when the title of the movie somehow explains it. I haven't seen the first movie but I know what it is about. Hollywood continues to insist on the role-reversal business for who knows what reason. Michelle is both the brains and the brawl. Emmett is the dumb, useless damsel in distress and the other male is the villain. Also annoying was the beginning of this movie which takes place on mute, no dialogue, nor sound effects just lame orchestrated music and this goes on for a while. I almost gave up on this movie after that. The ending too is just a bit too far-fetched, even for a movie a like this. 10 Cloverfield Lane achieves more or less what it sets out to do, but in the end it is a film with low aspirations.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Extremely unpredictable but extremely unrealistic,"***THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS***I know what your thinking: ""Of course it's going to be unrealistic, it's a movie, they're not supposed to be realistic."" I understand that, especially a movie that later on incorporates an extra terrestrial attack on the world.Overall I thought it was an entertaining movie. It DEFINITELY kept me guessing the entire time. What made this movie fall short for me was the completely unrealistic solutions that basically helped Michelle escape the seemingly un-escapable bunker.Emmet and Michelle just happen to find ALL the tools to craft a makeshift hazmat suite. Also, you're telling me that she thought her shower-curtain, soda bottle, duct tape hazmat suite was going to protect her from the deadly gas and nuclear fallout above them? No way.Also, I don't know about you, but if I were being slowly abducted by blood-sucking creatures from another planet, I wouldn't be in the right state of mind to concoct a molotov cocktail in 25 seconds and logically figure out how to destroy the alien by throwing it into its mouth (and of course it works and the entire thing blows up).This movie was definitely entertaining, but in my opinion, they made Michelle out to be too much of a superhero-like character that can escape every life-threatening situation that comes her way.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"An intense, claustrophobic thriller that will make even the veteran movie-goer squirm in their seat.","It's difficult to review a film like 10 Cloverfield Lane because the film is best experienced when the viewer has no earthly idea what it is about. So in this very short review, I simply plead with you to go see this movie if you haven't already. It's a well- crafted thriller that grabs a hold of you and never lets go.I can't remember the last time a movie had me on the edge of my seat like this. The beautifully eerie cinematography and perfect score by Bear Mcreary (The Walking Dead) set the foundation for the suspenseful ride that is, 10 Cloverfield Lane. John Goodman gives an Academy Award level performance that is generally unexpected in this type of movie. Mary Elisabeth Winstead plays one of the greatest protagonists in recent memory for a horror/thriller picture. (She's come a long way as an actress since Final Destination 3!) This film also brings John Gallagher, Jr. to my attention for the first time - not counting Jonah Hex, because I remember nothing from that awful movie - anyway, I wouldn't be surprised if he became a household name in the next few years. There were no weak links in the cast.The suspense in the movie builds quickly but steadily, never over-working itself or feeling as though the director is rushing to get to the next scare. The movie taunts you and misdirects you over and over, until what I believed to be an incredible climax. Apparently some were not thrilled with the ending, although I think it was perfect. However, in the end, it doesn't matter.Watching the characters develop and this terrifying plot unfold is such a satisfying journey that no matter how you feel about the ending of the film, you'll be glad you were a part of the ride that took you there.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An effective thriller dominated by Goodman's terrific turn,"What a strange situation one finds themselves in when talking about a film like 10 Cloverfield Lane, one that somehow, in today's climate of information overload, managed to remain secret until launching during this year's Superbowl extravaganza despite it being a sequel/prequel or who-really-knows-what to 2008's Cloverfield.Produced by the frequently busy and impressively consistent J.J Abrams, 10 Cloverfield Lane is easily one of the most mysterious releases of recent times and benefits greatly from its short life in the public exposure spotlight before releasing late last week, as it is a story and experience that is best watched how it was intended to be: with as little foresight into its goings on as possible. While the film is by no means earth-shatteringly good, it's an effective thriller that acts as a fine companion piece to its shaky cam for-bearer.Ditching the format of Matt Reeves original film, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a much more intimate and confined story that is every bit as mysterious as the film's conception. Without giving the it's subtle twists and turns away, at its core Lane is the story of Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Michelle who finds herself underground and sheltered from a supposedly earth shattering attack by John Goodman's conspiracy theory loving, ex-Navy vet Howard, who has long been preparing for the end of days. Joining the mismatched duo is John Gallagher Jr's Emmett, a kindly farmer type that helped build Howard's shelter, and we therefore have our players in this fingernail chewing narrative.First time feature length director Dan Trachtenberg and screenwriters including Whiplash director Damien Chazelle do fine jobs of hiding the relatively simple set up of the film, by using a clever pacing and gradual reveal of character motivations and traits, and for the film's opening third that is totally dominated by an awards worthy turn from a scarily good John Goodman. Lane is an absorbing watch let down only by some questionable decision making and a final 20 minutes that undoes much of the film's groundwork that was so successfully laid, and with that a slight feeling of disappointment lingers as the credits roll on and we're left to reminisce about the movie's earlier glories.Those expecting 10 Cloverfield Lane to be cut from the same cloth as its namesake will be disappointed, but within this often tense and finely tuned thriller is an impressively taut tale that's bought to life brilliantly by Goodman (who hasn't been better in years) and to a lesser extent leading lady Winstead who keeps threatening to really break out with each passing project.It's a joy overall to sit back and watch a film you know very little about, and without the usually strong expectations of yearlong marketing campaigns at its back 10 Cloverfield Lane is an enjoyable success let down somewhat by an ending better suited to another film and decision making by its characters that at times ruin the films good work.3 unfinished cat puzzles out of 5",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Beyond a sequel...and just entertaining,"No spoilers...don't worry. After watching Cloverfield, I first hated the shaky cam on purpose idea, but the theme of the movie got me. Then I watched Super8, which made me realize that JJ is actually a good storyteller. By not showing what is scary, he lets his actors and the story make people enjoy the film without demanding a monster after 10 minutes. Force Awakens was pretty much an ALL YOU CAN EAT Buffet of stories in movie world, so don't judge him for not being more original in that one.10 Clov. Lane had enough of everything to give you a grin due Goodman's awesome acting, an eyebrow raise to the OOH Shoot moment and enough edge to expect more. Some people will probably say that WTF does this story have anything to do with the 1st. Hence my title, it is not just a sequel, nor a prequel. You can watch both in any order and you will enjoy both, in my opinion. 1 point to fix would be Emmet's character and perhaps the actor's take on it. He is first portrayed as someone dumb whitted, not knowing the difference between North and South Korea, but then later on figuring some stuff out and actually being smarter than he seemed. But it wasn't that kind of a movie to have a character that either A: develops into a smart young man or B: is secretive about who he really is. So the writers should have just have him stick with one side. The 2 leads were awesome, I really enjoyed the attention to detail in directing. After watching BatmanVsSouperman and just being tired of watching something that should have been better foreshadowed for 3 hours, this film uses almost every shot to it's benefit in the future. And one thing I can spoil you with is this : I hope and I think there will be a sequel. There has to be....you will see",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A film of many unpredictable turns,"So to start off with, this film is amazing and I can't imagine there being a demographic that couldn't enjoy it. You should see it if you haven't because as I just said, it's amazing.Before the film has even begun you draw assumptions about it based on its name and the previous film relating to that title. Abandon all that as much as you can, this film takes on so many forms and keeps changing direction so as to shake the audience out of those preconceptions and force you to enjoy the film for the fantastically unpredictable beast that it is. At one point it seems to be a hostage film, then horror, then briefly a buddy film, then horror again and then ends on a seemingly completely unrelated twist that will have every muscle in your body invested in the conclusion to the story.Cloverfield was a fairly good alien horror film and an OK film overall, whereas 10 Cloverfield Lane squarely surpasses any ambition and story telling skill displayed by the film it shares a semblance of its name with. This film is superior in every way and is such a roller-coaster ride of ever-changing direction that I fail to think of anything close to what it accomplishes that I could compare it to.Go. Watch.

"The Less You Know, The Better","The trailer for this film instantly caught my attention and it immediately planted a seed of doubt as to what was truly going on – who are the good guys and the bad guys? Who's telling the truth? The great thing about 10 Cloverfield Lane is that the air of mystery transcends throughout the lifespan of the film – from the very limited information divulged from a very clever marketing campaign to the first two acts of the actual film, you are constantly questioning every aspect.Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who you may remember from the 2011 remake of The Thing and (one of my personal favourites) Scott Pilgrim vs The World, plays Michelle and what an amazing performance. She's such a talented actress and this may be the first film where she will be truly recognised for her abilities. The movie opens with Michelle on the run, driving as far away as she can after what appears to be a dispute with her fiancée Ben. She is soon involved in a car crash and finds herself chained to a pipe in a dank basement. It's not long before she meets her captor (or saviour?) Howard – played by a chilling John Goodman. His character is a far cry from Dan Conner in Roseanne but his variety of roles lately have proved that he is a Hollywood heavyweight well- deserving of overdue praise.From this point onwards, the film begins to play a frustrating game with our psyches – Howard claims that he has in fact saved Michelle after her accident from what might be a potentially fatal biohazardous attack. Michelle, however, has her reservations about what Howard's true intentions are and what I loved most about this movie is that it is a long time before you are really certain as to what's going on.This is one of those films that the less you know, the better so I won't continue with any further information than this. My one qualm was with how the film ended but it's very minor compared to how much I truly enjoyed this insane thrill-ride that had me at the edge of my seat the entire time.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Classic Case of Doesn't Know How (or When) to End,"""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is 15 minutes of big-budget Hollywood sci-fi awkwardly tacked on to 90 minutes of claustrophobic psychological thriller. The end result is a film that kept me pretty engaged for the majority of its running time, only to end by leaving me pretty disappointed and feeling like I'd been duped into sitting through nothing but an excuse to make a sequel.John Goodman gives a fantastic performance as a survivalist who may or may not be a lunatic and who's keeping a young woman (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) sort of held captive in his bunker for motives that may or may not be admirable. As you might have guessed, there's a whole lot of ambiguity at the center of the film. We don't know exactly what's happening or why; we don't know who can be trusted and who can't. And both the fun and the tension in the film come from seeing plot points tick into place, sometimes clarifying things for us, other times confusing us even more. But this is a movie that suffers from a severe case of ""we don't know how to end this,"" and it goes off the rails in a bad way in its last 15 minutes. Goodman's character turns into a laughably hokey monster when up to that point in the movie he's been anything but, and a series of actions carried out by our heroine stretch our credibility past its breaking point. I didn't have a problem with the big reveal at the film's climax, but the movie should have ended with it instead of continuing on long past the point when the novelty of the film's twist wears off.Not a total loss by any means, but definitely leaves the taste of misfire in the viewer's mouth.Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Enjoyed it,"Howard, played well by John Goodman, rescues Michelle, played perfectly by current scream queen Mary Elizabeth Winstead, from a car crash. He brings her to his underground doomsday bunker where he tells her everyone else is dead due to some unknown nuclear or bio-chemical attack. The only other inhabitant in the bunker is Emmett, played by John Gallagher Jr. from 'The Newsroom', who helped build the bunker and was lucky enough to make it there just before Howard locked it for good. The rest of the movie unfolds while you, Michelle and Emmett try to figure out if Howard is bats*&t crazy or has really saved the day with his bunker. This leads to some well formulated but somewhat predictable encounters and twists with Howard.It was a fun movie and had some truly creepy and edge of your seat moments. I preferred the psychological thrills as opposed to the straight up scares but both aspects were delivered well if a little by the numbers. Like most horror/thrillers, it's probably best viewed with a large audience and it almost certainly won't be as good on the home screen. I didn't see the original Cloverfield but the word of mouth from my friends at the time of its release was something like 'sucked', and 'the hand-held cameras made me sick.' There's no hand-held footage in this movie so don't let that deter you and it was definitely worth the price of admission. Special shout out to Bear McCreary for the score. For those who don't know, he does the music for 'The Walking Dead', 'Black Sails' and several other recent projects. He's become sort of the new Danny Elfman.If there's a sequel ...

I like about 85% of it,"liked about 85% of it. The 10% that didn't sit well is the ending and 5% is the spaces between the emotional beats. But it is still an immensely entertaining movie.This movie feels like a Twilight Zone TV episode extended to feature length. It is very tightly focused on three principals with a tension that builds ominously. The tension is psychological, not gimmicky. My mind is constantly engaged, pondering what is the truth and which is the lie. The debut director, Dan Trachtenberg has done a superb job of subverting my expectations and tropes all the way through the first two acts. It is the spaces between these beats that didn't quite score with me.I like this particular problem solving genre in which an ordinary person has to use his/her particular skills to solve problems. That's why I love b-grade lousy movies like Deep Blue Sea and Anaconda. Mary Elizabeth Winstead carries her role well and she is totally convincing as the non-damsel in distress. But the actor that made the whole movie worked is definitely John Goodman. His geniality coupled with his sinisterly behaviour is a potent concoction. It is John Gallagher Jr as the third wheel in the mix that I find weak. His sole purpose is to be a sounding board for Winstead's Michelle and to push the plot forward.The first two acts is a piece of superb filmmaking. Trachtenberg performed some tricky tonal shifts marvellously. There was suspense, melodrama and comedy intermixed together so well that the seams disappear. Coming into the final act the narrative totally abandons the subtlety and nuanced storytelling and moved into the typical Hollywood bombastic ending. For me, the tonal shift was too seismic to resonate with me emotionally. But I think it will work for most people based on the reviews I see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A strangely uneven mix of thrills and disappointments,"Eight years ago, Cloverfield was a very effective genre mix of Godzilla and The Blair Witch Project. It became a hype that delivered, thanks to a brilliant viral marketing campaign which enticed the audience with shocking images, but without revealing too much of the story itself. I guess it could be called a miracle that the makers were able to wait so long and (undoubtedly) resist studio pressure for a quick sequel, and then produce a successor under the radar, one whose existence wasn't revealed until a few months before the premiere.That is the good news. The bad news is that 10 Cloverfield Lane is a disappointing sequel on many levels. First of all, it isn't even a sequel. Marketing it with creative re-use of the original's title really created some false expectations, because 10CL has nothing to do whatsoever with its predecessor. It has a completely separate story, no familiar characters or locations, and the events of the previous film aren't mentioned or even referenced. In genuine J.J. Abrams 'Lost' style, you would have expected to see something familiar on a TV screen or in a picture frame to connect the dots, but there isn't (apart from a 'Slusho' sign, and there may be a 'Kelvin' reference that I missed, but those don't count). The closest 10CL comes to is a companion piece or side story set in the same universe, but the only small narrative connection to the original (something with a satellite) is such an obscure geeky reference that 99% of viewers will only discover it on this film's trivia page. It would have been great had it started out as something completely separate, and then slowly revealed its connections to the original. This could have created a stand-alone sequel, while still engaging the audience with insider hints. Sadly, the makers missed this opportunity, which isn't entirely surprising, since this movie was originally an unrelated film that was reworked into a Cloverfield successor halfway through.But still, even a disappointing sequel or side story can be great in its own right. I have enjoyed movies like Hannibal and installments in the Alien and Terminator series that way. I am not fundamentally opposed to the idea of a successor that is completely different in style and execution. No found footage-style cinematography this time, since 10CL is a psychological thriller rather than a adrenaline-fueled creature feature. This is okay as long as it is done well, but here it all felt way too familiar for me. Producer J.J Abrams is certainly no stranger to recycling familiar plots and elements from other movies, but he usually combines or presents them in ways that makes them feel fresh again (just look at Cloverfield, Super 8 and The Force Awakens). Unfortunately, the main plot of 10CL in the bunker is more than a little bit similar to a story arc from the second season of his own series 'Lost', whereas the finale evokes a strong déjà-vu from several better science-fiction movies. Never before did one of his productions feel unoriginal to the point of being worn out.And there is more to complain. The beginning certainly shows promise, with Mary E. Winstead leaving her apartment with only the score playing. After an adrenaline-spiking accident, the movie shifts back gear to the most boring part of the movie. We are supposed to invest in the trio of characters, but they are too one-dimensional for us to really care. Winstead's character clearly had some relationship issues, but the writers simply fail to use that premise later on to the character's (and story's) advantage. John Goodman is always good as a man who looks and acts like he means well, but can turn violent in a second (it was almost hard not to think of his work in several Coen brothers movies, if I'm honest). The script certainly creates a compelling mystery surrounding his past actions and present intentions, but again, when it is time for the pay-off at the end, the writers simply do not deliver on that promise. John Gallagher is the only one who benefits from a character scene which makes his persona less than the average redneck he starts out to be, and he gives the movie the memorable twist that actually works (more about that later).There are other good things to be said for the movie. After 45 minutes of boring character introductions, the movie starts to pick up pace and build tension. It was no doubt the creators' intention to keep the audience guessing if the danger comes from outside, or from within, and it works until about 15 minutes before the end. Then we get another twist that answers that question, and although it brings back some of the thrill and adrenalin that Cloverfield had, it simply doesn't feel satisfying; 15 minutes really is too short, and it is such an abrupt change in style and genre that it pretty much reduces the first 90 minutes to an overlong and unimportant prologue. Again, with better writing, the three acts could have been married happily together instead of feeling like three completely separate movies.So to summarize, 10CL is a bold attempt to extend the cinematic universe from Cloverfield in another direction, but sadly without much of the ingenuity and spark of inspiration that we are used to from J.J. Abrams' team. He calls it a 'blood relative' to the original; I'd say its that slacker of a second cousin twice removed that everyone prefers to ignore. It looks like the Master of Pop Culture himself was too busy with producing and directing The Force Awakens, so if they are making a third one to bridge the first two films, I recommend having him fully back on board.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Claustrophobic, tension filled thriller - NOT a sequel","I tend to enjoy writing spoiler reviews more than non-spoiler ones, however with this film I truly do not want to give anything away. I want everyone to have the same experience I did when I watched this film. Which is a good experience. Very good.The premise at a glance is that Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is involved in a car accident after an argument with her boyfriend, and all of a sudden, she wakes up in an underground bunker being held by a man named Howard (John Goodman) who claims there has been some sort of chemical attack on the surface, and that it isn't safe to leave. However, Howard may not be the all the saviour he seems to be. That is all I'm going to say in regards to plot, as anything more would be considered a spoiler due to J.J. Abrams excellent marketing campaign similar to The Force Awakens: never give too much of the film away.The beauty of this film was the unknown. I haven't watched Cloverfield (2008) for a good few years, and made the decision not to re-watch it before the 'sequel', in order to fully appreciate the film as an original. In fact, it is not really a sequel at all. If you go into this movie expecting raucous action you will not enjoy it; it is a claustrophobic, tension-filled thriller, and a movie in itself as opposed to a follow-up.John Goodman steals the show. After watching some of his more comedic films like The Big Lebowski (1998), I thought perhaps that is the character I would see whenever he spoke, but that was not the case at all. Goodman is a phenomenal actor, and I believe this is some of his best work. He had the perfect believable balance between insanity and rationalism and is genuinely terrifying in the movie, on par with Javier Bardem in No Country for Old Men (2007). You are never too sure whether he is bending the truth, telling the truth or lying, and as a viewer we explore much of this through Michelle and fellow bunker- bound Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.). There was also much impressive acting on Winstead's behalf. The only other film I had seen her in was Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (2010), which is a fun movie, but doesn't flair up her acting capabilities as much as her performance in this flick. Her non-cheesy portrayal of what could have been the classic 'damsel in distress' was in fact extremely commendable. Playing the relatable character in the film, all of the choices she made were believable and thought-out, which is what many modern actions/dramas tend to lack, leaving the viewer thinking who in their right mind would do that?As Chris Stuckmann noted in his brilliant review, the film didn't feel like it had to become bigger than the one it shares a name with (NOT a sequel). The studio in fact did the exact opposite, creating the movie solely from a very small set of perhaps five rooms within the underground bunker. This impressed me as it meant the film relied completely on the characters and dialogue, which was a bold move for debut director Dan Trachtenberg. The score composed by Bear McCreary was also compelling and very much added to the darker scenes, in both senses of the word. I particularly enjoyed the sudden changes in tone whenever Howard entered a room or spoke, a small aspect that can often completely change a scene subconsciously.The lack of music in particular scenes also worked in adding tension and uncertainty to the film.My only criticism of the film, and even here I have to think about it, is that the ending could be seen as rushed. Without spoiling anything, the 'reveal', as it were, was eloquently done, however that wasn't the strong point of the film. The acting and dialogue indefinitely compromised for this minor critique, and I would recommend that you see this film as soon as possible to avoid it being spoiled!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Kept me interested right up to the end,"24 March 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - 10 Cloverfield Lane. Michelle is running away from her problems and gets into a car accident. When she wakes up she find she and one other are being held by a man called Howard who is a little strange to say the least. He claims there has been some sort of attack and that they are the only survivors. He has built a bunker over many years in preparation for such an attack and is now arrogant in his belief that he was right all along. However, all is not as it seems and Howard (played exceptionally convincingly by John Goodman in one of his best performances ever) is more than a little scary. I'm not usually a fan of this sort of film but it was less of the horror and more of the thriller. You know a film must to rely on a well written script, and a great group of actors when the main cast numbers three and the scenes are shot in one small space. This film did just that admirably and the hairs raised on the back of my neck more than once as each plot twist fed us just that little more information to keep us interested but not enough to answer all our questions. It will not be for everyone but I was glued to my seat as the film came to an interesting conclusion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good in the moment even if not hugely satisfying overall,"Like the film Cloverfield, I only heard of this film from a trailer seen recently, and decided to give it a go despite knowing very little about it. This is how the film wants it, and how it works best; it does this itself from the start where we learn a little about Michelle but there join her in her disarray and unknown circumstances. Not knowing the picture outside the bunker or really inside it either, means that mostly you are intrigued by either. The use of music and direction within the bunker does owe a lot to Lost – in particular its juxtaposition of dated domesticity against a bigger picture of unknown dangers (maybe) – and it does work even if it is a bit familiar.Mostly though it is the performances that make it work. Winstead and Gallagher are solidly convincing, but it is Goodman that feeds the tension. The old adage 'just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not after you' applies here, and his character is unsettling in the detail. The inner and outer stories don't totally satisfy in their specifics and their end-points, however just as the trailer works to hook you in, the film is good in any specific moment. Unfortunately those moments don't all work as well as one another, and they don't come together into a satisfying whole as you may wish.In the end it does have the feeling of a well-constructed product, which benefits from smart casting, writing, production, and marketing – but not necessarily story-telling. It was still entertaining as I watched it, but it didn't really leave a lasting mark, and it isn't really inspiring a second viewing now that I know what it holds",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Defining a Cloverfield franchise,"When the trailer dropped for 10 Cloverfield Lane, it caught everyone by surprise. Nobody really knew if there were plans for a sequel to the 2008 film 'Cloverfield', let alone if they even began shooting for it. But then, out of the blue, we get this awesome trailer and everyone knew, this was going to be something special. And by god, it was.THE PLOTMichelle, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, is a young woman who's on the run. Not from the authorities but from her troubled life. She gets into an accident and wakes up, chained to a wall in what turns out to be an underground bunker. She is being held there by Howard, portrayed by John Goodman. Howard claims there has been an attack, chemical or otherwise, and that he saved her from certain death. Michelle doesn't know what to believe and can only guess what Howard's real intentions are. She isn't Howard's only guest though. Emmet, brought to live by John Gallagher Jr., is the third wheel and it's this trio you'll be spending the entire film watching. The story is build up perfectly. It balances true suspense with genuine and upbeat moments. As a viewer, you're constantly put on a wrong track or left guessing because the twists and turns the story takes are masterfully executed. This only works because the film takes its time to build them up and because you're experiencing the story and this universe through Michelle's eyes only. You as a viewer only know and see what Michelle knows and sees which to me personally ads more suspense than knowing something the protagonist doesn't.THE ACTINGMary Elizabeth Winstead really nailed this performance. She was likable, clever and strong. You really rooted for her because she could think on her feet and made really smart choices. You knew from fairly early on that if she would figure out what was going on or how to escape if need be, she only had her wits and strength to thank. Her own personal story really resonated with me and it made her a great all-round character. John Gallagher Jr. is a name I'll remember from now on. I wasn't familiar with his work but I'm impressed with his performance. He was more than a comical note in this film and had his own important contribution to the story. You really do care about him and his story. Finally, I have to talk about the absolute highlight of this film. John Goodman's performance is truly Oscar worthy. He just steals every scene he's in and knocks it out of his bunker and out of the park. He was terrifying, not just because of his size but because of his presence. He is a force to be reckoned with and the film ads so much to his character by doing all these subtle things: hearing his footsteps approach from a far, hearing his constant heavy breathing and taking time to show all the little nuances he put in his performance.THE CINEMATOGRAPHYVisually this film is absolutely brilliant. As said, the entire film is experienced through Michelle's perspective and the cinematography is dedicated to this perspective. The camera is always close to Michelle, looking over her shoulder or showing her in a close-up shot. The camera will only pull back when the tension subsides for a while, which is a very effective way to create this contrast. During the finale of the film, the camera pulls back in and never lets go of Michelle. The tension in this scene is therefor all the more gruesome.THE SOUNDTRACKThe score for 10 Cloverfield Lane is great. It's not outstanding or Oscar worthy but it does help create tension. When competing with an outstanding script and an even better cast, it's hard for a score to compete and really stand out, which is a compliment for both the cast and the writers, more than it is a critique on the score itself.THE NEGATIVESBeing called 10 Cloverfield Lane, is probably one of the biggest problems of this film. Many viewers and fans, myself included, were expecting a sequel or prequel to 'Cloverfield'. This is not the case. One could even argue that these films aren't taking place in the same universe. Going into this film I knew I wouldn't get a sequel because I did some research. Nevertheless, I kept waiting for the Cloverfield monster to turn up but it never did. The climax for this film will definitely satisfy most viewers and even fans but I can't deny that die-hard fans will be disappointed. But I believe I figured out what J.J. Abrams and his entourage were going for...DEFINING A FRANCHISEI believe that with this film, a franchise has been defined. Many people wanted it to be monster- or found footage franchise , but it turned out differently. From now on, an entry in the Cloverfield franchise will be a science fiction film, grounded in the real world and at the center of these films will be a disaster that takes place. In the first one we got a huge monster, rampaging through New York, in the second a possible chemical or nuclear attack that devastated the United States. Thinking about this, one can only wonder what the third film will be... However, nothing is certain at this point and seeing how Abrams fooled our expectations with 10 Cloverfield Lane, I wouldn't bet my head on me being right.THE VERDICT10 Cloverfield Lane is a masterfully executed, psychological thriller with stellar performances and great characters. It thrives on its tension and great writing and it keeps you guessing through the whole thing. It's a great film and even better one if you check your expectations at the door.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Slow paced mystery thriller with some sci-fi thrown in for marketing purposes,"Some parts of the movie were great, some not so much. An unevenly good film with a great concept, good acting but some pacing problems.

He was equal parts a lovable teddy bear (check out the scene when he put on some music - LOL) and a really creepy crazy person. The other actors were OK, but I wouldn't call their performances great. The story is taking people you know nothing about and putting them in a situation where reality cannot be verified. When someone says or does something, you wonder if they are crazy or they are actually for real.In effect, the result is a slow paced character piece. It is not about sci-fi and it is not about what the hell is going on - even if you wonder about that the whole movie. It is about the people. However, since nothing is revealed until the end of the film and since you know nothing of the people to start with, it is very difficult to empathize with any of them, therefore it all feels like a too long escape from a room type of a game.The ending is just something that artificially connects this film with Cloverfield and tries to add the sci-fi tag to it. It makes little sense and in fact it is the reason why I only rated this movie as average.Bottom line: if not for JJ's pretentiousness, it would have made a really good Outer Limits episode. As such it feels too long and the ending just makes it feel fake. Too bad, it was a refreshing concept.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Effective well-acted thriller,"Cinephile here. It's such a relieve to spot a watchable movie these days between all the unwatchable netflix pulp. This one kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. You just want to know how the story unfolds And the acting is faultless too, with a grim deadly serious John Goodman and a gorgeous female lead character by the way. It's probably a pretty low budget production too and I value it even more for that because it is so effective with a view plot twisting turns. We want more of these! Good and slightly weird plot. Top notch acting, skillfully made. Movies that can really keep your attention from beginning to end are pretty rare, this one has it all, go see it!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Eerie, chilling and ultimately a barrel of fun.","A ""spiritual sequel"" to Cloverfield, as producer of both films J.J. Abrams refers to it, this low-budget thriller breaks through the limitations of a single-location setting to generate mystery, apprehension and a healthy dose of the heebie-jeebies. Predominantly taking place in an underground bunker with only three inhabitants, the movie breeds unease and uncertainty on two different levels: was Earth actually attacked by extra-terrestrials? And is John Goodman's intense bunker-owner a monstrous killer? From a technical perspective, director Dan Trachtenberg effectively mines tension by juxtaposing loud, frenetic and in-your-face sequences of chaos with slowly building scenes of nerve-shredding silence and stillness. There is a point, however, when the imposing sound design becomes wearisome and the narrative propulsion relies a little too heavily on dubious plot contrivances. And the less said about the final 20 minutes – with an unwelcome and unnecessary sharp right turn – the better. The core on screen trio are a treat though. Goodman's bipolar whirlwind of a man is a force of nature you can't help but watch, whilst Mary Elizabeth Winstead is strong and likable as the sole female presence and John Gallagher Jr is endearingly normal as the third wheel. Stir into the mix a wonderfully off-kilter soundtrack and well-judged spurts of violence, and 10 Cloverfield Lane offers more than enough chills and thrills to be worth a trip to the cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"An Intense, Layered Mystery That's Almost Undone by an Over-Indulgent Climax","Really effective twisting, turning, second-guessing suspense with an ending that hangs around for way too long and disrupts the great atmosphere it had just established. For the most part, this is a fine example of making the most of a small set and an even smaller cast. The three-person acting team draws every bit of fear, loathing, confusion and betrayal from the simple, efficient script. We explore every nook and cranny of John Goodman's bunker until it all feels like home, making for a thrilling game of hide-and-seek when the tension inevitably boils over. The terror is mostly psychological and quiet, which makes the infrequent bursts of sound and fury all the more effective. These aren't just jump-cuts, they're bullets through the fog. They carry meaning and consequence, reverberating well beyond the moment of impact. And if it had ended about ten minutes earlier, the shock of its final reveal would've been maintained without spoiling any of that work. A pity, then, that it reaches all the way into summer blockbuster territory in some vain attempt to tie things into an otherwise-unrelated preceding film. This may not have enjoyed as many eyeballs without that extra word in the title, but it would've been so much more effective as a film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Positively surprised.,"I was honestly expecting one of the worst movie experiences of the year, but I have to admit 10 Cloverfield Lane did surprise me quite a bit. In a positive way. A girl escapes her house, and after a car crash where she loses control of her car, she wakes up locked in a basement where a man claims that the world is under attack. Terrified by her apparent kidnap, she desperately tries to find a way to escape, but she soon realizes that the man who is locking here in the house might actually be telling the truth about what is going on out there. 10 clover field lane is entertaining because you are never too sure about which way the movie will head. You'd like to think that the guy who kidnaps the girl is a psychopath, but then you are made to think he's not, then you think he is, then you think he's not. I guess, you will need to see the movie till the end to know who is evil and who is not in this movie. Not necessarily a must watch movie, but entertaining enough.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Tense and frightening. Co.pletely different to the other Cloverfield but still ties in well,"After watching Cloverfield I felt I had to watch this. I knew that this was very different and what it was about but although stuck in a small claustrophobic space (completely different to the previous film) it held my attention.The twists and reveals throughout the movie progress and occur at just the right time to keep you interested. The three main actors are all great but John Goodman, it must be said is very good as a slightly deranged ""saviour prepper"".Also the ending in my opinion fits perfectly with the film and the main characters development too.Film has some disturbing themes and only occasional bouts of violence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Tense & Engaging!,"The second film in the Cloverfield franchise, '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a Tense & Engaging Sci-Fi /Psychological Thriller, that is diverse & much more engrossing than its first-installment. This one's a claustrophobic ride, with a Fantastic Performance by The Ever-Amazing John Goodman.'10 Cloverfield Lane' Synopsis: After getting in a car accident, a woman is held in a shelter with two men, who claim the outside world is affected by a widespread chemical attack.'10 Cloverfield Lane' is Sharply Written by Josh Campbell, Matt Stuecken & Damien Chazelle. The tense proceedings are expertly written, as you do feel for the lady in trouble. The claustrophobic mood (the film is set in a bunker), is eerie, but suits the film well. What I was particularly impressed by was the flow of the narrative. It slowly warms up & ends on a strong note. Of course, I personally thought the end would be a bit different, but it still works. The Writing is solid, at most parts. Dan Trachtenberg's Direction is marvelous. He has handled the tense as well as the dramatic moments, with flourish. Jeff Cutter's Cinematography creates the claustrophobic mood, most aptly. Stefan Grube's Editing is well-done. Art & Costume Design are first-rate. Graphics are good.Performance-Wise: John Goodman steals '10 Cloverfield Lane'. The Legend is Magnificent in a role, that is perhaps, his scariest till date. We've seen Goodman be intimidating before, but his turn here, is undoubtedly his creepiest to date. Academy, are you hearing? Mary Elizabeth Winstead does very well as the protagonist in trouble, delivering an arresting performance. John Gallagher, Jr. is superb & adds some light moments in the otherwise tense proceedings.On the whole, '10 Cloverfield Lane' gets most of it right. Its certainly worth a watch!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"One of the most tense, gripping, engaging and clever films I have seen in a while","I loved the trailer to this movie when I saw it and was incredibly pumped and I just got back from seeing it and it was incredible, a part from the ending, which I will get into, it doesn't ruin the movie but it was a bit disappointing.The acting from everyone was great, they really made you believe they were these people and were in this situation. The characters were engaging and the chemistry between the three actors was very good.The score was also superb and it really added to the tense atmosphere. The first 20 minutes or so is mostly score, and when it stops it really makes the silence in the film more impactful and added to the tension. The story is intriguing and you don't know what is going to happen next. It is never boring and is paced really well. At each major plot point the film just gets more and more interesting.And the cinematography is rather good. Especially at the beginning of the film, the camera moves around Mary Elizabeth Winsteads room and it focuses on certain objects and her facial expressions, this tells you visually what is going on in her life, there is no need for dialogue and it was very well done.Overall it's a very engaging, tense, unpredictable and clever movie that is now one of my favourite movies of all time, I love movies like this. Films that have an interesting plot and have incredibly engaging characters. And I love tense movies as well, they are the films that get me the most emotionally involved and this film certainly gets me involved.The only problem with it, is the ending.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Misleading as a Sequel/Follow-up,"I went to see this movie excited and expecting a full-on Cloverfield sequel. I want to warn you, this movie will disappoint in that aspect. As a thriller or horror movie, it's great. If you dislike the jump scares and extreme tension that accompany horror movies, this film is not for you.I left the movie feeling like it was a horror movie with some sci-fi bits tacked on at the end, and I wasn't wrong. The producers admitted the screenplay was originally a horror screenplay titled ""The Cellar"", based off a book (if I'm not mistaken). For some reason, J.J. and his crew decided it should belong to the Cloverfield name. I disagree.Sci-fi horror is great if it makes sense and feels completely within both genres. For all the hemming and hawing about a Cloverfield sequel/follow-up, this was a disappointing answer to the challenge presented by the original director. It truly did not live up to those standards. There are aliens, yes. But in no way could I reconcile the style or unequivocally, the story with its predecessor. This movie should not be marketed with the Cloverfield family, and I am sorry I watched it with those intentions.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Signs meets Misery,"I thought this film was really good, and surprising. For me it was like Misery meets Signs. It had mystery elements, sci-fi, thrills, and even a little horror. This movie really had me on the edge of my seat. I was constantly wondering where it was going, and I could have easily watched another hour of this. I loved how the movie mixed so many different genres together, and it's unpredictability made it a blast.The performances were all great, with John Goodman in particular hitting it out of the park. He goes from likable, to sympathetic, to straight up scary. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was great too, giving her best performance yet. She also proves that she can be a bad-ass Sigourney Weaver type.Overall, I don't have any problems with it, and would recommend.

Overrated,"Not heavily, but arguably a bit, overrated. The plot is boring and predictable, characters aren't portrayed that much in depth and very cliché. ""Two-sided"" story is usually a bad idea, and none of the parts of the story was really interesting. The first movie was arguably better, altho not super great. I guess it is just really not this kind of alien horror that i prefer. Kinda good enough if you don't have anything more rewarding to do, but basically most horror movies are better than this. The ending was very cliché and for me not really satisfying. More background story should have been given to the characters, i felt like i didn't really get to know any one of them.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Worthwhile thriller with a sci fi twist....,"10 Cloverfield Lane in one sense, plays on the Socratic notion of allegory of the cave.What exists beyond the confines of the bunker the key characters of this film find themselves in? Is there anything beyond the bunker, if so, how do you know?Leading on from this, can the heroine of the piece trust her apparent savior who she is forced to share the bunker with? Is he what he appears to be or is he a monster? Is it worth finding out what, if anything, exists beyond the bunker? Does this unknown risk outweigh any perceived risk, her bunker companions may present?This is premise this thriller is built upon and, indeed, for the most part, this film is more thriller, than sci fi. The tension is gradually ratcheted up, as ""what if"" suspicions are raised, dropped and then raised again.This is a well acted film with solid performances by the cast but its in no way an exceptional film. ""Interesting"" is a good way of describing 10 Cloverfield Lane. It engages the viewer in much the same way, as a competently directed and acted ""who dunnit"". You start asking questions and keep watching to see if you can work out where the film is going.To be honest, for the most part, this film is fairly predictable. I'd guessed quite early on what was happening but was caught out, to a degree by the final, final ending. I did not see it coming but, its unlikely anyone would. That said, it is hinted at in the film itself, so keep you ears and mind open as you watch.All in all, a worthwhile thriller with a sci fi twist. Seven out of ten from me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good Goodman,"John Goodman as you have never seen him before. A true believer in conspiracy theories ranging from Russian or Middle Eastern military attacks, to possible invasions from aliens from outer space; it is all here for your consideration. A woman, Michelle(Mary Elizabeth Winstead), leaves her husband and has a car accident, only to awaken in a concrete bunker, shackled to a bed with an i.v. line attached to her arm. Her captor/benefactor, Howard(Goodman), explains to her that America has been attacked by an unknown enemy and that he has saved her life. His bunker has air filters and plenty of stored food for a long stay until after the outside air has cleared enough to leave. Another tenant, Emmett, is another survivor, and together, the three pass the time watching movies and playing parlor games. This is pretty much a three character drama reminiscent of The Twilight Zone. The acting and script are good, but I was not thrilled with the ending. Even so, I would recommend 10 Cloverfield Lane as an above average sci-fi thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

More average than excellent.,I read the movie industry blurb about this movie not really being a sequel to Cloverfield so I went to it not knowing what to expect. Personally I thought that they should have tried to make it more of a sequel to Cloverfield or done something not related to any other films. I found the whole thing a bit gratuitous. John Goodman is always in watchable movies and I think him being caste in this helped it work as a drama-since it can only vaguely be called a science fiction film. What they did is use a background of science fiction to play out an interpersonal drama-which is OK I guess but I think if that is what they were going to do they could have come up with their own science fiction scenario rather than borrowing someone else's idea. I thought there should have been more to it.,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Interesting and suspenseful,"I was expecting a movie more along the lines of the first Cloverfield, with the found-footage filming and more action. But it was pretty different, and in the best way possible. It takes on a more thriller/horror/suspenseful vibe, and is a lot more grounded. The starting sequence made such an excellent use of the title credits, cutting them in between the scenes with moments of silence. The whole movie, you're wondering what's really happening, if the main character is really a bad guy, and what the full story is. The dialogue and acting are superbly done, and it feels real, grounded, mature, and holds your attention. The ending is a great sci-fi ending, and gives the possibility of a sequel (though sadly there never was). A great movie that blends sci-fi, thriller, and horror.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The secret movie,"10 cloverfield Lane is directed by Dan Trachtenberg and stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead, John Goodman, and John Gallagher Jr. First off, we all know that this movie came out of nowhere and they didn't very give us much about the plot. I loved going into this movie knowing nothing. I will say that I enjoyed this movie a lot but it did have small/minor problems. The acting, directing was fantastic by everyone. It was such a small cast but the tension between everyone was done great. John Goodman plays this creepy dude so great. Lots of great scenes with him but who steals the movie is Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She was amazing. She has proved she can carry a whole movie and I hope she gets more roles after this. Now Dan Trachtenberg. This is was his first big time movie and he also knocked it out of the park. Also excited to see what he does next. Now the minor problems I've had with it. The first one is at times the movie slows down, only like once or twice and the other part where I think people will be split is the ending. It ends in an odd way, which some people will like and some won't. For me I was in the middle, it was an okay ending. Overall 10 Cloverfield Lane was a great thriller/mystery with fantastic performances by everyone. Every scene was shot great thanks to Trachtenberg. Only true negative would be the ending, which will leave people split. You should go see it in theaters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
story first,"10 Cloverfield gets right what movies in this genre fail to do, they ignore story while piling on tired predictable dialog and CGI to try and compensate, this is not that movie",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It does the horror genre proud.,"""Don't leave me! You don't know what's out there."" Howard (John Goodman)Everything is out there in this entertaining horror flick called 10 Cloverfield Lane. It has the usual tropes but manages to be surprising at every turn and satisfying at character development. In other words, for a date you couldn't do better with something to please geeks and non geeks alike.Twenty-something Michelle is abducted by Howard, imprisoning her in his survival bunker for not-so-clear motives. He's a fat middle-aged former military guy, and she's an attractive wife who just left her husband. So there's a bit of Room here, what with her confinement and a bland young man as well, Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr.). It doesn't appear to be a sexual kidnapping, for Howard talks about saving her after an accident and the two of them from an alien invasion.You can see my fascination about his scary but complex story because Howard may be lying about the invasion and the polluted atmosphere, or he could be substituting Michelle for his dead daughter. It's enjoyable to try to understand Howard's motives, and it's viscerally a treat to see Michelle empowered like a feminine super hero in her attempts to escape. While Cloverfield Lane is no feminist tract, it has touches of social awareness as it emphasizes her wit, the slower wit of Emmett, and the sharpness of seemingly sluggish Howard.Director Dan Tractenberg and producer J.J. Abrams barely miss a chance to play the jump-scare staple, be it a hand coming up an air duct or a zombie-like woman outside the bunker's window. While devotees of the genre will be delighted by the inclusion of many formulaic elements, the regular audience should just have fun at the scary episodes leading to a somewhat surprising final segment. Or they may simply enjoy watching one of filmdom's best actors, John Goodman. A good man he is, but whether or not the character he portrays is, well, that's up to you.

Much better than expected,"I had reservations about this film - esp. because it seemed like it was done on a lower budget than those big ""hollywood"" tent-pole movies I've become spoiled by.I don't want to say too much about the plot because that's part of the intrigue of the movie ... what's really going on?But THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE! It's wonderful to find a movie that builds tension, suspense, mystery and gets you to question your ideas about what's going on.Plus, the acting is great - and this movie thrives on great performances by the key actors involved. I was always interested in learning what was going to happen next.I'd rate it higher if it had a slightly more polished feel ... but as I said, I've been spoiled by big budget flicks, so don't let it distract you from what I'm saying.If you're looking for a taut suspenseful mystery and are intrigued with the ""J.J.

poor movie,"There were a lot of moments when I thought about creating an account, like when I saw The Holy Mountain. That's 2 hours of my life I'll never get back. Plus all the intellectual damage, no- spiritual damage, it caused of course. And it rates 7.9?!? How many fake the emperor's new clothes arty farty people are there to make that happen? Seriously?Who are you people?Anyhow. I made an account and I'm writing this to tell you all I'm never going to value your ratings again. Because you all went and done it again. Giving this movie 7.6! And that while perfectly good movie have to settle for 6.5 or about. Because of that, everything with a 6.5 or higher get my hopes up for a decent movie. Alas.So let's finish this up quickly because this movie doesn't deserve to much words spent on it. Tedious storyline, lot of cliché's, no imagination. John Goodman at least tries to do some decent acting and has good facial expressions and puts some feeling into his lines. The other dude and the girl... well, as actors I guess they're just trying to do their job -poorly- but it's just *pfff* tedious and - well, what I said- unimaginative. But especially the girl: she's everything you hate in a character in movies like this. She's constantly trying to inadvertently kill herself with her stupidity. A lot of the movie's details are poorly thought through or downright silly and an insult to the audience. Did I already tell you that the story, the plot and climax and all that are all very lame? It's just a poor movie.So whatever, go watch it if you think I'm wrong and all the other people are right. After all, it's rated a 7.6, that's got to mean something, right?

"An amazing movie, don't believe the 1/10 votes!","First I just want to say, don't believe the low ratings, because people just voted zero, when it turned out this is not Cloverfield 2, a scifi movie from 2008. 10 Cloverfield Lane is nothing like it, and it's a good thing it isn't.10 Cloverfield Lane is (like Cloverfield) produced by J. J. Abrams and directed by Dan Trachtenberg. In the main roles we see John Goodman, who's pretty sure a familiar face to many, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, which I recognized from Die Hards as Lucy, and a bit less known John Gallagher Jr.The movie tells about the triple's survival in the doomsday prepper's bunker, but that's pretty much all I want to say about the story. The whole movie is based on that you know nothing about it before-hand. It can seem a bit of a gamble, but trust me on this one - it won't let you down.The movie is simply brilliant. I like the direction and the shaky hand- held camera of Cloverfield is replaced with tripod scenes, which is good. The use of the camera is amazing, and is one the main elements with which they achieved the claustrophobic and exciting atmosphere of the movie.The story is very thrilling and I watched most of the movie not even leaning back, almost literally hanging on the edge of my seat. The story is very unpredictable and to the last minute you are going to rethink whether you are right, or not. The characters are done and portrayed so well, you change your own opinion back and forth all the time.The acting is also great, especially John Goodman does an awesome job as the doomsday prepper and the character is very interesting. Mary Winstead's character is also good, but mostly I liked the actress' job, as it was surprisingly good.I don't really find that much to complain about, and this is one those movies, that when coming closer to the end, you just think to yourself ""no, don't end ever."" It's exciting, with few even scary scenes, and just simply amazing movie to watch. Even though like 80% of the setting is in underground bunker, it doesn't stop or slow down even for once. The pacing is just a notch on, perfect.I rate it 4,5/5 (or 9/10) - simply because I don't want to raise it among the ""best movies in the world"". Though it was great, you can always improved that one bit more. But, I assure this won't be a disappointment, just as long as you don't go in expecting a Cloverfield- like alien movie with constant explosions and special effects, because this one ain't like that.Thanks for reading, and be sure to check more reviews at http://radioaktiivistajatetta-en.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Brilliant as the first,"I loved this. As I loved Cloverfield. Both films take a very convention film idea, and twist it around so it's done in an all new and brilliant way. It's hard writing a review about a film like this, without giving too much away. It's the sort of film you should go into, and know almost nothing about. To get the full effect. I will say John Goodman is in it. And he is as amazing as ever. I will say that if you've seen Cloverfield, and you're expecting a similar film. Then you will be surprised.

Doe-Eyed Die Hard,"Hollywood's latest doe-eyed 'it' girl with the perfect hip to waist ratio, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, brings a little sumpin'sumpin' to the role of distressed damsel.

Winstead's character squirms, limps and leaps her way through the movie. It's fun but Goodman and Winstead are given little to work with in a predictable script.

Old school but works,"From the guy who directed playtest in black mirror, if I knew that before I would never hesitated to watch it. Thanks to positive reviews I did. It starts as an annoying old school psychological horror flick, with a mysterious music to boot hitchhock style. At times too old school, like scenes where a character can't find the right key to open the door to escape and so on. Then things get darker and the horror turns into terror as imagination of the viewer starts to run wild. The ending really messes with your expectations but in the end it works as you weren't hyped in the first place. It's not one of those films that was hyped to be great so you can't help but dread the thought that it might not, or worse it turns out to be the opposite.

From distinguished to disappointing,"Wow, I can't express how disappointed I am with the direction this movie decided to take.It was phenomenally done from the beginning: it had intrigue, a great story setup, a stellar cast who were all highly believable in their roles that made me feel pure anxiety through the screen as I imagined myself in that scenario. The story was unique and built up a great mystery where you didn't know which reality to believe, because both sides were conveyed equally believably. Many theories were possible, so it was pure entertainment to watch. Edge of your seat material.And then... it all fell apart. It decided to take a very cheap route, which was suddenly poorly made (because of the overuse of effects that were also in parts poor quality), and about 27 plot holes and inconsistencies one right after the other. I was so baffled. It was like the last third was hijacked by an excited 15-year-old while the first two parts were philosophical, subtle, nuanced, and slowly built an intensity and intrigue that makes a film good.This could have EASILY been an average 8+ star movie, if it weren't for the lazy overzealous writing at the end. It always disappoints me when writers just don't know when to stop, and no one tells them. But oh well, you win some, you lose some.I'll pretend the last part didn't happen.

There are infinitely better monster films and marginally better found footage films, but I do quite enjoy the film for what it is. 10 Cloverfield Lane on the other hand is a terrific watch, John Goodman delivers an insane performance and I do like that it has it's tie in with the original, quite excited to see if this helps the franchise expand at all. This film came out of nowhere, I had no idea it had even been announced before it was already out in cinemas. I'd recommend not even watching a trailer before going into this one.

A tense atmospheric thriller supported by able cast is possibly let down by an under-cooked payoff that is not worth the wait,"Did it really happen? Is he good? Is the other guy good? Am I still the same person? Too many questions keep popping up throughout the movie without getting much of the answers for most part. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a talented actress and she seems to have found the right balance between off-beat independent cinema and mega-budget studio offerings and this movie actually is a bit of both. The tense atmosphere, terrific acting by its leads, the suspenseful twists along the way kept me quite engaged until it is all undone by a hasty, under-cooked climax that threw all the good work done so far out the window.If the rumors are right, a script about an abduction of a girl followed by imprisonment in a basement (aptly titled 'Cellar') has been modified to have a science fiction twist after JJ Abrams production company Bad Robot acquired it. More rumors try to connect it with 2008's independent hit 'Cloverfield' but I couldn't find where the link was.Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is going through a rough time in her relationship and starts on a road trip alone. She meets with an accident and wakes up in a basement with her legs chained to the wall. Puzzled and scared, she is greeted by Howard (John Goodman) who says that he rescued her from the accident and also the airborne chemical attack that has wiped the population outside. She remains skeptical and when clue after clue unfolds, she understands the true nature of Howard. But is that the only monster she has to fight?The movie starts with a beautiful soundtrack that loops through the first few voiceless minutes and broken by Michelle's accident which is when the story kicks in. The screenplay toys with the audience by giving the same knowledge what Michelle has and letting us think with her and solve the puzzle. Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives a terrific performance as the scared and vulnerable girl who is unsure whether to be grateful to her savior or fight her way out from the abductor. Just when Michelle seems to make a little breakthrough, a highly coincidental incident occurs to put her back in place. So the screenplay could have been a little more smarter there.She is well supported by John Gallagher Jr. playing Emmett who is yet another occupant of the basement and helps her put some thoughts through. They share a warm friendly chemistry especially during the montage when they have to kill the time through board games. But John Goodman's fantastic performance as the temperamental conspiracy nut whose mysterious intentions is what takes the movie to another level. As the screenplay puts clues in strategic places and keeps mounting the suspense, it will only work if there is a huge payoff and there is one - but might not be to the liking of everyone. The genre fusion which is very prevalent these days targeted to reach more audience, might actually be in a little trouble losing out on the actual genre audience.A tense atmospheric thriller supported by able cast is possibly let down by an under-cooked payoff that is not worth the wait.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hidden agenda,"Cloverfield was a found footage movie of a monster loose in New York city.10 Cloverfield Lane is a sideways sequel. The ending ties up with the events of Cloverfield in a sense that this is the same universe and what is happening elsewhere in the USA might have an impact in the character's motives.However this film has more in common with Room or Misery or The disappearance of Alice Creed.Howard (John Goodman) lives in a bunker and also inside is young handyman Emmet (John Gallagher Jr) and Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) a young woman who we see hurriedly packing up some things and then driving off in her car that collided with a vehicle driven by Howard.Michelle wakes up on a mattress and chained to a wall. She is confused and frightened. Howard tells her that he saved her life and everyone in the outside world is dead after some kind of attack and the air outside is toxic.However can Howard be trusted? He has arbitrary rules, he appears volatile, he lacks empathy about Michelle's predicament and sometimes acts more like an abuser.The film is really a claustrophobic thriller as Michelle and Emmett detect inconsistencies in Howard's story and look to escape, but what sort of world is out there?An interesting variation of a franchise where they could had just plodded along the found footage alien invasion plot but it will leave sci fi fans unsatisfied, it is not a horror film in the vein of Hostel or Saw and we saw something similar in Room.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not as bad,10 Cloverfield Lane is a simple and suspenseful film that builds interest by not giving too much away at once. from the beginning I started to make guesses and constantly kept changing it and tweaking them. At one point I was 100% sure of something and then completely doubted it. The film focuses on few characters which helps to better show how the relationship between them develops. The mood suddenly changes through out the movie so there are instances where you get the feel that there is no tension and then it abruptly escalates which kept me interested.I was not sure that I would like it at first because it takes place in a bunker and I assumed that it would be boring but it was not as boring.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Suspenseful and interesting movie in the franchise,"I found this to be a really well-done horror movie to the series. The story is interesting with a woman who wakes up in an underground bunker with two men who insist there's something dangerous up there. I really like the whole mystery over if what Howard said is true or he is just completely insane about what he says throughout the movie. Both statements have a point to them with evidence suggests that either he's true or not. I really like the psychological horrors with Howard acting deranged in current scenes of the movie and the build-up when he's going to snap. Also, I do like how there's people like this where they think the world is going to be in an apocalypse and something bad is going to happen. The movie also build-up towards the characters' relationship, which is done pretty well and is interesting to learn about them. The climax itself is both suspenseful and intense over the things that happened during it. Also, no spoilers are revealed in the movie. There's only three characters in the entire movie, and they work really well. Michelle is the main character who is brought to the bunker due to Howard saying that something is going on up there. I really like the character a lot with her being a smart character and her backstory she said later in the movie that give her some development. Mary Winstead does a great job playing as the character with her, giving her depth and character to her. Howard is the guy who brought her to his bunker and said that there's something going on. While it's a mystery on if he's right or not, I really like John Goodman performance as Howard by making him both interesting and deranged at the same time. He also gives out a lot of interesting dialogue throughout and has somewhat of a backstory to him. Emmett is another guy who lives in the bunker and also helps Howard out. I found him to be a memorable character with his personality and his build-up on realizing that something is suspicious about Howard. John Gallager Jr. Does a great job with his performance as Emmett.10 Cloverfield Lane is a great and interesting movie in the series. I really enjoyed watching this movie and I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Excellent,"I enjoy this movie more every time I watch it.I love claustrophobic horror/thriller movies. This movie does that very well. It tells a great story and keeps you interested with only three characters in a very tight space.The acting is all spot on, especially from MEW and Goodman. Goodman plays a creepy survivalist and does it well. MEW shows a great range of emotion and plays a very strong survivor.I am not sure how much this movie actually connects to Cloverfield, but as a stand alone movie it is excellent.The music is great in this movie also, it leads the mood and emotion of the film. Most movies these days don't have music that stands out at all..it is just there, that's it. The music here sticks with you and is creepy.This is an underrated movie that you should definitely check out.

Terrifically tense thriller,"10 Cloverfield Lane is built on such a brilliant idea which is executed so well.If you've managed to avoid the general synopsis of this film, I'd encourage you to keep it that way and go in as blind as possible. There are so many great twists and turns and shocking reveals that the less you know the better.Suffice to say though that the plot is fantastic. So simple but so well put together. It is tense, clever, mysterious, and a whole lot of fun.There are so many reasons for this. Firstly the cast is limited to only three characters, all of whom are performed to perfection. John Goodman excels in his mysterious role, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a brilliant lead. The writing is superb making the interactions between them so tense and engaging.The setting is spot on for a thriller. It feels claustrophobic and contained and has a terrific tone to the whole piece.In fact, the more I think about this film the more I like it.

"Would Have Been Better as ""The Cellar""","Taking a movie that could have been a good psychological thriller and modifying it to be attached to the Cloverfield universe made it underwhelming. The performances were good and what remained from the original plot was gripping. The mystery of what really happened before the events of the movie, who Goodman's character really was, and how things might have played out would have made for a more enthralling experience. It is disappointing that so many good stories are devalued through forcing them into an existing property.

Suspense. Then some more suspense.,"Wow, finally bought into all the reviews and decided to watch this movie, and by all means it was very good. The acting, the writing, the screenplay, everything was worked out very well and for a movie with such a small scale it was very well shot as well. I felt at times it slightly dragged and I reached for my phone, but quickly put it down as something happened. My only qualm with this movie was that it felt somewhat predictable. And the ending. If the ending didn't include that 1 thing, or if it did but was done better in a not so ""i'm a blockbuster"" sort of way, I would have loved it.Nevertheless, while watching this movie there are several surprises and moments that jump out at you.

Surprisingly good!,This movie starts out rather weak and I nearly stopped it several times during the first 15-20 minutes. I just seemed too rushed and the way the main character sort of adapts to the situation she finds herself in that quickly seemed unrealistic.But do yourself a favor and keep watching. An exciting movie awaits and I really enjoyed it. There are plenty of chocks and nerve wrecking scenes and the twists keeps you sucked in. Also the actors do a great job (besides the first 15-20 minutes).

And although it was short, I can honestly say that the ending was still unexpected and was probably made like that deliberately, so as to set the stage for a sequel.The movie is a perfect example of how quality acting, storytelling and execution from the cast & crew will always beat fancy gimmicks.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Bad Robot takes a thriller movie and tries to market it as a ""Cloverfield"" sequel... strange but good","""10 Cloverfield Lane"" has one shot that references its prequel. That shot is 2 seconds of a street sign. The street is called ""Cloverfield Lane."" That's it. Suffice to say, those hoping that ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a movie that answers all the lingering questions from ""Cloverfield"" are woefully misguided.""Cloverfield"" is a great movie. It's a found footage perspective on an alien monster that destroys New York City. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" drops the found footage thing... and the monster thing as well. Instead, this movie follows a woman named Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who gets in a car accident and wakes up chained to a wall in a doomsday bunker. A mysterious man named Howard (John Goodman) tells her that there has been an attack on the USA and they must stay underground to survive. A younger man, Emmett, (John Gallagher, Jr.) complicates the interpersonal dynamic within the bunker. As time passes, questions arise about all the characters' past lives and what, in fact, is going on outside. Has there been an attack at all, or is Howard holding two people in a cell to live out some sick fantasy he has? The tagline ""Monsters come in many forms"" is perfect for this movie, because its antagonist is not a 100ft tall monster, it's just a man.I'm not sure if this marketing move is genius or stupid... this is a 15 million dollar movie with almost no effects that made more than 100 million dollars. It achieved this by riding on the coattails of a popular movie from a decade ago. If this movie was called ""The Cellar"" (the script's original title) certainly fewer people would have seen it. The good news is people went out and saw a good movie. The bad news is that Bad Robot will probably try to follow up this movie with an out-of-place sequel. At the worst, we end up with a Cloverfield Cinematic Universe. With the name Cloverfield attached to this film, we can also throw any Oscar hopes out the window, as the Academy probably isn't going to take it seriously.Enough with marketing- what makes 10 Cloverfield Lane so good? Well, for starters, the entire movie is tense. Michelle knows nothing when she wakes up from the accident, and neither does the viewer. As Michelle pieces together clues and figures out what is going on in the bunker, the viewer is sleuthing with her every step of the way. The characters in the movie are all smart, and it's fascinating to watch the mind games they play with each other as the mystery unfolds. Nobody, including the viewer, knows who to trust.All the action in the movie is very well set up and executed. Throughout the movie, the purpose of seemingly every item in this small bunker is established to the viewer. When our three characters have an inevitable physical fight, they use their surroundings in very savvy ways that are satisfying to watch.Other than that, the dialogue is written very well. There is a memorable personal scene between Michelle and Emmett in which they talk about their past and their regrets ""pre-apocalypse."" These characters feel human and are fleshed out by the stories they tell.The score is also haunting and the sets are well made and fit with the movie very well. The acting is great from all parties, particularly Goodman, who gives a great performance while the viewer tries to understand his character.Even with the odd marketing, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a must see. It is tense and very well-made from top to bottom. Marketing aside, watch this movie, even if you didn't like Cloverfield.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Psychologically thrilling; wildly feminist; not a sequel,"Firstly, this movie has almost nothing to do with the original Cloverfield. From my understanding, it was a marketing ploy to gain hype and media attention. Apparently, 10 Cloverfield Lane had originally been called The Cellar but was not amassing enough hype. I would not bother watching the original Cloverfield if you have not already seen it. 10 Cloverfield Lane should be regarded as independent from Cloverfield.It can be argued that the two movies take place in the same ""universe""; however, the line is too thin to call this one a sequel.Secondly, it was a great movie overall. It was unpredictable, psychologically thrilling, and uniquely disturbing. John Goodman's character dances along the lines of sanity and insanity throughout the movie which keeps the audience guessing. I understand why Mary Elizabeth Winstead was the first and only choice... the movie couldn't have been done without her.I definitely recommend this to anyone 16+. Although the movie has a ""hard"" PG-13 rating, I would say it could easily have been given the R rating due to intense violence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Stuck Inside A Bunker With The Cloverfield Blues Again,"First off, if you are a fan of John Goodman, this movie is definitely for you. He puts on a bravura performance as an unhinged survivalist that may or may not be telling the truth about the conditions outside the bunker (after some undefined apocalypse) to the two survivors he's basically trapped. Two-thirds of this movie is a character study with very little action but well done if you like that sort of thing, which I do. The ending of the movie has disappointed people, but I thought it was great. Plus, Mary Elizabeth Winstead does her usual fine acting work, so this is a must for her fans.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the few decent movies this year,"What has happened to cinema in 2016? Disappointment after disappointment. It's like Hollywood just doesn't understand what entertains people these days.

Like most people, I had no idea this film was even being made, until a few weeks before its release, and it's a damn fine roller-coaster ride of a movie too.Most of 10 Cloverfield take place in an underground bunker, but the majority of its running time down there is more intense and edge-of-the- seat than Michael Bay/Zak Snyder destroying a hundred cities. A sharp script goes a long way, and is helped by wonderful performances. John Goodman is solid as ever, but it's Mary Elizabeth Winstead's show, and she's brilliant. Vulnerable, yet resourceful, kidnapped, yet refusing to be a victim.Some people complain about the ending, but it is consistent with the tone of the movie, where the rug is always being pulled from under the characters' feet.

I love it!,"10 Cloverfield Lane is a well-crafted, Hitchcockian thriller that unfolds in a precise and calculated manner. The film's score, reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann's work, is a highlight, setting the tone and adding to the tension. The story is presented in an economical yet flawless manner, with interesting characters and a confined setting that keeps the audience engaged. The film is a pot-boiler filled with suspense and riddles, and while the ending feels somewhat studio-driven, it still fits well within the overall sci-fi narrative.The film's sound design is exceptional, adding to the immersive experience. Every sound, from the opening credits to the slightest of gestures, has its own distinct noise or clunk, making the audience recoil at the sound of a metal door. The cast, consisting of John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and John Gallagher Jr., is remarkable, with each actor delivering a standout performance. Goodman's portrayal of the integral character is particularly terrifying, bringing a sense of respect and anguish to the role.Overall, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a gripping film that relies on suspenseful editing and alarming pacing to keep the audience on the edge of their seats.

Same goes for the directing really. Nothing that really blows me away or immerses me to a greater level.The overall story... I liked it.

10 Cloverfield Lane: Film Review Updated,"Released back in 2016, the thriller 10 Cloverfield Lane is the sequel to the ""found footage"" horror/thriller film Cloverfield. This film focuses on both brand-new characters, and location, from the first film. This film centers on protagonist Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) after experiencing a traffic collision, and unexpectedly finds herself in a bunker. The owner of the said bunker is an intimidating character named Howard (John Goodman) who not only saves Michelle but tells her the outside is now dangerous for travel. Also inside the bunker is Emmet (John Gallagher Jr) who helps Michelle adjust to life inside the bunker. Stuck in an unknown environment, along with unknown people, Michelle must figure out how to trust the people around her and avoid danger from the outside world. If there is any danger outside the bunker.Off the bat, 90-95% of this film takes place inside a doomsday bunker. Most certainly a change of scenery from the first movie, which took place all around New York City. This film is also shot traditionally instead of the shaky camera seen in the ""found footage"" genre. Thinking about this now, I like the change of scenery. The story becomes more tense considering the intensity of Howard's character and the uncertainty you feel with the character of Michelle. Having limited access to the world outside the bunker forces you to trust Howard, even though his whole persona tells you otherwise. The acting performances throughout the film are excellent and help the viewer get lost inside the story until the final moments of the film.I expected a more direct connection to the first film and maybe more explanation of why everything is happening. However, after a second re-watch, I appreciate this film more. I must admit also, I like this film better than the first. Having been shot differently, and not depending on CGI in most scenes, I was able to absorb the story at a slower pace and better appreciate the climax of this film. Not every question about the world of Cloverfield is answered in this film because the characters within the world don't understand what is happening either. Honestly, that's ok.Overall, this is a solid thriller that is worth re-watching. The look of the film is well done with the lighting and cinematography. The runtime is also just right at one hour and forty-three minutes. I enjoyed watching this film again and having the opportunity to change my opinion on this film as well.

"A good movie that has no need of carrying the name ""Cloverfield"", because it stands fine on its one","In ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" we meet Michelle. She get's involved into a car accident, but when she wakes up, she is not in her car or in an hospital, she now is in a bunker. Here there are two guys, one of whom is the owner of the bunker, who claimes that the air outside is not breathable anymore. Now she has to find out if it is true, or that the man is just insane...This is the directorial debut of Dan Trachtenberg. And hats of to him. He was a really good director. You may think that the movie would become boring after a while, due to the movie being set underground for a very big part, but Dan Trachtenberg made sure it didn't. He used different shots to keep you interested and he also took different directions each time. When there was dialogue you could be sure that you would see an alternation of different shots. This was done good, and kept you from getting bored. He is also a very good visual director. Lot's of the shots looked very nice. Especially the outside shots, here he had more room to work with and he used it, to accentuate that she now was outside and not in a small space anymore. That's why there were also a lot of close-ups in the scenes inside the bunker, to show the claustrophobia. This I found clever. The cinematography was done very good too which only complimented the directing. The cinematographer of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" was Jeff Cuttr. The soundtrack was also very well chosen. The soundtrack made the intense scenes only more intense and the faster editing also helped with this. The songs where people in sang were also very good. The make-up design was surprisingly good. I say surprisingly, because I thought that this was going to be a low budget film. The wounds looked realistic and were not nice to look at.The acting was very good. The cast was small, but filled with good actors. There was one person that surprised me a lot and this was also the main actress of the movie. This is of course Mary Elizabet Winstead, who played Michelle. I only have seen Winstead play bad characters or in movies where she just acted bad, but in this movie it is not the case. This was by far her best performance yet. She did well in the emotional scenes and also in the scenes just based on her facial expressions. She might have been good, but her co-worker overshadowed her. This was John Goodman. He was really good. Grom him I've seen a couple of movies and he was good in all of them, it just seems he is getting better by the years. He was threatening and intimidating. His unpredictable character only made it better. The last person on the list is Emmett. He was the other guy in the bunker. Emmet was played by John Gallagher Jr. He wasn't as special as the previous two, but he nonetheless gave a good performance.The writing was the problem with this movie. Everything of the script was fine but the ending. The ending was way to abrupt and the tone switch wasn't handled well. The whole movie had an isolated, thrilling feel, but when she got out the tones rapidly changed. The ending was also dumb and kind of predictable. This was my main problem with the movie. The dumb ending. That's why my grade changed from a 9.5 to an 8.5. The dialogue was very well and carefully written, the dialogue fitted with the characters who said them. Which brings me to the next subject, the characters. These where well developed. Each one of them, which is very rare in today's movies. John Goodmans character I found the best. His character was the most interesting and intriguing. He was unpredictable, like I've said, but this was only one more thing to make his character interesting. The character of Mary Elizabeth Winstead was smart also something that you don't see a lot in movies these days, and also very likable. Emmett did undergo a character arc at the end, which was very good and well handled. I think by now you can see my surprise for the bad ending. Everything from the script was done so well and with care and at the end they just gave up or something. A smaller problem that I have with the screenplay is that you are still left with some questions, but I think that they did this intentionally, so you can think about the movie even after you've seen it. This is an acceptable excuse, but for some questions I think they didn't give you enough hints, or evidence. I also have no clue why the movie carries ""Cloverfield"" in the title, because it has nothing to do with that movie at all.In the end I would say that ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" was a good movie, one of the better movies I've seen that came out in 2016. Just the ending ruined it for me and that's why I'm giving this movie a 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Great writing and fantastic acting make this a film worth watching,I went to the movie knowing very little about it and I was very impressed. This is one of the best movies I have seen in quite some time and it is Trachtenberg's first feature film. Great writing and fantastic acting make this a film worth watching. I believe this is some of John Goodman's best acting to date. I won't say much to avoid any spoilers but I will say that this film keeps you guessing. The character development makes you care about what happens throughout the film and the location gives off a sense of claustrophobia that I have seldom felt in a movie. Go see this movie!

Intense and uncomfortable. A must see.,"You know that uneasy feeling you get when driving alone at night? Particularly down a street you're not familiar with or through a neighborhood that is foreign to you? Something just feels off. Usually it's all in your head. You're just getting a bit paranoid for no reason. Have you ever felt like someone was watching you? The hair on your arms stands up, the slow churning queasy feeling in the pit of your stomach suddenly becomes apparent, you have to keep looking behind you even though there is never anything there you just have to because what if? Those feelings are 10 Cloverfield Lane.10 Cloverfield Lane is about the end of the world, or so that is the perception John Goodman's Howard gives us. He has built a doomsday bunker stockpiled with enough supplies to last for years. After Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Michelle is involved in an automobile accident he brings her to his bunker. This is all you need to know plot wise. Do yourself a favor and see this with knowing as little as possible about it.10 Cloverfield Lane takes it's viewers on an uneasy and wholly uncomfortable journey. It slithers along at a rather brisk pace while getting darker, grimmer, and more unnerving with each passing moment. Every time you think you have it figured out it throws a new seedy wrench into your theory. John Goodman's Howard conspiracy theorist who doesn't seem right in the head. You know the term a few screws loose? This guy never had those screws to begin with. Goodman's remarkable turn as Howard is another excellent proof of his immense talent. He's paranoid, terrifying, likable, and completely unsettling. This is not a man you would ever want to meet.Mary Elizabeth Winstead follows up her unbelievable all-time level performance in Faults with yet another simply brilliant performance here. With those two along with Smashed and Alex Of Venice she is quickly becoming one of the most versatile young actresses around. She plays Michelle with a fierce tenderness. Two descriptions that should not go hand in hand, but she accomplishes this feat in outstanding fashion. She creates a fully realized person here. At times it is easy to forget she is even playing a character. Her pain, sorrow, fear, conviction are all expressed amazingly and easily believed. She lives in this film and this film breathes life because of her.John Gallagher Jr. delivers quite the beauty of a performance himself, however I'm not going to speak much on his character. I feel it's better that way.Dan Trachtenberg has already shown is technical prowess with his Portal short. Here he expands himself to glorious results. There is no doubt he was the right man for this job. He lets his actors grow, and he aptly builds a very intense and very horrifying world around them. He keeps the pace smooth while keeping a frantic feel to it all. The mood he constructs here is an edge of your seat, close your eyes, and don't look down thrill. I am already eagerly anticipating his next work.2016 has it's first must see of the year. This taut and mysterious thriller manages to keep the tension at an all time high and it's viewers guessing for it's duration. Even despite the obvious alluding it's title lends this film will keep your mind turning. The final 15 minutes are guaranteed to lead to very different feelings, but for me they couldn't have been done better. It is those last moments that truly solidified this as an absolute masterwork. Do not miss this one.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Who is the real monster ..?,"First of all, this is NOT a Cloverfield sequel, but it's way better ! Furthermore, 10 Cloverfield Lane a story that has a perfect runtime (1h43) – no moments are uninteresting or boring, and there is no predictable moments. At no points it slow down or lose interest. For a 5 million budget, this shows that the success of a movie, is not made by explosion or a lot of special effects, its made by a good well written story, intense, and good actors as well. The dialogue is really good, also due to fantastic execution from its cast.J.J. Abrams Produce it, and did a clever move to name it 10 Cloverfield Lane, Dan Trachtenberg directed it, and for his first official movie, we can be certain that we will hear his name again.The three man cast - Mary Elizabeth Winstead, John Gallagher Jr. and the one and only John Goodman,in what may just be one of his finest performances in more recent years, Goodman did an amazing performance that I hope will be recognize by the Academy Award next year. The two other were good as well, and deserve to be notice. The only thing I like less was maybe the end, like the 15 last minutes of the movie, but its still a great movie nonethelessAll in all, it has an intriguing premise, brilliant performances and good storyline. It puts you on the edge of your seat for all the movie. Good Thriller, Drama, mystery and sci-fi. I strongly suggest you to watch this movie. Buying it at full price won't make you disappointed !!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A psychological exercise in thrill,"A follow up to 2008's ""Cloverfield"", this film was originally not a sequel and in my opinion works just as well on its own.The story follows Michelle, who seems to be running from her problems. After being involved in a violent accident (or, was it?) on a dark road, she wakes up in an underground cellar, chained to the wall. Enter a masterfully creepy John Goodman who claims that the apocalypse is upon us, and he is doing her a service by allowing her to stay in his doomsday bunker. Things aren't as clear as all that.The technical elements are well-done, but to be expected in a J.J. Abrams film. It is not, however, Michael Bay on one extreme, and it's not Steven Spielberg. The scenes flow together in a way that keeps us hooked and guessing the entire time. The cinematography can feel claustrophobic, and purposefully so. Ultimately, it all comes together effectively.I have not seen the first Cloverfield film yet, so I will wait out of fairness to compare the two. I can say based off of what I know of the 2008 film, that this is more of an anthology than a sequel. It works beautifully as a stand alone, but for fans expecting a monster masher, this will disappoint. It's a psychological guessing game and a character study of 3 different people more than anything else.The ending, which I will not spoil, is unpredictable and kept at arms length until the the last 10-15 minutes of the film at which point it hits you head on. While unpredictable, some may look back and see that it's obvious what was coming, but that should not diminish the experience during the film.This film is a masterpiece of suspense, I was literally on the edge of my seat from the first 5 minutes. Although lighthearted moments are employed, these only serve to add to the feeling of fear and the knowledge of the coming dread, whatever form that takes. During such scenes, I was not able to sit back and relax; I was preparing myself for what I knew was lying in wait.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
What was expected and this I got !!,"Cloverfield being a good hit, I was eager to watch thriller 10 Cloverfield Lane. The movie was good at the beginning but lost its path under the ground where the cast was situated. There was very less of horror and no mystery. The movie was somewhat predictable however the cast tried to manage the act. I didn't like the plot of the film and neither the cinematography. There were very less dialogues and I was in a thinking that I was watching a silent movie. The trailer was promising but the movie disappointed me. The critics liked the movie for its twisted plot, however I think it was predictable and there was no twist in the movie. I wasn't thinking the movie to be loose. I would give 2/5 for this movie.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
If It Wasn't For the Ending... Masterpiece.,"10 Cloverfield Lane was an outstanding piece of work, great directorial debut, it is actually hard to believe that is his first film. It was so methodical, and structured with key elements and plot points that were necessary for the film's advancement without clichés. I can see now why critics were saying this movie was a bit reminiscent of Hitchcock films. Side note, you would only know what they (critics) meant, if you actually watched more than just Psycho, Vertigo, or Birds.I truly did not expect to like the film as much as did... I do say like, however, as opposed to love because of the film's ending. 10 Cloverfield Lane's buildup is absolutely phenomenal, but after the lead actress escapes the clutches of the crazed kidnapper, the conclusion feels outrageously out of place, out of tune, and really just didn't flow well with the rest of the film. Even Winstead's character has a moment of negative disbelief ""Come On."" Now, this being the supposed sequel to CLOVERFIELD (2009) I expected it to be absolutely awful because the first film was found footage. Cloverfield (2009), if it had utilized great cinematography the way this film did, that movie could have possibly been a spectacle for the monster movie genre, or just much better than it was, in my opinion, but I absolutely detest shaky cam and even more-so found footage films. Also, the first film contained mostly improvisation from the main characters, whereas this one had a very solid script, that gave a depth to each character, rather than just ""OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD!"" and the annoying incessant shrieking of the woman in the first film ""JASON! JASON! JASON!"" UGH! This sequel is a huge step up in quality overall.Even though the film had a bad moment, the negative aspect of this film cannot compare to everything it did right. The acting was a marvel to behold, I can see why Mary Elizabeth Winstead was the first and only choice for this film, I could not see anyone else playing her character better than she did. Same goes for Jon Goodman. Emmett's character could've been written a bit better but otherwise, solid casting. Also, the small cast worked so well because of the first one's need to give the viewers a scope of the destruction through the first person point of view whereas this one focuses more on the aftermath of the first film while also adding to it, in an unconventional way. I can easily say that this is going to be another film I can add to my favorites, and I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for something good to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Unique !!,"5 minutes into 10 Cloverfield Lane...no dialogues. Just background music. I had to check whether I left Youtube running in the background.. :-D. The images and background just did not connect. 10 minutes into the movie..What is this? Another Saw? 15 minutes into the movie..wait!!Another Joseph Fritzl. But from then on 10 Cloverfield Lane is just unique. With its twits and turns, it confidently manages to stand apart from the pantheon of Sci-fi movies...its artsy. It will remind you of the ""war of the worlds""..But in the end it is unique. A brave movie. 8/10.(The less you know about this movie...the better)",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Excellent addition,"For me Cloverfield is an amazing movie (it's in my top 100 movies) so this had a lot to live up to,This is the second time watching 10 Cloverfield Lane, the first time I watched it at the cinema enjoying every second of a 'Misery - 1990 movie' type story unfolded,by the end of the film I had mixed emotions, one being 'wow that was great' and two thinking 'what has that got to do with the first movie' as I was expecting a massive monster, but still left the cinema thinking it was a great movie but I had lots of questions,Watching this the second time and having some of the questions answered I sat back and enjoyed the great story and the awesome acting from Winstead, she absolutely nailed her character as did Goodman.Well worth a watch",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Sublime,"This is my all-time favourite movie. I still remember the day I watched it in the cinema. It's incredible how such a small cast can keep you so engaged throughout. I was on the edge of my seat watching this. You are left guessing throughout the movie whether Goodman's character is lying or telling the truth, and the end result is completely unpredictable, original and thrilling. Winstead's lead is also incredible, you are rooting for her throughout the entirety of the movie. Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Stunning,"Well, I don't think I've come out of a film with a face as white as a sheet for a long time, but 10 Cloverfield Lane really did exactly that. An exceptionally well-directed film that's full of mystery, twists and chilling suspense, this film is incredibly enthralling at almost every moment.And that's even more impressive when you take into account that this whole film basically takes place on one set. There's a little set-up outside the bunker for the first five minutes or so (five minutes that instantly prove what an amazing film this is going to be), but apart from that, 10 Cloverfield Lane is one of the most claustrophobic and intense thrillers in years.I thought Dan Trachtenberg's directing here was fantastic. He manages to keep the rather slow-paced story that unfolds in this confined space brilliantly fascinating, and as the film gradually reveals small morsels of information about what's really going on, he increases the tension fantastically, keeping you right on the edge of your seat until the bitter end.What's more is that the performances were stunning. Only three actors appear in this film throughout, but they're all amazing. In the lead role, Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives what is easily her best performance ever, full of deep fear, dread and confusion, whilst John Gallagher Jr. impresses in the smallest role. However, it's John Goodman that really stands out. He's brilliant as the man who runs the ship below ground in the bunker. Unpredictable at every moment, sometimes appearing comforting and honest, and sometimes being genuinely terrifying, but what's most impressive is that he's always thrilling to watch.The plot is the most interesting part of this film to talk about and discuss afterwards. The film, unlike its predecessor, the big monster movie Cloverfield, is a calm, collected psychological thriller. It's all about the desperation to discover whether this woman has really been rescued from a devastating attack, or if there's something more sinister going on. Believe me, there's no way to tell which way it's leaning in this film, but that's testament to how well-written, directed and acted it is, and by the end, you'll be biting your nails, hanging off the edge of your seat, hiding behind the sofa and all that as the film snowballs to an astonishing (albeit undoubtedly controversial) conclusion.I won't say anything about the ending, apart from the fact that I loved it. I can see some people being confused about how this film finishes, but I was blown away by both the plot direction and the sudden shift in tone, and that was what really stunned me to the point where I felt so scared.Overall, I loved 10 Cloverfield Lane. It's not your average thriller, but something deeply more intelligent and dark. It's an exceptionally thrilling watch, and with three brilliant performances, a stunningly unpredictable plot and amazing directing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Well made psychological thriller... but tenuously related to Cloverfield,"Initially starting life out as a script titled ""The Cellar"", this inherited the title of Cloverfield after JJ Abrams' Bad Robot Productions became involved in the project. Even with the title though, the best way to approach this movie though is as a companion piece to the 2008 film rather than a traditional sequel or an of spin off.The directorial debut of Dan Trachtenberg finds Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) waking-up in an underground bunker after a car accident. With her Howard (John Goodman), who she believes is her captor but he insists is Michelle's saviour as he brought her underground to protect her from the catastrophic event which has laid waste to humanity above. Also with her is Emmett (John Gallagher Jr), who believes in Howard's story of desolation. It is essentially a three-man cast and all are on top-form; in particular John Goodman, who uses his large frame in a claustrophobic setting to create menace rather than crossing the line into over-acting. The scenes are tense throughout as relationship between Michelle and Howard alternates from trust and distrust.There are elements of Duncan Jones' ""Moon"" in this, in that we don't know whether we can trust the machine or person who has the most information. There also comparisons to JJ Abrams' TV series ""Lost"", particularly the first season finale where we were left to wonder what was inside the bunker, but this time in reverse.The film's denouement is a slight letdown and feels oddly out of place in the context of the piece. It felt like the ending to a different film than to the one just seen. No matter, the real drama is in the interactions between the three characters in the bunker and it is this which makes it an enjoyable spectacle.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"NOT related to ""Cloverfield"", but still worth seeing","Don't be fooled by the film's title - it is in no way related to ""Cloverfield."" You can't even call it a ""blood relative"" (as some reviewers have done), because they're both very different movies. If you go in expecting a sequel or tie-in, you'll be disappointed. I'd wager the only reason they share titles was to attract more viewers.That said, this movie is an entertaining little sci-fi thriller that uses a ""less is more"" approach. Don't expect a lot of jump scares or action on the level of ""Cloverfield"". Rather, expect a constant sense of tension and danger. My main gripe with this movie is the ending, which I think could have been written WAY better, and somehow just didn't fit with the rest of the movie.However, the best part of this movie is John Goodman's performance. As someone who's used to seeing him in more ""good guy"" roles, his role here was very refreshing, and he nailed it to perfection.

"Tense, and Unpredictable","10 Cloverfield Lane had a few appealing features, but didn't seem as though it was poised to be as good as it was. Seeing the trailer the film looked odd, as it was a sequel to a found-footage disaster movie that was set in one location amongst only 3 characters. 10 Cloverfield Lane is tensely confining, well-written, and takes the franchise in a totally different direction. That being said this film could have been great if it had not been part of the cloverfield franchise, however it also did well within that universe.The film is very tense, similar to last year's Room, in that it's very confining and isolated. The film benefits from good performances all around, but most notably that of John Goodman who plays the sympathetic yet deranged Howard. Goodman's cold yet soft performance helps build tension as the character clearly controls the situation, but is unpredictable and often erratic. With a brilliantly dark and somewhat nightmarish tone, the film plays out like a human version of mice in a rigged maze.The story in the film is unpredictable and very well written, most likely due to the fact that ""Whiplash"" writer and director Damien Chazelle co-wrote the script. The story unfolds with one twist after another, with each twist bigger than the last, until the film builds into its climax perfectly. Another element that was very well done was the character development, as each character is well-rounded, and given a good arc. With a good story and great characters 10 Cloverfield Lane is a well-written sequel to Cloverfield, that even improves upon its predecessor.One thing to note, while it may seem obvious, 10 Cloverfield Lane is very different from Cloverfield. Where Cloverfield was a found-footage disaster film with a huge scope, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a very confined traditionally shot thriller about people trapped in a bunker. That being said fans of the original may not be as fond of 10 Cloverfield Lane, whereas some who disliked Cloverfield may enjoy 10 Cloverfield Lane. However, they are very different films, with 10 Cloverfield Lane more focused on character development, and drama.In the end, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a well crafted thriller, that delivers, mostly due to great writing. The film is very tense, well-acted, well-written,unpredictable, and very different from its predecessor in size and scope. The end result is a great film that is in many ways better than the original Cloverfield, because of the effort and care of the people making it. For those that love tense thrillers, or just in general great films, this film will surely entertain.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Chilling, tension-filled spiritual successor to Cloverfield","It was 2008 when Matt Reeves and producer J.J Abrams blow audiences away with their found-footage hit 'Cloverfield, a film that reignited the found footage genre. This year, first-time director Dan Trachtenburg brings us a supposed sequel that was kept a secret for quite some time before finally making its way on the media. Embracing on a solid technical scale and a gripping atmosphere, this spiritual successor formulates a whole new direction while concealing a relation with its predecessor. Instead of fostering a cast of characters fighting to survive against on a terrifying, large scale disaster orchestrated by a giant monster the size of Godzilla, this film sizes down on a trio of characters confined one single room. The film stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle, a young woman leaving her home to escape from an ill relationship with her boyfriend. On the road, Michelle is unexpectedly injured in a car accident and thrown off the road. She wakes up in an underground bunker sheltered by an old farm owner Howard (played by John Goodman) and his bearded colleague Emmett (played by John Gallagher Jr.) who vows to protect her from the widespread terror of what he believes is a doomsday event that lies in the outside world. Before too long, Howard's strange behavior leaves her questioning whether she is safe, or has just stepped foot in another bad situation.This film is not quite everything you may expect from watching the trailer. Unlike the first film, the found footage style is not used as this film takes place primarily inside the bunker. So the setting is designed to give viewers a genuine sense of claustrophobia, and it definitely suites the tone of the story. And with the decent cinematography, sound editing, and the typical J.J Abrams-style visuals setting the picture, viewers are blessed with some well crafted scenes from the start to end. The film progresses through plenty of scenes gleaming with powerful suspense and palpable tension that dares to leave viewers holding their breaths and leaning at the edge of their seats. These scenes embrace such a tense, heart-pounding atmosphere enough to keep viewers engaged with the characters and story. Nearly every scene is unpredictable. From near beginning to end, it becomes a terrifying showcase where you almost frequently have to remind yourself you're not one who is trapped in that confined space. While the pacing is slow at some spots, it builds up to its gripping climax at the end where the story's connection with its predecessor begins to shine a little light. Mary Elizabeth pulls off her role as the main character, but the biggest gem comes from John Goodman playing Howard, a performance so strong, if appropriately terriyfing it keeps the story moving. John Gallagher Jr. is pretty decent here as well. These actors excel at making their characters believable in every sense.10 Cloverfield Lane is a fantastic spiritual successor to 2008's Cloverfield, and probably one of the best suspense thrillers to be released in a while. This movie is very well shot with sweet cinematography, nicely directed for a first-time filmmaker, and brings grueling suspense to keep viewers at the edge of their seats. It should come to no surprise that there are some notable connections to the original Cloverfield, but I'm not gonna give them away. Overall, even if you haven't seen the 2008 film, this film is still worth an experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of the most tense and thrilling movies ever!,"Prepare for one hell of an experience when you go to see this movie.As you probably have heard or read by now, this is not a sequel to 2008's Cloverfield. 10 Cloverfield Lane is its own original story but does have some certain familiar elements. Like Cloverfield, this film really holds back on spectacle. In fact, the spectacle does not really happen until the final act. But what makes 10 Cloverfield Lane its own thing is the psychological thrill and tensions it creates in a small confined space.Where Cloverfield was shown through a camera lens with the action being based on how the characters react to the destruction and chaos, 10 Cloverfield Lane's action is based how the film's lead Michelle decides on what to strategically do next. And it is though her, we explore the film's compact but yet also big story. From the beginning of the film, it strongly uses tiny visuals to tell this complex, psychological mystery with little clues that requires your eyes's utmost attention. And the more you learn, the more you begin to question whether the interior of the bunker with this seemingly crazy man or the outside world that may have been destroyed by an unknown threat is more dangerous.Much like how Matt Reeves broke out with the original Cloverfield, the same can be said for Dan Trachtenberg. He carefully builds up tension within scenes that can have no music but makes your heart as background sounds the tiny echoes, ticking clock and to loud rumbles. Trachtenberg has created this very rich but yet claustrophobic world within this bunker that the majority of the film takes place in. Would not be surprised be if Trachtenberg gets offered to work on any future Marvel, DC or Star Wars projects.But the key to this film's success are its perfect performance by the only three leads. Mary Elizabeth Winstead proves that she should be more recognized by now as she shows that her character Michelle is no damsel in distress. Winstead shows wide combination of intelligence, fear and emotional damage. Much like Matt Damon in The Martian, she proves to be very resourceful throughout the plot. She shows this great arc of her character going from being emotionally vulnerable to a MacGyver survivalist and ultimately ending up as the next Sarah Conner or Ellen Ripley. And the ultimate contrast to that is John Goodman's paranoid and terrifying Howard. This is by fay the most creepy and scary performance I have seen of John Goodman. From his intimidating physicality and creeping, suspicious stare, Goodman perfectly plays this character as someone who forcefully tries to stay in command and has strong trust issues. But Goodman does show there is a hint of a soft side to Howard which makes you wonder if he is telling the truth or not at times. John Gallagher Jr. also serves well as the ally to Michelle and comedic relief. His performance helps you to become greatly attached to his character.Many may complain that final act will feel tonally inconsistent with the rest of the movie but I felt it was a great payoff to everything that Michelle goes through and helps to complete her arc.10 Cloverfield Lane is not Cloverfield 2 and nor should it be. In terms of storytelling, it is a far more superior then the original Cloverfield. And the tension and scary sounds is only enhanced when you see it in Imax. I would recommend seeing this movie sooner rather then later to avoid someone spoiling it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Solid story for the most part but suffers from the Cinematic Universe Continuity,"I really liked the main premise and 95% of the film. It had great actors and a solid script and premise.

"Decent, but not great","I read several reviews before going in to this movie last night. Most reviewers gave it an average of 9 out of 10, so I was expecting nothing less than pretty close to perfect.

"Do more horror, Mr. Goodman.","I think this movie deserves to be judged on its own merits rather than what one thinks a Cloverfield sequel ought to look like.John Goodman is formidable as doomer having his time to shine and who is king of his castle. One doesn't know what to believe as we carefully consider our options along with the heroin.Tense, well paced and not without a sense of humour that doesn't detract from this tension, I would say this is superior to the first movie. So many little things in it work: ""I want us to be one big happy family""....chills...A lot of people condemned the ""ending"" meaning the climax. I liked the climax but I won't ruin it.The real ending (final 30 seconds) annoyed me but I've been more ticked off.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
What just happened?,"One of those movies that builds and builds, then derails into a WTF ending.

10 Cloverfield Lane,"This movie upsets me. It's so great for around 90% of it yet there are little things here and there, but it's an exceptional movie all the same.

J.J. Abrams has done it again!!,"10 Cloverfield Lane has raised the bar for suspense. This movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I was anxiously engaged in the movie and concerned for the characters. In watching this movie I found myself cheering when something good happened and stunned when things took a turn for the worse. I was trying to figure out if I was in a theater or a sports arena rooting for my team at times. The story will keep you guessing, in awe, and confused from start to finish. The story is a weird one and your opinion of the situation will change throughout the movie. The unpredictability is probably the best factor of the movie. This film will make you wanna lean in, be attentive, and sometimes even reach out to grab someone or something. This isn't a movie you want to wait for. Go see it today and if possible before it leaves theater's.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I'm now a 'Cloverfield Convert!',"A few years ago, 'Cloverfield' was released. If you missed it, it was one of those 'found footage' films where everything is shot by the point of view of one really annoying character who won't put the camera down no matter how much danger comes their way. Sorry, I digress. I really don't like the 'found footage' genre. I find it cheap, annoying and just downright implausible. It was because of this that – despite 'Cloverfield' being a massive hit, I hated it. A giant Godzilla-like alien monster started rampaging through a major U.S. city and the story was about a small band of survivors fleeing the area. One of them had to film the hold experience because I don't know. I just remember getting really frustrated with the film because he wouldn't stop filming even when his leg was being eaten by little monsters. Anyway, it was because of that which meant I wasn't that bothered about seeing this sequel. Only it's not a sequel. Or is it? For a start it's not 'found footage' any more (hooray!) and we meet a girl who gets into a bad car accident on the way home. She's dragged from the wreckage by good ol' John Goodman who takes her home and they live happily ever after. Only joking. He's actually a paranoid nut-job who built a 'perfect' survival bunker just in case the world should happen to end and he wanted to go on living. So, our heroine wakes up there, injured and a little frightened. Especially as Mr Goodman won't let her leave. The closest she gets is the reinforced steel door where she can look out over the stricken world. Only it's not that stricken. It looks quite normal, but Goodman swears that there's enough fallout out there to nuke a cockroach from the inside out. So, she's trapped, with no idea what's happened. Can she get out? Should she, even if she could? Anyway, because most people have either seen, or are aware of, the first movie with the giant monster etc, we assume something bad has indeed happened to the rest of the world. Only this film doesn't really follow on from the original 'Cloverfield.' So, the longer it goes on, you wonder whether you're actually watching a sequel at all, or another film that has sort of piggybacked off its name/fame and has created something different all together. 'Cloverfield' was a big budget monster/horror movie whereas '10 Cloverfield Lane' is small, low budget and confined to the bunker for the whole time.And, in my opinion, it's the superior movie by far. John Goodman is excellent as the paranoid nutter who is probably the last person you want to be stuck on Earth with and you're rooting for our heroine to escape (assuming there's a world left to escape to!). It's more psychological horror than giant-monsters-crushing-New-York-horror and it's all the better for it. I hear that some people weren't too keen on the ending, but, even if you hate it, you should hopefully enjoy the preceding 90% enough to just ignore the very last few scenes. I wouldn't watch Cloverfield again, but I'd definitely watch this in a few years time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Incredible sci-fi thriller,"Even though it stumbles when it connects to the greater universe in its final moments, 10 Cloverfield Lane is an incredible thriller that delivers more than enough tension, dread and genuinely shocking moments in smart and cleverly set up ways.Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives an incredible lead performance, a strong and likeable protagonist who anchors everything. John Goodman is absolutely terrifying in one of his all time best roles that plays to his imposing strengths. John Gallagher Jr. Is a solid comic relief who isn't overused.Dan Trachtenberg's direction is excellent, creating a constantly claustrophobic environment that never lets up and utilises some inventive camera angles. The music by Bear McCreary is a lot more prominent than expected but that only helps to increase the tension and stakes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Something certainly did come, but it was just like ""there it is"", and then done","I'm not really sure how many critics and audiences found this movie so profound. The suspense and the mysteriousness was pretty well produced, but I just wasn't all that satisfied at the end. Overall it felt almost cliché to me to be honest. Speaking of the well produced mysteriousness, the scenes and cuts were well mixed together. There were also a couple unpredictable and questionable moments that kept you thinking and engaged throughout most of the film before the main incident. Splendid acting like so and a well clever mix of suspense and thrill, but the overall story was not too satisfying to me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Surpasses its predecessor, in every way.","10 Cloverfield Lane tells the story of three people, taking shelter in a bunker, several feet below the ground. After meeting with a minor car accident, Michelle(Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is rescued by a man named, Howard(John Goodman). Michelle wakes up in a bunker, underground. Howard tells her that the world has been decimated by widespread chemicals in the air. He tells her that the bunker is the only place with clean air, & that it's not safe outside. She soon finds another man in the bunker named, Emmett(John Gallagher Jr.). Michelle soon realizes that, something is fishy & Howard may not be telling her the truth.10 Cloverfield Lane is an outstanding film. Before going for this film, the audience needs to know something. This movie hardly has any connection with Cloverfield(2008), aside from the title. What this movie is, is a superbly crafted suspense thriller. Director Dan Trachtenberg excels in his directorial debut. You just can't predict how this movie is going to end. It keeps you guessing, even after the credits start to roll. The reason this movie is so good, is because it is carried by its three leads. John Goodman is the star of the show, as Howard. You just can't guess the motives of Goodman's gray character. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is spectacular as Michelle. Winstead masterfully portrays Michelle's growing anxiety & fear. John Gallagher Jr. is superb as Emmett. Gallagher Jr. provides some much needed comic relief, in the movie. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a must watch, for fans of Cloverfield(2008) & newcomers alike. I promise you won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Too bad about the ending.,"An unstable John Goodman or hostile aliens? Let me think about it... again. Locked in a underground bunker with an unstable John Goodman or on the surface trying to keep one step ahead of hostile aliens? Talk about being caught between a rock and a hard place. After much consideration you might take the chance with the latter threat, after you realise just how intense a game of charades can be.""10 CLOVERFIELD LANE"" is a confined and agonising character driven thriller that cleverly feeds off the uncertainty of the situation and the interplay of its characters. Working in its favour is how they filmed it, like you're actually riding it out in the bunker alongside those inside. Feeling every sense of emotions streaming from the trio. Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr really do hold you there with very good performances. Both their characters are adapt and affably brought across. But you just can't go passed the powerhouse acting of John Goodman. It's a tailored performance of pure manipulation and embodying unease. As for the last 10 minutes, it was serviceable but disappointing compared to the impressive build-up that had gone before it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
You are now free to move about the bunker,"""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a unique specimen in 2016; here's a film that comes out on the heels of very little marketing buzz, so much so that only a sentence-long plot synopsis was made known to the public, minimalist trailers that, unlike most, do not air before every new release in theaters, and a week of screenings that have had many critics tight-lipped about what the film actually is. When I first heard the film was going to be released, I had to try not to shrug it off and assume it would be a mediocre, loosely connected followup to the 2008 smash hit ""Cloverfield"" that's main goal was quick cash.However, after the thirty minute mark of the film, I knew I was in for anything but a cash-in, let alone a film that was trying to be a followup or a continuation of the world set forth by the aforementioned film. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" not only takes the series into an alternate direction, but completely revitalizes its formula by creating a Hitchcockian-style mystery that is predicated upon heart-racing tension and immaculate aesthetics that are often so crisp and consuming, you might have to remind yourself that you're not the one trapped in the film.Being that ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is one of those films where, when describing it, there is a vague line between what is spoiler territory and what is part of the basic plot outline. To keep things decidedly simple, the story opens with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), driving home on a long, secluded road after a fight with her boyfriend, before she is involved in a devastating car accident that sends her flying off the side of the road. She eventually wakes up in an underground bunker and meets Howard (John Goodman), a dedicated survivalist, who rescued her from the wreck and claims that this is the safest place she can be following ""what happened.""Howard informs her that a devastating attack has taken place outside that has left nearly everyone dead or contaminated with some sort of disease; the size, scale, and cause of the destruction is unknown due to the radio-tower being knocked out. In preparation for an event like this, Howard has taken the precaution of designing this underground bunker like a home, with a shower, toilet, Television set, a full kitchen, and food supplies to last years if rationed. Also in the bunker with them is Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr.), a friend of Howard's who remembers when he was constructing this bunker. Howard will also not let Michelle nor Emmett look onto the outside world through windows without his permission, leaving the three without any contact beyond the walls of the bunker.This kind of premise just breeds claustrophobia and fear and ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a masterclass example of such. Using some fascinating cinematographical tricks (employed by Jeff Cutter) that showcase the cramped environment of the bunker, in addition to some beautiful, sweeping long-shots in such a tight space, both Cutter and first-time director Dan Trachtenberg create an environment that startles and mystifies. The trio of screenwriters (Josh Campbell, Matt Stuecken, and Damien Chazelle, writer and director of the fantastic ""Whiplash"") are smart to keep us, the audience, just as trapped as the characters in this film. We don't know more than they do and we're put in a position to buy or reject Howard's simultaneously incredulous but believable story of doomsday.In addition, the sound design in this film is layered and cut-throat, not so much heavy on the jump-scares or the abrupt synthesizers that work for a good jolt, but in terms of adding to such a congested area where every sound is ostensibly amplified to ear-shattering effect. This makes every effect and auditory accoutrement to ""10 Cloverfield Lane""'s beautiful cinematography resonate that much more, and makes for a slowburn, suspense-driven delight.Finally, let's please talk about John Goodman's career-making performance in the film, as he broods but never settles for empty fear. His gravelly, almost guttural voice makes each syllable that rolls of his tongue feel like a sucker-punch to the jaw, and such a blow lands right on the exterior of Mary Elisabeth Winstead, who is anything but a passive force of abuse in this film. Winstead's strength and power as a leading woman is communicated throughout the film, and she proves to a public that has slept on her despite strong performances in ""Grindhouse: Death Proof"" and ""Smashed"" that she's worthy of recognition. Only more likely to be slept on her is Gallagher, Jr., who does some damn-fine work as well, but sort of finds himself ostracized by the sheer power of both Goodman and Winstead.Again, I must emphasize the fact that ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a proclaimed ""spiritual successor"" and ""blood relative"" to ""Cloverfield"" and not a direct sequel, prequel, or any immediately connected entity. This is probably for the best, as the pulse-pounding effects of ""Cloverfield""'s found footage/shaky camera aesthetic have worn threadbare within the last eight years since the genre's revival. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" goes for something different, more electric, layered, and scary, and the film manages to be one of the best mysteries in recent years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The unknown,"I went into this show not expecting much so it's no wonder why i feel some type of way once it was all said and done. John Goodman is a great actor, no doubt about it. The characters fed off of his presence in every scene.All it took was good acting to bring this sub par mediocre plot alive then dead then alive again until the end. Sigh.I could spend time pointing out all the films mistakes and questions but i would rather not. Instead lets the appreciate the unknown, the very element that carried this film in the first place. Its a 7/10 because i can't rrmeber the last time i felt unsafe leaving a movie theatre without John Goodmans permission.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It really has nothing to do with the first Cloverfield,"I read reviews saying this had nothing to do with the first Cloverfield movie but I still wanted to watch the first one first, in case there was some link to it. Nope, this can be viewed as a standalone movie entirely so I have no idea why they had to use 'Cloverfield' in the name.. And it is a superior movie; I would make it an 8/10 if it weren't for the ending, which if not bad per se is definitely not on par with the rest of the movie. More psychological thriller than sci-fi with fantastic acting; I guess when you have only 3 actors in your movie, even with a small budget you can afford good ones.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Nothing Shaky About This,"Dan Trachtenberg and J.J. Abrams are either absolute geniuses, or contemptuous trolls. Because, by calling the film 10 Cloverfield Lane, they duped all of social media into thinking that this was a sequel to the 2008 found-footage monster movie, Cloverfield. Boy, did they get you all good. I'd give this a spoiler alert, but as a cinephile, I know better, and so should all of you. I sniffed out the ""hype"" culture surrounding this film from the minute it dropped unexpectedly online.But a film being ""overhyped"" is certainly not the same thing as a film being bad, disappointing, or even just O.K. 10 Cloverfield Lane turns out to be better than anyone thought it was going to be. This is a brilliant return-to-form for the psychological thriller genre. I was reminded the whole time of Misery. What I mean is, it's a film that freaks you out, without ever being gory and overly stylized. This film never jumps through hoops to scare you, and yet it's lack of effort scares you even more. Films like this used to be made much more often, but that was a time when films weren't made for profit. I guess that's the reason as to why they named it 10 Cloverfield Lane. They knew it was a great film, but they had to make sure it made money.. by attaching Cloverfield to it. Sure, it's lame, but at least a whole new audience can have a whole new appreciation for the psychological thriller!My praise goes straight to John Goodman. It feels like a decade since we last saw him on screen, or at least that's what it seems, because I'm wondering to myself, where has this guy been? He's one of the great actors. He is electrifying in this. He's a monster, and no, I don't mean the kind that destroyed Manhattan in the 2008 film. We never know what he's about, why he's so crazed, and how much he was fabricating the truth about the situation he put our main character in, but the film keeps us guessing. In the end, we aren't given all the answers, and neither were we given a ""gotcha"" style ending, that would've left the audience howling, as expected. But that's the charm of this film. Sometimes, less is more, and less isn't at all what hype surrounding this movie wanted you to think. Yet, here we are, we all ended up seeing a great film, and that's all that matters.I left the theater pretty satisfied, and pretty entertained. Might I say, so far, 2016 has been an awesome year at the movies, and if it keeps up, I'm going to have a blast.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A fantastic spin on an existing franchise, backed by amazing performances","10 Cloverfield Lane is a Drama / Mystery Thriller that is a standalone film and a spin off to 2008's Cloverfield. I have not seen Cloverfield but i have heard quite a bit about it since its release 8 years ago. But really, you don't need to know a thing about Cloverfield to see this film. If you have seen Cloverfield then i guess you kinda know what you are dealing with here, but if you haven't seen the film, this spin off is a fantastic standalone film that i can tell you had my full uninterrupted attention. This was a fantastic movie that was intense, dramatic, and had a tinge of humour thrown in there, i was completely engaged and on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was very well crafted in many departments and was backed by three absolutely perfect performances.The pacing of this film was pretty much perfect for most of the film, it slowly builds to some big moments and when not much is happening, it keeps you in the film with a clever use of music and a creepy score. There was a 5-10 minute section of the film in the middle that did start to drag but it quickly moved along to some more juicy material. I gotta also note that the dialogue in this film was on point. It is so easy to write cheesy dialogue that is clearly just actors reading off a script, but they managed to have really interesting dialogue so that you completely buy into the conversations they are having. The 3 main characters are also very grounded and fully fleshed out, and that was done amazingly in a short amount of time, getting it out of the way quickly. You really learn to love these characters or love to hate them, and that is because of the great writing in the film. But it is also down to the 3, absolutely fantastic performances leading this film.Mary Elizabeth Winstead, John Goodman, and John Gallagher Jr. were just downright amazing in this film and were 110% committed to their roles. Winstead and Goodman in particular elevated this film so much with their performances, it would not have been anywhere near as good with anyone else. The back and forth between those two made the film so much more intense and dramatic and added a lot of weight to certain parts of the film. The visual style of the film and the cinematography are also something to note because it was beautiful. The way the film was shot in this bunker made every scene a little bit more appealing to watch. It won't be winning any awards but it was a surprising highlight of the film.8.3/10So, VERY MINOR spoilers ahead (NOTHING PLOT RELATED)One last thing that i absolutely have to talk about is the amazing way in which this film handled being part of an existing franchise but at the same time being its own thing, and how this could be the beginning of a revolution in filmmaking regarding spinoffs and standalone films. As you may already know, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a spin off from 2008's Cloverfield and unlike other spinoffs it wasn't concerned with trying to connect itself to the universe every 5-10 minutes. It just went and did its own thing, told its own story whilst still being in the same world. Really, if you didn't know it was connected to Cloverfield going in, you won't walk away being confused and left 'out of the loop'. This film very much stands completely on its own and isn't restricted by having to conform to what the previous film set for it.This is the PERFECT way to create new and interesting ideas within a franchise to avoid becoming repetitive to the point where no-one is interested in the franchise anymore. Look at the genre's of these two films for example, Cloverfield was an Action/Adventure/Horror filmed as a found footage film, and this is a Drama/Mystery Thriller that took the franchise in a completely new direction. I still haven't seen Cloverfield but i want to see more standalone films set in this same world to see what they can do to change it up every time. I can only hope that more franchises see the success of this film and introduce similar ideas within their worlds. The only thing i think would stand in the way of this becoming a common sight in Hollywood is if a studio tries it and completely messes it up that will turn off other studios from trying it. But i hope that doesn't happen and we get more films that take a similar approach to this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I was worried there - for a bit!,"Let me start by telling you that I love Mary Winstead. I also really, really enjoyed the previous 'found footage' Cloverfield. It was a fun movie that gets you invested in the characters quickly and does not disappoint with the action and the effects. So, you can imagine why I was worried about the fate of this film. I wanted it to be as good, if not better than the original - a feeling I shared with Prometheus.It starts off well enough and moves into familiar territory for anyone who has seen the trailers. The movie does what the trailer promises. It builds an atmosphere that switches back and forth between oppressive and relaxed, and then back again so quickly that you get whiplash!! Fun!!It follows our strong leading lady and we are happy to go along with her. The script seems to be well written with no extra words or actors talking aloud unnecessarily just to explain what happened. I like that. But, the exclamations are there when they feel feasible. I would have probably said the same things.The plot moves, builds, and takes off a little predictably, but it is still done well enough to have me heaving a sigh or relief.10 Cloverfield Lane is a fitting prequel.

"A brilliant, brilliant horror/thriller film.","NO SPOILERS,So. 10 Cloverfield Lane was a brilliant, brilliant horror/thriller film. The way the whole movie was always very tense, and very gripping was superb. The movie does take a lot of risks, but it always pays off. The film uses paranoia and claustrophobia to taunt you, and then rounds it up with very good jump-scares. One jump-scare in particular shocked me (I wont say what it was, but it is at the beginning,) and actually made me scream! How this is a PG13 I have no idea as it is very scary, and very very gory. But it doesn't overdo in the squirm factor. The ending was very abrupt, and it did feel like they were trying to piece two films together. The ending did feel a bit out of place but it ended the movie very well; unfortunately, leaving some questions behind. Overall, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a brilliant and terrifying film.

extremely original and expertly constructed thriller,"I was caught off guard and really surprised at just how good this film is. After a fast and puzzling beginning we are thrust within the confines of an underground bunker, more or less, for the duration of the film - and that's good. There are surprises throughout but the fact that a sensationally good film can be made with a small cast and limited locations should not be one of them. Tight, believable and always second guessing the viewer, this is a most impressive thriller. I cannot remember another film that has caught me by surprise or had be as tense for a long time. John Goodman is not just good but sensationally so as he flips back and forth in manner and has us as caught off guard as the other protagonists. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a revelation and clearly set for great things. Much is seen through her eyes and she reflects our concern and confusion interrupted with sudden bursts of action and innovation that startle. We can never relax and whenever we are tempted to and feel we have the measure of things, we are confounded with further action. John Gallagher Jr is more or less the foil for the other two but does well and his seeming lack of contribution is deceptive as his early lack of overt action against their captor adds to our confusion as to whether Mr Goodman is a goodie or a baddie in this extremely original and expertly constructed thriller. As a postscript I would add that the innovative ending does not disappoint Full marks.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Tense Thriller, but fails to keep itself restrained, thus losing plausibility","'10 Cloverfield Lane' is about a woman held captive because her captor is convinced he's protecting her from a virus outside. She meets another man there, who's also being held captive. Throughout the movie, you're wondering whether the captor's insane, or if he's protecting them from a lethal disease outside.It's a movie that invites comparisons. I'd personally compare it to 'Take Shelter', a film about a man who predicts a storm and hides him family in a bomb shelter, but throughout it's never clear whether he's right or if he's just imagining it. Another comparison is 'Misery', a story about a man being held captive who attempts to escape.It's a tense, scary and gripping thriller focusing on their attempts to escape and uncover the truth about their captor. John Goodman who plays the captor, is fierce and intimidating, not a guy to be messed with. When the other two characters attempt to mess with his plans, this creates for great conflict and tension.There's a subplot about a dead relative of the captor, which leads to interesting mystery investigation, but doesn't get fully developed.Toward the end, it jumps the shark, forgetting to keep itself restrained, and gets a bit over the top, losing its plausibility.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Way Better Than It's Predecessor.,"To be honest, I didn't know this film was a sequel to the film ""Cloverfield"". I know these two films have similar titles but I guess I didn't put two and two together. From what I can remember from ""Cloverfield"", ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" was a little better. ""10 Cloverfield Lane didn't really rely on huge special effects, breath taking CGI and jumping out of your seat scares to maintain an interesting story. The story-line and plot of this film was constructed on pure suspense, drama, and mystery. In a lot of ways that can be scarier than having an actual alien or monster in the film and that's what made this film what it was, also it takes a talented writer to write a tense and suspenseful story that takes place in one small confined area for at least 95% of the film. This film fits right up there with ""Locke"", ""Phone Booth"", and ""Wrecked"". With the mystery of John Goodman's character, Howard, the two other sheltered or captive individuals, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr., have to wonder rather or not to trust the man that ""rescued"" them and that's basically what the plot is but from that a powerful story emerges.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"If you're into psychological thrillers, you will love this","I absolutely enjoyed this one. As a person who has seen many thrillers/horrors I found 10 Cloverfield Lane refreshing and surprising. It tells the story of a young girl who gets in a car accident after fighting with her fiancé. when she wakes up she finds herself locked up in a man's underground shelter, a man who later on claims the world outside is no longer what it was. during the movie, which most of it is set in one location, the viewer experiences the emotions and thoughts of the main character, collecting information with her and tried to understand what the truth really is. the main actors are great and the directing is also wonderful. it keeps you on the edge of your seat and doesn't let you get to one conclusion. i can understand why people didn't like the ending, since it felt like it came out of nowhere, not really adjusted to the films genre. but personally, i thought it was mind blowing. if you like mystery and are open minded, watch this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

10 Cloverfield Lane is an interesting sci-fi thriller with a thrilling screenplay.,"10 Cloverfield Lane (2016): Cloverfield, which was released in 2008 was a surprise hit and introduced alien invasion in found footage style.It really impressed me a lot with a lot of tense moments.This year 10 Cloverfield Lane, which is loosely related to Cloverfield released with good expectations.So how is it?? Plot: Soon after leaving her fiancé Michelle (Mary Elizabeth) is involved in a car accident. She awakens to find herself sharing an underground bunker with Howard (John Goodman) and Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.). Has she been saved from an apocalyptical event as Howard & Emmett tell her or are there other motives for her being held against her will? Plus Points: 1)Performances: This movie has amazing performances by all three actors.Mary Elizabeth and Goodman have excelled in their roles with award winning performance. 2)Screenplay: This movie has tense screenplay even though it is set in a bunker for 90% of the movie.The movie enters serious mode from the first scene itself and it never falls down at any point. 3)Climax : Climax has good twist which really thrills us a lot.It was handled very well.

"""People are strange creatures. You can't always convince them that safety is in their best interest.""","I was conflicted as to whether to categorize this film as a psychological horror-thriller or a monster flick (probably more to the former). The film was very much hyped back then (partly due to the viral marketing strategy employed); a long-awaited sequel to its critically-lauded predecessor,Cloverfield (2008). Instead, we got a remarkable quasi-sequel.WHAT I LIKE: The atmosphere of the film was so intense and suspenseful; it doesn't really have any dull moments. There were twists at every turn; when you think you know it all, you actually don't. It kept you guessing right till the very end; is there really a catastrophic gas attack on the American soil? Or are they just kidnapped by a deranged old man? Or maybe there is more to it than meets the eye.WHAT I DISLIKE: I was geared up for an all-out monster flick, but I was bombarded with a gripping survivalist tale.

A Very Decent Cloverfield Spin-Off,"10 Cloverfield Lane is a tense thriller carried by great performances from John Goodman & Mary Elizabeth Winstead. This isn't really a sequel to 2008's Cloverfield though; more like a spin-off, with a different story taking place in a different part of the world. While Cloverfield jumped onto a current trend at that time (""found footage""), this film feels more old-fashioned in style.Dan Trachtenberg's film is less visually engaging than it could have been, but this is solid entertainment, a film meant to keep you guessing before it throws you back into the world to argue about its ending. The sense of uneasiness you get at times is certainly there in the script, but it's Goodman's performance that makes your skin crawl. He captures a man on the edge of sanity for whom control is key. He's not an obvious maniac, but someone who honestly thinks he's a savior. Goodman keeps us guessing, allowing glimpses of the possibly kind man that Howard used to be.In terms of performance, Winstead matches Goodman in every way. She helps carry carry 10 Cloverfield Lane, conveying Michelle's conflicted feelings about her predicament and staying completely in the moment that the tension remains.The final 30 minutes of the movie is pretty much going to dominate conversation. Without spoiling anything, it's a series of events in which Michelle finds new challenges around every corner, and while I'm not sure it's as solid as it could have been, Winstead and the filmmakers keep it working through sheer confidence.The visuals this time around aren't as overwhelming as they are in Cloverfield, but that can just reiterate the point that a film doesn't need to be laden with special effects to be any good. Investing in decent performances & story can be more key to making a film enjoyable than relying on amazing visuals.10 Cloverfield lane is definitely worth a watch and it's nice to take a break from the usual ""found footage"" Horror/Thrillers that seem to dominate at times.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Had Potential to be a really good movie,"To me, the movie seemed to have two story-lines. The first one is about this man that seems to be nice, but the others discovered a dark secret of his.

"A Thrilling, Tense and Intimate Film,","10 Cloverfield Lane is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. It's a very intimate two hours as the majority of the film takes place within a shed, as a man locks two people up, claiming that there has been a chemical attack. I was kept at the edge of my seat throughout wondering if this man was telling the truth, or if he had kidnapped these two.I did find the ending disappointing, a big finale was building up from the moment Michelle enters that shed, and then it all wraps up in a way that I found very underwhelming, I was anticipating more and it is the reason I am giving this an eight instead of a nine.The cast is fantastic, consisting of mainly only three people. John Gallgher Jr. was well able to deliver both comedic and dramatic moments, while Mary Elizabeth Winstead shines in a very mysterious, intriguing role. However, the highlight has to be John Goodman, who is absolutely terrifying as Howard, a character who clearly has ulterior motives that he refuses to reveal, I have always been a fan of Goodman as an actor, but never knew he could do threatening so well.It takes as much advantage as it possibly can with its tight, intimate space, creating an atmosphere that is always tense. Thrilling and unique, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or thriller.Following a car accident, a young girl is trapped beneath a man's shed, who claims he is protecting her from a chemical attack, she is determined to discover the truth.Best Performance: John Goodman",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

First-time director Dan Trachtenberg knows what your expectations are, and he uses that knowledge to subvert the genre in new directions.

Well Put Together,"This movie was intelligently done and it had to be considering the setting.

The bunker belongs to her captor, Howard (John Goodman), and he is trying to convince her that he has her there for her own good. Is he telling the truth or is he not? There are indicators that he is but then there are indicators that he is a nut case as well.It is an intense movie.

In fact, it's better than he said it was.A lot of peril arises in movies like this one from characters making dumb decisions. Everything that happens in this movie happens in an organic way and all of the characters are intelligent! This is especially the case with Goodman's character and Winstead's character. There were several moments in the film where I was thinking to myself, ""That's so smart!"" Which is definitely a credit to the writers of this movie.Speaking of the writing, one of the highlights of this movie is the dialogue. It was Tarantino level great!In addition to the characters being intelligent, they're all distinct and interesting. And from the opening scene I immediately started caring about Winstead's character.And there were numerous subtleties. Like when you see the thimble on the desk. And the shirt in the picture.The cinematography is fantastic! There are a lot of nice long takes, God's view shots, and slow reveals.It's incredibly atmospheric.The tension is ... wow.The score was super well-done and I did a great job at setting the tone and building the tension.All of the acting was phenomenal especially from Windstead and Goodman. This is probably my favorite performance from Goodman and definitely a nice turn for him. He usually plays those gentle giant characters but in this he is a creepy and scary dude. I love it when a villain can intimidate me.A lot of detail went into the making of this underground bunker. Hats off to the production designers!The director of this movie, Trachtenberg, really knows what he's doing and it shows, and not just in this movie! It shows it in the episodes of The Boys that he directed. He does an amazing job with building up an atmosphere and creating tension.

10 Trachtenfieldberg Lane,"Firstly, this movie is an amazing start for the director Dan Trachtenburg, and I am sure that the intriguing script played an integral part in this success. Although I did not going into this movie completely blind, as I may have seen 1 trailer, I was not expecting what happened in the movie, and for that I am pleasantly surprised. The biggest mistake on my part was that I almost did not see this movie, so I am constantly reminded of the perks of being a manager at a movie theater when I have some time to kill. Now that i have seen this movie however, I would say it is definitely worth your time and money. Please give the plot a chance if you have not seen CLOVERFIELD the movie, as it will only bring a better sense of what is going on, and is not essential to follow the story. If you are into character driven stories then this film is for you, and if you were expecting a big budget horror film because of the reference to the first film, you may want to pass. All I can say is that this movie is very realistic in that when HUGE events are happening in certain movies, there are other smaller stories occurring during the same timeline, and this movie is a product of one of those COUNTLESS stories. OVERALL GREAT MOVIE AND GREAT IDEA FOR ONE.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Shocking Conclusion,"The story is intriguing from the very beginning of the movie. What I liked the most in general is that you have no clue what will happen next. I quickly noticed a resemblance with the story of series Wayward Pines. The accident, life saved by a stranger, suspicious intentions, incomprehensible circumstances... You just put yourself in the same position and it does not feel comfortable. It is hard to trust anyone and you feel curious about the life outside the borders. How could we ever know what is it like to lose everything we had and to be forced to forget about everything we know about our world in only a matter of hours? I must confess that I am a bit disappointed with the ending, probably because I am not really into Mystery and Sci-Fi. Anyways, it didn't ruin the whole story, it just made it a lot more interesting to think about and surely a lot more shocking.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Vidiot Reviews...,"10 Cloverfield LaneHere's a helpful handyman tip: why not turn that old bomb shelter into a contemporary sex- dungeon?Or, like, the doomsday prepper is this psychological-thriller: keep stocking it with preserves.Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) comes to after a car accident to fine she is confined in an underground bunker curated by conspiracy nut Howard (John Goodman), who believes the air above is now contaminated from an unknown attacker.Remaining distrustful of her captor while building a rapport with him, Michelle conspires with her co-inmate (John Gallagher, Jr.) on constructing a homemade HAZMAT suit for escaping in.On one hand it's an intimate and exhilarating cat-and-mouse game with sporadic bursts of humor and malice. And on the other, it's an out-of-left-field alien incursion sequel to the 2008 found-footage Cloverfield. But some how these two conflicting narratives work in an unanticipated fashion.Ironically, to aliens, underground bunkers are like cans of preserved peaches.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"This is tremendously entertaining, keeps you guessing the entire time and is tense without trying to be","""There's been an attack. I'm not sure if its chemical or nuclear but down here we're safe."" Michelle (Winstead) has just broken up with her boyfriend and is driving away trying to decide what to do with her life when she gets hit by a car. When she wakes up she is chained to a bed in a tiny room with no idea where she is. After Howard (Goodman) explains he is trying to save her from the devastation of the outside world she isn't sure what to believe. Now Michelle and fellow captive Emmett must decide if risking the possibly dangerous outside world is safer than staying with Howard. I was not looking forward to seeing this at all. I did not like the original movie at all and was expecting more of the same. I couldn't not have been more wrong. This movie takes place after the attacks of the first movie, but the style is totally different. First (and best) the movie is not a found-footage type thing. That is a huge plus. This is tremendously entertaining, keeps you guessing the entire time and is tense without trying to be. If you are avoiding watching this because of the original don't worry. This is much much better. When it ended I was actually hoping it would keep going. This is one of, if not the biggest surprise movies of the year for me. I highly recommend this.

A glimpse into a possible apocalypse!!,"First things first, you have to keep an open mind about this movie. The good thing about it was that it wasn't so hyped up and not a lot of people have heard about it, but it's definitely one that's making a lot of noise right now with the exceptionally high rating and well deserved positive reviews. It will give you the chills, and there are moments that take you completely by surprise and will keep you on the edge of your seat for much of the movie. This is definitely a classic and a very good example of exceptional cinematography as there is very rarely any CGI and special effects.

An Effective Psychological Thriller That Falls Apart in it's Climax,"First off, despite what the title may lead you to believe, this film has absolutely nothing to do with the original Cloverfield. Even calling it a ""blood relative"" as J.J. Abrahms has called it is stretching it.Despite this, 10 Cloverfield Lane is able to stand on it's own for the most part. I won't go into too much detail as it's a film that's best to go into knowing as little as possible, but this is one of the closest examples of a modern-like Hitchcock film that I can think of. First time director Dan Trachtenberg demonstrates that he has a promising career ahead of him being able to create an extremely claustrophobic, creepy, and tense atmosphere that will keep viewers on the edge of their seat. It's less than 5 minutes into the film before the films grabs you and doesn't let you go until close before the credits roll. The plot is simple, yet intriguing and becomes more and more unsettling with each reveal. The performances are also a big reason this movie works as well as it does, in particular John Goodman who steals the show.Unfortunately, the films takes a nosedive in it's last 15-20 minutes. Without spoiling anything, it takes a strange direction and suddenly becomes something incredibly campy and silly in the worst way possible. I felt like I was watching a completely different movie. It doesn't ruin the complete experience, but it certainly leaves a sour taste in your mouth as the credits roll.If it hadn't been for the ending, I would have easily given this an 8, possibly even a 9. But because of it's overall impact on the film, I have no choice but to give it a 7. Still, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a rare film that manages to be simple, yet riveting. It's a shame that it has to drop the ball in the third act or else this could have possibly been one of the best films of the year. Despite this, the pro's still outweigh the con's heavily and it's a film that I highly recommend checking out. Just make sure to have your expectations in the right place beforehand.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

An Intensely Terrifying Thrill Ride,"I just watched the film ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" and I have to say, it was absolutely terrifying! I would give it a 9 out of 10 rating for its spine-chilling atmosphere and gripping storyline.The film revolves around a young woman named Michelle who finds herself trapped in an underground bunker with a man named Howard. Howard insists that a hostile event has occurred, rendering the surface of the Earth uninhabitable. As the story progresses, Michelle becomes increasingly suspicious of Howard's motives and begins to question whether or not she can trust him.The tension in this film is palpable from start to finish. The claustrophobic setting of the bunker adds to the sense of unease, and the audience is constantly left on the edge of their seats, wondering what will happen next. The film does an excellent job of building suspense and keeping viewers guessing throughout.One of the standout aspects of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is the phenomenal performances by the cast. Mary Elizabeth Winstead delivers a captivating portrayal of Michelle, capturing the character's fear, determination, and resilience. John Goodman, who plays Howard, is absolutely brilliant in his role. He brings a sense of unpredictability and menace to the character, making him both terrifying and intriguing to watch.The film also excels in its storytelling. The plot is well-crafted and keeps the audience engaged from start to finish. It takes unexpected twists and turns, keeping viewers guessing and adding to the overall sense of dread. The pacing is excellent, with just the right amount of slow-burning tension and intense moments.Furthermore, the cinematography and sound design in ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" are top-notch. The dark and claustrophobic visuals perfectly complement the film's eerie atmosphere, and the sound design adds to the overall sense of unease. The combination of these elements creates a truly immersive and unsettling viewing experience.However, I have to deduct one point from my rating due to a minor flaw in the film. Without giving away any spoilers, there is a particular plot twist towards the end that some viewers may find divisive. While I personally found it to be an interesting and thought-provoking addition to the story, I can understand why it may not resonate with everyone.Overall, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a must-watch for fans of psychological thrillers and suspenseful cinema. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you with a lingering sense of unease. The performances, storytelling, and atmosphere all come together to create a truly terrifying experience.

Superb!,"10 Cloverfield Lane is a 2016 Hollywood movie directed by Dan Trachtenberg. The movie is about a man who saves a girl who was in an accident. He lets her stay in his bunker to save her from the alien attack. But his behavior makes her uncomfortable.With a runtime of 1 hour and 45 minutes, this movie will cling on to your attention till the very last scene. Every transition in the scenes are smooth and you won't doubt anything or will doubt as much as Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) does. The unsettling atmosphere of the bunker which lightens up a bit at times and then again gets tensed will keep you on the edge of your seat. Also, Michelle's constant planning to get out of the bunker to check the outside world for herself will keep you guessing about the alien attack.John Goodman as the survival specialist and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the ever-sceptical girl are a treat to watch. Also the soundtrack is apt and engaging.Lastly, do watch it! You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Tension in the bunker,"This Cloverfield sequel feels mostly like a spin-off story and at first it's hard to relate to the previous movie until, near the end, it seems to give a few hints about what the creature that terrorized the town really was. The film is mostly a suspense story with a post-apocalyptic tinge. It's pretty simple, but it's an acceptable movie. Having only 3 actors as protagonists, the film knew how to tell a short and fulfilled story with them. Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman are the best of the movie taking all the attention. Also, here it plays a little with whether Howard is insane or telling the truth and leaves several possibilities open. 10 Cloverfield Lane, more than being a sequel, is a fairly simple spin off that manages to do its thing. My rating for this movie is 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The two main cast members performed quite well, however the other male character in the bunker named Emmett was kind of annoying. Plus, there were other flaws that I couldn't quite overlook (like how Michelle found the exact right keys to use at the exact right time when trying to escape through the door, poorly planned means of escaping earlier by setting the air duct on fire and possibly putting her own life at risk by suffocating, etc.). Nevertheless, the film was intense and gripping overall and left me creeped out which meant it did its job well!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Wonderful acting, great direction","10 Cloverfield LaneI am a fan of John Goodman. From The Big Lebowski, Argo all the way to Speed Racer. Goodman shows that he can go full into a character and make the audience forget that he was Dan Conner in Roseanne. He plays a prepper with almost stereotypical military experience who saves the female main character: Michelle.Michelle is played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead who you might remember from Scott Pilgrim vs. the World or maybe the 2011 rendition of The Thing. She is probably one of my favorite young actresses and is completely underrated as one.Emmett plays the third wheel to the John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead show. Acted by John Gallagher Jr. and I couldn't put my finger on who he was because of the major beard he had going for this movie. He does an okay but nothing special performance. To see how good he can act, watch a TV show called The Newsroom.I'd never heard of Dan Trachtenberg until this movie but with JJ Abrams producing his film I could only assume there was faith involved and with almost zero promotion it wanted to go on merit alone and maybe word of mouth. The direction was great, sometimes the lack of music allowed for more suspense actually.Verdict: Great suspense. Little things matter, pay attention. Dan Trachtenberg has a great road ahead.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
John Goodman excellence in Saw esque turned Independence day,"The first thing we see is the main character Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) supposedly running of from her boyfriend, when suddenly she ends up in a car crash. The crash itself seemed unnatural, and for some reason they decided to have the title flash in the middle of it, twice. It didn't start off on the right foot. But after that it seemed to find leverage.One thing we see is a resemblance to the first Saw movie, only one room and the main character chained up. It has promise. At first, the scenes seem much too extended and that didn't contain any excitement. But this changed the further we went into it. The lines and delivery are just about enough to keep the scenes interesting, but the main thing that brings turmoil is the content of what they're saying. The story in this movie is a unique one indeed.When a movie is made, solely focused on one room, you need dramatic things to happen, in a good way. This movie does just that. The story keeps unraveling as we go on, and turns out to be more and more breathtaking the deeper we go. The balance between action and calmness is also great, where there isn't more gore and activity than necessary. It is also the little things that builds up the different happenings, making for an aggressive expansion that thrills the viewer with excitement.The conclusion is set to be a big and horrifying twist to the tale, that would have been a perfect ending to a otherwise brilliant movie. Instead they ruined it. The ending seemed rushed and unscripted, like they ran out of time and just threw something in. It was just plain weird and turned this great film into a cheap action movie.Characterwise, they were not that interesting. Except for Goodman's Howard. Mystery surrounds him, is he telling the truth, or is he serial killer performing his frequent ritual? Well, for all the engaging depth of the character, it ended up ruined, all by the ending. It took away all the things during the movie that built up his intriguing character. However, Goodman's performance is not to be overshadowed here. He is surprisingly great as psycopath serial killer/crazy conspiracy theorist, deliviring a fenomenal performance. His acting is superior to the rest of the small cast, and he is truly over qualified for this movie, though he brings a very important piece to it.
In my opinion, Goodman is one of the most underrated actors of our generation, and deserves more praise.When it comes together, as The Beatles sang, this movie is filled with thrilling events in a horrifying story, but is totally ruined by the ending. It was a bigger anti-climax than biting into a juicy red apple only to find out it was made of plastic. Shame.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A high tension chamber piece anchored by three strong leads,"In New Orelans, Louisiana, a young woman named Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has left her fiancé following a fight. When Michelle has a collision on a rural road she is rendered unconscious and awakens in a bunker belonging to doomsday prepper Howard (John Goodman) who claims he rescued her from an attack that has left the air unbreathable outside. As Michelle talks with the bunker's other occupant, Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), the hired hand who helped Howard build the bunker, Michelle must now determine if the danger outside is real or a paranoid delusion of Howard's.Based on the spec script The Cellar by Josh Campbell and Matt Stuecken that appeared on The Hit List"" of 2012, an annually published list of spec scripts written within the year that have impressed its voting members, the film was purchased by Paramount and originally intended as a low budget feature for their Insurge label. When J. J. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions became involved, rewrites were done by Damien Chazelle who was initially slated to direct as well, but pulled out when his project Whiplash got funding. The movie instead became the feature directing debut of Dan Trachtenberg who came to prominence with his work on the fan film Portal: No Escape. Produced in secrecy under the code name Valencia, as the project developed producers noticed similarities between the film and Cloverfield and gave it branding as a ""blood relative"" of the original film. While the film only has the loosest of connections to Cloverfield, the movie is a solid suspense thriller thanks to its surehanded direction by Trachtenberg and a trio of great performances.At its core 10 Cloverfield Lane is a chamber piece where once we're in the bunker the audience is stuck in the bunker with them. We have no idea what's going on outside and Howard's speculations are the predominant source of information throughout 70% of the film's runtime. Trachtenberg does a good job of establishing the bunker as a character itself with its décor and different rooms carrying distinctive identities and a sense of where and how things work that we come to know the bunker almost as well as the characters do. The tension built from being trapped in the bunker is masterfully done with Trachtenberg mining tension wherever he can and even during moments of relative peace you never feel at ease.Trachtenberg's direction is helped by the fact the three leads are quite strong. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is terrific as Michelle who's established as being someone who runs from conflict early on and is given a strong resonant arc of learning to meet challenges rather than run from them which culminates in a satisfying crescendo in the film's climax. John Gallagher Jr. Is very good playing Emmett and brings some welcome levity to interactions without being grating (such as Hud from the first Cloverfield movie). But the best performance hands down is John Goodman as Howard. Goodman is frightening and intense in the role of this paranoid doomsday prepper as he portrays the character with a hair trigger temper but also a sense of tragedy and sadness that makes him relatable while also making him someone you're always suspicious of. In many ways his performance reminded me of Kathy Bates' performance as Annie Wilkes from Misery where there's a fully developed character there who's even capable of humor, but you know that façade will crack any moment and unleash the beast behind it.10 Cloverfield Lane is a strong genre piece where its isolated setting and limited scope are put to strong effect as a paranoia powered thrill ride. With three engaging leads and tension that doesn't let up until the end credits, it's not only a strong feature directing debut for Dan Trachtenberg, but a strong showcase for its talented cast and as a thriller in its own right. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It WAS so great!,"The first half of this movie is exceptional as it manages to recapture magic from other films like Saw, Hostile, Wild Things, and Old Boy. Being that this film is a Psychological Thriller (for the 1st half anyway) you as the viewer will naturally start trying to figure out what is real, who the main character can trust, and what are all the different possibilities that could true from the very conflicting information exchanged by the characters in the film. Just when you believe you have figured out what is really going on, there is a scene which occurs that will prove you otherwise, which is exactly what you want from A well put together Psychological Thriller. I will briefly go over how the film begins and how it transitions.The opening scene shows our main Character ""Michelle"" (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) an attractive short haired brunette, driving down a stretch of road but quickly becomes involved in a strange accident, with an invisible object it would seem.Michelle wakes up in a dreary, unfamiliar place resembling of a dungeon and holding cell. This has a strong vibe from the movie Saw as she looks down to discover that she is restrained from being able to move far which causes her to have an immediate flight reaction, desperately trying to break her restraint and then discovers her leg is injured from the crash she was in (but seemingly does not recollect)""Howard"" (played by John Goodman) is introduced into the scene as he opens the steal reinforced door to greet Michelle and give her food and water. Michelle desperately tries to figure out Howard's motive but he is very vague with her and says he just wants her to get better. He does try to win her trust by explaining he saved her from a crash and brought her to what is his underground bunker because of an apocalyptic like attack that has occurred. Again, Howard is vague in explaining all of this, which is the norm for him. It is easy to know from Michelle's body language that she does not believe any of this being told to her and she is going to make a run for it when the first chance shows itself.After Michelle's leg felt better she leaves the room that she had awoke in and runs into the last main character ""Emmett"" (played by John Gallagher Jr.) A young country man who is simple minded and a little slow. When Michelle is able to speak with Emmett privately, she begs for his help to escape, but what he tells her baffles her and is the true start of this Psychological thriller which is full of unexpected twists and turns up until the very end.I absolutely loved how this film made me believe that I knew generally where it was going only to completely decimate my theory (3 times) as the movie progressed. The chemistry between Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman is just pure greatness in some of the more suspenseful scenes. The amount of these type of scenes definitely give the movie a serious and uneasy type vibe which manages to stay consistent for the most part, however there was a couple scenes which were very ""off track"" and did not vibe well with the tone and nature of the film. One of the scenes I am referring to just came off as too forced and overexagerated, which caused it to be more like dark comedy instead of suspense, which was unfortunate because this really could have been an epic scene just by toning it down. Not long after this out of place scene came some big reveals. As the movie revealed more and more truths about some of the mysteries my on edge excitement quickly turned into huge disappointment. I honestly don't know if there was ever a movie I had watched before where I transitioned from loving it to hating it so fast! So for me the ending was too over the top and ridiculous, which caused me to lose interest rather fast once I knew for sure what was truly happening. The movie is still very unique however and has some very memorable scenes executed well by the cast so I do recommend it and believe it is worth the watch but just should have, would have, could have been great movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Great until the ending...,"I do like the first Cloverfield film and think it's one of the better found footage films to be made. 10 Cloverfield Lane is also a great film until the ending happens.10 Cloverfield Lane follows Michelle, a woman taken into a shelter by a man named Howard following a car accident. Howard claims the outside world is affected by a large chemical attack but is he telling the truth?If you're expecting 10 Cloverfield Lane to be a sequel to the original Cloverfield film then you will be disappointed. This film acts more like a contained thriller and it really works in that aspect. A large portion of the suspense is created through John Goodman's character. The film does a great job making us constantly wonder whether Howard is telling the truth or not. We never know exactly what is going on in his mind and whether or not he's the good guy. John Goodman does an excellent job conveying this as he appears very suspicious in some scenes whereas in others he seems normal. Goodman ia able to portray both so well and is one of the best parts of the film. Mary Elizabeth Winstead also delivers one of her best performances here. Aside from Scott Pilgrim vs the World, I haven't seen much of her but she really proved herself to be a great performer. John Gallagher Jr. Plays a man stuck in the shelter with Howard and Michelle and he gives a good performance even though I thought his character was pretty underdeveloped.The direction by Dan Trachtenberg is also great. This is his first feature film and he makes use of the enclosed environment really well. There is a great level of claustrophobia throughout and Trachtenberg utilises it well. Where 10 Cloverfield Lane falters is the ending. This film originally had nothing to do with Cloverfield and was a script titled ""The Cellar"". Then J. J. Abrams decided to link it with Cloverfield which seems so unnecessary. This film has nothing to do with Cloverfield until the end. It comes out of nowhere and is such a forceful attempt to link it with the first Cloverfield film. It sticks out so much because of how different it is to the rest of the film and without it, this film would've been much better.Overall, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a good film. It's got great performances and works well as a contained thriller but sadly the ending had to ruin some of the film's quality.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
10 Cloverfield Lane,"10 Cloverfield is a thriller about a woman who wakes up in an underground bunker, after a car crash, and is told by a man that the world is under attack, and she must stay with him. This film is a good thriller, simple as that. Not amazing, outstanding, or brillant, but very good. This film is filled with slights twists and turns in narrative and whom you are supposed to believe, but at the end the audience is hit with a huge twist. Some people may find this twist to ruin the movie, but I think the film's quality was heightened by it. Without the twist, the film would have been left at a more cookie cutter and generic level. Sure its bizzare, but it makes you question what just happend. With only three reoccurring characters in the film, two of them give standout performances. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was solid, and John Goodman was brillant as the prepared, ordered, yet psychotic man. The film sets a tone of isolation, but with a supsenful dark wonder of what the truth really is, and what's out in the world.

Last 35 minutes made it worthwhile,"Cloverfield (2008) is one of the better found footage horrors, and this is a sequel (of sorts) to that as your probably know.This is not filmed in the found footage format and also in the first hour you might think to yourself (is this really a sequel to Cloverfield?) because frankly the similarities up to that point are pretty non-existent.And it's not until a bit later that it starts to resemble a horror even, and plays more as a psychological drama-thriller initially which is a bit peculiar, if this was the first movie or a standalone movie this would have worked great but as a sequel having us wait for that long? I don't know.Well actually I do know now, after doing a little research.The script was never meant as a sequel to Cloverfield, JJ Abrams had read it and liked it a lot so he bought the rights for it and simply decided to have it changed so it would fit into the 'Cloverfield universe'... Which is one way to do it I suppose.Anyways the last 35 minutes are very good and make up for the wait, but as a whole which one should always judge a movie by is far from fantastic...

Suffice it to say the ending was overwrought and unlikely, but then again, the whole film is overwrought and unlikely, but extremely entertaining. I just would have preferred a different ending.

A good watch during spooky season.,"I have been wanting to watch this movie for a long time and it it finally came available on prime, I am a big John Goodman fan and shout out to the Missouri t shirt. It is was a fun thriller. It feels like it was set up for a sequel but at this point, I don't think we're getting one. It's worth the watch though. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what is happening and how is this going to end? If you like a sprinkle of comedy in your horror movies then you will love this movie. Otherwise, it's a perfect addition to your October movie list.The acting was fantastic. The ending was satisfying.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Ramona has flowered,"Not knowing anything about this film - and not having seen the film it is supposed to be related to - I was genuinely happy to see the girl Scott Pilgrim quite rightly battled for, Mary Elizabeth Winstead. John Goodman is also exceptional with the world collapsing in his grizzly fizog.In reality the true relation to this film is the other recent three hander, the much superior Ex Machina. That film kept you wondering till the end, whereas 10 Cloverfield Lane felt like a roll your own adventure, a Frankenstein's monster made of parts you have seen elsewhere. The film satisfies at the time, but holds no memories.Suffice to say it is a thriller that is both fresh and in no part original.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Sometimes Scary, Sometimes Very Slow","I love the original 2008's Cloverfield as it is a strikingly powerful shaky camera horror-packed thriller with astounding tempo and impending doom looming over. This is a kind of sequel albeit a very distant and sometimes not at all, as much of the time this is a dense psychological thriller and not a monster attacj flick. 
What was right, was the casting of menacing John Goodman and awesome Mary Elizabeth Winstead as main parts. They do their job well, keeping this often achingly slow-pacing film somewaht feasible. 
What was wrong, was the pacing, the finalle and the whole lenghth - it could've done a way better were it shorter and faster. Thus, a good isea is somewhat marred and spoilt by a jarring slow tempo and some very wrong plot turns.
I hope the third part of Cloverfield saga would turn up better and ore consistent as this second suffers a lot from what was mentioned above.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"As far as Lanes are concerned, voici a Ten-Blacktop one","The most irresistible moment is when the ""terrible"" Howard (John Goodman) puts the single compact disc of 'Tell Him' (by The Exciters) on the jukebox and rock & roll starts. What I can't understand is the film's classification: not suitable for children under 10 ! In this strange mixture of H. G. Wells and Room, the more the viewer lets himself be manipulated, the better. Either he'll enjoy the surprise game or he'll totally hate the outrageously suffocating, bizarre and perverse mix of claustrophobia plus dystopia. The sense of humor has the same ""subtlety"" as Tarantino, Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam, etc. (It's not even worth mentioning Ivan Cardoso, the man of ""Terrir""). Watch without nitpicking, please.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Very well directed, but cheapened by clear corporate interference !!!","What I liked:1. The Direction - Based on this film, I have to say Dan Trachtenberg has an inherent sense of crafty visual storytelling that really impressed me. I always find a filmmaker's ability to express feelings and emotions and also proceed the narrative with visuals instead of dialogue, extremely remarkable. I found that flavour of Hitchcock- esque 'pure cinema' in '10 Cloverfield Lane'. The opening to this film is wordless and we don't get to hear a single word out of the protagonist Michelle's mouth till about the 9th or 10th minute mark, but the director manages to say a lot during that sequence with just the camera. Trachtenberg's use of camera movement is fluent and expressive(reminded me of the camera movements in 'Don't Breathe'), his ability to generate and raise the tension in specific scenes is uncanny and he also has the ability to get exceptional performances out of the actors.2. The acting - We get marvellous performances from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman. Winstead completely pulls off the task of portraying a character who goes through a spiritual and behavioral transformation over the course of the film and Goodman is exceptional as the wild card who remains a mystery throughout the film.3. The script(for the most part) - The film's core concept, though not new or original, is still refreshing due to Trachtenberg's handling of the material. An undeniable claustrophobia, paranoia and dilemma is always lurking around the corner in every scene in '10 Cloverfield Lane'.What I did not like:THE LAST 15 MINUTES - '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a clear example of a film that can be divided into 2 parts - the part made by a filmmaker which is approximately the first 85 minutes and the part made by a studio committee which is approximately the last 15 minutes. In order to make a direct connection with the original 'Cloverfield' film which was merely tangential up to that point, the film takes a turn for the absurd and does exactly what it managed to avoid till then, which is become bloated and ridiculous in an attempt to emulate big budget, effects heavy, commercial studio films that the world gets inundated with. We get this laughably over the top action sequence which betrays the restraint that ornamented the rest of the film. The final sequence genuinely did put me off to some extent and came close to souring some of the goodwill of the film in my mind. The concept of Michelle outgrowing her fears and making a bold decision could have been executed in a much more subtle fashion which would've been appropriate for the film as a whole.Although the finale is disgustingly plastic and hollow, I can't ignore Dan Trachtenberg's brilliant visual storytelling, tension building and crafty handling of the film and I also can't ignore the remarkable performances on show and it is these elements that make the film worth a recommendation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

""Not many characters"".
""Plot in middle lacked a little adventure"".IntroductionCloverfield is a highly atypical movie series. The first 2008 movie simply called ""Cloverfield"" is nothing like the 2016 sequel we review today. These movies surprise and entertain in a way unlike almost any other sci-fi/Horror movie. Today the 2nd Cloverfield movie ""10 Cloverfield lane"", takes centre stage.StorylineThe storyline is too simple. Yes it details backstories, includes characters well, and surprises with deceit and changing character viewpoints. For me though, it feels slow in the middle and the ending lets it down. The setting is clearly restrictive, which doesn't help it's limited mid-section action.GenreThe surprisingly reliable ""Wikipedia"" defines 10 Cloverfield lane as a ""Psychological horror ... with science fiction elements"". This 2016 release I'd define as simply a Thriller/Sci-fi. Thriller, since it tricks the mind, and Sci-fi because of it's dystopian setting.
Whilst it isn't what you'd expect from a standard horror movie, it has a slightly dark theme. Still not really a horror though ...CharactersThe characters are very well played, and they need to be. The one-dimensional setting throughout, means good acting is essential here. In this way, the film doesn't disappoint. With few characters, the diversity is very effective here and helps with the psychological elements.
The characters and behaviour, with heart-felt emotion, are difficult to fault, and keep surprising you.MusicThe music is used effectively to build tension, yet isn't overused. Types include ""Epic high suspense"" tracks, and ""Calming everyday tracks"". Silence is used on multiple occasion, with good effectiveness. Additional sound effects throughout, may have increased tension at times, but on the whole, music fits the plot well.SummaryKeeps you questioning character values. Setting and storyline, needs a little more development.Find us at reasea dot org",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not what it seems,"To begin with the movie holds you going, with a mystery so conveniently drawn that you have to keep watching. This kind of tensions-driven unclarity is the only interesting part of the first act. The second act tho! is soooo good that it hold the whole movie standing, and without the abusing undertone, this movie would have been a complete flop. Jumping ahead to the final act, which is... well... surprising. I must admit that I'm really not a fan of those type of endings, but it's still an enjoyable refreshment from the claws of cliché-hollywood! 
It may sound like i didn't like this movie, but that's not the case! I just didn't like all of the decisions from the production. The actors are great! especially John Goodman, who is portraying this love-hate character in the perfect resemblance of.... oh! no spoilers ;)",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Superb Cloverfield Spin off,"10 Cloverfield Lane is a tense Horror/Thriller that has you guessing the motives of the characters throughout the film. It's the story of a woman who wakes up in a room underground after a car accident and is told by a farmer that he has saved her from the world outside which he says is uninhabitable . The question is , is he lying and does he have an ulterior motive for keeping her captive? This is a spin off from the 2008 film Cloverfield ( which I loved) but it's hard to say why without giving it away. John Goodman is fantastic as Howard and Mary Elizabeth Winstead is pretty convincing too. Director Dan Trachtenberg did a really good job with this considering it was his debut feature. I really enjoyed this and hopefully we will see more Cloverfield hybrid's in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Thriller turns out to be a Sci-Fi,"If you have watched the trailer or clips it wont be a suspense-surprise package for you .Film is made with lowest budget possible and gives audiences thrills & chills in the second half of the movie. Its a Thriller is the first half & turns out to be a sci-fi flick in the second. John Goodman (Howard) dominates the play with his mature acting abilities .Other 2 characters played by Mary elizabeth (Michelle) & John Gallagher(emmette) not looked so dedicated towards the act.Not so awesome script but scenes keeps audiences on their toes.Turning points in the movie keep giving sudden shocks & kicks.Film ends with a good climax and indicating a sequel to this well directed film. After coming out of the screens you are forced to think again and again what actually Howard was trying to achieve.Its a good film though ,will give 2 n half stars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
