"Low Budget, Does not have to equal Low Quality","It probably cost about half the budget of this movie, to make the opening sequence, which successfully gets your attention. Once it has your attention it simply refuses to let you go, it is compelling to say the least.The entire cast were pretty much unknown when the film was made (and most still are), but they all gave fine performances throughout. Without the successful casting this film could have easily been a disaster, as it is almost entirely character driven. I'm glad to say that definitely is not the case.Despite the low budget and practically unknown cast, the film manages to be clever, intriguing, thought-provoking and highly enjoyable. sadly, this film is probably a one off, i can't think of another low budget film that has half the impact of this one.8/10 and worth every point",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"You ever get stuck in an elevator? Multiply that emotion by 1,000","Great. Another shining example of how my inadequacy in mathematics could be the end of me. I used to skip math class. I took the bare minimum requirement expected of me and passed with something less than flying colours. The point is, math is all that separates our ""heroes"" from certain death in this arena.""Cube"" is an innovative little thriller that can safely dodge accusations of blandness or mediocrity. The premise is simple and the plight of the characters is highly relative despite its surrealistic science fiction setting. Six individuals find themselves trapped in a cube comprised of many rooms linked together, with no readily visible way out, no rations, tools or explanation for being there, with traps set up in some of the rooms. An apparent experiment on how people think and react to certain situations and the transformations they might undergo.The simplicity of the film and the cube itself are the film's strongest assets and can probably account for it's international success, notably in Japan. It's low budget production costs came under $400,000. But they got a really good bang for their buck with some help from special effects houses that provided their services free of charge. As the director has commented on the audio commentary track of the DVD, one aspect they were going for was a way to have an action flick in one room. They pulled it off quite nicely. Another interesting tidbit brought to light was that each character's name is after a prison.A curious aspect of this Canadian film was its surprisingly short run in Canadian cinemas. In speaking with one of the film's producers, Mehra Meh, I learned that despite it's award as ""Best First Feature"" at the Toronto Film Festival of 1997, the film run in Canada came a year later and was just for a few short weeks before it was yanked from theaters and then showcased internationally. When time came for the DVD release, I found another perplexing development. It was only available as an import. A Canadian film only available as an import in Canada? It wasn't until months later that it was released domestically.In any case, the film is available now and worth checking out if you have interest in the psychological thriller fare. Those who work their days or nights (or both) in a cubicle may wish to pass on this one, as it just might be too close to home.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This is one freaky movie...,"Cube is a movie that explores human nature and our instinctive urges for survival vs our humanitarianism. Not a new concept, I know, however this movie does it in style, with a plot so simple that it could only be the work of a conceptual genius. I don't intend to give too much away, as the power of the film lies in it's mystery, but I will say that this movie could almost be classified as disturbing, not due to its content, but rather the thoughts that it instills in the audience. I found myself rather shaken as I left the cinema, feeling as though I had been exposed to an ugly, hidden side of humanity and society. Don't get me wrong, this movie is definitely worth seeing, I would even be so bold as to say that it must be seen! I must admit that there are few movies I have seen that have had such a profound affect on me, and I don't think I am alone in my feelings.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Unique but ultimately unsatisfying.,"""Cube"" is certainly a unique movie. The brilliant, absolutely irresistible premise grabs you instantly, and the production design keeps you impressed. The first hour of this picture was thoroughly engrossing and full of surprises; I would even call it ""astonishing"" if the actors didn't deliver some obviously forced, unnaturally ""profound"" speeches, and if the director didn't try to create dramatic moments by taking the easy way out - having the characters argue with each other all the time; if they acted as a team and tried to overlook their differences, THAT would have been the REALLY original approach. Still, the movie was fast-paced and fully engrossing.And then, about 20 minutes before the end, it begins to collapse! The mathematical calculations become IMPOSSIBLE to decipher and follow. A major character changes his behavior completely. And the ending is a real disappointment. Some people have said it's ""surprising""; I think it's a total cop-out. It doesn't provide any explanations, and it doesn't provide any clues for us to try to figure it out on our own. I watched the last five minutes three times. They leave you with an intense ""THAT'S IT?"" feeling.Overall, this movie is definitely worth seeing, and the acting isn't nearly as bad as most people say, but be prepared for a HIGHLY unsatisfying ending. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the most original sci-fi films of the last decade,"If you were to think about what situation would terrify you the most, Cube would be the ultimate challenge.  In a way, it is a predecessor to TV's ""Survivor"" in which the people each have a skill that can help them survive and possibly get them out.  It all comes down to human emotions and confrontations that get in the way of progress.  It's a talky film, but that's the point-- figuring situations and dealing with different personalities is inevitable to any group.  The solving of problems becomes very complex, but the viewer doesn't have to worry...let the characters figure it out as we go along for the ride.  While so many sci-fi films want to wow you with effects, this film does something more challenging--it makes you think.  With its limited budget and digital effects in use even before Titanic glorified them, Cube still proves itself as one of the more original and intelligent sci-fi films of the last decade, with a cult status already going strong. It is truly a nail-biter.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Cult Classic Sci-Fi!!,"SPOILER: Vincenzo Natali. Funny sounding name right? Well just a little funny. Keep that name in your mind though over the next few years. After this film the Cube, Natali's follow up was the superb Cypher. He seems to be a master of a difficult genre, Sci-Fi. In a genre that is primarily known for having a high pap ratio, the fact that Natali's first two features have been cult classic science fiction movies then bodes well for Sci-fi fanatics who will eagerly anticipate his next movie. The Cube is a superbly crafted low budget film. On a shoestring budget and a dangerously basic premise full of intrigue, the film succeeds because of imaginative effects and taut directions as well as a superbly written script, delving into the human psyche in such an extreme situation. The plot is basically thus: A group of strangers wake in a cube room. They don't know where they are or how they got there but they know they must find a way out. It also transpires that when they leave each room the enter another room that is virtually identical in look. There will perhaps be a different colour in the lighting. The must find their way out before they starve tp death or go nuts, but to add to their woes, it seems that some of the rooms are booby trapped, ranging from sound activated, to pressure activated traps. They soon discover that each of them has a specific gift that can perhaps hold the key to their escape. There is a maths genius who may hold the key to discovering a way out. The rooms are numbered and the numbers could signify the type of room but also a map. The film is excellent and just when they think they have figured it out the Cube bites them in the behind. The dynamic of the characters is excellent as inevitably some go crazy. I do think that for a film shot for less than 300,000 dollars this is amazing looking. It works well for a film that is set in the same environment for the 90 minutes of the film. I have to say this film is one of those pleasant surprises that comes from nowhere and when word of mouth finally gets to you, please listen! ****",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Other than the girl who plays the student, I've never seen any of the actors before, which makes the movie much harder to predict than most.The air of mystery prevails throughout.

Scifi concept alone is worth a watch,"The Cube is one of those 'just on the verge of becoming a cult movie' titles that unfortunately doesn't quite stick the landing, but it'll leave you thinking of just ""what even is the point.."" to many things afterwards.Is it social commentary? Philosophical? Perhaps. But not obvious when watching it as it tries to entertain you.Content warning for body horror, although as a teen watching this on VHS, the effects are pretty awesome and not something you forget easily, heck, the Resident Evil movie that came not soon after this one even lifted one of the horrible ways someone can die - and hint hint, the title gives it away.8 is perhaps a high score, because while it is memorable and definitely worth watching for any true scifi fan, it is pretty hammy in most other aspects.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Intriguing concept ruined by terrible script,"Interesting, suspenseful flick, with some great direction, hampered by terrible acting and atrocious dialogue. The overall concept is an intriguing one, and could have made for a better film in the hands of a competent writer, but instead the screenplay is filled with idiotic characters and ludicrous dialogue. Combined with some terrible overacting by most of the cast, and the dialogue-heavy scenes become painful to watch. Fortunately, the 'action' sequences redeem the film, as they are shot well and become incredibly suspenseful - especially the scene with the quiet room. Some great gore effects and a fitting ambiguous ending make it a worthwhile viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Mindbendingly excellent flick...,"This is art. Plain and simple, art. This film reminds me of Memento, a very low-budge film that is better than 95% of the high-budge films out there. Why? Because it relies on the story and the quality of acting to make it great, not C.G.I. and overpaid mainstream actors. Not only is it a well presented thriller, it's also a study of the breakdown of human emotions and sanity when kept in solitude outside of one's comfort zone. The cube tests the characters' ability to function and work together in alien territory while in constant imminent danger. This is just a brilliant film made by a brilliant writer/director. This movie is a must for any lover of psychological thrillers. - Rob",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A pretty decent watch, original too.","The whole idea of the Cube is such a great one, I love the concept of the room, the fact that it's a puzzle. Film making so much more creative back in the nineties, a time where films weren't just recycled stories.The characters aren't exactly what you'd call loveable, in all honesty apart from two you keep on hoping they'll just walk into a booby trapped cube.The main body of the story is good, it also has some nice tension, and some random events to keep you guessing, like new characters randomly dropping in.The ending sucked, all those crazed events, all those calculations, only to be let down by such a dreadful conclusion.It does perhaps feel a little dated, some of the effects are poor by today's standards, but considering it's from 1997, I'd recommend. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Cube - An Intelligent and Intriguing Sci-Fi/Horror,"Five people (later six) wake up inside a giant cube with thousands of rooms inside which are cubes themselves. Some of these rooms are trapped, some are not. These people have no idea how they got there and none of them know each other but they all have a purpose and they must use these purposes to try and escape the giant maze before they die of dehydration.....or madness.This low-budget independent Canadian film is brilliant and a very captivating watch. It's a fairly simple concept but at the same time it is very complex and deep. All the characters are there for a reason and the reasons are fleshed out and believable. The idea of how the cube works is also fleshed out and you can tell the filmmakers really spent a lot of time exploring it. It all seems believable which is important for a movie like this.But the thing I really admire about the film is that the ending doesn't try to explain anything. It leaves everything up to you, you have to figure things out for yourself. The ending leaves a sense of dread and paranoia and is very effective. The traps are also very cool and some of the resulting gore is pretty nasty.4½/5",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
simple Kafkaesque concept,Alderson (Julian Richings) wakes up inside a cubic room with exits on all sides. He climbs into the next room and is killed by a trap. Policeman Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint) climbs into a new cube and finds injured secretive Worth (David Hewlett) passed out. Then others join them. Holloway (Nicky Guadagni) is a doctor. Leaven (Nicole de Boer) is a fearful math whiz. Wrennes (Wayne Robson) is an ingenious escape artist. Nobody remembers how they got there. Leaven notices unique numbers in each cube. Wrennes gets killed. Then Leaven realizes only rooms with prime numbers are traps. They run into mentally challenged Kazan (Andrew Miller).It's such a great and simple Kafkaesque idea. There are minimal sets. The flashiness comes from the interactions. It's a good indie thriller. It's a bit pointless like the cube itself. There are some slow spots in the middle. I also wish the ending is more compelling. The numbers get more complicated and it gets harder to follow. It's still a nice little indie thriller.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good horror doesn't need a big budget,"From what I can tell of the other online reviews for 'Cube,' it's one of those films that you'll either love or hate. Personally, I absolutely loved it from the first time I saw it and have subsequently seen it many times since. I guess I can understand people not really getting behind it. It's hardly a rollercoaster or a thrill ride with hordes of brilliantly computer-generated monsters ripping people apart. Although it is pretty horrific - you just have to think it through.Six strangers wake up inside, what is technically, one giant Rubik's Cube. However, this one doesn't just take half your life getting one piece of blue square out of an entire side of red - this one has lethal traps inside which can do anything from melt your face, to completely dicing you all together. How did they get there? They don't know. All they know is that there's no food or water on hand, therefore they better figure out how to get out of there before they starve to death (and so rob the traps of the honour of killing them).And that's about it. It's a simple (and highly condensed/claustrophobic) little tale with no real major set-pieces (the cube is technically the same one room, endlessly repeated - only in different colours), no recognisable stars, few special effects and - possibly most importantly - few (if any!) answers to the questions raised.Like I say, I personally love it. I find it as tense now as I did when I first watched it (even though I know what happens to everyone!). Yes, I know the lack of 'star-power' does actually mean that some of the actors deliver their lines a bit poorly, but I forgive it on account of the fact that it clearly doesn't have that much of a budget and yet it still was able to pull together something that is truly memorable.If you want something big budget and exciting, this is definitely not for you. However, if you're looking for something small, tense, creepy and downright scary if you think about putting yourself in any of the protagonists' situation and work out how you might survive in such a foreign situation, then definitely give this one a go. It's not a 'cult classic' for nothing.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Horror Wrapped Up in Mystery,"This film begins with a man waking up and finding himself in a symmetrical room with an exit hatch on all four walls along with one on the floor and one on the ceiling. After choosing to go through one of the exists leading into a similar room, he accidentally triggers an unseen mechanism which activates razor sharp wires that cut him into pieces. Then scene then shifts to another person waking up in another room and eventually being joined by several other strangers who have found themselves in the same situation. Although none of them have any idea what they are doing in this place, one thing they do know is that some of the rooms they almost went through while seeking a way out were booby trapped. Fortunately, as luck would have it, they are then joined by a well-known escape artist named ""Rennes"" (Wayne Robson) who informs them that he intends to find his way to freedom and that, if they want out, all they need to do is to follow him. However, their hopes are soon dashed when he is killed in one of the rooms--and they suddenly realize that they are going to have to work together if they are ever going to live to see another day. The problem is that one of them has an extremely violent temper, which begins to manifest itself whenever he becomes angry or frustrated--and it isn't long until they realize that he might be just as dangerous as some of these rooms. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was a rather bizarre horror film which seemed to get better the longer it went on. I especially liked the performance of Maurice Dean Wint (as ""Quentin McNeil"") who played his part quite well. In any case, while this movie might not be to everyone's liking, I enjoyed it and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"The good, the mediocre, and the very bad","""Cube"" has gained a sizable cult reputation, and I was pretty curious when I finally got to see it now, in 2008. Although I expected a certain amount of rough edges from its indie/low-budget background, I have to say the edges were rougher than I expected. There is a giant chasm between what is good about this movie, and what is bad about it. Personally I can handle movies that are ""wrong"" in some ways, if they have other things going for it. ""Lawnmower Man"" is an example of a movie where viewer forgiveness may go to such extents that the movie becomes enjoyable. ""Cube"", unfortunately, didn't pass this threshold with me.To summarize my thoughts, top-down:1. the basic premise of the movie is excellent, as is the set design2. on a synopsis level, it's still pretty good, though some aspects (like the ""Rain Man"" type character) look contrived3. on a script/chain of events level, it's decent, and explores the basic premise well. The complete lack of character exposition is problematic though.4. on a script/DIALOGUE level, I think it's pretty damn weak, and the acting makes this problem worse.I don't think I've seen a promising movie with such awful dialogue in a long time. The characters, trapped in a hostile environment, start hating each other after about 2 minutes. Idiotic, and bizarrely lacking in psychological realism. And those lofty philosophical exchanges about society, responsibility, existence and so on -- which the characters launch into as if someone had suddenly pressed a button on their backs? If you want to insist on metaphors, why not use your brains and be elegant and original about it?The actors didn't help much. The ""cop"" guy lost all credibility after an OK start, but the female doctor was beyond belief from the first minute. I'm not sure the actors are to blame, as much as the director... but they sure didn't help.I wasn't very impressed with ""Saw"" (the first one), but ""Cube"" made that one look like ""The Shining"". This movie should be re-made with a completely rewritten dialogue, strong actors, and a much improved opening and ending. Too bad.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I enjoy the character interactions, though they themselves are a bit weak and die off pretty quickly enough.The characters sometimes give their own opinion on why or what the Cube is, and I love that. This is a common element that is forgotten in many of the stories that have come since the Cube.However in this story, they never explain anything; it just ends with one of the players escaping.

"To paraphrase Saucy Jack - ""Years from now people will look back and say that Cube gave birth to 21st century Psychological Horror"". It sure did.","I've always been a devout fan of story-centered Horror films with smart and surprising plot twists and endings. To me, these films (for instance many titles by James Wan) embody the perfect combination of Horror and Psychological Thriller (most titles of the Saw anthology come to mind as a shining example). As a fan of such, I must pay proper respects to Cube, which just might be the title that had originally presented this particular sub-genre years before the first Saw reinvented it (even though it sadly fails to deliver an actual plot twist).As the plot summary and trailers have most likely told you already - Cube begins, continues and ends with the struggle of six strangers who awake to a living nightmare in which they're trapped inside a giant maze rigged with traps. The way I see it, Cube relies on three main features. First, the film's main feature is deception, as everything we're made to think we know about each character on one hand and their devastatingly discomforting predicament on the other first comes into question and later, at times, shatters completely. This serves as a metonymic representation of the fact that nothing around is familiar, known of comprehendible, both in the maze and in the characters' lives as part of human society.The second feature is discomfort, which has become a key characteristic of many modern Horror films that have crossed the classical boundaries of a haunting ghost or a hunting killer. From the start, the main antagonist is the setting (i.e. the maze), into which the characters have been forced and out of which they barely have a prayer of escaping. As stress, fatigue and of course hunger and dehydration are gradually added to the equation - the characters become paranoid and distrustful, sometimes for good reasons. The genius single location and lack of any flashbacks and past/future scenes only serve to enhance the sensation of discomfort: there's nowhere and no time to which the characters can escape, the nightmare is real and is the only thing that exists for them.The third and less profound feature is the philosophical dimension added by the characters' different perceptions and attitudes regarding life's rules of conduct and terms of endeavor, so to say. As they discuss and relate their own individual explanation to their situation - questions of life, humanity and personality arise, making the viewer constantly think and ponder while following the characters' attempts at survival and escape. While this might have been considered a relief from the aforementioned sense of discomfort (since focusing on anything but the reality of the nightmarish predicament might give a false sense of hope) - it turns out it actually feeds the fear and despair, as each explanation is both realistic and authentic (to the extent you'd attribute logic and rationale to conspiracy theories and sci-fi scenarios) and more terrible than the other.The acting is professional and excellent, the story is original and innovative and the plot is compelling and suspenseful, always keeping the viewer on edge. Even the minimalistic soundtrack is great, although too much resembling a Slasher theme in my opinion. The only let down for me had been, as I mentioned in the beginning, the blunt lack of an actual plot twist, or an actual ending. While the open ending could be considered another element of discomfort and lack of clarity - I firmly believe a smart plot twist would have made this film perfect.And yet, made over two decades ago - Cube still sets a standard few Horror and Psychological Thriller titles manage to meet today. It isn't frightening of that scary (as it doesn't really rely on fear), but a true psychological Horror combining discomfort, torture, despair and pursuit which manage to exquisitely deliver every stressful and agonizing sensation to the viewing audience. While this is solely my personal opinion - I can't recommend this film enough, even to those who aren't particularly fond of Horror films.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Ahead of its Time!,"Seven complete strangers of widely varying personality characteristics are involuntarily placed in an endless Kafkaesque maze containing deadly traps.This film was a hit when it first came out. I do not recall if I saw it then or not. It seems familiar, but not enough to be certain. Regardless, it was clearly influential. Such films as ""Saw II"" used very much the same premise, though with a much smaller science fiction aspect. Was this conscious? Maybe, maybe not. But it was no doubt an influence.The weakest thing about this is how one-dimensional the characters are.

Living In A Box.,"Okay, I agree with the majority of people around here in thinking that ""Cube"" is a fairly intelligent and well-constructed Sci-Fi thriller, but did it REALLY deserve all the hype and exceptionally high ratings it received? Basically, it's only the conceptual design and claustrophobic atmosphere that are unique here, while the evolution of the characters and their behavior certainly isn't new. ""Cube"" is not the first film that gathers different and seemly-unrelated characters in an unusual setting where it quickly becomes clear that not the location but their own personal difficulties and the urge for survival form the biggest danger. That's just stating the obvious. Force people to cooperate and depend on each other and bad things WILL happen, especially if the situation is life threatening. The whole success of reality-TV shows like ""Big Brother"" is based on this concept! So by now you already know that the story of ""Cube"" revolves on a group of people that wake up and find themselves trapped in a peculiar location. Six people, to be exact, with different backgrounds and occupations (a math student, a cop, a shrink, an architect, an autistic boy and a criminal) have to find their way out of a mathematical construction stuffed with codes and booby traps. Naturally, they're disorientated Unaware of what they possibly could have done to deserve this test or who's the evil mastermind behind this. ""Cube"" is a powerful motion picture with a truckload of tension, eeriness and ingenious camera-tricks. The budget obviously was very limited, but talented director like Vincenzo Natali largely compensates this by using simple eye-candy (the disturbing color shades!) and implementing psychological terror. Personally, I didn't understand one iota of all the mathematical mumbo-jumbo, but it was fascinating to listen to and it certainly kept me on the edge of my seat. Often read criticism goes out to the acting performances, but I thought they were very adequate, especially considering the faces were unfamiliar.

Cube never goes for cheap thrills and instead, makes its characters work proactively, challenging their deepest intellect to earn their right to survive; a rare feat that most horror screenwriters would too lazy to bother with.

Whilst it's still got some moments, time hasn't been too kind to the microbudgeted Canadian thriller.A group of unconnected individuals wake up in a series of cubed shaped rooms, each of which has a hatch at the centre of all six sides. As they traverse the rooms and find each other, they discover that some of the rooms contain lethal traps. The group must learn to work together, using their specific skills to try and make it to the edge of the construction, but personality clashes, and the pressure of life and death choices start to take their toll.It's a great conceit for a movie, you have to give the film that. A single set, that is just redressed for a different moments - an easy to understand concept, but with science fiction trappings and horror overtones, but ultimately it's about people under pressure and how they react. When I used to watch it before, I think I took it at face value - but these many years later, the section of the film that resonates with me the most is the talk about silo systems and how wasteful and ridiculous things can be in business, obviously we're talking more about say, reports generated for years that nobody cares about, rather than accidentally creating and populating an underground death experiment.One or two other reviewers have said that the performances aren't great, personally I'd lay that criticism a little more at the feet of the script, rather than the actors - most of whom still work in the industry today. The visual effects are a mixed bag, some of the practical stuff is really great, including that memorable opening scene death, but later CGI work is less successful and is one true place where the film budget betrays it.Whilst it still has some power, particularly in its opening scenes, the longer it goes - the more repetitive it gets and the less the logic holds up.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Sartre meets ""Prison"" !?","Right now, ""Cube"" is being released in France with an unbelievable success for a movie with no ""name actors"" and no hype, expect the numerous prices it got at the (formerly deconsidered by critics and audiences alike) Gerardmer film festival. It probably proves that the audiences are expecting something else than stupid Hollywood blockbusters fare. This one is very much a play on Sarte's ""Huis clos"" (""L'enfer, c'est les autres"" - ""Hell is the other people"") infused with thriller and sometimes basic horror overtones. The scenario seems to have been written by a philosopher and a mathematician, and the ending seems to enter religious parable territory (""Happy are the feeble-minded""). I thought the pretty thin premise would wear thin after an exciting first half-hour, but the movie never lets go, helped by a very strong cast. Sometimes, there are artificial or too obvious ways to highten the tension (Like killing first the prisoner who seems the most likely to survive and a sudden incursion in Friday the 13th territory, etc) but this is understandable for a first effort and gives some naive, passionate flavor to the proceedings, compared to computer-generated Hollywoodian scenarios. Besides, this proves you don't have to make a billion-sized blockbuster choke-full of special effects to build up a good movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Mind-Bending Classic,"I recently watched ""Cube"" (1997), and I was thoroughly impressed. This film is a masterclass in psychological horror and suspense. The minimalist setting and the complex, interwoven plot keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The way it explores human nature under extreme stress is both fascinating and disturbing. The characters are well-developed, each bringing their own unique perspective and backstory that adds depth to the narrative. The performances are compelling, and the atmosphere is palpably tense. The film's use of practical effects and clever set design to create the titular cube is both innovative and effective. It's incredible how much tension and intrigue are generated with such a simple premise. For anyone who loves a good psychological thriller with a twist, ""Cube"" is a must-watch. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, provoking thought and discussion. Highly recommended!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
amazing..,"I have watched Cube many times, and every time it was amazing.  The acting in this movie is what amazed me most, next to the plot.  The characters are perfect for the roles they were assigned to.  I don't think there is anybody else who could have played them better.  If you watch it for the first time, you should watch it alone, in a dark room, without being interrupted. That is how the movie will have the best effect on you.  This movie really makes you think for a long time afterwards.  The ending of this movie would not have been better any other way.  It tells you just enough to feel like a right ending, and still wonder for hours about what, who, why.  This is definitevely one of those films you should see at least once in your lifetime. Just watch this movie! You will not be dissapointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Tension squared.,"Ignoring the highly unlikely probability of six people placed in separate cubes somehow safely converging, despite there being countless possible routes for them to take (with many booby trapped rooms along the way), the script for Cube is taut, smartly-written and engaging, primarily a well-observed study of human nature, but also an original little sci-fi thriller, the premise of which predates the similarly themed Saw movies by quite a few years.Not knowing how they got there, the film's six disparate characters (a schoolgirl, a doctor, a criminal, a mentally disabled man, a cop and an architect) try to find a way out of their unusual predicament, but as time goes by, nerves begin to fray and tempers flare, resulting in a fight for survival. Decent performances from the minimal cast help the film to hold one's attention, even when the focus shifts from creative death scenes (cheese wire and acid traps result in some neat gore) to more psychological horror.I can understand how the ambiguous ending of the film might be deemed a disappointment by some, but I like how the nature and purpose of the cube remains a mystery.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A good idea, but...","This is a weird one, but worth the $2 to see it.  You have an interesting idea of placing different individuals from all walks of like together in what turns out to be a type of Human-Rat Maze.What keeps this movie from being a 9 or a 10 is that the movie never really opens up on the fact of why the people that are in the movie were chosen, and how they got there.This movie will keep your interest until about 3/4 of the way through, when it starts to drag and the plot corrodes away to your basic ""bad guy"".If you like Sci-fi, film-noire types, give this one a look, its surely worth spending a couple bucks.6.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Clever and Inventive.,"I was just introduced to ""The Cube"", a low budget sci-fi film that had so much more to say than the standard sci-fi films that are put out recently. It's actually a relief to find a story with something to say other than total reliance on pretty CG eye candy.""The Cube"" tells the story of a group of what essentially are prisoners trapped in an hi-tech deathtrap for no apparent reason, by no explainable jailer. And in that same explanation, the purpose behind the cube becomes apparent: It does serve a purpose, whether it is merely to entertain the psychopathic whims of a person/corporation with too much time and money or their hands, or an experiment designed to foster the breakdown of basic decency in humankind, and bring out the worst in people. Despite all the numerous and gruesome traps in each smaller cube, they prove to be the least of the threats within.The story can be taken with a lot of meanings. Some literal, some double, and some are never explained at all. Some story aspects, like the Cube itself, just ARE. And instead of feeling like the story was underdeveloped, or shortchanged by the need of more explanation, you're left with a sense of curiosity as to what really happened to bring all of these characters and factors together. Just when the viewer thinks it understands something, the story, like the cube itself, changes and becomes deeper.All in all, ""The Cube"" was a fascinating film. I understand that it's followed by two sequels, and I'll be approaching them wondering if they'll add on or take away from the simplistic intrigue of this movie. But as a stand alone film, ""The Cube"" will definitely have you talking. And thinking.And it's good to see a film like that again.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Cult classic,"After watching this movie, I immediately had to show the opening scene to other friends, for it jump starts right into the land of Cube. This movie has long been on my list of random movies that I needed to watch and it did not disappoint. The ending is unbelievable and the acting is subpar, and in the year 2019 the 1990s special effects can be distractingly fake but still impressive. Overall though, it's entertaining to watch the characters pick apart the mystery of the prison that they find themselves. This is a study into the ultimate will to survive and whether or not teamwork is an essential element of it. The audience never really gets all the answers, but this puts us in the same position of insecurity and helplessness that the characters find themselves in.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

But there's no logic here...??,"Six strangers find themselves in a mysterious cube, with no knowledge of how they got there. And if you're hoping for an explanation, dream on because there is none.So, we have a cop, escape artist, doctor, office clerk, a girl with a mathematical brain, and a mentally challenged genius who doesn't really speak. Together they have to find a way out. For the next 90 minutes we watch them going from cube, to cube, to cube, to cube. Some cubes are booby trapped, some are not, and they have to figure out which are in order to try and make it out of the cube.Was it an interesting watch? Yeah, I guess so. But the more sense they tried to make of the cube, the less sense it made. Critics and audiences alike praised the movie. But why? There is no logic here. Yes, as interesting as it was watching them trying to solve the mystery, I still want to know who built this giant cube, and why? And why were these six people put in the cube, and by whom? Where the hell is this enormous cube anyway? Containing 17,576 rooms - some with motion and sound activated traps - this must have cost an absolute fortune to construct, not to mention the implications, since the rooms are shifting as well.

Effective thriller that sticks close to the clever premise to keep it simple and very enjoyable,"Quentin wakes up in a square room with exits on each wall. Soon he is joined by other people, strangers, who also have no idea where they are. Looking around they find that each room leads to another one that looks just the same. One of the group is the famous prison escape artist Rennes, who realises that some of the rooms are booby-trapped but that he thinks he has got the solution. With no other ideas the group follow him and try to evade the traps and stay alive  all the time with absolutely no idea of why they are here or who has imprisoned them.I heard about this film years ago but only recently managed to find it on television to watch. It is hard to think that it is almost a decade old now but that it is still effective and a regular cult movie that people will still talk about. Its power is in its simplicity  every room is the same and every next room could be safe or could be a trap; there is no reason for any of it and there appears to be no way out. Usually this sort of stuff makes for a great pitch but not always a good movie because the idea can't stretch beyond a catchy gimmick, however here it does it and makes it look easy. The whole film is our characters trying to work their way through the rooms without getting horribly killed. This in itself is gripping and at times unbearable to watch  horror fans may be disappointed that long periods go by without a lot of gore but personally I prefer tension to the delivery.At the same time we also get the characters feeding the mystery of the cube, building the tension and the sense of hopelessness without ever really solving anything. It answers questions with more questions and keeps things moving well. The development of the characters is better than I expected and I liked the way that the film played with the characters, changing them as the film went along. It isn't a fantastic character piece but again it is just something that helps keep the film moving and I suppose it was interesting to see the nature of people come out. In that regard I was also impressed by the cast. I had expected poor performances from a low budget film but actually they were all quite good. Wint is best but towards the end his performance became a bit too simplistic. Hewlett underplays and probably has the least character to deal with but is still good. De Boer was effective and interesting. Robson was a nice distraction. Guadagni was a good counterweight for Wint and played well to develop him and herself at the same time. Miller was good and the pace of the film helped distract from him basically doing a Rain Man impression.Overall an impressive low budget thriller that works because it sticks to the simple idea while building side issues with the characters and the cube around it but never actually solving anything. Perhaps it is better not to over praise it because I thought it was at its best because I didn't know what was going to happen.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Modern Sci Fi finally gets my attention!,"This is one of those films I have heard alot about but because of it's genre, I always found something else to watch instead.  For the most part modern Sci-Fi has fallen flat.  By modern, I mean post Aliens, Enemy Mine, and John Carpenter's: The Thing.  However I finally caught this one on a late Friday Night playing on IFC.  I was astonished.  The tense nature of this film is quite unparalleled to films of recent memory.  The nemesis is unknown and the purpose of it is unknown.  This may turn off a few viewers but this film basically says, ok they don't know what the Cube is, they don't know why it is, and neither should you.  It is strange how Hollywood feels we need to know Who?, What?, Where?, and Why?, in every film.What is the point? There are alot of everyday situations that go on in normal life that do not answer that question.  That is why I applaud this metaphorical middle finger at Hollywood filming.  This film is a hidden gem and worth picking up.  I wish I had been in on the gag when it first appeared, but with films like this I do not mind being a late bloomer.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Well directed,"For a low budget film that didn't make any money at the box office this sure found a life after it's theatrical release even, unfortunately, spawning some sequels. I hadn't seen this in many years and expected to rave about it, but this has some serious writing issues. It's still a unique concept and it's still a bit of a thrill ride to watch, but I remember being in awe the first time I saw it. Perhaps that awe blinded me to the idiotic way these people behave. At a time when they couldn't need each other more they behave like antagonistic animals. OK, it's science fiction and you have to take a number of things with a grain of salt sometimes, but I sure wish their behavior had been more logical than full of drama just for drama's sake. Considering its budget limitations, it's very well constructed and at no point does it seem cheaply made and the sets work beautifully, though according to what I read here there really is only one set. Some of the actors are way over the top especially Nicky Guadagni as Holloway, the doctor, though in her defense her dialog is outrageously ridiculous and Maurice Dean Wint as Quentin, the cop. I can nitpick all day, but it still is a fun trip if you've never seen it before.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Simple and effective.,"You can't beat a good opening scene and this has one of the best in the sci-fi horror genre. It doesn't mess around from that initial sharpener either. At an economical 90 minutes, there's little time for pleasantries. We're trapped in a cube. A cube of cubes. All interlocking, with 6 doors each and many booby trapped. The ensemble cast don't know why they're there or how. There's 6 of them... after number 7 gets diced before the opening credits. They're left to navigate an escape through this psychological Crystal Maze. We've got a doctor, a cop, a criminal, a math nerd... an architect. It's a bit tropey, a bit cheesy, especially Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint) the cop, who plays his role wonderfully over the top and Holloway (Nicky Guadagni) the doc, whose paranoia, although functional is a bit annoying. It's a genius idea though. Essentially the same set, same room, same cube, lit differently. The repetition adds to the building tension, as the team start to lose their collective marbles. Tracking numbers, deciphering one another, what does it all mean? Why are they there? and what connects them? They're not an altogether likeable bunch, that is until Kazan (Andrew Miller) drops in. He falls through the ceiling door of one room and into the lives of our wannabe escape artists. There's some lovely set pieces too, the room trapped with sound sensors and the realisation that the rooms are moving. It does have a very solid 90s aesthetic, largely down to its soundtrack, but you can't hold that against it, it's great piece of cinema. A bit cult, possibly classic. Director Vincenzo Natali I don't think has topped this on the big screen, but has had a hand in some pretty great TV. He certainly has a gift for working a good idea on a budget. Apparently he was down to direct the Tremors reboot, which would've been worth a watch had it not been canned.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It was intriguing, and I can't tell if it's original or not, but I do know that a lot of elements were copied after in such movies as Resident Evil, Saw, Alice in Borderlands...maybe Cube comes from something else too...

Claustrophobic cult film from Canada,"Cube is a mysterious science-fiction horror movie made with a meager budget of three hundred fifty thousand dollars that would turn out grossing nine million dollars and lead to two less interesting sequels. The claustrophobic movie revolves around six completely different strangers who wake up in a gigantic cube without knowing how or why they got there. Since they have no access to food or water or any way to communicate with the outside world, they need to find their way through the numerous chambers of the gigantic cube in order to find a way out. The different chambers are however rigged with deadly traps and tension, stress and fear soon arise between the six strangers.There are numerous elements that made this low-budget movie a beloved cult film. First of all, the mysterious setting and its origins are truly intriguing. It's unclear who created the gigantic cube and to what purpose which invites viewers to look for clues and come to their own conclusions. Secondly, the story is filled with twists and turns and it remains unpredictable who is going to survive and how until the very last Scene that also leaves room for interpretation. Thirdly, the traps in the cube are deadly, diversified and unpredictable but the greatest dangers are the individuals themselves. This leads to the fourth and strongest element which are the seven characters introduced in the movie. We only briefly meet a nameless old man but the clever prison escapist, the paranoid free clinic doctor, the mathematics student with a difficult past, the socially awkward office worker, the seemingly autistic young man who has trouble communicating but incredible mathematical skills and the divorced police officer with anger management issues are the six characters bound by fate. The relationships between the different characters are fascinating to watch and evolve until the very end.In the end, Cube works very well despite a low budget thanks to a creative story with numerous stunning ideas and intriguing characters. The sequels don't reproduce this level of quality because the stories are more predictable and the characters more exchangeable. Even though this movie mixes thriller, mystery and horror elements, it can also been as a stunningly realistic social science study.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Cube v. Hypercube,"I've watched Cube and Hypercube both in the past two days and come out with the conclusion that Hypercube is by far the superior movie, and undeservedly underrated. Theoretically and cognitively, Hypercube pushes boundaries where the first doesn't tread; the first relied on shoddy plot devices and banal dialogue (""You Nat-zee!""  ""You!  Woman!"") to further the psychosis, whereas the second used the unpredictability of the situation to develop plot. Granted, the second had a few lacunae in logic and plot, but it was far cinematographically superior.  The stark colors and environs conveyed a sense of claustrophobia that the original didn't; furthermore, the use of color was by far more symbolic in the sequel.  In the original, the color was simply random and chaotic -- and, worse, unexplained.My $0.02:  Hypercube earns a 9 for imagination and scope.  Cube earns a 6 for slipshod photography, dialogue, and plot gaps.Buy, rent or download Hypercube if you want an immersing experience.

Cube? More like square root...,"I was very disappointed by this film. The concept is a good one, and the booby-traps are in many cases very effectively portrayed (particularly the first one, but who the hell was that guy anyway?)I agree that it is reminiscent of The Twilight Zone, but certainly not the better episodes. There's an interesting premise with no real payoff. Clearly the Cube is supposed to be some type of a prison (clue #1, all the characters are named for famous prisons), so why should there be any chance of getting out of it in the first place? Where are all the other prisoners? I can understand no guards, but no food or water? While everyone has a 'special talent' that allows them a chance for escape if they pull together, what exactly is the purpose of the cop character? In the long run, he certainly does not assist in any way... far from it.For me, the really good Twilight Zone episodes setup a very interesting premise and completely change your initial impression by the end of the program. There was no 'twist', no 'startling revelation',no big 'payoff'... it just sort of ends. And to be honest, by that point I was pretty much glad that it did.

It was clever that each member had something to contribute to the puzzle itself in navigating their way round.From a psychological perspective, you can see why certain types would lose their nerve and go all psycho in a confined space.For me, there is just something about movies like this that are well done, low budget and unknown or up and coming actors.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unique film...,"1st watched 3/24/2001 - 6 out of 10(Dir-Vincenzo Natali): Unique film about people who find themselves trapped in a contraption that turns out to be somewhat like a moving Rubik's cube. Personalities clash, people change both from good to bad and bad to good, from worthless to having much worth while the cube continues it's consistent pattern.  The people are left to figure out this puzzle.  The movie is worth something because it is very thoughtprovoking and you wonder what the thinking is behind the makers of this film. The playing out of the film is sometimes ok, sometimes not, but that doesn't really matter because there seems to be a bigger purpose to this whole thing(maybe).",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Right mood and atmosphere, but not so strong performances","""That's the real challenge. You've gotta save yourselves from yourselves.""Shot in only 20 days with a hand-held camera in a single 14'x14' cubical set and a very low budget, this minimalist Canadian sci-fi horror film has become a cult favorite for many. Directed in 1997 by Vincenzo Natali, this was his first feature film and it still remains as one of his most popular ones, although Splice has also been warmly received by critics and seen by many more people thanks to its much bigger budget. He's also directed several TV series, including Hannibal which in my opinion stands out for its cinematography. Natali also co-wrote this original script with Andre Bijelic and Graeme Manson (creator and producer of another hit series, Orphan Black). For its minimalist approach, Cube does manage to stand out and deliver several thrills along the way, but five minutes into the movie I feared I knew what direction the story was heading, and unfortunately it did, so it was a bit of a letdown. However the journey was quite a pleasant and gripping one, so the movie did flow at a strong pace and I was engaged with it original premise.The film begins with a man (Julian Richings) waking up inside a cube-shaped room without any recollection as to how he got there. There is one door on every side of the cube, leading to other same shaped rooms although with different colors. According to the suit he's wearing his name is Alderson. As he leaves one of the rooms and enters a new one he is sliced into small pieces by a trap consisting of thin wires. We later discover that there are more people in the cube when a small group of them find each other in one room. A police officer named Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint), an architect named Worth (David Hewlett), a doctor named Holloway (Nicky Guadagni), an escape artist named Rennes (Wayne Robson), and a mathematician named Leaven (Nicole de Boer) all seem to have woken up in the same condition as Alderson and they are fighting their way through this maze trying to avoid the traps hidden in some of the rooms. They seem to have nothing in common as their personalities completely differ from one another, and they have no idea who could've put them in such a place. They do decide to stick together and try using their different talents to avoid the deadly traps as they move along through the maze looking for an escape. As the story unfolds and these characters begin interacting with one another tension and suspicion begin to rise among them.David Hewlett who has worked with Vincenzo Natali in all his feature films gets one of the lead roles here along with Maurice Dean Wint and Nicole de Boer. The performances in this film are the weakest link. Some of the dialogue scenes seemed forced and most of the characters' interactions felt unauthentic. The greatest problem was that most of these characters behaved in an inconsistent manner and the pressure they go through isn't a convincing reason for it. Quentin's character is the one who goes through the strongest transformation here and I just didn't feel it was natural. Other than the performances and the predictable finale, I did enjoy this small film and found the premise quite inventive despite its simplicity. With a stronger cast this could've been a great sci-fi horror film because Natali excels at setting the right atmosphere which creates a thrilling environment. The mood of this film reminded me a lot of Saw and I'm sure it was inspired by Natali's work.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Poor characterisation detracts from original idea,"Cube, while wholly original and engaging, suffers from one major flaw, its characters.As a concept, the film is faultless. Take 5 different people from different backgrounds and place them into a void of uncertainty and the unknown. From scene to scene they have to interact and help each other in order to discover a way of escaping from the spiders web. To an extent aswell, the film delivers on this level. Tension is created between the character (if seemingly manufactured and false at times) is present, the five stereotypes realise their difference, their weaknesses and their strengths and continue on in their plight. As a background to this, the concept of the Cube, a squared prison that these people have been unknowingly placed in serves to as to the mysterium of the story. We 'are' drawn in and we 'are' intrigued. So where does the film falter? Characters.When I watched this film, I found that out of the five different characters, only one seemed remotely likeable and real. That character being Leaven, wonderfully acted by Nicola De Boeur. Aside from Leaven's innocent, yet intelligent mind, we are left with four wholly unlikeable people whose only purpose in life seems to be to hinder and to annoy. Quentin, the stereotypical black cop. Brutal, family man who beat his children but who snaps at the slightest twinge. Holloway, the paranoid, neurotic doctor who seems to spend every waking hour of her days dreaming up far fetched conspiracy theories. Worth, the designer of the exterior who feels that it isn't important to tell everyone that he knows what they are inside, when quizzed as to why not, ""I didn't ask"" is the lamest and most wholly selfish reply anybody could give. And finally, Kazan, the mentally handicapped, who despite the morals of the story, does act as a liability. His only use is to turn everyone against each other. When his purpose is finally revealed, even then he serves to turn person against person.This is a story about characters. The only trouble is, we need characters we can identify with, not characters who we deplore. It almost seems fitting that the only person to escape from the Cube is the one person who has the least chance of making it on the outside.Great idea. Bad characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of those films by which you will judge others..,"A fantastic film.  Imagine going to bed, and then waking up in a futuristic cube-shaped room, in overalls, with odd faraway mechanical noises, and nearly (ingeniously) killing yourself when you try to explore/climb into the identical room next door.This film goes into a very short list of 'films you will forcefully drag all your friends to see'.  If they ask questions - slap them.  The people stuck in this situation don't have any answers, and you're supposed to be as clueless as they are. (That goes for a lot of films actually).I especially like the way your (viewer) loyalties switch as the film plays out.  And we can't not mention the astonishing first few minutes.If you call yourself a sci-fi or horror fan, there's simply no excuse for not seeing this.  It makes me physically ache when I see people browse past it in the music/video store.  I can't tell how mortified I was to see it reduced in a sale recently.  It's one of VERY few videos worth paying full price for. (I'm stopping soon).  What's more, it's one that you will understand on different levels in subsequent viewings, and despite the minimalism (of everything in the film!) you'll see little extras every time you watch.Can't wait to see what they do with Cube 2: Hypercube (but I am very glad it's not a prequel or sequel, rather 'another go from a different direction').",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not too bad, coulda done hell of a lot better","The overall sense I got when watching this film  was that it was an interesting concept shackled by low budget and B-list actors.The concept itself, total strangers waking up on the floor of a 14 ft square cube, surrounded by deadly traps and with no idea what to do, bodes well. The problem is that it soon becomes clear that all of the characters are deadly dull and formulaic, and that we're not actually gonna see many rolling heads. Worth a mention is the doctor (I forget her name) who, whether by design or appaling scripting, is one of the most annoying characters in any movie, ever.The way they circumvent the traps too (I won't give it away here) is totally random, it's like the writer had no idea how to do it, so went back to school textbooks to try and come up with something vaguely scientific. The problem is that when they're having arguments over it, it just sounds stupid and contrived.Personally, I'd have rather see a few more intricate traps rather than the moderately poor collection that we get to see, a few more deaths (although obviously that'd involve paying more actors).Worth a watch due to the strength of concept and pure sci-fi-ness of it all, but could have been so, so much better.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Terrible acting, terrible script, terrible movie","I have no idea what the hell the other reviewers of this move are thinking. This movie is essentially unwatchable. The acting is horrendous and the dialogue is stilted, unbelievable and ridiculous. Every character is a cliché to the point of being comical. The music and a lot of the camera-work is boring and unappealing. The editing is haphazard with cuts in strange places. The plot barely makes any sense and there is absolutely no pay off what so ever.The premise is somewhat original but is hampered by everything else. The only other saving grace is the special effects which are semi acceptable for a film of this budget and age. The film tries to deal with important subjects which other reviewers have mentioned, but does so in a terrible and uninteresting way.I can't overstate how bad this film actually is. It genuinely has some of the worst acting and dialogue I've seen in years.

"Great plot, but average acting","Worth delivered it, what unfortunately I can't say about the rest. All that matters is its' plot, storyline and concept of the movie. I can grasp the whole idea of what message the director was eager to convey, but yet there were some other undisclosed issues about this picture. For instance, the characters were not fully developed (probably it wasn't the main focus of the story, but whatevs), the purpose of this cube also wasn't clear - why these ppl were chosen to be put in there and who was liable for this mission. Finally, the acting... was really mediocre. I can understand that the initial budget was way too low, despite that, it turned out to be an iconic suspense! I really enjoyed watching it. It's really worthy, but don't pay attention to the acting part and some minor flaws related to the film. Regardless of them, it was a decent one.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Extreemly well written movie,"I love movies thats are like this, this is in many ways an anti-Hollywood movie, it has a small cast, no extras and a small set, original screenplay that I though had to be based off of a short story or novel but it wasn't - it was just a really good screenplay, a great idea. This movie succeeds very well exactly becuz its not a stupid indie horror crap nor a blockbuster bloated Hollywood hunk of garbage. I mean how much better can you get - take a handful of people, trap them in a cube make them figure out a way out, good twist with the characters and who gets out alive - of course it could have sucked and been stupid and boring with a premise like that but it wasn't it was really well executed.

Cool premise; poor acting.,"All things considered, this is a movie worth checking out if you're a fan of mind-bending sci-fi flicks and, more importantly, aren't turned off by terrible acting. And let me be clear; the acting is awful.Save for the guy who plays ""the Ren"" (or is it ""the Wren""?), I found every actor to be amateurish and oftentimes annoying. Subtlety isn't a strong suit for any of them, but neither is the ""over-the-top"" mode that a few of them seemingly default to. Unfortunately, this is a movie with a lot of dialogue and interaction between characters, so the poor acting is constantly in your face.To be fair, I'd never seen any of the actors (save for the Ren) in a movie prior to this one, which makes me think they might not've been very experienced when they made this movie. Also, I imagine the budget wasn't huge for this one, which probably limited the powers that be from hiring more experienced/talented actors. Still, it had to be mentioned.All that said, I think I'd recommend this to hardcore fans of sci-fi movies who value plot more than acting.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An interesting movie,"'Cube' is an interesting movie with thrilling moments and a great look. The movie looks so great that other things can feel a little disappointing although they are pretty good as well. The only thing that didn't impress me very much was the dialogue.A couple of people find themselves in a room in the shape of a cube. In every wall they see a door. Behind every door they find another room in the shape of a cube. Every cube has its own colored light, and every door has a number. How did they end up there, why are they there and why have some rooms deadly boobytraps? We don't know and the characters don't know, although they have their secrets.One of them is a cop, another is an escape artist. We have a doctor, a mathematics student, an autistic guy and someone who doesn't speak very much. Together they must survive and find out what is going on. Since the movie is set in a cube the entire time there are moments we can imagine what the characters are thinking and feeling. The dialogue in these scenes doesn't work because it doesn't add anything and therefore it seems in the wrong place.But like I said there is enough to enjoy here. The mystery is pretty nice and we only know what the characters know and that has its fun. Every time the characters enter a new cube we have a thrilling moment because we. and they, can't be sure if the room has a secret. Because 'Cube' is so different from the movies we normally see it is at least interesting to watch. Whether you like it as much as I did is for you to decide. In my opinion there is enough to enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Could've been so much more,"Creating an unreal sense of dream like paranoia, Cube had me enthralled. Expertly showing group theory, Cube opens with six individuals awakening in separate cubes. These cubes are connected via doorways on all six sides leading to other cubes, but some of them are trapped with death enducing blades, acid and so on. And therein lies the simple chilling mindset of the movie. You awaken in an unknown world with several other people using each of your skills and knowledge to survive. The cubes the characters travel through offer no answers to why they are there, no solace in their quest to survive. The movie had me picking sides with characters from the get go and showed the breakdown of the human mind under such conditions. But all this added up to what? Nothing and that's it. The ending is non-existent. There is no final explanation or grand scheme to it all, the movie jus stops from story telling and quits. I was waiting for a government cover up or something along those lines, but no, nothing.

But then comes the dialogue and the acting--  the whole ""people behaving, interacting, and subtly revealing their personal psychological worlds, thus hinting at greater universal truths about our wonderful and tragic existence"" part.

Enjoyment squared,"It was writer-director Vincenzo Natali's entertaining and bizarre Splice that drew my attention to his earlier work, and this is his debut feature: a low-budget Canadian sci-fi set entirely in an enormous cube, containing a series of smaller, room-sized cubes. A group of strangers awaken with no memory of how they became trapped. They need to find a way out - except some rooms are booby-trapped. Tension, conflict and madness ensues.Some have remarked upon the acting quality in the film, although I rather enjoyed the larger-than-life reactions of the characters. The film unashamedly embraces its own B-movie silliness. As the post-Saw horror genre has seemingly become a contest of escalating cruelty and gross-out money shots, a film whose thrills rely on inventive camera angles, imaginative narrative twists, and scarily unpredictable character mood swings seems almost quaint. But it works, thanks to its devotion to the puzzle at its heart and the descending psychology of those trying to solve it.The production design is simple (Natali's team built one cube and changed the wall colour to represent different rooms) and the make-up is effectively gruesome. It's the kind of movie where you'll be constantly questioning character motivations, but surrender to the ride and you'll find yourself enjoying a very neat cult gem.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

How on earth could someone just *forget* to explain how the people got there, or who is behind it all, or what is outside the cube? This movie is one after which the viewer is allowed to draw his or her own conclusions and use his or her own imagination.

I also found the reason for why the people were there to be weak (the cube exists to be used? Isn't that tautological?). I did like the idea that as a long-term project changes hands, it tends to have details lost in the shuffle. When it concerns human lives, that is a frightening thought.My friend told me about how they made this movie on a low budget mostly because they had special effects donated by two companies.

A Maze Of Technology,"Six people find themselves trapped in various small rooms, each in the shape of a 14'x14'x14' cube. They can walk around and talk, but if they try to move into an adjacent cube, they risk being annihilated by this or that unseen booby trap. They have no idea why they're here, or how they got here. Their obvious goal is to escape.Since almost all of the scenes take place in the cubes, the plot consists of efforts, and conversations on how, to escape. And there's lots of bickering. Dialogue is not especially clever or enlightening.Nor are the characters likable. A young girl is a too-brainy math whiz, convenient for trying to interpret various numerical digits in and around their confined space. One guy is a cop with an annoying attitude. An older woman is a doctor with a paranoid attitude.Given limited sets, the plot trends repetitive. Dialogue changes, but efforts to escape merely repeat, using alternate strategies. The film really, really wants to make a philosophical statement about modern human existence, but seems unable to express it. That humans are trapped in a maze of impersonal technology seems too obvious. I suppose viewers are expected to define for themselves the film's thematic import. Otherwise, the plot just seems to go round and round in a circle, then stops.A low-budget sci-fi film, ""Cube"" could easily be converted into a stage play. I didn't especially care for it. Characters are annoying. There's not much suspense. And the story seems somewhat pointless. Script aside, acting is acceptable. The background music is interestingly atmospheric. Sound effects are well done. And the constructed walls are pleasantly artistic.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Musings on Cube,"In a situation where the characters are unaware of why they are in the cube, each character's assertion is more of a revelation about themselves and their own prejudices. One claims that they are there for a rich man's kicks, another that a facility that size could only have been built by the 'military industrial complex'. Whist yet another that they have been abducted by aliens. It is one of the central horrors of the film that no attempt is made to explain the reasoning behind the tests they are put through. It is also its major success (especially when compared to the prequel Cube Zero) because it allows us to focus on the psychologies of our archetypal characters and the nature of human society.Quentin's own prejudices are laid bare in particularly brutal fashion. His eyes-down foot-forward approach to policing and belief in the system is shown to be moral irresponsibility, his authoritarian principles equated with simple misogyny, or more accurately a complete inability to relate to women. We see that this family man, with three children, is a simple brute. His assertion that he needs to get out for his kids in fact hides his base need to survive and dominate. This transition or unmasking is shown to harrowing effect when he proceeds to beat the architect with a boot, swinging it by its laces, as if he is brutalising a particularly naughty child. In a sense this is a highly feminist film or perhaps female chauvinist. The only three positive characters are two women and a severely mentally disabled man (an idiot savant).The cube is basically a metaphor. The architect's description of the building of the cube is vague and almost metaphorical. He describes a hideous bureaucracy in which people are only responsible for small parts of the construction and planning, and says that there really is no oversight for the project, it has simply become self-fulfilling. This is more a description of the ills of our sleepwalker society than a logical explanation for the genesis of the cube project. It is reminiscent of the dictum that whilst there may not be any evil bankers, the international banking system is evil.The simple premise of the movie is that the characters are trapped as much by themselves as by any diabolical machinery. They must group together to survive. All of this metaphor and philosophy aside, the movie is a masterclass in paranoia, horror and murders with a touch of elan. If if doesn't terrify you, one way or the other, you haven't a nerve left in your body.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Slice and dice.,"This insular horror/thriller makes excellent use of a single set to convey a much larger space, with each individual room combining to make a massive, deadly maze. After a cold open punctuated by a shocking moment of well-realised gore, 'Cube (1997)' focuses on a group of six individuals who must work together to figure out a way to escape from their current confinement. With a seemingly endless array of rooms, some of which are rigged with sadistic booby traps, and no form of nourishment, the group soon start to fall victim to fatigue and frustration. It's only a matter of time before someone cracks. Despite its clearly low budget and its amateur actors, the movie is a rather successful exercise in suspense and surprise. It features a number of rather inspired twists and turns, especially when it comes to what - or who - is actually an antagonist, and there are several edge-of-your-seat sequences that keep you engaged with the occasionally repetitive plot. Though some of their development is rather rushed and, as such, a tad unbelievable, the characters are all compelling in their own ways and carry the flick as an ensemble (there's no clear protagonist, at least not consistently). The most major problem with the picture is its often unconvincing acting, as it sometimes makes proceedings seem a bit camp and, therefore, contrary to the tone that's being aimed for. Still, most of it is at least passable and it can be overlooked thanks the the piece's proficiency in other departments. Overall, it's an enjoyable and engaging experience that makes good use of its limited budget and has an unexpected but welcome element of allegory to it. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Entertaining and mysterious classic,"After being introduced to a great opening scene that straight up shows the viewer what is going to expect them for the next 90 minutes, we follow a group of strangers who are trapped in a giant cube. Each cube has six little escape shafts that lead to even more cubes and some of these are equipped with booby-traps. Now our cast has to find out which cubes are booby-trapped, how they escape these cubes and why they were chosen for this.This movie has such a simple premise but manages to be fully entertaining for its runtime and have the viewer on the edge of their seats. Even though the budget was rather low the effects look mostly great, sure some of the CGI looks dated but considering that the movie is from 1997 I think the overall look is pretty awesome. The movie is equipped with interesting characters that all have their special traits and it is interesting how their characters react to certain stressful situations. This is a great suspenseful horror flick that gained cult-status and I tend to re-watch it every now and then and if you haven't seen it yet I definitely recommend to try it.

I really like this flick,"Strangers wake up in a cube like trap that they must escape. Every room is identical to the last with 4 doors in each room that takes them into the next room, basically identical to the rest. The problem here are not only that SOME of these rooms are booby trapped to kill the ones who enter, but the majority of the rooms are a puzzle. Acting isn't the best here. It reminds me a lot of Saw 2. (Which had better acting) The people's personality changes in the cube. Good guys become suspicious and bad guys become worse. I recommend this movie. Part 2 isn't nearly as good but worth the watch, and at this point you might as well watch the 3rd installment as well were we learn more about the operations going on behind the cube. All in all I give this movie 4/5**** and the trilogy as a whole 3.5/5** worth the watch (some parts are pretty bad but the good overshadows the bad.) A worthy entry in the trilogy game. I recommend this movie for sure. The other 2 will sorta be up to the viewer. Hope this helps!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A surprising study,"The story in this movie seems simple, but it's the kind of story that could go in any direction. Several people find themselves in a series of room, many of which are booby trapped. This fact is presented to us before any of the characters themselves, so there's no surprise to us that they face danger at every turn. The suspense of this, and the fact that there are no Hollywood stars around keeps the viewer not knowing who may die and how.Beyond this simple fact, there are the relationships that develop between and among characters. While a truly thoughtful writer could have carried this aspect in other directions, the story here keeps those moments restrained. The script is very effective in moving things along, with a few contrived leaps in logic, but it's all in the characters, and it just so happens that they're right. Imagining myself in the same situation, I can't believe that I would automatically assume myself to be inside a giant cube formation, but in this film, and each of the following ones, that assumption is made by the characters without enough clues to work with.The mixture of personality types is intriguing and turns out to be key to the movie. Each character is presented well enough, although none of the acting stands out. Then, this movie isn't about acting, it's truly all about the suspense of moving from one room to another, and trying to outthink the characters as they reach their conclusions about the purpose of the whole thing.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent low budget indie,"This movie was a very well done, low budget, indie flick. It kept my attention. It was well produced and the acting was decent. The thing that I thought was the most impressive, was the whole movie was shot entirely on one small stage, the size of the cell the actors were in. Each scene used the same stage, set up to be the current cell the actors were in. This helped the crew to run on a shoestring budget. Genius!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Perilous Pythagoras Puzzle.,"Seven strangers awake in a cubical maze, each with a different attribute that may or may not hold the key to getting out alive. For this maze is rigged with deathly traps, one wrong move or sound can bring a horrible death. They must work together or face the consequence, but why are they here? And just what is this point of this highly built construction?.We open with a quite brilliant scene that ranks up with the best of horror moments from the 1990s. We are introduced to the Cube and its intricate perils, it's the only set we are going to see for the next 90 minutes. Our characters start filtering thru, each of different social standing, and each with a surname linked to famous prisons. They argue about their reasons for being there, throwing up ideas on why someone has selected them for this atrocious ""game"" and who may be watching them. What we do know, is that it's us that is watching them, we are privy to human beings acting like ""rats in a fiendish maze"".I would suggest any prospective newcomer to Cube do little to no research prior to viewing it. Knowing little can surely only enhance the experience. Not in anyway hindered by a marginal budget, and benefiting greatly from having a cast of unknowns fill out the piece. Cube is an intelligent, yes horrific at times, voyeuristic gem of a movie. The mystery element holds tight right the way thru, the characters get more interesting with each frame and the outcome does not annoy like so many other genre pieces have over the years. Co-written and directed by Vincenzo Natali, the film has gained a massive cult following since it's late 90s release. And rightly so. For this is excellent thought provoking stuff. The kind the genre could do with far more often. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fascinating, but with a smart-ass and silly ending",I found this film gripping and fascinating.A mystery and clues that emerge along the route.You see the dynamics of the group and how it evolves.How do people behave under pressure? But I had also expected that there would be some sort of coherent explanation.At the end it just ends and you are supposed to see that as clever.Really there is no explanation.Just a hint of an absurd answer which It spoiled my belief in the story as a whole.I did not believe it.Stylish but in the end incoherent.,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Remember: It's allegory,"Several people are whisked away in the night, stripped, clothed and left in a maze. When they wake up, they find themselves in a 14x14x14 room, all six sides have small door that leads to another room just like the last except sometimes it is a different color and sometimes it is a death trap. Why are they in this maze? Who put them in there? What is the purpose? No one knows. Eventually the captives find one another. No one has met the other before but, united with the common goal of freedom, they continue to brave their way into the next room, looking for the exit.Cube is a social commentary. The mixed reviews come from the fact that the entire premise is allegory for our society and not really a horror flick; though it is pretty suspenseful at times. Even 25 years later, the script mirrors our society perfectly.Whats out there? Endless human stupidity... still.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Cube: Full of Holes,"A low budget Canadian psychological thriller, Cube has garnered a cult following and something of a legacy in popular culture. After a long time, I finally got around to seeing this interesting looking film today.Deeply mysterious, Cube chronicles the story of seven different people as they travel through an apparently endless system of interlinked cube structures with six doors each to adjacent cubes. Relying on each others' individual characteristics and skills to get them through, they desperately attempt to escape their geometric hell.With a single claustrophobic set used for shooting , one undeniable thing about Cube is the originality of its premise. Reworking the concept of the maze thriller in all sorts of new dimensions, it brings an interesting newness to the subgenre. The potential presented in the early scenes of the film is large; the opening scene immensely entertaining and indicative of good things to come from the original and intriguing concept. The implementation of this idea is, however, cripplingly flawed. Suffering painfully all the faults of clunky and unrealistic dialogue, the film does little to improve it with some substandard performances. The characters, though mildly interesting, seem to react in entirely absurd ways at times, doing much to detract from the audience sympathy vote: Kazan, an autistic character, is often just offensively portrayed; Leaven, the ""math whiz"", takes her time in trying to decide if multiples of 5 and 2 are prime numbers. The film is full of holes and massive flaws, turning it from a film of considerable potential to, at times, an infuriatingly contrived work. All that aside, it is actually quite enjoyable once you accept and expect its regular absurdity. Plot twists are painfully obvious, but the path to them is at least a fun one to tread, some of the tensions rising between characters interesting, if not effective or believable. Though it does little to establish itself as a particularly good movie, it's at least not a terrible one.With flaws aplenty, many of them just silly and stupid, Cube falls flat on its face more than once, suffering regularly from its less than convincing dialogue and unintentionally funny developments. Entertaining all the same, it's certainly original.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Original thriller,"An original and thrilling indie Canadian mathematical and psychological thriller with some horror moments.A group of five people -4 males and 2 females- found themselves, like by magic, trapped in a cube-capsule within a gigantic Kubrik-ish labyrinthine cube, and are trying to escape from it. The presence of all the characters is necessary as any of their personal skills and personalities are going to be necessary to solve the mystery. Mathematics play an important role in deciphering how to get from a cube to another within being killed, and to escape from the big cube. The movie is claustrophobic, unsettling and full of mystery.The whole concept and idea is brilliant, especially if we take into account that was shot in 1998 and that is still refreshing and captivating today. However, the plot has important flaws. Who built the cube? Why was built for? Who keeps it running or it moves itself? Why were the members of the group chosen and not other people with the same skills? How were they taken to the cube? Who is responsible for this? Are they dreaming? Are they mice-like characters in an experiment? I found the general acting mediocre, with the only exception of Adrew Miller who is great as the autistic savant. Especially bad are Maurice Dean Wint as Quentin, and Nicky Guadagni as Dr Helen Holloway, their performances really ruining the movie and the believability of their respective characters.I enjoyed the movie tremendously, so very entertaining and mentally engaging, but the flaws in the plot and the bad acting are too important not to consider them when rating it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Complex but rewarding and under-appreciated horror movie,"A group of strangers are trapped in a giant maze made of cube shaped rooms with various deadly traps. They are trying to find their way out through the giant labyrinth of traps, riddles and twists which would make the makers of Saw jealous. The cube maze the characters are in represents this movie: Twisty, dense, complex and pretty darn confusing. This is a critically ignored movie which later gained a cult following and deservedly so. Like many B movies, it starts out shaky. Its characters leave you cold and it keeps repeating itself. It also has its various detours into generic B movie clichés which weaken the film and it goes from set piece to set piece without ever delivering a knockout punch. However, the film improves as it progresses. The characters become more developed, different layers are revealed and information is revealed in a structured and clever way. The set pieces get more and more heart in mouth and ultimately Cube gets as much as it can out of its generic but brilliant premise.A mature decision was to leave much of what goes on ambiguous and the film thankfully doesn't have a major reliance on gore. It does get rather claustrophobic although after a while we get used to the setting. Cube is one of those movies where you're in the trap for the whole thing, and no sighting of the outside world means it feels a bit more artificial but this adds to the tension at the same time. The acting improves as the film goes on and although the cast still seem to be unknown, they do a good job. The director doesn't seem to be too prolific which is a shame as there's clearly plenty of talent here. The script doesn't do anything special but it tells the story decently and spits out the many twists with admirable effort. Cube is not a great movie but it is a very interesting one and a likable albeit sadly obscure effort. If you ever get bored of watching Saw, this would definitely be a good alternative and it's good for anyone who likes puzzles. I doubt you'll be able to solve the puzzle in this movie though.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A clever example of low-budget sci-fi,"I guess you would have to classify this Canadian film as an example of how to intelligently make a low budget science fiction film. All too often cheap sci-fi movies end up falling under the bracket of film which can best be described as 'corridors in space' movies, i.e. lots of scenes of people running (and walking) up and down corridors (of the future). These movies are almost always deeply tedious, at least partially on account of their limited settings. What Cube cleverly does is use this handicap to its advantage, where the limited location is also kind of the point of the entire movie and part of its overall suspense generator. A group of people wake up and find themselves in a high-tech maze made up of giant inter-connecting cube shaped rooms; some cubes having deadly hidden traps situated in them. It is an imaginative and original idea for its time and it sure makes the most of limited budget by using its sets in this way.What it all boils down to is a puzzle movie where we follow a bunch of people trying to work out how they got where they are. It has the good sense to remain pretty enigmatic in many respects and not explain everything, and realising that it is often the questions which are more interesting than the answers. While there are a few memorably gory moments, the approach is very much more psychological and all the better for it. It is not a perfect film, as it suffers from some weak performances and the setting does - slightly - suffer from over-familiarity to at least some degree. But, on the whole, this is a commendably original bit of low budget sci-fi which deserves its cult status.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Intriguing premise, disappointing result","I ran across this movie in the videostore and the unusual, intriguing premise caught my attention. Being a fan of low budget movies I rented it. However, I have to say that the movie did not live up to my expectations at all.Inherent to its simplistic makeup is that the film solely rests on the characters and their relationships to one another. Unfortunately they all were awfully one-dimensional. The smart college girl, the evil tough guy, the cynic, the conspiracy theorist, and worst of all the retarded number genius- puh-lease!!

Very obvious clue's are given and all plot twists can be figured out beforehand without much effort.The characters were mono dimensional,without any effort to add any kind of a deep background.All in all a decent movie but it fell short on many levels.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A few graphic deaths but a fun movie with great characters,"I like how everyone in the movie played a significant role in their journey to escape this cube. The deaths are really nasty and they occurred if someone enters a room with a death trap. I liked that because it got my heart racing every time the group entered a new room after throwing a shoe (or themselves as we approach the end of the film).The solution to the puzzle was incredible too and to be honest I would have never thought of it if I was trapped there.There are some characters that I liked and a couple I disliked. The cop who later becomes a psycho, Quentin, played an okay leader of the group. Often times he would get frustrated with someone and curse them out. The young girl, Joan Leaven, started off as someone that needed to depend off of Quentin but as the movie went on, she was the one that figured out the puzzle. Joan couldn't figure out the last piece of the math puzzle; Kazan, the special needs person, did. I at first didn't like Kazan until his role actually helped the group. The ""Karen"" of the group, Dr. Holloway, often got into Quentin. Even though she was one that drove Quentin crazy, she persuaded him to keep everyone together and alive. Dr. Holloway also gave more character development and Joan was more brave to stand up against the sicko cop. The guy who claims he created the whole thing, David, was more useless as he believed that there wasn't a way out from his catastrophe. The guy who came up with the ""shoe"" strategy, Rennes, I liked and a little sad his time was quick. The very first guy featured in the film, Alderson, just showed us that there were rooms that killed you.The ending though I thought was very anticlimactic as the full answer to the puzzle was revealed and quite sad that Joan lost her confidence and agreed with David's belief. I also would like to know how there was a way into this maze if there was no way out.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Slightly Above Average,"Cube is nothing more than a decent way to kill time.  The general plot is not innovative in any way, but it is a least more creative than most horror/ sci-fi films these days.  Though the film itself suffers from one serious problem:  Repetition.  It's people walking through a series of booby trapped cubes.  It's cool at first, but after a while it begins to get tiresome. The writers probably figured you wouldn't notice because the film is supposed to be a character study of people placed under pressure, but that aspect of the screenplay is terribly cliche.  All the characters are generic and possess no real traits we can latch onto as an audience.  The screenplay is not necessarily bad, it's just not good.  It fits nicely in the average category.  The acting wasn't that bad.  I don't know what you people want, but I can think of tons of actors who could've done worse in the movie. They are a bunch of unknowns, sure, but that doesn't mean they are bad actors. It's not oscar material, but it's far from bad.    I like and am annoyed by the lack of closure in the film.  On one hand, it lets you the viewer develop your own decision about the meaning of the cubes, but it also demonstrates an element of languor on the part of the writers.It's a nice idea that burns itself out too quickly.  The screenplay is average, and the acting likewise.  It has some nice cinematography, and it entertaining enough to keep you awake.  It's not a masterpiece, but it is a little better than average.6.5/10* * 1/2    /   * * * *",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Creative paranoia, intense emotions","It's great when film makers are willing to take chances with their premise, to truly step outside the norms of reality and invent something that could never exists - well, almost never. The premise of this film could technically exist today. You could be knocked out one day and then wake up in a cubic metal room with six doors, one on each surface, with no idea where you are, where to go or even why you are there. You won't, but you could and you're able to imagine what that would be like. It's an extreme situation where the horrors and wonders of human kind will be unleashed, and that's the beauty of this film. It's a fascinating character study of people but into a situation that none of them ever expected, but which has become a reality for them.The film is able to carry its story through mood and tone alone. The use of lighting, shadows and colours masterfully strengthens the claustrophobic atmosphere and the illusion of walls closing in. Add in the grinding sound effects, the heavy breathing and the whispered dialogues and you have a setting that's impossible to escape. You, the viewer, are in the Cube, along with its inmates.Probably the only thing holding this movie back is the fact that while it has a very imaginative premise, nothing definitive is said about the human condition. The inmates will panic, they will flee, they will triumph, only to fail again, and so on, but the final point of all this is never reached. Why was this story told? What did the film makers try to convey? In the end, I'm not sure, but at the same time I don't really care. The journey alone was more than enough, even if the final goal was kind of vague.Any fan of thrillers and psychological horror should see this film. It's an intense experience and capable of transporting you outside of your everyday life, into an unbearable situation from which there seems to be no escape.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Amazing what can be done on a low budget,"This film begins as it goes on  gruesomely. A man wakes up in a strange room in the shape of a cube. There are doors on each of the six sides which lead to other cube-shaped chambers. He enters one of these rooms and something very nasty happens to him. Various other characters then turn up in this maze of booby-trapped cubes and the plot centres on their attempts to escape.Cube is a long way from being a perfect film. It is plagued by the kind of melodramatic over-acting that would be more at home in the theatre and by some very portentous dialogue. And the concept of throwing a bunch of people into a confined and dangerous position and seeing how they react is hardly the most original of ideas. On the other hand I found this an impressively disturbing, intense and generally intelligent film. The low budget was probably a godsend as it restricted most of the action to one set giving the film a very claustrophobic atmosphere, and also limiting the amount of distracting special effects.The combination of characters in Cube might seem contrived  we have a bullying cop, a compassionate doctor, a nihilistic `office worker', a geeky (but not too-geeky) maths student, an escaped escape-artist and an autistic man who, guess what, turns out to have amazing abilities that come in handy later on. While these characters are generally portrayed as stereotypes, the plot strongly suggests that there is more at work than a writer's wilful throwing together of a neat cross-section of society. Each character has skills or knowledge which could contribute towards the effort of escaping from the cube, and this sets up the central problem of the film. To escape they must work as a team, but the horror of their situation where a wrong move results in a highly unpleasant death, so alienates them from each other that they eventually become as much their own enemies as the monolithic cube in which they are trapped. Cube is clearly not a fan of the theory that people pull together in pressurised situations.For me the fact that no final explanation was given for the existence of the cube or the presence of the people within it was a definite plus point  there are already far too many films in which (unlike reality) all the ends are neatly tied up. The possibility that it is all part of a government conspiracy is raised by one of the characters and thankfully dismissed. The idea of government conspiracies being behind everything has long ago ceased to be subversive and thought-provoking and has now entered the realm of banal cliché. The notion that someone out there knows what's going on and can be held responsible for events is, like most other vaguely comforting ideas, absent from this film. The question of what lies outside the cube remains as disturbingly unresolved as the question of what is going on inside.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The much-maligned ending was the best part, I thought. The entire meaning of the movie was in that last three or so minutes, and the music is incredibly creepy. What's remarkable about this movie is the feelings it provokes. I was terrified. It indulges in a fair amount of gore and violence, but that's not what was scary.

I had chills for days after I saw it. (Incidentally, the math does hypothetically work. The guys who made it went to their math professor, who has a Ph.D. in mathematics, and asked him to come up with a number system that would do all the things they needed it to do for the movie. He came up with a system that did all that for a ""cube"" that would be 25 X 25 rooms, but said that with the effort needed to progressively figure out if it would work for a cube the size of the one in the movie, he would be able to get another Ph.D. in math.)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Hopelessness,"The oppressive sense of hopelessness engulfs the viewer from the very first frame, like thick, sticky sludge. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what causes the panic - the uncertainty of how you ended up in the cube, the confined space, the increasingly evident sense of hopelessness, the threat of deadly traps, or perhaps the fear of imminent death in such a strange place. In Vincenzo Natali's directorial debut, these emotions are conveyed with startling accuracy and feel completely real. He created a cult film almost from scratch, one that rightfully deserves to be called a masterpiece of science fiction. It is a unique film that truly stands out in the genre, and this is in the best possible way.It's amazing how the crew managed to create such an impressive film with a very limited budget, especially considering that only one cube room was built for the filming, and they simply changed the colored panels on the walls, with the only working door. Despite this, the cast is well chosen, with each character becoming an inseparable part of the overall feeling of unease and uncertainty.Alongside the unfortunate victims of the Cube, the viewer inevitably asks: why were these people chosen, what might connect them, if anything, who created this place, and for what purpose? Is escape even possible? Many questions remain unanswered, and this only enhances the film, because not every question needs an answer. Not everything can be confined to logical boundaries; sometimes, room for reflection and interpretation is necessary.The highly original idea is masterfully brought to life by the director, prompting thoughts about the nature of enclosed spaces. The concept of the cube and the system of interconnected rooms with endless corridors is truly mind-boggling. Even the traps here can be seen as a less significant element, as the very confinement of the space, the uniformity of the rooms, and the complete lack of an exit cause the heart to literally stop. Maybe, James Dashner, who wrote the Maze Runner series, was partially inspired by this film, and that's completely justified. Cube is unique and serves as a catalyst for thought and imagination.This film strongly affected me many years ago when I first saw it, and watching it again today, I was once again immersed in the same emotions. Although, of course, taste is subjective, I don't understand why some people reject this film so categorically. In my opinion, comparisons with Saw are completely misplaced, as Cube has entirely different conditions, reasons, and scope. The first part of the franchise is rightfully considered the best, and despite its lack of closure, it is fully self-sufficient.

"Brilliant concept, but suffers from bad/mediocre acting","The plot in ""Cube"" is as simple as it gets. A bunch of strangers trapped in a huge cube-formed maze. But simple can also be good sometimes. I think this concept is brilliant and very original. If you're a fan of original sci-fi movies, I really think you'll enjoy this one. It quickly catches your attention, and doesn't let go until it's over.The only setback is the acting. In my opinion the acting is poorly done, or at least mediocre at it's best. Especially the Quentin-character kept annoying me. I didn't really ""believe"" him. This is too bad, because it takes some of the focus away from the plot.Still, I really liked ""Cube"". If you don't mind the low-budget, and can live with some bad/mediocre acting, you should watch it. It's still a good movie, and it offers something different.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

a first class example of how to make an interesting movie on a tight budge,"This is a first class example of how to make an interesting movie on a tight budget. This is a very interesting and fascinating movie. A small group of people find themselves trapped in a large cube with no explanation as to how they got there or why they are there. To make matters worse, the cube is full of booby traps. The remainder of the movie is spent trying to figure out how they got there and how to escape. The acting is OK but not exactly great and some of the explanations as to what the cube was and how they got there don't quite satisfy but overall this was a different and enjoyable movie. If you like TV shows like the Outer Limits and the Twilight Zone then you'll probably like this.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pseudo intellectual excuse for physical and emotional violence,"The quality of the dialogue in this movie rivals Plan 9 from Outer Space. The character development clunks along like a high school creative writing project.  One character ""Wren"" is developed in about three sentences and then killed off to create an ""irony"" that he was the escape artist and was the first to die. The ""cop"" inexplicably decides to let go of the hand of the doctor and let her drop to her death.  No explanation, no reason. Solely to set up the irony of the protector being the killer and the shock of watching a character die. The movie still rates a four rating because the set design and the cube concept were interesting and the editing and camera work were excellent.  The acting, script, and plot line were abysmal.  As soon as the idiot savant character is introduced, you know that he will be the one to solve the mystery.  I was so offended by the movie I couldn't watch the end.

"CUBE--Makes you think, or lets you watch","ok, before i get started, i must say this is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen. it so good, i recommened that everyone see it.now, let me get into why it is so amazing. you can watch this movie and be totaly confused the whole time and not understand anything thats going on, and come out of it totaly messed up, but in the end, u had a great time. u could also go into this movie ready to think, and become so engrossed in it that u probably wont sleep for a week.  now, being a  middle schooler when i first saw it, i had to watch it a few more times before i could understand the full picture. the music in this movie is soo good, and soo creepy that i mute the tv almost everytime. it adds... something very strong to this movie.  its sooo creepy, yet so simple, that i dont understand completely why its there, but i know the movie would be dead without it the lack of budget works for this movie. i must say that only having one room and just changeing the lights was so absolutly genious that i swear, if i were ever in a room that looked like that, i'd kkill myslef. they say canadains cant make movies, i say americans cant wacth movies.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Great concept, poor execution","The concept of this movie is brilliant -- for no particular reason, people are imprisoned inside an enormous puzzle box littered with deadly booby traps.  They have no food or water and will die in a few days unless they find their way out, using clues left for them to figure out which rooms are death traps and which are safe.  The film taps into common human fears: claustrophobia and starvation; faceless, malevolent industry and government; and killer technology.  The sets are creepy and industrial -- the characters seem to be getting chewed up inside a giant machine.Unfortunately, the movie has deep flaws.  The acting is mostly uninspired and the dialogue is uninteresting.  The second half failed to deliver on the promise of the first half, and the ending is a throwaway.

"Cube is a fascinating, low-budget sci-fi thriller","Cube is a fascinating, low-budget sci-fi thriller that makes the most of its minimalist setup. The concept is simple but incredibly effective, a group of strangers trapped in a deadly maze of cube-shaped rooms. The movie thrives on its tension and psychological undertones, diving into how humans react under extreme pressure. It's a smart, inventive film that doesn't spoon-feed answers, leaving you to wrestle with its deeper themes about survival, human nature, and systems of control. While the traps and puzzles are memorable, the true focus is on the characters and how they clash as their desperation grows.That said, the film isn't without its flaws. The constant use of tight close-ups and high focal lengths creates an almost unbearable sense of claustrophobia, but not always in a good way. At times, the cinematography feels disorienting and can pull you out of the moment. Combined with some uneven performances and occasionally stiff dialogue, these elements might not work for everyone. Still, Cube is a must-watch if you enjoy tense, thought-provoking thrillers that make you question everything by the time the credits roll. It's the kind of movie that sticks with you, even if it leaves you a little shaken.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretty good,"This little movie was a lot of fun.  I recognized some of the dialogue(the ""nobody is in charge"" speech) because it's been sampled in industrial music. The Cube can work as a metaphor on so many levels, it's brilliant. Existentially, it represents the mystery of life, at once cold and rewarding.  The movie made me wonder if everything really wasn't like a big Tetris game.  Maybe things being round and organic is just an illusion, or the way we prefer to look at them.  Maybe in this movie the world really is flat (on the top of the Cube, and the people trapped inside are in Hell!). The Cube DOES revolve, sort of.  I know I'll have to see this movie again.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Underrated,"'Cube' seems to have gone down better in the UK than at home, judging by the critics.I was impressed enough to see it twice, at consecutive screenings. It's an intelligent film - the concept isn't novel but the setting is (and let's put in a word for the terrific design of the cubes). Sure, the characters may be stereotypes but their interactions are not so predictable (you don't expect the leader to lose control and turn nasty, for example). Similarly, the dialogue sometimes leaves a lot to be desired (too much ""oh my God!' and ""of course!"") - but how would you talk in the same situation?As to the ""why?"" of it all, I don't see it as a cop-out, as some reviewers have suggested. The fact is, there IS no ""why"", as Worth patiently explains. There IS no conspiracy, there IS no brain behind it - it's a big corporate mistake. Only those desperate for another X-Files Big Conspiracy Theory should be disappointed by this explanation.As for the characterisation, the film suffers (as does 'Seven') from not having enough time to develop its characters properly. But to do so would have generated even more talk, and would probably have got boring. Besides, nobody complained that we didn't really know who Mr Blond was in 'Reservoir Dogs'.'Cube' resembles 'Event Horizon' in its situation and the horror of its exposition - but where 'Event Horizon' just gave us a series of iconic figures to be dispatched in a 'Who's next?"" exercise, 'Cube' bothers to give us more. I found myself caring about the characters, I responded positively to the structural approach, I admired the production design and I was regularly surprised. You can't ask for much more from a first feature, and I look forward to seeing Natali's future work.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Enough to give you nightmares for a week.,"I have read so many people moaning about this films lack of closure, failure to answer some of the questions it poses. In my opinion, these people have missed the entire point. One of the characters actually says ""you can't see the big picture from in here, you gotta concentrate on what's in front of your face!"". That's exactly where this films strength lies, you are trapped throughout along with the characters. You don't even get to glimpse the outside world at the beginning. Instead you are thrust straight into the disturbing and claustrophobic plot. If you thought that the truman show was smart or original then think again... If you are after gore then you'll get plenty of the red stuff. If you're after laughs then sure, there's one or two... but most of all, if you are after nightmares and thoughts plagued for days with the intricacies of a tidy, intelligent, and utterly edge of seat movie then this is the film for you. 5 out of 5 just for not pandering to the masses.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Suddenly the end came & that was it. We were all left with just 2 words. 'What the'? What?I don't mind films where you interpret your own ending at all, but this was silly. If you take it to the extreme, it won't be long until a film where people interpret the whole thing.I hated Blair Witch Project, due partly to the unresolved ending, but at least with that, if anyone tells you about the film, most peoples interpretations, though different, will tend to resolve most of the issues. This didn't.I can see all the messages behind this. The reflections of society, the anger & hostility, the many prison allusions etc etc. That was all very good. But there must have been a better way of tackling it whilst at least tying up some of questions but keeping the same themes.I didn't have a problem with never finding out how they arrived in the cube. That point gradually became less & less relevant but they could have resolved the why? & the who? questions.I would rather watch a crap film with a botched rushed ending than a magnificent film (which is what this was) with that same ending. The Quentin character also lost this film a mark. He'd become a pain up the arse by the end.Still, the whole concept is amazing, I was gripped throughout and am now excited for the Cube 2 film & also seeking out films on a similar concept to this. But that's really in the hope, that they will be tackled AND RESOLVED better than this one.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Living in a booby-trapped box,"Similar in theme to the later 'Saw' franchise in which seemingly random, unsuspecting everyday-folks find themselves in a sadistic gamified experiment, 'Cube' uses its limited resources highly effectively, pacing a straightforward plot with tension and suspense, and enough gore to keep horror fans excited.Bookish de Boer is the highlight amongst the cast playing the brains on which the otherwise hapless group rely to mastermind their escape. She alone is reason enough to watch this sci-fi thriller, and ensures it's something more than a modest movie minnow.Taut, economical direction and stark Kafkaesque sets reminiscent of vintage sci-fi films creates a cold, sinister aesthetic which is only let-down by the painfully banal dialogue and some uneven characters.

"""The Cube"" Was Designed To DISAPPOINT!","The Cube was a movie i wasn't holding my breath for. Although the concept of the story sounded interesting i could just tell it would be a major dissapoinment. So i sat through the movie and there's one thing i will admit and give this movie. The first 30 minutes are well done, you are drawn into the creepy world of the Cube. The actors are scared, and things seem in place. Yet as time proceeds past the half an hour mark the film just collapses right there- and i was expecting it too. There are many plot holes in the film. I mean i think msot people sat through this sorry excuse of a film to actually end up with a conclusion and to find out what the deal was with this CUBE. Yet our demands are unheard of in the movie.There are many flaws. Most noticeably was the acting. These bunch of unknowns couldn't act their way out of a plastic bag. Okay sure, the script they were given was pathetic but couldn't they see how stupid this film made them look? So the film had a budget i knew that- So the film was shot using the same one set, okay i'll buy that but WHY couldn't they add 5 extra minutes of dialogue to help explain what the hell the Cube is and how they go there? WHY couldn't they have added another 5 minutes of screen time for an actual ENDING? And WHY OH WHY did one of the characters absolutely lose my mind and mess the whole plot up? I guess the only answer i have for the ""Cube"" was that it was mainly designed to disappoint.Below Are my conclusive reviews.ACTING: Terrible. The entire cast flunked. Even the retard was barely retarded. I dont even remember the characters name, yet the african/canadian man in the film was appaling. The Math Genius was really bad. Maybe if they were given better scripts....Oh no forget it! Thats just an excuse they cant act.ACTORS: Sorry i don't know these bunch of so called ""Actors"". Not only did the film have BUDGET written all over it, so did the actors. I mean no character was likeable not absolutely one of them. Either they didnt play their characters right or their characters simply had nothing going for them. Bad choice. Sad fact even a BIG NAME actor wouldnt save this film.SCRIPT: Oh gosh where can i begin on this? Decent for the first 30 pages of screenplay- THEN it just falls apart right there and it hits you like a speeding bullet. There is no beginning and no end to this movie so dont expect and introduction or conclusion becase there is none. Dont expect to have the faintest idea what the Cube is and how the characters got there. Dont think you might as well sit through the whole movie for the ending because there is no ending, the film basically laughs at you at the end. Dont expect interesting characters, expect yourself to smile at their deaths. If you think you can figure out the reason for the box yourself or if the writer did it purposely for us to figure it out, not even Einstein would know this. Sorry the script is just horrid.CINEMA: Finally something DECENT about the film. I only mean decent, nothing revolutionary or special. Just thinking it was all the same set made me feel that they did put in some hard work for the sets. Yet parts of the cube and its special effects look very fake. Other times the Cube looks very eerie and almost puts you there. Yet to make it short decent Cinematography- nothing special.HORROR: Thing about ""The Cube"" was that it made me think it was stealing something from the Hellraiser films i cant exactly pinpoint WHAT it was copying but i got the scent of ""Unoriginal"" for parts of the film. There is good gore in the first half of the flick then they just try to leave you in suspense leaving the characters in many caught up situations, though i dont have time for that wish-wash, i didn't learn anything- so they all might as well have died in the most gruesome way possible but it didnt happen.MUSIC/SOUND: Ummmmmmmmmmmmmm. I dont remember much music in the film, maybe it didnt need it. Only thing you will hear is annoying characters screaming at eachother, the contant sound ""TSSSSSSSSH"" of the doors opening and a guy acting retarted screaming ""Aahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"" that it makes you feel like punching the screen- no pun.OVERALL: Basically there is nothing that gives this film firm structure, theres no backbone- there is nothing that keeps it standing on both of its feet and thats what sucks. After such a promising idea we are given a poorly executed film that only leaves me feeling angry. Looks like they are making a sequel too- how could there be a sequel to a film that had no ending? It's too late to explain it- theres no saving this film. Thats a fact.* 1/2 Stars (Out Of 5)",,Anonymous,Mystery

They don't know who put them in the cube, really, or why, and neither do we; we're left to ponder the meaning.

In the end it's just another mindless low budget sci-fi movie that is commonly overhyped and definitely over rated (I am amazed how it has the same score as 28 Days Later, which is an absolutely superb movie by Danny Boyle and far superior to Cube). Cube has already spawned a sequel that is nothing but more of the same, and it seems like it will spawn a prequel which may be a ray of hope for this trilogy if the screenplay evolves in quality. Cube is not the worst movie you will ever see though, it's entertaining and it does bring curiousity to see what happens in the end, but it's also not a work of art.

It uses logic very well - you really feel an affinity for the frustration of the characters, then you are trying to work out the reason why they are there and the noises and the strange markings and the reason some directions are good and some are not. Thus, it gets you involved in the action, it gets you involved in the thoughts of the characters, and you are trying to solve the puzzle with them. I truly can say it shocked me in places - one of the characters dies in a most surprising/impressive way, so much that you felt almost as scared as the characters.Truly a great film - to those who like horror/action/logic, well worth seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not vague enough?,"Some have complained that this movie left too much unexplained, providing too little background into why, where and how the characters came to be where they are. My complaint with this film is that it didn't leave enough unexplained. The anguished confession of one character's involvement in the cube's construction, combined with the conspiracy theories of the others, unpleasantly reminded me of ""The Andromeda Strain"", another film in which what could have been an excellent science/philosophy thriller was spoiled by political ranting. I would have enjoyed it more if the characters had been in more of a vacuum, with less connection to the outside and more time spent exploring the nature of the cube and their place in it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Watchable....once!,"The concept is a splendid one, and the pace and interest is quite well maintained, but two things stop this being as good as it could be. The first problem is the acting which, to be honest, is rather poor. The characters may be constrained by a weak script, but the passion and emotion is all from the Rambo school of films rather than the more appropriate Silence of the Lambs school. The second problem is the ending. I have a horrible feeling that it is all meant to be religious in its significance (help!) but it is so wet and so opaque that I really felt annoyed at the dozen of so guesses I had made at the Cube's significance during the film. This was a film setting a puzzle and giving no solution. My attempts at the infamous Rubik's Cube in the eighties were just as fruitless so, maybe, this film was just one big clumsy allegory of that?!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Canadian Cube of terror,"This low-budget Canadian science-fiction movie is truly one of the most original thrillers I have ever seen. It deals with a couple of people each with their own specific talent imprisoned in a world of deadly rooms. The many boobytraps hidden in each cube are enough to alarm even the bravest person and they soon begin to lose their patience as well as their hope in getting their lives back.The entire movie is basically one huge mission to make it out of the huge cube alive. The fact that each room has a devious trap in store and the wide diversity of the many characters make up for a very enjoyable movie. Every now and then: you are presented with unusual camera shots which adds to the already creepy atmosphere. The movie begins for example with a close-up shot of someone's eye. Near the end: you do happen to have the feeling that you've seen everything and any presentation of a new room actually feels more like a stretch than an interesting plot development. Fortunately: they don't drag the movie on for too long and the ending has an okay twist.Being a low-budget movie in Canada, one might expect that ""Cube"" doesn't have a single famous actor. Not to worry, because all acting is quite good. There are at least two performances that are worth mentioning here. Maurice Dean Wint plays the part of Quentin the cop and he's quite good. The best acting however is by Andrew Miller who plays the role of Kazan the autistic man. Andrew Miller is no Dustin Hoffman so don't expect a Rainman-performance, but his acting is easily the best thing alongside the eerie atmosphere and originality of this beautiful thriller.In short: If you want proof that good movies don't always come from millions of dollars - check this one out! It's as good as any low-budget movie could ever be!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

the existence and escape of an inescapable prism - one of the smartest sci-fi/horror films of the 90s,"A fully realized but perfectly mysterious environment is created in Cube. It's a system that is hard to fathom, an intricate one but seemingly simple with the use of mathematics, but the human element, really, is the thing that keeps the characters not able, until the last fifteen minutes, to really get themselves together and get out of this 'place' that may have been created by humans or aliens or even cyborgs, or nobody at all.Cube is a great film about people with their own 'personalities'; it's appropriate, and a sweet touch, to have the opening title to homage Ridley Scott's Alien, as it's about a group of people thrust together who get picked off one by one in a claustrophobic environment. Only this time, with its set-up like the beginning of a new life itself, and the people each reflecting a stand-point that can help, damage or be neutral to the chances of escape, there's no one real ""villain"" except each other.Vincenzo Natali takes the audience by the brain and doesn't let go - not the balls, mind you, though if he wants those he can get them from time to time. This is about as close to a science fiction 'No Exit', or a translation of ideas from multiple philosophers like Nietzsche and Descartes (the latter name-dropped in the film and used as a basis for mathematics), but as 'brainy' science fiction it doesn't kid those looking for just a pulse-pounding horror film either. And for anyone wanting to compare this to Saw, by the way, break it down this simply: Cube is smart, Saw is stupid. Saw starts with a semi-clever premise and shatters it with shoddy and ludicrous storytelling and characters that no one can care about. In Cube, it's just so bizarre and mechanically inspired a set-up that the characters have to be rich to keep things interesting - and they really are.Cube will make you think while it has scenes of sensationalized killings, but they're not very rampant or frequent, and rely on what we know is going to happen and taking time with the scene- or just springing the unexpected trap. The opening scene, for example, is a staggering example of taking an audience right off its feet, much like when one first sees the chest-burster in Alien; when the guy goes into the room, and we think we hear or see something *swipe* downward, only to suddenly notice that the man's entire body has been sliced into a dozen pieces, it slowly dawns on us what is going on - and if your jaw doesn't drop at that, I don't what to do for you. Or, on top of this, good old fashioned suspense with the group of guys and gals going downward into the room that can be triggered by a single voice-sound.If there's any one minor flaw it could be that a couple of the performances needed some tweaking, or perhaps went a little 'too much' in their intended paths. These two I mean Maurice Dean Witt as Quentin, the cop who with one or two little exceptions is in the same mode (ANGRY/PERPLEXED black dude) in the entire running time, and the actor Andrew Miller playing Kazan. Aside from that, the performances are quite amazing, and the characteristics of the actors make these characters fit into this warped situation all the better. And the script itself is terrific, its lines of dialog always important line-to-line be it something descriptive about one of the people or that sobering 'confession' from Holloway about designing part of the outside but still having no idea what this *is*.But at the end, you'll remember Cube the most for putting you in an unfamiliar world with the most familiar types you wouldn't (or would) want to be around in a situation like this. It's not simply about figuring out a puzzle or a game like some BS Saw-movie contraption. It's about morality and choices and the nature of construction of the mind and the soul. Deep stuff that entertains and attracts one in despite its closed-quarters and potential for being 'stagey'. an",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Production design isn't  a substitute for a script and characters an audience can care about.

A metaphor for life?,"I think everyone who saw this movie has questions.And I believe those questions are left unanswered, because ultimately, the quest for answers is what pushes us forward as a species.That's what makes ""The Cube"" quite brilliant for me.Googling for opinions, I found one that I thought seemed kind of apt: That the Cube represents life.The characters are ""born"" into the Cube (not literally). They all start at zero and just like in life have to make choices. And it's ultimately the character that asks no questions and is morally neutral that survives...I don't understand why many say the acting was bad. I admit, I knew none of the characters (maybe they were somewhat famous in Canada?), but I never felt that any of them are bad or doing a bad job. I think in general, few actors are truly amazing and actors benefit or suffer from a strong script (which ""The Cube"" has). To me, the acting was good.It's quite amazing how they used just one room to give us the illusion of dozens! The small budget doesn't show and I wonder how they did the quite impressive effects on a small budget. Even now, 25 years later they hold up well.I also enjoyed the very ominous soundtrack.

Nowhere As Clever As It Thinks It Is,"This got a lot of critical acclaim on its release . A very low budget Canadian thriller whose premise is a group of strangers wake up and find themselves trapped in a maze of rooms and right away the audience are asking themselves the important questions . Who are these people ? Why are they there ? What is this structure they're trapped in ? Who ? Why ? What ? and Where ? It's also good that the producers keep faith in the premise . All the on screen action takes place in the confined structure but this is probably down to budget limitations rather than creative decisions but that's not a criticism . What might be a problem is that is convincing the audience that this is possible in real life and not having the audience asking questions that will destroy the illusionI'm afraid that's where the film falls down to a large degree . Don't get me wrong I did enjoy this film for the most part but a few things did annoy me ? I take it the revelation that there's almost 18,000 rooms isn't true ? I mean having something like that would be impossible to keep secret , especially if the rooms themselves are able to move . Fair enough I was puzzled by two whys ? If you're going to trap people in what is effectively a giant puzzle box why fill it with people who have the ability to think ( Pun alert ) outside the box ? The other why is why would someone go to all the trouble to doing this in the first place ? In other words the scenario seems to exist merely to set up the premise for a movie with no logic beyond that . It's also a film that offers no explanations which makes for a frustrating ending that has little in the way of pay off",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
`It restores your faith in science fiction to see a movie as original and successful as this',"Ignore the title, I was being sarcastic.If this were the movie that restores faith in science fiction, I'd hate to have to watch the film that took the faith away. (It was probably The Matrix..)`Six strangers awaken from their daily lives to find themselves trapped in a surreal prison' No, no, no, this is all screwed up. I think what they meant was `Six terrible actors wake up in what looks like a set from a low budget 80's Sci Fi Star Trek wannabe filled with very unimaginative traps and a whole host of other crapness'The whole film takes place in `The cube', that fact gives the film a crappy low budget edge right from the offset. The first scene depicts a man in a room, getting sliced and diced by what looks like a big metal cargo net or something. Sound good? Forget it, I never thought I'd say this but, Resident Evil did the laser scene better. The movie then moves on to the main characters meeting each other, and within about ten minutes another one is on the floor, this time it was an acid thing that burnt his face off. At this point I thought the movie was looking up, I mean 2 deaths in ten minutes? Surely all the rest of them are going to die in shocking and exotic ways..A film such as this is a playground for great set piece death scenes, every room could hold a new secret, a new grizzly and gruesome death, what a wasted opportunity.Which brings me to the script, the word `rubbish' just doesn't do it justice, there are lots of words I could use, mediocre, silly, unbelievable, ridiculous etc but none of them are mean enough. Seriously, we need a new word to describe the script, when you've got characters saying, `look! It's the Renne', you know something is wrong.Now, the Japanese may like films where nothing is explained, but guess what? I don't. Where did the cube come from? Why were those people put in it? Where is it? How come this film sucks so much? So many questions.the characters throw a few theories around, such as `The government built it' `Aliens!' `It was an independent person', `the baddie from a James Bond film made it' (no, I didn't just make that one up) But what does that prove? Nothing.This film tries to be clever, with its underlying `morality' theme, apparently the cube is an extreme of life, being forced to interact with others that you don't necessarily want to interact with in a hostile environment, this is shown by the paranoia the characters fall into due to their situation, well actually one character feels the effects, and he just turns into a stupid lunatic that ends up wasting two potential death scenes. Morality and metaphorical issues? No thanks, lets have a good film instead.Which brings me to the ending, I can imagine the directors sat there now `come on, hurry up, my dinner's nearly ready, just throw anything together and lets get it shipped out!' The ending is a close contender for the worst of all time, up there with The fast and the furious. I mean anti climatic is an understatement, and the only likable character (the maths wiz) got killed and the worst character (the retard) survived! What were they thinking? Well, actually we don't even know if he did survive, as all he did was walk into a big white blur.In short, do yourself a favour and give it a miss. If they had a few more ideas than just spikes and acid, it could have been great. The idea is there, but it suffered from poor execution.

On the downside, though, the ending was absolutely horrible (left me wondering what the point of the whole thing had been) and watching Quentin, the police officer chew the scenery was downright painful.

I found this particular film to be highly entertaining, but not the timeless masterpiece that some people might think it is. Its a highly entertaining psychological thriller set in a maze. It provides a good afternoon experience.Also, this film suffers from dated special effects: computed generated images from 1997 look terrible compared to modern film, which severely detracts from the film's experience.

The strength of Cube lies in its inexorable grind towards an inevitable human conclusion.  I found myself immediately hooked, then intrigued, then finally engrossed by the claustrophobic and oppressive journey through the Cube, a journey both in time and space and in the stripping bare (figuratively and semi-literally) of the protagonists.Claustrophobics beware, this is a stifling film in every way.

I found myself watching particular parts over and over again trying to figure it out. Finally resorting to emailing the actors and even math advisor.Now the mathematics were mangled and lost somewhat in production, but the spirit and meaning was there.

pretentious pseudo-intellectual existentialism,"The worst thing about this movie was that I had a good idea of exactly where it was going after the first five minutes. OK, the premise is not terrible, but nor is it very original. You've got a bunch of people trapped in some kind of three-dimensional mazea - they don't know why they are there or whether they can get out.  Shades of the legendary ""Prisoner"" TV program, or ""No Exit"" by Sartre.  Typical existentialist themes: why are we here, what can we do, how do we solve our problems, is there any reason to have hope?The themes are reasonable, but the execution is terrible.  What one expects is a thematic pursuit about what people want to live for, some psychological exploration, etc.  What we get is inconsistent character development and insulting plot twists.My main problem with this movie is that the Worth and Quentin characters are very inconsistently drawn.  In the first half of the movie, the Quentin character provides leadership qualities, getting people motivated and moving, keeping up hope, while the Worth character is moody and generally acts like a coward and an ass. Suddenly, in the middle of the movie, each undergoes a magical transformation.  Worth is now the moral force behind the group, while Quentin becomes violent and rageful, ultimately reaching a state where he is a typical movie bad guy.  His psychosis appears suddenly without rhyme or reason.  Any hope I had for this movie went out the window when it appeared.  The movie was no longer even a half-decent treatment of existentialist themes, but rather had degenerated into ""watch out for the bad guy"" stuff.  Very disappointing.One minor quibble: the Leaven character is somehow easily able to tell if a three-digit number is prime or not, but then is paralyzed if she has to decide whether a number is a prime power.  As a professional mathematician, I have to say this plot twist is laughable.  Factoring three-digit numbers is a simple trick for a mathematician of Leaven's supposed caliber. The number of prime powers less than 1000 which are not themselves prime is really quite small.  One doesn't need a Rainman-type savant to solve this problem.  (Had they been factoring the full 9-digit numbers, well, that would have been much more impressive.)Ultimately, I was disappointed as the theme and the setting lent themselves to a very interesting movie.

The cast is composed of some of the strongest actors in the movie business, and each portrays both their original character and their later self in a spectacular manner.

"Great premise, bad acting, very suspenseful.","Cube has a great premise.  Six strangers wake up in some big cube-like structure, without knowing why they're there or how they got there.  And that is never explained in the movie.  Why? It's an existential metaphor for life.  Why are we here?  What's our purpose?  So don't whine that you wanted to know why they were in the cube.The acting in this film is bad, and the script could use a bit of work.  We see Leaven go from talking about going out with her friends to orgasming over prime numbers.  I think the best actor in the film is Andrew Miller who plays Kazan, the autistic savant whose constant finger tapping becomes part of the background music!Reading other reviews on this site, I noticed that everyone refers to Quentin as a policeman.  I can't believe that anyone who has seen the whole movie could think that.  I'm certain he's a convicted murderer who lied at the beginning to protect himself.  He knows who Rennes is, not because he was a cop, but because he was a criminal too.  And while everyone else had a purpose for being the group, Quentin was there only to add conflict and distrust.  When he jumped out the ""window"" to save Holloway from falling, he wanted to look good to the team, but then he realized that Holloway was the only one who actually stood up to him, and with her out of the way he could rough up the rest of the group.  That's why he let her go.This film has a great premise and an amazing set.  It is entirely suspenseful.

Not as good as it could have been,"A good premise and a plot thats starts out well but never quite gets off the ground.  Its a good movie, more interesting than many blockbusters and the plot is intriguing, different and poses questions.  Unfortunately those questions are neither answered nor engaging enough to make the viewer really care about it.In a way the plot is just too far removed from 'the real world' to reach the audience.   The incredible machinery of the cube demands more of an explanation than the vagaries alluded to by the characters.  No society could hide a construct like that, it simply cannot exist outside of any context.  In some shots the scale is shown and its bigger than a mountain!Although the mathematics are dodgy the idea of leaving clues for the 'prisoners' to decipher is good.   The characters are very stereotypical though, which is ok up to a point.  The movie loses its credibility with the addition of a token, straight off the shelf, 2 dimensial autistic boy who, of course, is able to supply the final mathematical solution.The ending is, unfortunately, entirely predictable after the first few interactions of the characters and when it comes its very dissatisfying. Overall though the movie is interesting enough to set it apart and above weaker mainstream sci fi contenders.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Interesting Concept,"What does it all mean?  After finding Cube on the New Release Shelf of the video store, I decided to hire it.  There were no famous actors in it and for this fact it appealed to me.  A group of people wake up with no knowledge of how they got into this square room.  From there, they try to figure out how to escape and try to piece together the whole reason behind being trapped in this cube.  The Audience is just as baffled and because of this, the audience is filled with the same sense of despair as it seems there is no way to get out.  This story leads to great discussion on the who, what and why.  Nothing can fully explain this story as it is one title one must see for themselves.  I recommend it to those who like a bit of cerebral exercise and won't pick out any shortcomings.  Best followed by another movie to stop you thinking about it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Cube,"The low budget sci fi horror movie Cube quickly became a cult classic.

Philosophy-friendly suspense yarn,"The movie has the taste not to overplay the potentially facile philosophical implications of its premise - a diverse group, in a stripped-down environment the origin of which they have no knowledge, finding that they each have a particular skill relevant to effecting their escape...if they can conquer their differences. Through generally unforced writing, canny acting, and surprisingly striking production design given the very low budget, the movie makes it as a suspense yarn. The limited possibilities of its premise start to become more obvious as it goes on, and it lacks the wild idiosyncrasy and fluency of something like Pi. But it's no surprise that it's reportedly been a big hit in France - it lends itself very effectively to a high-school essay-level of philosophizing; and it's no doubt canny (if dramatically a bit of a letdown) that the movie refrains from showing us what's outside the cube (except, as per one memorable exchange, human stupidity).",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent!!,Why movies like this don't get the acclaim they deserve is indicative of the stranglehold Hollywood has on modern movies and until we start to see other studios and directors with less money getting the credit they deserve movies like this will continue to be gems that only the die hard movie fans will discover.The movie is made on the cast performance and though there are a lot of special effects they are of the believable kind.This is what I call acting and though the scifi storyline may not be to everyones taste it'll have you on the edge of your seat.

Another Claustrophobic Delight,"I enjoyed Cube. I remember it was released and became very popular with the public. I didn't see it then, nor could I get into it when it was on TV. But I decided to watch it once, and it was a good effort. It had existential and different thoughts I wouldn't have expected. I enjoy movies that make you examine life and the things controlling it.Cube was about a group of people that are stuck in a cube. There are doors on all sides, and they must find the right way to enter the door. When they do, then they are in another cube. They keep going until they get somewhere or answer the puzzle of why they are there.I really enjoyed Cube. I would recommend seeing it. The existential part is my favorite.

An insult to the genre.  So bad you can't even laugh at it.,"People stuck in a prison-like trap who have to get out.  But everyone can't work together.  Hey, big surprise, we have a scientist / mathematician who can help solve the way out, and a ""mentally challenged"" individual that everyone has to say ""ooh"" and ""awww"" whenever he is on screen.  Let's throw in the ever-important guy who knows more about the situation than he's letting on, the doctor, and the semi-psychotic guy.What more can I say?  This movie was a lame, poorly acted, predictable, poorly-written rehash of an overdone story idea.  I think the episode of Star Trek:  TNG that I saw with a similar plot was better -- not exactly the greatest compliment.I predicted probably half of the plot details.  The other half was do absurd I couldn't possibly predict that the writers would insult my intelligence by writing it.  If you are the type of person who can sit back and watch a movie without thinking the writer, director, and all the actors are playing a secret little joke on you for having actually paid them for this heap of garbage, then maybe you will like it.For a while I thought the IMDB voters were fairly intelligent in what they like.  The fact that this movie gets anything more than a 2 by anyone is testiment to the fact that they are in fact confused.I did have a very slight liking for the array of cool traps in the various cube sections.

It combines cynicism about the social order with a clever use of mathematical concepts and violent outcomes direct from someone's worst nightmare.

For me, though, most intriguing is the idea that the Rubic's Cube in which the characters find themselves is neither the result of any centrally directed project nor of any conspiracy but instead the net result of a collection of myopic self-interested inputs - the pessimistic response to Adam Smith.

Brilliant idea. Almost brilliant execution but not quite....,"A perfect example of the fact that you don't need to have a big budget or big names to make a fantastic movie. My message to people who don't understand the plot of this movie or comment on the stupidity of people trapped in a cube or the fact that nothing is explained satisfactorily on how they got there or what the cube is there for, is this......none of that is the point or the driving force behind the story at all!This is a movie about how different people react when in a particular situation.....This time round it's a matter of survival... We get to see how different people with different personalities and driving forces react in a situation they all find themselves mysteriously stuck in. On this level this movie works brilliantly. Although for my money the performance of the idiot savant was overbearing and nearly always bordering on too much the rest of the cast were great. Sure some of the plot devices (such as them miraculously being able to decipher the meaning of the numbers in the cube) border on the ""Yeah right what utter crap"" side of movie cliches and suspension of reality, but if you can look past these small flaws and actually think (yes I realize that watching a movie and thinking are at odds with the mindset required for viewing the majority of big budget hollywood blockbusters) about the story and the way it is handled then this is a movie which WILL have much much more of an effect on the way you view many things than any ""100 minutes of light entertainment"" movie ever will.OverallGreat plot, good acting.

"Excellent, intelligent sci-fi","I guess if you're looking for STAR WARS full of action and lasers, then you should stay away from this one, because it's filled with tension throughout, with no intentional humor involved.  There's also some CGI in the film but it's kept to a minimum.  Most of it looks like it was done the old fashioned prosthetics way.  Yes !A group of people are placed are placed inside a large complex filled with thousands of movable cubes, that move around in a Rubik like fashion.  If you remember Rubik's Cubes from the late-70s, early 80s then you'll get the idea.The opening scene where a prisoner is sliced in a grid like fashion by a razor sharp, faster that a speeding bullet grid, is awesome!  You can actually see big chunks of body parts and organs falling and hitting the floor, with the slippery sounds of meat going 'thunk, thunk' in the background.  Slice it and dice it, baby.  Cool scene.Another excellent gore scene is when we see Rennes the escape artist get it in the face with a stream of squirting acid as he drops down into an adjoining cell.  The front half of his face starts to melt off with his front teeth exposed.  No CGI.  It's one of the best prosthetics effects I've ever seen in a film !!They all work together in order to break the code in order to get out of there.  That is, until Quentin the cop loses it and starts killing off some his fellow prisoners, like Dr, Holloway for one...  You see, the authorities (who we never see) put them all in there for a purpose.  To see if they can get out by placing not only the cube's mechanical obstacles in the way, but their own personalities and backgrounds as well.The whole set has a cool techno-industrial look to it, with lots of colored ambience and plot cues that are intelligently written.

The beginning of the movie was excellent.  The rooms of the maze were intriguing and created an eerie ambience early in the film.  The fact the characters didn't know how or why they got there was a perfect setup for a psychological thriller.After this encouraging beginning ""The Cube"" quickly plummets into the realm of trite and predictable.  The acting was terrible, the characters were unsympathetic, even the autistic guy.  I found myself wondering why I was even sitting there when I could be perusing the latest issue of ""Better Homes and Gardens.""But I sat through to the predictable ending, hoping that the film would redeem itself. What could have been a film that kept you wondering for weeks and getting your friends to watch so you could conjecture with them about it turned out to be one of the worst 90 minutes I've wasted in a while.

An Unexpected Gem.,"I've heard for some time how great this movie was, and have meant for some time to watch it. But after I watched Cube Zero the other night, I decided that I HAD to see it, and that the time was now. I expected a decent movie: something atmospheric and intelligent, but largely nothing I hadn't seen before. What I got, instead, was an unexpected cinematic gem, far better than most other movies.The acting was great, not excellent by any means, but still of a very high caliber. The two most memorable deserve special mentioning.Nicole de Boer (Jone Leaven: The Math Student) did an outstanding job. She had a solid and believable performance throughout the entire film. She was very steady, and even made actions as mundane as her thinking for extended periods of time enjoyable.Maurice Dean Wint (Quentin: The Cop) gave a thoroughly enjoyable performance as a man who sinks deeper and deeper into depraved madness. in most cases, actors given this kind of role will make their characters descend into madness far too quickly. While he might have overacted a little from time to time, he gave a extremely well-paced performance and believably portrayed his characters increasing insanity.Personally, I found these actors/actresses all far above average and more than competent in their roles. I'm actually surprised that they haven't gone on to at least be recognizable mid-name actors. A special mention should be given to whoever did the casting. They did an absolutely perfect job at choosing the roles.The direction was simple, yet effective. It used a style that reminded me very much of Alfred Hitchcock: minimalist, but maximizing every aspect of the film. Vincenzo Natali created a powerful and thick environment; tense and atmospheric. Even moreso than the crew, I would have expected him to have become a much greater success than he is now.Natali also wrote the script which, like his direction, is simple and effective. 7 people wake up in a labyrinth of trapped cubes and must find their way out. The cast is small, the premise simple, and the dangers evident. And yet these are all its greatest strengths. With a small cast, every danger, every death, means much more than if there was a larger cast. Also, with a smaller cast there's much more time to develop each character, which the script maximizes upon. The simplicity of the script, the almost bare danger, makes it all the more terrifying. You know the rules, you know what's going to happen, and you know that there's no way to avoid it.The emptiness of the cube, the isolation from anything and everything else, is felt in every passing minute. The utter pointlessness of it all is as thoroughly maddening to the audience as it is to the characters. This, however, gives every action more meaning, and adds to the film's overall tone. The dark colors of the various rooms add to heavy and dismal atmosphere. The emptiness beyond the cube creates a further sense of isolation. And the powerful message at the end of the film (which I won't spoil for anybody), the bitter-sweet irony of it all, is what makes this such an excellent film.Overall, this is a classic sci-fi thriller. It's a definite must-see for science fiction and horror fans, as well as fans of powerful human drama. This is easily one of the most original and successful films I can think of in any of those three categories.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This is science fiction in the ""here's an idea, how might this idea play out?"" sense.If you enjoy starting inside the action and trying to figure movies out, then hoo boy, you are in for a treat. There are few movies that scratch that particular nightmare/sci-fi/thriller/mystery itch the way Cube does.Reactions can be mixed. The movie makes a couple of poignant statements about human nature. It also doesn't explicitly answer all the questions presented. If viewers like or don't like these decisions, it seems to make or break the movie for them. Speaking for myself, I found Cube's mystery-to-payoff ratio extremely satisfying. I'm glad the filmmakers left a few things up to the viewer to chew-on, well after the movie is over.I truly wish there were more sci-fi films like this. If you know of any that you'd recommend, please comment or send them along.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Novelty idea that goes nowhere carried by good acting,"It's a slow movie that asks a lot of initial questions. Most of these questions get repeated throughout the film, sometimes even countered by new information, suddenly this character spouts something that sounds like it's going to reveal further knowledge about the plot and meaning behind what they're trapped in, but it practically never gets brought up again in a meaningful way.You spend a majority of the movie watching people waste time. The first interesting character the movie lets us get to know, backstory and everything, is almost immediately removed from the equation just after. It's just a long and drawn out series of people asking eachother questions, asking themselves questions, and then they jump through a hole in the wall.It was a fun watch, mostly because the characters are all really distinct from eachother- none of them feel like an outright stereotype or trope, and the characters that did get developed did so in a surprising way that actually caught me off guard. While I wish I could rate this movie higher, my heart tells me it's a 6. About two hours of what amounts to useless meandering culminates in... nothing, really.If the initial prospect of 'trapped in a cube maze' sounded cool, don't worry, it is!- for like, 30 minutes before the hype drops off. Nothing gets expanded upon. There's no real clues that the audience can figure out on their own, so they don't feel like they're on for the adventure, and the actual concept of cubes, mazes, and booby traps, isn't as explored as much as I wish there was.There were some amazing practical effects at some points in the film, but it never happens that often, and they blow most of the budget in the first 30 minutes.Despite my criticisms, it's still worth watching. All the actors bring a great performance, even the ones that don't stick around as long as the others, and I enjoyed watching the group squabble amongst themselves. If you really want to watch this movie, you'd do it for the characters, so you can see how they interact with the situation and eachother when under extreme stress- the movie plays around with ideas of nihilism and humanitarianism a lot, and while I don't think it delivers some amazing psychological message, it's a good watch for that alone.It's not something fun enough to watch with other people, it's not something interesting enough for me to watch again, but I don't regret seeing it, so it's a strong 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Smart, frightening, unique","This is a pretty special film. You get thrown right in without any underlying story, where a couple of individuals are trapped in a cubic maze. Nobody knows what it is, why they are there or how they got there. As a viewer of the film you do not know anything more than the characters do, as they progress through the deadly traps and hopefully earn some understanding of the mystery. Somehow these individuals were not chosen by random to enter the maze, in some way they each carry one piece of the puzzle, all they have to find out is just what these pieces are and how to use them.I thought this film created a pretty real sense of fear all the way through. It gives your mind a little spin. That said it is far from perfect. I believe the idea is very interesting, but it could have been even better executed with better actors and a bigger budget. The character chemistry does not live up to the smart qualities of the original idea of the film, and occasional events are cliche'. I however really recommend you to rent and see this film, do not buy it unseen as I suspect the replay value is pretty close to nothing.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Could have been great,"This is a movie that, in the hands of a more disciplined writer, could have been a sci-fi classic.  The premise -- six strangers awake to find themselves in a seemingly infinite series of interconnected room, many of which are lethally booby-trapped -- is intriguing.  And early on, as the group explores the rooms and begins to ask the obvious questions about their situation, the movie seems very promising.Unfortunately, that promise is never fulfilled.  Instead of exploring those questions -- where are we?  why were we chosen? who built the Cube? -- the writer takes the easy way out, as the second half of the movie degenerates into nihilistic pointlessness.  The mysteries that were developed in the first half are casually dismissed as the characters become steadily nastier and the plot becomes steadily sillier.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Effective and compelling, despite a flawed script","A strange, satisfying but far from flawless low-budget science-fiction horror drama. A group of strangers wake up to find themselves in a huge cube consisting of equal-sized rooms, some of which contain fatal traps. They don't know each other, why they're there, where they are or how to get out. As the film passes, the group are inevitably picked off and we learn more of who they are. There's much to be commended, especially in an era of cinema replete with prequels, cinematic universes, backstory and origin stories where everything that can be explained is explained. Though this film has a (kind of) tidy ending, there's much we don't know; a lot is left to our imagination, for us to fill in the blanks - or to leave them blank if we want to. Is the film about conspiracy theories; a Lord of the Flies style experiment in human savagery; an exercise in sadistic ways of dying? Other things? All of them? None of them? That's the appeal and potential frustration of the film. Despite a script that is at times badly flawed and some very limited performances, this is a film that works because of what it doesn't tell us, making the best of a clearly limited budget. Sometimes less really is more.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Another example is the 1999 film Deterrence (http://us.imdb.com/Title?0158583).I like the idea of this movie, but it feels like it was written and directed by a high school drama class.  The acting is also straight out of high school.  Each of the characters has inexplicable obsessions.  Ideally, we'd know more about the history of the characters to make their reactions less strange.

"Great idea, could have been better","What really didn't work for me about CUBE is that in ultra-stressful, life-or-death situations, people tend to put their differences aside and work together. Instead, we get several opposite personalities reminiscent of reality TV who are thrust together like different bugs in a jar. Ultimately, that's a cheap way to generate disagreement and I wasn't sold on the tension it was trying to build. I would have much rather they agreed and worked together, and that their disagreements were left to situations where multiple approaches were plausible but both sides were adamant and refused to back down. That would have forced the audience to take a side depending on their own problem-solving and personality styles.What I did like about Cube is its character-driven style and simple premise that it explores with considerable detail.

Interesting Premise - But Leaden Dialogue Weights It Down,"If you're going to a movie like this one, kind of a sci-fi/horror version of Waiting for Godot, then the characters and the dialogue are crucial. This is where this film falls down. The characters are essentially one dimensional, and while some show growth and development over the course of the film, most remain undeveloped. The dialogue is at times leaden, with endless and heated discourses on the ""military-industrial complex"" and other such ""political"" issues. Like other reviewers, I can see why it was a hit in France. I kept expecting a character to announce something like ""OK, lets escape from here and all go to Starbucks to discuss the philosophical implications on the destruction of individualism and it's impact on society"". This is the sort of leaden discussions one continues to read in European intellectual circles, and seems particularly popular amongst some of the intelligentsia in France. Alas, class issues and the nefarious doings of the military industrial complex have little resonance in 1999 USA.In the story itself the characters actions often seem illogical and forced at times. I know that they're supposed to be under stress, but they also seem pretty slow to catch on for a group of hyper bright people. The portrayal of the autistic savant came perilously close to being insulting, saved only by the actors skill. The other actors (mainly no-names) also give it a good shot, particularily give the material they had to work with. The ending seemed contrived, and some plot resolution in terms of the why and how would have improved the film.The best role I see for this film is as a discussion piece for undergraduate Poli Sci and Philosophy classes. Professors and TA's take note.5 out of 10, mainly for acting and the innovative use of cheap sets.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

While no one can figure out how they got there, they have deduced that the cube has infinite rooms filled with death traps. As the rooms kill, the math whiz tries to figure out the secret.Psychologically scary but also imbued with a decent amount of gore, this dreamlike cult Canadian gem from 1997 offers very little exposition, leaving the viewer in the dark as much as the characters.FYI: homeless people are the worst locked room contestants because they aren't motivated to escape.

Sci-Fi at its best,"OK lets admit that 97% of all sci-fi movies are terrible works of cinema, but the 3% really makes searching through the extensive sci-fi works at the movie store well worth it.Cube is most definitely low budget, but it is one hell of a movie. The premise is excellent, I love the idea of people struggling through mazes- it reminds me of life, and the coordination of the scenes are impressive.The acting is not real bad, which is good for a low budget film, and I think Nicole is so hot(even with the spots-DS9.) The ending was unique, and I didn't see it coming. They really have me by the b-lls on this one. They don't seem to give you any relevant information to the world outside the cube, so you will have to continue the series.

A group of strangers have to work their way out of some kind of 3D moving maze, and they discover they each have talents which are critical to escaping.However, while the math girl is given some kind of 'genius' aura, it's a well known joke between people even vaguely versed in maths that the writers of the show don't have a GCSE or high school diploma (depending which country you're in) related to maths to rub between them.Maths lesson 101, if a number ends in 2,4,6, 8 or 0, it's a multiple of 2. If it ends in 5 or 0, it's a multiple of 5. There are other tricks too (sum of digits being a multiple of 3 means the number itself is a multiple of 3, via modular arithmetic) but the glaring errors in the maths whiz's skills makes it no longer a tense horror film, but a comical farce.Should you be less of a pedant than myself and friends then it's a very good watch.

How would I cope with it? Could I make it out? All of these questions were going through my mind as I watched this excellent flick.The mood is very grim and uneasy. The colors of the rooms and the eerie noises of those doors opening and closing make it even more unsettling. Other than the characters talking, the only other noise is the slight humming of the rooms themselves. Watching it in complete darkness on a home theater system completely immersed me in the film.The gore is fantastic, especially the scene in the beginning. It's nice to see a recent movie with the guts to show some blood and guts! (no pun intended...well, maybe a little) Even though there are only two good gore scenes, they are two really good scenes. The special effects are decent for 1997, nothing groundbreaking. And none of the gore is computer generated, which makes it even better.The acting is good by everyone. The one who really stood out was Rennes, the convict. I really liked him. His ""take no crap"" attitude was perfect and is exactly the mentality you'd need to get through this.

Nothing short of brilliant. One of the greatest cult movies ever made.,"It's really inspiring how you can make such a awe-inspiring movie with a marvelously low budget.This movie centers between a group of people: Worth, Leaven, Quentin, Holloway, Kazan, Alderson and Rennes. Or, well, they are all the people winding up in the cube at least. Two of them die pretty quickly.Having one of the most memorable and creepiest opening scene to a movie I've ever seen, the movie starts off doomsday-like already at the start. While this movie does have a mystery, it's not the main thing making this movie so fantastic. The visuals, the characters, the sharp and funny dialogue, the atmosphere... these are all the factors for a classic piece of horror. The color palettes and the cinematography is a joy to the movies. I could watch this movie plenty of times if just to look at imagery so beautiful I am irritatedly jealous. The music for this movie is good too. Out of all the characters, Holloway is my least favorite since Nicky Guadagni's acting is pretty inconsistent. But other than that, the acting is shockingly good for a B grade horror movie. Andrew Miller gives a great impression of a delirious, but still smart, autistic individual, David Hewlett is great as the anti-hero Worth, Nicole De Boer does a solid job as Leaven... and best of all is Maurice Dean Wint as Quentin. Not only is his character the most fascinating in the whole movie, but his acting is so versatile and believable it's sad how he never had a chance to win an Oscar. While this movie is not outright terrifying, the movie really builds up the suspense well. And while they are not many, some moments are quite startling. And how can I praise this movie without naming some of the hilarious lines? For not being a horror comedy, it sure is funny. The balance between pure horror and comedic horror is a fine line, but the comedy was never overdone, so it was a movie making me laugh while still managing to take it seriously.The best lines:""The only reason you even exist is because I keep you! I know your type. No kids, no man to fuc'k you. So you go around outraged, sticking your nose up people's assholes.

"It Promised so much , but alas....","Cube could have been so much better , the potential for a great movie was there, the Idea was superb. 6 people stuck in a cube , each side had a door which lead to another cube , the problem being some cubes were booby trapped to kill. The film started really well and the special affects at the beginning was outstanding , but why didn't they film carry on in the same vein? The most interesting person of the 6 got killed before anybody else leaving the others ,all of who were really irritating , to argue with each other.I didn't care who kicked the bucket out of the five , in fact i was kind of hoping they would all walk into a room and get cheese wired!

"cheaply made, thrilling, gory, upsetting","This is seriously one of the freakiest and weirdest movies I've seen.It gives a sense of human paranoia, human evils, and also a sense of Darwinism.  Who will survive out of: one lady doctor, one black cop, one escape artist, one chick math nerd, one mentally ill, and one guilty salary man?Even though this movie is cheaply made, considering they probably only had to make one big room with six sliding doors (and the colored walls change color to show that they are actually moving from cube to cube), parts of the computer graphics are great... and gory.Without any music, tension builds up quite quickly.  The only sounds we hear are those of the people talking, the sliding doors, and the electronic booby traps.Despite the thrill, the tension, and the heart pumping faster, the movie itself is satirical and quite upsetting.  By the end, I asked myself if humans are actually that evil, and if our society is THAT corrupt.  And also, if one watches movies for visual effects, as I do, only the first half of the movie will appeal, since most of the movie is quite repetitive.  I mean, seriously, the best of visual directors could not make an aesthetically appealing movie from people moving simply from box to box!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Awful,"Interesting premise, but fails in three dimensions (sorry, I couldn't help myself) - as a horror mystery, because plot holes abound and the math stuff is inane, as a character study, because they're ridiculous and poorly acted, and as philosophy, because it bungles its attempts to relate their plight to the human condition. I laughed out loud at how bad this was several times. It's creative and had singular focus, but the execution was awful.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It makes you think!,"Hi, there were a lot of words about the film; scenes, characters, dialogues etc. Regarding the Cube I do not think it is the film itself that one should appraise but the thoughts one have afterwards. Might be a pointless prison with six stangers to cooperate for escape? Might be a cube whit small cubes inside that keep moving having six unknown actor in it? Might have more subtle meaning like life and living and eternal questions about the creator? A wonderful film that makes you think, really not too many of this type in the movies nowadays!I personally think this is a kind of film only a certain age can create: when you are just over the resolute searching of the ANSWERS, when you are not YOUNG any more.

Impressive Low Budget Thriller,"Although there are some continuity conflicts and at times over the top acting (although maybe intentionally), this film is an extraordinary accomplishment given what the filmmakers had to work with. The end is also a bit dicey, but then again it leaves much open to discussion which in this case is a good thing. I have talked to a friend who is very involved with the math field, and he is the only person I know who straight up didn't like the film. The point being, if you are capable enough with math to understand geometry, basic algebra, etc., you will be fine - but if you are familiar with stuff like the chaos theory and abstract mathematics you'll be offended. If anyone else with extensive knowledge of mathematics has seen this film I'd be very interested on hearing feedback. All that aside, this film is truly captivating. I was introduced to it by spotting it in a friend of a friend's collection, asked him about it, and he replied ""I can't explain it, I'll just show you the first scene."" After watching the first scene of this film, YOU CANNOT STOP. There is no way. One of the most innovative, thought provoking films I've ever seen.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Original,"While not perfect, this is an amazing film. This is what you get when people with enthusiasm and a new concept get the opportunity to put something together. With few exceptions, this abandons all clichés. The ambiguity is astonishing, and this could be viewed as a metaphor for any number of things. This uses the audience's imagination in a way too seldom seen since the likes of Hitchcock. While the acting(apart from some shining moments and the performance of Hewlett) is not all great(and when you take into consideration how little they had to work with, they're not bad), the characters are incredibly well-written, credible and varied. The horror is almost purely psychological, and the personalities and humanity is also the source of the drama. Dialog has occasional blunders of lines, but beyond that, it's natural, with depth and even philosophy that is delivered without being preachy or pretentious. The mood and atmosphere, gritty, dark, paranoid and claustrophobic, has been imitated, not matched, since the release of this. There is an underlying tension throughout this, and it is immensely exciting. It breaks up the suspense with light-hearted bits here and there, and this walks that balance beautifully. FX are sufficiently well-done, and they are used as a tool, never taking over. The editing and cinematography are nicely done, at times experimental, and at no point flashy. This is about subtlety and, save for the traps, simplicity, and yet it is rather creative and different. The sound design is well-done, and the music is minimalistic, both as far composition and use. This is not for everyone. It is not straightforward, Hollywood or mainstream. The ending, or a portion of it, is potentially a letdown to an extent. With a running time of about 90 minutes, this is not so long that the setting grates on your nerves. There is infrequent strong language, a tad of sexual material, a lot of disturbing content and a limited amount of blood, violence and gore in this. The DVD comes with an interesting and fun commentary track by the director, one of the writers and one actor, David, three really short deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer and photo galleries with storyboards and production art. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys good, scary, mysterious science fiction. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

We turn the Cube and it twists us.,"Cube: Cube is a story of six or so people who wake up in a... well... cube. On each side of the cube (including above and below), there are doors that lead to other cubes. Some of the cubes have deadly traps. There are three etched three-digit numbers on each cube that may provide a clue whether a particular cube is deadly and may also provide a clue on how to escape. Can the figure a way out without getting killed before they succumb to starvation or thirst or are simply driven mad?The Good: I have a lot of pet peeves in movies. One of the biggest is films that explain everything to the audience as if we were dimwitted fourth graders. The Cube explains nothing. I love this. We can decide which of the characters speculations are correct or even if any of them are. This creates a wonderfully engaging film.The film is well written with some excellent character arcs. Some of the characters are a little on the trope side of the equation (I am looking your way Rain Man) but overall it is an engaging group. There is a nice argument between just moving forward one cube at a time and the idea of trying to figure out what it all means. The movie really doesn't take sides once again allowing the viewer to decide which approach is best.The special effects are actually quite good when they make an appearance and the set keeps one's interest for the relatively brief running time.The Bad: The movie plays its room trap cards pretty early in a truly spectacular way. One wishes they had revisited that a bit more throughout the film. The film also suffers a little from the we ran out of cannon fodder too soon syndrome.It really isn't that hard to figure out is a three digit number is prime. If it is an even number or ends in a five it isn't prime as an example. Our so-called math expert in the group took way to long to figure some of these out.In Conclusion: This is a great example of how to make a low budget film with only seven actors, one set, and an engaging interesting script. The last part is a nut plenty of big-budget movies have yet to crack. Like the early Saw films, Cube is greater than the sum of its parts and a wonderful example of minimalism in a film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Claustrophobia & Maths... nightmare.,"Struck real fear into my heart... There is nothing quite like edgy survival to bring out the basest beast in all of us, as this film shows. There also seemed to be a certain significance in that only the autistic character, whom everyone thought of as lack witted, was the only who provided the clue to the factors (and therefore the way out) in the end. How about the way the sunlight shone on Leaven and Worth's faces when they found the exit? Almost like an awakening or rebirth; yet both of them dies in the end anyways... The most final part of the film was (almost) symbolized by the smearing of the cop's blood as the bridge shifted. Brilliantly done, all in all!",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Has ups and downs. No masterpiece, but no turkey either.","This has good points and bad points. One good point that it tries to break out of the Hollywood mould, and to sime extend succeeds. One bad point is that all the characters are polar, they all have one role in the film, and they tediously follow their assigned pattern, having no complexity or depth. (Why am I reminded of The Breakfast Club as I write this? That film was better in this regard). There were a few weaknesses in the plot too - suddenly one person lost the ability to do what had previously been trivial, and for no reason al all except to bring another cookie-cutter character into play. I sound negative, but I did enjoy the film, and if you don't mind the occasional gruesome scene, it's worth a look. I hear that it was done on a low budget, in which case kudos to the crew and actors.FatPhil.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
You'll love this one!!!!,"This is a big, awesome, great movie. It's original and disturbing. It gives you a perspective of how relations evolve in a closed space like for example...a cube. The concept of this movie is also very original. 6 people were put in a gigantic cube with lots of rooms, some of those booby trapped, and they have to escape. They don's know how they got there, they don't know why they got there, basically the only thing they know it's that they need to get out of there because they have no food nor water and in a few days will die. A great movie about relationships without the feeling of ""deja-vu"". Sometimes you need to see a film that is simple in all its aspects.

My opinion wasn't changed much about the action of the film but I did develop a respect for the technical side.I take it that this movie was supposed to make you think and have deep philosophical value.  It just kind of reminds me of the conversations you had in college after a long night and a few beers when you and your buddies were just one brew short of the meaning of life.

Amazing original concept,"Cube is a low budget Canadian psychological horror film about a group of strangers who wake up in a mysterious cube shaped room with no recollection of how they got there. On each wall, ceiling and floor there are doors leading to identical adjacent rooms. They soon find out that some rooms have deadly traps in them and as a result they are killed off one by one as they make their way through the cube searching for a way out until there are only a few left.The plot is fairly straightforward and there are no major twists. While the concept of strangers waking up in a horrible place is not exactly original in the horror genre, the setting is well thought out and the viewer is kept longing for answers about the nature of the cube and who is responsible for it. The dialogue is a bit cheesy at times, but it is delivered well by the actors. The characters are a little on the two dimensional side and could have used a bit more exploring.The acting in cube is convincing. Stars David Hewlett and Nicole De Boer went on to make quite a name for themselves in the science fiction genre, but it is interesting to see them in an early low budget film.The direction in cube is superb. The tension is held throughout as the characters slowly go insane. Clever use is made of the limited production value. The whole film is shot on one set, the cube room. Each room is the same set, only lit differently and through clever use of cinematography and editing the characters' journey from room to room is believable.Overall cube is a very good film. Again a film where a strong script and good direction compensates for lack of extensive sets and flashy special effects. Cube is one of those films where, when it's finished, you find yourself asking for more. I definitely recommend checking this one out.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Whatever your station in life, your time is way too valuable for this movie ...","... you will never be able to get those ninety minutes back. Run.  Walk. Play in a park.  Do laundry.  Hug somebody.  Write a letter.  Clean out that messy drawer.  Do the crossword.  Surf the internet.  Just don't watch this movie.  I'm serious.Now, before the hordes of angry adolescents with Jessica Alba posters start coming after me (with the larger, more thoughtful general sci-fi set not far behind), let me say ... the IDEA of this movie is interesting.Essentially a takeoff on the disaster/Poseidon Adventure setup, where a bunch of diverse people who wouldn't normally hang out together are forced to get along in order to solve a big problem -- e.g., their survival -- I thought it wouldn't be half bad.  And it's not, initially.  But as this thing plods on, with some really poor acting performances, it really vacillates between two poles: ""Oh, yeah, we've been dropped in a cube ... a giant series of cubes, actually, and we're probably going to die ... hey, how do we open that door?  Hmm, that's a nice shirt/pant combo he has ..."" and ""OMIGODOMIGODOMIGOD we're going to die! Die! DIEDIEDIE!!!!""I've never been trapped in a cube, so this may be normal behavior.  But it's a little tired from an acting standpoint.So ... acting fair to middlin', at best.  But what really gets me is you watch this whole stupid affair, only to find out ... nothing.  Zip, nada, nothing.  It just ends.Now perhaps I'm accustomed to films and not self-indulgent class projects. But a little more than ""hey, the savant'll save 'em"" might be nice.  I'm not asking for the whole backstory -- I watch X-Files, etc., and understand the fun of keeping stuff from the audience.  But this is the sci-fi equivalent of one of those French films, where she might date him, and might not, and we don't know, and there's a lot of talking, and ... hey, it just ended.

Has both highs and lows,"First of all, if you have any mathematical skills, leave them outside the cinema. Everything that has to do with mathematics  in this movie is that inconsistent and illogical it offends your brain, so you should forget about it if you want to enjoy Cube. Second, the plot logic in general is very doubtful.The idea and visualization is great. The actors don't work Oscar-like, but they do a good job. Some comments on this site lament about the stereotype characters, but imagine you had a movie with six nearly similar characters, wouldn't that be boring? Apart from that, they are no stereotypes as some persons turn out to be completely different in the end; cliches don't undergo changes like this.Some scenes are extraordinarily thrilling. I have read ""The Process"" by Kafka and while watching Cube, I realized many parallels. So, if you like weird ideas like this, don't bother too much about logic and don't let some ugly scenes repel you, Cube might be a great enjoyment for you.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"A different horror movie, but still has horror movie flaws","Cube is an odd animal. It feels different from other horror movies that came before it. Oh sure, the idea of putting people into a situation where they start getting killed one by one as they try to find a way to save themselves from a mysterious danger is not new, and there are other horror movie clichés here too, but there is a difference in presentation that separates this movie from other horror films.The set looks cool and minimalistic; there are elements of psychological thriller in the interactions of the characters and their background; there are no guns and no monster; and the camera work and the pacing are different from your average flick.The film's about a group of people stuck inside a deadly puzzle. The group progresses through the puzzle, while navigating the relationship with one another and dealing with their own issues.Cube can come off as both dumb and smart. The dialogue, on one hand, takes a dip in quality. It is not very original and just does not flow naturally. It is horror movie writing, which is to say: bad.Visual presentation, on the other hand, is the Cube's most distinguishing feature. The whole thing takes place inside a cuboid puzzle, which looks like the interior of an alien spaceship. This must have been money saving, because all you really need is one or two sets and a few colourful lamps to light the plastic a different colour, but it also looks very effective and unique. The characters are all wearing grey prison outfits. The set, the outfits and the use of white lights create a sterile look like in some alien hospital. The camera rotates from one Dutch angle to the other, creating a sense of unease. These angles, the close-up shots of people's faces and the bulging eyes of the actor Maurice Dean Wint all contribute to the claustrophobic crazy alien look that this film has.The film does use some CGI, which looks terrible, but may have been impressive when this movie first came out.I want to give this film a higher praise but some of the acting and the writing was irritating. It is however one of the better horror movies out there and definitely one of the more original looking ones.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
you're trapped,"Vincenzo Natali's ""Cube"" has to be one of the most intriguing movies ever.

Each has his/her own theory about the cube (a supervillain's brainchild, the military-industrial complex) but they realize that they have to find a way out...but which way is out?The claustrophobic setting combined with the cube's Kafkaesque nature makes this one disturbing movie. The cast members were people whom I didn't recognize, so that made it seem as though this could be happening to literally anyone. I will say that some of the dialog was hackneyed, but the plot made up for that, especially the twists that they threw in.I recommend the movie.

Mysterious but intriguing thriller,"""Cube"" is an odd little movie which you could describe as a ""high concept"" film. In other words, it was probably made on the strength of a pitch which went something like this: ""Seven people awaken and find themselves inexplicably trapped inside of a giant cube. They have to navigate there way to the outside, but find many compartments to be death traps. Who will make it out, alive, from THE CUBE?!"". Sound interesting? Perhaps you could view this thriller as an inverse scenario to the classic horror movie ""Hellraiser"" which I've also reviewed at this site.Anyway, this movie fortunately gives a wide berth to any humbug about the nature of the cube these seven people find themselves in. If it had gone down that direction, I'm sure it would have been laughable, but you can imagine your own scenariossomething of a scenario like in the ""Saw"" franchise of splatter movies? Another possibility is hinted at when the film ends, which I won't go into, to let you come to your own conclusions. All very mysterious, which is as it should be for this kind of stuff.Since I've given this film a score of around 6/10 (and I'm going on memory to rate this film), why should you see it? Well, it has the most aesthetically pleasing scene of human butchery I've ever seen. Hmmmsounds badwell, it's not really that bad. Right at the start of the movie, there is a scene which is sort of realistic and sort of cartoony, which provides the ""Wow!!"" factor. And if Windows' ""Vista"" made you say ""Wow!"", you really should get out more! So, 6/10 for a wondrous death scene that will have you reaching for the ""freeze frame"", ""frame by frame"" or ""slow motion"" buttons on your remote! Intriguing movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It's a film where you need to leave all sense of logic and judgement, and just have fun!Sit down on a Saturday night with some friends and enjoy it.

A Case of Rave Reviews Heightening Ones Expectations.,"Cult classic. Awesome. Brilliant. Riveting. Clever. These words all made ""Cube"" sound like it was going to bust open the roof with its fresh approach to tension and science fiction. It did not. The film proved incredibly boring and only showcased how dated it is. Perhaps watching it closer to the original release date might have influenced ones opinion on how unique this story is. But time would not be on ""Cubes"" side and this low budget indie wonder would not really cross over into the Cult realm as I don't think it will garner new fans. And a cult classic needs longevity or else its more of a generational film.I'd recommend other films in its place but coming on to 20 years from the films initial release there's too many films that are more awesome, brilliant, riveting and cleverer than this slow drab of a film.Watch it if you're curious but please don't think you've missed out on something if you haven't seen it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I'm not dying in a f*cking rat maze!,"How did I get here? Why am I here? How do I get out? Can I do it myself, or do I need someone to help me?

These are some of the same questions being asked by a group in a fantastic cube, where a mistake in a decision can cost you your life.Worth (David Hewlett) had it down. We are so concerned with our pathetic little lives that we fail to see the big picture. That allows others to manipulate and control us. It's not a conspiracy; it's just that we have ceased to care. Nature abhors a vacuum, so someone will take control while we look the other way.Kazan (Andrew Miller) is autistic, and shows how we tend to dismiss the less fortunate when it suits us.The cop Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint) and the social worker Halloway (Nicky Guadagni) showed the opposite sides of the debate over what our society values - people or order.Those are just my observations, and I am sure others will make their own interpretations.

"A satisfying alternative to more ""mainstream"" fare.","Cube is original, uses no gimmicks or trickery, and doesn't dumb down anything to please the audience. It is by no means the best film going around or probably even in the top 20 films of 1997, but I thought it was worth a look then and I still do now.I view Cube as similar to Pi and Primer, two low budget flicks that took a risk and made strangely compelling and interesting films. They might not stack up to your Die Hards, T2s or Alienssss, but they give a bit of much needed variety.A guy wakes up in a large empty room with metal walls, floor and ceiling, he opens a door which leads into an exact copy of the previous room, walks into the room and is immediately and without warning sliced and diced, Resident Evil style by a booby trap that he triggered.Ladies and gentlemen, meet Cube.In other rooms more people wake up, each in their own room, it appears that all rooms are interlocking and one by one they meet. No-one knows why they are in the rooms, how they got there or what happens next, but they know this isn't the office Christmas party.Initially there are 5 ""inmates"", three guys and two women, as they interact and query their predicament it becomes evident that there is no easy similarity between them all or reason for them being there, there is a doctor, a cop, maths student, an ""escape artist"" and a person who describes himself simply as an office worker.They ponder and plan how they might escape from the situation that they are in, theories and plans are hatched and most immediately shelved, but after moving carefully through a couple more rooms using a bait approach to show any booby traps their number is suddenly and graphically reduced to 4. More clues are discovered, more theories are introduced, and they come across another inhabitant in the maze.The new chum is best described as a more highly strung rain man type, capable of certain logical thought but largely useless for the group's short term goals, and in fact a hindrance in many situations.As the group don't know each other a certain level of snippiness and resentment is inevitable, though it does feel a little forced on occasion, even when their circumstances are considered. They continue musing why them? why there? and who did this? but no simple answer is provided.When a breakthrough is had, the group dynamic changes somewhat, as allegiances are formed and dissolved and paranoia rules, ultimately leading to betrayal, treachery and violence, as any good story should.Without going into who dies first, why they are there and if any manage to escape, I must give credit for the filmmakers efforts to at least try to make things interesting. This is obviously a low budget production but they manage to squeeze as much as they can from the limited sets and what is likely a minimal special effects budget. This is a reasonably smart, if sometimes baffling exercise in building tension and creating uncertainty and unease, and for the large part it succeeds.There are no explosions, no snappy one liners or gratuitous hotties, and only a few scenes of violence or gore, and so when they arrive they actually have a bit more impact as we are a little less desensitised.Final Rating 6.5 – 10. I can't unequivocally recommend Cube for everyone, but if you don't mind the odd experimental art-house-y flick, this is more interesting than 20 Transformers movies, despite an absence of Megan Fox's tanktop.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A Good Study Of Group Dynamics, But It Lacks Any Real Resolution","This movie is really more about group dynamics than science fiction, and it offers a pretty good portrayal of the dynamics of one particular group of people who find themselves caught up in an insane situation and have to learn to work together if they want to have any hope of escape. Everything about this is pretty simple - except for the solution of course. There are no big name actors, the story and the dilemma is straightforward, the sets are very basic. Basically you have six characters who without either explanation for the viewer or understanding for them awaken in a room that's essentially a cube. Upon exploring, they discover that the room leads only to other rooms shaped like cubes (some of which are booby trapped) and they finally realize that all these ""cube rooms"" are located inside what must be a gigantic cube. The challenge is to find a way out or die of starvation, because there is no food. Each of the characters seems to have a particular gift or talent that might be useful in finding a way out but that also leads to competitiveness and jealousy as the various characters vie for control.It's interesting to watch the group as it evolves. Starting as strangers who are suspicious of each other, they manage to meld themselves into a reasonably cohesive group, but as the situation grows more desperate that cohesiveness disappears, and they begin to descend into less and less civilized behaviour. All that is well portrayed and quite believable in the circumstances.The ending of this was disappointing to me. There was no real closure; no explanation at all of what this cube structure was or how these people were taken to it. Personally, I found that a bit unsatisfying. I suppose that leaves everything to the interpretation of the viewer. Were I to take a guess, I'd guess that these folks were like rats in a maze. They were placed there so somebody somewhere could see how they dealt with the situation. To me, that lends itself to a sense that somehow the viewer is supposed to buy into the ""alien"" theory, since there would really be no need for humans to study group dynamics in such a complex and mystifying way. But that's just a guess on my part.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Refreshing,"This movie is about a group of people trapped inside a gigantic cube, which also consists of thousands of cubic rooms, some of them with traps inside, each trap unique and efficient in slaughtering humans. Even if this kind of premise has been done to death already (Saw), Cube seemed refreshing to me. It's a very mysterious movie, the ending itself left open to the viewer's imagination, it's not really about the cube itself but about the relation between the characters and their capacity to overcome the human ego in order to solve the cubic maze. Can't really say that the human relations are what kept me interested, they're not bad but there's always that one cliché character that will make you roll your eyes, I was more fascinated about the cube itself, the reasons and ideas behind it, so yea, Cube will probably stir your imagination, later parts of the movie deepening you even further into mystery and interpretation. It's a great movie, a bit dragged down by the average characters, nonetheless a must-see.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good for those who can swallow it,This is a good movie for those people who can see past the obvious storyline and into the possibilities the movie sets up through its intentional vagueness.  It is however a very very bad movie for people who expect an omniscient POV of the goings-ons in a film.  This is definitely a movie without a guard rail; you are constantly expecting someone to get killed and wincing every time the characters enter a new room.

Certainly one that I would recommend...,"PLEASE NOTE  MILD SPOILERS WITHIN6 people wake up in a prison of multicoloured, CUBE shaped rooms, most of which are filled with traps. They have to escape.That's it? Certainly what I though when the film was introduced to me. Don't be fooled though, there is much more to CUBE than its concept would make you think.The focus in CUBE is not so much the story but the characters within it, how they interact and react to each other and what is going on around them. It explores how easily a person can 'turn' with the need to survive. CUBE is ultimately a look at human nature done in an interesting and wholly original way.Not that there isn't a good story as well, full of twists, revelations and tense moments, not to mention maths.The sets are imaginative (considering they only had one sound stage to film in and a limited budget). There are also great performances from all members of the small cast, while director Vincenzo Natali creates brilliant tension with his camera work, angles, and pacing.CUBE is probably not a film to everyone's taste, but it is certainly one that I would recommend to Sci Fi fans and / or psychological thriller fans alike, especially if you are looking for a relief from the action bred 'spoon feeding' that some films seem to provide these days. I certainly found it entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Disappointing in almost every way,"This is a movie with an intriguing idea, but which fails in almost every specific of its execution. If this had just been done as a thriller, it probably would have been quite enjoyable, but it attempts to speak to ""bigger issues"" (e.g. the government's influence on our life, the idea of the cube having its own existence and development once its hypothetical creators are long-gone) and winds up horribly pretentious and ""talky"" as a result. The characters speak in unbelievably trite one-liners that sound like they came from the pen of an ambitious junior high school student (e.g. when the angry cop tells the liberal doctor ""I spend my days cleaning up the mess your bleeding heart made""), and none of the character ""developments"" make any sense, or have any kind of emotional resonance. Without giving away anything, the ending simply left me shaking my head and muttering ""What the ****?"", implying that the ""meat"" of the movie was intended to be the juvenile character interaction and dialog that preceded it.

Intensely Suspenseful Thriller. Hitchcock Would Be Proud.,"Where do I start trying to explain one of the most original films I've ever scene. It's always a pleasure to view a low-budget film that excels in different areas and becomes a cult following. Cube not only touches your psyche, but also keeps you on the edge and makes you ask many questions along the way and even after the film is over.The movie simply throws you into the plot with no explanation as to how the people got into this giant cube or why. Even the characters don't truly know why they are there or who put them there. Most of them simply know that they were doing something prior to waking up in this cube. That along is a scary thought. All they know is that there is danger in some of the adjacent rooms that can instantly kill them. Some of them have already seen the traps and survived.As the small society discusses their options and there reasons for being there, they soon discover that each person holds a knowledgeable key for escaping. With no food or water, time isn't on their side and only a strong body, mind and the will to live will keep them moving toward their goal of escaping.To tell you much more about the film would totally ruin the surprises and there are many surprises along the way. Some of them are shocking, while others are questionable. The ending is a bit of a shocker and many viewers will be scratching their heads and staring at the screen in awe. This film definitely deserves a sequel and one was actually made called Hypercube. From the reviews I've read, it's basically the same as the first film with different characters and a few twists. None of the questions are answered from the first film, so maybe there will be a 3rd sequel in the near future that will explain EVERYTHING. That would be nice.Listen to what the other reviewers have said about this film and then go out and rent it. You have to see this film at least once. It's totally original and the script was very well written. The actors actually do a decent job even though most of them don't show much depth or chemistry.Overall the movie is a suspenseful thrill ride that's worth viewing. You'll never know what's going to happen next. There are times when the film drags alone with not much happening, but confrontations seem to be around every corner. Let's hope a 3rd film is made that will clear up questions about the CUBE and all it's mysteries.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mindf*ck,"Thats the only way to describe this movie. Strangers wake up inside a cube and then have to work together to get out in one piece. Various traps are set and they have to avoid them. The thing pulling this movie along is the incredible acting by all the cast members. They are all believable and fit their roles like a glove. There isn't much gore at all but we don't need it. The film survives on its interesting premise and great acting. If I had one complaint it would be that the film repeats itself a lot....going to each room for an hour and a half or so is quite tedious and also the movie felt a little long. Despite these flaws, it is still one of the best sci fi movies to come along in a long time. A cult classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A film as frustrating as a Rubik's Cube,"Remember the Rubik's Cube?  Remember trying to solve the Rubik's Cube?  Now, imagine being trapped inside a Rubik's Cube and trying to find your way out.That is the intriguing premise of Trimark's sci-fi film, Cube.  Five strangers wake to find themselves in a room.  The room is a cube, six walls, six doors.  It's a maze.  Enter through the correct door, you move on. Enter through the wrong door, and you set off a booby trap and can wind up burned, poisoned, or even cubed (trust me, it's not pretty).  Each room makes up a massive, giant cube containing thousands of identical rooms.  the five have no idea why they are there, or who put them there.  They must rely on each other, and their own individual abilities in order to escape.What a great set up.  Unfortunately, Cube the movie, unlike it's precision death devices in it, has a lousy execution.  It falls victim to being a low budget film that looks like a REALLY low budget, direct to video film.  the acting borders on camp, and much of the dialogue is laughable.  It also suffers from the worst film demon of them all.  The ending is downright horrendous.  Never have I been so disappointed, annoyed, and let down by a films ending than I was here.  The idea of the film is so bizarre and original, it could've been on of the most memorable sci-fi films of the late 20th century.If you don't expect too much, Cube is a mildly entertaining, albeit, forgettable film.  However, look on the bright side.  If your watching Cube, and hate it, much like that colorful '80's mind game, when you get tired of this cube, you can just set it aside and forget about it.

A metaphorical nightmare,"Imagine... you wake up in an unfamiliar, almost alien, place with no recollection of how you got there. No memory as to why anyone would put you there. Then you find out there are lethal traps in certain rooms and all the rooms looks exactly alike...That is about the extent of what this film tries to explain. The rest of it is up to the viewers and the keen ones will undoubtedly notice many hints beneath the surface narrative as to what is going on, but in the end, this is best seen as a metaphorical nightmare. Whether it is one that H.P. Lovecraft would have or one that George Orwell would have is really beside the point and it can easily be seen either way or even both at the same time. It is that lack of explanation in a well made film that can render it powerfully symbolic on many levels. It is a nightmare that scares many people and scares each one in their own way. Interestingly it is not really the film that scares you directly, it scares you indirectly. It is your own mind that scares or better yet, frightens, you as it searches for possible answers as the protagonists search for essentially the same thing.""Cube"" is so effective, because it pulls you right into what is going on screen.

But CUBE was a pleasant surprise, one of the best tension-in-a-small-group movies I've ever seen, and it's definitely thrilling. It disturbed some people obviously because it doesn't give explanations (who built the cube, how did the victims get in there etc.). It is a game and we are asked to imagine what the rules could be. There are not an awful lot of movies around that require imagination! The reason why the people inside the cube are scared to the edge of madness is not that death could strike any second - it is their lack of knowledge that makes them afraid. Algebra might save your life in the cube, but your fears, thoughts, strengths, all human qualities will matter.

A sublime trip of paranoia.,"The Cube was one of the most ingenious films that i've ever seen.The color mix along with the ""caged"" sterotype that the plot and the characters are involved with transmits the claustrophobic terror that an actually situation like that would bring.

Overall it's not a very well written movie. Production value is relatively high considering the budget but the musical score is not particularly impressive and I also feel that the cinematography could have been more effective.

What's so bad about being predictable?,"Is your life a failure because in the end, as predicted, you'll die?

Yes, it was fairly obvious that the ""retard"" would be the sole survivor, but every story is a combination of parts of the 3 or 4 unique stories.  Who's predicting what happened to him after that?I was in my 20s before I learned not to allow plot holes and continuity inaccuracies to detract from my enjoyment of the overall effect of any sort of production.  It's rather like the way people you meet can be wonderful despite numerous imperfections.  They are unique combinations of unoriginal parts.  There's a knack of not deciding until you've seen all the parts what you think.  It's worth developing.  Even so, most Hollywood trash is still trash.Everyone has to admit it was an original set.  I suspect most of the detractors saw it on a tiny screen instead of a cinema screen without distractions.  The suspension of disbelief is that much more difficult in that case.  Some of my favourite movies are loathed by people who saw the same ones on video, and I agree -- many of them are loathsome in that format.  It is very unfair on the film makers to judge from the video.I thought just enough was explained and the characters had as much depth as those of most movies that make it to Academy Awards.  If you allow the suspension of disbelief, the acting wasn't any worse than that of many famous Hollywood heart- throbs.

8 - Great,"Here's another solid psychological thriller horror-game movie for fans of Saw. In this game, the characters are placed in a giant cube which is filled with millions of room-sized cubes, with doors on all 6 sides. The goal is to escape before you die. And in some of the rooms there are deadly traps. One of the characters has a method of throwing a shoe into the room to see if anything triggers, but once he's fried, the gang realizes they need a new strategy.Thankfully, the doors all contain numbers and with mathematical equations you can navigate your way out. You can calculate which doors are traps and which lead you in the right direction. The whole game and system are mathematically coherent, unlike the contrived ones in the later Cube films. Unfortunately, there's also the human factor and one doesn't only have to worry about the traps, but the other players as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Thoroughly scary psycho horror.,"Since the entire movie set probably consisted of two rooms with red, blue, green and white lights behind it, this is probably the best basic horror idea I've seen made into a movie in years.

People probably do strange things when they think they're going die for no particular reason at all, and it's good to see that none of the psychological problems the characters face are far-fetched. They're ordinary everyday-life kind of problems. It's just that the movie's not set in everyday-kind-of-life circumstances. Pretty believable I should say. (Not counting the cube-thing...)

"Great concept, bad actors","I just kind of stumbled onto this movie so I had absolutely no idea what it was about.  Didn't even see any shots of the movie itself, nor the cover art.Going in, I'd have to say the premise is one of the best I've heard so far. All these people, all so very different, situated in one small area with one common potentially lethal dilemma.  It's fantastic.  They never revealed how they got there or who put them there but that's part of what makes it good. About 30 minutes into the movie, it dawned on me that this is basically something like a Tales From the Darkside or a Twilight Zone that got made into a movie.  Both those shows were primarily made of great stories woven around a small number of characters and cheap sets.  This is what the movie basically was.  If you liked those shows, you'll enjoy this movie.The only drawback I saw were the acting.  Some of the primary characters, the cop for one, absolutely sucked.  It was nice how he tried to appear the nice leader at first and changed, but overall that guy is not a very good actor.  The autistic guy was horrible as well.  Must all autistic people be good at math or have good memory?  Well, in Hollywood they all do it seems. Worth's character was very well acted though.  I liked him a lot and hope to see more in the future.I'll admit though that one bad showing doesn't mean they'll always be bad. Just look at Hillary Swank from The New Karate Kid and then compare that to Boys Don't Cry.Overall I gave it a 8.  Worthy of a rental for sure.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good Premise - (Trite Ending + Bad Math) = So So Movie,"I've read most of the reviews for this movie.  My vote goes with the folks who thought it was a good idea that just didn't work out.One comment I didn't see --  Was anyone else put off by the simplicity of the math element?  I'm trying not to be pretentious, but really, the girl is a math student.  Her first inclination is that booby traps are given away by the presence/absence of a prime number in the room's doorway.  She tests her theory, looking at a number -- ""602.  Uh, let's see.""  She thinks for a while, ""not prime.""  Duh.  Didn't the girl learn in elementary school that any number that ends in 2 is divisible by 2?  Next number: 905.  Hmmm. Maybe divisible by 5?  Now I'm thinking that if the girl is a math student, she's a really *bad* math student.Ultimately she defers to the autistic member of the crowd to solve a problem she should have been doing in her head by her freshman year.This might sound nit-picky, but the math turns out to be a big part of the plot.  For me, at least, it was a distraction.  Aside from the let-down slasher-type ending, and the not-quite-delivered premise, the movie fails to have a truly clever plot.  If you're looking for one, and you remember how to factor numbers, you're not going to find it here.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A Thrilling and Surprisingly Thoughtful Little Gem,"I know that this film is very well known, but I don't believe that it is generally given due credit for its accomplishments, which are myriad. Despite the surprisingly low budget for the production, director Vincenzo Natali succeeds at crafting a very taut, interesting, and extremely well-paced thriller with very fleshed out characters, a rarity in the science fiction horror genre. Throughout the film's 80 minute runtime, not only is the audience able to observe the very well-designed, claustrophobic and surreal sets progress seemingly into infinity, but also the excellent dialogue between the characters further develop them as very believable people. While this film is replete with the usual scares and thrilling set pieces for which this genre is known, it goes the extra mile by remaining totally unpredictable on a story level throughout. From the beginning to final sequence, no character's motivations, backstory, or final outcome are known for certain. With the claustrophobic atmosphere and very good acting from all around, Natali invites the audience to dive deep into the depths of human suspicion, paranoia, and ultimate decline when placed in unconquerable situations. However, while this is a significant part of the film, what truly put Cube over the top for me was its surprising subtext regarding not only the typical topics encountered in science fiction horror fare, but also a far more broad and relatable human message of the struggle to maintain some sense of being and purpose in the face of purposelessness. Perhaps I am reading too deeply into this by making these claims, but I feel that the titular Cube may represent life as a whole; a series of seemingly pointless choices and pitfalls in the form of a puzzle. Only by perseverance through even the darkest depths of human psychology can anyone hope to escape the labyrinth and achieve transcendence. The film's ending, though I won't spoil it, gives new meaning to this message, and leaves much food for thought. Despite all of this praise, I can't quite bring myself to give this film a 10. There are a few very clichéd moments in the film, near the beginning especially, and only around the 25 minute mark does it really begin to feel like something entirely original. However, once it does, it becomes an immersive and potent piece of science fiction.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Tom Keogh,"If Clive Barker had written an episode of The Twilight Zone, it might have looked something l...(read more...)like Cube. A handful of strangers wake up inside a bizarre maze, having been spirited there during the night. They quickly learn that they have to navigate their way through a series of chambers if they have any hope of escape, but the problem is that there are lethal traps awaiting if they choose their route unwisely. Having established some imaginative and grisly punishments in store for the hostages, co-writer and director Vincenzo Natali turns his attention to the characters, for whom being trapped amplifies their best and worst qualities. The film is, in fact, similar to a famous episode of Rod Serling's old television series, though Natali's explanation for why these poor people are being put through hell is a lot closer to the spirit of The X-Files. Cube has some solid moments of suspense and drama, and the sets are appropriately striking: one is tempted to believe at first the characters are lost inside a computer chip. --Tom Keogh",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fluff & Rehash -- but enjoyable nonetheless,"Commenters rave about Cube's character development?  Puh-leese!  And they complain about the sets?  I don't get it.This film is a rehash of the old Avengers episode ""The House That Jack Built.""  But instead of Jake Steed & Emma Peel, we have a set of caricatures (yes, caricatures, not characters!).  Among them, the waifish logical math whiz, the fascist brutish cop, the bleeding-heart liberal, the guilty engineer-of-death, and, of course, Rain Man.The set(s) and execution of the use of one repeated set (plus some edge-of-cube-work) works extremely well.  A bit of color and some different numbers, with a continually incomplete puzzle, makes for a continually interesting premise.Of course, the premise breaks apart if you actually pay attention to the math (in relationship to their actions).Aside from the caricatures in place of characters, what disappointed me was the implausibility of the ending -- who survives, and why.",,Anonymous,Mystery

The Movie Which Didn't Stand The Test Of Time,"When I first watched this bizarre low-budget Canadian film, I was impressed. Years after, I have tried it again - and immediately all the weaker points went visible - very weak acting, poor script, long (too long) dialog parts at times, boring sequences, and yeah, the film didn't hold - it fell apart, before it got exciting. The trite plot betrayed shallow characters, limp psyche and lame ideas. What was more shocking, there was no compassion or interest in any of the heroes, be that Kazan or Leaven. They all seem bland, gray and one- dimensional, and in case with Quentin, a promising beginning gave way to a very disastrous under-developed hell of a terrible person. The Cube seemed to be in the same league like Lawnmower Man - once, it was awesome, very soon later - awful. There are low-budget movies which can deliver fun or thrill.

lord of the flies,"I heard so much about the movie before watching it. Then I finally rented it out and watched it. I must say I was a bit disappointed. The authors of the movie, albeit very young and inexperienced, should have formed or decided on the genre of the movie more accurately. By that I mean that they combined a thriller with human psychology and the movie turned out to be rather weak on both parts. I focused more on the psychological part of the movie, as I am not really a sci-fi or thriller fan, but instead expected much more from the dialogues and cast performance. Actually, the dialogues were quite stereotypical and vague, I must say I expected them to be much profounder and thought provoking. The development of the state of mind of each character as they move through the cube should have been given more emphasis to, maybe more research should have been done ... This aspect of the movie really reminded me of the Lord of the flies by Golding, however the latter was much more interesting and enigmatic.",,Anonymous,Mystery

A para-normal thriller of great proportions,"""Cube"" is not a movie for the average viewer.

It is harrowing, poignant, terrifying, thoughtful, disturbing, thought-provoking, and fascinating as the plot unfolds.  The conclusion begs for clarification, as I hope the sequel to ""Cube"" will provide.  I happened to see ""Cube"" almost accidentally, as I simply was seeking to view something not showing at the majority of theaters in my town.

A poor example of a well-known theme,"This film is a poor example of a well-known theme: stick a bunch of seemingly unrelated, very different people together in a stressful situation and see what comes of it.  This is a risky thing to do because it requires excellent scriptwriting and characters. Unfortunately, Cube did not have these things.The characters are flat, two-dimensional caricatures that are irritating and over-the-top almost immediately.  The things that matter, ie a meaningful explanation of who built the cube and why (rather than the characters' own speculations) are left unresolved, which is unfortunate because this type of information, for this film at least, would have made it a much better movie. The set could only distract me from the characters, bad dialogue and plodding plot for a short time. I left the cinema with the feeling of having seen a pretty dull movie, and the gory opening sequence just seemed like a cheap shock tactic in hindsight.I agree with Steve from Queensland. Hitchcock did it better.  Go out and hire Hitchcock's ""Lifeboat"", or the sci-fi remake from about ten years ago, ""Lifepod"".

Bleak but endlessly inventive Canadian sci-fi,"""Cube"" is certainly a unique movie.  With only one set to play with, the movie sustains the interest throughout.  Basically, it's high concept stuff. Six manifestly incompatible characters are trapped inside a massive cube full of interconnected rooms, some of which contain deadly traps.  All the characters have to do to escape is avoid the traps, work out the structure of the cube and try to get on with each other.  Unfortunately, it's the latter that proves hardest, as the movie decides to illustrate Sartre's dictum that hell is other people.  The movie has several scenes of almost unbearable tension - I was wincing and hiding my face when the characters faced a room which they could only pass through if they remained silent. There are also a couple of startling, gory scenes early on.  The film's twists are always well thought out, and the scenes containing the group slugging it out with their emotional problems are devastating.  The problem, however, is that some of the characters seem a little pat - they become stereotypes, and the acting is rarely good enough to hide the stilted characterization.  That said, if you like mathematical puzzles, or you just like a movie that has ideas and is prepared to follow them through, you should check this one out.

Like Cube itself this film is a work of (evil) genius,"I watched Cube again a few days ago and got far more out of it the first time. It's one of those films which creates a mood and leaves you thinking about it for days afterwards, kind of alters the way you look at things. I think that is what film making at its best is all about.Cube is a terrifying film, a kind of Orwell/ Huxley nightmare. Somehow a group of people have been trapped in an endless maze of cubic rooms some containing the most lethal traps. Their task, presumably - they are given no instructions - is to avoid the traps and find the exit before they die of hunger and thirst. It's a terrifying thought that innocent people can be taken from their own homes in the middle of the night and transported to such a cruel and devilishly sophisticated experiment. You wonder who could have the power to do such a thing: the characters speculate, government, a Bond style supervillain? but they never can find out for sure, no evil genius ever presents himself and indeed it would be a total letdown if they did. The main character in the story is the implacible Cube itself, an endless 3D maze of 14ft-on-a-side cubic rooms each with 6 exits to ajacent rooms (including ceiling and floor). There are no windows of course and each room is lit by its glowing walls. Different rooms have different colours, red, blue, green and white and this brilliantly adds to the eerie feel and look of the film. Each coloured room has an atmosphere of its own, the white ones of definitely the most cheery, its as bright as daylight and you can see the colours clearly: but there is no guarantee that a white room doesn't contain a trap, in fact there seems to be no correspondance between colours and traps, that would be too easy.But there is a way to get through the maze, each room has a number written along its edges and its possible to work out a way out from that, provided you have enough mathematical ability. The cube is already mathematical in terms of being such an ideal geometric structure and this ""number theory"" twist adds greatly to the intrigue. It involves the audience as they try to solve the puzzle themselves and also gives the characters something to do. Some of the characters - is it coincidence - do have mathematical ability.There are five characters in the film, as you might expect they are an eclectic bunch with more than usual amounts of emotional problems and eccentricities. Imagine waking up in a cubic room with nothing but identical rooms all around! After coping with the shock and rising terror, the characters set off to find a way out and naturally different personalities start to assert themselves. Some characters are natural leaders others are more thoughtful. Some hopeful of a way out, others just despair accepting death as inevitable. It turns out that one if tangentially responsible for building the cube in the first place adding to the paranoid feeling that NO ONE IS SAFE.The acting in this film is excellent, you really believe in the whole cube concept from the start. The actors really make you feel how frightening and disorienting it would be and there is superbly believable and fascinating interactions between them as they each find their place in this frightened little group. Although they cope well there is throughout a sense of underlying tension, a feeling of just-controlled panic, which is exactly how you would feel in that situation! There is good character development too as the movie goes on and we find out more about each character's lives and personalities.The directing and cinematography of the film are superb, the whole concept of Cube is just amazing and the visuals do full justice to it. The look of the film is reminiscent of Kubrick at his most spooky and disorienting. There is one scene in particular where the characters are trying to get though a sound-activated trap. One by one they crawl through it in total silence gesturing to each other. I was scared to make any sound myself, it was completely electric! It takes a daring director to have five minutes of silence in a film and this really paid off. It reminded my particularly of 2001 EVA scenes.If I have a complaint at all it is about the ending. I wont reveal it of course, but I would have prepared something happier. After all they've been through, I would have preferred to see the characters succeed, especially cynical worth and the mathematical girl, they really deserved to get out. I would have rewritten the last few seconds, but nothing else.The 3D maze known as Cube is a work of evil genius created by persons of institutions unknown. I would say this film is also a work of genius, not evil but certainly terrifying, disturbing and deeply moving. I would definitely recommend it, but be prepared for some sleepless nights... (and an obsessive interest in prime numbers!)",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I could guess the tone of the film and I made all kinds of predictions about the plot from that first scene, and I was totally right.The film was low budget garbage, with stupid characters, unrealistic conflicts, and a plot that is not really engaging. The dialogue is atrocious and there is never a sense that it is going anywhere. Indeed, neither the conflict between characters nor the search for the solution to the puzzle they are facing provide a payoff. In the end we are treated first to a solution that seems to fall from the sky, in which the audience cannot participate. Then, as though that's not enough, we have one of those over the top, absurd endings that are supposed to pack an emotional punch, but end up just alienating the audience. This is a bad film that manages to have an even worse ending than one might expect.'Cube' is a very disappointing viewing experience because we are made to endure a lot of suffering along with the characters and we are not treated to an ending that makes it worth while. They took the audience into the 'cube' and when they let us out, we were left wondering why. There is no insight, no purpose, no catharsis. Just a feeling you got cheated.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Set but melodramatic,"This low cost, Sci fi, high tech, lowly acted, Canadian psychological and mathematical thriller with a great set, offers plenty from the shorts for the slice and dice fans. The film begins with a fellow stepping into a room and being literally sliced by razor wire into cubes, sliced and diced. Horror fans will like the look of that! But Cube will leave you wondering.Wondering what? A group of Canadians wake up in a deadly prison which consists of a series of cubes with a door in the middle of each of the six walls. There are strange metallic rumblings every few minutes and certain death waits if they do nothing.Step through the wrong door and they're likely to die a horrible if quick death.  But step through doors they must or they will die from thirst. Or much worse, they will have to suffer from being stuck with the others, none of whom you would pick to retire with to a tropical island. But why are they there in the first place? Kafka's monstrous bug and Orwell's 1984 springs to mind.Cube is full of desperate musings on who would have built this monstrous prison. ""Only the government could have built something this ugly"" is a memorable line. But don't look for anything too thoughtful in Cube even if getting out of the maze eventually becomes a mathematical puzzle, which progressively becomes ethereal enough to isolate the drama even further from most movie goers.And even my poor maths could pick holes in the numbers. It doesn't take much math to know that an even number can never be prime, but suddenly producing a Rain Man style autistic savant was a bit rich!The film is left  to hinge only on its set which is strong but the rest, the most important bits, the characters, have been dealt with very poorly. Who cares who survives?This sort of psychological drama is a classic Hitchcock, marooned in a lifeboat scenario. Claustrophobia, isolation and fear is a terrific recipe for drama but then it's handy if there are characters with depth, a director with ability and actors who can act. I suspect that Alfred would have made much more of his characters if he had got hold of this script.The doctor, the criminal, the bureaucrat, the student, the cop and assorted others are ineffectively handled. They never rise beyond being shadows of personalities and the drama becomes progressively melodramatic.Why were they put in the cube? Perhaps they deserved it. After a while we would wonder if any of them are worth saving anyway, especially if they live in a community that would build such a thing as the Cube. But hey, that's just nasty. (The Cube became pretty boring at times, encouraging those sorts of ideas. )But still Cube is memorable, if only for the total set, the total cube when it is finally revealed. It's just a shame that you are never encouraged to become caring about the characters.And then there's the ending, which is a total cop out unless you believe that there is no meaning, for anything. Then you will leave the theatre suitably perplexed.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Intriguing,"I finally saw this, and it is really good. I was entertained and compelled all the way through. The semi-disappointing ending makes me rate it an ""8""...but the ambiguity of the ending is also what makes it a movie that people need to have discussions about afterwards.The movie shows that the human beast is more deadly than this giant death cube of astronomical possibilities.

An exceptional disturbing movie,"It is not often, that you buy a movie you've never heard of. I first heard about the movie a week ago (July 2002), and I read on the cover what the plot was about. It sounded so exciting that I bought it right away. The movie satisfied my expectations too! A brilliant concept, where everyone starts in a zero-position, and as the movie goes on, the viewer get to know more and more of the cube. The people in the cube can be a symbol of a society, which contains all the parts that are needed to be complete. Everyone knows their things, and that keeps them developing during the whole movie. Also, the desperation and the anger are growing inside everyone of them during the movie, which shows the human nature.. and the strongest one's will survive. (?) A movie worth seeing, definitely!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the truly great ideas,"Truly a great movie, if for nothing else, than an incredible premise. Recently, it has seemed as if movies have been rehashing old ideas, remakes of classic movies (Godzilla, Psycho, the seemingly millions of Scream copies). But, Cube is special and interesting to watch because it made me shake with anticipation. A thrill from the first to last scene.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not as affective as I had hoped it would be,"Moral of the story:-
You should never skip your math classes.Jokes apart, this is a good survival thriller with an interesting idea and a decent execution. While the film itself fared well enough in terms of concept, it just couldn't leave its mark in the end. I mean, yes, I did like it for what it is and I'm also well aware of the fact that when it first came out, it became an instant hit, and all the viewers were amused. But the thing is with an abundance of similar works in recent times, it would take much more than a mere idea to make a solid impression these days.Let's just say, the film hasn't aged well, has it?",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Less is More.,"I love films that can take a small, confined location, and make a big movie out of it.  Despite being inside the cube, this movie feels big.  It's a taut, thrilling sci-fi film, with a quiet intelligence.  Go Canadian film! It's always interesting, that's for sure.  And Cube is no exception.  If you want a smart, interesting drama, this is it.  Very cool idea and movie.",,Anonymous,Mystery
CUBE should be considered a cinema CLASSIC,"I have seen so many critics On-line about this movie. I don't agree with them at all. I think CUBE should be considered a classic, because we can recognize some of our human qualities on it, and the people on CUBE represent people living on Earth. In a Place, that can be paradise if we take the best of us and put it on service to the other. This is what happens in the movie. There is people there that undestand that they don't live alone and work with the other to find the exit to a better place. And there is people, as the cop, that doesn't understand it at all and think that the other people in the CUBE is there to be USED to his profit, to find the exist. He doesn´t care about them. As a conclusion the movie should be a classic because it is a single situation that you can translate to all the world, is something universal. It is a good reflexion, quite pessimistic, in line with Sartre, about our world. Let's make world a better place. ROD-JOE.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A low-budget Canadian precursor to Saw,"The world of Canadian movies is usually highly unknown or...well....crap. Of course every so often something comes along to prove this different. First there was Heavy Metal, an excellent animated film, and then there was Cube.Cube came out of the Canadian government's plan to fund the Canadian film industry in order to increase quality and make a name for Canadian filmmakers. Cube came out of this, but was unfortunately under-represented.Cube is an excellent view of the human element, more specifically how people react when placed in a stressful and life-threatening situation. For those who have not heard of this movie before may find this sounding familiar: The idea behind Saw.Vincenzo Natali created an excellent element of tension and mystery created simply in a 14' by 14' cube. For being a very simplistic and low-budget creation, this movie does not disappoint. And while the sequels are not of the same level, I highly recommend viewing them for the whole story.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"From now on, every room you go in will look a little smaller","I was surprised that this was 2 years old! It has just appeared down at the local video shop and is as refreshing and sharp as you could hope for.The film's strength is that it keeps it simple. The performances are good as are the characters themselves, though they need to be in this kind of film (ie, folk stuck in a boat, lift, submarine, cube, whatever..)If you bump into this at least give it a rent - you won't be disappointed - the most pleasant surprise of the year so far.Scoops",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Terrible,"I don't know how the above reviewer could say anything positive about this film. My friend and I (who have both sat through some pretty terrible movies) were laughing throughout the entire film because of the terrible acting.The cop's performance alone is enough to make this movie a joke. He's easily the worst performer of the group, which is saying something.Also, the movie falls prey to SO MANY clichés it was staggering. I mean, what kind of person suddenly remembers where they last were before appearing in the cube and shouts out ""pasta!"" to the rest of the befuddled prisoners? Is that supposed to make ANY sense??? Of course not, it only happens so that, just like every other terrible movies, the other characters can be all puzzled and ask what the woman means so that she can go into further detail beyond just the word 'pasta.'It doesn't make any sense.ALso, the idea that NO ONE in the cube could have possibly figured out that those strange groaning noises meant the cubes were all moving is ludicrous. My friend and I knew what was happening the very first time we heard the noise, it's just logical. All in all, a very, very bad movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Ridiculous Characters in an Interesting Dilemma,"The Cube was a conflicted experience for me.  On one hand, I enjoyed the premise.  The sparse, eerie atmosphere generated by the film's weird setting was interesting and generally very consistent.  I was especially pleased that the filmmakers avoided exploiting the more gruesome realities of life inside The Cube, playing up its aspects as a mathematical puzzle rather than throwing twenty buckets of blood at the screen.Unfortunately, all of this began to seem trivial when the unspeakably annoying characters began to open their mouths.  Each one, to the last man and woman, is a cardboard cutout with a couple of traits slapped on for good measure.  This wouldn't be such an obviously bad thing if only they didn't have to talk so much... but talk they do.  So for an hour and a half I was bombarded with simplistic social commentary, half-baked philosophical yammering, and enough ham to fill any number of good New York delis.  It was like reading a stack of term papers from Remedial Ethics 101; or rather, having them yelled at me by some actors.  And every word of this goofy stuff is delivered with such sincerity...  by the halfway mark I'd gone from rolling my eyes and giggling to full on laughter.So I really wanted to like this movie, and I still kind of do, but in the same way that I enjoy Ed Wood films.  The combination of genuinely interesting ideas, good technical execution, and unintentionally hilarious dialogue is just so very strange.  Perhaps I'm intellectually stunted and have missed out on the treasure trove of marvelous insights this film has offered me, but I doubt it.  In any case, I'd have to recommend checking out The Cube with an open mind and drawing your own conclusions.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Put five people in a box and watch them squirm.,"I originally watched ""Cube"" at a film festival that was on in town. I was anticipating it a great deal as the idea was reasonably original and I liked the sound of it.  I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed.For me, ""Cube"" was suspense. Each of the characters could either be seen as an individual or as a typical character archetype.  Either way the most impressive feature about the film was the raw emotion I felt.  Through the style of shots and overall sound you are kept in suspense the whole way through.I do have a number of points though.  For one, the appearance of the sound boom in the first scene in the first cube, even though it must have been intentional (it better have been) it did seem quite out of place, and I don't care what meaning you attach to it, you don't show the equipment.Secondly, the acting did seem a little contrived.  Right from the word go I was not convinced of the reality of the characters, but interestingly enough grew to like the nihilistic character.  He was the only character to go through some sort of change, everyone else suffered a mental breakdown and had a mental collapse.Lastly, the ending.  Very soft.  It could've been more, but it will do. It leaves you hanging, but that's about it.  There's no gratification and in the end the end has to be my least favourite part of the movie.At any rate, a very good film that I would recommend to people, purely for the atmosphere, but definitely not for the characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
SF-Psychothriller,"The ending was not as good as the rest of the movie. The why and what was left out at all. Some good scary scenes. Many dark rooms with scarce light. It's like crawling in a maze, but you don't know where the way out is - if there is any...",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
