Detractors of this film were fooled by the trailer.,"American Gangster has been really hated upon in many of the former posts I have read. Yet it seems like they are all saying the same thing, that Gangster didn't have enough action and was really drawn out. Anyone who has every seen a Ridley Scott film will know that his films are long! Blade Runner, A Good Year, Matchstick Men, Hannibal, Black Hawk Down, Gladiator, G.I. Jane, Thelma and Louis, and Alien all ran for at least two hours or more, so big surprise there guys. In addition Scott didn't set out to film another scarface, he set out to tell a story not just about Frank Lucas but rather a tale of corruption and how pervasive it is. One user commented that this film had many side story lines that ""bloated"" the story. This is completely untrue as every ""side story"" is actually the overarching story about the fight against corruption in every facet of life, even Frank Lucas attempts several times to eradicate the corruption in his organization.Over all this is a great film which really gets into every nook and cranny of an issue. Don't see this film if your just looking for cheap thrills, this is a thinking film about the pervasive dishonesty of our culture.I gave this film 8 stars because i could find nothing solid that detracted from it, but rather a slew of minor details which gradually brought its score down. But I will put this film in my top films for the year, if only because I have been immensely unsatisfied with the bulk of releases this year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"""My Man""","Ridley Scott's new flick American Gangster was a good one. Though Im not gonna be saying it's the best film of the year or anything like that. It was directed well, barely any dull scenes, great acting by an enormous cast and was really well-written. Unfortunately the story never seemed ""new"" to me. I was reminded of other drug-related/crime movies, like BLOW, CITY OF GOD, and evening TRAINING DAY.....""My Man"". Though it's in the leagues as being entertaining as the above mentioned movies, it really just never felt like I was watching a ""new"" story. But speaking of story, I never knew anything about Frank Lucas, and his story is fantastic. A black man who was more influential than his Mafian brethren? Tell me you're kidding. Nope, he was a force in Harlem back in the late 60s and early 70s and barely anyone knows about it. But for me this area of the film was the only stand out part. Sure there are other good scenes, done well, but nothing worth mentioning. Well, scratch that, naked women workin in a drug lab was an eye-opening scene.Denzel Washington won the Oscar when he portrayed the crooked cop in Training Day who said ""My Man"" all the time. Well, in the American Gangster you got him saying this line again, and by God does he have it down. There are scenes when you know he's gonna say it, and he still pulls it off incredibly well. Denzel is one actor you really never have to worry about it in the acting department. You've got Russell ""Mr. Oscar"" Crowe playing the other lead, and like always, he always has the character down. He was great in this flick, the accent, the mannerisms, all of it. Though, his character's story was interesting in that he was in charge of the case to figure out who the big boy druglords were, his side story with his wife was for me the ""dull"" parts of the film. They were well-acted and all that, but mostly, it was just character development that isn't needed. Russell Crowe's good enough an actor to portray a struggling cop without a family problem. And also let me say Josh Brolin as the crooked cop was great. I didn't need a side-story of him doing tons of drugs and banging prostitutes....but ya know he was doing it.American Gangster was a really good flick. It had amazing acting mixed with scenes that shed a new light on drug-trafficking....or should I say Old light. Though since there are so many other drug/crime cop films out there it seems a little been there done that. But don't let that sway you if you enjoy good movies and or crime films. And also, Frank Lucas is one hell of an interesting personality. My man. 8.5 outta 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
well-acted gritty characters,"It's 1968 Harlem. Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) is the right hand man to Robin Hood gangster Bumpy Johnson. When Bumpy dies, Frank tries to take over. He becomes a powerful gangster importing heroin directly from the South East Asian jungle source. Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin) leads a group of corrupt cops reselling seized drugs back on the street. Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is a rough and tumble honest cop who tracks down the source for the heroine which killed his partner. Meanwhile Lucas faces against mob boss Dominic Cattano (Armand Assante) and Trupo.It's a vast interconnected crime drama with deep complex well-written characters played by some of the best actors around. It's gritty and dark with good flashes of the Ridley Scott style. It references the French Connection. It doesn't have quite the immediate realism of the documentary style movie. However, Scott is able to meticulously recreate it. Both Washington and Crowe are powerful in their separate sides of the story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Surprisingly Coherent,"Watch American Gangster without preconceived ideas. While the film is long it never drags. You don't get the sense that you've seen this movie before. It's not Serpico. It's not The Wire. It's not The Sopranos. While much is going on, the story is easy to follow. There is action, but this isn't an ""action movie"".Both Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe act convincingly and give depth to their characters.The film leaves you wanting to know more about about happened to the lead characters. You care about them that much. Now *that's* film making.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Ridley Rocks!,"Finally a good, accurate, gangster drug-trafficking film that makes you think. It's far from Polyanna and lets no-one group off; not gangsters of any race or ethnicity, not cops on the take, addicts, etc. And importantly, the story, based upon the true life story of Frank Lucas, does not profile a stereotypical black gangster gone wrong but instead shows an elegant, intellectual man who rises to the top of his game but then learns something new in the end. The film is a sure-shot into the Oscars but more importantly, for me, it's a film that is socially responsible and imparts a thoughtful message for any viewer,especially in light of current times.Technically, it's got it all going on. Script,Camera, lighting,and not only par excellence from Crowe and Washington but the entire acting cast. The film uses fabulous close-ups and unbelievably good action shots. I disagree with any reviews that claim the movie is not packed with enough action or violence. How tiresome that would be! Instead, while including some of the best action/violent shots ever filmed, Mr. Ridley gives us a relevant and real-life look into the narcotics business top-to-bottom and across the board. I would far prefer to see a movie that has a dozen or so magnificently staged violent shots that dare to go deeper and translate both internal as well as external motivations as to depict real life. The film is not only entertaining; its portrayal is authentic to the real life grizzly and sometimes grayed world of crime/justice as well as didactic and amazingly...uplifting. What a nice surprise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A cops and gangsters classic!,"Starting off, this probably shouldn't be grouped in as a mob film. For one, Crowe's character is as much the lead as Denzel, this is a cops catching the criminal movie. But also, there's not much mob, it's Frank Lucas at the top and everyone else trying to attach to him, he's one man and that is made very clear.American Gangster works on numerous levels. It's in part a portrait of late 60s-early 70s Harlem and America, full of drugs and desperation and weakness, where the strong rise above the rest and the cops are dirtier than the rats. As a crime thriller it's entertaining and at 2 hours 37 minutes, never loses interest. But, maybe most surprisingly, it's also a superb character drama and study. Literally every character who steps on screen is compelling, has depth to them, has their motivations, and is tossed into conflict. For example there's a scene early on where Crowe's character Richie and his partner are searching a parked car and find a very large amount of unmarked money in the trunk. Without giving away more, it and the following scenes lead to some surprising moral and character statements by Scott. Richie's morals vs everyone else the temptation of the streets is commonly laid on him throughout the film, and thanks to Crowe's great great performance, it adds a lot to the movie.Denzel is brilliant here. Frank Lucas, with his collected yet fiery, always powerfully menacing performance is one of the better king bosses I can think of in recent memory. When he's not talking, just the way his face is set, he totally totally gets in this character. The academy would do right to easily give him a nomination this year. I also wanted to add that while the two leads don't get on screen till the last 20 minutes, they have a long extended scene that is pure dynamite and gold. They play off each other perfectly and it's well worth the build-up, and maybe are among the highlights of each performance.Going through supporting actors, Josh Brolin gives one of the year's most surprising performances as an insufferable and despicable dirty cop. He's so slimy, money-grubbing, and yet intelligent and an equal, he's just cunning. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is decent in his one scene, though it's hampered by being mostly unneeded. Chiwetal Ejifor makes a believable side character though he's not given as much to do, and finally I think Ruby Dee could be a sleeper Best Supporting Actress contender for her role as Mama Lucas. Every other short and thankless role I didn't mention is acted superbly here as well, it's a sign of a great director that they're all so on their game.Ridley Scott's direction, brilliant, what can you say. He creates New York and the rats living in it to the point with fantastic attention to detail, and most of the scenes in the film are shot and constructed simply perfectly. This includes the short but brutally effective opening scene, which stands as one of the more memorable openings I've seen in a while. Actually any time there's gunplay or action, even if there isn't that much overall, it's stunning. Particularly, at the end there's a police raid scene that stands as the ""holyyyy crap"" sequence of the film. Going from a hallway to a heroine preparing apartment, and without revealing anything more, it's incredible, simply incredible. Remember when people were going nuts over the tracking shot gimmick in Children of Men? I felt that way about this one. If there's a god, Ridley will finally pick up his directing Oscar this year, he deserves it for this and his wide career.American Gangster is probably one of the best cop-based films I've seen, and up there with gangster ones. It does one of the best jobs of examining the rise and fall of a crime or drug boss right from the beginning, and dives right into on the other side what it means to be a cop and to strive for something, as well as just telling an awesome and magnificently directed gangster story.One of the year's very finest films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A Solid Film,"Unfortunately from listening to everyone else I was expecting some sort of masterpiece. That is not what I believe what I got. Yet it was still a very good movie.The acting performances were also good but not great. Denzel Washington gave a very good performance but not Oscar worthy, it felt like I have seen this before from him. Russell Crowe just was not given the room to actually act. I wish Crowe would have been given more of an opportunity to show off his talent. Josh Brolin gave the best performance as a corrupt police officer. He displayed perfectly the corrupt cop blackmailing both sides for the benefit of himself. I do not really understand the Oscar nomination for Ruby Dee playing Frank Lucas mother. She barley even had a cameo in this movie. It is kind of sad to see how far Cuba Gooding Jr. has fallen not having much of a role in this movie.What really kept this movie up and kind of brought it down was its steady flow and writing. It did show you some interesting things such as going to Vietnam and having a very unique and surprising place to smuggle in the drugs. Yet as I mentioned before the performances were good but not great because of the writing. I attribute this to the writing. Some of the writing did not allow some of the actors to expand as much as they could have on their roles.Also the directing was very good but not great. Ridley Scott did show some interesting scenes and had good camera shot. The cinematography was good as well. Yet because the performances were not to great that brings him down because his job to guide arguably two of the best actors today.This movie was a bit over-hyped but I would still recommend it. This probably could have received more recognition from the Oscars though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Gripping Characters/Frightening Events,"I guess this is a fictional retelling of actual events. The character of Frank (Denzel Washington) is the story of a man, who because of his own issues with the abuse of being a black man with few prospects, driven to become ""great."" Unfortunately, his greatness is tied up in exporting pure heroin from Vietnam and selling it. He is a murderer, a liar, and every way a criminal. He is charming on the outside and deadly on the inside. There is no way that a thinking person could admire him. If his vendetta and his business were directed only at bad guys, we might think that it is OK. But he kills indiscriminately, many dying as innocent victims. Russell Crowe's prosecutor is determined and insightful. He is himself a loner (a role Crowe does well at in many films), but he must butt heads all the way along. He has committed a ""crime."" He has found and returned thousands of dollars in drug money found on a case. He is seen as a bit of an idiot and hence not on of ""the guys."" Everything plays out well. Two masterful actors doing what they do best. I think my most memorable scene is the one where they come upon the poppy fields in Vietnam where this stuff is being cooked and dried. It would be like going to SonyCorp or some big Asian business; but this is a factory used to make one of the most destructive substances. See this because it is a fascinating story and it is masterfully done.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"a big, intense American crime movie, led by stars and director in top form","American Gangster seems on the surface to be what has been dubbed by some critics as ""the black Scarface."" As Ridley Scott's new film details, this isn't really the case aside from the point of 'rose up from nothing became something through crime', which could be said about almost every gangster film including the Godfather. Here Scott and screenwriter Steve Zaillian, without calling attention to it ala Paul Haggis, have made a film about class issues underneath the typical gangster-movie form. Even more than the Departed, one sees as the film goes on an environment of paradox: Frank Lucas was a low-life, a killer, a ruthless thug, and at the same time found time to take his mother to church every Sunday and gave out turkeys to folks in the neighborhood while providing them enough dope to die off in the process.In fact, Scarface has got nothing on Frank Lucas when it comes to moral complexity: here's a man who did rise up out of poverty, learned the stakes of gang life as a driver for the Harlem boss for fifteen years, and then after he died cut out the middle-man as an importer of the freshest product of heroin right out of Vietnam. Then through this there's a whole other level to American Gangster; Scott and Zaillian could have made it simply a saga of betrayals and investigation via Richie Roberts. But the side that one saw in Serpico is amplified here- it becomes all the more engrossing to see how the crooked cops and ""honest"" gangster Lucas were linked together, which also leads to an ending that amps up the interest. Lucas didn't get out like Henry Hill, but a good man all the same? Probably not (he ended up in jail again, as the film doesn't point out).So there's a lot of story to explore, and Scott makes it one of the most invigorating, nostalgic (ironically speaking) New York crime films in years, as far as the storytelling goes. And like Heat, Scott gets a lot of mileage from his star power. Washington goes even deeper into the role of the villain than he did in Training Day- he plays him as classic family man, cold businessman, and charming man-of-the-community. He makes it so much his role that you can't imagine anyone else going down a Harlem street shooting a guy point blank in the head. And Crowe also adds some good subtlety to the piece, a flawed man with his family and someone who tries to keep his morality straight (the million dollars given in to the station) amidst total bully-crooks like Josh Brolin's ""special"" detective. By the time the two stars finally sit down for one scene, it's on par with De Niro and Pacino.Why not a 10/10 or 4 stars? It is, despite a rightfully fleshed out narrative, with some unnecessary bits (Cuba Gooding Jr, what happened there?) on a two hour and forty minute picture. But Scott does make American Gangster gain momentum as it goes along and reaches a powerhouse climax that is first intense and bloody (it IS Scott after all), followed by a striking human angle. And it holds nothing on Scarface, at the end of it all, as far as being legitimately dramatic without the ham, as the actors and director click for most part on material that just needs to be told without any pretension- and with that dose of significance of real urban crime in the 1970s in NYC.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"A strange but effective mix of ""movie gangster epic"" and The Wire which produces more strengths than weaknesses (but does produce both)","Having spent over a decade as Bumpy Johnson's driver, Frank Lucas looks to step up into the gap following his death. Looking to avoid the glitz and publicity of his peers, Lucas makes a connection in the Far East after seeing a news article on the abundance of drugs and its impact on US soldiers. Using military aircraft to transport the goods, Lucas enlists his family and trusted associates to put a cheaper but higher quality product onto the streets, quickly dominating the market  his low profile meaning he avoids the traps of dirty cops and investigations. Meanwhile clean, but deeply unpopular cop Richie Roberts is allowed to put together a small unit to look into the source of the new wave of drugs.I do like my crime dramas and it seemed obvious to me that I would enjoy American Gangster given the calibre of people involved in it and, watching it last night, I must say that I did find it a satisfying and enjoyable film. The pace is comparatively slow but yet the story comes over as packed  not busy to the point of being hustle and bustle but more just constantly engaging and interesting. Based on a true story, the film seems in no particular rush and I did respect this in the delivery as it allowed me room to be involved in the telling rather than it trying to constantly hold my attention with action or loud noises. Of course some viewers will feel the absence of these stimuli more than I did but for me it worked.I was surprised by how uncinematic it felt though. Considering the sweep and scale of the last Crowe/Scott film (Gladiator), American Gangster is remarkably absent of visual flair. As other reviewers have commented it did have the feel of an episode of The Wire in how ""matter of fact"" it was. Of course to me there can be no higher compliment than being compared to that HBO series and personally I had no problem with this approach despite it feeling a little odd on a large screen. The cast fill that same screen though and the film is deep in names all giving solid performances or better. Washington plays his character out well while Crowe contrasts with him nicely in individual and shared scenes. Neither has a lot in the way of character development beyond the obvious but the overall approach of the film made this less important than it otherwise would have been. Supporting these two are too many people to discuss within IMDb's word limit. Ejiofor, Brolin, Levine, Common, RZA, Gooding Jr, Assante, TI, Morton and of course The Wire's own Elba all turn in supporting roles among other faces; although it should be said that anyone enamoured with Elba's Stringer Bell as I am will be disappointed with his smaller, simpler character here. If anything the cast is almost too deep as it did distract at times to be constantly thinking ""that's the guy from etc"" but in terms of quality it is hard to really complaint.As I said I had no real problem with Scott's visual style and restrained ""factual"" delivery but in a way it could have done with learning some lessons from Scorsese. By this I specifically mean the use of music. The tracks are all great but they are not so much ""used"" as they are ""played"". Goodfellas is a great example of how to use music and somehow this film just did even try to compare  indeed even choosing some tracks that were only ever going to put the viewer in mind of another film (eg Across 110th Street from Jackie Brown). All told though I did appreciate the gritty and unflashy approach of the film as it did suit the manner of the telling.So a strange but effective mix then. In a way it carries itself like a classic gangster tale suggesting that it sits up there with Godfather and Goodfellas. But then in other ways it channels The Wire's ""matter of fact"" and unflashy style to deliver an engaging and convincing story that is well delivered by all. Somehow the mix works for the greater good even if it also produces some downsides to both. Not the perfect classic that some reviews would have you believe but certainly a solid and roundly strong product that is worth seeing for many reasons.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"excellent story, flawless performances","American Gangster is one of the best movies i've recently seen and it is a pleasure to watch even if you are not a gangster movies fan. The story is more captivating than i expected i must say, following Frank Lucas(Denzel Washington) - the afro-American drug lord who raised above all, even the Italian mafia - and Richie Roberts(Russel Crowe), the honest cop in a city full of corruption, sort of Frank Serpico but with less guts.Denzel Washington delivers a marvelous performance of a man calm and patient yet heart-stopping ferocious at some points, fearless and ambitious but likable as always. His performances are always incredible, he's a great actor, the greatest afro-American actor of all time i dare to say, it's simply a pleasure to watch him in any role.Russel Crowe delivers a good performance, he's one of the actors that never disappoint in my opinion and i think there's a great chemistry between them (Washington and Crowe) even though few scenes bring them face to face. Richie Roberts is in danger for being one of the few cops that actually do their jobs and refuse to take bribe so i think there's a big resemblance between Richie Roberts and Frank Serpico (Al Pacino 1973).Cuba Gooding Jr. could have gotten a bigger part, or more scenes because he's a very talented actor and he proved himself many times that he's more than capable of delivering excellent performances.The drama is less than expected but the movie is very well paced and it never gets boring even if it lasts more than two hours. Everything fits perfectly and there is an excellent antithetical presentation of the wealthy life of Frank Lucas opposite to the lives that he's drugs ruin every day, every hour, every minute...I strongly recommend to gangster movies fans, actually to those viewers who enjoy good movies because this movie is above average and you will enjoy every second of it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Excellent crime-drama,"Excellent crime-drama.The story of Frank Lucas, the man who built a massive drug empire largely from scratch, and Richie Roberts, the outcast cop who took him down. Shows Lucas' rise to power, through ingenuity, business sense and plain ruthlessness and how he managed to fly under the police's (and many other people's) radar for so long. Also shows how the cops eventually pinpointed him as the drug kingpin they were after, their investigations and how they eventually got him.Great storytelling from director Ridley Scott. He builds the details, and shows the history of the two protagonists, in parallel for a while. Then he builds the tension as everything comes together. In the end you have a great no-pretence, gritty, almost old-fashioned film noir gangster movie.Great work by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe in the lead roles. Good supporting cast too.On the negative side, there are a few sub-plots and scenes which seem unnecessary (eg the Cuba Gooding angle). In addition, there are some turns of events that seem implausible, especially towards the end (eg Roberts as both cop and prosecutor). This doesn't take too much away from quality of the movie though.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
The Black Godfather,"When I first saw the film, I didn't find it all that engaging, but by the time I got around to seeing the extended cut, I warmed up to it. It's a terrific crime film that accomplishes damn near everything it set out to do, and with an amazing cast of performers along with a stellar lead performance and riveting direction from director Ridley Scott (in top form here), it's one of the essential American crime movies of the past decade, drawing influence upon genre classics - such as Superfly, Goodfellas, and Black Caeser, while effortlessly carving its own identity. If you're not big on crime films, most of your enjoyment from this will be based on how much you like the cast and how familiar you are with their work, but one can't deny how well made and polished the film is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Keeps The Viewer Involved And Interested....Well Done.,"The story about Frank Lucas is one that proves fact is more interesting than fiction. The fact that such a character really did exist yet I do not remember it certainly intrigues me. I guess I was just too young at the time it broke. Now approaching my later forties finds me longing to research it further after seeing this movie.I get the feeling Ridley Scott was amazed a person such as Frank Lucas was actually able to do what he did and live to tell about it. I certainly share that amazement. The care in which he tells the story serves it well. Though it's basically a gangster movie it's not particularly graphic in violence except in a few scenes. Even Denzel's and Russel's portrayals of the two central characters are not quite as dark as the usual more stereotypical gangster/cop persona...Still there is a sense of doom and danger ever present as the viewer knows neither law enforcement, government, or mafia will let this man's drug empire go on.To sum it up I believe this is an excellent telling of a true crime story. It's intriguing, entertaining, and certainly serves as a cautionary reminder to remain vigilant in combating drugs.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Unoriginal Boring Disappointment,"American Gangster may be the most boring, unoriginal, flaccid film that Ridley Scott has yet to make.Coming from the man who created Alien, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, and Blade Runner, it boggles my mind as to why this film was not infused whatsoever with his signature style, pacing, and panache.This film tries so hard to be a sweeping epic crime saga, but in the end, cannot hold a candle to any Martin Scorsese work, for instance.American Gangster is dull. Its also boring, pointless, flat, limp, and completely cliché ridden.A combination of Serpico, Dead Presidents, Donnie Brasco, Goodfellas, Carlito's Way, and what have you... this film ends up being a mishmash, using mostly the boring parts of the aforementioned films.None of the characters of very engrossing, with Denzel Washington's character coming across as inauthentic and about as deep as a puddle of water in the Gobi.Interestingly enough, the film has no major glaring flaws, a testament to Ridley Scott's experience and craft. The script is acceptable, but lacking any style or idiosyncrasy and lacking any real depth. The story has no message, no meat - its just a random story; even having it based on real events gave it no gravitas. The acting is also acceptable, but lacking any bravado. Crowe is his likable credible self, showing flashes of energy - but unfortunately his character is nothing but a poor man's Frank Serpico. Denzel somehow totally misses the mark. His character is seriously underwritten, and Denzel gives us one note for almost 3 hours - and that is mostly of his now trademark ""self-righteous African American"". Despite being the ""bad guy"" in the film, Denzel does not give us a true villain. If the moral ground of this character is supposed to be grayed, giving us an anti-hero, its not. At least not sufficiently to give Denzel proper ammo to work with. What we get is a murderer and drug dealer, who is not such a bad guy because he buys a white man's mansion for his mother. Somebody please hold the bucket whilst I puke in it.... The rest of the supporting cast is also serviceable, but like the leads, lacks any true punch. One exception is Josh Brolin, who gives the one memorable turn as a crooked cop. The look of the film is interesting - a kind of grayish beige-ish wash out... as if you are looking at ""cleaned up"" 70's footage. However, like everything else in the film, the camerwork lacks the ballet and balls of Ballhaus or Richardson, for instance. Considering how Ridley Scott has taken the visuals of most his films to the limits, its a major disappointment that he decided to make the aesthetics of this film to be one dimensional.The generic title of this film should have been a red-flag that American Gangster was going to be a flat, cliché-d, overlong flaccid crime ""epic"", with no interesting visuals, a boring pointless story, and characters devoid of any interest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

A missed opportunity given the resources assembled,"A well-crafted film with great performances, but which lingers on the unimportant details and then strangely rushes the crux of the story. It's a bit like a Grandpa Simpson anecdote.

By the time the two main characters lives finally begin to converge, there's no time left to explore how and why their relationship develops the way it does--which is the really interesting part of the story.

Two Great Actors Elevate This Scarface-Like Story,"The best thing this movie had going for it - which is no surprise - is the acting duo of Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. How many bad movies do you see with either of those guys starring in them? Not many, and neither actor disappoints here. Both play fascinating guys, Washington, a big gangster (""Frank Lucas"") and Crowe, an honest cop (""Richie Roberts"")This movie reminded me a lot of the '83 ""Scarface"" film in which Tony Montana (Al Pacino) rises from the bottom up to be a big drug lord, only to have things crumble big-time. We see a similar tale here with ""Lucas,"" except that his fall is sudden in this story, unlike Pacino's character.Director Ridley Scott and photographer Harris Savides also give us a slick- looking film, very pretty spots and stylishly-directed.The story wasn't quite as good as the people who photographed it and acted in it. It's still a good one in that it entertains. I was never bored despite the two- and-a-half-hour length of it. I was a bit confused in the first 25 minutes but things straightened out after that.The supporting cast in here is very deep with a lot of familiar faces, going all the way back to 83-year-old Ruby Dee. A new, young face - Lamari Nadal - is a real beauty. She plays Frank's wife, who is a lot nicer character than the one Michelle Peiffer played in ""Scarface.""A key to whether you enjoy this or not - if you haven't seen it - might be your expectations. Know in advance there is not a ton of action in this tough crime movie and don't listen to all the hype that this is ""the best film of the year.""

Conventional yet compelling crime drama,"Certain films appear almost tailor made for success right from the moment of conception, and American Gangster proves a perfect example. Detailing the thrilling true story of a Harlem drug lord, helmed by an enormously renowned director and giving two of the finest stars in the industry the chance to generate murderous chemistry and flex their dramatic muscles, it seemed near impossible that the film could not be a runaway smash hit. And indeed it would seem this was the attitude of those involved with the production of the film, as while the film in question is hardly a failure, the impression is given of all concerned being content to coast by on the film's respective successful components instead of really pushing the envelope to extract every ounce of the film's cinematic potential. As such, American Gangster remains an engrossing and powerful piece of cinema but considering the movie magic that could have resulted, the sturdy film feels almost like a disappointment, or at the very least a somewhat misplaced opportunity.As laudable a package as American Gangster is, the inescapable sense of it offering little of new to the crime genre and in many cases unabashedly borrowing from past efforts (one scene in particular is purloined directly from The Godfather) stifles one's appreciation of its overall quality. Had the film been released twenty or so years ago, it would doubtlessly have been praised for its storyline and thematic innovations, but after countless entries into the genre of late, characteristics such as repeatedly drawing explicit parallels and contrasts between the cop and criminal squaring off against each other and police corruption making it difficult for the one honest member to function hardly come across as revelatory. While it is clear that all parties involved have done more than their fair share of research into the life and legacy of infamous 1970s Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas, the telling of Lucas' tale falls prey to overly familiar crime film conventions so frequently that there is little to differentiate the film from countless other explorations of the rise and fall of successful drug lords apart from the nationality of the title character, proudly flaunted ""true story"" tag or not.However, quality is quality, and in the hands of such an esteemed filmmaker as Ridley Scott it proves a difficult trait to avoid indeed, as Scott anchors a firm directorial grasp throughout. After a slow start, detailing Lucas' work ethic and value system, Scott's film really takes off, with the veteran director extracting the maximum possible amount of tension, cinematic power and emotional clout from the compelling story, convention aside. Scott's depiction of 1970s Harlem indeed looks and feels the part, painting a vivid and memorable picture of the highs and lows of financial offerings, albeit one that does feel like an immaculate construction without the level of grit or authenticity other filmmakers such as Scorsese have pumped from the much filmed city. However, with some quality cinematography and editing and a suitably seventies musical score the film remains an overall staunchly constructed package, despite the feeling of it being very much a package and less of a flowing story.As title character Frank Lucas, Denzel Washington is truly the film's main centerpoint of quality, his quiet charisma and nobility creating a character who audiences can empathise with while simultaneously being repelled by without missing a beat. Rather than struggling with the differentiation, Washington inhabits the character so fully that such contradictions appear second nature, fully engrained in such an able-bodied performance. Russell Crowe is also a strong presence as Richie Roberts, the struggling, scruffy policeman striving to take Lucas down, but despite Crowe's trademark rugged charisma his performance still appears bland by his usual standards, coasting by on a simplistically written ""struggling, divorced but honest cop"" archetype. Ably backing the two powerhouse leads, Chiwetel Ejoifor wonderfully essays Lucas' nervy yet enthusiastically likable brother and second in command, and Josh Brolin gives a gleefully repulsive performance as a seedy, corrupt policeman. Ruby Dee shines in her few scenes, a dignified yet formidable performance as Lucas' weathered mother, and Lymari Nadal instils a quiet serenity into Lucas' beauty queen wife, preventing the character from simply becoming an undignified moll.While American Gangster boasts impressive exteriors, on the inside it proves somewhat of a hollow effort, offering little new to its genre and seemingly lacking in genuine spark underneath the awards baiting outside. However, the quality on display cannot be ignored, and the film remains an impressively crafted, powerfully acted and undeniably compelling piece of work - if only there wasn't an ever persistent sense of missed potential throughout, an even greater film lingering frustratingly out of reach.-7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Nearly as good as the best of Scorsese,"A tough, exquisitely-made gangster film redolent of Martin Scorsese at his best. Ridley Scott has pulled out all the stops here, making this one of his greatest ever films; if I had to choose a top form, this film would be in the list (alongside ALIEN, BLACK HAWK DOWN and GLADIATOR). American Gangster feels like an epic, a fully rounded, completely engrossing true story of one man's rise to the top in the drug trade.Denzel Washington has long since proved his acting chops and it's no surprise that he's on top form here as Frank Lucas, an extremely ruthless henchman who decides to go into business on his own. Despite the lengthy running time and the decades-long scope of the film's narrative, what follows is never less than fully engaging. Scott is on top form as director, this film is a beauty to watch, and the various montage scenes are particularly well handled.Playing opposite Washington is Scott regular Russell Crowe as a scruffy but dedicated cop determined to bring down his man. Crowe goes for the subtle approach, never overshadowing Washington, and he's very effective with it. The supporting cast are excellent, particularly Josh Brolin as a corrupt cop. Despite the familiarity of its format and the inevitability of its outcome, American Gangster is a film that holds its own against the other all-time American gangster greats like GOODFELLAS and CASINO.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great Talent/Good Movie,"A great story, a great director, and a great actor came together, and ultimately made a good movie. With all of these ingredients, it would be hard to fail, and they certainly didn't fail. But the problem with this movie is that it wasn't edgy enough. Denzel did a fine job, but he didn't come across as a cold blooded killer. Denzel is a pretty serious guy and he brought that seriousness to the role of Frank Lucas. But I didn't see any homicidal undertones in his performance, the way I saw it with Al Pacino when he played Tony Montana. That guy was a true nutcase. Denzel was just a little too polished, though it worked fine. The same can be said with Ridley Scott's directing. He made a lot of good choices, but again, something was missing. I would have liked to see him take a few chances or do something a little more drastic to capture the drama. But these criticisms aside, American Gangster is definitely a well-made movie that is worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Very Impressive Cast and Perfect Character Development,","American Gangster is a fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline and a very talented cast.Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe both matched their characters perfectly,which I was surprised with because they both didn't seem like characters they were use to playing,it also was a very different movie for Ridley Scott,and he did a very impressive job with it.The character development in this movie is practically perfect,you mostly follow Russel Crowe and Denzel Washington's characters,and I didn't feel like they left out a lot of information and really took their time letting use get to know these characters.I would highly recommend American Gangster to all fans of gangster crime films.Set during the seventies,Richie Roberts (Russel Crowe) will stop at nothing to bring down the massive drug business of the dangerous and highly wanted Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington).",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great for what's there; too bad about what's missing,"The most outstanding element of this film isn't the story or the acting -- it is the production values. It is almost as if Ridley Scott has reconstructed NYC of the 1970s or traveled back in time. The story is interesting, and it follows history pretty accurately -- at least more accurately than many ""based on a true story"" movies. But, as many other users have noted, the movie doesn't take full advantage of the dual story threads -- the relationship between the gangster and the cop should have received more time at the end, and there are many minutes of film in the first half that could have been cut to make that possible.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Immensely Satisfying Crime Film,"Movies like these can't work without the right cast. I mean, I shouldn't even have to say that. It's a rule. There are plenty of different kinds of movies that can get by on style, visuals, or action all on their own. But what separates a movie like ""Gangster Squad"" from a movie like ""American Gangster"" is the cast, and how the cast is used. It has to be both.There are lots of familiar faces in this film. On top of Washington and Crowe, you have Chiwetel Ejiofor, Idris Elba and Josh Brolin. The director is Ridley Scott, a man who knows how to helm ambitious projects, like ""Black Hawk Down"", ""Gladiator"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"". The pieces are all there.One of ""American Gangster""'s biggest strengths is that there is a rich cast of characters, but the viewer is never lost, because the focus is primarily on Denzel Washington's Frank Lucas, and Russell Crowe's Richie Roberts. They carry the film, as they certainly should.The plot is centred around a lengthy crusade by Roberts and his team to get to the bottom of New York's biggest drug conspiracy, which is of course being controlled by Lucas. This is a major theme regarding Lucas; he likes to be in control, to be able to gun down a man he doesn't like in the middle of a crowded sidewalk without any consequences. As a result, this makes his character seem all the more vulnerable when he isn't in total control of his situation.At the same time, Roberts is fighting more than just drug crime. He isn't the most honest guy, but he just might be the most honest cop. He is repulsed by crooked cops, and as a result he estranges himself from most of his workplace kin. So, as he fights to nail down the source of the drugs, he is also fighting against everyone who considered him a ""boy scout"" whenever he did what he felt was right.Everything comes together in a conclusion that rewards anyone who takes the time to savour every moment of the film's 160 minutes. I rank this among the finest crime dramas I've watched.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
American Film Take a Bow...,"One of the best anti-hero's in film history..Frank is a drug dealer who we learn to empathise with due to the fact that there are darker corruptible sharks around him in both the criminal underbelly and law enforcement that make him look reasonable. A genius plot device that might not have been intended but creates a fantastic piece of story telling.The casting is perfect all round and Denzel shines yet again.Every scene drives the story forward and this is why you don't realise it goes for two hours. Studios don't let screenplays go this long so you know it's a great piece of writing.The moral message is self contained and comes out in dribs and drabs across the entire production. We see both the long arc of justice and quick vengeance which come to a head for many characters who stir emotion in us quickly. One is a prideful stand-over man trying to fill a power vacuum after Bumpy Johnson's death and another is a wife beater. Both great tropes to illicit emotion.A true to life cultural setting and historical war backdrop that provides some gorgeous cinematography. The only thing missing is the development of the love story subplot but there's just not enough room for it.The slow burn of anticipation results in a crescendo of drama rather than action which is just a bonus that features in every act break.True stories are the best stories, but sometimes you get lucky with stars that align across a production. Directors will tell you during shooting and editing, that you just never know how it's going to churn out, and nobody could have expected a master piece like this.No political correctness, no diversity quotas, no genre mashes, no fancy log line just a legacy piece of art that we should be paying an unfair 'twenty percent' on.Bravo.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Outstanding.,"I never met anyone who said any single bad thing about this movie, and if someone is not delusional he simply can't say anything wrong about it. Denzel has proved once more why he is the man to choose when giving big roles, and his portraying of Frank Lucas makes every next person in day life calling himself ""Gangster"" absurd and childish, while Russell as addition of dedicating himself to provide justice is 0% cliché and pure genius. Production shows the grittiness of 70s perfectly, and tense atmosphere around plot just make you want to forget everything you saw at the end, so you can see it again and again, because movies like this are pure rarity. Sensational.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
American Gangstter A Good But Overlong Action Crime Drama,"American Gangster is a good but overlong action crime drama with solid performances by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe as the two leads. They both continue to show their talent as actors in these movie despite it's flaws. Director Ridley Scott is admirable in making this film based on a true story about Frank Lucas a heroine drug kingpin from Manhattan and Richie Roberts a dedicated detective determined to bring him down. Washington and Crowe don't share a lot of the screen time together but when they do both actors make the best of it. Well done. The rest of the cast including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Josh Brolin, Cuba Gooding Jr., Carla Gugino, Ted Levine, Joe Morton, Armand Assante, Common, and Idris Elba are effective as the supporting characters in their very limited screen time. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles as well. The film may be a little light on action except for some but it does have some character development, drama, some humor, and a little suspense but not much. What weighed down the film the most to me was the running time of 157 minutes. It had a slow pace at times making the movie feel long because dragged in some areas. Despite some flaws though American Gangter isn't that bad of a movie I've seen worse (The Spirit, Elektra, and The Wicker Man to name a few). Overall if you can get past the long running time first this film based on a true story is worth watching at least once mainly because of the exceptional performances by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Nice to see a different kind of gangster film....,"One in which it isn't about the Italian or Russian mob. The gangsters here are American born and run Harlem. Headman Bumpy Johnson dies and his driver, Frank Lucas, decides its his time to take over the business. Frank's getting squeezed by local players and decides he must do something to get more of the dope market and to be the top dog. There are reports that soldiers in Vietnam are becoming addicted to heroin because of its cheap price and easy access. Frank goes over there and uses some connections and makes a deal to ship pure heroin using Army planes back to the US for distribution. Before long he has control over the dope market in New York and is top dog. He even shoots someone on the sidewalk in front of many people to prove he's not afraid and to put fear in the commoner.Russell Crowe plays the cop whom is assigned to form a drug force to take down big players in New York. His investigation leads to once unknown Frank as being the big supplier.So, the latter part of the film is the police investigation into Frank and how the dirty cops play into it all. The film also shows us some of Frank's personal life with his mom and wife. And it's all very entertaining. The film is long at over 2 and a half hours, but it seemed to fly by. That's the mark of a good film.FINAL VERDICT: I'm a big fan of Russell Crowe and he doesn't disappoint here. He's good in this as well as Denzel. The film is one of the best of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Still kind of a letdown, considering all the hype","How do I put this? American Gangster is good enough of a movie to distract you from the questions you'll find yourself asking about the plot, for a while at least. The movie is very well acted - Denzel and Crowe don't disappoint. They are, however, showing their age. Neither have the chiseled face bones, and Denzel looks like he has man-boobs in one scene when he has a wifebeater on. Not that this detracts from the movie in any way. Just don't expect Crowe to look like he did in Gladiator, though. I won't go through all the nice points because I was expecting it to be good (and it was), but I will talk about my biggest concern.Getting past all the badassery Frank commits, we never get a clear picture of who Frank (Washington's character) is. He's charming in front of his family, and then all of a sudden he's bashing people's heads in the middle of a dinner party with his family members around. He plays with Crowe's character in one scene, then abruptly capitulates to him in the next (even though he says something to the effect of never giving up earlier in the movie). He lets his nephew, get involved in his dealings instead of telling him 'no', but hands out turkeys to the public. Sometimes an unpredictable/double sided character is good, but not here; when the poop hits the fan, so to speak, the audience has absolutely no idea what Frank is going to do because we are still not really sure which kind of person his really is deep down. I somehow expected this to dawn on me, but the ending happened before I could figure it out. I also wasn't sure if I should be rooting for Frank at the end. I mean, everybody roots for Denzel (even in Training Day, right?) because he's Denzel, and that kind of complicates things.Expect a lengthy (in a good way) movie with an abrupt ending that has you wondering what the hell his family thinks of him now (I don't want to ruin the ending, so I won't say more than this). Also, don't expect as much action as is hinted at in the trailer. This isn't a gun-toting shoot-em-up, and the Italians mentioned in the trailer aren't starting a turf war or anything.I did really like how the last scene was shot, though. Overall, if I were to set it up in one sentence, I would say that American Gangster is a great movie with a somewhat flawed ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A surprisingly involving gangster film,"Ridley Scott is an amazing director but going into American Gangster I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised.The story is intriguing and doesn't drag in any places plus the acting was topnotch. Some people seemed to be disappointed by finding less action than they were hoping for but I didn't mind. The film didn't drag on and the story was interesting so who cares if there aren't explosions in every scene?Denzel is brilliant as drug lord Frank Lucas and Crowe plays Richie Roberts, the one honest cop in a city full of corruption, perfectly. The film is well paced and doesn't drag on even though it lasts for more than two hours.Altogether its a good gangster that, though not entirely original as far as story and theme go, still manages to be entertaining and intriguing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
It's crazy how much I love this film. Defiantly one of the best.,"American Gangster is based in 1970s America. A detective works to bring down the drug empire of Frank Lucas, a heroin kingpin from Manhattan, who is smuggling the drug into the country from the Far East. I saw this film hanging around and I was like ""I might as well"". That is probably one of the best choices I have ever made. The acting was magnificent from Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe to Chiwetel Ejiofor (the guy from 2012. Yeah, we'll forgive him) and Ruby Dee. I loved the conflict between both Denzel Wahington's character and Russell Crowe's character because it is so unique in the way they interact with each other even though they are on separate sides of the law. Denzel' Washington's character was my favorite. He is a genius and he is one of those characters that doesn't really like what he is doing but does it to better his family. I makes it hard to think he is a bad guy even though he is a bad guy. When you like the bad guy, you know you've done a good job (Heath Ledger's joker, Geoffery Rush's Captain Barbosa, Tom Cruise's Vincent in Collateral). Now, because it is a gangster film, naturally, you compare it to other gangster film's and I defiantly it is one of the best because of it's presence, writing, acting and Ridley Scott's amazing directing. To be honest, I found it more entertaining then The Godfather. That's right I said it. The music as well is brilliant. It makes it easier to immerse yourself into the era. Loved every second of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Extended version is the way to go,"I've now seen both long and short versions. Yes the extended version adds filler, but with these story driven films, time and structure is critical. I believe the extended version is more epic and offers more to the audience. This is a film in the style of The Godfather and a longer running time for the characters was worthwhile. I've increased from 7 to 9 as it's still not a grand storytelling. This is still a great film, and if you haven't seen it or have only seen the cinema cut, the extended is my recommendation. Ridley Scott tends to be a filmmaker that has embraced the home market for extended or director's cut versions.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

I mean I have love Carla Gugino, since I first seen her in the Bon Jovi video for Always, but the Roberts divorce subplot could have been cut, as just one example.

Masterpiece,"9.5 stars of 10. Most Film Historians consider American Gangster to be a Masterpiece. No argument here, I agree. It's a truly great piece of filmed cinema.It stars Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, alongside Chiwetel Ejofor. Ejofor is such a capable Performer and he does fantastic in this role. The supporting cast also does very well in their smaller but important roles, and a strong supporting cast it is, including: Cuba Gooding Jr., Josh Brolin, Clarence Williams III, Ted Levine, Roger Guenveur Smith, Armand Assante, Ruby Dee, John Ortiz, Idris Elba, John Hawkes, Carla Gugino, to name some of them. Well done.Russell Crowe is great, as he almost always is, just an absolute commanding and believable Performamce by him. He amazes me in many Films, including this Film.I'll get to Denzel Washington later. All of these Performances are captured brilliantly by its Director, Ridley Scott. He's such an amazing and influential Director. He has had such a great career, Directing such Masterpiece Films like The Duellists (1977), Alien (1979), Blade Runner (1982), Thelma & Louise (1991), Gladiator (2000), Black Hawk Down (2001), The Martian (2015), The Last Duel (2021), just to name a handful. It shouldn't surprise anyone that a truly legendary and great Director like Ridley Scott would have a part in capturing these Performances & help make this Film a Masterpiece, he's absolutely fantastic, what a career!Then of course there's Denzel Washington. Denzel brings a very dynamic and believable Performance with seemingly impossible intricacies. This role calls for Denzel to Perform at various levels of intensity & dynamics, from subdued subtleties to intricate intensities; he does them all with balance and skill, seemingly naturally and believably.Every generation, if we're lucky, a talent like Denzel Washington comes along, an emotionally dynamic completely believable Performer.I think Denzel is one of the 10 best Actor's in history. It's an impossible list as there are 50 I want to have in my Top 10; but I would say these are the 10 best Actors in history (listed in order from oldest to newest):Charlie Chaplin, Robert De Niro, Denzel Washington, Daniel Day-Lewis, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Joaquin Phoenix, Leonardo DiCaprio, Philip Seymour Hoffman & Shia LaBeouf.Most Film Historians would say that Denzel Washington has starred in 15-20 Masterpieces thus far during his career. I believe if I talked to the 100 most respected Film Historians around the World, naturally they would all have slightly different lists, but I believe if they came to a consensus, this would be Historians Top 10:1. Glory (1989) 2. Much Ado About Nothing (1993) 3. Malcolm X (1992) 4. The Tragedy Of Macbeth (2021) 5. Inside Man (2006) 6. American Gangster (2007) 7. The Hurricane (1999) 8. Fences (2016) 9.

It was indeed intricate in some areas and did not lose my full attention to the words spoken.

Malcolm X Done Right,"This film went through hell on its way to the screen. It was fondled, butchered, divorced and remarried, sunk, then revived. Along the way, the story evolved from a one story to several, only loosely connected as the studio tried to cover all bases.Scott hired on basically to keep working. its one of his lesser projects, like ""Hannibal,"" where he follows the script fed by others. But still, he has a cinematic style that makes this worth watching if you love visual poetry. In fact, you can watch this with no sound whatever and possibly enjoy it more. That's because Scott designs his shots and shaves his editing so that (almost) each shot anticipates the next. Its unique in modern film-making, and when he goes, this style will probably die. ""Gladiator"" was the height of this, and Crowe understands what he has to do to feed it. He's not there much, but the sequence where the raid on the drug lab is so ""in the future"" it will be a film school staple for decades.Washington doesn't get this end of film-making. He was inherited from an earlier incarnation of the film. So instead of being inside the film, he's placed outside. He's not the story, but what the story uses to tell itself. Its a subtle distinction -- and Washington's cluelessness as an actor is used against him -- but it makes the thing a bit more coherent to consider his character as simply shaped by the forces around him. Washington has such a narrow range, I couldn't help compare this to Spike Lee's picture. Spike goes for the story as it appears in the actors. He discovers it and captures it in bits. He doesn't compose a movie; its coherence comes from found characters. So his pictures have no cinematic soul, and give the illusion of finding reality. That can work when he actually finds life, which is rare. He didn't in ""X"" so the choppy nature of that arc stands in contrast to the energetic action of time this has.Scott also likes to designate watchers, even if not written in the script. See how he manages to photograph the two wives in such a way that they are internal surrogates for us?The one thing that annoys is those labels to tell us where were we are, Thailand, Brooklyn, Fort Bragg and so on. This is just cinematic laziness. Scott could easily have shown us where we were, and in fact does some of the time. Studios again, I suppose.Yes, it references films of the period, specifically gangster and blaxsploitation. But that's almost trite by now.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Gangster themes revisited with style and violence--a strong if familiar vein,"American Gangster (2007)Almost by design, this movie starts off filled with mobster clichés. The idea is to set up a world that we are well acquainted with from earlier classics like ""The Godfather,"" and we see power, ruthlessness, loyalty, money, and ambition quickly mixed together. The clichés are almost boring (not that Denzel Washington is ever boring)—the gangster is charming and clever, the cop is dedicated to his job and his wife is leaving him, and all the minions and hangers-on are as they should be, colorful and secondary.So it almost ends up being just another gangster movie, this one being about a black godfather. But ""American Gangster"" then adds some new elements, including some brief scenes set in Thailand and a long coda at the end where the cops and the criminal cooperate. I won't give too much away there.All of it is filmed well, edited with clarity, and acted in a straight up realistic manner. For director Ridley Scott these are almost backhanded compliments. You might expect more. In fact, as much as the grows on you as it goes, and gets more colorful and complex, it remains really conventional as a movie. It's smart enough and slick enough to work, but it doesn't rise above—and it had the ingredients to rise very much above.In addition to Washington there is a really stunning (if clichéd) cop performance by Russell Crowe. And mixed into the large supporting cast are some stunning talents. Washington's mother is played with intensity by Ruby Dee (who I know best in Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"") and Armand Assante is a convincing old mob type in the Brando vein.Mostly it's Washington's movie. He's the title character, and he plays it mostly cool and charming, flashing his smile and running his efficient and risky business with confidence. There are lessons in the story about going it alone (no middlemen, for example), about family in crime (Italian style and African-American style), and about the limits of family loyalty (drugs and money are powerful temptations).There are also hints of the mayhem of the times—the late 60s and early 70s. Vietnam forms a vague but constant backdrop (not civil rights protests, oddly). And drug use is of course an important theme in the movie, though without particular judgement. People who have died using it are shown to be reckless types to start with (I'm abbreviating). One could easily say that the dire, evil, selfish, murderous aspects of being a drug king are glosses over—hinted at for sure but shown with those some old clichés the movie uses throughout, which has the feeling of acceptance.A really good movie. It's not one bit original, but in a way that's the point. This is the story of an extraordinary rise by one black man in the heat of the late 1960s to a position of unrivaled power and wealth. It's told with precision and familiarity and a certain amount of artful competence that makes it really feel solid and significant.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Mafia movies just hit when set in NYC.,"A gritty crime-drama based on a true story, set during one of the most notorious crime periods for New York City. Ridley Scott continues to prove there is not a sub-genre in existence that he is unable to direct expertly, but it definitely helps having one of the most talented leading men of the generation, Denzel Washington, starring as Frank Lucas.Russell Crowe's acting skill set works well in Scott's films, this time as Detective Richie Roberts. Denzel and Russell have great-screen chemistry with each other as well as with the rest of the eclectic cast. It is a more contemporary NYC mafia movie that holds its own against similar great films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Good, but not as brilliant as some would have us believe...","Ridley Scott's crime opus is a real slow-burner that starts a little shakily as it struggles to introduce the central characters in a way that doesn't confuse the viewer, and proceeds to tell its epic story at a stately pace that defies both genre conventions and present-day trends. There is no doubting the quality of the product here, there's no doubting the fact that it is a relatively big and important film, and yet there's still that nagging feeling that it isn't really as good as it could have beenDenzel Washington wins more screen time than co-star Russell Crowe and quite frankly acts Crowe off the screen. Ten years in the States and Crowe still has trouble concealing that antipodean twang when he's playing an American. While Crowe fights against his accent, Washington fights against his nice guy persona. Presumably he was chosen for this role because of that charisma  it adds depth to a bad guy when he's also a nice guy  but for some reason he just doesn't convince as this urbane businessman capable of shocking acts of brutality; his dark side simply fails to convince, and his violent outbursts too often seem too much at odds with his usual calm demeanour.Despite these niggles, as you would expect , the film is extremely well made. Scott could make a decent film out of the shoddiest of material, and with a cast like this one you just know you're in for some quality performances. Certainly, the acting and visual style outshine the plot which  despite being based on true events  is straight out of the Warner Bros. Big Book of Gangster Stories © 1937. We are never in any doubt as to how the film will end, and it is to Scott's and writer Steven Zaillian's credit that we're still willing to stick with it to the end credits anyway.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
What a boring treatment of the story of Frank Lucas,"After seeing the film I was curious about Frank Lucas and read the ""New York"" magazine article written about him in 2000. That article fleshed out a much more interesting biography about Mr. Lucas.I wonder why the producing powers that be decided to make ""American Gangster"" such a boring, toothless cop-chases-gangster film?! And Denzel Washington seemed like a poor fit for the role of Mr. Lucas....too polished for a decidedly rough-around-the-edges narcotics kingpin.Ugh. Waste of money. Go read the ""New York"" article for a more vivid gangster story.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
An excellent gangster film with a wide range of good actors.,"This film is based on the real life of the mobster Frank Lucas, who imposed himself on the drug trade in New York during the 1960s and 1970s before he was caught by the authorities and forced to collaborate with them in exchange for a considerable reduction in his sentence. The script shows how Lucas, initially a hand-man of the mobster Bumpy Johnson, manages to take advantage of his relations in the Far East and the Vietnam War to import, directly and without any intermediary, pure heroin into the United States, which goes on selling at a lower price than the competitors. The film also shows the efforts of an honest policeman, Richie Roberts, to fight organized crime and, at the same time, stay away from the corruption schemes in which almost all New York Police were involved then.The film is excellent for those who, like me, like films involving mobsters and the like. It's not a classic, but it works wonderfully. It begins slowly, with the death of Bumpy and the hypocrisy of society, which is massively rushing to the funeral despite being a criminal and a murderer. The pace is a little slow and its long length (almost three hours, in the extended version, which I saw) can intimidate some viewers, but the story develops well, gradually involving the audience. It is well worth spending some extra time on this film and seeing it as it deserves to be seen.Ridley Scott is a director who needs no introduction and who has previously shown us that he is a man of talent and that he knows how to get the best out of what he is given to work. Therefore, I am not surprised that the director here shows how to deal with the actors. The cast is full of noble names in the industry, starting with Denzel Washington, who offers us a great and committed work. I am not able to say that it is the best of this actor, because he is very regular in his work and offers us, almost always, good works, but it is really good to see him here in another great role. Russell Crowe also shines in this film, giving his character an air of rebelliousness, unblemished and irreducible. The list of notable names in the supporting roles is extensive, but I can say that I enjoyed Josh Brolin's work as one of the corrupt cops, Chiwetel Ejiofor and T. I. as mobsters. And although the film is very masculine, both in the theme and the cast, I would like to highlight the good performances of Ruby Dee and Lymari Nadal, in very interesting female characters.Technically, it is a contained film, which favors realism over the spectacle. There is not much action and the one that exists was very well done, without spectacularity or excessive noise. Cinematography is very pleasant, with good contrast and excellent use of light. Visually, it somewhat resembles the great gangster epics, and I have no doubt that Scott was influenced by Scorsese's style. The sets and costumes are excellent, with very interesting notes that take us back to the period when everything is happening (for example, TV news and some cars). I especially liked the elegant costumes reserved for Washington. The soundtrack, discreetly, contributes a lot to the environment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Uncut version - worth the watch,"The uncut version is nearly 3 hours long - which makes it about 20 mins longer than the theatre release version. The added scenes are certainly not detrimental to the film - if anything it adds even more depth and character to it. American Gangster is very much similar to Godfather with the difference that this movie is based on a true story. And you might be forgiven to think that this one looks more fictional than most gangster movies. The scams, double crossing, shooting people in the head in the middle of a street in new york, the impotency of the police in front of the obvious, the level of corruption in all spheres of the society and the widespread epidemic of drug abuse in new york, are simply astonishing. The historical aspect is very accurate as well. Ridley Scot does a great job by keeping the balance right - make it frantic and fast paced or follow the melodramatic line of the godfather? He has indeed found the right balance. But what he has achieved more prominently is immerse us into the 60's era of new york. There are a few allusions to the difficulty of a black man toppling the Italian mafia in those days; but I felt that maybe that aspect could have been developed further. This movie is a very very good watch - not lesson in cinema, as who would want to beat the godfathers in gangster movie - but this less fictional movie however is not very far away.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
excellent film by Ridley Scott,"""American Gangster"" from 2007 purports to be the story of drug lord Frank Lucas. My understanding is that it's about 1 percent accurate. However, the film, though long, is an excellent study of pervasive corruption.The cast includes Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Josh Brolin, Ruby Dee, and Ted Levine (from Monk).Washington plays Frank Lucas, a criminal who is determined to make it big in the drug trade. He flies to Thailand and arranges to have 100% heroin shipped to him, cutting out the middleman, and also putting the Mafia out of business. He calls the heroin ""Blue Magic.""He brings his family up from the south and has them working for him in various fronts - auto shop, dry cleaner, etc., but what they're doing is selling heroin.There is some discrepancy about how the heroin was shipped. In the film, it is as Lucas himself said, false bottoms in the coffins of dead soldiers. But someone else said it was in furniture.Lucas has so many cops on the take -- he's involved three-quarters of the narcotics squad, the main cop being Detective Trupo (Brolin), a real greedy guts.In the beginning of the film, we see the rise of Lucas and on the other side, how a special force was assembled to stop the sale of a drug called Blue Magic, which is Lucas' drug. The lead officer is Richie Roberts, who, with his partner, found $1 million in a drug bust.When Roberts wants to turn the money over to the evidence room, his partner tells him that if he does that, no one will work with him - they'll think he can't be trusted and will report them. Unreal. But Richie turns in the money and is given the management of the new force and told to choose only people he can trust. Roberts ultimately passed the bar exam and became an attorney.The real Roberts criticized Washington's portrayal of Lucas, saying he came off as ""almost noble."" Not to me he didn't. Roberts says that he was vicious, violent, illiterate. It's true that Washington did not play Lucas as illiterate. But in depicting his violence and viciousness, not acting overtly violent works better on film. Washington throughout seems reserved, somewhat soft-spoken, so that when he loses his temper, it's terrifying.Though long, ""American Gangster"" doesn't really feel long and is an absorbing film with interesting character studies. Dirty, corrupt cops are all over TV and movies. I have a feeling they may be all over our police departments too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Very entertaining, even if it does nothing new.","well Crowe and Scott are back again which is not a bad thing although i think they might be getting a little to comfortable with each other, but I'm getting ahead of myself lets break it down.let me sum this up for 2 people1. the people who have seen films like French connection, new jack city, godfather and the endless lines of clones you will basically be seeing the French connection/ new jack city, even though those films were taking story elements from the real frank Lucas' career you cant help but see the similarities and the film becomes a lesser film because of it2. those who haven't seen anything about mobsters or cops trying to take down mobsters before, well than this is a 9/10 10 out of ten for you unless your a smart person then the story itself will bring it to a 8 or 7/10story: 1/3 of this is really entertains too much is going on way too much between Russell's custody of his kid, (who we see once and are supposed to feel for) and power struggles between Mr. Washington's country boy brothers who are new to the flashy take whats yours life style that frank has and his brothers (who we also touch on for only a second) and Mr. Washington wife coming to terms with her husbands dealings (should of scraped that story all together along with Russell's kid)the story itself you've seen it before many many times. its a simple retelling of much better films, but its told very well with as always a fully realized view of the world that Scott is showing you. Everything is muted and full of dark grays, in Russell's world it has that great new jersey bleakness to it and in Mr. Washington's world although more violent is altogether more vibrant and also darker at the same time. The look of this film itself is a 10/10. there is a great film in here somewhere and had it been a 3 1/2 hour epic film it would be winning awards across the table, but alas its a 2+ hour semi-epic trying to break free from the confines of a self contained studio film. from the beginning i thought this was a fiction tale but of course, it is based on a true story and it is a very good one. i wish they had spent more time on just how does one black man in that era build this empire, now that is a story that hasn't been touched on enough but ultimately it shows how he gets his one connection: he gets the house and the other usual rap song trimmings and then comes the regularly scheduled love interest, who is given nothing to do. i could care less about her she apparently doesn't care what frank does as long as she gets fur coats but we've sen that overused plot device for years now and frankly I'm sick of it id rather frank be gay so at least it be something differentafter a killer start an OK middle and a by the motions 3rd act i was left wondering and hoping that there is, a as always a Mr.Scott directors cut out there with the hour and a half of character development that is sorely neededacting; as i said before i think Scott and Russell are getting to comfortable with each other Russell's performance is strange he supposed to be a bumbling civil servant who turns hard ass throughout the movie, but something about it just doesn't work for me. at times he seems too relaxed but ultimately the character itself is under-developedas for Mr. Washington the man can do no wrong in my eyes, he really makes this film. As we already know its fun as hell to watch him play the bad guy and you can tell hes having a lot of fun with it too, i only wish we saw more of him being really ruthless but instead we just get the usual initial set-up to his being a bad ass. But its damn fun to watch.bottom line: there are much better films on this subject most of them can be found from 70's. unless you are not a big film goer then settle in and watch a very entertaining film even if it does nothing new.p.s. i don't know who fixed up this comment section for i.m.d.b. but if i cant use the actors name what good is it. thats why i had to use Mr. Washington and Russell because i.m.d.b. does not recognize Mr. Washington's first name Mr. Scott's first or Russell's last.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
The movie falls flat...you want it to be more than it is,"When you put two of the best actors of the past 25 years on screen together you expect to be riveted. I can actually say that neither had memorable performances. I'd go as far as to say it felt like both were going through the motions here. I saw this with a buddy and we both walked out feeling the same way..entirely underwhelmed. I couldn't identify one scene...NOT ONE....where I sat there and said ""That's why Denzel and Crowe are who they are....there is their genius at work"".The movie is awfully slow at times and actually bores you with the amount of details given. The first hour is terribly un-engaging. There is nothing you see here that you haven't seen in Godfather, Goodfellas, New Jack City, Blow, Scarface, etc. It's basically all of those movies put together, but without any memorable scenes.I'm sure some will talk about the violence scenes where Denzel has his fits of rage. I didn't find those moments overly believable or interesting. And what more is there to the movie in terms of powerful moments besides those? Even if those scenes did do it for you, unlike me, was there any other moments actually compelling where you say ""Wow....that was amazing"".I was telling people before I saw this movie that I thought even the trailer seemed pretty flat...I wasn't excited to see this because the trailer did little for me, but I hoped that it was merely a case of not wanting to give away the good stuff. In reality, there wasn't any ""good stuff"".I found all of the characters to be either one dimensional or cliché. I'll give the movie a 6 because it's not a ""bad"" movie by any means. It just falls way short of being what it wanted to be. When you look back at Crowe and Denzel's career, I wouldn't come close to mentioning this movie as one of their finest pieces of work.Not to try to compare apples to oranges, but the story-telling, the acting, and the tension in Michael Clayton is far superior to this film. I wouldn't consider this for any major Oscar Nominations.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A Lesser-Known Gangster Story,"In 1970s America, a detective works to bring down the drug empire of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), a heroin kingpin from Manhattan, who is smuggling the drug into the country from the Far East.Although the ""Black Mafia"" is not as well-known as its Italian counterpart, the names of Nicky Barnes and Bumpy Johnson have achieved widespread recognition. Frank Lucas, not so much. Though, if this film is close to reality, Lucas may have been even more successful than Barnes, Johnson or many of the Italian mobsters. (A scene even has an agent in disbelief that a black gangster could be so powerful, as he was too focused on the Italians to see other threats.)This film is tense, well-plotted and fascinating. Everyone loves a good crime film, and this is a very good crime film. Somehow, today (2015) it is not considered one of Ridley Scott's bigger films, but perhaps it should be. This easily rivals ""Gladiator"", for example.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Well made, but too familiar","Ridley Scott is one of those directors who has built up a lot of good will from audiences, including myself, over the years. But as each successive film of his is released, I find myself wondering why that is. Two of his movies, Alien and Blade Runner, are arguably masterpieces. Does he have more than maybe a couple more that are even good? Granted, I've missed a couple of well-liked works, notably Black Hawk Down, but the guy also has made Kingdom of Heaven, Hannibal and A Good Year. He's incredibly uneven. His newest film is a gangster epic. It's good, very classically made, respectable, entertaining enough. But it's nothing special. There is not even one moment in it where I was thinking ""wow"". Its best sequence, the raid on the drug lab, is easily topped by the similar scene in We Own the Night, which opened last month. Denzel Washington's performance isn't anything we haven't seen him give before, and Russell Crowe's is too methody to be considered very good (he was better in 3:10 to Yuma, but he was methody there, too). And it's a huge sin to waste Chiwetel Ejiofor this badly. The story is your basic criminal rise and fall, with a side story of the hard-working, honest cop. The film offers no insight into the situation. There are about seven montage sequences set to era-appropriate pop music. The honest truth is, I barely remembered I saw this movie four hours after it ended. If you've seen The Godfather or Goodfellas, you don't need to see it. On the other hand, if your options are this, Scarface or Blow, you'd be best off with this. Just don't pay too much for it. A rental, at best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Ridley Scott's gangster epic just misses 'classic' status,"American GangsterDirected by Ridley Scott. Starring Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe and Chiwetel Ejiofor.About halfway into ""American Gangster"", it becomes clear where the movie's strengths lie. The strong leading performances from Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe lift the film above typical gangster fare, but are not quite enough to secure it a place among classics such as ""The Godfather"" or ""Goodfellas."" The movie tells the true story of Frank Lucas, the man who gained notoriety in the 1970s for smuggling cocaine into the U.S. during the Vietnam War. Washington effortlessly embodies Lucas's persona, making the transformation from two-bit thug to unofficial King of Harlem all the more fascinating to watch on-screen.Director Ridley Scott knows his way around violent films, having collaborated with Crowe before in ""Gladiator."" However, Scott decides to ease up on the aggression this time around, allowing his more-than-capable stars to draw the audience in with their natural abilities. Of course, with a title like ""American Gangster"", one should not expect anything remotely kid-friendly. ""Gangster"" has its brutal moments, but they are not Scott's primary concern. He sets out to tell the story of Frank Lucas, and he takes an interesting approach.""Gangster"" spends the first two acts glorifying what Lucas does. It seems as though the life of this drug dealer is without significant problems. Only as the movie winds down does it begin to show the darker side of the business. This is where Scott slips up. Lucas is faced with problems at every turn, from the police to his own family, and it leaves him with feelings of mistrust and paranoia. But by praising Washington's character for two thirds of the film, it feels insincere when Scott suddenly becomes critical. This is the man the audience has been rooting for, and now he is supposed to be seen as the bad guy? The director seems unable to make up his mind, and it is illustrated in the film.Overall, ""American Gangster"" is one of the most entertaining films of the year. The running time may be pushing three hours and it may send out mixed messages, but great performances and thrilling action sequences more than make up for any missteps. Even the mildest fans of the crime genre owe it to themselves to give it a try and enjoy the ride.Final Grade: B+",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Solid and entertaining gangster movie but nothing special,"The title suggests a gangster movie of epic proportions. And the first time you see Denzel in action you think and hope that this movie will be like ""Scarface"" or ""The Godfather"". And I really wished I could say that. Sadly ""American Gangster"" doesn't deserve to be compared to those masterpieces! The fact that this movie is based on a true story does give some merit. But that doesn't mean that you have to ignore other parts that are so important when making making a movie. Denzel and Russel are more than solid in their performances. Although I had the feeling that Denzel repeated his role in ""Training Day"" that was downplayed considerably. Even then you can rely on these top notch actors. My main problem with this movie was the lack of intensity! There were very few dramatic or significant events that could have intensified the viewing experience. For the most time we get to see the business side of things. Very rarely we get to see the personal and emotional side of what characters are going through. This lack of depth is much needed. It would have made the characters far more interesting and easier for the viewer to make a connection. If you like movies like this you will enjoy it without a doubt.

The worst (or does this mean best?) of Hollywood is displayed in this movie that tries to be all things to all people, but ends up being nothing to anyone. Pointless. Violence for the sake of violence does not a movie make. The usual villains of corrupt cops, Italian thugs, and ""the man"" does not strike a chord.

A crime classic,"Ridley Scott's vast, intricate crime epic American Gangster is one of the director's finest achievement in film to this day. It's sprawling in nature, expansive in scope but never chaotic or muddled. It always maintains a laser focus on its characters and story, thumping along at a rhythmic pace which swells and falls to the time of one of the most iconic stories in true crime. It's Scott's Heat, a titanic tale of cop vs. criminal in which neither are the villain or hero, but simply men adhering to rigid, ruthless principles moulded by the environments they have grown up in. Both men have an intense set of morals completely different from the other, yet equally as captivating. Russell Crowe is a troubled bruiser as Detective Richie Roberts, a cop so determined to convince himself of his own upstanding nature that he won't take any illicit payoff in any amount or context. In contrast, every other aspect of his life is a shambling mess. Denzel Washington is quiet fury as Frank Lucas, an enterprising gangster and drug smuggler who rides the tidal wave of capitalism like there's no tomorrow, flooding the streets of Harlem with pure heroin directly from the southeast Asian source, and rising swiftly to the peak of underworld infamy. The two are on an inevitable collision course, two juggernauts with different empires backing them who will stop at nothing. Lucas believes himself to be untouchable, shirking the flashy, preening nature of his peers and remaining out of the limelight, until cunning Roberts catches onto him. The rough and tumble world of New York in the 60's and 70's is lovingly brought to life by Scott, his cast and crew who go to impressive lengths in order to bring us that grit, realism and specific anthropological aura of another time, another setting. Speaking of cast, this has to be one of the most rip roaring collection of actors ever assembled, even to rival that of Heat itself. In Richie's corner there is senior Detective Lou Toback (a sly Ted Levine, perpetuating the vague Michael Mann vibe even further), a scummy colleague (Yul Vasquez), and an off the books team of gangbusters including John Ortiz, John Hawkes and a mumbling RZA. He also clashes with his bitter ex wife (Carla Gugino) in an ugly custody battle for their young son. Over on Frank's side of the hill are his huge extended family including Common, TI, Chiwetel Ejfor and Ruby Dee in one of the film's finest performances as his strong willed, passionate mother, one of the only people who could talk sense into him and keep the animal inside at bay. Lymari Nadal is great as his bombshell Puerto Rican wife as well. His rivals include superfly-esque Nicky Barnes (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and a brief, hostile turn from Idris Elba. He also deals with the Italian mafia, personified by a hammy Armand Assante, an earnest Jon Polito and a slimy Ritchie Coaster. One of the best performances of the film comes from Josh Brolin as positively evil corrupt narcotics detective Trupo, threatening everything that moves with his grease slick hair, porno moustache and silky, dangerous tone. As if that army of talent wasn't enough, there's also work from Kevin Corrigan, Joe Morton, Clarence Williams III in a powerful turn as an ageing Bumpy Johnson, and a blink and you'll miss it cameo from Norman Reedus as well. What. A. Cast. The whole thing rests on Crowe and Washington, though, and both are like Olympian titans of crime and conflict, sweeping up everyone around them in a whirlwind of explosive violence, shifting alliances and the booming arrival of capitalism giving the American people in every walk of life a defibrillator jolt of economic change, laying the foundation for the world we live in today, one brick, one bullet, one business deal at a time. Scott achieves legendary heights with this one, a crime film for the ages that one can always revisit to see not how one hero cop took down a villainous drug lord, but how the forces which inexorably bind humans to various fates in accordance with their decisions swept up two extraordinary yet mortal men into historic infamy.

There wasn't anything special about the directing style but it still made the film very understandable.In this three hour movie Denzel Washington portrays an American drug dealer who rises into prominence during the late sixties and early seventies, what's unique about this character is the fact that he was a gangster of African American descent, something that was extremely rare back in those days, or was it? Based on a true story this film manages to impress viewers with good dialog and good acting especially from Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe.The movie delivers a clear message, no matter how bad-ass you are and no matter how careful you are, getting into the drug business is a bad idea, especially when underpaid honest cops are around. All Jokes aside, this movie is really good and its message can be interpreted in many ways, from a socio-political perspective or an anti-crime one to perhaps even a business ethics perspective, its up to you.Artistically this movie is great like I've stated before and I believe it deserves a 9\10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Classic Acting,"American Gangster (2007)**** (out of 4)Set in the 1970s, a detective (Russell Crowe) tries to bring down a notorious heroin kingpin (Denzel Washington). 2009 will mark the 100th anniversary of the first gangster film and I'm not sure if one small sub-genre has given us more great films. This is an incredibly little picture that packs quite a punch with its violence, moral lessons and storytelling. The film clocks in twenty-minutes short of the three hour mark but there's not a single second that comes off boring and there's not a single second where something great isn't going on. We've seen the rise of gangsters before but director Scott does a terrific job at making it feel fresh and new. The cinematography is terrific, the soundtrack great and the film has an authentic feel throughout. What really makes the film special is the screenplay takes time to look at Crowe and Washington outside their jobs. We see how the two men work but we also get to see how the two of them deal with stuff in their personal lives. The film takes its time telling the story but this is a big praise because we get to see more than one dimensional characters. Both Washington and Crowe deliver great performances and I might even go as far as to say it's the best of both of their careers. Both come with that calm and cool grace that most actors try for but fail at delivering but that's not the case with these two. How neither of them got an Oscar nomination is beyond me but I think time will be very friendly to both of them. Another strong aspect is the supporting cast, which includes Ruby Dee, Josh Brolin, Ted Levine, Cuba Gooding, Jr. and a terrific Armand Assante. There's a lot of intense dialogue from start to finish and near the end with get a classic shootout but the best moments of the film might take place at the very end when Washington and Crowe finally share the screen together. For the most part the film is very fast paced but it slows down at the very end when the two stars come together and their little chat gives one a lot to think about what they've seen.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Clichéd,"This film is largely cobbled together from the best bits of better gangster films of years gone by (Scarface, The Godfather, French Connection, Usual Suspects, a lot of Scorseses work) but it never rises beyond those flicks.There are one or two very good scenes and, for the most part the acting is solid. It is an incredibly clichéd movie though, right through to the end credits where we have a subtitled epilogue of what happened to the characters after the film ended.There are some very good scenes, but there are also some very bad scenes which border on being unintentionally funny.This is a film thats only really worth viewing on the big screen; watching it on your home system would only be detrimental to its value.This is a very studio produced film; its over-budgeted, the actors are over-paid. at times I was left wondering where the money went. If you're looking for ""Gladiator"" then don't bother; this has more in common with ""Hannibal"".It's not a patch on Scotts Blade Runner or Alien and its by far one of the least interesting things that Washington or Crowe have done.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A true to account story,"I just saw this movie and was simply glued to it. Never once, did I feel like leaving the hall. Director Ridley Scott does a very good job in telling an engrossing tale and keeps you glued for 2.5 hours which is a very very tough job. Now, the movie title might suggest that there is lot of killing and gun firing, but mind you it is not.If you are looking for a heavy action movie, don't waste your money and go see something else. Because, this movie is for people who enjoy true biopics. Someone who will enjoy a good story telling. I also read Mark Jacobson's article "" Retun of superfly"" on which this movie is based. I gathered a rather satanic picture of Frank Lucas from the article but surprisingly enough, Denzel Washington who has given us some stellar performances, does not depict Lucas very well. He plays ""himself"" extremely well. So does Crowe. But his character did not need him to go to the depths of John Nash or James Braddock. So was a little disappointed with Denzel Washington's performance. This movie is not in the leagues of godfather or scarface, does not make any exaggerated statement, what it does is beautifully tell the tale of a man who rose from the poor to become one of the biggest heroin dealers in USA. If you like such tales and also want a take home message, then you would love this movie. 9/10 !",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Fantastic American Gangster film! ( B+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10,"It captures the 70s era perfectly. With great acting, screenplay, and direction it turns out to be one of Scott's better movies",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Well Done!!,"The acting by Denzel Washington was superb! I believe that he enjoys playing this type of role (""Training Day,"" etc). Russell Crowe was very good. James Brolin made you really hate him. This usually means that the actor did a good job. Good direction. Good photography, a little dark at times, but well shot. Good story line that was interesting and easy to follow. Politics must have had something to do with the fact that the movie did not win any academy awards. The ending was somewhat surprising, but done well. In my opinion, Denzel Washington should have won the best actor award and that Russell Crowe should have won best supporting actor.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Dead Movie Walking,"Ridley Scott makes an awful lot of noise in his well heeled films and says very little. American Gangster is no exception. This glossy and slick looking tale about a Harlem drug kingpin and the cop that brought his empire down is a slow moving, disjointed and suspenseless two and a half hour bore. Even though the film primarily focuses on its two main characters they never really develop much from the first reel. Gangster Denzel Washington moves Sphinx like throughout the film. Looking like he stepped off the cover of GQ, his handsome sinister look never really takes off and when he does go into an occasional rage, it is unconvincing and inconsistent to a character that sleep walks through most of the film. The opening scene immediately establishes the savagery Lucas is willing to administer to maintain power but then the rest of the film is spent attempting to sanitize him.Russell Crowe, a lot more animated, is terrible as well but for different reasons. Once again he is the working class stiff super hero who can do no wrong as he maintains a squeaky clean honesty throughout, refusing bribes, turning in partners and bucking a law enforcement system that seems to be totally corrupt. In addition he is working his way through law school which will give him added superpowers in the films epilogue and of course he manages to screw hot chicks, display his tough guy and sensitive side and on more than one occasion step in to save the day. His only flaw seems to be his lack of fatherly attention to his son. However even this is assuaged when his wife goes into a tirade about his poor parenting skills but is quickly mollified by his martyr like explanation. A sense of shame comes across her face. Even though her outburst is justified it's hard to hate this gruff but lovable shaggy dog, the most honest man in all of New York.While too much time is wasted on Detective Roberts story it does enable director Scott to juxtapose heavy handed irony all over the place. On Thanksgiving, straight arrow Roberts sits home in a cluttered apartment having a sandwich of dry turkey and potato chips. Meanwhile at the Lucas mansion Scott creates a wonderful mise en scene that evokes a Norman Rockwell Saturday Evening Post cover. He likes it so much that he replicates it later in the film. Much of the film is overkill with repeated montages of violence and intravenous drug use. Scott shows a real nostalgia (along with the requisite cheap shot Hollywood interpretation of a racist, antisemitic, incompetent portrayal of government officials) for the Seventies but it never gets below the surface. It is all gloss and pose and lacks the passion and realism of the excellent 70's cop films, The French Connection and Serpico which it attempts to imitate.National treasure Ruby Dee is treated just like one and her performance as Frank's mother reflects it. It is one of many failed opportunities by Scott to flesh out Lucas as a man through his relationships with family and friends. The one with his wife is nearly invisible. Her major contribution to the film is getting the reserved Lucas to dress up like Super Fly. Josh Brolin's corrupt Detective Trupo is the film's only bright spot. He portrays a fierceness and intensity far more convincing than anything else in this entire film. American Gangster deserves the death penalty.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Oscar - material,"Why this movie didn't even make it to the Oscar nomination list? I do not understand. It is arguably one of the best, if not THE BEST movie I have seen in 2007.It is a complete, thrilling movie, that keeps you rooted to your seat. Denzel Washington's brilliant performance made me acquire older movies that he stares in. He really shows class and skill, portraying the change that took place in the character, almost like a ""mafioso"", only not with an Italian accent. Russell Crowe turns in an excellent performance as well, being an honest cop in a corrupt society. When I saw this movie, I did not know it was inspired from a true story, until the ending credits.American Gangster definitely made it to my Top 10 List, which include masterpieces such as The Shawshank Redeption, Titanic, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Goodfellas, Se7en, The Departed, The Pianist and the list goes on.If you have enjoyed any of the movies listed above, then I highly recommend American Gangster to you.

love it,"American Gangster works on numerous levels. It's in part a portrait of late 60s-early 70s Harlem and America, full of drugs and desperation and weakness, where the strong rise above the rest and the cops are dirtier than the rats. As a crime thriller it's entertaining and at 2 hours 37 minutes, never loses interest. But, maybe most surprisingly, it's also a superb character drama and study. Literally every character who steps on screen is compelling, has depth to them, has their motivations, and is tossed into conflict. For example there's a scene early on where Crow's character Richie and his partner are searching a parked car and find a very large amount of unmarked money in the trunk. Without giving away more, it and the following scenes lead to some surprising moral and character statements by Scott. Richie's morals vs everyone else the temptation of the streets is commonly laid on him throughout the film, and thanks to Crow's great great performance, it adds a lot to the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Far from being Scott's best work, it still however is a riveting crime picture.","This is the true story of 1970s Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas who submarined the Mafia gangs by importing his heroin uncut direct from Thailand, and thus able to corner the drug market with cheaper prices. On his trail is Richie Roberts, one of the few honest cops operating out of his corrupt department.American Gangster may turn out to be one of the most divisive films in Ridley Scott's cannon, gone are the visual traits that are beloved by so many of his fans, and in comes straight forward story telling, heavy on plot and filmed as a near to a documentary style as Scott has ventured thus far in a mainstream picture. I have no doubt that cries of Scott merely dipping his toes in crime picture waters from the past will be used against him, and for sure there is nothing remotely new in the Steve Zaillian screenplay here to make anyone sit up and take notice. But I applaud Scott for making, what on the page looked to have been a run of the mill crime caper, into a riveting character study. Full of 70s fashions and police procedural gusto, American Gangster lifts itself above the average crime capers of yesteryear because it boasts two of the best actors working today in the lead roles.Russell Crowe plays Richie Roberts with much restraint, and it's thru this restraint that the character becomes more believable, Roberts has his issues for sure (notably of the romantic kind), but his unflinching deep rooted belief in honesty gives the character an earthy aura, and it's down to Crowe that the character succeeds on the screen. Taking the honours here, though, is Denzel Washington as Frank Lucas, full of zest and charming menace, he infuses Lucas with credibility as both a caring family man and also a merciless crime lord. Great performances, both. American Gangster is a fine film on the screen, but on the page it looks to be lacking in bravery or any sort of invention, but it's nice to see Ridley Scott taking on yet another genre and at the very least making it a notch above many other directors best works in the epic crime caper pantheon. 9/10Footnote: I have recently caught the extended cut which has a further 17 minutes added to the original theatrical release. Of most interest is the alternate ending that is nice as regards watching Crowe & Washington share more screen time, but in light of the big picture you can see why it was cut. Stick with the theatrical version is my honest opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Ridley Scott's ScarGodFellas,"After this rewatch I felt this movie did not hit as it should. It feels like a movie that borrows too much from gangster movies seen before, to a degree where it becomes distracting. But the movie misses what were interesting and the aspect that lifted the movies before it, the compelling characters. While this movie is still good and entertaining after a slow start, the two main characters feel like cookie cutter versions of what they actually should have been. I don't feel the crime aspects of gangster movies to be the most compelling part, it´s the people who do it and why they are doing it that is interesting.We follow two people, each on the upside side of the law from each other. Frank Lucas is an upcoming crime lord after the death of his mob boss mentor who uses the drug addiction to heroin during the Vietnam war to grow his empire. On the other side is Richie Roberts, an honest cop who, unlike every cop around him, doesn't take bribes of any kind.What really made me like this movie a bit less was that I felt like I could get the fix this movie provides from so many other and in my opinion better movies. While genre tropes are of course a factor here and you can´t chance too much, this movie doesn't feel like it has its own identity but builds on the shoulders of giants instead. The montage scenes set to the era and fitting music for the ethnicity of the gang music works but feels like something ripped from Scarface (1983) together with the mad decent of a crime lord. A scene with a downfall set to church music feels like the Godfather (1972). This movie can feel like the director had a ""I also want my gangster movie out there"" moment but just did it because his pierce before him did it. In that regard the movie can feel similar but of course it handles it´s subject matter in its own way and in a good way too, but not to the same standards of the movies you are clearly inspired by and that takes it down a peg.The other big problem of the movie to me is the focus. Instead of focusing on Lucas and Roberts and why they act and do as they do, it is just implied and the movie focuses more on the crime aspect. To me that just isn't the most interesting part of a gangster movie, the what isn't that interesting but the why is far more interesting, why are the people the way they are? This movie has Roberts that becomes a parody of himself, always saying ""I´m honest, I don´t lie, I follow the law"" to a degree that makes him 2 dimensional since that is his entire character. Lucas is a more interesting character but isn't given the time to really have a voice to know why he dose it. The later talk scene between the two really highlights the 2 characters much better than the movie had done throughout it´s entire runtime. The evolution of Lucas character also comes out of nowhere going from ""family is the most important"" to straight up murdering people left and right with temper tantrums. This evolution should have been the focus of the movie. Seen before? Yes, but at least compelling character analysis.I really liked the soundtrack though; it feels fitting of the time and ads to the black American ethnic tones of the movie. The songs included sounds great and works great with the movie. I must say, and call me woke warrior or whatever, but having a white director and composer dictating what is black American ethnic music feels weird? I don't know, I feel like it works and it vibes with the movie but yeah, rubs me the wrong way. The score is also good. The use of bass is really prominent and works great with the suspenseful moments of the movie.I also need to criticize the climax of the movie. It has such an incredible and intense lead up only to become a jumbled mess of edited confusion. I think they were going for a chaotic vibe, but it became more of a messy one where I couldn't really follow the movie. Again, I think it´s un purpose and it worked to some extend but maybe tone down the chaos just a small bit.This movie has a really slow start, and it was only after a while I really got interested in the movie. I think it´s because the characters aren't set up well, so I´m just waiting for the case to start really. I think the movie could easily had started there and it wouldn't have hurt the story at all.The balance between the two leads isn't the greatest. I find Lucas a million times more compelling than Roberts and it took me way longer to get into Roberts's storyline. Him battling with parental custody really just feels like filler in this movie and it´s only when he becomes more of a detective his story becomes somewhat amusing. Focusing more on the characters would have made this movie stand out more and maybe cutting it down to primarily following one of them would have helped it even more.I loved the ending though. Having these characters confront each other and expose what they really think is wrong is satisfying leading to the strongest scene in the movie and really making them both work of each other in the best way possible.American Gangster is your average gangster movie that don't feel like it has a lot of identity of it´s own. Some of it´s strongest scenes and aspects feels ripped from movie before it and only when it focuses on the story it wants to tell, it feels like itself. The story is compelling but isn't given an anchor to make the story compelling enough, a bigger enthesis on the characters and making them more fleshed out would suit the movie more. This is by no means a bad movie, but it feels generic in too many places to really elevate itself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Washington plays the bad guy so good,"With Denzel Washington's performance in American Gangster and also in Training Day and the upcoming Safe House his best performances are when he go the bad guy route. He's really good as the good guy like he's in Remember the Titans, Inside Man, Unstoppable and so on. But he really comes alive when he goes to the other side of the aisle.Russell Crowe is also very good in this movie as the detective who then also serves as the prosecutor is the one responsible for bringing down Washington's character of Frank Lucas who was one of the most powerful cocaine smugglers/king pins in US history. Frank took over the Harlem drug trade after legendary gangster Bumpy Johnson died.Josh Brolin plays a corrupt NYPD detective who tries to blackmail Lucas.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
No Soul.,"What American Gangster lacked was not action, a better script or competent directing. It had all three of those in spades, plus everything else one needs to create an epic drama in the spirit of Scarface, The Deer Hunter, etc. My only issue was that it tried soooo hard to live up to the great 70's/80's epics that it fell miserably short. It became a sloppy poseur instead of a genuine piece of art.Now, I don't know who to blame for this (I mean, even the poster of the film is like the classic Scarface poster!) so I won't start naming names. All that needs to be known was that it was obvious. It was cliché and it was sloppy. Very very sloppy.Hollywood HEAR US!!

Thoroughly mediocre,"This is basically a paint-by-numbers crime drama, and I didn't like it much at all. Not only is it just repeating themes and story lines that have been done ad nauseum in older, better films, but it brings absolutely nothing new to the table. The characters are all very conventional, unsurprising, and totally bland. Any attempt to add depth into these one-dimensional, shadowy figures comes across as very obvious and totally disingenuous. Crowe's character is occasionally interesting, but he soon reverts to the ""womanizing boy scout"" that is too natural, and, thus, not natural at all. Denzel is just playing Denzel, there's no hint of danger or hostility in his performance, even when he's performing criminal acts. You get the sense that he could stop selling drugs and coach a football team. The dialogue is all very obvious and to-the-point, the sets and costumes are loud and garish and, again, far too obvious, and the direction is uninspired and largely unremarkable. It's a solidly made, but thoroughly mediocre mob tale.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

A Nutshell Review: American Gangster,"Ridley Scott's American Gangster has many similar parallels to Derek Yee's Protégé, in that it's a story about the scourge of drugs, and each containing the respective insights into the entire production, processing and distribution processes, stemming again from material sources in South East Asia. While the latter is a fictional account, American Gangster is based on the true story of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), the black drug lord whose meteoric rise to power was deemed incredulous because of race and colour, and the story of the detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) whose team had broken through the complex web of mon dealings to take down the gangsters, as well as their corrupt own.This epic movie, clocking in at slightly more than 2.5 hours, takes its time to tell the respective stories, which on their own could be standalone equivalents, no doubt boosted by the powerhouse performances by award winning actors Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, who is into his third collaboration with Ridley after movies like Gladiator and A Good Year. While the story may seem straight-forward without any spectacular twists and turns, it's based solely on the credible performances as well as the re-creation of the late 60s-early 70s environment of New York, where blatant corruption seemed to be the norm of the day.Crowe's Richie perhaps have the lesser screen time of the two, like an Elliot Ness equivalent in being the incorruptible cop in a corrupt force, whose reputation of turning in a million dollars instead of pocketing it, preceded him. This made him an automatic choice in creating his own squad of Untouchables, assembling a team of similarly principled men to work outside the system, to go after the big fish. While his boy scout character might seem boring, here's where the script by Steven Zaillian adds a little flavour in throwing in shades of grey. While Richie is honest to his job, a little examination into his private life has him being quite the ladies' man, as well as struggling with his estranged wife to fight for custody of their child.Washington's Frank Lucas on the other hand, had the meat, given after all the movie is about the crime lord. The first hour charted his rise and it is the buildup that makes this movie so compelling as it tapers toward the inevitable finale, as you discover how deep the rot of corruption is, and having links to the Vietnam War and the army. His ""Blue Magic"" heroin product sells for half the price and double the potency as middlemen are cut off, and shipment is relatively free - I'd dare say this is ingenious, and makes a monkey out of the authorities.And it is his segment that proved to be more interesting of the two - OK, so everyone would like to know how he did what he did, versus a straight cop's quest to putting away those involved with the entire business. There were many fine points made especially for those who are in the business of being crooked. If you notice all the high profile corporate fraud cases, most are done in because money corrupts one into an opulent lifestyle, bringing uncalled for attention to oneself. Here, Lucas' principle is similar, to keep a low profile, but alas everyone has their moment of oversight and carelessness.To continue my admiration of the guy's work ethics, and probably because of the nature of the business, no one is trusted except for family. I guess a crime family is easier to raise since blood is supposedly more trustworthy than random hired hands. While we see Richie's assembly of a few good men for his cause of righteousness, we also witness the creation of a mob family from scratch, but as we all know, time will tell if the kinks within the family can be worked out, or go against the ruler with an iron fist. Scott somehow seemed to emphasize family for a fair bit, with periodic shots for comparison put side by side for the audience to form their conclusions.Don't be expecting any major scenes of killing, choosing instead to be based on powerful dialogue as the gun battles here are few and far between, usually over as quickly as they start because Frank Lucas doens't fall into the usual fictional villains' lapse into monologues. The action sequences might be few, but they are sure pack their punch despite their short duration. Everything's paced rather nicely, and I particularly enjoyed the entire buildup, though the ending felt a little rushed because there are little that could be elaborated at that point. Fans of Denzel and Russell who want to see these two strong actors share the same screen/scene, will be a tad disappointed, as they do so only toward the finale, lasting no more than 10 minutes, but those turn out to be the gem they were, so savour every moment of it properly.The second mobster movie this week, it's a difficult toss up between Ridley Scott's American Gangster and David Cronenberg's Eastern PRomises. If you're tired of blood and gore with a twist, and would prefer something based on a true story told in a more straightforward manner, then American Gangster will be your choice. IF I may say, there's nothing really spectacular about the plot, but it works, thanks to Ridley Scott's confident direction, and the A-plus performances by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Ridley Scott's Epic,"Ridley Scott is one of the finest directors and why the Academy Awards keeps snubbing him is beyond me.This is truly an epic film, depicting the gritty New York/New Jersey drug scene in the 1970's. Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington are the main protagonists and both are sublime as usual. To me, the real badass of the film is Josh Brolin. He steals every scene as Detective Trupo of the Special Investigations Unit. Such corruption was commonplace in the 1960's and 70's, which resulted in Frank Serpico exposing the widespread practice of cops ""on the take."" Crowe is excellent as the honest cop searching for a decent team of crusaders to solve the puzzle of the distributor of Blue Magic.The attention to detail in recreating 1970's New York is outstanding. The whole picture has a ""French Connection"" feel.The supporting cast is great too: Cuba Gooding Jr., Armand Assante et al.This is a really great film. However, as I commented on the message board, the one thing that disturbed me was the fawning over the real Frank Lucas on the extras DVD. This is a man who killed people directly or indirectly and people were all too willing to ""kiss his ring"" when he was on the set. Is there any decency at all anymore?",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
These similarities and differences make the meeting between the two characters far more satisfying than Heat could ever be,"As crime epics go, American Gangster is fairly pedestrian but also one of the more enjoyable that I've ever seen. A double-whammy of this and Thelma & Louise has done a great deal for my faith in Ridley Scott's direction.This three hour film rarely drags after the first 20 minutes, which is a big achievement in both scripting and editing. The film balances the stories of two compelling men - African American gangster Frank Lucas, and the honest cop trying to catch him, Richie Roberts. Lucas, the respectable, intelligent crime lord is portrayed adequately by Denzel Washington. He never captures the Al Pacino ruthlessness or the Jack Nicholson cockiness, but he's still a compelling character to watch and even root for at times. Russell Crowe is very reminiscent of his Bud White LA Confidential days, but it was great then and even better here. He is less of a thug and has a few moments of nerves and timidity that give his character a humanity rarely seen in Crowe performances. The thing I loved about the film was how similar and different Lucas and Roberts are. They both hate corrupt cops and strive for integrity in their dealings, while taking hugely unorthodox actions to succeed. Meanwhile, compare the two - Lucas is a ""bad guy"" who loves his mother, goes to church and cares for his family above all else. Roberts is the ""good guy"", but he's engaged in a bitter divorce because of his infidelity, and never has time for his son. These similarities and differences make the meeting between the two far more satisfying than Heat could ever be.In the supporting cast, Josh Brolin is terrific as Detective Trupo, managing to be a terrific antagonist for both Lucas and Roberts. Ruby Dee is also excellent in a small part - she blusters and flails in her loving attempts to connect with a son whose world she can never fully understand. There's a level of honesty and generosity to her performance that makes me commend her Academy Award nomination, even if her limited screen time would have made me uncomfortable voting for her for a win.American Gangster is beautifully scripted as well, which is vital for setting it apart from its many counterparts. Of the many beautifully constructed scenes, Richie's divorce proceedings and Carla Gugino's rant is probably the film's highlight. It gives both a perspective of how Laurie sees her husband and how Roberts sees himself, all whilst giving some of the film's best quotes and a blistering dramatic moment all in one. A great mixture of words and delivery is always necessary for a great film, and American Gangster never disappoints on that front.It may be a long burn, but American Gangster is very satisfying to complete, far more so than Heat or the Godfather Part II, and I really recommend that you check it out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Saved by the stars,"I know that films which are supposed to be 'based on a true story' can sometimes be a little, er, 'liberal' with the truth and, seeing as I haven't researched how accurate 'American Gangster' is, I'm judging it on pure entertainment values alone. In the seventies, Denzil Washington plays an up and coming drugs kingpin from Harlem who quickly rises through the ranks to form such a vast empire that it also includes three quarters of the New York police department. However, one law officer who refuses to be corrupted is played by fellow acting heavyweight, Russell Crowe, who vows to bring in Washington and all those he's employed - whether drug dealers of police officers alike.Seeing as it's based on a real life case, they couldn't really put in wall-to-wall shoot-outs and car chases, mixed with unexpected twists and double crosses. Therefore, what you're left with is quite a subdued little film which could - if in the wrong hands - actually be quite dull. Luckily, with the acting pedigree in front of the camera and Ridley Scott behind it (I must confess... I only knew he directed it when his name came up in the end credits!) a film that's actually over two hours never feels like it outstays its welcome.I guess the only real criticism is that the two leads never really get the chance to play off each other like you may want them to. But then the story dictates that 'cop' and 'robber' don't spend that much time having coffee and donuts together in real life, therefore why should they ever really meet on screen until handcuffs are involved? In that was I found it kind of like 'Heat' which was the first film to properly star the other great acting heavyweights Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino. Many went to see it because of their star power, only to be left a little disappointed at the lack of time they spend on screen together.Both Washington and Crowe play 'flawed' characters - both having their good and bad sides and you'll sympathise and despise them in equal measures. It may not be up there with some of the greatest 'cops and robbers' films and it definitely doesn't really fit into the 'gangster' genre, but, if you're in the mood for something deliberately slowly-paced then this one is worth a couple of hours of your time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Cutting the middleman, buying directly from the supplier. Ridley Scott delivers once again a compelling and extremely well narrated movie.","'American Gangster' feels like a movie of another era. Ridley Scott gradually builds up the story of Frank Lucas, who starts as the right arm for a local boss in Harlem, and then becomes the new drug lord first of his neighbourhood and then expands nationwide. On the other side, we have a New York cop that handles a task force, aiming to stop this business. Premises are very simple, however the plot is full of plot twists and intrigues. The film is not scared to show the dark side of heroin, what it does to consumers, in a world that was quickly changing, where the conflict in Vietnam was ending, where the reseller started buying directly from the supplier, and of course Frank is a product of its time. There are strong images, and we get to see the political and social context of that time through TV or radio transmissions, passing on the background. It is a movie that is not scared to show the cold reality of its time.The script is extremely solid, the relationship between different characters are believable and nothing feels forced, or out of place. It is a movie that kept me on the verge. There are some sequences that are really tense, where I was wondering what was going to happen. If a person has to die, he or she will die, if a person is hurt he or she will end up in the hospital. There is no discount for anyone, it does not matter if you are a cop, or a bad guy, if you end up in the crossfire, there will be serious consequences.The cast is amazing, lots of great names are involved here. I really liked Denzel Washington and I think he delivered a wonderful performance. He managed to play the part of a cold and organized crime lord perfectly. When he needed to make a decision, he would just act, without the blink of an eye. Russell Crowe is a cop tired of injustices that just want to build a better world, and it does not matter if he needs to put his life on the line. However is not one of those wannabe heroes that goes in completely alone and wins. He has a team watching his back, he plans, he observes every move of his nemesis and then he executes his strategy. And this is something that you do not see a lot in recent movies. There are also other big names such Idris Elba, Josh Brolin and Cuba Gooding Jr. The cast is simply phenomenal and performances are top notch.Definitely a classic worth watching. After all these years, it still feels fresh and way better than the average flick released nowadays.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Partly biographical story about a Harlem drug lord whose real life inspired the film and is relentlessly pursued by a stubborn cop .,"In 1968, Ellsworth ""Bumpy"" Johnson (Clarence Williams III), a disciplined and intelligent gangster, runs much of Harlem and imparts his wisdom to Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), his former limo driver, now turned out his right-hand man. Ruthless Frank lords it over a New York neighbourhood with an empire built on dope and violence. He and his brothers go about getting cooperation through violence and coercion, while they take the poor neighborhoods of New York by storm. The crime lord ascends to power and becomes megalomaniacal while a maverick police team vows to stop him. In 1970s America, detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) sets out to bring down the drug empire of Frank Lucas , a heroin kingpin from Manhattan, who is smuggling the drugs into the country in the coffins of soldiers from the Vietnam War. Meanwhile Richie is juggling a failing marriage (to Carla Gugino), late-night law school classes, and his police career. When Richie and his partner, Javier Rivera (John Ortiz), discover nearly $1 million in unmarked bills in a car, Richie resists temptation and turns the money in. There are two sides to the American dream !. When Hoodlum Bumpy influences American Gangster Frank Lucas !. . It was a time that there was a new gangster in.........They're a new breed of gangster !. The new public enemy !. The new family of crime !. Where survival depends on friends, trust and power... !An organized crime family out to run this city is up against cops who knows its streets !.A thriller/drama with action, tension, intrigue and violent events. Based on the true story of Frank Lucas, who became one of the most powerful drug traffickers in the USA in the 1960s including a great main cast: Washington, Crowe giving awesome interpretation and It also features good performances from a long supporting cast. The rise and fall of a mobster offers another very different story for Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe in their best acting period. Ridley Scott directs Denzel and Russell in this police drama that was nominated for two Oscars (best supporting actress) and three Golden Globes (best dramatic film, director and actor in drama: Ruby Dee and production design).It is presented with punch and precision, being efficiently shot. This is a very violent, but crisp and cleanly made narcotics thriller. Just say no ghetto-melodrama but an action movie with thrills, intrigue, shoot'em up, suspenseful, and lots of violence. Depicting a slight study of drug proliferation, violent gangs and its effects on poor neighborhoods. The film pays lip service to social analysis while delighting paraphernalia of action and violence. As such, it's a superior example of what used to be called blaxploitation, with Denzel Washington piling on corruption and carnage for all he's worth. Powerful acting for the always versatil Denzel Washington as wealthy drug lord sought by rebel cops led by Russell Crowe. Fine playing all around otherwise, lots of action and strong dialogue you can hear, other familiar secondary actors include the following: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Josh Brolin, Lymari Nadal, Ted Levine, Roger Smith , John Hawkes , Yul Vazquez , Ruby Dee , Ruben Santiago-Hudson, Carla Gugino, John Ortiz, Cuba Gooding Jr., Joe Morton, Armand Assante, Kathleen Garrett, Jon Polito, Norman Reedus, Ritchie Coster, Tip 'T. I.' Harris, Idris Elba, Kevin Corrigan, among othersIt contains an adequate musical score fitting to enviroment from Marc Streitenfeld. Likewise, an atmospheric and evocative cinematography -set apropriately in the sixties- by cameraman Harris Savides. Nicely put together in an old fashioned style by expert filmmaker Ridley Scott. This great producer/director Scott shoots with elegance, majesty and skill, as he has proven in many films, such as: ¨Someone to watch over me¨ , ¨Blade runner¨, ¨Black Rain¨, in which his visual style is extremely slender. His stunning visuals - he personally sketches most of his own storyboards, left-handed, with great artistic style . And demonstrating his masterful artisanal hand in the historical genre, of which he is a skilled creator , such as: ¨Gladiator¨,¨Robin Hood¨, ¨Kingdom of heaven¨, ¨Duellists¨ ,¨Black Hawk down¨, ¨The last duel¨, ¨Napoleon¨. Rating American Gangster (2007): 7/10. Essential and indispensable watching for Ridley Scott followers. Well worth seeing .",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
one of Denzel's best Performances.,Denzel Washington never dissapoints.This is one of Denzel's most famous movie's directed by Ridley Scott.Denzel Washington And Russel Crowe both done a phenominal acting performance espically Denzel Washington.The story is very good it kinda reminds me of Scarface but this movie is Better Than scarface in my opinion simply because of how good the direction is and how it shows the start till the end and the ways that Frank Lucas does his job as an American Gangster.Russel Crowe's character is smart he tries his best to catch any evidance that will support his case agianst Frank Lucas and he did a lot of stuff that payed at the end.The final hour of the film was very good simply because of how intimidating the scenes are and how good the dialogue is and the last hour was the best part in the movie.Overall a very good film that depicts the Frank Lucas character very well.8/10.,8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Ridley Scott gives us an unforgettable and incredible experience, American Gangster is a must watch","American Gangster is directed and produced by Ridley Scott whilst Steven Zaillian penned the script. The direction is perfect, no doubt about it. The script is also great.
The film is based on the criminal career of Frank Lucas, he was a drug trafficker who operated in Harlem during the late 1960s and early 1970s. In this movie we get to see his rise to the big drug trafficker he became and how he smuggled heroin into the United States. We also follow Richie Roberts throughout the film and gets to see his character arc which is well written, he then helps to set up a task force that is out to send Frank Lucas and other drug traffickers in prison.
Both character arcs are extremely well written and important to the plot.Frank Lucas' story is interesting and worth knowing about, American Gangster does a phenomenal job at telling a fictionalized version of the events, as it's still a film and they to make a movie that sells. I really recommend watching a documentary or just reading about him to get the real story, both Frank Lucas and Richie Robert have said that most of the movie is fictional so don't go into the film for accuracy. But I'm here to talk about the movie, and after watching the theatrical cut back in 2014 I believe, I found it to be a great movie and worth the hype and acclaim. Now I got the chance to watch the extended cut and it was so worth coming back to the movie as it only improved it and gave me more of the good stuff. It's easy to get immersed into the movie for one thing and it's the most important thing, authenticity. The streets and all sets that were used in the movie has that 60-70's vibe. Art direction is worthy of its Oscar nomination, simply brilliant.Denzel Washington plays Frank Lucas in possibly his best performance, he nails everything with the role and I'm certain he got the mannerism right, at least some. It's an overall unforgettable and phenomenal performance.
Russell Crowe portrays the other lead character, another historical figure, Richie Robert. Same as Denzel's performance, his is remarkable and memorable, possibly one of his best performances. He also watched tapes on the real Richie to get the voice and mannerism right, respect for that.
The film also co-stars Ted Levine, John Ortiz, Josh Brolin, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Ruby Dew, Norman Reedus, Idris Elba, Lymari Nadal and Cuba Gooding Jr.
There's also a lot of other actors, many recognizable names but I can't name them all. Ruby Dee got an Oscar nomination for her role as Mama Lucas, amazing performance.The film is well shot, each scene is astonishing to look at. Huge thanks to the cinematography, art direction and production design. It isn't as stylish as Kingdom of Heaven for an example but it's two totally different movies, this one is gorgeous in its own way.American Gangster does everything right, I would personally call it a masterpiece but that's my opinion. You could say that it isn't an original story and that's true, but does it work? I really think so, and it's a nice change of pace to see African-Americans in roles like these as there's a lot of criminals out there to explore, that fits movies like these.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Hard Hitting Drama cum Thriller,"""American Gangster"" shouldn't be reckoned another thriller based on the life of a Drug dealer. Because it's more than just a politically correct documentary of a Drug dealer, who used the Vietnam War to supplement his drug business great times in the mean streets of New York. The perfect casting, impeccable direction, taut storyline and great mix of action and thrill make it one of the best thrillers of the year.Cast wise, it's the Master Ridley Scott at work. Clearly, he has a special liking for the two lead actors, having casted them in several of his movies. Russell Crowe brings his rough charm into his detective role, which is greatly complimented by Denzel Washington's calm demeanor gangster portrayal. Josh Brolin is an icing on cake for this wonderful cast.The movie is wonderfully paced. Never one feels bored or letdown by the pace of the movie. Ridley Scott bought his two gems (Crowe and Denzel) together perfectly, making a movie which attains the tension, agility, brutality and conflict of a perfect drama based thriller movie. The best thing is it's a hard hitting thriller, but little plot holes. The climax is very consistent with the movie's plot.Overall, ""American Gangster"" delivers all that it promises. After all, the trio of Crowe, Scott and Denzel makes three of a kind.My Verdict: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Either you're somebody, or you're nobody","Based on a true story. In the 60's and 70's(completely believably recreated, meticulous as every other aspect of the production, and the music fits period and mood alike), Harlem-resident(and still proud) Frank Lucas(Washington, suave, yet when his temper gets a hold of him, terrifying) wants to take over his late employers drug empire... and expand it, importing heroin directly from the Far East. This chronicles his rise, and gives equal screen time to the attempts of Richie Roberts(Crowe, confident and honest, with a weak spot for his kid) to find(he's smart about hiding what he's doing) and apprehend him. This is gritty and doesn't pull its punches - whilst clearly admiring(even if not condoning) Denzel, it never shies away from showing him break bones and faces, there is racism from both sides(or, er, colors), and some of the cops are shown to also be corrupt. It feels visceral, and is immensely realistic. The pace is fast throughout(and one or two bits have gripping tension), and scenes never go on for too long - heck, a lot of the time, it'll go to a new geographical place, and much of this subverts your expectations(clearly showing how recent it is). Mood is set swiftly, and can change in an instant. The humor works. All of the acting from this ensemble cast is great(create a drinking game, take a shot every time you recognize a talent... or do a trivia-based one, see how many of them you can name), and even with the many characters, not only do they all feel genuine, like they'd exist outside of fiction, you don't have trouble remembering who wants what or why(it juggles them all well). Now, this is clearly done with a love for the subgenre - however, it doesn't quite live up to the likes of Heat, Goodfellas, Godfather and Scarface, and, in fact, feels slightly derivative of those classics, taking at least one event from each(and then not doing it better, only almost as well). There is a lot of strong language, some brutal, graphic, disturbing violence, a little sexuality and full female nudity in this. The DVD comes with an interesting, informational commentary by Ridley Scott and writer Steven Zaillian for the theatrical cut, and both that version and the unrated Director's Cut(that adds 18 minutes, and thus runs 2 hours and 41 minutes sans credits, or 7 and a half minutes more with), which I suggest you go for if you aren't scared off by the running time(don't worry, it keeps you watching) - not that it's short without it(it's not a completely different viewing, it's just even more of a good thing). I recommend this to any fan of biographies, crime-dramas and/or fans of those involved in making it. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
American Gangster may not be The Godfather but it is just as engrossing at times.,"Ridley Scott does like to tackle a variety of genres and topics, from classic sci-fi to religious epics. Now he has put the eternal battle for drug enforcement under his belt also. I'm just waiting for him to tackle the important subject of fluffy unicorns that shoot rainbows...Hollywood, make it happen. Based on the true story, gangster Frank Lucas monopolises the drug trafficking scene in New York City. Making both friends and enemies. Hot behind his tail though is detective Richie Roberts who is cracking down on the city's drug war. How do you make such a formulaic film so compelling you might ask? You bring in the big acting guns. Oh yes! Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. Washington in particular gives a commanding performance where he owns every scene. Whether it be a calm demeanour or full on rage mode, you don't mess with Frank Lucas. Crowe is absolutely fine, but feels completely underpowered when comparing to Washington's performance. It's not his fault, he is just up against a powerhouse. Supporting cast, again, just didn't make much of an impact. The story was involving for the most part, felt very realistic. Fantastic drug heist shootout during the third act. Scott's artistic flair makes even the most basic of scenes look exciting. The biggest negative, and is unfortunately a massive deal, is the first hour. It is such a drag and is completely uninteresting. It's either too quick or too slow, never perfectly balanced. Stuff happens to which I just don't care. As soon as Roberts is on Lucas' case is when the film gets going. Also the personal aspects to Roberts' life does not develop him as a character and feel unnecessary. It's a long runtime and it does feel like it occasionally, but once the plot gets going it is rather engrossing and does host one of Washington's better performances. I could listen to him say ""My Man!"" everyday.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great true story with little fabrication!!,"Personally i think that director Marty Scorcese is the king of this genre however will have to admit that Ridley Scott did a fine job here, alleviating from his usual sci-fi genre that he also directs so well. American Gangster is the rags to riches story of former drug king pen during the 70's Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington). After being a driver for 15 years for then Harlem king pin Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III) Bumpy dies leaving Lucas to take over his business . In a rather ballsy movie, he decides to eliminate the middle man (the mob) and buy the drugs from the war torn country of Vietnam himself. Now i personally have watched a load of films on drug trade and trafficking, usually finding a majority of them quite cool and somewhat fascinating, however there is nothing cool or fascinating about creating false bottoms and using the coffins of dead soldiers returning home from that dreadful war as ways of getting his product (heroin) into the U.S. in fact that was despicable. The other half of this tale comes to us in the form of broken down do gooder detective Ritchie Roberts (Russell Crowe) A cop who has, aside from a failed marriage, a bad time with his fellow officers after Roberts searches an abandoned vehicle and finding no less then 1 million in cash stowed away in it's trunk turns it in to his precinct as it was 'The decent thing to do'Robert's upon hearing smidgeons of information about the goings on of Frank Lucas decides to team up with a few of his fellow officers that he can still depend on to spend the rest of the film doing surveillance, wire taps etc to bring Lucas's drug empire to a halt. After watching this film i decided to research a little as i usually do during a real life event flick as to see how much was shinola. From what i read it seems that Scott's team did a pretty good job depicting the events around these two individuals lives however there is of coarse the usual fabrications...this is Hollywood remember? I enjoyed American Gangster immensely and think it deserves to be up on the movie shelf right alongside movies that are already there Goodfellas, The Godfather trilogy and Scarface.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
One of the essential American crime movies,"Excellent movie on all counts, a crime epic telling the early 1970's rise to power of Harlem drug kingpin Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) alongside detective Ritchie Roberts (Russell Crowe), the N.Y cop trying to nail him. I liked how both of these men followed moral codes, just on different sides.Directed by Ridley Scott, it's pretty much essential crime movie viewing, reminding me of 'Scarface' and up there with 'The Departed, Casino, Goodfellas, Carlito's Way, The Godfather, and Blow.' The story is well put together and absorbing although I'll admit to never being completely swept away, maybe because it didn't seem all that original. Still it's filled with atmosphere, style, a clever (interesting) plot. It's gritty, violent -but probably not as much as you'd expect, with excellent performances from Washington & Crowe.The cast is also a veritable who's-who and definitely part of the fun in seeing who will turn up next. (Armand Assante, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Common, Cuba Gooding Jr.,Idris Elba, Josh Brolin, Norman Reedus)There are a couple of brilliant scenes that definitely stand out here; Denzel walking up to Idris Elba in the middle of a busy street and showing all of Harlem who's in charge now, in a very violent and shocking way. Another favourite would be Crowe (and backup) waiting outside Sunday church for Denzel, its all very civil and beautifully shot. The final big bust is also awesome, tense, violent and chaotic. 4/20/15",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great actors and script but story was 10% true. Frank Lucas was violent beast,"Denzel and Russell could make Satan seem like he was just

Huge waste of time,"This movie was boring, long and drawn out. I will never again watch a movie with Denzel Washington in it. He has to be one of the most over rated actors of his time. Never have I seen a movie that had so much hype surrounding it and be such a snore on the screen. Usually these kinds of movies are at least semi entertaining. This one was nothing but a big bottle of sleep aid. Every time I kept thinking it was going to get better it just got worse. Russel Crowe was mildly entertaining but like Washington, lacked any believability in his character. I have seen many movies this year. If this one gets recognized for anything by the motion picture association it will be a huge miss carriage of justice to movies who truly deserve it as well as the actors who will be by passed for Washington. This movie deserves nothing. A huge waste of my time and money.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
One of the Best Gangster Movies Out There,"After his mentor is killed, ""Frank Lucas"" (Denzel Washington) decides to assume his former boss' place as the key drug dealer in Harlem. However, there are other drug lords who have also been waiting for this opportunity and they have decided to move into this territory as well. Because of that Frank takes a huge gamble and, rather than dealing with established middle men for his heroin, decides to procure his product directly from an original source-Thailand. This results in his being able to obtain pure heroin and cut it up to his own standards which happens to be of a better quality and for a cheaper price than anybody else can match in New York. Needless to say, this increases his customer base at the expense of the Mafia. And that doesn't make them very happy. It also increases his visibility to various law enforcement agencies for completely different reasons. Some want him off the streets while those more corrupt want to share in the profits. Regardless, a lot of people suddenly become interested in him and that means trouble-for everyone. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is one of the better drug-related movies out there with Denzel Washington performing in a very excellent manner. Russell Crowe (as ""Detective Richie Roberts"") also performs well but make no mistake-this is Denzel Washington's movie all the way. In any case, I enjoyed this movie and have rated it accordingly. Definitely above average.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Ended up being pretty darn good!,"I almost rated this movie lower but halfway through it became intense. The beginning was a little slow and felt like it had some unnecessary scenes, however it really started to pick up and it was amazing to see Denzel Washington act with his talent in a movie once again (I'm really glad that they did not underutilize him). It was also great at the end seeing him opposite from Russell Crowe, another awesome actor who has good characterization with his role too.

A Superior Gangster Film,"In the end it doesn't matter a lot how much of this film is true and how much is invented. Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), the smooth, elusive drug king pin, was real. Although there are notes at the end about ""where they are now,"" I don't know and don't care whether Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) was real or Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin), the shakedown artist, or Eva, Lucas's wife, played by the extraordinarily beautiful Lamari Nadal. What matters is that the story is masterfully told and directed with convincing attention to details by Ridley Scott.True, it's a long movie but I thought all the details and side stories served the plot very well, and the acting was excellent, particularly by Washington, Crowe, Brolin and Ruby Dee as Mama Lucas. Ms. Nadal wasn't given a lot to do other than to be beautiful but she accomplished that mission marvelously well.

Powerhouse performance by Washington.,"American gangster centres on crime lord Lucas ( Washington) rise to power through drug smuggling in NYC from abroad. He is also a man of philosophy and principle which is examined. On his tail is Richards ( Crowe) who also has his issues. Where this movie shines is the realism and the fleshing out of the story and all characters including a stellar support cast including Brolin, Gooding Jr and Asante just to mention a few. But Washington steals the show in a powerhouse performance that glues the film together. Realism is maintained at the expense of any sensationalism , but there is still enough violence and excitement to keep you on your toes. Eventually Lucas gives up corrupt police for a lighter sentence. This just falls short of "" great"" but is an excellent movie well directed by Ridley Scott. Worth more than one watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Opinion of a mob movie non-fan,"I do not, generally, enjoy movies about organized crime. Even the combination of Ridley Scott, Denzel Washington, and Russel Crowe did not entice me enough to lure me into the cinema for American Gangster. Although I now lament this missed opportunity, I have to say that the Collector's Edition DVD set was well worth the wait and the expense. Almost uniquely, the bonus features offer penetrating authentication of this essentially true story about the rise and decline of 1960s/1970s crime boss Frank Lucas (Washington) in Harlem.Opposite Lucas, and very interestingly mirrored by him throughout the film, is Essex County, New Jersey, policeman Richie Robertson (Crowe) a stalwartly honest cop who is waging a personal and professional war on drugs and corruption. The lives of the two protagonists are remarkably paralleled in the film, and the eventual culmination of the story will probably surprise those who are unfamiliar with the history of Lucas and Robertson. And the characterization (from top of the bill to the bottom) are excellent.Essentially, this is a heroic tale, but it is also a great deal more which I can not tell you about without writing a spoiler.The subject matter is decidedly not appropriate for young people. There are graphic scenes of heroin abuse and some rather cavalier treatments of human life which are affective and appropriate in contextualizing the subject of the film.The film is well directed, perfectly paced and casted, nicely edited and phenomenally well acted. Crowe and Washington reach their usual high standards, and Josh Brolin, Ruby Dee, Ted Levine, John Hawkes and Armand Assante provide great support.Unlike many films in this genre, action is very much subordinated to story and character development. In fact, action is actually given just a few quick minutes of screen time.Recommended for fans of Scott and the cast. Very highly recommended for fans of true crime drama.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Not the best of Denzel, Russell, or Ridley","I love director Ridley Scott, but this was not my favourite from him. I love Denzel Washington, but I felt that this was not his best film. I love Russell Crowe, but this wasn't a juicy role for him. I love gangster films, but this was not my favourite.So what can I say about a film that sometimes looks like a Harlem Sopranos, or has cliché TV announcer exposition through the early 70s. What stands out in this film that makes it unique? The story of Frank Lucas is kind of well known. Denzel is great in the role. Crowe is almost exactly in the era and location to be Serpico. No car chases, but otherwise has a ""French Connection"" quality to it (including a key scene). Did Ridley Scott want to de-emphasise production style for pedestrian docudrama? Did this movie not try hard enough to show a unique view of a well worn genre?I say.. guilty. Although competent acting gives this a positive rating from me, I can't recommend it for much else. Therein lies another drawback, the 2 1/2 hour running time. Something I believe is unjustified for - once again - lack of depth, in what we are supposed to feel for all involved. When Michael Mann makes a 2 1/2 hour movie (""Heat"", ""Insider"" with Crowe), I am drawn in through the third act. Here, it was not gripping me.So go for the stars, but don't expect to feel much pull into the material.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A solid gangster flick,"It isn't groundbreaking or special. But, American Gangster tells its story very convincingly. What I found to be very interesting was that even though it follows a very familiar formula, its characters aren't what you'd normally expect from these films.I found this story to be very interesting as it was one that I had never heard of. I also found it refreshing that a gangster movie didn't follow the typical Italian mobs. As such, this film had a completely different style than most gangster movies. Although familiar themes such as family and honesty were central, both themes were explored from a completely new perspective. For example, instead of relying on one's family because they are family, you rely on them because they are less likely to steal from you. Things like this made this movie stand out from most gangster films that I've seen. And although this isn't as good as something like Goodfellas, having those differences made it refreshing.Obviously, movies like this don't come without their problems. And while there are new perspectives in this one, its biggest problem is that it relies, perhaps a bit too heavily, on the typical formula that these films follow. Even if you aren't familiar with the story of Frank Lucas, as I wasn't, it doesn't take much to figure out where the film is going. But at the same time, as predictable as this formula might be, it is still a very effective one. American Gangster follows it to the t, making it its biggest downfall, as well as one of its biggest strengths.I have always struggled to review movies like this. In my reviews, I often talk about how a particular movie made me feel. Films like American Gangster rarely invoke any emotions in me. I can appreciate them for what they are, and I enjoy watching them, but they don't make me feel anything. And this one is no different. What it is, is a retelling of a crime story of epic proportions. And the movie does that very well. These are the types of movies that I'm happy that I have seen, but I probably won't watch them again for years.American Gangster is as good as any gangster movie, apart from the heavyweights like Goodfellas and The Godfather. But unlike these films, it tells the story of a completely different kind of gangster. Something that I, for one, gladly welcomed. And sure, it has its problems, but ultimately, it conveys its story in such a strong and effective way that it's easy to forget about those problems.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

They were 100% correct in saying so.The ""My man"" gif has become such a major meme and to see this in its actual context is actually terrifying since this happens just before a shoot out and drags the movie in a completely different direction.Russel Crowe being the manic detective and Washington being the stone cold and calm operator was great to see since most of the time these roles are reversed but works perfectly in this Gangster movieOverall i cannot wait to start the tv series in the next few days, lets roll back to Harlem!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Story of Frank Lucas,"Based on a true story, ""American Gangster"" tells us the story of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) who becomes most important importer of heroin on Manhattan, after the death of his mentor Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III). Lucas does that by buying heroin directly from the source in South East Asia and that is his cousin Nate (Roger Guenveur Smith). His product is superior to the one that is currently available on the street and his prices are lower. His alliance with the New York Mafia ensures his position and he also has to bribe some cops, especially Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin). Parallel with the story of Frank Lucas we also follow the story of Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), who seems to be only honest policeman.Ridley Scott directed this movie and I have to say that everything is made very good but I have a feeling that original version had 4 hours (just took one number) and that he had to cut a lot of scenes. There Scott gets lost, cause on one side he managed to create character of Frank Lucas completely and that is great, but on the other side almost every other characters suffer (especially Richie Roberts). And everything is perfectly made for Washington, but Crowe hasn't got much space to show his acting ability (which are great). Also some situations aren't explained completely. Like why is Cuba Gooding's character so little in this movie, after fight with Lucas he disappears. But what bothered me the most is that Lucas family just came to this big, new house without asking any questions. How did he get all that money and it is simply impossible that in his family, in short period of time, they all became killers and drug sellers.But if I put aside these things, we get one very well directed and acted movie (especially Washington) about a man who managed to became the king of drug scene and he wasn't Italian, but black. Also the character of Crowe is definitely only completely positive one (but only if we look his career in police). So ""American Gangster"" is solid movie from director Ridley Scott, but it isn't his best in my opinion. ""Gladiator"" is still my number one, but ""American Gangster"" isn't movie to avoid for every Scott fan.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Enjoyed it A LOT,"American gangster is close to 3 hours which is pretty long, but if you're going to make a movie that long it should be worth the time. I am glad to tell you that this movie is defiantly not a waste of time. The movie begins with Frank Lucas doing the dirty work for his boss and father figure called Bumpy. With the beginning starting like that we are thrown straight into the gangster world of Harlem. What I liked about this movie was that it gets us into the story nice and quickly. Fast pace of the movie slows down and then fast again, it's a bit like a roller-coaster. The movie shows the lives of 2 main characters who are Richie and Frank. Richie is a cop and Frank is the crook simple, but the FILM makes it very different and exciting. I have to say the acting was perfect and the script was well written. American gangster could be one of the best Gangster movie of all time, in my opinion I enjoyed it more than The Godfather and that's only MY OPINION! The only problem I had with the movie was that it should have shown Franks early life as a young child growing up. I think that's the only thing I did not like about this movie, other than that this movie was really good and you guys really should go pick it up. If your into gangster movies then it's a MUST SEE!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
The War on Drugs.,"The disambiguation ""war"" has been extracted from its traditional, historical context. This is particularly the case in politics.One might think about the War on Drugs, which Nixon called for in the early 1970s.And in this context, one might think that the politically instrumentalized use of the word ""war"" might be exaggerated.But ""American Gangster"" perfectly shows why this term was right: the massive drug abuse and the enrichment of those who benefit from the drug trade called for an all-out war against drugs.Here comes to play Frank Lucas, famous Harlem Drug Lord, as well as the newly-founded DEA, incorporated by the character played by Russell Crowe.Overtly fictionalized or not, the movie benefits from its well-drawn protagonists, it's slick soundtrack, as well as the fascinating historical context it so neatly portrays or even - one might say - imitates.Note: this movie was watched on 09.11.2024.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Good...But Not Great,"American Gangster is, without a doubt, a good movie. I wasn't bored but found a few annoying things about it. I got what I wanted though, two solid performances and a good story.Richie Roberts (Russel Crowe) is a cop who is going through a divorce and is in danger of losing custody of his son. He is seen as a boy scout to his corrupt colleagues, he turns in millions of dollars in a brief case to his authorities. Meanwhile we get the story of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), who rules the Harlem drug trafficking. Soon, Detective Roberts is assigned to bring down Lucas's criminal empire.I really found the consistent use of nudity annoying. Despite that, the film doesn't glamorize the life of a drug lord, it gives you gritty and sometimes horrific realism. It was good, but like I said it wasn't great. I doubt that crime fans will not be pleased, I most definitely was.The film also reveals things about drug trade that isn't shown in Scarface, which is seen as a definitive drug lord film. You see how they use there business relationships to make an empire. Lucas uses his relative's small businesses as fronts, just clever. It also shows how the dealer sees themselves, they see themselves as business men who will kill to get money and respect.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Ridley Scott's Under-appreciated Gem,"Compared to other movies by Scott, I believe this movie does not receive the credit it deserves. First of all, the movie features fantastic acting all around from Crowe, Washington, Brolin, and company. What I liked the most, however, was how the movie was directed. Ridley Scott's direction and the camera work is absolutely fantastic. I do not know how to describe it in words, but just the way each scene is portrayed through the lens makes the movie feel that much more lively and exciting. The running time is admittedly long, but I think most, if not all, would not mind that. Time will fly as you watch this modern crime classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Free market gangster style!,"American Gangster stars Denzel Washington as a crime lord Frank Lucas, and Russell Crowe as honest cop Richie Roberts. As the film opens Frank Roberts, a long time driver and confidant to a black New York Mob boss takes over the operation as the then boss dies unexpectedly. At that time, Frank was dealing with the New York Italian crime family serving as a middle-man in the distribution of a cut rate product (Heroine). Frank has an epiphany one day watching television, hearing of the drug problems prevalent amongst U.S. Soldiers serving in Viet Nam and Thailand. He enlists the help of a cousin (a soldier) stationed in Viet Nam to contact the Heroine supplier directly, hence cutting out the middle man (Italian mob). Quickly becoming the consummate businessman, enforcing a strict code of ethics and honesty and loyalty with-in the organization. Employing family he employs a no room for errors style of doing business. Richie Roberts is an anomaly, an honest cop swimming alone in a sea of corruption. He is quickly alienated by fellow officers when he turns over almost a million dollars he finds in the process of a bust. An law-abiding cop, he is soon enlisted by a federal drug task force to fight crime in the city. Meanwhile, the human side, his wife sues Richie for custody of his son. The reason, absenteeism. Too much time fighting crime, a dilemma for an honest man. Ultimately he accepts the position and leads the task force soliciting the help of other honest cops, the battle begins.This films theme; supply and demand, buying direct, cutting out the middleman and selling a superior product at discounted prices. Even in the world of drugs and thugs the lesson holds true, now and then. The film employs a variety of techniques successfully. Including; panoramic views of the city, and close up shots of action. Including direct and indirect sounds; trains, horns, steam emanating from the streets, and one that stood out in my mind. The sound of gas slowly poured it on a lost soul...the spark of a lighter...the sound of gas igniting...poof! Followed by a volley ofshots putting his victim to rest. The beginning of a great ride in thelife of New York Cities gangland.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
good but overrated movie,"I watched the movie because of its rating and cast (especially Danzel Washington) but that was it. From beginning till third quarter, pace of movie remained slow and even without much of the surprises. Almost same things kept repeating which made me feel bored. After third quarter, movie got some spice and pace. Ending of movie is good and justified. Now coming over to acting; Danzel has maintained high standards and performed really well. Besides that, other characters also displayed good acting skills. Instead of lengthening the movie at the cost of quality, it could have been kept short avoiding unnecessary fillers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great Ridley Scott mafia film and amazing performance by Denzel Washington,"Very nice (and violent) mafia film by Ridley Scott, focusing in real-life rise and fall of black mobster rooted in Harlem named Frank Lucas. The film is very well done, with good art direction and sets, nice dialogues, important discussion on police corruption, one of the best shooting scenes I have seen in a movie, rough scenes portraying drug addiction, well developed characters. Russel Crowe's Richie Roberts brings the interesting complexity of being the perfect honest and dedicated policeman who always do what is the correct in his job, while, at the same time, having a messy and irresponsible personal and family life. However, what makes the movie not being even better is precisely the importance of Richie for the story and the fact that the script emphasizes particularly the cat-and-mouse investigation by him of who is the big drug boss. I consider that, although Crowe worked correctly and his character is well written, the major strength of the movie lays elsewhere: what a magnificent performance by Denzel Washington as Frank Lucas! From coldness to anger, from intimidation to hidden hatred, Denzel Washington could deliver all that (depending on the moment the leading character was living), sometimes in very fast mood changes. That was a great work that deserved not to split so much attention with any parallel story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Good movie thanks to the actors and its direction, although plague by factual inaccuracies that very well can be bigotries.","It is sad that in the 21st century USA we use such a powerful art as movie making with inaccurate facts that can lead to racial hatred and bigotry.As always Denzel Washington, as well as the whole cast, brings an excellent performance to the screen and Ridley Scott's direction is superb. Oscar winning Steven Zaillian writing is the down side of the movie due to its misguided focus on ethnic role-play, unnecessary to the success of the story.The spectator should be aware that various significant facts - e.g. Frank ""Superfly"" Lucas' wife was not a Miss Puerto Rico pageant, that her name was not Eva Oquendo but Julie and that she went back to Puerto Rico (she served time)  in the movie are completely wrong.I wonder when we could reflect in screenplay write how lack of conscience, no qualms in using violence, social pressures, ethnic rejection and social isolation is the foundation to such true stories as the one of Frank Lucas. All prominent Puerto Ricans as well as African- American should stand up and let all of us know that you are the majority and that this story is of a ""minority"", not in terms of race but of percentages.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Ridley Scott is the man!,"Just finished watching American Gangster (2007) and this movie is another cinematic epic from Ridley Scott.Positives for American Gangster (2007):
This movie has one of the greatest ensemble cast I've seen in a long time which includes people like Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Josh Brolin, Ted Levine, Carla Gugino, John Ortiz, Cuba Gooding Jr., Idris Elba, Common, Norman Reedus, Roger Bart and Clarence Williams III. It also goes without saying that everyone all around gives phenomenal performances particularly Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. This is also one of those classic character-driven movies to where the main plot is the bonus and the real trick for the audience is getting to know the massive cast of characters. I also appreciated that Ridley Scott made this move a throwback to classic gangster movies like Good Fellas and the Godfather Trilogy. And finally, the movie earns its lengthy runtime because everything on screen is so compelling and complex that you need to pay attention to what is happening.Overall, American Gangster (2007) is one of the best movies from legendary filmmaker Ridley Scott and if you haven't seen it then you need to watch it as soon as possible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

I know if I'd been at the Cinema It would have been a bit of a slog. Was a bit cliche here and there. Borrowing a lot of character types and sub story interactions from other Gangster movies of the 90's. Which made it lack a little originality. Only nitpicking as the movie was well made, with Washington. Crowe and Brolin all impressive. Was exciting enough to keep you interested without being too sensationalised. Thought the sets and the general look of the movie was authentic and a good imitation of the era. The story wasn't over the top and felt like a reasonably accurate rehashing of the real story of Frank Lucas. Solid and entertaining while being rather sedate in its delivery. The pacing I feel suited a movie that was a semi biopic . Glad it never tried to sensationalise what was essentially a story about a violent criminal.

Denzel the Gangster.,"Dominic Cattano: ""Success. It?s got enemies. You can be successful and have enemies or you can be unsuccessful and have friends"".The story is about Frank Lucas, the quiet driver to one of the inner city's leading black crime bosses. But when his boss suddenly dies, Frank exploits the opening in the power structure to build his own empire and create his own version of the American Dream. Through ingenuity and a strict business ethic, he comes to rule the inner- city drug trade, flooding the streets with a purer product at a better price.They always comes a time in movies were I mostly get sucked in by the character's or story, and American Gangster does both right, because this is a flawless movie with spellbinding acting and brilliant directing.Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe both were absolutely outstanding in this movie. They both give a remember-able performance that gived their career a step up like never before. They both great actors who got talent all over them every time his one the screen.The director of this movie ""Ridley Scott"", which now his new films have been mostly okay or straight up boring and bad which sucks saying that because I know he can directed good movies just look at Gladiator, Blade Runner and Alien. But his directing in this movie was top notch brilliant and skillful with his shots and camera work.The story is interesting, the performance are top notch and the movie has pretty damn good soundtrack that I couldn't get out of my head.My only problems with the movie is the movie itself does slow down at parts for me.

Return to Form for Scott,"Ridley Scott has been a little off form recently. ""Kingdom of Heaven"" was a disappointment and ""A Good Year"" was very poorly received. He does remain one of the most prolific filmmakers working today and all you need do is look at his back catalogue and know there is faith that he can pull many more great films out of the hat. ""American Gangster"" rewards this faith.For the most part, this is a very fine thriller. It's gripping, quick and, despite a long running time, never dull. It features two actors at the top of their game. Denzel Washington's performance is electric and Russell Crowe is brilliant. A fine supporting cast, especially Josh Brolin, fill out the rest of the film with aplomb and they all exist in a wholly convincing world that Scott creates. All in all then, this is a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining film. However, the film is lifted higher by a thoroughly interesting social commentary that plays out in the background.Washington's Frank Lucas is a fine cinematic character. He is a family man, a devoted husband and a mass murderer and a drug lord. Crowe's Richie Roberts is a good man, but a flawed man, whose integrity casts him out of the corrupt police department. Here, a murderer and mass criminal climbs to a privileged and wealthy place in society, mainly due to the ignorance and prejudice of that society, whilst a good man and dedicated public servant lives out a fairly squalid experience.Scott's critique of the most successful capitalist culture is directed with vigour. The feel is frenetic and the look is superb. The sixties and seventies are evoked perfectly and the audience is utterly gripped. But the social comment, told with the aid of interesting and intelligent editing, shines through. Ultimately, a lot of this is due to the central performances. The scene where the two finally meet is brilliant and you simply cannot tear your eyes away from it.This film has lasting appeal. It's entertaining and intelligent. The two sides, the thriller and the commentary, sit well with each other, though the latter is lost occasionally, and this film is anything but dull but the real joy is seeing a film made by two actors and a director pretty much at the peak of their careers. It has the makings of a classic and, just as Scott is entering into a busy period, this can only be seen as more reason for faith in his ability.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Boring,"There is nothing about this film that would make me watch it again. Firstly, the plot. Frank Lucas (Washington), a black man from Harlem involved in organized crime imports pure Herion from Vietnam and makes a killing selling on the streets of New York City. He is a ruthless gangster which is capable of doing anything to defend his business. Enter Russell Crowe at Det. Richie Roberts, the vehemently honest cop who once handed back $1 million in unmarked bills that he found. Roberts heads up a special task force to find who is smuggling this pure heroin into the streets on the New York.That brief summation is basically all that is worth noting sans the ending. There's is some insight to Roberts' family, his womanizing, and divorce proceedings with his wife, which seems to have been included to fill time. There is no interesting character development, perhaps other than Lucas' mother, once full of praise for her boy finally faces the harsh truth about his life of crime. The performance's aren't that great either, there is just nothing in this script for them to work with. It seems that the writers had this potentially interesting story to tell but evidently no clue about how to tell it. Subsequently, the plot jumps around all over the place. ""Who's this guy Lucas' is beating up now? Pfft. Who cares""..is what was my eventual mind-set. Forgettable, really.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"not the best, but pretty good","There's a major problem doing a movie set in the 1970s, which was a period of major cultural transition. Many of the fashions of that day never went away; others were actually revivals from the 1950s. Still others came and went and then were later revived. I remark this because some reviews complain of the period detail in this film. But I have never seen a single film set in the 1970s anywhere true to that decade, which was the most memorably important of my life. So until someone can show me such a film, I just don't bother quibbling over the detail work set in that era.That said history, both real and cinematic are important here. The film opens remarking two events, each of which received attention in major films: from the mid-1930s, the Harlem underworld was dominated by Bumpy Johnson, who claimed to have retired in the late '40s, but this was not true, and remained mob boss above 125th Street until his death in the mid-'60s. His early career was depicted in the recent film ""Hoodlum,"" but he also appeared as a character (as 'Bumpy Jones') in the original ""Shaft."" Just about the same time, in the mid-'60s, a large quantity of heroin smuggled in from France was confiscated by an earnest NYC Detective, Eddie 'Popeye' Egan, which unfortunately did not lead to the mass convictions of narcotics-connected mobsters probably due to mob influence on the courts. This event was narrated in the film ""The French Connection."" The confiscated heroin itself disappeared thanks to corruption in the NYPD itself.Since Harlem was the big marketplace for illegal narcotics, it could be expected that these two stories would eventually intertwine; and that they did is documented in both texts of criminal investigators and reporters, as well as a number of fictional films from the 1970s; but this is the first film to tie the loose ends together. The sustaining element in both stories was the corruption in the police, the courts, and the government of New York, a problem that has never been completely resolved.American Gangster has to be judged as a recorded episode in this history, and it can be fairly compared with the movies previously mentioned. To be frank, it lacks the grand scope of ""Hoodlum"" and the energetic realism of ""The French Connection,"" but is on a par with some of the better films dealing with other aspects of this history - which it appears to reflect honestly, having both central players on board as consultants. It's not one of Ridley Scott's best movies, but it is a fascinating dual portrait of a shrewd hood running out of time and the honest cop hunting him down. Neither Washington nor Crowe are at their best here - I feel they needed more prep-time for their characters - but the turn in solid performances, as do the rest of the cast-members. And the work behind the camera is also solidly professional, as we've come to expect from director Scott's crews. But I admit I expected something a little more, since the core story and its history are so profoundly interesting, raising unsettling questions about American society and its particular economic culture. ( I can't remember in what movie a character explains that heroin is the perfect commodity, since its addicted consumers will spend any amount of money for it and get pretty much nothing in return.) So American Gangster is not the final statement on the continuing problem of the culture of narcotics or that of police corruption; but it is an interesting and entertaining gangster film, and a fairly reliable document of the events it portrays.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
American Gangster: A Gripping Gangster Tale with Familiar Echoes!,"Ridley Scott's ""American Gangster"" boasts a powerhouse cast and a meticulously recreated 1960s Harlem. Denzel Washington shines as Frank Lucas, a complex gangster who built an empire on ruthless efficiency. Russell Crowe delivers a compelling performance as Richie Roberts, the determined cop chasing him down.The film excels in its portrayal of the interconnected criminal underworld. We see both sides of the coin: Lucas' rise to power and Roberts' relentless pursuit. While the story explores class and societal issues, comparisons to ""Scarface"" feel overblown. This is a deeper exploration of morality, where even a ruthless criminal can be a family man and community figure.Despite its strengths, the film isn't flawless. Subplots like Cuba Gooding Jr.'s role feel unnecessary, and some plot points near the end strain credulity. However, the exceptional performances and Scott's masterful direction keep the momentum going. The climax is a powerful blend of action and human drama, devoid of unnecessary exaggeration.""American Gangster"" isn't entirely groundbreaking. The gangster film formula is familiar, but the execution is top-notch. It's a captivating crime drama that delves into the complexities of the criminal world and the men determined to navigate it.

'Ain't no love in the heart of the city...',"man was that trailer cool. Too bad the trailer is the best part about this movie.Saw this last night and the first thing you need to know is that its LOOOONG. No just long in that its 157 minutes, long in the way that you FEEL all of those 157 minutes. The pacing is so uneven and there are so many obviously unnecessary subplots (the women in Richie and Frank's lives especially) that I began to get annoyed at the running time even as the movie was still playing.The other glaring problem is the movie's apparent lack of social responsibility. Here you have a story that is set up to depict the rise to power of the first African-American gangster in U.S. history and the way Ridley treats him as a Jesus figure completely robs the movie of any moral complexity. They have one scene that cuts back and forth between Denzel having a pimptastic Thanksgiving dinner while his ""customers"" are shown overdosing in tenement buildings across Harlem. That's it. The rest of the time we're meant to believe that this guy who is responsible for spreading ultra-pure Heroin across the city is revered as some sort of messiah. Sorry, I just didn't buy it even if it is based on true events.The acting is good in a been there done that sort of way. We're so familiar with Russel and Denzel by now that we take them for granted and I don't think these characters were any real stretch for them. Josh Brolin steals the movie in every scene he's in as an unbelievably corrupt cop while Joe Morton's inexplicably blond mustache steals every frame that it is in.Won't get into spoilers but the ending is particularly troublesome with a very tidy conclusion that alters the real facts the whole movie is supposed to be based on.

'Everything a gangster film needs to be!',"American Gangster is a film that captivates from start to finish with its well-paced, tight storytelling. The plot moves smoothly without feeling rushed, keeping the tension high throughout. What I find particularly compelling is its unpredictability. Frank Lucas (played brilliantly by Denzel Washington) quietly builds a heroin empire, avoiding the flashy behavior you'd expect from a criminal. His eventual rise above the mafia is one of the film's standout aspects.The soundtrack, filled with '70s funk and soul (Across 110th street), perfectly enhances the atmosphere, immersing you in the era. But what truly makes the film shine is the character development. Both Lucas and Detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) are complex, believable characters, each facing moral dilemmas and evolving in their own ways.Overall, American Gangster is a smart and gripping crime drama and in my opinion everything a gangster film needs to be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Movie was good, but...","Story does't stick to real events and, like in many other movies, the villain is glorified somehow. I hate this... that a psychopath gets money (for his story) and also gets to be shown as a likable person.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Excellent,"There is many reasons why Denzel Washington I consider to be my favorite actor and he proved again here in this film. I've watched a lot of gangster movies but this movie had its own identity to it. I really enjoyed watching Frank Lucas helping out his family and putting them in positions to be successful even if it means their lives. Unlike some gangster movies, this movie lets get to know the characters on a deeper level especially with Frank Lucas. Even if the entire movie wasn't filled with as much action, I was still hooked through out the whole movie and I never felt bored at any moment watching this. Definitely recommend this movie and would watch it again",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Thinking man's gangster flick,"This is a rather long film but I never felt that it dragged. The emphasis is on the characters and the story as opposed to ""action"". Both main characters are well acted and have a lot of depth. Even Crowe of whom I'm not really a fan I very much liked his performance.The story itself is a very realistic, and in that sense mature, account of the rise and fall of a drug lord and the, for the most part parallel, yet in the end converging story of an honest cop.In conclusion, from the point of view of a character driven, story driven film, this is a high quality movie and very enjoyable if the subject matter doesn't repulse you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
One of the year's best!,"I've been wanting to see American Gangster since the moment I saw the trailer, it's good to see a film that actually looks very intelligent and also has a terrific and talented cast. I saw the film today with my mom and we were both just blown away with American Gangster. It is without a doubt one of the year's best films and I guarantee you that this will be on the nomination buzz for the Oscars. First off, we have an original Mafia movie finally, something that hasn't really been touched, an African American who had power and was just put as high as an Italian Mofia boss. I didn't have an idea that someone like Frank Lucas could have the power he had, because of American Gangster, I now have a little more knowledge of history and the crimes in the 70's. Frank Lucas showed what one man with a little determination could rise quickly, but also have to suffer the severe consequences of his actions. Despite how the rise and fall story is used so often, the cast and crew made American Gangster into a real film.Frank Lucas is an African American man growing in the world of the 70's in America. Drugs are becoming a hot commodity, or at least the good and pure kind of drugs that you can only get from Vietnam. When he hears about this, he heads over there and makes a deal with the drug lord, he manages to bring in 2,000 kilos into the United States! He's now a popular customer there and in America, he's living the high life. He moves his family into a gorgeous mansion, he gets a beautiful Puerto Rican wife, and is respected by most of the community. He's never even suspected of anything, that is until his wife gives him a coat that stands out quite a bit in a crowd, and he is photographed by Detective Richie Roberts. Roberts is now on Lucas's case and has problems of his own, over half of his team is being bribed by drug dealers, and he's under the same pressure to just give into temptation of a bribe.American Gangster is the best Mofia movie this year, I promise you. It's a fantastic film and has just flawless performances. I wouldn't be surprised if Denzel Washington will be nominated for a best performance award. His performance as Frank was so brilliant, he was scary, yet smooth, unpredictable, yet charismatic. He couldn't have played it better. Russell is riding on the roller coaster of great performances this year, he's not as powerful as Denzel, but he stands great on his own in American Gangster. Ridley Scott, our director, has proved that he can handle the Mofia genre, he handled the film with utter perfection and this is his best film in years. American Gangster actually surpassed my expectations, I definitely do recommend this movie, it's a great one.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Misguided Marketing Murders 'American Gangster',"The Oscar buzz surrounding the highly anticipated Ridley Scott movie American Gangster is ostensibly doing the production plenty of favors. Rarely is a movie slated to be released in November the beneficiary of such publicity and fanfare.Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment will likely be pleased with the opening weekend returns if the preceding publicity translates to box office performance.Unfortunately, the word of mouth that is likely to spread subsequent to opening weekend will not be as favorable as the hype will have you believeand that's not necessarily a failure on the part of the movie, but more a function of misdirected marketing by the producing companies involved.By now all of us have had the opportunity to see the movie trailer for American Gangster, one that is very specific in its depiction of what to expect come November 2.Despite what the movie trailer suggests, American Gangster is NOT a violent, ""action"" movie. It has some flurries of violent hyperactivity, but the OTHER 2 hours of non-action make a stronger argument for characterization as anything BUT an ""action"" movie. In fact, the movie has less violence overall than any movie with ""Gangster"" in its title should be allowed to have.The violence and action are reasonable expectations too. Drugs, mafia, guns and the depiction of murder all line the trailer of a movie with ""Gangster"" in the title. One would think that's an invitation for classic, violent ""gangster"" cinema.But trust Mo'Kellythis is NOT an action movie and in many ways completely divorced from the ""gangster"" genre. If you attend this movie expecting something akin to Casino, Goodfellas, or any of the cookie-cutter urban dramas, you'll be thoroughly disappointed.But it's not necessarily your faultor the movie's for that matter. You're being misled.This cinematic story of Frank Lucas tells of a cerebral criminal mastermind. Lucas is portrayed in this film as exceptionally reasoned, measured and intellectually resourceful in a way that is more powerful than any gun wielded by his nemeses.The movie American Gangster is true in that sense to its introspective protagonist. It is more descriptive of the internal conflict between Lucas' Christian/family values upbringing and his desire to live the American Dream. Accordingly, Scott spends over 2.5 hours in his attempt to give his viewers a glimpse more into the ""mastermind"" as opposed to ""criminal"" portion of the ""criminal mastermind"" equation.Unfortunately, the trailer suggests the exact oppositeand that could (and likely will be) disastrous.Specifically, the storyline is loosely based on the life and criminal career of a Harlem heroin kingpin who rose and fell concurrently to American involvement in Vietnam.For those who know their New York drug kingpin cinema history, the movie New Jack City (1991) was a thinly veiled reference to the criminal exploits of another Harlem drug lord and Lucas contemporary; Leroy ""Nicky"" Barnes.The American Gangster parallels to New Jack City are inescapable given their shared elements in a historical and cinematic sense. (New Jack City was a fictitious account of the emergence of crack, whereas Barnes and Lucas were responsible for the influx of high-grade heroin) When moviegoers finally sit down for American Gangster, they've most likely seen New Jack City. Although NJC is set in a period later than American Gangster; since it borrows its storyline from the heroin drug trade of the 60s, there will be elements in American Gangster that will reek eerily familiar if not seem ""copied"" from NJC. Without a thorough understanding of the historical contexts of both movies, American Gangster will in many ways be wrongly construed as a ""copy"" of NJC. In actuality, AG is more accurate and honest in its depiction of the drug trade than its wholly fictitious counterpart of yesteryear.But back to the Oscar hype Academy Award winners Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe do well in their respective roles, yet given the fact that both have a slew of films with truly stellar performances in which to compare American Gangster; it makes you wonder where the buzz originates.Denzel Washington's portrayal of Frank Lucas is not as engaging as his Malcolm X, not as incredible as his Reuben ""Hurricane"" Carter or even as evil as the corrupt detective Alonzo in Training Day. We know when we see the ""best"" of Denzel Washington and it is readily identifiable.This is simply not it...through no fault of his own. He's an actor who's made a career of ""cerebral characters."" A ""cerebral gangster"" simply does not provide the platform for Washington to show the range and depth we already know he's capable of displaying. ""Frank Lucas"" is a ""Denzel,"" we're all intimately familiar with and thus less than ""Oscar-worthy."" Denzel has raised the bar far higher in other performances and this fact can't be ignored in any truthful commentary about his latest effort.As for Russell Crowe, copy and paste the previous paragraph and substitute Crowe's information accordingly. After seeing Crowe at his best in The Insider and A Beautiful Mind, it's a bit disingenuous to argue that his portrayal of Detective Richie Roberts is worthy of comparison or similar acclaim. Again, it's not dismissing Crowe's contribution, but this role simply did not require any heavy liftingheavy lifting we know Crowe's capable of handling.In the end, American Gangster does not measure up to the hype. The blame should go more to the Universal Pictures marketing department and less to director Ridley Scott. People turning out will presumably expect to see lots of violence and action surrounding the life of a high-powered drug lord. Instead, they will find they've spent their money on a biopic of an introspective family man with flashes of the aforementioned.American Gangster is neither a great movie nor a bad one. It's just ""a movie."" Combine this with a misdirected marketing campaign and you have the classic recipe for movie-buyer-remorse.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Simply the best movie of the year,"Based on a true story, American Gangster is so far the best movie I have seen since ""the Departed"". Denzel Washington, at his best as usual, teamed up with Russel Crowe who delivered an Oscar-worthy performance. Interestingly, the supporting cast were all phenomenal specially Armand Assante, who played the Italian mob. Like ""the Departed"" did for Martin Scorsese, this movie might bring Oscar to Ridley Scott who has three Academy Award nominations for the best director (Thelma and Louise, the Gladiator, and Black Hawk Down) under his belt. The only problem is that the theme of the movie is similar to ""Departed"" and it is unprecedented that the same type of genre wins two-year in a row. The same happened to ""Babel"" which in my opinion was very close if not better than the Academy-Award-winner ""Crash"" but came one year after and did not win although nominated for several Oscars. Unlike ""Scarface"" and ""God Father Trilogy"", it does not contain lots of action scenes and gun shots but it is far more than that. It is a well-depicted tale of a loyal protégé who became one of the most successful heroin dealers in the US and a devoted NARC who went after him despite of the odds fighting the corrupt NY police system. The bottom line is, this movie will be nominated for multiple Oscars this year and do not be surprised if Denzel or Russell get there second golden statue. This movie is great, skillfully directed, perfectly performed, and simply is the best movie of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Frank Lucas, the gangster who means business... literally.","""Every gangster's downfall will be his false sense of invincibility""I found that quote in a Youtube comment from the clip showing Frank Lucas' arrest and that it belongs to notorious mobster Carmine Galante who ended up shot in his favorite restaurant, gives it such an eerily prophetic dimension it can work as a mantra of the gangster genre.They all start with a fascination for the gangster-figure and end with the realization that sooner or later, wings get burned.""Goodfellas"", ""Scarface"", ""Casino"" etc. all follow that arc and even ""The Godfather"" if you consider the sequels, providing the perfect canvas for a captivating character studies. And as Lucas, Denzel Washington, intimidating in all calculated smoothness, encapsulates the 'initial reaction', exuding the kind of macho appeal we secretly long for in our boring and compromising lives like Pacino, De Niro or from the old days Cagney and Robinson.It's a timeless story rooted in any decade of America's contemporary history, a gangster makes his bones, expands his territory, earning many friends, a few enemies and the dreamgirl. Gangster films are the antithesis of fairy tales for they have a happy beginning and all build up for the downfall that might come from greed, human mistakes, ambition, betrayal, sometimes even principles... there's always a price to pay. Lucas could keep his fortune and quit drug business while he was at the top, he chose to move on, ego was his downfall but he had understandable motives that show that gangsters storylines aren't schematic for the sake of it.The genre is perhaps the best social commentator to the American dream, the irony that a man had to use capitalistic methods to reign over Harlem and restore order. He might be a killer and a heroin dealer, Lucas is a visionary businessman who learned from the 'best'. While Scorsese's films feature flawed characters, ""American Gangster"" is closer to ""The Godfather"" in its depiction of a brilliant man who took the wrong direction: a good manager whose ""my man"" catchphrase resonates as Brando's offer one can't refuse, so when it's time to get off the cover and pull the trigger, he won't hesitate. One of the most memorable scenes have him kill a rival in broad daylight and it's not much the boldness of the move than the certitude that no one will snitch on him.Ridley Scott's biography of Frank Lucas' life accomplishes something I didn't think was possible, combining many elements of the gangster genre that, taken alone, would've been enough to make a great film. First mention to the organizational aspect: the death of Bumpy Johnson left Harlem chaotic and comforted the Italian mafia couldn't keep control. Lucas understands the necessity of leadership and in all admirable pragmatism, decides to sell a better product at a lower price, and the Vietnam war offers a perfect cover to smuggle heroin directly from the main source. On its own, his success is a marketing school-case enhanced by a memorable moment where he lectures a big customer (Cuba Gooding Jr.) on the value of brand and merchandising.Another value that plays a key role in the film is family. Lucas isn't a womanizer, he believes in family ties, gives jobs to his relatives, buys a house for his mother (Ruby Dee), gets married and shares a Happy Thanksgiving dinner with everyone. But ike in ""The Godfather"", family is a double-edged sword as Lucas owes the most of his troubles to screw-ups from his relatives, including his nephew (Chewitel Ejiofor) and to counterbalance these effects, the crowning moment belongs to little Mama Lucas who prevents Frank from killing a corrupt cop (played by Josh Brolin) because even she knew it was personal and her angst toward her son spoke in subtext: ""this has nothing to do with business!"" Dee deserved her Oscar nomination for that scene alone.And I guess Washington (who was perfect) was snubbed because we've seen a lot of that before, ""The Departed"" was still fresh in memories and other titles keep popping when you watch one scene or another: Lucas asking his nephew to keep a low-profile and not to be too loud fashion-wise channeled De Niro's warning after the Lufthansa heist in ""Goodfellas"", Lucas' shooting a man on the forehead being his ""defining"" moment echoed the restaurant scene when Michael shoots Sollozo. Still, the most significant parallel is the climax, set in a church where Lucas is sitting with his wife and mother intercut with shots where cops arrest the family members. The baptism was Michael's rise, the mass isn't much Lucas' downfall but the cops' triumph as the film isn't just about criminals but about the law. The film is both ""The Godfather"" and ""The French Connection"".Though it occupies one tenth of this review, half the film belongs to the investigation lead by Richie Roberts, Russell Crowe as a cop who ostracized himself after refusing to keep a million dollar found in a car. It's only fair for a gangster reminding of Michael Corleone to have a ""Serpico"" against him. And I loved the way the film patiently waited for their two paths to converge at the conclusion and have them talk about a simple concept: ""the right thing"". A brilliant man did horrific things and lead a happy life (though briefly), a man acted straight and lived miserable. Lucas was a criminal but a self-made man, Richie served the law but without any reward whatsoever.Washington and Crowe magnificently embody the contradictions of the American dream, making for a multilayered story of men acting according to their beliefs for right or wrong. It's easy of course to root for Roberts, as for Lucas, I guess all you've got to do is listen carefully to the lyrics of ""Across the 110th Street"", the song says everything, speaking from Harlem's heart of darkness, from the 'soul' before passing the torch to rap music at the end of the film... when Lucas was history already.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Ground control to Ridley Scott? Do you read? Come in Ridley Scott!? Hollywood, we have a problem!","Just saw the new Ridley Scott movie American Gangster. IMDb.com has it rated at 8.2/10 but I just don't get it. I remember when Scorseses Gangs of New York came out. I just could not wait to see it. Man, did that movie bomb. And damn did American Gangster disappoint too. It's not that the casting and acting was bad. Actually they were both great. It was the direction and the storytelling that lacked big time. At no time during the nearly 3 hours the movie played did I connect with any of the characters. It was like a summary of a 'true story'. There were some promising bits in the movie that could have made this a much better experience, but it never delivered. Yes, I was entertained for nearly 3 hours but I was also entertained by the movie Shoot 'm up, maybe even more. The only reason I would rate American Gangster higher is the powerhouse cast. That and the bad direction is the only thing that stands out. Ridley, please don't miss twice in a row like Scorsese did with his two gangster movies: Gangs of New York and The Departed (which only won an Oscar because Scorsese was overdue for one). The Ridley Scoot that I knew: Blade Runner, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Kingdom of Heaven, The Company, (and I could go on, but I won't do that because it will ruin his track record), was the guru film director, the Yoda of movies, the godfather of cinema. Now he has straid from the path and has now become a mediocre director. Please find your way back. Preferably before your next movie, please.

The Crowe and The Washington rule in this great Scott American Classic!,"Frank Lucas was a real true to form American Gangster. Detective Robbie Roberts was a real true to form American Cop-Master. The true story of the grueling process on the evolution, execution, and resolution on how Roberts pinned Lucas is revealed in the masterful Director Ridley Scott film ""American Gangster"". Denzel Washington stars as Lucas, a 1970's black American Kingpin who builds a drug empire by smuggling heroin in coffins of dead soldiers from the Far East. Russell Crowe also stars as Roberts, the righteous lawful detective who heads up an undercover-angel law enforcement team whose master plan is to be ""frank"", nail Frank! The great Scott masterfully orchestrates the film as a two-sided good cop/bad gangster symphony; you got Lucas up-rise to gangster notoriety as one story and Mister Roberts passionate determinative quest to nail the American Gangster in the other. Crowe and Washington do not even share screen time together until the film's final chapter. Though this is ultimately a cerebral tale of a cat-and-mouse chase of a law-biding cop's mission to nail down an egoistic hoodlum, the film's major theme that is investigated is police corruption. Crowe and Washington were, not surprisingly, brilliant as Lucas and Roberts. The supporting acting gang of ""American Gangster"" also did show their true good enforcement acting colors: Josh Brolin was wickedly conniving as crooked Detective Trupo, Chiwetel Ejiofor was a hoot as Frank's brother Huey Lucas, Ruby Dee was divine as Mama Lucas, and Cuba Gooding Jr. still showed us the acting as Kingpin competitor Nicky Barnes.

The catch occurs when a cop named Richie Roberts loses his partner to Lucas' high-grade product and the straight Roberts now goes on a personal quest of vengeance to get Lucas and clean the streets.

Causal ambiguity,"If a top classic movie is made, it is often unsure how this came about. That is, if all the right disciplines do all the right things this is just not enough. The positioning and interaction of these elements is what makes a true classic, so if for (a simple) example a camera move is followed by a shift in the story and the characters at the same time, you have an enhanced experience. It is more often than not the case that filmmakers are not aware how they made these interactions work. This causal ambiguity also explains why it is impossible to replicate just another classic by the same or different film makers. A top director is however more aware than the average ones of these interactions and often exercises a far larger control over the total work that in these days have turned into gigantic, almost non-manageable projects. The late Kubrick comes to mind as the genius and control freak in this regard, and he also let his movies evolve, thus avoiding the trap of rigidities and able to adjust the interactions.Ridley Scott is one of the top directors of our time. American Gangster contains dozens of interesting shots and perfect location shooting and set building. Ridley Scott makes every scene worth looking at in itself. The apartments in a dilapidated neighborhood looking like prisons, the framing of the first shots (those with Bumpy) and the last shot in the transfer of one area into another, the many references to other (gangster) movies (Scarface, Goodfellas for example) are examples of his great talent. Also in storytelling, he refrains from presenting the story in a simple manner and let us work to combine some of the pieces.But the story and especially the script is far too linear for Scott's talent. In Gladiator he could expand on the notion of the arena as a theater, in Matchstick Men he could play with the audience in tricking them in a movie about tricks, in Kingdom of Heaven he could link it to the Islam-Christianity dichotomy. But here, there are just some loose elements like Vietnam, drug-addicted NY neighborhoods and a black imitating Italians. Steven Zaillian's script is just badly written, not able to make this story work beyond the obvious and also contains some unnecessary elements that detract from the story (the love story for example. Next to this I find it hard to believe that this was edited by Pietro Scalia, who did the fantastic editing in Black Hawk Down and Gladiator.Denzel Washington has never topped his performance in Training Day and is unable to do something extra for this movie; Russell Crowe tries to replicate his performance from A Beautiful Mind, and both are also not able to surpass the limitations of a weak script. American Gangster contains luckily an enormous amount of side roles that are true revelations.So in the end American Gangster is in itself a decent movie, but pales in comparison to the movies it tries to build on, such as Goodfellas/Casino, Cidade de Deus and The Godfather.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Shocking yet great!,"It's been a while since I saw a movie that good - at least in that column of genres. I want to let you know that all these rumors like ""just another mediocre movie"" are too subjectively driven.The trailer was cut to together very professional, I grant, so you'll watch American Gangster having high expectations to it. So did I. Still, I have not been disappointed. My expectations have even been overshot. The atmosphere catches you beginning with the first minutes and keeps you in your seat tight until the end (for those who after around 150 minutes runtime still cant get enough, wait until the credits played through - you will be rewarded with a few extra frames). Historically, it is kept close to the happenings; just extended by some scenes / additional content for the big screen which is totally legitimate to me.American Gangster gives you an insight view of the personal life of the gangster Frank Lucas, the way he dealt with his family and his relationship with Eva - Denzel, a real gentleman. During the movie he develops a very nice and human character which is yet to be unsettled big from time to time. Hence, the movie was done the right way. Actors fit perfectly to the person they embody: Denzel was simply great, Crowe, of course, too. I had some trouble accepting Crowe as a cop (after watching 3:10 to Juma recently), which however abated after a time. The way the setting of the 1970's was reproduced is incredible: Details everywhere - just mind-blowing. If there was the possibility to sense this movie more intense I wouldn't hesitate to do so. Additionally, I want to point at the sound: it was awesome! I am sort of a person only able to enjoy movies entirely when they are set to music on a high standard which is necessary to really develop a comprehensive atmosphere.Since there is nothing left to say (from my end at least), I hope this comment was helpful to those who are not sure about which title to choose the next time going to the movies.

Mediocre,"I am afraid I am borrowing views expressed in some of the other crits: This film borrows extensively from classics as The Godfather, The French Connection, Scarface and even Apocalypse Now but it comes nowhere near any of them. The acting is not bad but I have a problem with the development of the central character, Frank Lucas. He appears to have some principles but quickly embarks on the narcotics trade, cares not who else it might affect, and does not think twice about executing a competitor in public. Lucas kissing his brother on the mouth and later beating him up smacked of The Godfather Part II relationship between Pacino and Cazale but it did not come across anywhere near as viscerally. In the end, just so that he does not spend the rest of his life in jail he is willing and reptilian enough to turn in all those that he bribed and that served him. Perhaps his flaws are only human but I care more for a mad bugger like Tony Montana in Scarface than for this cold-hearted kingpin that uses national institutions such as the US Army for personal gain and should face high treason but instead skulks away with a reduced jail term as if that were ennobling and worthy of 157 minutes of film. Russell Crowe comes across more credibly as a copper who places job before family but real life has its ironies and I did not think a honest man like him would become a defense lawyer whose first client would be... Frank Lucas. Ridley Scott's direction lacks verve and inventiveness and it rambles here and there, especially when Lucas' family comes into the picture. The period detail is adequate though I have seen better. The cinematography is of tolerable quality (I have watched more polished TV productions). Finally, the screenplay is a patchwork of clichés I would not have wanted my name associated with. This is a big production movie with big stars to match with the aim of doing well at the box office, and I am sorry I paid hard earned money for this product thereby indirectly helping maintain this industry that treats spectators like so many sheep. American Gangster is mediocre film-making, its moral values are dire, and the lesson I gleaned was an old one: As long as you have money and connections you can get away with murder.

"Great film, don't see what all the fuss is about.","I got exactly what I expected - a really good, not masterful, but really good gangster film from Ridley Scott, one of my favorite directors. American Gangster is definitely long but I still feel like the editing was great...they packed so much information into a two and a half hour movie. It was fulfilling. They did a great job of capturing the era and the attention to detail was great - and I don't mean they just played funk music. Shots of old TV's with news on Vietnam, cars, everything. The production of this movie wasn't lazy at all. The acting was what I expected, great. Denzel Washington does get some heat for playing similar characters in every movie, but I say oh well, he is very good at playing this kind of role.

"It's not about Russel Crowe nor Denzel Washington, it's all about Ridley Scott","In my opinion I think American Gangster is one of Ridley Scott's finest works if not the best, well, some thing very bad already happened to this movie though, it is Martin Scorsese's The Departed winning last year best picture and best director in particular on the same kind of work.I think Ridley Scott has already booked a spot in the best director contest, he can control the camera like no other, you can get every teeny tiny detail from what your are watching thanks only to him, he managed to get some details about a very critical period of the American history using a very descent manner focusing on drugs and society, I gotta say I never heard of Frank Lucas before but as you are watching you can get that feeling of knowing him for a long time. And by the way the film editing was great too.The acting was fantastic, Denzel Washington is really a bad ass guy, but deep inside he is a good hearted family man, showing that when dealing with his wife, his brothers and his mother, he was really great, however Russel Crowe was controlled by the role he played, this role is a recipe for a great supporting role; being a confused cop who can't focus on his job because of his family; but I don't think Russel Crowe was prepared enough for supporting roles, nonetheless he did a very fine job.Saying that I don't think the actors performances will get Oscar nominations, instead I think two persons in particular could get nominations:Steven Zaillian: for his sharp and smart script. And of course Ridley Scott for this great achievement.Although the drug matter has become a usual subject lately but Ridley Scott can always come up with something new about every movie he direct.10/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
American Gangster is an Instant American Classic.,"I know we've seen all of this before, rise and fall of the American gangsters, it was done beautifully and seen through the lens of Martin Scorsese in Goodfellas and the lens of Brian De Palma in Scarface, but what's great about American Gangster, is that now we get to look at it through the lens of Ridley Scott, and what a great look it is.What's great about American Gangster is that it is different to the two movies it has the biggest connections, again, Goodfellas and Scarface. American Gangster manages to stay away from pretty much everything you would expect, and gives you a fresh, new perspective into some very interesting leading characters, Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts, played brilliantly, as one would expect from such greats of greats, Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, but more on their performances later.Ridley Scott has always been an interesting director, and this reviewer has always found his work interesting. I certainly had high expectations with this movie, and though those particular expectations were not met, I was pleased by a whole different film I had no idea I was about to watch.With a movie like this, I was sort of expecting a fun gangster movie, most gangster movies are fun, we all know that, it was fun to see Joe Pesci be an unpredictable pig of a wise guy, it was fun to watch Al Pacino sprouting all those four letter words, shooting and introducing us to his ""little friend"". With a gangster movie, you expect that sort of thing, but Ridley Scott gave this material a whole new spin, he turned into a gritty, 70s type drama, with real characters, historically significant circumstances, and a fantastic realistic meets Hollywood approach. It was fun but in a different, unexpected way.You can definitely feel the touch of the European style of directing that has always made Ridley Scott an interesting director. His direction is sober, straightforward, and rather innovative for the genre, this film does not look like any gangster movie, no operatic feeling like The Godfather, no kitsch like material like in Scarface, and no rhythmic editing and skillful sequence shots like Goodfellas, this is a unique movie in terms of style and narrative.The story is not about a flashy and dangerously like-able gangster and the ""untouchable"" goody good cop out to catch him, the story is much deeper, dealing with US involvement in Vietnam, corruption on law enforcement agencies, and the dramas of imperfect men and women caught in all this turmoil.The cinematography by Harris Savides is very good, the film has a great look, it heathens the gritty scenarios sometimes portrayed in the film with a blurry feeling that enhances the feeling of the movie. The editing by Scott's old ally Pietro Scalia is flawless as one could expect from such a consummated editor, and the subtle attention to detail in the art department is great. Along with a realistic costume design by Janty Yates.The film is not a biopic of Frank Lucas, or of Richie Roberts, it's about the clashing of these two men, and that could not have been orchestrated better by Scott and Brian Grazer the producer, for getting both Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe to meet face to face on an acting duet that slowly, patiently builds up to a great showdown. It can be compared with Michael Mann's crime epic Heat, and it's Pacino/De Niro showdown. Both Denzel and Washington carry the movie with amazing skill, it's a thrill to follow both story lines because of the two actors that carry them, developing the characters into rich, detailed personifications of the real men behind the story.The supporting cast of numerous familiar faces such as Carla Gugino, Armand Assante, Ted Levine, Joe Morton, Josh Brolin, Ric Young, Cuba Gooding Jr. and the surprising Ruby Dee in an Oscar nominated Supporting Performance, they all make the canvass of the movie feel even richer.Now, this movie has been played down for not being memorable and exciting as other gangster films, but that detachment from classic gangster movies is what makes it exciting, cause it's not familiar territory, just as Goodfellas was great for being different from The Godfather, American Gangster is great for being different to gangster movies of it's sort, and taking us to new, unexplored territory.Big congratulations to Ridley Scott for proving he is still a master of the craft, and for the two male leads, Denzel and Crowe, for giving us great performances. This American Gangster is one big American Classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

He is smooth and very friendly on the outside, yet adhering to ruthless business tactics on the inside.The movie deals with Lucas doing it all and doing it very well indeed. The New York drug trade is covered completely by him as he sells his stuff at higher purity and lower cost than anyone else. He manages to get in the drugs inside the coffins of American casualties, which is apparently based on fact. It's all very interesting how he turns the business practises around.Lucas is not the quintessential gangster and sports absolutely no rings on his fingers, no scantily clad women lounging in his pad and loud cars. Nope, he is the quiet demure businessman with a very low key approach. He is even married. And all that makes it very difficult for the authorities to figure out who he is.Lucas's stubborn antagonist is a police detective named Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe). He does a very bad thing that gets him on the bad side of the rest of the officers in his police department. He finds $1 million in drug money and turns it in. The rest of the boys in blue are mad as hell because they expected it to be shared out.Roberts doggedly pursues Lucas while maintaining his ethical standards. He carefully builds up his case against Lucas ensuring an airtight offencive. He vows to bring down Frank Lucas and succeeds. When Lucas is caught he is worth more than $150 million but manages to reduce his sentence by cutting a deal to expose three-quarters of the NYPD narcotics officers as corrupt.Nobody especially the police like what is going on. It's not good for their living. They all get into Roberts's way.This is a deeply engrossing story that flows very smoothly and develops the characters accordingly.

It's Been Done To Death And Much Better Too By Italians,"You'd think a film based on the true story of how America got swamped by heroin would be a totally compelling piece of cinema wouldn't you ? So would I and yet before tonight I'd seen this movie twice and after seeing it for a third ( Make that a final time )I've found it a very unengaging and unmemorable movie and I've never been able to put my finger on as to why ?Ah now I know . I've been reading through the comments pages and the same names keep cropping up - Scorsese , DePalma , Coppola and Mann . Directors who have made a name for themselves by directing gangster movies . Maybe Ridley Scott is the wrong choice for director but no doubt he was trying to break away from the corner he'd painted himself in to by continually directing historical epics . The irony is that Scott fails to bring a sense of time and place . It's not enough to play the Spencer Davis Group as people walk down a steamy American street in slow motion . A film with this type of setting is crying out for a New Hollywood brat like Scorsese to bring it to life . Scott merely gives it artificial respirationThat said Ridley Scott isn't helped by the popular culture we live in . This type of story has been done to death . An American gangster film has a fatherless figure pursue the American dream through criminal means only to find that the dream becomes a nightmare and it costs them everything .

Good Film With Too Much Hype,"Now first and foremost don't get me wrong, it was a very good movie. IF you are expecting this to be a Godfather/Scareface/GoodFellas, think again. This movie is longer than it needed to be, and it wasn't as much of a edge-of-your-seat moment at times as you would believe it to be. I personally love mob movies, but don't think this ranks as number 1. Denzel yet again does a splendid job in his role as Frank (as if it was skeptical) and Russel Crowe adds a good character into the mix. When it comes down to it, the acting was great, length was too long, plot was good, movie was good, but in my mind the hype and the excpectance of it was too high. If your expecting this to be one of the best movies of the year, still watch it, but don't get your hopes up.

Decent easy-watch with a great score and questionable character development,"Doesn't really feel like the 60s:
At no point does this movie really transport you to the time it's discussing. The costumes occasionally remind us that suits were a bit bigger and that men had moustaches but the language used and everything about the setting makes it feel like it could've happened in 2007. This comes across as part of a wider problem of this feeling like a generic, timeless, cop anti-hero vs. Criminal anti-hero that we've been seeing a lot since Heat (1995).Trying to make a heroin dealer seem like a good guy
Although Frank Lucas's demise is the ultimate goal of Richie Roberts, he barely feels like the antagonist because of his own characterisation and the inclusion of Brolin's Trupo. Trupo is the real antagonist of this movie which feels odd given that Lucas is a deluded thug who thinks he has earned Harlem's loyalty by killing half the community with heroin. He is constantly depicted as a classy, principled and loyal family-oriented man. Maybe Frank Lucas was a great guy at his core but if he sold extremely pure heroin to his own community I really doubt that he was. The scenes towards the end where Lucas collaborated with Roberts to bring down the corrupt cops are depicted as two powerful anti-heroes bringing down the real bad guys instead of showing the reality of a desperately depraved man trying to win back some years. It's telling that Ridley Scott would film Robin Hood 3 years later because he was clearly already chomping to tell this type of story in 2007. Unfortunately, Robin Hood didn't get Nottingham hooked on smack.There are only 3 characters, everyone else is completely invisible:
There are essentially 3 characters in this film: Roberts, Trupo and Lucas. Every other character is invisible to the point of being unnecessary to include them. You will not walk away from this movie remembering the names of any of those three characters' entourage. Yet just enough backstory is given to them to make the film stray from the three real characters too much. Lucas's brothers and cousins are paper thin caricatures of plucky yes-men. Similarly, we are expected to give Roberts' crew the reverence of ""these are the best guys"" without giving us a compelling reason why. Lucas is the most in-depth portrayal in the movie and Washington delivers this with plenty of class and fear-inducing commitment. Crowe's Roberts doesn't go much beyond the average ""good cop that does bad things"" trope. Broken does a good job at making us hate Trupo, despite much less screen time than the other two.Score:
The score is an absolute highlight of this overall decent movie. Marc Streitenfeld shines with his fascinating sounds that blend the tense territorial atmosphere of Harlem against the fierce jungles of south east Asia. Hundred Percent Pure is an excellent and ambitious song that pulls off many different aspects of the movie and remained stuck in my head long after the credits rolled.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

A movie of a score 85 to me,"This movie does not let me down at all. It's exciting, gripping and inspiring with positive messages about gangsters, corruption, marriage, etc, like many other gangster movies.Denzel Washington's role is more convincing as he should be as the calm, low-profile and strong-willed man. Russell Crowe's role is even a bit more realistic, as a man full of weaknesses and flaws. But personally I find his appeal (as in Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind) seriously fading, partly because of his hairstyle and partly the limited role he's playing this time.The movie itself is convincing as it's based on a true movie. The plot is well developed and there are very few gaps to fill in. Something that displeases me is the excessive romances of the two characters, although I admit that they help to make up a complete plot.The thing I like about the movie is that it does not involve too much blood and gun shooting. It is the ideas and characters which strike the audience and let them think, not the weapons or the blood.Having said that, without the personal charm of Denzel and Russel, I seriously doubt if the movie would be as successful as it is. I mean, critically speaking, the movie's success still lies much in the good characters rather than the plot.I am from Hong Kong and I find the movie's style very much like many local gangster movies, like Inferno Affairs and products of Johnny To, especially the ending scence withe background music of Amazing Grace.Overall, I see no reason why this is not an excellent movie, and why Denzel should not be nominated, or at least dubbed, as the Best Actor of the year.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"A powerful story,  and not  swagger and violence, make this a great film","Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) moved to Harlem at an early age, where he worked for a crime boss. As the mobster's right hand man, he got a taste for power and for coming out on top. When the aging boss dies, the power shifts to Frank and he vows to be the ""master of the universe"" in his corner of New York City. Being extremely intelligent and ruthless to those who oppose him, Frank does what it takes to make his dream come true. He transports his brothers and other relatives from North Carolina to Harlem, for he can count on their loyalty to execute the workings of his master plan. Then, he travels to Asia himself and strikes deals with the Oriental exporters of heroin, guaranteeing a potent, superior drug and no ""middlemen"" to siphon off the profits. With the purest form of heroin and the lowest prices available, Frank's gang pulls in astronomical profits of the streets of Harlem. Frank lives like a king, with a most beautiful, pageant-winning Puerto Rican bride. But, there is one man poised to take him down. That would be Richie (Russell Crowe), a super-honest cop of the New York City police department. Richie once turned in a million dollars he found on the street, without taking a penny. When the drug laws enforcement agency of the United States comes calling, they nab Richie to head a cadre of officers dedicated to tracking down the kingpins in the drug traffic in NYC and putting them behind bars. With two hurricane-force men about to face off in a colossal test of will and power, who will be left standing? This is a great film, replete with very fine performances and a sensational tale. The acting crew of Washington, Crowe, Josh Brolin, Ruby Dee, and all of the others are made-to-order perfect in their designated roles. But, it is the story itself and the recreation of Harlem in the seventies that is even more impressive. Here is a world where the rules of middle town America do not apply and everyone must step to a different tune, one dictated by those who have the control. Ridley Scott, the director, as he did in Blade Runner, makes this lost world come to life brilliantly. There is some violence, yes, but just enough to show the reality of the situation and nothing in excess. Therefore, if you are thinking of another Scarface, you will be disappointed. As for the look of the film, it's costumes, sets, and cinematography, they are all beyond reproach. In short, this is a memorable film that tantalizes the viewer from beginning to end.

The kind of film that Hollywood built its name upon,"'American Gangster' - Ridley Scott, 2007True diversity is a rare buckle in the utility belt of your average mainstream director, yet English-born Ridley Scott has positively paraded this attribute over the years. To make a cult-shaped name for yourself through the genre of sci-fi ('Alien', 'Blade Runner') is difficult enough, but to build on this with drama ('Thelma & Louise') and thriller ('Hannibal', 'Matchstick Men') films requires some grand diversification. Therefore we shouldn't be surprised that his crowning moment came through another genre still - with sprawling Roman epic 'Gladiator' taking best picture and best actor gongs at the Oscars. Well, it's Oscar time again and Mr. Scott is back trying his hand at another foreign genre - the well tested drug/crime flick. 'American Gangster' is based on the true tale of heroin kingpin Frank Lucas - who used the Vietnam War to smuggle great quantities into Manhatten. Lucas is played by Denzel Washington who after tasting success as a villain in 'Training Day' seems intent on repeating the feat. Though as a much more pensive and world-weary criminal. Opposing him is common-man detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), salt of New York's drug-polluted earth and perhaps the most honest of the City's crooked police line-up.'American Gangster' is a story of two sides - black and white. Not in the literal sense of the words, but instead the black and white of the morality scale. We are told the tale of two powerful characters that face off across a slowly crumbling City backdrop, mostly unaware of one another's presence. Messieurs Washington and Crowe are two of cinema's more traditional actors (of those who remain) and fit their respective roles perfectly. Each reversing their general image to take up positions that both contrast and complement well. We are introduced to them as hero and villain respectively, but as the film rumbles on this outlook inverts back and forth, showing us both the good and bad qualities of each individual - so in the end we are not exactly sure for whom we should root. The showcase of 'American Gangster' is of course this aforementioned stand off between two different but also similar essences of man - yet there is some decent support work to make up our ensemble cast. With Chiwetel Ejiofor impressing once again as Frank Lucas' impressionable young brother Huey, taking to the drawling North Carolina accent with ease. Though for all this impressive talent, the cast does lack a little personality - with perhaps too much time spent on developing the personality of Manhatten itself, instead of its inhabitants.The bustling streets of seventies' Harlem are shot with a tender justice by Scott, who saturates everything of colour in order to show a City draining of goodness before our very eyes. We have been lucky this year to experience two wonderful reinvigorations of well-trodden genres, with David Fincher's 'Zodiac' joining 'American Gangster' as one of the finest modern portrayals of its respective type. Indeed many comparisons and differences can be drawn between the two. One of the negative aspects of 'Zodiac' was its bloated runtime, and at a lengthy 157 minutes 'American Gangster' could be expected to drag also. But this potential pitfall is skillfully avoided by the director - who's use of a striding score and decidedly restless cinematography ensures that while the film may slow down in places, it never stops outright. The only thing that perhaps proves to be a drawback here is the fact Scott isn't attempting anything drastically new with regard to plot - and although the interesting moral interchange between his two leads is unique enough, the sometimes clumsy dialogue lets the film down in places. An element that can be forgiven however when considering how much focus is placed on action and reaction, body language, expression and emotion.'American Gangster' is the kind of film that Hollywood built its name upon, yet somewhere along the line forgot how to reproduce. And one that represents another impressively diverse rung on Ridley Scott's film ladder.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Solid entertainment,"Ridley Scott's American Gangster is not only a hard-hitting exposé of a Harlem crime lord who outwitted the Mafia and gained control of the drug trade, but a revelation of the unholy alliance that existed between drug traffickers, corrupt police officers, and big business elites in New York during the late 1960s. Denzel Washington is Frank Lucas, a heroin dealer and organized crime boss who made millions selling drugs on the streets of New York. Successful in minimizing the power of Italian distributors who controlled Harlem by eliminating the middleman and buying heroin directly from a Southeast Asian source, Lucas' operation was, in the words of Sterling Johnson, a narcotics prosecutor in New York, ""one of the most outrageous international dope-smuggling gangs ever."" Frank began his career as the associate of Ellsworth ""Bumpy"" Johnson (Clarence Williams III), one of the leading figures in organized crime in the early 20th century and an enforcer who protected the Harlem interests of the Italian Mafia. As the film opens, Bumpy and Lucas enter a discount appliance store where Bumpy tells Frank of his dismay at the disappearance in America of ""pride of ownership"", ""personal service"", and the loss of the middle man in the sales process. After Bumpy's sudden death, Lucas attempts to build his own operation and undercut the Mafia's monopoly on the drug business by going directly to the source.Traveling to Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, Lucas concludes an exclusive arrangement to obtain 100 percent pure heroin which he sells on the streets as ""Blue Magic"", only 10 percent pure. Lucas operates under the radar, smuggling the dope into the States on military planes and bringing family members such as Huey Lucas (Chiwetel Ejiofor) from North Carolina to set up storefront businesses scattered throughout the New York/New Jersey area that serve as distribution centers. A determined enforcer, he is also seen as a suave businessman making arrangements with Mafia bosses and confronting his rival Nicky Barnes (Cuba Gooding, Jr.,) about infringement of his trademark use of the name Blue Magic.In a superb performance as the opportunistic crime lord, Washington projects a low-profile surface veneer of sophistication that covers up an explosive brutality. He refuses to dress ostentatiously, goes to church every Sunday with his mother (Ruby Dee) and is generous to his Puerto Rican wife Eva (Lymari Nadal) but will turn on a family member instantly if his security is jeopardized in any way. Lucas has no problem dealing with New York's anti-drug Special Investigations Unit, paying off the majority of its members, in particular Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin). What he doesn't count on, however, is an honest cop like detective Richie Roberts played by the outstanding Russell Crowe. Roberts, whose personal life borders on chaos, has become an outcast in his own department after turning in a million dollars in cash that he found in the trunk of a car because it was ""the right thing to do"".The relationship between Roberts and Lucas is the highlight of the film and their face to face ""negotiation"" near the end of the film is reminiscent of the meeting between De Niro and Pacino in Michael Mann's Heat. American Gangster is solid entertainment that is primarily a character study of two men on opposite sides who are determined to put their lives together, one to the benefit of society, the other to its detriment.The strongest aspect of the film, however, is its courage in exposing the web of corruption that existed in the police force at the time. In one scene, Roberts tells his fellow officers about how hard it is for him to gain cooperation from federal agencies. ""I don't think they want this to stop"", he says. ""Judges, lawyers, cops, politicians, they stop bringing dope into this country, about a hundred thousand people are gonna be out of a job."" In a trenchant commentary on the values in society, by 1977, 52 out of 70 officers who worked in the Special Investigations Unit were either in jail or under indictment.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Superfly gets a posh makeover,"Scott's flashy, energetic gangster biopic loosely follows the story of a real black drug importer and dealer of late Sixties, early Sevenities Harlem. Frank Lucas (played by Denzel Washington with his usual rush of energy and charisma) did indeed learn the ropes of organized crime from his black boss Bumpy Johnson, did import drugs from Southeast Asia using military connections, did bring his North Carolina family up to be his network for heroin distribution, and was brought down by cops and made deals with Ritchie Roberts (played with his usual conviction and strength by Russell Crowe). Moreover Roberts and Lucas did work together to bring down various dealers and crooked cops--and get Lucas off with only 15 (or maybe fewer) years in jail, not served consecutively.One can't help being of two minds about this film. In many ways it's just another gangster movie, and scenes in it will awaken memories of many others of the genre. It's hard to consider the black Superfly hero exactly a new creation either, Lucas reportedly he was not really the wealthiest or most successful black drug dealer, though he's made to seem so here. (The real Lucas reportedly was a definite presence in the shooting of the film and in the views of others is responsible for a number of distortions of the facts.) But the director of Blade Runner and Thelma and Louise, Gladiator and Black Hawk Down is not your average crap film director. He is a crap film director who can produce the occasional cult classic, and who awakens disturbed admiration even at times when his effort is somehow revolting. This film has great momentum and confidence, and its first half is a pleasure to watch. As seen here, and in the tall, regal embodiment of Denzel Washington, Frank Lucas is more than a top-dog gangster. He's a black hero and a bold economic pioneer, because he explicitly steps forth from the mold set by his mentor, Bumpy (Clarence Williams III in the film) to bypass the Italians and sell pure heroin, his own trademarked brand, at a lower price than the adulterated stuff on the street-- bypassing the usual wholesalers and setting up his own distribution system. And yet, while establishing a purely black business, he followed Italisn traditions in making that business his own kind of cosa nostra--once again a family concern, with his own mother (a glossily distinguished old lady) brought up to preside over a huge white plantation-style manse, taken over, refurbished in an elegant Afro style, and manned by discreet southern black crooks.So what we have here is a very hollow victory for Black liberationists. A black man who achieved the distinction of feeding heroin to Harlem's addicts all by himself, without white supervision or control. Hooray. While the movie avoids a great deal of gratuitous brutality (and the mass killing spree is carried out at the end by the cops, wiping out Luicas' main heroin packaging station), he is clear a very cruel man, capable of bashing in or blowing off a head at a moment's notice.Whatever distortion there may be, the glorification of the hero being the most morally dubious one, there are some convincing factual elements. Generally speaking an early-Seventies feel is nicely achieved through the use of down-tinted color and many, but not overstated, period outfits and hairdos. It's also an interesting point brought out in Scott's occasionally documentary-style passages that in the early Seventies American soldiers were returning Stateside in droves addicted to opium or heroin; that their various R&R points (notably Bangkok) obviously were well supplied with these drugs and accustomed to purveying them to Americans; and that (in the film anyway) Lucas went in country himself to find and cut a deal with a local kingpin, using a military cousin as the future intermediary. This is bold and original, but the boldest and most original stroke of all was to bypass organized crime. An independent businessman? The essence of American entrepreneur-ism? Hooray again.There appears to be exaggeration and blurring of facts in the depiction of Russell Crowe's character, New Jersey crime fighter Ritchie Roberts, as a noble yet flawed opponent. Here Lucas may not have influenced the final cut, since he reportedly says Ritchie was a man who could not have arrested his own mother. It's really at the end that Ritchie stepped in to cut deals as a prosecutor, and the cops who worked to bring Lucas down are underplayed or demonetize.Again as in New Jack City and some other films we're treated to repeated shots of a Harlem heroin packing plant staffed by naked nubile black women. Maybe they're essential to the story? How much is mythology here? Relatives of the real Ritchie say he wasn't a deadbeat dad as reported, because he wasn't a dad at all, and also not a philanderer. There is so much departure from the facts here, and yet the ending with its ritual string of on screen text-message follow-ups is mechanical and anti-climactic. Accomplished as it is, Scott's compellingly grand new black gangster movie is finally just another link in a conventional chain.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Okay, with THAT said, Russell Crowe, Denzel Washington, Ruby Lee, and Armand Assante lead this true 1970's story of police corruption and the escalation of drugs in New York. Think ""Serpico"" mixed with ""The French Connection"" mixed with ""Superfly"". Seriously. I was a little disappointed in Washington, who, more than anything, simply did his ""Denzel"" routine in a different outfit. He smeared too much of his patented ""proud black man deserving respect"" routine over what was, let's face it, a sleazy drug dealer and serial killer. (See ""Glory"" or ""Malcolm X"" if that's what you want, see ""Training Day"" if you want to see him stretch beyond his habits.) He was poorly cast in ""American Gangster"", and did not have the push to reach beyond what he can do in his sleep. As I think about it, Crowe - and just about everyone - was cast and then given a pass to do what they've done before and before and seemed satisfied with that. The story, even with it having a basis of fact to it, was not unique within the genre. Yes, it was good suspense drama, with strong dosages of violence, nudity, drug use, etc., and for some, on some evening, this will be enough. One viewing is enough for me. Even Ridley Scott, who directed it, seemed on vacation. The set and costume designers seemed to have worked the hardest of anyone.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
If you liked Departed you'll enjoy Gangster,"The point is: American Gangster isn't revolutionary film - if you expected never-seen before gangster story. But there is main reasons why you'll never notice it: everything is superbly done.Ridley Scott did amazing job: everything is on its place and fits perfectly - his way of directing carries script without any problem and you'll never have feeling you're bored although film runs over 150 min. Scott did great work with putting together main story and characters personal lives in a way that makes you interested in both. There aren't additional explanations of something viewer already knows - problem many films of this kind have and you'll notice many interesting lines in script that lead to questions director left for audience to think about - very nice. Fact that there are few action scenes shows what kind of director Scott is because film hold its dynamic tag line till last minutes, something to silence those who thought Scott isn't able to successfully direct anything except action.Russel Crow and especially Denzel Washington gave great performances. Washington would probably earn Oscar nomination if his role wasn't so close to his Training Day bad guy role. Fact he used ""My Man"" line from same film didn't help a lot, although it fits very good.So, here we are with (over)valued Oscars. Gangster earned 2 nominations and could earn much more without anybody asking any questions. Departed did earn more so Academy could redeem itself to Scorsese for not appreciating his earlier work. They should watch out - they could be redeeming to Scott one day.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A real American classic.,"Directed and produced by Ridley Scott and written by Steven Zaillian, the film is based on the criminal career of Frank Lucas, a gangster from La Grange, North Carolina who smuggled heroin into the United States on American service planes returning from the Vietnam War, before being detained by a task force led by detective Richie Roberts. Denzel Washington was brilliant as Frank Lucas and not to forget Russell Crowe in the role of Richie Roberts. The movie was nominated for a couple of Oscars, Ruby Dee for the Actress in the best performance in a supporting role and Arthur Max and Beth A. Rubino for the best achievement in Art Direction. The movie is tough and at the same time entertaining as well. The Director has shuffled the classic scenes and designed the gangster theme in a justified way. It is somewhat scary but thrillingly real American classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Like trying to squeeze five (5) pounds of beautiful fresh tomatoes into a tiny ten (10) ounce can,"A lengthier (2 hrs & 37 min) than normal crime based film that tried to encapsulate more than could easily be described on the large screen. The cinematography and music score were excellent and the actors were also top notch. But this film was like trying to squeeze two pounds of fresh tomatoes into a ten (10) ounce can, it got messy with a lot of true life crime and good story line laying on the cutting room floor.Superior actors such as Denzel Washington who played the real life shrewd and nasty drug lord Frank Lucas who maintained a cocaine drug stronghold during the late 1960's and early 1970's and the (then) honest detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) who eventually arrested Lucas and took away all of his wealth through the court of law were played masterfully.I was merely disappointed in how the producers attempted to package so much criminal historical value into a mere 157 minutes of screen time. The story line would have been much better served if produced as a ten (10) part TV mini series. I give this film version of the life and times of real life drug lord Frank Lucas a decent enough IMDB rating of 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Not at all gangster and (PERSONALLY) better than the Godfather,"From the poster and introduction of 'American Gangster', I expected violence and crime. Of course, I got a taste of all those, but ironically, it is the one that shows traditional poetic justice: good triumphing over the evil.Moviegoers got tired of black-and-white categorization of good and evil. In reaction to repetitive use of compulsively clear distinction, movies dealing with grey moral area or looking at good and evil from different perspectives have gained popularity over this 10 years. I am a fan of that kind of movie myself, but it's just so refreshing and satisfying to see traditional value uphold. Also, it is not that much simple this-or-that because Ridley Scott changes the dynamics among characters along the way. There's no definite friend or foe, and so as good or evil. A protagonist and an antagonist coming together at the end is, for example, a great shift in dynamics, but Scott makes it so smooth.Thrill and tension peak at Richie's one-on-one interview with Frank. It's just a conversation, but charisma and heaviness filling that room and that particular sequence are monumental, thanks to genius of Crowe and Washington.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Make It A BlockBuster Night!,I just finished watching American Gangster which comes out next Tuesday on video. I wasn't disappointed with the movie. It was as good as I thought it would be. Made to look in the 1970's in New York the costumes were great. I thought it was hilarious. The Black cop guy on Russel Crowe's drug force had visibly in one shot his upper arm showing. On his upper arm he has a Wu-Tang tattoo which is a continuity error. They should have costumed him differently as to look more professional but hey that's the least of their concerns on this production. The acting was good. I now think Denzel Washington is a more experienced actor but I still like Russel Crowe better. I didn't like Russel Crowe's fake New York accent. New Yorkers speak fast like Toronto people. The story line was good and portrayed things realistically. I love the mob influence and drug smuggling. Denzel's character got a slap on the wrist for what he did. That's amazing to be released after only 15 years. He lived out his term healthily and was released. Interesting ending with Denzel walking out onto the now 90's surroundings outside the prison.,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Ridley Scott's Own Take on A Proved Genre,"One of the things I love most about Ridley Scott is his willingness to try everything, he's tried his hand at almost every genre in his career and while it's hasn't always workout for him I always admire the effort. But I don't just have to admire the effort here because I loved this movie, it's one of Ridley Scott's best and one of the greatest movies of 2007. A large part of that is due to its two central characters. I loved the character of Frank Lucas in this film he was so captivating I loved seeing his arc and business acumen and is by far one of Denzel Washingtons best and most complex performances. Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott are great together I loved Crowes character because again he was a complex one I loved seeing him want more than what he had and I loved the scenes between these two characters. The world of Harlem in this movie just sucks you right in you immediately see what kind of place this is and see what's been done to it by people like Lucas. Another thing I loved about this movie was the fact that everything had consequences, we see with our own eyes the fallout of Lucas' dealings and make him a more well rounded character. I think this movie has some of the best uses of violence in a movie because it's used to enhance the story, the extra blood or close ups of drug ridden dead bodies sucks us into the atmosphere more. I also really liked Josh Brolin in this movie I thought his character added something to this movie his story arc of being a corrupt police officer paralleled very nicely with Crowes head strong, good-cop arc and added to the bleak atmosphere Scott was trying to create. other characters I loved seeing were Lucas' brother it set up a nice dynamic between them, it's was good to see them get sucked into this world and I thought it added to Washingtons character to see him slowly isolate everyone he loves and creates for some really disturbing sequences. If I have one flaw with this movie it would be that it's definitely similar in terms of style and tone to other Gangster flicks but if it works for what To filmmakers are trying to accomplish and it does just that then I'm fine with that for the most part but the only area I thought this didn't quite work for was the love story I just didn't think it added anything to this film and I didn't really buy the chemistry between the two.This is a fast paced, entertaining and long lasting crime thriller, it's one of Scott's best movies with great performances, very good character dynamics and arcs. It's definitely similar to other movies of this genre but it doesn't hold this movie back from its greatness.91%/A",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A Good Movie-- Just Not the Masterpiece I'd Hoped it Would Be,"The pacing in the movie was the one thing that I had a problem with. I think that even though the movie was 2 1/2 hours long, the plot seemed like it was developing way too rapidly. There was a lot of nonsense in the movie that could've been cut out and a lot of plot lines that could have been developed better. Denzel's character came to power way too fast and his relationship with his mentor was developed for a grand total of 45 seconds.Also, the talent of the actors in the movie wasn't used as well it it could've been. Denzel Washington didn't really have as much good dialogue as I was hoping for, although Russel Crowe was really good in this movie.Another thing worth noting on. Has anyone else thought of it as funny as I do that Cuba Gooding Jr. has gone from legendary, academy award winning actor to not even being an ancillary character in a movie like this. Oh how the mighty have fallen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Ridley Scott Knocks One Out of the Park,"Director Ridley Scott has surprised me: he's finally made a movie I liked. Since the last one was ""Alien"" back in 1979, I'd pretty much given up on him.""American Gangster"" is a kinetic, dazzlingly entertaining crime film. It features two strong performances from Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, but this wasn't a movie that left me remembering the performances. Rather, it's the great writing and assured directing that left me most impressed.Washington plays Frank Lucas, a drug dealer in 1960s Harlem who applies the principal of the American dream and capitalism to his drug trade: make something better and sell it for less, and pretty soon your product will be the one to beat. Crowe plays perhaps the only honest cop in New York City, who's appointed the leader of a narcotics unit whose mission is to bring an end (or at least curb) New York's rampant drug market. All of this is based on a true story, but who knows how accurate it all is. And frankly, with a movie as entertaining as this, who cares? The film only slows down toward the end, when Washington and Crowe finally meet, and the screenplay decides it must tidy things up in a ""here's-the-moral-of-the-story"" kind of way. The rest is energetic and highly accomplished. The film doesn't join the ranks of ""The Godfather"" as one of the best American films about organized crime, but I'm not sure it tries to, and that's one of its best qualities.A host of other actors appear in supporting roles, including Cuba Gooding, Jr., Chiwetel Ejiofor, Ruby Dee (memorable as Washington's mother), Ted Levine (who I'll never be able to see as anyone other than Buffalo Bill from ""The Silence of the Lambs""), Josh Brolin (who has now officially appeared in every movie released this year) and, chewing the scenery, Armand Assante doing his best Marlon Brando impersonation.Like him or not, there's no denying that Scott does know his way around a movie set, and with ""American Gangster"" he's given us one of the best and one of the most entertaining films of the year.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Promises a lot, delivers very little","Oscar season is here and the first real major film that wants to challenge for this years Best Film award is here.Oh boy has the marketing machine worked its magic here. This film wants to be taken seriously, as seriously as The Godfather or Goodfellas, from everything from the slick trailers to the simple yet stylish movie posters and even intro credits.The main selling point of this film are the lead actors Denzel Washington and Rusell Crowe.I'll drop my first humdinger by saying I don;t think these actors are anything special nor are they even in the top few actors around at the current time.Rusell Crowe has only ever impressed me in one film. The best film he has been in was LA Confidential, but that wasn't really down to him. In that film he played something of an oaf with little emotion. In Romper Stomer he played something of a thug. And in his award winning performance in Gladiator he played something, yes you guessed it, an oaf and a thug. I should add in here that Gladiator is in my opinion an utterly awful and overrated film with little substance. If American Gangster was to go on and win the Oscar for Best Film like Gladiator did then it would only cost the Academy Awards the little bit of credibility they have left IMO.It is not all bad though because Crowe did put in a performance to be remembered in the film 'The Insider' which I thought was actually VERY good and easily the best performance I have seen form him (Beautiful Mind included).Next we have Denzel Washington. An actor who IMO was nothing special. He then won an Oscar for Tarining Day and was propelled to mega-actor status. Since then he hasn't really put in a truly brilliant performance. The thing I don't like about Washington is arrogance, he exudes it, I am not sure if its on purpose or not but I think he can certainly add it - just look at his character in Training Day - arrogant to the extreme and this kind of carries on into other films, Inside Man for example. He is also a bit annoying in this film, whenever me says 'My Man' and smiles I just want to slap his face.However, both of these guys have been in fairly decent films recently, especially Crow in 3.10 to Yuma. So I was of course open to them putting in great performances to make this a great film.I am not going to go over every point of the film but I Will quickly go over its major flaws Accents - come on Crowe - you are meant to be one of the best. Crowes accent was all over the place in this movie. There is a thread running on IMDb currently running at 6+ pages debating this point but I am 100% sure his accent wasn't consistent throughout.Gangster - this isn't a gangster film in the truest sense. Its nothing like Goodfellas/Scarface/The Departed/Usual Suspects etc. So you Will Be disappointed they used this title and made it look like something that it definitely is not (marketing eh?) instead expect something slower, much much slower...If you want to see loads of guns and killings and underground activity then this isn't the film for you.The length and pacing of this film is all wrong. It is too slow and too long. The vast majority of scenes jump from one place to another too quickly. Most of the scenes are too short and there are probably only 2 or 3 really decent scenes. For my money none of these scenes really build up to some sort of peak like they do in the great movies.So what about Washington and Crowe? Well it is fair to say Crowe was much better in 3.10 to Yuma and in this film he is only really something of a bit part character as he is probably only getting 30% of screen time compared to Washingstons 70%. They were both OK but nothing special.Good points? Well there are not many. Of course the sets and costumes were definitely decent. The music was good but I was disappointed with the plot.Having read some of the comments at IMDb the 2 most appropriate words would be 'uninspiring' and 'dull' - its an OK film but it's definitely not as good as they are trying to make it look.Overall the film is above average. 7/10 - best of the year? Not at all. 3.10 to Yuma is much better overall and deserves any award before American Gangster.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Why glorify a drug-lord?,"This film has all the ingredients for a spectacular project; Interesting story,big actors,good budget but it just doesn't utilise these ingredients effectively. The story is epic, a progressive look at a man's rise and fall in the drug world, with settings from the slums of Harlem to the jungles of Vietnam. There are moments of excitement but very few, and the whole theme is too formulaic, echoing films like 'Blow' and the 'Godfather'. Drawing on the synopsis, you could make an accurate prediction of all the main events in the film. The 'Frank Lucas' character seems to mirror Pacino's 'Corleone', as the 'family man','the silent introvert thinker' and 'the calm gangster prone to the occasional act of extreme violence'. In addition, although Washington pulls a great performance, he fails to portray Lucas. Lucas was a violent drug-lord who killed thousands with his product, and still boasts his deeds to this day(youtube.com). Washington portrays an ethical figure with strong family values trying to live the 'american dream' while corrupt cops and gangsters try to stop him. In reality, he should be classified in the same category as the other scum in the film, since his actions were just as, if not more, unsavoury. In my opinion, 'Frank Lucas' is not portrayed in this film, Denzel plays himself and it's difficult to hate a sincere, well spoken, handsome gentleman. Denzel doesn't even put on the strong southern accent which Lucas has. If this film was not based on a real character, then I would rate it as a mediocre gangster movie elevated by grand performances from the front men. But since Washington is supposed to portray an arrogant, vulgar drug-lord, my valuation is lower. In the future, it would be no surprise if films depicting Hitler as the misunderstood leader, or Charles Manson as a fallen icon, are released.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Boring; Predictable into the details,"Where do all those good ratings come from? This is not an interesting movie.
The characters are poorly developed. Their storiy lines are predictable from the very beginning, why would I go on watching? Especially since visually there's nothing new here either. It's too bad, a waste of talent. There's technical skills in this piece of work, and a lot of money. But no ideas. After watching, I don't know what this movie was made for.
All the major actors do a solid job, the dialogue is well written, and the production design is great. But to what point? There's nothing happening to keep me interested, mostly because the characters seem to come from the book ""Cops and Gangsters in the movies: This is how it's always been done"".
Also: Has Ridley Scott met more that five women in his life?

"""The Godfather"" meets ""Coonskin"" and ""Catch Me If You Can""","It's one fine solid movie with interesting characters and an interesting story. I was really curious how Ridley Scott would handle such a Bio-History-film. Of cause ""1492: Conquest of Paradise"" for example, was a good work but I had always some problems with the pacing.To be true, it was the same problem with this movie. Especially at the beginning. Some shots and cuts seemed so hard and unplaced... nearly like he was trying to make a Sci-Fi-Horror.So the build up of the two main characters was a bit rough. And it took some time to get deeper into their story and meaning.But when you get over this and you are still interested in the story, you will get a pretty good movie with many nice twists.From time to time you will get some sweet Déjà-Vu's thinking of ""The Godfather"" and ""Catch Me If You Can"".Also you can feel Washingtons and Crowes development as their characters grow with the story. Crowes spiritedly comic-relief character is the perfect counterpoint to Washingtons mostly serious Version of the black godfather of Harlem. It's a joy to watch them when their stories overlap.A big plus are also the well detailed sets and a rousing soundtrack. You get a good idea of the tone of that time.If you like to know more about these days, I recommend to watch ""Coonskin"".

"Excellent, for OK","Generic though meaty and detailed period crime piece makes good on it's Hollywood slam-dunk with two charismatic leads, outstanding set design, and director Ridley Scott's hip guidance to boot. It is nice to see all the effort that went into production, as emphasis here clearly falls on the atmosphere with a quite impersonal script guiding the procession.Yes, the film is a tad overlong, crammed with minutia, and awkward in spots, but in the end a lengthy procrastination leading up to the satisfying though under-utilized meeting between Crowe and Washington gets built up to almost epic proportions; like Heat, only a tad cooler, and way more derivative of crime drug cinema of the past.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Could have been better,"I think that American Gangster would have been a lot better without the cops or maybe just without Russell Crowe. Maybe more of Lucas in Thailand or more with the family.

Maybe more of his rivalry with Cuba Gooding Jr. There is so much good stuff underdone because it keeps having to go Russell Crowe's characters marriage problems and custody fight.

Was that Clarence Williams III?,"He is not credited anywhere but he is in the pivotal first scenes of the movie & is he referenced several times as the King of Harlem who mentored Denzel's character. The actor is no where mentioned in the credits. Is his character based on a real person like Denzel's? Denzel by the way is great & certainly deserving of a third Oscar for his mantle. Russell Crowe is also good but as in his last two movies ""Yuma"" & ""Good Year"" he seems to have given up acting almost entirely and appears to be playing some facet of himself. Everyone knows he's a great actor but he doesn't seem to be picking roles that really challenge him. Take Armand Assante for example - in this movie he takes a role (Mafia kingpin) and gives it a new twist. Knowing he can never compete with Brando's take he still manages to put a new spin on a tired old part. Cuba Gooding is wasted in his part but in the few scenes he does have he lets off a few sparks. And what about Ruby Dee? Should she be nominated just because of the body of her work? American Gangster is sure to get plenty of Academy nomination.

A cross between The Godfather and The Departed...,"A cross between The Godfather and The Departed, American Gangster is set in the East Coast in the '70s and based on the true story of how Detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) brought down the low-profile heroin kingpin from Harlem Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington). While both men lay on opposite sides of the law and are notoriously flawed, they uncannily share a rigorous work ethic, enabling them to later conspire against something bigger than themselves.The opening scene immediately establishes Lucas as a cool and collected gentleman from North Carolina who can get scary when angry. Meanwhile, Roberts is a scruffy but honest cop who is battling with his hostile wife for child custody while he goes to law school.Both Oscar winners turn in award-worthy performances once more, but it is Crowe who most consistently and easily transforms into his character. He is an imperfect hero who buys dishonesty with honesty. His dedication despite his shortcomings makes the viewer relate to and root for him, even when Lucas tempts him: ""Would you do it again, return US$1M in unmarked bills?"" American Gangster gives hope that police corruption and widespread drug trafficking can be stopped even by the sometimes morally deficient. The message comes across clear with director Ridley Scott's compelling visuals, with crisp contrasts in montages reminiscent of The Godfather. Such deft cinematography could sometimes eclipse the dialogue, which contributes its fair share of memorable quotes.A parallelism with the Italian mafia's affinity for family is evident when Lucas tells his siblings, ""The most important thing in business is honesty, integrity, hard work... family... never forgetting where we came from,"" and again when Lucas scolds his brother Huey for wearing an attention-getting suit, ""The loudest one in the room is the weakest one in the room!"" Lucas' drive to deliver his product at all costs threatens his downfall, when he refuses to heed his Thai drug supplier's strangely wise advice: ""It's not in my best interest to say this Frank, but quitting while you're ahead, is not the same as quitting."" This biopic doesn't bombard the audience with gore it could easily get away with but instead it allows for thought-provoking moments, such as one launched by Lucas: will putting the bad guy behind bars really change anything? Roberts' gritty retort: ""You represent progress, that's why they hate you. Success has enemies; be unsuccessful and have friends.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

This time Washington and Crowe set the screen (and the box office) alight,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThe true story of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), former driver for Harlem kingpin 'Bumpy' Johnson, who after the old man's death uses the things he learned from him over the years to start up his own heroin empire along with his friends and family. He eventually comes to control 1970s NYC with absolute power, until Det. Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) gets on his case. One honest cop in a department full of corrupt officers who are themselves embroiled in the drugs game, from selling it themselves to using it themselves.Twelve years ago, when Denzel was already a big star but Crowe was just a starting out Kiwi actor, they appeared together in Virtuosity, a sci-fi action film that tanked at the US box office and became one of the most high profile straight to video films ever in the UK. But all this while later, the acclaimed Ridley Scott has reunited them for this explosive real life gangster film with much more successful results. And, though they share virtually no screen time together, between them they keep the boat floating marvellously here.The star of the show, though, is Denzel. My favourite black actor, he reliably sets the screen alight here. He's delivered some of his best work when he does intense, power-house kind of roles, but as Lucas, he turns in a much more restrained performance, a cool, calm, calculating psychopath who shocks you by punching a man and then slamming the top of a piano into his head but somehow manages to be just as un-nerving knocking a cup of coffee across a room after describing how police officers tortured and killed his brother when he was younger. In the supporting role as the good guy, it has to be said, Crowe is less effective, not turning in a bad performance, just nothing to write home about, especially compared to Denzel. Still, the film does a great job of juxtaposing two men, on opposite sides of the law but also on different sides of morality, Denzel's character a man with a dishonest and evil trade but who never forgets his roots and looks after his family, Crowe's a good cop but an absent father and shameless skirt chaser.Scott has done a great job of bringing NYC to life as it (apparently) was in the early 70s, a grimy, unappealing sh!thole, a million miles away from the trendy, Central Perky look it has today. He allows his story to develop, and moves it along nicely with a neat list of supporting actors, as well as a cool, funky 70s soundtrack through-out.Everything pays off quite marvellously here. It's taken a while to arrive, but as the film year draws to a close, one of the best chugs along just in time. *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Not enough mano-a-mano,"The gangster story, like the Western, is a quintessentially American genre. And, in many ways, it is the opposite of the Western. The Western is about the taming of the frontier and the making of a nation. It values individual initiative through hard work and playing by the rules, along with material wealth and the spirit that comes from community. The gangster story bemoans the corruption of the American Dream. It shows individual initiative through illegal means, a corrupt, paranoid community and a success that is defined only through wealth.The gangster genre is really a form of crime story, and when you write one you need to be very aware of this larger context and deeper theme. It is all about how an individual succeeds in American society. Knowing this allows you to tell a larger tale. And it prevents the audience from distancing themselves from your story by saying, ""Oh, that's just a bunch of foreigners killing each other in some pocket on American soil."" Writer Steve Zaillian knows this larger context, which is why he can justifiably call this story of a black drug lord American Gangster. True to the form, he uses the story structure of the rise and fall of a king. Frank Lucas is the American businessman gone bad, and the fact that he is black is relevant only in that he represents the latest ethnic group in America to take this dark path to success.But Zaillian isn't content to simply twist the gangster form by using a black main character. He tries to expand the scope of his story by using the larger crime genre. This is a broad category of stories - with gangster as one of the sub-genres - that focuses on the battle between cop and criminal. Ironically, Zaillian's choice only serves to diminish the scope and power of the film.Crime stories derive much of their pleasure from two main elements: the plot machinations between the cop and the criminal and the blending of moralities by which the cop and the criminal live their lives. The first element is almost non-existent in this story. Frank's rise to power is unique only in his use of US Army personnel to bring his heroin from Southeast Asia. Cop Richie Roberts uses techniques that have been standard on TV crime shows for years.This weakness in plot puts a serious dent in the dramatic power of the film, because it also means there is not enough mano-a-mano. There's none of the pleasure of Heat or The French Connection here. Frank and Richie, played by two powerhouse actors, have essentially one confrontation in the entire film. It's a good one, but it only highlights how much direct confrontation is missing in the rest of the movie.The writer's choice of having two central but separate characters takes an even greater toll on the other key element of the crime story, the moral blend. We normally think of cop and criminal at two opposite extremes of the moral spectrum. A good crime story will use the battle between these two characters to show that the moral difference between them is much more ambiguous.Zaillian shows the moral contradictions within each of these characters individually. One of the reasons the classic gangster story is fascinating is that the gangster holds two wildly different moralities within his own head. On the one hand, Frank believes in family, integrity, and professionalism. He also believes in selling dope and killing people who get in his way. The gangster's ability to compartmentalize these impossibly different ways of living is one of the great examples of the human mind's almost infinite ability to rationalize.Cop Richie is pretty good at compartmentalizing his morality as well. He turns in a million dollars of corrupt money and goes after dirty cops, but he's also a bad husband and father. An ongoing dramatic confrontation between these two men could have produced a deeper look at what is truly moral and immoral in American society. But it never happens.Instead, the most interesting aspects of these characters and their real moral contrast come at the end of the film, in written epilogue. Richie, the incorruptible cop who brings down kingpin Frank and three fourths of the cops in the narcotics division, switches from prosecutor to defense attorney, and his first client is Frank. He succeeds in getting Frank only fifteen years in prison. But we've already seen that Frank has not only destroyed hundreds of lives through his drug running, he is a cold-blooded killer.When I read that my eyes popped out of my head. And I wondered, Where's that movie? This script just started getting interesting on the last page.FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
engrossing true - life story,"Certainly an original story, although it's probably told in an unoriginal way. The scheme is the one of a family drama, cat and mouse style, and the entertainment is really heart pumping. Wouldn't say the movie is clichéd, on the contrary it's got its originality and charm, focusing perfectly on Ney York city's mean streets. The director provided some unique shots (Vietnam connections, corrupt military personnel and so on). As for the lead actors Russel Crowe is in my opinion much more inspired but the pair works on the whole and never disappoints. This film has attracted a significant audience not only for being boosted by such stars but because it digs deeply in the story with style and pace.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great Gangster Film!,"American Gangster is one of the few gangster movies I have seen. I think it might be one of the best if not the best. Another thing that makes this movie great is that there is historical accuracy, not a 100 percent but still accurate enough. This film is about a detective named Ritchie trying to capture the drug warlord Frank Lucas who is involved in many operations. He did this to support his family. An outcome involving the capture of Lucas really amazes me. Nearly three quarters of New York cops were arrested and convicted of bribery charges. Ridley Scottt did a great job directing this film. He can do any genre without making a fool out of himself. The acting is pretty good. I think Denzel Washington is a great actor. Russell Crowe actually did something right for once. The technical parts of the movie is pretty good. The movie is somewhat boring but I was kept awake because I was intrigued about the plot. I rate this movie 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
There is no such thing as honest cop with so much money around,"I think there is no such thing as honest cop with so much money around specially in those years. The performance overall is very good and the story is very well placed. Who would not share his fortune with his family? Lucas(Denzel Washington) is sure one of the best family man role I have ever seen however despite the fact of being nice we must not forget that criminals of any kind are not the way of a civilized human as maybe the movie tried to show us(for instance Lucas got out of jail in 15 years that is so so little time for crimes he had done). If you think more real than you can see that if criminals like Lucas get only 15 years for what they had done than probably 10% of people on the earth will try to do the same thing(make money for his child, family) so there would be no fear for the future of their seed,genes, fortune because they can still hide that money and put it to use in future. There is a nice moral lesson in this movie which I kinda liked since it made me dream of perfect world where there would be no corruption and fortune for everyone - that's why I would say I liked the role of Russel Crowe as being one of the very rare that are not dirty cops. I rated this movie 9/10 since I kinda noticed director being on mafia side.

Overdone,"This film looks at the rise of a black gangster in NYC in the early 1970s. The plot has similarities to ""The Godfather,"" but this film is a far cry from that classic. Although he sports a glum look to convey toughness and ruthlessness, Washington is miscast as the drug lord, a truly despicable character that is at odds with the actor's persona. Crowe fares better as an honest cop. Scott is certainly a competent director but the film could have used a good editor. While the plot is rather simplistic (was it really this easy for Frank Lucas to become a drug lord?), it is drawn out to epic length with repetitive scenes that add little to the narrative.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Another great crime movie,"As a fan of the crime genre, this was an obvious choice and I can say I have no regrets. I enjoyed it. I was a bit lost at the beginning because I felt like everything started kind of fast, but I gradually got into it and especially from the second half of the movie I enjoyed it and got really into it. The fact that this is a film based on a true story helped a lot. I am satisfied. We had a view from both the police and the gangster's side. That didn't hurt. As always, I was more interested in the gangster's perspective, but I wasn't downright bored by the police perspective, so it didn't matter. For me, a great movie that I recommend to fans of gangster movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

American Hokum',"I went into this film with high expectations, tinged with a touch of trepidation due to Russel Crowe's name attached to the project, but I figured, Denzel Washington in a fur coat playing a baddie will get me through.How wrong was I. From the first frame this film stinks, it stinks because everything about it is phoney. Ridley Scot would be ashamed of himself, he has no understanding of the time, the place, the story and least of all the characters. He's not even slightly redeemed by some revelatory cinematic trickery that he learned whilst making commercials all those years ago.Russel Crowe is an embarrassment, he has to be one of the worst actors at work today.

Very good... and a little long,"You'll hear people describe American Gangster as a Black Scarface or a Black Godfather. Well, it's much better than Scarface, less compelling than The Godfather and certainly not a ""black"" film. It's a two-and-a-half-hour crime drama about the inherently capitalist nature of American crime that manages to feel epic despite it's small-scale story. In fact, it probably could have retained that same feel with an efficient 15-minute cut or, conversely, a serial adaptation to HBO. The character of Frank Lucas could easily sustain his own television series. After about two hours into American Gangster, I couldn't help but wish I could change the channel and pick up his adventures next week. The movie is that good... and it's that long.Denzel is intense. Crowe is in top form. Scott has crafted an entertaining and meaningful film. But the greatest achievement is Zallian's screenplay which packs in so much story and believable character development with a pitch-perfect ending. Or maybe the greatest achievement is the editing, which builds such a compelling tale out of so many, tiny, efficient scenes that you have to wonder how many more hours of this film are sitting on the cutting room floor.Maybe they should throw those extra hours back in and sell American Gangster as a miniseries.

The Best Movie of 2007,"On November 2, 2007, a movie was released by the name of American GANGSTER. This movie just so happened to be the best movie of the year.I can say this with a little less than 2 months left in the year of '07 with confidence because I know that this movie will be almost impossible to beat. This movie is so good that it knows it's good. (Now that is GOOD)The story of American GANGSTER is loosely based on a true event involving two men. One by the name of Frank Lucas and the other, Richie Roberts. Mr. Denzel Washington plays the role of Frank Lucas, a heroin lord who ingeniously and quickly rises to power on brain power and audacity. Mr. Russel Crowe plays the role of Richie Roberts, a New Jersey detective who thrives on not being 'the dirty cop'. He grabs on to the Lucas case. These two actors are heavyweights. They are gods. Watching them go head to head is any movielover's dream. It is amazing to see so many superb actors in such a great picture. Ridley Scott stunningly directs a huge, long, complex movie into a highly energized, entertaining, and instant classic gangster flick. Watching this shows the viewer the vast differences in all of the various Mafia families- different race, different way of life. One thing stays the same and remains true for all families. You are only a true gangster if you can pull off the 'gangster'. This movie does just that. Total recommendation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

This is in my opinion the best movie since casino and goodfellas but its not a wiseguy movie.

What the heck was Denzel & Scott thinking...,"This movie was horrible, I wrote an online blog about it and sent it to over 300 of my friends and colleagues I don't know what Ridley Scott was thinking nor Denzel Washington for that matter. There were too many insignificant stories going on...the plot was weak, there was an extreme over saturation of actor/entertainers that no one cared about (ie: Common, and TI and the horrible actress that played Denzel's wife- my God her performance made Mariah Carey's in the movie Glitter seem Oscar worthy).There were also too many camera panning debacles, hair, makeup and wardrobe was horrible- the scenery at times didn't match the period in time in which the story was being told (hence the 1 train coming out of the subway -then a panning over to 8th avenue and 135th street)Come on guys- New Yorkers, notice everything about our city-just like I noticed that they shot the Williamsburg Bridge in a scene that was supposed to represent New Jersey. What the hell was that? This was a horrible waste of film and casting and an insult to intellectual movie viewers with half a braincell. Can someone tell me what's really going on in Hollywood -no wonder Tyler Perry opened at #1 with his over saturated - cinematic mess - I expected more from Scott and Mr. Washingon- tell me is everyone in movie-land on ""blue magic?""

... but not Scarface,"I was really tempted to write ""African American Gangster"" in the summary line, but since that's what most will read, sometimes even without looking at the actual comment of the movie, I was afraid it would stir too much discussion. But here in the text I can write it, because I can point out that it's a joke on the title of the movie and of course on all the PC thing going on right now (in our society). Just my kind of weird humor.But back to the movie, that could be called the ""Heat"" of Russel and Denzel. Yes the two have played in a movie together before and who can't remember the classic Sci-Fi B-movie they were in? No seriously, does anybody remember the name of that movie? ;o) I have seen that first collaboration (minus Ridley of course), but it must have been at least ten years ago. It was nice as I recall/remember for the sort of movie it was. The funny thing is, that they might have had more on-screen time together back then, then they have now!Still now with Ridley directing them both and Russell C. leaving the staring (or ""better"") role to Denzel, this movie is already considered a classic by many. Russell wanted the Denzel role here, but since Denzel gave him the better part in the Sci-Fi B-movie I was talking about earlier, Russell thought he owed Denzel (that's how it was written in Film magazines). But Russell's role got bigger (he fought for that of course), making his character more believable. And here are other similarities to HEAT. Russells cop is similar to Pacino's character. Caring only about his job and not so much about his family/wife. Of course he has some ticks/nuances that are different from Pacino's role, as has Denzel's character too, who's more of a family man (so to speak). But Denzel's character seems to have some similarities with the Nic Cage character from ""Lord of War"". Only a few things that seem to be identical, but then again this also could be just a coincidence.Anyway the point is, that Ridley made another great picture, having assembled a cast and crew that were/are on top of their game. Highly recommendable! :o)",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great merging of plot directions makes this film an awesome watch,"American Gangster is a movie that must be watched closely in order to be fully appreciated. The character of Richie Roberts is portrayed wonderfully by Crowe and the background behind this character is paved well. Unfortunately the background of the character of Frank Lucas (Washington) was not fully shown to the audience from my perspective. I guess this is the case due to time constraints, but it seems his character launches straight from bodyguard status to drug-lord status without any real progress of development. Despite the background discrepancy with Frank Lucas, Washington portrays the character wonderfully and their is no doubt the acting in this film is top notch, but its expected with this cast.This movie is able to take the basic plot of drug-lord vs police force, cut it up and add extra plot directions and munch it all together so it ends up being more like drug families vs corrupt police force vs honest police force. And the greatest thing of all, it does it successfully.You really need to see this movie, its amazing how it is compiled and executed on the screen.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Denzel - My Man....,"From the reviewers posted by certain people I had got the impression that American Gangster one of the top films to have come out of Hollywood , having said that only very few actors with big names like Crowe and Washington can carry off something as great as this without the egos clashing. For me American Gangster was truly worth all the hype , Ridley Scott set out to tell us a story , not only entertain us and he carried so well that it was so easy to get sucked into it. Denzel Washington played a rather different type of gangster , unlike a drug kingpin like Tony Montana or Nino Brown , George Lucas comes across as a charming caring, figure who at the end of the day was probably conducting business unaware of the ramifications of what he would end up turning Harlem into however Denzel Washington plays this character with such grace that one actually anticipates his presences on screen with his knowledge and Savoy. Russell Crowe as well plays a very flawed character with great ease and really sticks to his guns and during the course of this movie one can say that both men are fighting for what they believe in . Aside from Washington and Crowe everyone else played the part well , it was as if everyone really did enjoy their screen time which actually made it probably more realistic and not to mention the colours,lights, and camera angels used by Scott make this a true beauty to watch. My only problem was that it was over 2 hours long and I did get a neck ache afterwards but however in the whole there was never a scene that dragged on. My conclusion is that American Gangster is homage to the blaxipoltain flicks of the 70's as well as telling us a story which has not been stereotyped into a certain genre. Certainly this movie must be on your '100 movies to watch before I die' list.American GANGSTER : 8.9 OUT OF 10THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE American DREAM...",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Unoriginal but still gripping,"Ridley Scott's 'American Gangster' does exactly what it says on the tin: it's the tale of the rise and inevitable fall of a New York crime lord. Based on a true story, it's original part is the fact that its villain was a suave African American who out-manoeuvred the mafia; the film is also the story of the rare honest cop who brought him to justice. There are some very familiar elements here: in spite of the different racial background, one could argue that 'Goodfellas' is one inspiration for this move, while the use of 'Across 110th Street' on the soundtrack is depressingly predictable (even though I like the song!). I also found the start of this movie a little confusing and uninvolving. But Scott is an experienced hand when it comes to mainstream but classy entertainment, and while the film's later part offers relatively few surprises, its unarguably gripping, and makes you want to know more about the real life of its protagonist.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Meandering to the point of detriment,"O Mobster stories don't do a lot for me, but I am willing to persevere in order to find quality. American Gangster doesn't really fit that bill: there are some elements to enjoy and a pretty sizeable cast with a budget to match, but below this I didn't see a lot to love. Denzel gives a strong showing (when does he not) and Crowe's effort is admirable, but they are let down by both the script and the rest of the ensemble. There is violence for those waiting for thrills, but the plot drags to the point of boredom. Further to this, the intricacy of the plot is going to be lost on most people - dragging dialogue does nothing to translate this story from page to screen. By the end, you're waiting for a conclusion above all else; to me, this is not the hallmark of a quality movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Entertainment Yes! Based Very Loosey On a True Story Also!,"I really enjoyed the movie by all means. All the characters brought something to the table. Before watching the movie, I did my research on the huge Harlem heroin epidemic in the late 60's and early 70's. I learned about the key players involved in the movie which really made it a lot more enjoyable. Its really funny how all the ""King Pins"" were suppose to be these ""Hardcore Gangsters"" who ran Harlem, but in really it was just clicks of 5 or 10 people who were friends in the drug business. Yes, they had respect, but they lost it as quickly as they got it. And in the end, all of them ""Ratted,Turned,Flipped"" what ever you want to call it. They all sold each other out like cowards to save their behinds. So, you can call them American.... But way to far from Real Gansters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
American Gangster,"""See, ya are what ya are in this world. That's either one of two things: Either you're somebody, or you ain't nobody.""This is the philosophy Frank Lucas lives his life by. When it comes to gangster films this sentiment is certainly true as the difference between a cult classic and a forgotten film is exactly the same as the difference between black and white. There isn't really a middle ground for those films that come in between, if they don't compare to such illustrious predecessors they are forgotten. Based on the true story of Frank Lucas' rise to notoriety and fall from grace, American Gangster is a tale of power of corruption set in Ridley Scott's graphic recreation of 1970s Harlem against the backdrop of the Vietnam War. Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) was the driver and bodyguard to 'Bumpy' Johnson, an Italian styled black gangster who ran most of Harlem. Following his boss' death, Lucas emerged from the warring factions to become the heroin kingpin of New York. Importing 100% pure heroin from the suppliers in Asia, to cut out the middle man, allowed him to sell better quality at a lower price. However, his reserved manner and economical lifestyle allowed him to swoop under the radar of the law. Business boomed for the Lucas Empire as the blaxploitation era of the 1970s raged. Enemies began to appear from all walks of life, but he was untouchable  or so he thought.On the other side of the law was Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), a detective battling his way through a law degree at night school whilst battling for custody of his son. Richie is an idealistic and honest cop who earns the distrust of his corrupt colleagues which leads to him becoming an outcast. The reputation he gains for being 'an honest cop' leads to him being put in charge of a newly formed drugs task-force. His ostracization from the force allows him to see Lucas' rise to fame and fortune from the streets. From here the game of cat and mouse that cop and criminal become engaged in begins.The paradox of the ethical and family valued 'bad guy' and the womanising, renegade 'good guy' leads to a blurring of audience's loyalties. The two share a rigorous dedication to their ethical codes that means they are set apart from their colleagues allowing for the growth of a mutual respect towards each other. Washington is particularly good as the calm and assured crime lord, only occasionally displaying the ruthless streak that underlined his authority. Crowe plays the dogged detective struggling to maintain his honest approach when his private life is crumbling. The fact that the two central characters only finally meet 20 minutes from the end is the result of an atmospheric tension that builds throughout the film with the stories of both men gradually being drawn together, in a way that is reminiscent of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in Heat. Whereas some gangster films rely on shoot outs and special effects to raise pulse rates, American Gangster, like its protagonist, is much more reserved in showing how Lucas dominated the landscape without much bloodshed. The few scenes that do display his violent streak are powerful in their sparsity. However, the problem is it just seems to drag on for a little too long with not enough happening to keep the viewer gripped to their seats. The running time of 2 hours and 37 minutes could easily have been cut down to around the 2 hour mark and there would not be much of a difference in the story. It is well dialogued, brilliantly acted and powerfully shot but the thing with American Gangster is that it just doesn't quite have enough to make it a 'somebody' but it's too good to be dismissed as a 'nobody'.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Generic Cops and Robbers,"This is a generic, throwaway cops-and-robbers movie whose only memorable feature is the charismatic presence of Denzel Wasington as a Harlem drug lord. It takes the overly familiar formula of juxtaposing the life of a super criminal against the elaborate investigation of a dedicated and untouchable law enforcement officer (in this case, a forgettable Russell Crowe), essentially giving you two movies in one until the investigation and the crook go head to head.The problem is, neither movie is all that interesting, taking formulaic routes that we've seen a million times before. The only real result of giving equal prominence to the cop and the robber is that you wind up with an interminable running time.Both Washington and Crowe give performances that are reminiscent of roles that you've seen them in before (Washington in ""Training Day"" and Crowe in ""LA Confidential"") and if you have a hankering to see those actors, either of those earlier films would be a better use of your time (although the far-fetched ""Training Day"" is only superior by a nose to ""American Gangster,"" and then only because of Washington's riveting performance).

Standard gangster film made good by performances and occasionally brilliant directing,"A biopic about a drug dealer starring Washington, Crowe, and Scott. Thank God for the Oscars. It is wonderful seeing two actors with such brilliance (both have appeared in several films already this year; guess dominating the Oscar races makes for steady employment in Hollywood) and a good director to guide them through their material.The movie suffers a little from having two such big movie stars in one film. This is mostly Frank Lucas's story, and I didn't really get to know him as much as I would have liked. Russel Crowe plays a police officer who seems to have a crummy family life just to give him a fatal flaw. Russel Crowe is the right man to play him, injecting a good deal of street sense intelligence into him and making him gruff enough to counter his role as the purer-than-driven-snow cop.Without giving too much away, I will say that the most effective scene in the movie is when the two meet for the first time. This scene left me shaking with emotion, not because the scene hasn't been played out in thousands of gangster/caper movies, or because of the soundtrack which has played in thousands more. Seeing these two characters for the first time is so well shot that there is a potency and mystery in simply these two men just staring at each other.The movie is not without flaws though. One key part of the story is the corrupt nature of the NYPD Special Narcotics Unit. However, the point-man for this part of the story seems strangely insulated from the rest of the story. He does a lot of generally sleazy things and makes a few hazy threats at Denzel and Crowe, but doesn't inject himself in enough to make the payoff entirely satisfying. Also, while the courtroom scenes involving the Crowe character's divorce are brief, my suspicion is they would have been more interesting on the cutting room floor, especially if they had made room for more scenes involving Lucas's rough edges. My guess is even the most stylish gangster in Harlem wouldn't be as smooth as Mr. Washington.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
An American Tale: Washington goes East,"Director Ridley Scott brings to the screen, American Gangster, the true story of Frank Lucas, the notorious drug smuggler during the 60s and 70s revolutionized the drug industry. Oscar winner Steven Zaillian writes the crime piece but doesn't provide the viewer with enough fuel to launch the film off the ground. The countdown to take off was great and then the viewer stayed stagnant with the engines going for nearly forty-five minutes before the rocket took off. All the dialogue seemed too forced and too aggressive to engage us into the film. It was like a five year old telling us to ""Watch this, watch this."" Alright Mr. Scott and Mr. Zaillian, I'll watch just stop telling me to do so. I think there was too much anticipation built up into a mediocre storyline.Academy Award winner Denzel Washington stars as Lucas bringing forth a candy cane version of his ""Alonzo"" in Training Day. As the ferocious Frank, Washington manages to inherit all the fury and anger of a troubled young individual yearning for success and leave his inhibitions at the door. As a terrific turn for the veteran actor Washington does an admiral job on a character we hardly know and introduces him to us full force. How can Washington manage to be so good and make all this seem effortless? Beats me, but the fact that it looks so easy and the character doesn't demand too much of Washington may be his undoing in this upcoming awards season. While a nomination isn't out of the question, with two wins to his credit, this performance holds no measure to his previous works. Zaillian was unsure how malicious he wanted to portray Lucas and ended up portraying him as incredibly unsure of himself and how he wanted to be. But maybe that's the character and Scott just failed to let us know.Russell Crowe plays Detective Richie Roberts, a narcotics cop battling more than the drug war on the streets of New York. The monotone detective never lets Crowe break out of his exterior tough demeanor. A big star like Crowe definitely takes on this supporting turn with a sense of humility and that perhaps is the triumph of the performance. With big starring turns in Gladiator, Cinderella Man, and A Beautiful Mind, I would never expect Crowe to take on such a quiet role and do it with dignity. An impressive turn but doesn't have the pivotal scene that one actor yearns for that steals any scene.With 90% of the film having Washington and Crowe separated, the anxious and satisfying meeting in the finale settled all tension built up throughout the film's narrative. Ridley Scott seems on the back burner of this picture as he allows his stars to run the show. The supporting cast even shows some brightness off and on.It's Ruby Dee as Mama Lucas that capitalizes on her limited screen time. As a veteran actress she does have the power and potential to break into the extremely weak Supporting Actress race. She shows vulnerability yet an intense courage that evokes the audience when she's on screen.Josh Brolin's exciting and villainous turn as a crooked cop turns out to be a strong turn for the actor who is having one hell of a year with an acclaimed turn in No Country for Old Men. Chiwitel Ejifor has a presence in a film that is soothing but doesn't flow with the characters he chooses. He might be Hollywood's best kept secret at the moment with the wrong roles.In the end, American Gangster may not have enough steam to jump into the Best Picture race. With Scott being so ""overdue"" for a Oscar, that may the film's only hope. With comparisons be thrown around to The Departed, (which doesn't measure by a mile) last year's winner, the film already has an uphill climb ahead. Serious potential for Washington and Dee for this year's Oscar race. The film is enjoyable but tries too hard to start off with a bang and ends up leaving the viewer disenchanted and we spend too much of the premise trying to play catch up.Grade: ***/****",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"""American Gangster""; fitting name","Crime-drama/gangster movies generally fare well (The Godfather, Goodfellas, The Departed, etc.). American Gangster continues that streak. It follows the rise and fall of a black family crime empire, headed by Frank Lucas (played by Denzel Washington). Lucas is successful because he imports drugs directly from Vietnam, resulting in a stronger dose for lower price. The real hurdle is met when a detective, Richie Roberts (played by Russell Crowe) pursues a lead to bring down the empire. The plot starts off slow, following the distinct daily lives of Lucas and Roberts. After the first hour or so of setting things up, everything comes together to form a compelling story. The last hour is extremely high quality across the board.The direction from Ridley Scott is as expected: clean and elegant. The acting from Washington and Crowe is also as expected: powerful and believable. These two factors are the key to what makes American Gangster so good. It reminded me in several ways of The Departed: the first hour sets up and develops the characters, while the rest is a beautiful clue hunt and battle of smarts. The whole thing is unpredictable but flows in a logical way. One thing that I especially liked was the Vietnam War reflections. Throughout the film, there are snippets of television news programs that reveal the breakdown of the war. It effectively parallels the growth and decay of Lucas's drug empire. The drug production sets were realistic and effective. While most of the movie revolves around the drama aspects of crime, there were some fantastic action sequences.In the end, I was left with plenty of material to think about. There are interesting points about the drug empire and moral questions that arise from the conclusion. The main message is not hidden; it is expressed explicitly in a dialog between the two characters toward the end. Ultimately, I was left satisfied. One of the best movies of the year, so don't miss it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Riveting Powerful and Exciting,"I was very impressed with the acting all across the board. I thought Russell was great...maybe its the role, maybe its Denzel always being Denzel, but I thought Russell had the harder, less flashy but more nuanced role and he was great. But all the many supporting players rose to the occasion. I was surprised to see some actors I hadn't realized would be in the film like Joe Morton and Ted Levine. I think the big revelation is Josh Brolin...this should make his career if he doesn't blow it picking bad projects down the road. Many of the scenes will haunt you... and there is a line (don't worry, I won't give it away) that really cracked-up me and my 3 friends who all work in law firms, we just burst out laughing. I think you'll know it when you hear it.One indication of how people felt.... even at its long running time there was hardly any movement...i.e. people getting up to hit the restrooms... people seemed riveted.This film brought back the wonderful days of movie-making from the 30's - 50's when yes there were stars but supporting players also got a lot of attention and good material. There is a lot of texture, wonderful cinematography and food for the mind. I will be seeing it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Denzell owned this film,"I've read a lot about Frank Lucas, the Harlem drug lord of the 80's depicted in this story, and even though I liked this film for pure entertainment, it did vary so much from the truth about Lucas that it was closer to fiction. It did do the broad strokes about his life pretty well, but purposely added or subtracted many connecting details for greater audience entertainment value. Director Ridley Scott usually puts a lot more suspense, fear and terror into his films so I was surprised that there was so much less than his usual in this story of the kill or be killed jungle of street drug dealers in Harlem. There is almost no life on earth tougher and more life threatening every second of the day than that of a drug lord, and it was in reality much more threatening to his life and that of his family than was shown.Denzell Washington as Lucas, even though he is as coolly intense as an actor can be, did not let much ""street"" break through his high and mighty, cool cat demeanor, even when the story might have been better with more of it for greater crime realism. However, his prominent role was by far the best one in the film and more convincing than Russell Crowe as Richie Roberts, an(the only?)honest cop soon to become a defense lawyer, who dogged Lucas to jail after he finally found out that Lucas was at the top of the drug dealer food chain, a perch that was heavily supported by the men in blue, most of whom were on the take. Crowe was satisfactory overall in his bad husband/good cop role, but it was Washington who really owned this film. He is such a powerful presence as an actor, and when he was watching or listening to someone you could almost feel the wind from the wheels turning in his head. That alone conveyed well the stone cold calculation necessary for survival at the top in his jungle.A very entertaining film all in all, and I was glad to see that the storyline didn't kill Lucas off in a a fit of typical Hollywood, crime-does-not-pay, phony comeuppance, but he was shown briefly as he walked out of prison in his $50 suit, looking sadly out of place and a nobody in the modern outside world after so many lost years in prison. What could be more pitiful and humiliating than that one thing for anyone who used to have real power? Does any crime ever pay if you have to spend even one night in the very cruel and unloving embrace of the graybar hotel? Not to me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"In depth crime drama that stays well bottled up in it's own period of violence, power, and corruption.","""American Gangster"" is clearly a film that stands as one of those classic time pieces of power and shows it's culture very strong. Directed by Ridley Scott who shows so much power and greed in this drama as it showcases the rise of power of real-life 1970's Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas(Denzel Washington) and the struggles of a conflicted cop Richie Roberts(Russell Crowe). The contrast is typical good guy against bad yet the viewer sees both as conflicted as Roberts a divorced cop with his own problems of women and commitment while Lucas is seen enjoying success as a family man from illegal means as he makes his fortune thru smuggling heroin from Southeast Asia. Really a good cop like film that captured the time and culture of the 70's well by showing the rise of the street drug culture really the film brings back memories of ""The French Connection"". As typical with gangster films this is filled with greed, blood, and most of all corruption. The performances are strong from both titans Crowe and Washington as this was really a good culture film that stays bottled up so well in it's 70's time frame yet it ends in my opinion showing corruption showcased as a champion like theme which has became so common in our money hungry culture.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Ridley Scott delivers yet again,"The American Mafia was largely controlled by a string of brutal Sicilian families. Rival mob organizations targeted one another in bloody confrontations. Harlem was no exception. New York's largest black ghetto  a happy hunting ground for drug pushers  was to face its toughest challenge yet.When a much-loved icon and drug dealer passes away, the reins of his empire are picked up by his impressionable protégé  Frank Lucas (Washington). But Frank has bigger designs for himself. A self-styled entrepreneur, suave and sophisticated, Frank wants to cut out the middlemen and be his own man.During America's most-stained period in history  the Vietnam War  Frank seizes the opportunity to acquire huge quantities of A-grade heroin. On the other side is the vulnerable hero Richie Roberts (Russel Crowe) who is determined to bring him down.The story twists and turns for almost three hours towards its conclusion.

Great Movie!!!,"My 24 yr. old daughter & I saw it today, and we both give it a 10. The chemistry between Denzel & Russell when they finally meet was very real & believable. I was only in Jr. High back then, but old enough to know what was going on. It was a history lesson for my daughter, she said it must have been a drag for people back then to go to pay phones all the time (no cells) and she was surprised at the number of soldiers addicted to heroin while fighting on behalf of the USA, in Vietnam. In summary it was a valid depiction of a true story & how lives were changed for good or bad. I will see it again with my husband.

Bad directing,"I don't believe any of you actually watched this movie. This movie was a complete flop. I have not seen a movie so poorly directed in along time. Ridley Scott was ether asleep or on drugs during the making of this movie. The goofs comment failed to mention that in almost ever seen the microphone is hang in the picture and sometimes the whole boom is sticking half way across the screen. I don't care how good the acting is when you've got a microphone almost hitting them in the head the movie is ruined.

Drug Kingpin movie done right,I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. It is a little over 2 1/2 hours long and I didn't even notice. I would compare this movie to Scarface with a Harlem setting. A typical drug lord story of the rise and fall but it shows how powerful and secretive Frank Lucas was and where it all went downhill to him getting caught. That is not a spoiler as this is based on a true story. I also recommend watching the biography of Frank Lucas or reading up on the story of Lucas prior to watching the film. Denzel was great as usual and I definitely recommend this movie. Stick around and watch the subtitles at the end and listen to a great Pulbic Enemy song that puts it all in context.,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
By Far the Best Movie I Have Ever Seen,"No, I did not get what I expected. I will tell you one thing, if your going to see people get killed left and right don't go.

If i could ever say a man deserve $40 million for acting it would be Denzel in this movie. Do yourself a favor and go to the movies and see this one. It was the best 2 and a 1/2 hour movie I've seen, and is worth every penny and every second. Go see it, do not hesitate give them the money they deserve. Its easy for me 10/10, Hands Down the Best movie I've seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Gripping Drama,"A totally engrossing movie from beginning to end. Great performances from Washington and Crowe. I'm guessing it will get Best Picture and at least one, possibly two Oscars for the leading actors. I've never seen Washington in a dud movie. Crowe, however, is a different story. In both this movie and 3-10 to Yuma his American accent just doesn't cut it. He first came to light (to me) in Romper Stomper, which no doubt brings him to the attention of the likes of Ridley Scott when casting for similar movies. I'd have no hesitation recommending this movie to anyone. Even with a length of 2.5 hours the time seemed to whiz by. The accuracy with which the director created the late 60's can't pass without comment. Fantastic !!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
flawed but well-made and entertaining,"Riveting crime biopic of Frank Lucas--a former enforcer of the late and legendary Ellsworth ""Bumpy"" Johnson--who built a lucrative heroin smuggling empire, rose above the mob, and became the most dangerous man in Harlem in the late 1960s, but he doesn't reckon with Richie Roberts: a dedicated cop and boy scout determined to bring him down no matter what the cost. Ridley Scott's ambitious cops and robbers saga is overlong and not as compelling or informative as it could be, but well-cast and consistently interesting, with an impressive look at the past era that effectively captures the atmosphere of tension, violence, and brutality of Lucas' extravagant life. Washington, as expected, is a force to be reckoned with as the fiery Lucas, matched by Crowe as the steadfast Roberts, surrounded by an excellent supporting cast. ***",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Gotta love the irony,"I first heard about this movie when Fuqua was going to direct it so immediately I was hooked. I loved Fuqua and Denzel in Training Day so anything short of that would be a disappointment. The fact remains if your looking for a great movie you will not find in this movie. It's a 3 hour documentary that portrays Frank Lucas to be a modern day Robin Hood to Harlem. The movie has it's flaws as many does. The 2 hour and 40 minute flick does not need to be this long. The story of Richie Roberts and his child custody case does not need to be included but I guess it adds character to Richie Roberts and the type of man he is; a man dedicated to obeying to the laws and doing the the job correctly and obiding. Surprise Surprise Denzel once again gives an Oscar winning performance. Although I can say with a strong opinion if this movie does win Picture of the Year it is not better than The Departed. The Departed had more action and did with less time. You do have to realize that Fank Lucas is a complicated business man and telling his story under 2 hours just could not happen but I feel as though Ridley Scott got caugh up in the heat of the moment and wanted Denzel and Russel on screen more than that was necessary. So although I may not be a qualified source to give a true accurate rating for this movie, I have seen enough movies in my life and enough Denzel movies to give my insight. A solid 7.0 out of 10 I feel does this movie justice. It is worth seeing but do not expect to see a blood bath given out by Frank Lucas because sorry to disappoint you but it does not happen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Excellent, yet without depth","American Gangster is clearly a movie born from the lessons learned from movies such as Scarface, The Godfather, and other gangster flicks. Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe perform quite well at their roles. Washington plays Frank Lucas, a black entrepreneur who uses skills he learned from his earlier career to become powerful and wealthy in the dope trade. Crowe plays a detective who's scrupulous honesty on the job makes his life harder. The characters are quite enjoyable to watch as they make their way throughout the film. The key enjoyable aspect about this film is all the parts are B+. Nothing is fantastic yet nothing fails to disappoint. The movie is long, more then 2 hours and crawls at a slow pace you'd expect from a character study. Yet although the characters are fun to watch, they lack depth, as if the film is not really concerned with their personalities beyond what is required for the story. Ultimately this movie is entertaining and it is quality, however its ultimate lack of depth combined with its slow pace prevent it from becoming a hallmark of its genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Good Movie, Great acting.","My wife and I have been looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time. She loves Denzel and I like Russel Crowe in everything he has made. Also, Ridley Scott has been my favorite director since the death of Mr. Kubrick; Blade Runner, Gladiator, Master and Commander, are all examples of his brilliance. I mention all this because although I thought American Gangster was a good film, and Mr. Washington and Mr. Crowe were both excellent in their roles, I am a little disappointed with Ridley Scott's directing. The character development was good, the feel of the sixties and seventies was right on and the music was great, but the movie was just not the tour de force I was hoping for. I don't know exactly what it was, some other people have said; the length of the movie was too long, or the movie didn't flow as well as it should, and they may be right. But these are not things you come to expect from a Ridley Scott movie. If anything, most of his movies leave me feeling like there should have been more. Anyway, this was a good film and although it might have lagged a little in the middle, I still recommend this movie for the great performances of the actors.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A decent movie,"I've been looking forward to this movie for a long time. I love gangster films (mainly Scorsese's films) so I couldn't wait to see this. It was nice to see Russel Crowe as the good guy considering in 3:10 to Yuma he was the bad guy. Now the strangest role was the fact our hero Denzel Washington was playing the bad guy. The movie was long but it was a fun and enjoyable ride.Russel Crowe plays Richie Roberts who takes pride in what he does. He's not a dirty cop (you learn quick that pretty much everyone else is) and he does pretty much everything by the book (kind of like Simon Pegg's character in Hot Fuzz). In fact, very early in the movie, he finds almost 1,000,000$ in unmarked cash and still turns it in even though he almost new that the other cops would take it. His character was very well developed as we learn that constantly doing good wrecks his family life as he goes through a divorce at the same time in the movie.Denzel Washington plays Frank Lucas who deals heroin from South America (if my memory serves me right) and quickly becomes the biggest drug-lord in the city. He's a smooth talker and pretty much has no competition. In fact, he brings his whole entire extended family into the mix as they live in his big mansion.You already should know the plot so I won't do much explaining. It's a cat and mouse movie (even though the leads only have about 5 minutes together in the whole movie) and it is a fun one. I do have to tell you though, I felt the length of the movie was a good half an hour too long. There were plenty of unneeded scenes so the movie didn't flow as well as it should of. The character development was good but this movie could have been so much more. I did find that the ending was rewarding and you learn a lot of interesting facts about Lucas and Roberts that will probably make you gasp in amazement.It was well directed for the most part. Perhaps a few shots lingered too long but overall Ridley Scott did a good job. There are some bits of humor in the film. My favorite part was (thanks giving or Christmas day - can't remember) when a dirty cop finds heroin on Lucas and he promptly says in a caring voice, ""No need to start anything, why don't we go home and have pumpkin pie and warm apple cider."" (something like that). He then gets in his car and beats the hell out of his brother. I really like Washington in this role. Sure he's just like he is in most of his other movies but we routed for him just like how we routed for Al Pacino in Scarface. In fact, Peter Travers calls this movie the black Scarface. I do agree. Russel Crowe Was great like usual as we also routed for him. To me, the biggest enemies were the dirty cops.I wasn't at all blown away but it was worth the tickets and the wait in the long line. 6.5/10 is my verdict.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Denzel Washington is repellent,"There is something inherently wrong with this movie, something that does not make sense and is quite contradictory. One thing for sure, Denzel Washington's depiction of Frank Lucas is terribly disturbing. There is an obvious contrast between the personal history and character of Denzel Washington (as Lucas) and the violent, greedy, selfish actions he commits. One wonders constantly throughout the movie how Washington's (Lucas) conscience had led him to do what he does--the movie never tells us. What the movie does say is that Frank Lucas is the opposite of what he does: He is noble, literate, and--something so blatantly deceptive and dishonest--a fighter for the working man, for the middleman. I don't suppose that the movie wants Lucas, and his mentor, to be perceived as a noble figure--after all, he did commit murder, right?--but why is there no sense to his actions? Why is he a thoroughly chilling mystery-man? Why is someone who possesses such obvious criminal motives, depicted as a hazy and aloof personality? My only thought is that Denzel Washington believed that only a man of such mystery can control and dominate others the way Lucas has. But this is something that could not make sense in this context, after all he did shoot people (does anyone shoot people in public and walk through the streets as if he has just saved the world from its evil destroyer? This was what it seemed like when Washington has done it). It merely makes the movie contradict reality--a man like that would NOT walk through the streets feeling noble, and certainly nobody would think him as such. This alone make the movie repellent and unreal. It avoids the real circumstance of a criminal and no less a gangster like Lucas. (I don't think the movie deserves a 1 rating, but its present abnormal high-rating makes it a fair balance).",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
how about Black Gangster or product of the environment...,"this is one of the best based on a true story gangster dramas i have ever seen. this film goes right up there with Goodfellas. the only issue i have with the film is how sudden the end seems to occur. the way things began to quickly unravel was totally unexpected. having knowledge of the back story, or the actual story, makes this film even more interesting. the relationship between Frank Lucas and Ritchie Roberts is not portrayed in the film with great detail, but the subtleties of the beginning of the relationship are introduced. although Lucas is an unapologetic criminal, he is also a business and family man. Roberts is honest to a fault with serious family issues. the ironic parallels are presented in the film in very interesting visual sequences. this movie does not try to turn Lucas into a hero, but it is difficult not to admire what Lucas was able to achieve given his environment. there are many reasons to see this movie. if you like gangster movies, see this. if you like Denzel, see this. if you like movies that actually employ African-American talent, see this. finally, if you just want to see an interesting story of two highly motivated individuals with opposing goals, see this.not surprisingly, the real life relationships that were portrayed in this film are even more interesting than as portrayed in the film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

A welcome return to the traditional gangster formula.,"The first frames of American Gangster show Frank Lucas, Denzel Washington, setting a man on fire and then shooting him to death. You would think this would set the tone for an incredibly violent film. Instead, American Gangster decided to take it s...(read more)low, and build its tension at a slow boil over it's rather long 157 minute run time. American Gangster is a very good, very effective, and somewhat unsettling gangster film that will almost certainly have it's place at the 2008 Oscars. It is the first mainstream gangster film to return to original genre format set up in the 30s, the rise and fall of a gangster. American Gangster is two stories. First it is the story of Frank Lucas' rise to power as a heroin dealer in the 1970s. This is where the film spends most of it's time; exploring both the business side, and the personal side, the film spends a lot of it's time on Frank's family. The second story is of Richie Roberts, Russell Crowe, a narcotics detective attempting to take down a drug empire in a world of dirty cops. Both stories are equally captivating and if there is one fault of the movie it is that the two stories feel awkwardly separate at first, and that's because they are. I said earlier that the tension is set at a slow boil. Throughout the film there are seemingly random shots of drug use used to establish setting, and Ridley Scott cleverly sneaks in Vietnam coverage on the television that in many cases parallels the story. This simmering tension is incredibly effective, making the sociopathic tendencies of Frank Lucas really jump off the screen. The violence is often abrupt, gritty, and once the climax of the film is reached, we're given one of the better, most realistic shoot outs I've seen in a while. The acting in American Gangster is top notch, Denzel delivers his lines with an unsettling calm that really makes the character feel dangerous. Russell Crowe makes the cop feel endearing and yet human, and keeps you rooting for him. In the end, American Gangster is a really really good gangster film and on top of that, just a great movie in general. Does it rank up with the crime classics like the Godfather and Goodfellas, no, but it's damn close. Ridley Scott takes all the right elements and makes them fit into one incredibly entertaining film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Stereotype all the way,"The policeman is no angel in the purest of catholic senses, meaning he has extramarital sex. He is aggressive for an aggressive town. Otherwise he is a nice guy. The gangster is a variation of the old stock character tart with a heart of gold. Again, he is violent, but only because his job requires him to. Usually he too is peaceful. Drugs bring lots of money. And at the same time they are sometimes treated with less respect than wheat flour.

Excellent portrayal of the human condition,"Unlike other reviewers, this movie resonated w/me on more of human level and less on the gangster theme. It's as if Ridley Scott used the latter as an excuse to explore the duality that is inherent in all of us and the often subtle shades of gray between what is considered good and bad in our society.The story itself was beautifully portrayed by Denzel Washington as the family-oriented yet ruthless drug dealer and Russell Crowe as the straight but womanizing cop and neglectful parent. The story raises the question of what is 'good' vs 'bad'? Are they merely a social construct impeding our natural human tendencies, or perhaps, simply one and the same inherent in all living beings. Afterall, how do we reconcile the behavior among very human primates who lovingly care for their young but will not hesitate to brutally kill and eat the young of other primates? American Gangster is one of the few Hollywood gems that explore the deeper, often contradictory nature of human behaviour, and in my opinion, far surpasses other films in the same genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
American Gangster = American Hero,"Pros: Interesting story and strong performance by Denzel. Cons: Predictable. A few directing and acting flaws.In the tradition of Blow (2001), here is a real American Hero...America has been glorifying gangsters way before hip hop and gangster rap, way before television ""The Sopranos"" (1999), hit movies Scarface (1983) and Goodfellas (1990). Guns and seemingly limitless funds (read ""fun"") were an end and a mean (by a mean I refer to both the demeanor and misdemeanor, and I mean by any means necessary) before the Godfather (1972) et al. had every prototypical Italian American and his neighbour imitate Brando, Pacino, De Niro or Pesci ad nauseum and quote lines of gangster movies like people used to quote Shakespeare. The American Dream, before ""American Idol "" (2002) produced prefab Pop Stars, was of an entrepreneurial spirit realistically closer to the original spirits-bootlegging Scarface than say an arguably antisocial, enigmatic, Bill Gates. America's gun culture endures. Thus the title of the movie alone, alas, says a lot about the American subconscious.This may even go beyond the United States boundaries as Hollywood and U.S. influence on the world culture is still very powerful--in Japan, you have the Yakuzas From Bonnie and Clyde (1967) to American Gangster (2007), movies about money and violence has been very popular. For example, there is a clear preponderance of high ratings for such movies in the Internal Movie Database – IMDb, the most popular movie website in America and on the planet. At the time of this original article (Nov 2007), four out of the five overall best- rated movies in the TOP 250 out of hundreds of thousands are of that kind!In this rendition of the gangster movie genre which focuses on a clever, ruthless 'black man' in Harlem's 1960s who builds a drug empire, the glorifying is not overt, yet it is not really made in a way that you will realistically root for the ""good cop"" instead of the ""bad a*s villain"". The movie has depth in content in that it deals with connected racial tension and government involvement in corruption and drug trafficking. A big angle to the tale is that bypassing regular drug channel and getting the product straight from the source in Far-East Asia with the help of the US Army in Vietnam, this 'black man' or nig*r (America's subclass or worse than nothing) was able to overshadow even the Italian Mafia's chokehold on organized crime, which unsettled more than a few people from both sides of the law. Also, the systematic corruption in New York law-enforcement agencies that permitted the fight on drug trafficking to be very lax as well as these state employees actually profiting from this decadence in the streets, was brought to light and to life quite vividly.In this picture, Denzel dazzles and is a great villain in his portrayal of Frank Lucas, although not to the degree of his Oscar- worthy Training Day (2001) performance. He gets a chance to shine occasionally and more so towards the end, but the script and directing did not allow him to show his full arsenal on celluloid. Russell Crowe plays a cop again (L.A. Confidential, 1997) and is as subdued as his character. What I did not like is that the subplot of his personal life, although maybe interesting on paper and a worthy contrast to add complexity and not fall into black-and-white territory, did not really work and detracted instead of enhanced the picture. These were the only parts that really felt long and underused out of the otherwise well-paced 157 minutes. Carla Gugino did not really hit the mark as the wife, but it seemed to me that it was more of a storytelling mishap out of Ridley Scott's directing. He should have handled it differently to have a better impact or not use it at all and maybe spend more time on Frank Lucas' personal or ""professional"" life.Besides this little lack of character development that can be seen for pretty much most of the characters, the film is a good story, well told and well placed into the context of the time and place of the narrative. The conclusion wraps everything up nicely. Thank you, come again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
One of the best films of the year; although not groundbreaking for its genre.,"It's pretty interesting hearing the overall consensus on American Gangster. Either you love it or hate it. I don't know how it can be so clear cut but whatever. American Gangster is a very well executed film; the acting and directing is first-class. The hype around this film ultimately hurt it however, it was really billed as a 'modern day Godfather'. I doubt very highly that that was the aim of the movie makers here.American Gangster is nothing like that. Nothing new is done here as far as the crime genre is concerned, it's just so BRILLIANT in its execution.ActingIf there was any doubt as to Denzel's acting ability and prowess, there shouldn't be after his performance here. Hell, there shouldn't have been any doubt after Malcolm X, and that was 15 years ago! He and Morgan Freeman have a similar presence on screen; he is simply a master and commands respect and attention. There's nothing else for me to say about him, he carried the film. Russell Crowe was very good as well. His character's story is not liked very much, but I for one liked his story. From his character dealing with corruption to the issues with his wife; I liked seeing not only Frank Lucas come up in the drug world, but Richie Roberts (Crowe) come up in the 'cop world'. Crowe's character added a good balance to Denzel's powerful performance; and I felt the two sides of the story came together very nicely. As far as the supporting cast, Ruby Dee..not exactly a role that really pushed her to the limits, but she hit it on the head with great subtlety. Arguably the best supporting actor in the film, in my eyes, was RZA. He really showed that he's dedicated to making it in the movie industry in more ways than one (movie scoring & acting); and he REALLY came through here. It was ironic seeing him play a cop, but he did it very well.his 'junkie' scene near the end was classic. T.I. & Common were decent as well, but they really didn't have much to do; RZA had the biggest role out of all of them, and out-shined them all. I'm not a fan of Cuba Gooding Jr., and I must admit I was surprised seeing him here, but he was good as Nicky Barnes. His one (well, only) scene with Denzel was a sight to see; it's a great scene; right up there with Denzel & Crowe in the end. Armand Assante was a welcomed sight as the Don, I've always liked him as a character actor, and he does mob guys flawlessly. Josh Brolin was wonderful as the corrupt detective; he was as creepy as Matt Dillon in ""Crash"".DirectionYou can see Ridley Scott's influence throughout this movie. There's such a sense of control, pace and outright direction throughout. From the set pieces to the camera shots and how the story is presented, there's a very mature look and feel to the movie. This is one of the classier crime films, reminiscent of Michael Mann's touch in ""Heat"". There's still a grittiness to it, which again is telling of Scott's direction.StoryWith the public being bombarded with the 'real story' behind Frank Lucas on various documentaries on television in the days and weeks leading up to the film's release, this also hurt the film. There are reports that Lucas himself said that the film is 60% accurate, and if you saw the documentaries on Lucas before seeing this film, naturally you would be disappointed somewhat, because everything wouldn't add up. I am fortunate that I didn't see all of the extra features on television, no doubt done to further hype the movie which it REALLY didn't need. People have to remember that this is BASED on a true story. This is a movie, NOT a documentary. The more people realize that, the better.HypeThe hype machine for American Gangster was too much in my opinion; and ultimately took away from the film. I will admit that I came away with slight disappointment when the end credits started rolling. There was such a craze and hype surrounding the film that you couldn't help but expect a ""next Godfather/Goodfellas/Casino/Scarface"" type of filma cult classic of sorts that's so grand in stature that you had no doubt that it would indeed be an addition to that list of genre-defining, pioneering gangster films that we all love. It falls short of that, which is why feeling a little disappointment afterwards is almost inevitable. There is nothing new here; nothing innovative, nothing genre-defining (or RE-defining for that matter). No 'extremely realistic shootout scene' as featured in ""Heat"", or ""quotable-laden, cocaine filled shootouts"" as featured in ""Scarface"". No characters as memorable and legendary as featured in ""Godfather"", ""Scarface"" or ""Goodfellas"". Denzel's Frank Lucas comes damn close (because he's THAT good), but I don't think it quite reaches that status. There is nothing in American Gangster that REALLY stands out in that way.I would say, however, that as far as black gangster films go, it may very well be THE best ever made to date. With its sheer brilliance in its execution, acting, directing, storytelling, maturity and class; I could say with confidence that it is. And that, in and of itself, makes it one of the best movies of the year hands down (I see at least 3 Oscar noms here), if not one of the best of the new millennium.8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Are you kidding me!,"I don't want to give away anything about the film so I will give you my broad opinion. The anticipation I had for seeing this film was off the charts, and I tell you, that excitement ended about 5 minutes into the film. Ridley Scott delivers something that has the feel of a student film, the acting is mediocre except for Denzel, Josh Brolin and Russel did a decent job oh and Mama Lucas was also believable at times. The dialog is so so, the cinematography was nice, the cuts could have been better. I was never able to get absorbed in the film, it felt so fake and unattached.I compare this film to the New York Yankees. You have an all star cast and crew, but even with all the talent in the world if someone can't make them bond and become one unit you have a talented ugly mess. I don't see American Gangster getting nominated for any awards what so ever.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
An electric performance from Washington does not help the film's meandering storyline,"Much like Martin Scorsese before him, Ridley Scott continues to pump out films with his eyes set out on a little Gold statue for himself. Sure, his last real shot was with Gladiator, which won Best Picture and Best Actor, but failed to net him Best Director. Now, hot on the tails of Scorsese's own Oscar-winning masterpiece The Departed, Scott has climbed into the saddle and created his own crime film in American Gangster.Gangster, much like Departed, is a parallel story. On one end, it follows the story of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), a businessman who deals in the purest heroin New York had seen at the time, and in being black in the early 1970's, is not exactly making a lot of friends. On the other side is Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), a sex-infused detective hell bent on defeating corruption and just being an all around good cop.Right from the offset, the audience knows Lucas and Roberts are going to meet at some point in the film. Scott hypes this up, much like Michael Mann does in Heat and Scorsese does in Departed, by juxtaposing Lucas' rise to the powerful heroin magnet he becomes over time, and Roberts continued battle against corruption both within the police and on the streets. The film never lingers on either one for too long, instead choosing to jump between either man's story every few moments. We share their conflicts, and we share their near triumphant moments. But it also brings about a sense of pathos and ethics, in wondering who we should be cheering for, and who we hope wins by the time the blockbuster meeting takes place.But on that same token, the film fumbles over itself. Yes, it is a rivetingly deep story for the most part, but it has more in common with misdirection and red herrings than I would have liked. Characters are continually introduced and brought into the fold, yet nothing really becomes of them (such as Cuba Gooding Jr., who I hope can now use this film as a replacement for half of the garbage listed on his resume after Jerry Maguire). Yes, they do build up the story, and yes, a lot of these events with minor characters help move the film along, but they just do not feel all that needed in the grand scheme of things. A few of the scenes feel like filler just to pad the film into getting prestige status as a three hour epic on par with the greats of the 1970's. It feels a lot like it is cheating itself out of being truly great by playing these scenes up, and really could have felt a lot tighter and stronger if many of these were cut right out of the picture. When the film wants to be electrifying and blazing fast, it is. But in many other cases, it tangles itself up in near boredom inducing sequencing.One reason they feel so unnecessary is the cheapening and misuse of many of the supporting characters. Characters like Gooding Jr.'s Nicky Barnes and Josh Brolin's rival Detective Trupo are clearly important to the film, but they get next to no time to really shine. When the film is not meandering through scenes it does not need, it races through scenes that could have helped strengthen it, especially if it was left at the same running time as it currently sits at. I wanted to know more about these characters, and I wanted to discover their significance. But despite some really great work coming out of these supporting characters (especially from Brolin), the film just does not call for anyone to really care about these characters and their impact on the film. It just seems to care about the Denzel and Russell show more often than not.Washington, in the main character role, is absolutely electrifying as Lucas. The role is his juiciest since Training Day, and he knows it. He plays the character with a smoldering sense of tenderness and downright evil. I have yet to see an actor who could trade the two traits off so interchangeably and so inexplicably easy as Washington does here. I did care what happened to his character and was scared for him, but at the same time, I was terrified of the guy too. He was not someone to mess with, and Washington makes it crystal clear that the man should be feared. Crowe on the other hand, is a bit of a tossup. He is really good here, but only when he wants to be. He looks very unenthused for the majority of the movie, but delivers when the scene asks for it. He is a strong performer no doubt, but his subdued and near unnatural performance does not any chance to stand next to Washington's overpoweringly memorable take equally.While it has story and character issues, the film itself is filmed quite beautifully. Harking back to imagery from the likes of Scarface, The French Connection and The Godfather, American Gangster paints the image of a nitty gritty New York. The film is a very dark picture, and it lends itself to some pretty stark imagery. There is minor light and bright images littered throughout the film, but there is a certain sense of subdued grey that is carried for the majority of it. It definitely felt authentic to the time period, and the details in keeping this way are numerous. Even the costumes have been detailed to a point of timed perfection. Both helped make the film more riveting when it was losing steam quickly.American Gangster, for as much as it does right, does not live up to everything people had hoped for. It has everything the greats have, but it just does not seem to know how to line up all the pieces. It is a worthwhile venture, but not one that needed to be so lengthy.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Superb performances with a compelling story,"This movie has a compelling story, was well directed, superbly cast, and contains performances that will challenge for awards for best actor and supporting actor and actress. Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington were able to overcome their star-power and actually become their portrayed characters to the audience, and Ms. Nadal was a delightful surprise. Not only is she a beautiful woman, but conveyed emotions in a subtle, yet powerful way that is cherished by the camera. Ruby Dee gives a powerful performance, which we expected, and should challenge for supporting actress. Josh Brolin was also a pleasant surprise--already more compelling than James, his portrayal will challenge for supporting actor.

Ridley Scott does it again!,"A wonderful movie with superb acting by Washington and Crowe. I keep hearing people talking about the lack of violence and action in the movie, but it was actually a refreshing thing to see. ""Scarface"" was a good movie, no doubt, but all of the language and blood detracted from the actual story at times. This film was wonderfully written and didn't need violence to give it a very dark atmosphere . It is about corruption and how easily people can fall into it. Frank Lucas was such an intriguing character in this movie and every time he spoke I was drawn into what he had to say. Look for Cuba Gooding Jr. to have a small role in this movie as well, he's great as the very showy club owner.

YOU ARE IDIOTS!!! know why??? because this was based on a true story.... hello.... get that through your thick 'this is so boring and unoriginal' skulls! it is original because it actually happened, plus it happened way before most of the movies your comparing it to were even made. get a life and get the facts straight. This story is an amazing one, it tells us about an actual person who went from being at the bottom to making his way to the top. Frank Lucas went from being a driver to a ""mob boss"" bigger than the Italians; which is a huge deal. This portrayal of Frank Lucas' life was magnificent, Denzel did a fantastic job and portrayed every emotion with complete clarity and utter brilliance. And even though Lucas was kind of a butt face he knew what he wanted and how to get it, he was an advocate for himself, his family and unlike most mobs he had morals and values he stuck with!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Everything there but something's missing...,"My expectations were high for this movie, not only as it related to a favourite genre, the modern gangster film, but also of course the heavyweight talent bringing it to the screen, Scott, Crowe, Washington et.al. For me it didn't quite exceed the sum of its parts but that said there's much to commend it. The story gets back to front with pace and the scene setting is fine, evoking the required mix of ""French Connection"" (namechecked en route), ""Shaft"", ""The Godfather"" and even more recent films like ""Casino"", ""LA Confidential"" and ""The Untouchables"". The film however brings little that is new to the party in terms of plotting which is perhaps the main drawback here, we have sort of seen it all before, from the fable of the underdog protégé gangster rising spectacularly through the ranks, to the Mafia-style placement of family at the centre of Mr Big's (Washington's Frank Lucas) universe, to the taking of a trophy wife, to the ritual violence meted out to rivals and subordinates, plus of course the good versus bad cops and robbers routine as unsullied by vice, Crowe plays off against Washington's sinister well oiled criminal machine. The evocation of late 60's New Jersey and New York is well achieved, with language and fashions to match (a negative mark tho' for the too-obvious musical soundtrack motifs, great as they are, slightly more obscure selections from Bobby Womack, Staple Singers and Sam and Dave would have better grounded the movie in its chosen era), but I found the acting just shy of top-notch, certainly not Oscar-worthy. The twin leads, Crowe and Washington aren't stretched and to me, don't stretch themselves enough in their parts, plus it's fair to say they're given few memorable lines to deliver too. I would also have preferred the Crowe character to be more blemish-free to point up the contrast with Washington's don, (why does every divorce defendant in a Hollywood flick end up in a gratuitous sex-scene with their glamorous female attorney?). The Crowe and Washington characters are held back until the conclusion when they actually share a scene, but again fireworks fail to fly and one almost wishes the actors could have turned back the clocks to when they were less knowing about their craft (c.f. Crowe in ""LA Confidential"", Washington in ""Philadelphia"") and brought more attack to their parts. I'm not sure ""American Gangster"" adds much more than a semi-colon, never mind a postscript to the genre and the film does drag on about 20 minutes too long but there's enough grits and style to get by on here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
masterful director + masterful actors = masterful film,"Once again director Ridley Scott makes a genre film that may very well define that genre for years to come. Based on the real life exploits of Harlem Heroin Kingpin Frank Lucas, and the cop who brought his empire down, this powerful film does an excellent job of recreating the 70s. Russel Crowe delivers a fine performance as cop Richie Roberts, but this is Denzel's film all the way. His prescence on screen carries a weight of calculating, but doomed power. Frank Lucas is one of the most memorable characters I've seen. In a film with nudity, violence, and drug use it all too easily could have become exploitative, but surprisingly these elements are merely necessary parts of the environment in which the characters live. This one's all about the characters. A near perfect Rise and Fall film and contender for several Oscars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Solid crime story, that lacks killer punch.","Based on a true story, this follows the exploits of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), a real- life gangster, and Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), the cop who tries to catch him.The movie's opening is (possibly purposefully) convoluted and the feeling of bewilderment is heightened by the fact that 25% of the characters in the film seemingly have a speech impediment. However, it is the second half of the film where it really takes off; thrusting the viewer into the action, in exciting style.The performances all round are brilliant. Crowe gives his character a believable third dimension, thanks mostly to sacrificing his ego and concentrating on the character's everyman facets; a role that Hollywood actors neglect in favour of the more enticing, fancy, confident, showy characters.But it is Washington's performance that will steal the plaudits - perhaps unfairly. Whilst he is brilliant as the cold, but family orientated, business man/gangster; he is not stunning. Washington often plays parts similarly, whether he plays a crime kingpin, or a cop; that ruthless nature and unpredictability. Like, say, Tom Cruise, he reacts to situations superbly - as well as any actor out there - but it's always the same guy you see behind those eyes.The script and direction, whilst mostly superb, is at times a little mystifying. For instance, Lucas is always telling his brothers not to be too showy and bold and brash (in reference to the clothes they wear, and the way they behave), but when a rival doesn't pay him back, Lucas shoots him in the middle of the street in broad daylight, before returning to the cafe to continue eating his breakfast with his family. A tense, stunning scene, perhaps; but I couldn't help feel it was at odds with the rest of the story and the character itself.It is this lack of cohesiveness throughout that prevents 'American Gangster' from being truly great.Overall, this is certainly worth watching. It's an engrossing crime-romp, bolstered by a stellar cast and good production values, but the inconsistencies throughout slightly damage the overall quality.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Not all that (at least not all that to be in the top 250),"First off, I don't have any idea how this movie landed up in IMDb's top 250 list. The movie could've been much better than it was. It can be understood that Scott was dealing with an era movie, of which he has done many. But the drug infested New York City of the late 60's is definitely not his playground. He relies too much on Denzel's acting skills, which alone are the only thing worth seeing in the movie (Russell can be a much better actor, and here, he sure fails to pull off a decent American accent). The movie tries too hard to fit into many different thematic genres but fails to deliver in any. It tries to be a cat & mouse chase between the cop Russell and the drug lord Denzel, but Russell never brings on the game and two leads end up confronting each other only in the end at which point the story seems to belong somewhere else. The Movie tries to be a full blown gangster movie, but the story never takes off and fails to impress. don't expect the raw energy seen in Scarface, or the wholesome gangster experience in Godfather. The 2 hrs 40 mins could have been put to better use. Instead the viewer is left sitting there expecting a plot twist any moment, but it never happens. The story is unevenly paced, with the first 2 hrs 20 mins. dedicated to showing Denzel's rise to power and a few obstacles here and there. All of a sudden as if due to a shortage of reel, in the next 20 mins you see the police craking down denzels whole operation, sentencing him, getting a little help from him (to catch others involved), and releasing him after 14-15 odd years.. .

My Man,"Greetings again from the darkness. Every now and then we experience the convergence of a creative team who each bring their ""A"" game. Director Ridley Scott has had ups and downs but certainly was focused on this project. Writer Steve Zaillan has delivered a couple of screenplays along the way that were probably nothing more than paychecks. We all know Denzel Washington has been known to work for the money and not the art. This group partners here with acting stud Russell Crowe to remind us of how cool movies can be.One of the more fascinating things about the film is how the two powerful leads don't share a scene until 80% of the film is over. Based on a true story, Denzel plays Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas as a street wise, true to the gangster code, businessman on a mission. It is my favorite Denzel role ever. He moves just like an animal on the prowl, eyes always moving ... until he sends the cold stare at someone before uttering ""My Man"" ... which is usually one of the last things they hear.Crowe is just tremendous as the squeaky clean cop, who sucks as a father and husband, but is true to the code of justice and law. A pariah for turning in a trunk load of untraceable cash, Crowe is moved to a special drug investigative unit and he takes the assignment very seriously indeed! Watching him peel back the layers of the investigation and having it turn on a $50,000 fur coat and microwave oven, really is compelling. Once again, Crowe is at his peak. OK, the guy had a momentary lapse in ""A Good Year"" (directed by Ridley Scott) but his resume is tough to match by most any actor.The supporting cast is stellar and affecting. For some reason, he is not listed in the credits, but Clarence Williams III is Bumpy, Lucas' boss and mentor. Williams is perfect for the tough, yet pensive leader. Josh Brolin (""Grindhouse"") is chilling as the corrupt NY detective. I wanted to shoot him myself. Long lost Armand Assante is captivating as a drug lord who just can't compete with Lucas, so he partners up. Cuba Gooding, jr. escapes from crappy kid movies long enough to play a frightening gangster who loves the spotlight and doesn't enjoy being dissed. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Ruby Dee and Joe Morton all have nice turns as well.The final showdown with Denzel and Crowe reminds a bit of ""Heat"" when Pacino and Deniro FINALLY share a scene. With a touch of ""Serpico"" and ""Blow"", this one adds the touch of dueling codes ... street vs. cop. Just a fascinating (mostly) true story with amazing performances!

Ridley Scott fashions Crowe's intensity and Washington's commandingly cool presence in one of most entertaining crime pictures in ages,"Audiences know a good crime-saga when they see one, as American Gangster brought in $16 million dollars on Friday alone according to showbiz-data.com, setting itself to double the weekend take of last years destined crime-classic The Departed. The proof is in the pudding as famed British director Ridley Scott helms the true life story of drug lord Frank Lucas and the detective on his trail, Richie Roberts in Scott's greatest conceived film since Gladiator. Scott beautifully and brutally orchestrates Russell Crowe's determined and intense Roberts and Denzel Washington's smooth but fierce Lucas, in a sublime crime epic that transcends the genre.Frank Lucas's boss passes away in the beginning of film, prompting him to step into his shoes. Denzel Washington embodies Lucas as a cool commanding criminal who wears business suits rather then super-fly fur coats and jewelry as he adheres to keep a low-profile. Lucas carries profound ideals such as ""the loudest guy in the room is the weakest,"" and that the man who draws the most attention to himself is the one that ends up in jail. He is in a lot of ways the Michael Corleone of Harlem as his intelligence and poise promote fear in his enemies. Although a gentlemen, Lucas is not afraid to conduct vicious acts of violence as he walks up to rival mobsters in broad day light and guns them down. This is one of Washington's most multi-layered characters, and he pulls it off with ease.In noticing the high quantity of narcotics in Asia during the Vietnam War, Lucas immediately gets on a plane for Bangkok to work out a drug trafficking deal to get pure heroin in the United States. By securing this ""product"" he cuts out the middle man, thus causing his power and control to grow. He executes his plan with fortitude as he quickly becomes the city's leading drug lord.Lucas's rise to mafia kingpin paints an engrossing portrait of capitalism in its most distasteful form, as Lucas becomes $150 million dollars richer as his product baffles police, junkies, and other criminals alike with its potency and lower price; and the audience feels the same effect.The late 1960s and early 70s are fleshed out with breathtakingly dark and menacing cinematography. Ridley Scott and cinematographer Harris Savides heighten Gangster's realism as its stage is set upon gritty, foreboding mirages of night clubs and alleyways, where desperate junkies, crooked cops, and criminals loom everywhere. Savides had conveyed such dark gloomy visions in The Game and Zodiac. The screenplay also characterizes the time period with authentic hard clenched dialogue of the streets.The focus on Crowe and Washington's dichotomy leaves out many story lines. We want to have a better sense of Lucas's father relationship with his nephew, and we wonder what happened for Roberts to cause his wife to take away his son. Their unwavering livelihoods however distract Roberts and Lucas from their beloved families, as Lucas is determined through his police work, and Lucas becomes paranoid to protect his business.Much like L.A. Confidential or Miller's Crossing, Gangster delves you into the characters daily lives, where you get a distinguished sense that the world of the criminal and cop are not too far apart. These conflicted worlds of the police officer and criminal are both littered with selfish depravity, greed, and envied power as Lucas and Roberts are surrounded by evil on both sides. This includes a crooked cop, who uses his power to blackmail both Lucas and Roberts, which makes for a captivating twist in this crime epic.Ridley Scott personifies the brutal effect organized crime has on innocent people's lives. Distressing shots of dead parents OD from Heroin inhabit the screen as a motherless child cries alongside her. These apparent scenes heighten the film's realism even more. Lucas's ""product,"" is becoming the city's epidemic as thousands of New Yorkers are able buy his affordable Heroin. These wrenchingly unsettling images prompt the viewer to cheer on honest detective Richie Robert's crusade to rid the city of drugs as he becomes the film's hero. Russell Crowe exemplifies the character's courage and integrity through much evil as his struggle becomes the film's most captivating storyline.American Gangster is intelligent and engrossing as it eloquently takes us through the rise and fall of one of the most notorious crime figures in history. Before you know it, 3 hours go by and you wonder what hit you, maybe it was the gritty dark atmosphere of New York City that was so captivating or maybe it was the dualism of Crowe's intensity and Washington's fierce but commandingly cool attitude, Gangster is simply a crime epic for the ages.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Takes a little while to get going but once it does this true story gets more and more engrossing,"With American Gangster master filmmaker Ridley Scott finds himself in Scorsese territory here uncovering the seedy underbelly of crime in New York in the late 1960's. Based on the true story of black gangster Frank Lucas who imported drugs from Vietnam and sold them on the streets to become rich and powerful in a series of audacious business deals we also follow life at the other end of the scale with honest cop Richie Roberts who patiently sets about uncovering Lucas's operation, as well as police corruption from within, in an effort to bring down the Harlem drug lord once and for all.Following their successful collaboration on Gladiator (2000) Scott reunites with Russell Crowe who gives an understated performance as Richie Roberts while Denzil Washington brings a classy, smooth yet uncharacteristic ruthlessness to playing Frank Lucas, who is a smart and clever businessman on the one hand but a violent criminal on the other who wouldn't think twice about blowing someone's brains out in public if he thought he had been disrespected.The film takes a little while to get going but once it does it cuts from location to location at a fast pace and gets more engrossing as time goes on. Thanks to Scott's assured direction and visual aesthetics in recreating the era, Steven Zaillian's intelligent script and quality acting from two Oscar winners American Gangster is a solid, well made story based on fact and one that I wasn't aware of as movies up to now had focused on the Italian Mafia in movies like The Godfather (1972), Goodfellas (1990) and Once Upon a Time in America (1984). This may not be considered a classic like that those films but Scott delivers a compelling slice of history that needed to be told.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
It feels good to be a Gangster!,"Like many of you I have been disappointed by the movies released so far this year. There have been very few Oscar Contenders and more than that there have been very few movies that will draw people out. I have loved the Game Plan, Across the Universe, Kingdom, Things We Lost in the Fire, Transformers and a few others. But that's a very short list consider about 10 movies come out every single week and it's November.American Gangser has filled a void that I think many cinema goers were missing. The fact that this movie was based on a true story, a plus. The fact that Denzell and Russell meet again after 11 years when they appeared together in Virtuosity, a plus. Back then Crowe was the bad guy and Washington was the good guy. And if you remember that movie, it wasn't good. The fact that American Gangster is directed by Ridley Scott, a plus.The movie draws you in from the very beginning. If you were like you me you were already sold by the trailers. But the fact that this was based on a true story, drew me into the story even further.Washington plays Frank Lucas, a real life American gangster, who takes over organized crime in New York City. His rise to success is simple he uses the formula that any successful corporation uses: ""Cut out the middle man"" That revelation was given to him by his mentor ""Bumpy"" who died in a franchise store while talking about how he misses the middle man. Kinda ironic of how Frank Lucas took over.At the same time you have Crowe who plays Richie Roberts, a cop who is trying to fight corruption in the police force. The movie took an approach of where you follow Frank Lucas and care about him and at the same time you follow Richie Roberts and you care about him.It's kinda odd because you are rooting for both sides. Richie Roberts is a goodie two shoe cop who does everything the right way. Frank Lucas is a ruthless crime boss who wants to do what he cans to help his family.The movie is filmed in a gritty and raw New York/New Jersey. The back drop of the Vietnman war and the American soldiers addiction to narcotics really hit home. It was like a juxtaposition our soldiers are fighting for freedom in a place that is enslaving them with drugs. And not only that they were sending that bondage back home.American Gangster will not be a Scarface or a Godfather, but what makes American Gangster stand alone is that it's just a street story. This movie shows you how easy it is to get caught up on the wrong side and not even realize that you are there.Crowe and Washington will both probably get Oscar nominations for this film, and I think they expect it with the November release.Go see this movie. I must say Hollywood is getting it right. First ""Kingdom"" then ""Across the Universe"", then ""Things we Lost in the Fire"" and now ""American Gangster."" 2007 has a shot of not being the worse movie year ever in history.American Gangster will develop a cult following and I fear it spawn a whole new generation of American Gangsters.I give this movie a 10 out of 10. The only thing I wish they would have done differently, but I'm sure this will be on the DVD is to show the real life Roberts and Lucas who were consultants on the film.""The movie critic who still pays the price of admission"" Go see this film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Irresponsible and Dull,"When I first heard about this film, I was hopeful and expected some pretty good things, but once I started seeing the trailers that all changed.At best I thought it would be an OK film that could wait for a DVD release. Well since I had the chance to see it at no cost to me I went ahead and did so. My instincts were correct, about it not being worth a theater going experience. But I was way off on it being at least OK. It was much worst than expected.By no means did I expect such a dull film. It lacked detail and jumped around in a horribly irresponsible manner. This film depicts a POS that smuggled drugs in the caskets of American soldiers yet glosses over that fact. It doesn't show the rise nor fall of this man in any detail what so ever. In return avoiding depicting the monster that he was, even his acts of violence were shown in a cleaned up matter or off screen all together.And the end can be argued as to showing him in a somewhat positive manner.Not only is the film irresponsible but it takes way to long just to end up saying absolutely nothing at all.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"All style, no substance","American Gangster seemingly has all the ingredients of a great movie: a great story, (multiple) Oscar-winning stars, a very solid supporting cast, and a good director. However, the film is not the sum of its parts.How do you go wrong with a gangster movie starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, and Ridley Scott directing? Watch American Gangster, and you'll see.The film lacks a great deal of character development, and it seems the details on both sides of the story are left out in favor of attention-grabbing scenes and montages.You have to give them credit. Even at 2 1/2 hours, American Gangster never drags. However, it seems awfully abbreviated, as if someone cut out most of the scenes that involved plot/ character development. With those details included, this could have been a 4-hour movie.Overall, American Gangster isn't a bad film. It just isn't the epic, Oscar-winning film it was marketed to be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
My Man! Denzel Washington Delivers Again in American Gangster.,"***Warning!-This summary contains movie information and spoilers. *** I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in Drama, Action, Crime movies. American Gangster in a modern day classic that has an appropriately mixed ensemble cast of well known veteran actors and relatively known supporting cast members.Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe do a superb job in their American Gangster lead roles. This time out, the positions they play are reversed from their previous film together titled Virtuosity. In Amercian Gangster, Frank Lucas (Denzel's character) is on the wrong side of the law while Det. Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) does everything in his power to bring Lucas to justice. Whereas, in their first film together Virtuosity, Crowe was the absconder of justice while Washington assisted the police to bring order to society while pursuing Crowe.I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline, pace, and subject matter of the movie. Veterans Josh Brolin, Ruby Dee, and newcomer Lymari Nadal, all added exceptional performances in their supporting roles to fulfill director Ridley Scott's vision for the storyline.I also noticed the fact that Denzel Washington had worked with the late Ossie Davis in Malcolm X and completed the cycle in American Gangster by starring with Davis's widow Ruby Dee.Unfortunately, I also noticed that their seem to be many Denzel Washington detractors who cannot accept the fact that he won the Oscar for Training Day and therefore they are unable to let the past go. As a result, they infiltrate legitimate movie cites like IMDb and pose as fans in order to post negative comments that are far from the reality of the brilliance of director Ridley Scott and his talented actors in the American Gangster movie cast.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"A great big gangster film, a must watch","Based on the true story of Frank Lucas, American Gangster is a masterpiece.Washington's portrayal of Lucas is multifaceted and compelling, capturing the character's charisma, intelligence, and ruthlessness. Lucas's rise to power is facilitated by his innovative approach to the drug trade, which involves smuggling heroin into the United States via military aircraft.Crowe's performance as Roberts is equally impressive, conveying the character's integrity, determination, and vulnerability. Roberts's pursuit of Lucas is motivated by a strong sense of justice, as well as a personal desire for redemption.American Gangster explores several thought-provoking themes, including:
Lucas's ascent from poverty to wealth and power serves as a twisted commentary on the American Dream, highlighting the darker aspects of capitalism and the corrupting influence of power.The film exposes the rampant corruption within the NYPD and the CIA, underscoring the ways in which institutional rot can enable and perpetuate organized crime.American Gangster sheds light on the devastating impact of the drug trade on individuals, families, and communities, emphasizing the need for a more compassionate and effective approach to addressing addiction.American Gangster is a gripping and thought-provoking crime drama that boasts outstanding performances, meticulous direction, and a richly nuanced screenplay. With its unflinching portrayal of crime and corruption, the film serves as a powerful indictment of the darker aspects of human nature.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"nonsensical, weak rehash of past gangster flicks","I caught a screening of this, and I am completely shocked that this thing has an 8.8 on IMDb. Not a single element of this film was even remotely original, the ""story"" was scatter brained and played out like a bad game of gangster edition madlibs, and the characters were harder to care for than an already dead house plant. It's a perfect example of how, sometimes, a movie's parts can be much better than it's whole. Watched in parts, the film is spectacular, but when those parts are put together, you're left confused as to why anybody in this entire movie does anything they do. The characters are given cheap depth, such as being completely evil 99% of the time, but then, for one out of place scene, they're nice to their mother. Directed by Ridley Scott and starring Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington, this was a very pretty but weak film with an ensemble team of the most overrated players in Hollywood.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great American Crime Drama,"This film was a satisfying and memorable watch.It took a little while to hook me, mostly due to the many characters the film has to introduce and develop to set things in motion.

Each actor did a phenomenal job, and the performances and the setting make this one memorable. Denzel Washington especially did a fantastic job with the main character Frank Lucas, but the cast is star-studded and everyone puts in a great performance.The ending was satisfying and pulled everything together nicely.Overall, I was definitely invested in the plot.

Same ol' Gangsta,"Frank Lucas: The loudest one in the room is the weakest one.That's some solid advice from an unflappable, businessman/innovator who also happens to house an unshakable tyranny beneath his nondescript black overcoat. The man is Frank Lucas  a North Carolina-born crime boss who sold top quality heroine at discount-store prices to the good people of Harlem in the late 1960's and '70's. The advice would have been better taken than given as one loud moment, one indulgence in pride and riches, would ultimately lead to his unraveling. Having accepted an innocent gift from his beautiful wife, Lucas arrived at boxing title bout in a pimped-out chinchilla fur coat and matching fedora. All eyes were drawn to the man who dressed with such impeccable flare and had better seats than some of the highest profile gangsters in all of New York City. One of these sets of eyes belonged to Richie Roberts, a Jersey detective who was heading a covert task force determined to make big moves in the war on drugs. Before this, Richie didn't even know whom he was hunting but now he at least knew where to start looking. That moment is now a pivotal scene in Ridley Scott's American GANGSTER, a juxtaposition of Lucas's rise and demise offset against the blind pursuit to bring his untouchable operation to its knees.American GANGSTER is (aside from seeming like a blatant attempt on Scott's part to latch on to some of the residual success from Scorsese's return to glory with THE DEPARTED) an exploration of the vast field of gray between what is supposed to be the clear black and white ends of the law spectrum. Lucas (a fiercely calculated Denzel Washington) hands out turkeys to his Harlem brethren while getting their children hooked on some of the purest heroine on the streets. Roberts (a disheveled and determined Russell Crowe) refuses to play into the dirty cop stereotype, even going so far as handing close to a million dollars into his superiors, but disrespects his ex-wife and disregards his responsibilities as a father. Still, both see themselves as examples that should be followed because they follow a strict life code built on core American values like integrity and hard work. What neither understands about themselves or each other is that abiding by such a rigid set of guidelines for a successful life touches every facet of your image, from where you live to what you eat for dinner to how you treat your family. Not to mention, while they spend so much time defining themselves as model Americans, they lose their individuality.Both Washington and Crowe are impressive performers, each boasting past experience that would make them clear choices for the roles they were cast as in American GANGSTER. Washington, having done twisted and unpredictably violent in TRAINING DAY, now takes a more stoic approach to evil as he is unflinching even when lighting someone on fire only to shoot them in the head seconds later. (I guess he just needed to be sure his last moments alive were spent in agony.) Crowe, having played the manly cop in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, brings a certain nervous uncertainty to the authority figure icon. Each is capable of carrying a film on his own and, in American GANGSTER, they each essentially have to as the two share the screen for what amounts to maybe ten minutes. In what is perhaps Scott's greatest movie magic trick, he splits the film into two distinct pieces that exist on their own but depend on each other for purpose. While Roberts runs around the city chasing after L ucas, he never knows that it is Lucas he is actually gunning for. At the same time, Lucas never knows Roberts is after him until it is too late.All that stands between Crowe and Washington now is Ridley Scott. There is no contesting American GANGSTER's ferocity but its dynamism is severely overrated. Good cops and bad cops have been done to death (although none nearly as delicious as the sleazy turn by Josh Brolin as the crooked cop ringmaster) and the same can be said for bad guys who love their mothers. By now, we all know the world is gray but strong performances, a sharp 70's visual style and companion soundtrack do their best to distract us from seeing that we aren't really learning anything new. The action moves into the clubs. The threads are slick; the tunes are smooth; the club is definitely swinging but the scene is getting tired.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Every action has a consequence,"Drug and violence themes are touched upon in this film, which makes this film very entertaining.The story of this film shows that the drug business is extremely violent, as well as the conflict between suppliers, it also exposes that even if this business makes you earn a lot of money, the life of a person who is addicted will always be ruined. It also shows that a corrupt police officer is much more dangerous than the drug dealers themselves. Although it also shows that there are police officers who are interested in the welfare of the population and not just in the money. The film is bloody, it has excellent performances, the music helps you feel in this world of drug dealing, as does the production design, it has good character development and the bloody scenes are very well edited, but the action scenes don't look very good.This film not only manages to present an entertaining story about an issue that affects society, but also manages to give a strong message that every action has its consequences that sooner or later you will have to pay.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Boom Operator should get top billing for most screen time,I saw the film Near Palm Springs and the boom dipped into the shot at least 15 times. For a while there I thought it was going to have more screen time than Denzel or Russell. One time half the boom microphone was visible. Having said that though I though it was great and Denzel and Russell both showed why they have the gold men on their fire places. I love to watch Denzel on screen...amazing! I never knew this character existed but he was an interesting man in many ways. I love to learn about all types of history and film is my chosen method. I will see this one again I think.

"Nothing new or too deep , but very entertaining","American gangster"" is a gangster movie that doesn't add anything new to the genre . It's weaker than classics such as ""Godfather"" , ""Godfather 2"" , ""Goodfellas"" or ""Casino"" , yet it's a strong movie on it's own . To be honest it isn't pure gangster movie . The story of cop Richie is just as important as the story of gangster Frank . In a way the movie reminds kinda Michael Mann's ""Heat"".The movie is long and epic . The whole picture has a ""French Connection"" feel. It's an entertaining portrait of late 60s-early 70s Harlem and America. Lots of drugs , Vietnam war , desperation , world where cops are as dirty (or even dirtier) than gangsters. As Richie says at one point of the movie all those cops , judges , lawyers , district attorneys are really too happy with the fact that drugs exist , because it gives them work. Lawlessness and organized crime exists because of the mutual benefit that the gangsters have with the law . No one, including the law, wants it to stop. The movie offers real-life look into the narcotics business top-to-bottom and across the board. It also shows what it means to be a cop and to strive for something.The story is based on true life of Frank Lucas who here isn't a stereotypical black gangster gone wrong , but instead an elegant, intelligent man who rises to the top. Denzel Washington shines here . He's menacing , confident , cold and feisty. In my opinion he did a good job making his character different than the bad guy he portrayed in ""Training day"". ""American gangster"" is also a story of Ritchie Roberts , a cop who defeated him. He's character is much less interesting , since he's basically a boy scout , yet Russell Crowe manages to create a likable character . He was able to convince me about the pure innocence of his character. Roberts and Lucas may be operating on opposite sides of the law, the one thing that both men have in common is a strict code of ethics that separates them from their opportunistic colleagues.The movie also has interesting supporting characters . Josh Brolin turns in an outstanding and memorable performance as Trupo, a decidedly sinister and shady cop . Ruby Dee rightfully deserved the Oscar nomination for her role of Lucas mother . It was good to see Cuba Gooding Jr. in a good movie with a good performance for a change. Chiwetal Ejifor makes a believable side character. Armand Assante gives a god performance as the mob boss.""American gangster"" is truly engrossing and captivating picture that I did not once find it boring or slow at all. The pacing to was just right to have enough of a character study going on, but also enough to keep audience interested and entertained. Ridley Scott did a great job as the director . He also improved as an action director - police raid scene is really great.This movie is a good addition to the genre of gangster movies . We haven't yet seen a really good movie with black gangster until this one. I give it 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Greater things,"If Denzel Washington did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him. I guess while we're add it we just might as well throw Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe onto the ""necessary inventions"" list. Reason being is that we need people like them. We need people who can embody and portray things greater than the average man. Now on a personal level Denzel Washington (and others like him) is just a person like you and me. He gets up, eats breakfast, goes to work and occasionally thinks of a crude joke. Nevermind the fact that he gets $20 million per assignment, that's just his good fortune. Fact is, that when he is on screen, often times, he isn't just Denzel anymore. He's an encapsulating presence that you're fascinated by. Or in this case of portraying Frank Lucas, intimidated by. He portrays a ruthless, calculating and clever business man (aka a gangster), but Frank Lucas also embodies a certain sense of virtue. He may be greedy and treacherous in his methods, but he has a strong sense of diligence and honor. In one scene Lucas says, ""The most important thing in business is honesty, integrity, hard work... family... never forgetting where we came from."" That's something every working man should adhere to.Yet why are so many tales of honor and virtue about criminals? People who by definition have too little or none? In this case I think the definition is wrong, they don't too little, they have a lot in fact. But they get things done their way. Honor among thieves. They may rob and corrupt (Frank Lucas was far from being an angel) but the fact remains they know how to get things done and get it done real good. That is the primary fascination we have with people who venture beyond our established laws and say ""I'm gunna do it my way."" The leap from the rules allows them to create their own laws, their own crimes, and as they form they are seen at the essence for what they are, which is the same old virtue and vice most of us deal with.The other side of the spectrum is Ritchie Roberts, the man trying to bring Frank Lucas down and he is in a way similar. He is given charge of a special police unit for the job. Ritchie is fascinating just like Frank Lucas, he gets things done his way despite being on the right side of the law. The fascinating climax of the film has these two powerful opposing forces meeting for the first time. However, that's where my only complaint with the film is. The scene is, well, brief. They meet, make eye contact and then boom, next scene. Naturally the scene would be brief, especially in a movie, since from watching the movie we all know what is going to happen as the film has only been building up to this for two hours. However to better capture the intensity of that scene something more could have been done.Though, by the time the film is over, a very brisk two and half hours I might add, you'll be ready to put this on the shelf next to Scorsese's best crime film's. --- 9/10Rated R for violence, profanity, and drug use.

Give Ridley an Oscar now - 71  and on a mission,"What a sumptuous, intelligent, snappy, sensual movie.I feel Ridley Scott has a great eye for beauty; and I was pulled up recently when I said he has the capacity to make violence sexy. Ooops. There are often moments when I like to think he chooses to visually seduce his audience.This is a movie when I feel he is on fire or perhaps Sir Ridley you may laugh at this comment and think ""Phew, I'm a little tired.'. Of course, the actors are there and behave impeccably (as they should)because they are the sum of things and lucky enough to have a good guiding eye.American Gangster is a beautifully paced, gangster/cop movie which manages to slide between intimacy, peoples, locations and intense emotions, not all violent. Violent people are capable of love, loving people are capable of violence and those on the take are capable of anything.

corruption is life,"When I started watching ""American Gangster"", I had no idea what it was about. By the end, I was surprised that I had never heard the story before.The first character whom we meet is Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), confidante of Harlem gangster extraordinaire Ellsworth ""Bumpy"" Johnson (Clarence Williams III). Lucas's first scene makes him look like a heartless killer, but we soon see that he does have friends and can be a nice guy. When Johnson dies in 1968, Lucas becomes head honcho in Harlem. But simply being the big cheese isn't enough for this guy. So he starts another business venture: drug trafficking. The ongoing Vietnam War enables Lucas to import heroin from Indochina, and before long he practically runs Harlem. Part of his aim is to stamp out corruption in his inner circle.Meanwhile Det. Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) has his own stuff going. While going through a divorce, he seeks to bring down Lucas's drug empire, and at the same time dealing with corruption in his own ranks. So here we have these two men mired in slimy settings, both trying to make good. Well, as good as is possible in this sordid world that they inhabit.For me, the movie's main strength was focusing on this topic. Since I had never known about any of this stuff, any concentration on it will be good. Beyond that, the movie does a pretty good job with its various topics. Granted, the breadth of the focus makes it hard for the movie to delve too deeply into any particular topic, but I felt fulfilled just learning about what happened. No, it's not the greatest movie ever (I consider ""Blade Runner"" Ridley Scott's best ever). But I would still recommend it. Also starring Ruby Dee.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

The only drawback which I felt was that other characters were not given proper focus and their character development should've been given equally importance.The length of the film is of 3 hours but despite of it's length the film will keep you engaged. Acting is strong and not only Denzel and Crowe other cast were equally impressive specially Josh Brolin and Late Ruby Dee and only in my opinion Josh Brolin deserved a little more screen space.The climax of the film gives a good ending to the film, if you are a fan of gangster film genre then this is the film for you.

A Solid Crime Drama,"Ain't no love in the Harlem city...so it goes with American Gangster, a film about the rise and fall of famed drug-lord, Frank Lucas, played by Denzel Washington and the turmoil of the cop, Detective Richie Roberts, played by Russell Crowe, assigned to his case. At heart, this is a film about gangsters and is Scott's attempt at making the African-American Goodfellas. While the premise and the performances dialed in are both strong, the film strolls along a little too casually, and slowly begins to wear down the viewer (and not in a good way).American Gangster is naturally based upon true events, seeing as most films nowadays do require some external inspiration. Nonetheless, the premise and characters presented are not only good on paper but are fairly well executed in the film. The story moves up and down the locales of New York City and delves into criminal themes such as corruption, redemption, and revenge. Frank Lucas was written into the film with such a mystique, that is reminiscent of old gangster mob heads. With that said, the story feels like a rehash at times and the crew has simply changed the names of the characters. There is a certain lack of originality here. The chase against Lucas, led by Detective Richie Roberts, is the important counter story to Frank's. At times, the Roberts sequences can get boring and at times, it felt like the writers did not have enough material for Crowe to work with.Having said that, both star actors turn in wonderful performances, marred only by their lack of originality. At times, I felt like I was watching Alonso from Training Day. I also felt that at times, I was watching Eliot Ness trying to catch Al Capone. Both actors are great and do what they can with the roles, but the characters have been seen so many times before and have been done so well before, that their performances aren't quite as powerful. There are great supporting performances such as the one by Josh Brolin, portraying the corrupt Detective Trupo. In terms of the cast, Scott and his crew pretty much nailed it with the rapper T.I. even getting some screen time.The film does however, tend to drag at times. The ending is prolonged and could have been finished a lot faster. It felt like it was being stretched out just for the sake of it. There were some scenes that were just pointless and unnecessary. However, some scenes were brilliant such as the raid on Lucas' drug ""plant."" The music is a nice blend between urban and hip-hop culture effectively purveying the shifting music culture of New York City in the 70's. In fact, the film does a fairly good job of capturing the whole 70's New York City culture and it is visually and audibly astounding at times. There's not a lot of instrumental work here, which is a shame, but there was a lot to like about the music, anyways.In the end, Ridley Scott creates a solid film about crime and drugs and the rise of African American drug-lords. The film, however, is not very original and it takes a lot of concepts from previous gangster films. The performances, while great, are similarly branded with this lack of originality and it just felt a little too much like the same rigmarole. To make me truly love this film, Scott had to make it a little more special than he did. As it is, the film is a little too run-of-the-mill. The film is certainly not bad; like I said, the film does a good job dealing with the element of criminality and the police trying to stop it. But there have been too many other gangster and crime dramas that have done better and more importantly, have stood out more as something special.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

slick but ultimately boring,"This is a beautifully directed film that is without a point or a theme and is about unpleasant people. Both leads do a good job but are woefully miscast. The visuals are dazzling but it's impossible to care about anyone. You follow a 70's heroin dealer, played by Washington, and the honest but emotionally bankrupt cop who is after him, played by Crowe. As a result, unlike the Godfather, you never are rooting for either character. The drug dealer is glorified, his amoral acts painstakingly justified by events in his past, when in fact this is a man who imported vast amounts of a deadly drug that decimated the culture and hope of his own people. The cop is friendless, sells out his only buddy, is unemotional when that buddy is killed, and is shown neglecting his son and screwing random one night stands over and over. If you didn't get the point the first time, hold on, you'll have seven more chances to get it. The first hour is entertaining enough, although any intelligent viewer will squirm at the idolization of Denzel's drug dealer. After that, the middle is repetitive and drags. I have no clue what the screenplay is trying to say, or what the director believes the film to be about. I wonder if Denzel Washington would like his children to admire the character he plays as much as he seems to.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
It got better by the minute,"I'm speechless; I was pleasantly surprised. Especially because, given the oversaturation of gangster films, the genre often becomes overly heavy and depressing. However, Ridley Scott's vision brings a glimmer of hope to the subject, showing that there are people willing to do the right thing-or at least try. Additionally, it's impossible to deny the talent of the entire cast, even in roles as seemingly minor as those of Joe Morton, Cuba Gooding Jr., and even Idris Elba. That says a lot about this story, as it's clear everyone wanted to be part of it-and they were right to. Not only was the script phenomenal, but the audiovisual execution was flawless.Knowing, to some extent, Ridley Scott's work, I shouldn't have doubted him.

"A Great, Great Gangster Film","No Oscar nominations for Washington, Crowe, or Scott? Are you fricking kidding me? And I was becoming convinced that the Academy had turned things around with its celebration of Martin Scorsese's The Departed. Washington's performance of Frank Lucas is twice as good as his portrayal of Alonzo in Training Day. What are we getting tired of phenomenal performances? This is Crowe's best work since ""A Beautiful Mind"" people. And what about Ridley Scott, he hasn't been right on the money like this since Gladiator. And what does this film get? Two nominations. Not eight, not five, two. This is the film to buy this year, alongside We Own the Night and Gone Baby Gone. I admit, I don't love every single film that Denzel has done but I can't ever question the quality of his performances, even if I didn't like that particular picture. But I loved this one.

The Review: American Gangster,"The always brilliant Ridley Scott has given us yet another gem, but not a diamond.""American Gangster"" starts out with a man being burned alive, and it goes well from there. That may sound like a bizarre way to start a review, but what I mean is that it starts very exiting.The movie delves deep into two parallel stories beautifully woven together , if not slightly overlengthed. Denzel Washington is great as usual, but he is even better as a bad guy. He has that great blend of bad guy and family man, while Russel Crow gives a great (but, not as good as good as Denzel's) performance to counter him.The film goes great throughout but never builds any emotion in you for the characters, so when emotion is called in for, the film kind of flattens a bit, but the film is still one of the best of the year.Rating: ***1/2 (of 4)Entertaining: ***** (of 5)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Ridley Scott is no Scorsese.,"Make no mistake, American Gangster is a very well-made, brutal and intense crime epic that covers the span of time under the rule of Frank Lucas, perhaps the first African-American to fully rule the drug underworld of New York City by himself without the support of another family. Still, all I could think while watching this was that it couldn't compare to The Godfather or Goodfellas. I'm sure Ridley Scott, a fine director in his own respect, wasn't trying to make a film comparable to those, but it still feels like the true story was put together in the same those were. The acting here is strong with Denzel Washington giving a calm, cool and calculating performance as Lucas, who perceives himself as more of a businessman than a drug dealer. Russell Crowe is also very good as a straight cop who has a terrible personal life but follows his job exactly by the book. The supporting characters are good and the cinematography perfectly captures the tough, gritty streets of New York and Newark during the 1970s. I did like this as an entertaining film, but in the end, it takes a course so similar to Goodfellas I couldn't believe it. I guess it did have to follow the way the real story occurred to be realistic, but it still copies the outline from a much better film. To be blunt, Ridley Scott is no Martin Scorsese or Francis Ford Coppola, and despite all the good stuff from this, I prefer the much more stylistic directing of Scorsese or the powerful storytelling of Coppola.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

GoodHomies,"I enjoyed the movie, but an original masterpiece it ain't. Frank's (Denzel W's)explosive and irrational character is basically a black version of Warren Beatty's BUGSY and the rest of the movie is full of clichés' that we've seen a hundred times before; they simply substitute the stereotypical Italian character with a black man. Particularly strange was Frank's dialect going from ""ghetto black"" to Harvard educated white(depending on his mood).But for me, what really separates this movie from the true American gangster classics (Godfather or Goodfellas), is they were based on fact; American Gangster is pure fiction. Not a mention of the racial tensions of the early 70's, in fact we are supposed to accept that no brow is raised over Frank marrying a non-black girl; even momma declares ""she's the most beautiful woman in the world"". Frank's family, inner circle and entire world is an organized and well run fictional BLACK euphoria ... emphasis on the word FICTIONAL.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Good crime story based on a true story...,"1st watched 4/22/2009 – 6 out of 10 (Dir-Ridley Scott): Good crime story based on a true story about a drag trafficking African American man, played by Denzel Washington, in the late 60's who started a heroin business smuggling drugs from Vietnam through military personnel. He worked with his cousin to find the purest form of the drug and get it smuggled in shipments to the U.S. and employed others in his family to distribute it. He formed a company around his family similar to other mafia groups and used some of the same violent tactics to keep himself on top. Russell Crowe plays a detective who puts together a group to sniff out the drug lords and the characters run parallel to each other in the story until near the very end. The story is gritty and told well with good acting although there's not a lot of positive things to hang onto(I guess that's the nature of the story, though). The matter-of-fact way of storytelling works at times but not at others. The movie is slow at the beginning but it eventually pulls you in and gains your attention. I also like the way the director showed how each character didn't really receive their due rewards till the very end. The good guy had bad times and the bad guy lived it up most of the movie which is unfortunately more the way it is in real life. The ending is a little bit corny when the characters hook up to put bad cops in jail, but I guess they had to throw in something positive. All in all this was a good movie, but not great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Ridley Scott succeeds in showing a confused humanity within the gangster true story motif,"No one could or would believe that a black man, a former chauffeur, had risen above the Italian mafia to quietly rule the east coast heroin industry. It's the Frank Lucas story glorified a bit by Denzel Washington being Denzel Washington. Director Ridley Scott poses Russell Crowe's Narc as a polar opposite of his target, unbeknown to him for the majority of the film, making it easier to like, no less enjoy, Denzel's portrayal. Our bad cops, run by Josh Brolin, further places our lone good cop unto the island of himself. The ex-wife custody scenes even further isolates our protagonist. When issues are black and white, he can easily make the right decision. Add in some gray and he's wishy washy. On the flip side of the coin, there is no loyalty but to Franks' old boss' ideals... meaning these guys are very much alike in that manner. The drama is superb and there is a well done early 1970's feel to this crime story, constantly interacting with Viet Nam footage, that make this an underrated gem!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
The Black Scarface,"This movie is a true story based on the life of an African-American drug dealer rising through the ranks of New York drug dealers, using his charm, intelligence and sheer determination to overcome any obstacle to live the American dream. Sound Familiar? The best way to describe this film is a toned-down version of Scarface. Not as gritty and ""in your face"". Volatile but not very violent. Aggressive but not explosive. Interesting but not thrilling.In the end, it goes a long way to be extremely entertaining but falls short of being gripping. It lacks the charisma and rawness of Scarface and the result is a low-impact but extremely watchable gangster movie.It delivers your staple gangster diet of shootings, threats, revenge-taking, power-trips and ""what you gonna do about it sucka?"" lines that you crave so much as a gangster movie lover. With the added bonus of showing you not only how powerful a man can become but also the price he pays for it. Or does he? Definitely worth watching to find out.I'm a great gangster movie fan and I watched this movie purely based on the fact that I thought Denzel Washington would make a fantastic gangster. I saw his performance in Man On Fire and thought he is ideally suited to play a cool, collected and deadly man. He plays the role more like a professional hit-man than a loud gangster. Class and dignity is a key theme.Crowe throws in a good performance too but more forgettable. They're both Oscar winners but they lack the enigmatic factor. Don't get me wrong...the acting is descent but you get the feeling that the movie is somewhat saved by the actors, not by the acting itself. The headlining A-list names attract you, not their performances in the role. They've both had much better roles in the past (Training day, Gladiator etc). In other words you wouldn't go to see this movie if it were Ted Danson and Louis Gossett Jr in the main roles but you would be equally entertained when watching the movie itself?You will enjoy this film because you love gangster movies and because there hasn't ever been a decent African-American gangster movie made until this one. It is worth watching but don't expect a masterpiece.Ultimately you will be very aware throughout the film that you're only watching it to find out what happens to the main character, not because the movie is good.I'm giving it a 7/10 but only because I know you'll enjoy watching it if you're a gangster movie lover.

The movie of 2008,"This was probably the most I'd looked forward to seeing a movie for 6-12mths. It was about gangsters, was based on a true story and had to 1st class actors in Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington.

"Even In the Drug Trade, Ethics, Stereotypes and Practices Can Run You Out of Business","American Gangster is an enormous entertainment, one of the contemporary gangster epics, and a terrific one-year-later follow-up to the 2006 mob opus The Departed. However, it's tough to give this movie the ceiling rating I badly want to give it, the 10 I tend to give the American gangster film, which generally gives me some of the most thrilling satisfaction I ever get from film, because Ridley Scott's adaptation of Frank Lucas's life is softened around the edges by purely Hollywood production values. The film is not shot with a particularly expansive creative eye but rather with the coverage-themed American studio approach and an intermittent amount of very standard character looks. Nevertheless, American Gangster is still cracklingly pleasurable.It is blessed with a wonderful soundtrack, as has come to be a compulsion in the gangster genre. The film is rich with that heaving funk energy of its late '60s, '70s era. Sam & Dave, The Staple Singers, and Bobby Womack blare exciting classics that pump the movie's spirit, and Anthony Hamilton, in a lusciously visceral nightclub scene, sings a wonderful song masterfully fashioned to adapt to the film's period.Also, Denzel Washington, whose presence drives nearly the entire movie, finds an infinite amount of comfort in a role that just may be a niche for him. Firstly, he's very becoming. It's not long before we're lost in the world of cold, ingeniously pragmatic, Frank Lucas, a multi- faceted man beyond the limitations of such an impersonal demeanor. Secondly, Washington is pleasing to watch. It's just a joy, as it tends to be with villains, to be in his subjectively honorable and increasingly unaligned company.Russell Crowe, in more of a supporting role than opposite, does not stand out as he did, again so pleasingly, as the villain in 3:10 To Yuma, however beyond the standardization of his hero character, a disheveled, unorthodox, womanizing cop, there is a very amiable person that he fleshes out. There is one particular scene that I love for its implicit theme: While the rest of Detective Richie Roberts's (Crowe) clan of undercover street cops are watching a boxing match, Roberts, despite sitting amongst them, has his mind somewhere else and to me somehow seems more refreshingly individual than the rest of them. What makes Roberts the irregular hero that at least nearly matches the presence of the villain is his offbeat style of everything. No matter how many corny Hollywood good guy scenes he's given early in the film, the character shines through.Really, most of American Gangster's minor faults, such as Carla Gugino's character, the wife of Crowe who criticizes him passionately for being too wrapped up in his work, are protected by the fact that it's a true story.The movie may ride roughshod over many spots Ridley would've benefited from more carefully constructing, but inscrutable are its starpower, gritty twilight scenes of New York and New Jersey, vast scope, and tremendous climax, a razor-sharp heartpounder of violence, quick cuts, and drama which makes you feel like leaping out of your seat to applaud. Predominantly, there is an undeniably savory taste left in one's mouth, especially after the powerful final shot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Disappointing but not completely awful crime film,"""American Gangster"" is Ridley Scott's latest film that centers on the leader of a drug cartel and a detective dedicated to curtailing drug dealing. Though the story is based on true events, no doubt viewers will find parallels with other better crime films. The parallel that strikes me the most is with ""Heat"" (1995), which also portrays a crime story from the perspective of a detective and a criminal leader, but much more engagingly. ""American Gangster"" isn't an awful film per se, but it could have been better considering the talent involved.The film does feature solid performances. Russell Crowe is effective as a relentless and incorruptible yet womanizing and sometimes quick to anger detective. Denzel Washington is also effective in his role as a self-assured and tough criminal leader. Both actors are acting in familiar territory and I wasn't surprised by the characterizations, but they were effective none the less. The supporting performances were also notable, especially Josh Brolin as a despicable crooked police detective.The film's story is where this film could have been improved. The film's premise is a good one and it is well-developed initially. The ending sequence starting with an investigation of a plane is tense and effective. There is a memorable scene where Crowe and Washington sit down and discuss their situation which recalls ""Heat"", though the scene in ""Heat"" is superior. The way they incorporated reports of Vietnam into the film was effective and as were the scenes featuring the troubled family life of Crowe's character. It is the middle of the story that could have been improved. While there are some notable scenes in that portion, it seemed overlong overall and more tedious than it should be.

"In all honesty, American Gangster was mediocrity at it's finest.","The film starts out with some fire. Then it turns into a dialogue ridden, action deprived, prolonged film about drug trafficking and those who oppose it. Many of the story lines are unnecessary and bloat the film.The acting was okay. Denzel was, well, Denzel. You've seen it before; it's just he's in a 60-70s suit. Russell Crowe was good because he was a perfect match for the part. However, it's not his best performance and if he's nominated I'll be surprised. Lots of cameos and a hell of a cast behind them.The action was good but it was sparse. Lots of stake outs with little to no action. There were little spurts of action through out the movie but the total time of action was probably around 10 minutes. That is, until the end. The action that did happen at the end - way too late - was top notch and lasted about 10 minutes. It was tense and well shot.The resolution was perhaps the best part of the film, mainly because it happened at a faster pace than all the bloated and unnecessary building of the sides.In all honesty, American Gangster was mediocrity at it's finest. Has some very good craftsmanship. You'd expect that from Ridley Scott. But, alas, it has some of the worst. The contrived dialogue and slow pace are the two worst things. The visible (I hope we got an early print.) boom mic was horrendous. It's like they didn't even try to edit that or cover it up. Sad.The bottom line is that it's over-hyped.

American Great Movie,"I knew next to nothing about this movie before renting it, and when I saw that it was running at close to three hours, I expected to be colossally bored by another vanity epic. But then I was riveted, my head blew off and my eyes melted. I sat transfixed in front of the tube not thinking about the time, and after the titles rolled I started to watch the director's-comments version until I was forced into bed because the birdies started to tweet outside. What a movie.Ridley Scott simply strikes a right balance between action and authenticity. It's like a triple whopper with extra onions which is entirely made out of organically harvested yogurt. OK, that sounds gross but you get the point.While it's the many garish scenes of action, sex and brutality that keep the viewer's interest (let's be honest, folks), many of the subtler scenes stuck with me. For example when crime don Lucas buys his mother a lavish home (a gangster movie staple, big gangsters always buy their mum a nice house), there is also a brief scene in which he shows her a dresser he has had made for her, which is a copy of one which the family has had repossessed many years ago. Or later there is a brief scene where his mother tries to set him straight for planning to murder a bunch of cops. Or how Lucas chats up his later wife. These scenes strike home amidst all the mayhem.Another thing that this movie gets right is that it shows Lucas as being, maybe very clever, but not a criminal mastermind. He does make mistakes, and they do come after him. And while he may think of himself as a gentleman, we also see his unbridled brutality lurking under this veneer.Two things which I didn't ""buy"" from this movie:* the scene where Frank Lucas shoots a rival point blank in the head and in coram publico: that would be a pretty stupid thing to do as murder isn't exactly legal, not even in New York City, and Lucas isn't stupid.* Richie Roberts and the women: Roberts is the hard man women think is good to find. I get it. But the endless stream of foxy attorneys and salacious stewardesses who beg him to ""Furp me like a cop"" is just a bit too puerile (or maybe I'm jealous).Anyway, great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Top notch gangster picture,"In what is possibly the best gangster picture since ""Goodfellas,"" Denzel Washington stars as Frank Lucas, a real life drug lord who reigned over Harlem from the late 1960's to the early 1970's. Lucas rose to prominence when he began buying his supplies directly from a military connection in war torn Vietnam, allowing him to push a ""purer"" product at a cheaper price than any of his mob competitors. Russell Crowe plays Richie Roberts, an ""honest cop"" from New Jersey who leads an undercover investigation into the source of all this suddenly abundant street heroin, a search that ultimately leads him to Lucas himself.As written by Steven Zaillian (derived from an article by Marc Jacobson) and directed by Ridley Scott - two old pros who certainly know how to craft a quality movie - ""American Gangster"" is an epic tale of crime and punishment that pays due homage to all the classic gangster pictures that have come before it. Americans have always had a love/hate relationship with law breakers and gangsters. Although we may be appalled by their callous indifference to the suffering of others, we can't help but admire their steely-eyed determination and entrepreneurial spirit, as well as their ability to turn the American Dream on its head with impunity (until they're finally caught that is). And Lucas is no exception, for here is the classic figure of gangster mythology - a boy from the streets who rises from obscurity to command his own empire, only to have it crumble before his very eyes when his own hubris and overreaching prove too much even for the gods themselves to countenance. In a strange moral paradox, much as we may like to see gangsters succeed, we also like to see them brought low and given their just desserts - if for no more morally admirable reason that that we envy them. Lucas comes replete with that special cognitive dissonance that all gangsters seem to possess, and which allows them to live two entirely separate and compartmentalized lives, free of the guilt and hypocrisy that keep the rest of us duty-bound and law-abiding. For despite his ferocious temperament, indifference to human suffering, and callow willingness to exploit human tragedy for his own personal gain, Lucas protects his neighborhood, dotes on his mother and family, and loves his wife.Ironically, Roberts, the cop, has less worth celebrating in his own life - his wife is divorcing him and moving with their son to Las Vegas, his fellow cops don't trust him (for the reason that he ISN'T on the take), and his hopes of becoming a defense attorney may come to naught if he can't conquer his paralyzing fear of public speaking. Yet, Roberts has one thing going for him that Lucas doesn't - he knows the difference between right and wrong, even though he doesn't always act on that knowledge when it comes to his own personal (as opposed to professional) life.Yet what truly distinguishes ""American Gangster"" from its recent movie counterparts - more even than the storyline or characterizations - is the tremendous amount of texture Zaillian and Scott bring to the picture. Every scene is filled with intense interactions between characters, intriguing background information (especially the TV reports from Vietnam), and spot-on period details. And even though Washington and Crowe appear together only in the closing moments, their powerhouse performances make the two concurrently running stories feel all of a piece. It should also be noted that, for a gangster picture, ""American Gangster"" doesn't feel the need to wallow in excessive violence or gratuitous sadism. It is much more concerned with the people involved than with their on-the-job activities.As with even the best of movies these days, ""American Gangster"" could use a little trimming in its later stages, where it suffers a bit from distention and attenuation. Moreover, the final scenes feel a trifle implausible and pat despite the fact that they are reportedly based on fact.Still, these are minor shortcomings in a movie that is firing on all cylinders for most of its running time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
An iconic addition to the gangster genre that is an absolute must see,"American Gangster (2007) is a gem that I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Netflix. The storyline follows a Carolinas based young black man, Frank Lucas, who comes to New York and becomes the driver for Bumpy Johnson. Bumpy teaches him every discipline he needs to know to be a successful drug lord and run the business after his passing. When Bumpy passes away, Lucas takes over his business, something law enforcement never sees coming. When a task force is put together to eliminate drug trafficking, Lucas will be tested on how much he learned from Johnson.This movie is directed by icon Ridley Scott (Alien) and stars Denzel Washington (Training Day), Russell Crowe (Gladiator), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men), Ted Levine (Silence of the Lambs), Roger Guenveur Smith (Dope) and Cuba Gooding Jr. (Jerry Maguire).Everything about this movie is a 10/10. The storyline is intricate, smart and very well written. The fact this is based on a true story made this even more fascinating. There are so many interesting subplots built in - the part the Vietnam war played in the storyline, the level of corruption within the police force, the government's part in the entire situation, etc. The actions of the characters are unpredictable and very well executed. The dialogue is great but the acting is even better. Washington and Crowe are outstanding, but every side character is notable, from the small bit parts to the major costars, they're all A+ actors. The soundtrack is outstanding and fits the movie perfectly. The ending shootout and how everything concludes was perfect.Overall, this is an iconic addition to the gangster genre that is an absolute must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Excellent film, nothing new, but a great film nonetheless","This film is superb, loved every minute of it, the cast, the scenery, everything. The story is a simple one, a lot like Blow, and Denzel carrys this one off just as well as Depp did. Denzel, Is my third tip for an Oscar nomination, the other two being Russel Crowe for 3:10 to yuma and Viggo Mortensen for Eastern Promises, but I doubt Denzel would win, as his performance is very similar to a lot of his other roles, but still worth the vote. Denzel was class as always in this film, he remains the cool, charming and eye catching performer. There's not much more to say about him really, he's just Denzel, and I don't mean that in a bad way. Russel Crowe is excellent in the supporting role, unlike Denzel, his versatility is what I really like about him, he brings the warmth to the film and person you can relate to. The rest of the class are great, although I hope Buffalo Bill doesn't get many more roles, as you always want him to clear his throat. Some of the shots I really enjoyed, one in particular is just when Denzel is walking down the street with his brothers in New York, I don't know why, but it just sticks in my head. Great film, iconic, already a favorite of mine.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Look out for the piano and try to cut out the middle man.,"This is an excellent movie that once again showcases the talent of one of the greatest American actors today, Denzel Washington. This is a DW tour-de-force, another chapter in the illustrious screen career of this outstanding star. There are no accolades that can adequately describe his presence in this movie. Mr. Washington is part Pacino, part Brando, and ... yes ... even part James Cagney. The only drawback to this movie is casting Russell Crowe as a Jewish police officer. Mr. Crowe does his usual fine job, but his portrayal as a ""Jewish"" officer was a stretch. This movie also teaches certain facts about how to conduct a business, namely if you cut out the middle man you can reduce overhead, regulate the quality of the product and thereby greatly increase profit. That's a pretty good lesson to learn. The problem is of course that the equation leaves out one factor, the law. If you want to know what that means, watch the movie. By the way, this movie also teaches how to use a piano to discipline employees and why certain employees should not wear clothing. Of course, do you really want your employees going about without clothing?Regarding Russell Crowe being cast as a Jewish police officer, this is another egregious example of the kind of blatant miscasting that can destroy the credibility of a movie. Why would any producer want to cast an actor in a role that the actor can in no way believably project? Mr. Crowe is no more believable as a Jewish police officer then would have been, lets say, James Cagney in a similar role. It just doesn't work, so why do it? By the way, when was the last time a Jewish actor played an Irish cop? Get the point?",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Crime and Corruption,"The movie was entertaining, but not riveting. Having read other reviews and accounts of the movie, I went in expecting more than I got. Nevertheless, it was a solid movie and Denzel was, as usual, terrific. Watching him go from an ordinary ""businessman"" to a criminal within a scene, as appropriate to the circumstances, was one of the highlights for me. Had I gone to see the film without the lofty expectations that I had, I would likely have given it at least one more star... I realize that that is unfair to the movie, but hype is part of the game and if a movie fails to meet the hype it has generated, then it is likely to find its rating lower than what you might otherwise have expected for it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Never brand a product unless you wanna be caught,"When I go see a movie there is a certain amount of entertainment that I need to keep me focused on the story...I fell asleep during it... It was a tad boring I do not think that Crowe was type cast properly it could of been Clive Owen he would of been a better match for Washington there was more chemistry between them, in Spike Lees last movie that he made with them, Inside Man. It was not intense enough,and the characters were confusing at first, till the end.Story line was OK however it could of been done in a more dramatic way and should of been produced by Spike Lee because he gets those ghetto pictures done best. He understands the pain of the individual this guy missed it. Yes Danzal played a great role however the rest of the team was lack luster and he was the only one who shined. One note to anyone considering branding their own drugs stupid mistake ( hey Frank are you listening you were screaming to be caught) because there is always a line right to you,if it is illegal.

Here's a Success Story you won't be learning in B-school,"If you were to hear someone tell a story of a man who,from hardscrabble beginnings,was able to rise up,become wealthy and successful beyond perhaps his own dreams and was able to out-produce his competitors so well that he was practically un-reachable,you'd probably think that this person was quite the successful businessman,and you'd be right. Throw in a small matter of that product the man in question sold was Heroin and that his competitors were often snuffed out,that he was basically using the Vietnam war as his own sort of ""in-and-out"" route of business and that he was actually one of the most feared and sought-after mobsters in America over the last thirty or so years,and that,to put it mildly,changes things.And that's how you would classify one Frank Lucas(Denzel Washington,effectively combining his amoral bad-ass from ""Training Day"" with his more charismatic character studies as a hero from films like ""Crimson Tide"" or ""Remember the Titans""),a one-time gopher and right-hand man of legendary Harlem gang-lord Bumpy Johnson. When Bumpy passes in the late 1960s,Lucas moves quickly to consolidate power and uses his own sales methods to make the drug trade more direct,more economical and far more lucrative. IN short order,he's practically out-selling(and dominating)the established crime bosses(read:mostly the MAfia) in NYC,circa 1970 thru 1975.His chief nemesis is one Richie Roberts(Russell Crowe,kinda over-doing the ""New Yawk"" accent here,but still genuinely real),an honest cop of near legendary status. Doggedly chasing Lucas and his syndicate for years(all while working his way through LAw school,no less!),his Vice cops follow his instincts to cover Lucas' terrain,shadowing his work until they can finally piece together just how large his empire stretches.An ambitious project all around,director Ridely Scott succeeds in what seems ordinary and remarkable:namely,making a two-and-half hour story about cops and peddlers in the Big Apple NOT seem pedestrian or ordinary,when the formula's been done countless times before. It doesn't hurt that Steven Zaillian(spelling?)'s script is cribbed from real-life events and is given such a plain,unpretentious presentation that it could pass for(At least in some parts)documentary. Not too many parts here shine out besides Washington and Crowe,but Ruby Dee(as Lucas' trusting mama),Idris Elba(as a less-than-subtle underling of Lucas')and Cuba Gooding Jr.(as one of Lucas' prime business associates and grudging rivals;arguably one of the rare good parts he seems to get these days)do stand out. This film and ""Zodiac"" deserved,in my humble opine, more attention at award time,but maybe it's just as well that this ""flew under the radar"". Good work,it could be argued,is best appreciated when one can find it out on their own,and this is worth the seek.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Good Movie, but.......","I think American Gangster is a really good movie, very entertaining story and great performacnes from Crowe and Washington. But I do have one gripe (I don't know if this was just a weird thing when I saw it, or if it happening in every film reel): the damn boom mic kept on bopping in and out of a lot of scenes. I lost count exactly how many, but it was extremely distracting. I don't understand why a such a big-time Hollywood film could miss something so obvsious like this, it doesn't really make any sense. At least for me, the film was kind of spoiled for me because of a stupid technical problem that they should have seen when they first shot it. Sometimes I could just see a little bit of the mic, but in a couple of scenes the mic might as well been hitting the actors in their faces. It's pretty ridiculous how such a blatant error with a respected director and actors behind it made it to the big screen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Better than ""The Departed""","I watched this movie yesterday and I was pleasantly surprised. Well acted, superbly directed, with a great and convincing story that is also compelling in so many ways. And with something priceless that any movie about organized crime must have if it is to be taken seriously: human characters, with human emotions and unpredictable behaviors, that keep us asking ""what's going to happen next?"" every 3 minutes.For all the morons out there who claim the story is stupid, I just have to say that this movie is based on true events, and sometimes reality is way more stupid than fantasy. Say what?! That to even entertain the idea that the greatest criminals of all times employ simple strategies to succeed is absurd? I don't think so. I think that's what really successful people do, from businessmen to politicians, from manufacturers to scientists, excellency is found among those who are able to notice deficiencies in a particular process and to establish the means to compensate or eliminate those deficiencies. And the more elementary those means are, the greater the level of success attained. And by the way, just because one thing is simple, it doesn't mean that finding that thing is also simple: money is simple, love is simple, happiness is simple... but how many of us have them all?And those who dare to compare Denzel Washington's acting skills with the ones of Leonardo DiCaprio!? Give me a break, Mr. Denzel Washington's performance in ""American Gangster"" shames the vast majority of American and European actors of all time. And no, I am not black, sorry! That's just the way it is. Same goes to Mr. Russel Crowe, I found his performance in ""American Gangster"" better than the one he had in ""Gladiator"".The problem with this movie is that it dares to be intelligent in a genre that has become too much of a laughing stock. People associate gangster to intense shootings, violent extortions, executions, blood baths... and without all those lovely things (that ""American Gangster"" also has, but not exclusively) it just isn't the same thing for all the old gangster's lovers out there.As far as I'm concerned, I'm looking forward to the day when all movies about gangsters are a little bit more like this one, and a little bit less like almost every other gangster movie I've watched before.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
American Gangster,"It was a well crafted, interesting film, with some fine performances, but almost no one went the extra mile. Almost everything in the film works, but hardly anything is great. I thought Josh Brolin basically stole every scene he was in, and Washington also gave a fine performance. Ruby Dee gave a warm, fine performance. She is good, but nothing better than she had to be. I had real problems with Crowes performance, and particularly with the direction of the film. The first hour was amazing, as was the last fifteen minutes of so. The rest was just mediocre. The editing was probably the saving grace is much of the movie. It pieced together the many parts that didn't work, and made them better. Because of the editing, it worked. Because of the editing it was entertaining. It, and Brolins performance were the only great things about the movie.

Although, some of us know the end of Frank Lucas' story, following the events that contributed to the end was entertaining.Although it is a slow and long movie, it does not drag you through the plot and action.

Unique in its way,"American Gangster (2007) is a gripping, meticulously crafted crime drama that stands as one of the standout films of its decade. Directed by Ridley Scott, the film delivers a masterclass in storytelling, blending a complex narrative with outstanding performances from Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. Washington's portrayal of Frank Lucas, a ruthless but intelligent heroin kingpin, is both chilling and compelling, while Crowe shines as Richie Roberts, the determined, morally driven detective trying to bring him down.The film's strength lies in its rich, atmospheric depiction of 1970s New York, where corruption, power, and survival intersect in a world of vice and danger. The screenplay is sharp and authentic, maintaining a steady pace while exploring themes of loyalty, ambition, and morality. Ridley Scott's direction ensures that the tension never lets up, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish.What truly elevates American Gangster is the moral complexity of its characters. Both Lucas and Roberts are deeply flawed yet sympathetic in their own ways, which adds layers to their interactions and the overall plot. The film's powerful cinematography and meticulous attention to detail in recreating the era enhance its immersive quality, making it not only an engaging crime story but also a cultural snapshot of a turbulent time.Ultimately, American Gangster is a triumph of both style and substance, offering a compelling look at ambition, corruption, and the fine line between good and evil. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Cops and Robbers,"Good effort, but Ridley Scott needs to try harder to do better in the genre.It seems wildly over-rated. A lot of the early parts are confusing, in a bad way. The characters are presented in a raw and realistic manner, but not much characterization is given to build up a personality, instead things are strangely rushed in a way that a lot of events happen but the character's motivations aren't delved into. Russell Crowe's Richie is the good cop, he's a womanizer, he's a hard ass, and that's about it.Denzel Washington for all the praise he got didn't seem to put much effort in. He was much more convincing in his role in Man on Fire. Here, he's cold and unblinking in one scene, a jittery rattled old man the next. There's nothing to draw out the conflict inside. For example, the scenes when he buys his mother the new house and watches her face so unemotionally, then remains impassive even as he hugs her. Same later when he hugs his wife. There's just this blank look on him all the time. You don't get a feel for the intensity inside such an individual. Maybe it was weak directing on the part of Ridley Scott.Russell Crowe came across slightly better, maybe on account of having worked with Scott before. But the script doesn't really build on a personality for his character either. Both characters, Frank and Richie, seem paper thin by the end, so the focus pulls away from their actions and is just about the moral of the story.The soundtrack is supposed to be great. But it didn't really stand out, and some of it was borrowed from movies like Jackie Brown.A good one time watch, but gives not inclination for further viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Its 'The Wire' set in the sixties.,"The heavyweights team up for this film and it shows, Ridley Scott directs Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe in the true story of Frank Lucas a big time drugs baron in the late sixties. The story is rooted in truth so doesn't have the theatrics of say 'The Departed' but it is a traditional cops and robbers story played out brilliantly by all involved. Washington is brilliant as the uber cool Lucas ducking and diving his way around the big city with all his brothers fronting what appear to be legitimate business's that actually launder the drugs and money. Crowe (Richie) is the cop determined to take down Frank's organisation and find out where the stuff comes from and which cops pockets are being lined to let Frank become so powerful in the first place. Will Richie the laughing stock of the force behind closed doors, he refuses to take bribes and even returned a million pounds he found in a car, manage to hold on to his integrity and get the job done?. There is a very powerful scene in the middle of the film that flicks between Franks mansion and Richie's flat, Frank carving up an enormous turkey with all the trimmings and Richie making a crisp sandwich, it just goes to illustrate how far apart these two are, being good doesn't bring you wealth and happiness seems to be the message but will Frank get his comeuppance eventually or will the mouse always stay one step ahead of the cat? The whole way the film is shot with a pale wash bleeds the colours out slightly and gives a very authentic feel that works well when it cuts in actual footage of Vietnam, Nixon giving a speech or the recreation of a famous Mohammed Ali fight. But it really is the two main characters that give this film its momentum and without the performances of Washington and Crowe it wouldn't have half the impact it does and it's a story so wild it's hard to believe it actually happened. Gritty, real and engaging American Gangster is up there with any film by Scorsese or Stone and sees Ridley back on top form where he belongs.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
This film leaves an impact,"American Gangster was an interesting film which was never boring even though it was nearly three hours long. THe performances were pretty good as were the surprise acts of violence. I wouldn't consider it a great film, but it is definitely worth seeing if you want to see how drug empires are built.It is the 1970s, and detective Richie Roberts (Crowe) believes that there is a new Kingpin in town dealing heroin. The new Kingpin is Frank Lucas (Washington), and he has built an empire through payoffs and crooked deals. He quickly moves up in the ranks to become one of the most powerful American crime lords which rivals that of the mafia.Roberts, and outcast cop in his own precinct because of his complete honesty and belief in the judicial system, works painstakingly to bring the empire of Frank Lucas down. In his efforts he has to deal with plenty of corruption. One man in particular gives him the biggest trouble, and that would be detective Trupo (Brolin in a fine performance) who makes it as difficult for Roberts as he can.So here we have a battle of wills, and though Roberts and Lucas don't meet until near the end of the movie, each still remains an integral part of the plot. You can't really understand the movie unless you are able to see both men for who they are. It makes the ending even more powerful.Ridley Scott, as usual, shows that he can still direct. The pacing was fantastic and not once did I think the movie dragged. The only small plot that I had a problem with was Richie and his wife's custody battle over their son. It just didn't seem to fit into this movie for some reason, but the rest of the movie is fantastic. I wouldn't say it was the greatest performance for Crowe or Washington, but what they brought to the table was well above average. I highly recommend this movie because it went into details about how corruption can destroy true justice if given the chance. It gives us a side of life that isn't so pleasant and throws it in our faces. A very good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

ridley scott's best film in years?,"Finally got round to seeing this. While it's not Goodfellas (what is after all!) and it's not Scarface, 'American Gangster' is never anything less than thoroughly involving. Denzel chews up the scenery like you haven't seen since 'Training Day' and I would not be at all surprised if he walks off with the Oscar again next year. He conveys the ambition and ruthlessness of Frank Lucas effortlessly but we are never truly repulsed by him since many of those around him are worse (stand up Cuba Gooding Junior and a very scary Josh Brolin).On the one hand he provides his extended family with a way out of extreme poverty, on the other he draws them (Mafia style) into his burgeoning organised crime network. But success does not always bring happiness and Frank is soon racked by self-doubt. Russell Crowe is close to his best (and maybe biggest) as the one good cop in pursuit of Denzel - the final showdown between the two is a highlight. Also look out for Brits Idris Elba and Chiwetel Ejiofor offering solid support.Production design is top notch creating a vivid sense of place and period as you'd expect from the director who gave us the genius of 'Blade Runner' and 'Alien'. Ridley Scott juggles the various story strands with aplomb so that the film has a truly epic feel - while the Frank Lucas stuff is drawn from real events I heard they beefed up the Russell Crowe part. Plus you are left wanting more in that a lot of interesting stuff seems to have happened outside of the story told in the film.An intelligent, adult but nevertheless entertaining mainstream Hollywood film (yes all those words can sometimes fit into the same sentence!) - highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Well done,"Great material for Ridley Scott who loves to recreate universes for blockbusters. Here the drug mafia of Harlem then New York with a Denzel Washington who loves to interpret this kind of psychopath almost sympathetic.The scenario is dense as well as the film. Whether it is about the drug industry, the historical reconstruction or the documentary aspect. Each of the dramatic arcs evolves by small steps and they end up joining: on one side Frank Lucas alias Denzel Washington with his progressive ascension and his domination of the drug market; on the other side Russell Crowe, an honest cop, who tries to understand what is going on and who constitutes the first team of anti-drug policemen, in a police world where corruption seems to be the rule: Russell Crowe arouses the contempt of his police colleagues, because he is honest, and he arouses the curiosity of the mafia, because he is honest.A great success for Ridley Scott, who knows how to choose his scripts and his collaborators, as well as his screenwriters: here Steven Zaillan who is responsible for the script. Scenario that embraces the family life of each of the characters, as well as their professional life and this with the richness of the details of each of the described universes that confers the dimension of documentary to the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Stellar Performances.,"What a flick. This is what you get when the big boys come out to play, and it all comes together in the end.Denzel Washington's performance was superb, one of his finest. The sheer ability to mold and commit to his character shows that he has a firm hold at the upper echelons of the craft. Crowe, on the other hand, chose to be quite understated within his performance, (and it worked for this character!), definitely not the 'Gladiator-type' effort most have come to expect from him. Some might say that Washington's performance somewhat overshadowed that of Crowes, but I'm thinking that was intentional.

Review for American gangster,"*American Gangster* is a gripping, powerful film that redefines the crime genre. From the moment the film begins, it pulls you into the gritty underbelly of 1970s New York City, showcasing the raw and unfiltered world of organized crime.Denzel Washington delivers an unforgettable performance as Frank Lucas, a character who is both charismatic and ruthless. His portrayal captures the complexity of a man driven by ambition and survival, making him both admirable and deeply flawed. Russell Crowe complements him perfectly as the relentless detective Richie Roberts, creating a dynamic that keeps you on the edge of your seat.The direction by Ridley Scott is masterful, expertly weaving together elements of drama, suspense, and moral ambiguity. The cinematography is stunning, painting a vivid picture of the era while immersing viewers in the tension of the story. The soundtrack is equally impressive, enhancing the overall atmosphere and transporting you back in time.What truly stands out in *American Gangster* is its exploration of themes such as power, corruption, and the American dream. The film delves into the consequences of ambition and the ethical dilemmas faced by its characters, prompting viewers to reflect on the choices they make.With its captivating storytelling, stellar performances, and thought-provoking themes, *American Gangster* is a must-watch for any film lover. It's a cinematic tour de force that leaves a lasting impact, cementing its place as one of the greatest crime films of all time. Don't miss this extraordinary journey into the heart of darkness!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Washington's character not as admirable as advertised,"In reading pre-release materials and anticipatory material about the movie, I heard that Lucas was a complicated, complex guy. I can't say I saw that much in the film. To me he seemed like a money-grubbing, cold-blooded, amoral drug dealer. Yes, he looked after his mother and his brothers, but is that really so remarkable? Joe Pesci loves his mother in ""Goodfellas"" but he has no compunction about shooting at the feet of a hobbled waiter or taking out rivals. I don't think there are many out there who do not look after their mothers. The Bible notes that if you love only those dear to you, what more do you do than others? (Matthew 5:47) It would seem that if Lucas was a more complex character, he would exhibit some reservations or depth of character about his role as a high-level drug dealer. That is not the case, however.Washington is fantastic in portraying a determined, capable, but cold-blooded drug dealer, but I do not see any sign that he is concerned with New York City into which he is introducing so much powerful cocaine and heroin. Again, this is not to diminish the movie itself. It is well made although Russell Crowe seems a bit reserved for a hard-nosed Jersey cop and it does seem to drag on a bit. Those criticisms I could jettison completely were Lucas a bit more decent person. However to me there is little to advertise the guy. He imports huge amounts of very powerful, dangerous drugs, coldly kills those who cross him, and, to my mind, does little else that is admirable.The film itself drags on a bit courtesy of a rather dry later-middle part of the movie which tracks the difficulty that Richie Roberts (Crowe) comes across in attempting to tie Lucas to the proliferation of high grade drugs on the streets of New York. Lucas' determination to make a mint comes from his belief that the man with whom he cut his teeth as a younger man Charlie Williams (Joe Morton) gave up too much of his money to middle-men in getting his drugs. It's because of this belief that his mentor gave up too much that Lucas attempts and succeeds greatly in cutting out the middlemen. Lucas is essentially the most cut-throat of American businessman-a greedy man who dislikes conceding any amount of possible profits to those whom he considers to be trespassing on his territory. It is this cold-blooded calculation which makes him a compelling character. That said, I do not find him even close to complicated. Cold-blooded, ruthless competitiveness in the drug trade does not really seem to me justification for making such a technically proficient, nicely scored, and well- acted (particularly Ted Levine, Josh Brolin, Cuba Gooding as an athlete with a small share of the drug market which has personally addicted him, and Ruby Dee as a not ignorant mother who accepts her son's largesse but is not in the dark. Washington, however, takes the acting cake, depicting a clear-eyed, enterprising businessman who happens to sell drugs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Phenomenal,"This movie had everything one could ask for to make it a film that is nearly flawless. The story was great, since the film is in fact based on a true story it makes the overall film that much more interesting and unique. Although it was a tad on the long side, there is enough interesting material to keep the viewers watching.What makes the film so well done is the fact that it is not a copy of anything anybody has already seen before. Although it may seem like it at first, the viewers can take comfort in that fact that they won't have any feelings of Daja Vu. Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe's characters were both very in depth characters, which is good because the viewer may also take comfort in the fact that they will most likely leave the theatre feeling very satisfied without any unanswered questions, thanks to the fact that both the story and the characters were explained very thoroughly. The acting was outstanding, thanks to Russel Crowe and Dezel Washington. The fact that their overall acting performance was phenomenal it may change your whole opinion on the movie for the better.I have never really been a big fan of movies that are longer then they need to be, but that's just me. However like I said before, there is enough material in here that keeps the movie going, and there's enough that the viewers won't feel that the movie is to repetitive or overdone. This movie is just right for anyone weather it be a fan of action, drama, crime, suspense, or anything of that nature.Although typically this movie isn't meant to be an action movie, there is plenty of action, which is a good thing because the movie does an excellent job of pulling the action off in a way that is for the better rather then for the worse. Overall, this is a movie that is done right in all areas. Any fan of action, crime, etc, will definitely find this movie worth while and could watch it without having a single regret.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A morality tale epic battle of wits between two titans,"One of the oldest film genres, the gangster film used to be populated with small, minute-scaled personal stories of redemption or personal achievement. But in the 1970's this genre quickly evolved, in particular with the help of directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese and Brian De Palma, into a genre identified with broad, sprawling epic depictions of loyalty, family, and rise-and-fall tales: the gangster epic. Directly continuing this grand cinematic tradition, Ridley Scott delivers a fantastic work or extensive, grand proportions in all the possible aspects of film-making technique, cinematographic craft, and historical precision.Steven Zaillian, the man who penned Schindler's List and Gangs of New York, delivers a broad, sprawling and wonderful screenplay more than fitting of the word ""epic"". Zaillian provides us with a cornucopia of details concerning everything from Frank Lucas' rise to power, his work methods and his relations both with his family and with other gangsters; and on the other end of the spectrum, Richie Roberts' work ethics, relations with co-workers, eventual assignment to take down the drug kingpins, and all this coupled with his own personal problems and family life. We see the rise, the stay at the top, the fall, the aftermath, and everything in-between, and are spared no historical or fascinating detail whatsoever. That said, the script does have one major weakness: I feel Zaillian could have summarized the aftermath a little more than it ended up taking. But while the script certainly is meant to serve as a giant, broad magnifying glass to this particular period in American crime history  and certainly more than delivers on this historical plane  it's very hard to miss what Zaillian was truly aiming at here, and that is the facing off of two titanic forces of nature.What is most fascinating about how Zaillian chooses to portray his two main subjects is not only how negated they are, but also the nature of these negatives. Frank Lucas, the drug kingpin who kills at will and who is single-handedly responsible for the cheap distribution of illegal and highly deadly drugs on the streets, is shown as a charming, relentless family man whose first and foremost order of business is providing his mother and brothers with a large estate to make sure they are set for life; he arranges meetings for his talented nephew with heads of baseball teams, he is faithful to his wife, he goes to church every Sunday with his mother, and he generally works his hardest at constantly keeping his cool. Detective Richie Roberts, on the other hand, is an undeniable good soul; a recurrently mentioned point in his career is that he found $1 million in untraceable dollars in the trunk of a car and turned it in. He is the laughing stock of the entire police force for being straight as an arrow and entirely honest, and his devotion in the taking down of first Lucas and eventually the crooked NYC police force is truly inspirational. But Richie is divorced, he skips out on the sparse meetings he has with his kid, he is a womanizer and we know that he cheated on his wife and engages in casual sex; he is a lonely recluse who takes night courses and always seems to be preoccupied with something else. Judging by their characters, you'd think that Lucas would be the one to root for, and indeed this negation, this battle of the wits, is the centerpiece of the epic drama.And who better to play two opposing titan forces than two of the undeniably most titanic actors of our generation, Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington. Crowe's performance is pitch-perfect and he effortlessly embodies Richie's every trait, from his indecisiveness and preoccupied nature to his blind devotion and honesty to his flawless accent. And yet, he is indisputably overshadowed by Denzel Washington's powerhouse performance as the charming, murderous family-man drug kingpin Lucas, who he plays with an almost animal ferocity that comes so incredibly naturally to him. The supporting cast also features some familiar faces that deserve a little more time in the spotlight than they currently have, namely Chiwetel Ejiofor, who plays Lucas' brother who gets a little too caught up in the luxurious life Lucas provides him and who continues to deliver fantastic roles in the movies he acts in, both as a supporting and as a lead player; and Josh Brolin, who plays the corrupt cop with such dirty sleaze-bagginess that he can truly be viewed as the film's one true villain and who must have been in more high-profile movies in 2007 alone more than he has been in during the rest of his entire career beforehand.I have noticed that many movies in 2007 are morality tales: the good guys have their many flaws and weaknesses emphasized while the bad guys are portrayed as likable, admirable persons despite their actions. Ridley Scott, undeniably one of our greatest working directors, delivers a fantastic entry into the crime epic genre that works both as a stunning and brilliant cinematic achievement, as a historic depiction of crime history, as a rise-and-fall story, and as a morality tale epic battle of wits between two titans. One is only left to regret the fact that Ridley Scott didn't shoot this epic in all of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio glory his films are usually identified with.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"""See, ya are what ya are in this world. That's either one of two things: Either you're somebody, or you ain't nobody.""","American Gangster (2007) is about the true story of Frank Lucas' (Denzel Washington) rapid rise to success in the drug business, followed by his eventual fall thanks to Detective Richie Roberts' (Russell Crowe) endless efforts to get to the bottom of the growing drug epidemic within New York City.Crowe and Washington were utterly brilliant in this picture (but then again, is that even surprising?), their faultless acting made me feel very immersed throughout.Ridley Scott's direction in this movie is very good too, even if I did think at one point, ""man, imagine if Scorsese directed this instead"".However, there are some inaccuracies when comparing fact to fiction. The biggest issue being the fact that Richie Roberts gets all the credit here. In reality, even Roberts himself agrees that it was a team endeavour and one that was not spearheaded by him, unlike how this film paints the picture. But either way, the reason why I'm giving this a 9 and not a 10 is because it simply didn't feel like a 10/10 movie.But ultimately this is still a fantastic feature, and I would 100% recommend it to anyone who thinks this might be of their taste. Or even if you're just a fan of Washington or Crowe, you will certainly be captivated by either one's performance. And if you're worried about the long runtime, the movie doesn't drag at all, at least not for me it didn't.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

plot a little thin,"Enjoyed this movie very much. Superb acting by Russell Crowe who creates and then IS Richie Roberts in all his complexity. Not the same for Denzel who swings between suave and Psycho and lacks the nuances that would have made this character more interesting. The story is one of historical character development.The ultimate fall of Lucas hinges on one minor plot development. Hence, the movie as a whole is not the ripping yarn of The Godfather or The Departed. Still very enjoyable.But why all the noms for Denzel? Politics have gone crazy in H-Wood!Ridley Scott has done well but at 152min, Ifeel the whole thing is a little long. Support cast are generally excellent. It's good.

Inferior pastiche of Martin Scorcese,"American Gangster is Ridley Scott's attempt at imitating Martin Scorcese, and he doesn't attain the same heights. Starring Denzel Washington as Frank Lucas, the drug-dealing kingpin has an air of tranquil fury punctuated by increasing outbursts of impulsive violence, underpinned by a convincing suave that endears him with the community. However, despite masterful acting and a lively period atmosphere, the plot is mostly by-the-numbers and plays out the same tired rise-and-fall tropes with his disillusioned family leaving by the end. One saving grace is the character played by Russell Crowe, whose boy scout like enthusiasm seems to jar with the amount of prosecutions he can carry out, but at least constitutes a fresh breath to the genre. Overall, despite some bright spots, American Gangster is a repetitive and meandering that doesn't live up to its potential.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Disturbing,"This was a well made movie and entertaining for adults however, I guess the movie industry will be determine not to let Tyler Perry and Bernic Mac get away with showing blacks as decent people. America thinks our morals have gone to hell. It makes it hard on black single mothers and all blacks who commute 3 hrs each day, each way because the jobs are moving out of our neighborhoods leaving latch key kids behind. Good jobs are drying up for blacks in an already tight economy. People are tired of us. America's children as we are called. Gangs are walking black neighborhoods not just the ghetto. Most black kids are being raised by single mothers (everyone knows this) and to be victimized by our males like this is scary to us. Just think what everyone else thinks. I hope some of the money they made from this film goes toward programs to help grandparents who are raising their grandkids off of social security checks because the kids parents are on drugs. In the black community this is alarming. Spike Lee was one of those kids. He is not a gangster. He is very creative. Make a movie about his grandmother. Make a movie about LL Cool J grandparents. What about single parents who raised responsible creditable business people and their struggle? Show balance. Every race has gangsters but blacks cannot afford to glorify them at this time. I know movies like these will always be made no matter what. Please slow it down. We as a community need you to be social responsible and give to programs that those you are glorifying have hurt. You are glorifying gangs (intentionally or not) that walk our neighborhoods and not yours. The movie actors and producers live with guards at their gates. Single mothers come home and lock 5 locks on the doors and afraid to come out at night. I am a little disappointed in Denzel. I know that kind of money is hard to turn down and if he did not take the part someone else would have. I just wish he had let it been someone else. Maybe it would not have been such a blockbuster. I know I was one of those people that have seen every movie Denzel played in because Denzel starred in it. Even my kids tells me. Denzel has a new movie out mom. I know you are going to see it. Even the bootleggers yell from parking lots to women. We got Denzel new movie. They don't announce the title. Not putting you down brother just please don't do another one.

A True American Gangster,"I don't know much about the director of this film, Ridley Scott, but I do know that Denzel Washington doesn't make a bad movie and apparently neither does Scott. I must admit though, when i was sitting in the theater i was a little surprised. Never hearing about Frank Lucas before, i thought this movie was about life on the streets, and crime in NY (you know ""gangster"" things). I wasn't expecting to find that Denzel was a kingpin. I HATE drug movies but this one was good. The emotion was raw and enrapturing, the acting was so good i didn't consider it acting, and the action was intense. the nudity and drug use was too much for me to handle, but other than that this definitely goes with Washington's other classics such as Man on Fire and John Q.

I would watch The Godfather or Goodfellas again before I watch this film a second time.Yes, Denzel was good, but he really didn't have a lot to work with as far as a story. The real story was Richie's efforts to bring down the corrupt cops. That's been done so many times, that you just think of New York cops as corrupt.A best supporting actress award nomination for Ruby Dee? Give me a break. She had one scene of note.

One of the best crime films I've seen,"Ridley Scott's biopic/mob film ""American Gangster"" is one of my favorite organized crime movies. The script, direction, cinematography, and acting (particularly from Washington) are all impressive. As a fan of mafia and crime movies, the plot and story make for a great popcorn flick. However, this film does have its downsides. Crowe's storyline sometimes feels like a rip-off of ""Serpico"". The Richie Roberts' plot line is less interesting than Frank Lucas', and Roberts' family problems hurt the pacing and seem uninspired and unoriginal. Washington's great performance and the fascinating story more than a make up for these slight defects though. There are two versions of the film, the R-rated theatrical and the unrated director's cut. The DVD contains both versions, and the unrated version adds time and plot, not more objectionable material. I slightly preferred the theatrical version, but thought the unrated versions ending was marginally better.I give American Gangster a strong 8/10. If you liked it, I recommend Serpico, The Godfather, Scarface, the Departed, Goodfellas, Casino, Eastern promises, and A History of Violence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

The script is solid, the characters very well-played out and the direction by Ridley Scott is excellent.Washington's portrayal of Lucas was excellent. His character flipping between loving family man, then violent drug importer was handled very well, and made me emotionally concerned for the other characters, not knowing when he might suddenly fly off the wall. It was a strong, believable portrayal. Crowe's characterisation of Roberts was also excellent - but my attention was drawn more toward Washington.Small part appearances by Cuba Goding Jr (Boyz In The Hood, Jerry Macguire) and Carla Gugino (Sin City, Entourage) were also excellent choices, playing their roles as Nicky Barnes and Laurie Roberts respectively, very well.I was also impressed with the cinematography by Harris Savides. While nothing extra-ordinary stood out, this was actually why I was impressed. The storyline of American Gangster does not need anything special, or overdone - and this was achieved. Being such a large film, I'm sure the temptation would have been there to experiment, but Savides didn't - resulting in a fantastic cinematic result.Co-Written by Steve Zaillian, he was the perfect writer for the job, having had already been proved with realistic, historical and 'intense' films such as Clear and Present Danger and Schindler's List, the dialogue, characters and historical scene settings are fantastic.If detailed story lines and long, sometimes a little slow, films are not your thing, then you probably won't be a big fan of American Gangster.

Gangster Good Not Great,"Ridley Scott never fails when it comes to the action genre. Furthermore, how can you go wrong when you pair two of the best actors of our time, Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, on the same screen. The violence in this film is what makes it captivating and memorable. In many ways its reminiscent of Goodfellas in that regard. However, unlike that film it does not score the unquestionable home run the cast and pre-release hype inarguably suggested it would. This is a film definitely worth seeing on the big screen. A valuable piece of cinema, but not one that blew me away in the manner I had hoped for. I had similar feelings for The Departed and we see how successful that film was, so this may be a better review than I had actually intended.

Gangster Classic,"Coolly and professionally created 'American Gangster' is a film of much quality which surpasses the more commercial, and Academy award winning 'The Departed'.'American Gangster' has a taut script that enables the audience to understand the characters that both Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe play. Much like Goodfellas, it is slick and informative and does not flinch at showing the devastating effects of the drug trade.Crowe, Washington and Brolin all perform well but special mention should go to Chiwetel Ejiofor who really absorbs the screen.

Overrated but Anchored by an Astonishing Performance by Denzel Washington,"Frank Lucas: See, ya are what ya are in this world. That's either one of two things: Either you're somebody, or you ain't nobody.Expectations were high for multi-talented filmmaker Ridley Scott's latest feature film exploring the life of powerful African-American drug trafficker Frank Lucas (Academy Award Winner Denzel Washington) and his eventual capture by a down-on-his-luck Jewish cop Richie Roberts (Academy Award Winner Russell Crowe). I expected it to be a Best Picture contender for sure, but after having viewed it I realized I was sorely mistaken. I guess disappointed is the correct term I'd use for my feelings after having seen 'American Gangster'. Don't get me wrong, 'American Gangster' is a very good film, it's just not a great one. I guess the film's problem lies in how unoriginal it is. 'Gangster' just doesn't seem like an honest and genuine movie, it seems to borrow from a lot of other similar films and relies a lot upon gimmicks and catchy snippets of dialogue to con the audience into thinking it's the next Godfather. 'American Gangster' is anything but the next Godfather. It's very good, with some extraordinary performances, beautifully filmed sequences and some significantly powerful scenes, but it's nothing we haven't already seen before time and time again.Denzel Washington steals the film with a charming yet terrifying portrayal of a man pushed to the edge. Russell Crowe is solid but underused as Richie Roberts. 'Gangster' also sports some outstanding supporting performances. Josh Brolin is brilliantly creepy as a crooked cop, the marvelous Chitwel Ejofor is excellent in a against-type role for him as Washington's f__ck-up brother, and flamboyant Broadway actor Roger Bart (The Producers, Hostel Part II) is very much out of his element as an angry, foul-mouthed and racist FBI agent.Ridley Scott's direction is spot-on as always, especially during an astonishingly well-shot sequence where Washington and his goons get arrested. The screenplay is another story. While taut, engrossing but kind of contrived for the most part, the ending is perhaps the sappiest I've seen from ANY movie all year. God! It made me want to puke crap! I apologize for being so graphic and raunchy, but I felt that was the best way to describe how the film's conclusion made me feel.Despite it's flaws, when all is said and done, 'American Gangster' is a long but fast-paced, contrived yet entertaining, well-acted, well-directed and adequately written crime/drama that is well worth your time.

American Gangster,"American Gangster is based on the true story of Frank Lucas, who became rich and powerful after he started smuggling heroin into the country from Vietnam on planes returning from the Vietnam war. A detective named Richie Roberts, starts to investigate Frank and soon starts to gather enough evidence to eventually bring him and his drug empire down. American Gangster is an impressive film for many reasons. For starters the film has a very intelligent and well written script that is perfectly carried out by the acting cast as well as the film's director. The attention to detail and capturing the mood, music and just the era of the late 60's and early 70's was also well done I thought. The film is longer in length, but I found it to be a truly engrossing and captivating picture that I did not once find it boring or slow at all. I found the pacing to be just right to have enough of a character study going on, but also enough to keep us interested and entertained. The editing and stylish behind the scenes camera work by director Ridley Scott, I also appreciated as well as the very powerful and believable performances by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe who play the two main leads. There have been a lot of different gangster films over the years and while this one could have been unoriginal and nothing new compared to a film like Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas, I felt that there was enough here to make this it's own movie without having to borrow ideas or formulas from other films that are similar in story and genre. This was a fairly original and captivating story which probably is helped by the fact that it is a true story and an interesting one at that. To capture the mood and era of when this all happened I give a big thanks to the film's screenwriter as well as Ridley Scott once again. Like I said earlier I was engrossed and captivated by this film and it never once stopped interesting and entertaining me. The film is more than a piece of entertainment helped by a great cast and crew who all do their best work here which is actually award worthy stuff and I wouldn't be surprised if this film did eventually get nominated for something in the next couple of months. This was an original and well done film that was engrossing and had a terrific pace to it helped by a great cast and crew that make this an award worthy film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
And he's done it again!,"When someone knows how to do something, they can do no wrong, and Ridley Scott knows his drill very well, by heart actually. He could do the same thing and fail, but he has the miraculous gift of making really good movies like ""American Gangster"", which make you pay attention, think and even provide entertainment.The film shows the rise of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) in the drug-dealing market during the early 70's. He was black and of low profile and making more money than anyone; imagine how the Italian families and the rest of the mob felt. Denzel plays Lucas as a patient listener who listens every advice carefully and always worries about protecting his back, but also is fearless when it comes to take responsibility.It's a beautiful contrast to watch him giving wise advices one minute and killing someone in the middle of the street the other, and it's even greater to see how his work rises to another level when he works with true authors like Ridley Scott, not his brother Tony. He had fun in Tony's ""Man on Fire"" but he had a blast and delivered better in Spike Lee's ""Inside Man"".Going back to Ridley. It takes a mastermind to do all the tricks in almost three hours. He gives the camera no specific role: Harris Savices' camera sometimes stands watching from a hiding place, other times it's a permanent part of the action; the rest of the time it dedicates to create compositions like a plane passing through the middle of two street signsThat's as close as I come to explaining something that is only wonderful when you see it.Like seeing Russel Crowe perform; knowing he's played a role so similar in ""L.A. Confidential"" and that he's the only one able to compose something so different. Knowing that whether with Ron Howard in ""A beautiful mind"" or with Ridley here, Brian Grazer can always get something spectacular out of the Australian.And together with Scott he also gets a lot out of the entire ensemble (without counting a truly underused Cuba Gooding Jr): Carla Gugino in a formidably unexpected role, a scary portrayal by Josh Brolin, a joyful turn by Armand Assante, a living proof that if you forget about Chiwetel Ejiofor's performances is because he always seems one more human being, and a scene of incomparable emotion in the hands of a flawless Ruby DeeFeel that one.High point? Steven Zaillian's script. Low point? Marc Streitenfeld's score, not the soundtrack. The secret of risk? Having Denzel and Crowe in the same movie not putting them on screen together until the very end and not delivering something breathtaking in that moment. That's a great director. The secret of excellent film-making? I'll tell you in some kind of comparison but I won't give names because it's pointless.In an everyday picture of this type, the bad guy would be a monster and the good guy a heroic martyr. You would only remember their names and know nothing or not care about their families and friend; if the movie provides the characters. There would be a small valid reason for the good guy to start killing; you wouldn't question it and there would be a shooting scene every five minutes, with cars flying through the air and all that.In ""American Gangster"", besides the three dimensions of the characters' family and friends, there's only one shooting scene; and when it comes not only a character wants it but we do also. Because we know the character and we know how important it is for him. Read carefully: we weren't asking for a shooting scene; we would have been fine without it but we accept it because a character needs it. Oh, and we enjoy it of course. That's Ridley Scott.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Scott shines again... along with two of the best actors of our time.,"Ridley Scott loves his villains. He has always attempted to show the characters with questionable morality in a new light. His characters are never black or white... they just roam in different shades of grey.Frank Lucas, the character on the other side of law, a drug lord in 70s New Jersey, is Scott's principal character in this film. But Scott would never paint him out-and-out dark with villainy. He needs someone who would play it just according to the right shade of grey. And here we got Denzel Washington. In the scene where Frank shows his newly-bought mansion to his mother and says - ""Momma this is your house"" ... and in the scene where he puts a bullet through someone's head in the middle of a crowded street - Washington is equally convincing, a delightful screen presence.These stories particularly need a 'good cop'. High morals, troubled personal life, on the verge of career end, standing alone among his corrupted colleagues - you know the stereotype. This is Ritchie Roberts played by none other than Russell Crowe. Crowe is proved champion in playing such diligent, meticulous characters. Here his accent, attention and mannerisms are perfect. Josh Brolin is again awesome in his supporting role.Based on a true story, the screenplay does a good job in curbing the need of first-person narrations in such a story. It is surprisingly low-key, but is able to deliver the required amount of tension and style. The action sequences are extremely well-balanced, ruthless but never seemed tiring. ""American Gangster"" is definitely one of the best movies of 2007... but it falls short of absolute greatness, for a reason somehow unknown.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Excellent crime saga,"Ridley Scott's best film since Gladiator tells the true-life tale of Frank Lucas, a delegate of the Harlem crime scene who rises to become the biggest importer of the heroine drug in American history. Played brilliantly by Denzel Washington, Lucas is an ambiguous character, one who justifies his heinous business through everlasting love and devotion to his huge family, notably his mother. The film also explores the story of the cop who rigorously fought to bring him down - Ritchie Roberts, an equally impressive performance from Rusell Crowe. Eschewing his typical manly marauding screen presence, Crowe's Roberts is shlubby, awkward and difficult with his corrupt co-workers. The film is both reminiscent and directly referential of the great 70s cop thrillers that inspired it, such as The French Connection and Serpico. Although it never aspires to be on the same level as those films, it does make for a ripping and insightful crime saga.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Crowe and Washingtion Back Again!,"Their first outing was not as good, so this time they had to come with the fiya! And the FIYA they came with! I enjoyed this film a lot, because it was 2 1/2 Hours long and it felt like 60 minutes. Of course, Russell and Denzel make the movie very believable. The action came at the right time and it didn't feel pushed. I thought the story was cool, and the rest of the cast did what they had to do. Russell, Denzel, and Scott you really can't go wrong! To any of those that decided to say that they didn't put on a academy award type show for you, my question is why do they have to? The movie didn't call for a lot of crying, or anything else.

But if you're a fan of either of these two stars (and the well-appointed cast they're fronting) or you just like New York in the '70s, it's worth your time.For me, I've seen this twice - once in the theater and again today - and that's probably enough.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"""Gangster"" hands out the good stuff","""Anerican Gangster"", the new Ridley Scott film about 70's drug titan Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) and the rogue cop Richie Roberts(Russell Crowe) who tried to put him behind bars, is a strange phenomena. It is, in different respects, one of the years greatest sucesses and most devastating disappointments. Let's start with the triumphs-the actors are dynamite. Viewers who want to see great thespians do their thing are in for a big treat here. Denzel is a fiery wonder as Lucas, and Crowe deserves a lot more appreciation than he's getting for his quieter, more tortured performance as a cop who has nothing left but the job. Even the supporting cast, be they infamous flop-makers like Cuba Gooding, Jr, or renowned character actors such as Armand Assante, turn in superb, note perfect performances. And Ruby Dee steals the movie as Lucas's elderly, principled mother. Behind the scenes, no expense is spared. The New York streets look delicilously ratty, the period music is catchy, and the cinematography brings a great clarity to the ups and downs of gangster life. The biggest disappointment is in the script. Steve Zaillian has written an epic, almost 3-hour script, but it comes down to a lot of ""and then this happens..oh, and next..."". Almost no character insight is given, no significant action driven by anything other than the desire to make money. And the build-up is agonizingly slow. ""Gangster"" has some classic scenes, but none of them can be attribute to the script, nor to Scott's clunky direction (I won't start on my personal opinions of this director). Still, definitely worth a look-when Crowe and Washington clash, you get the best-acted moment in movies since ""Heat""'s coffeeshop scene.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Very Well Done,"American Gangster is a very well done gangster/cop movie. Denzel Washington plays Frank Lucas who rises up to be a dominant gangster in the Brooklyn/New York area. He has his brothers work for him and makes his money off of selling pure drugs.Russell Crowe plays an honest cop who heads up an anti narcotics division led by his boss (Ted Levine, Silence of the Lambs). Crowe, along with members of the crew, are tracking down the big men of the drug world, and soon find themselves on Frank Lucas's tail.The acting is top notch. Denzel Washington makes a very nasty, but yet likable gangster and Crowe makes a a good, honest cop with a bad home life. Also notable is Josh Brolin. He doesn't come in much until about an hour after the film has been rolling, but he makes a very believable dirty cop out to make money by selling drugs that he confiscates back to gangsters after cutting them down to hardly any purity.The movie is long, complex and sometimes hard to follow, yet it is worth a watch, or two, or more. Its acting is perfect and its very interesting. Note that it is not an action movie. There is some action, but if that's what you want, watch something else. This film is a drama.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Wow!,"Spectacular, absolutely spectacular. There are not many films out there about which I can say this. However this one deserves nothing less. Everything is perfect. I don't think there could have been more suitable actors for the roles. Denzel is brutal and greedy, and at the same time elegant. Out of all the black actors out there, he is the only one who could play such a role flawlessly. Crowe played the good guy, the tough, honest cop who put his job above everything else, who did what he believed what right despite all the corruption around him. Characters like him have been in hundreds of movies before it, nevertheless his character is very distinct and original.There are very few crime movies out there with an atmosphere so dark, yet so realistic. I was born in the eighties, but this movie gave me a feeling like I was reliving the sixties. It is absolutely brilliant. One movie that I can say goes along with this one is Blow. Blow is the story about how cocaine spread, and American Gangster is the story about heroin. However the movies do have many similarities, the differences are just as copious. To name one, there are many fun, happy moments in blow, and in this movie there are none. Although this is one of the movie's greatest strengths, the serious portrayal of greed, corruption, lust for power and justice.I strongly advise everyone (who's an adult) to see this movie, either rent it, buy it, steal it, I don't care how, JUST GET IT!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"""American Gangster""","In ""Amican Gangster"" we have an action/crime/drama movie which is a biographical depiction of the life of a guy named Frank Lucas(played by Denzel Washington). We follow Lucas (who existed in real life) as he becomes some kind of heroin kingpin in a matter of years after going overseas to South East Asia and sending some of those drugs back in to the United States. As a result of his journey & what he came back to the U.S.A. with, the streets of America became more downtrodden & full of crime & violence than ever before.Now as far as the movie is concerned, there is next to nothing in the way of character development for the main character in the movie, in other words, there is hardly anything that describes anything about who Frank Lucas was before the time of the beginning of the movie. This leaves the movie feeling incomplete from the very beginning. There are quit a few big named actors (Such a as Russel Crowe & Cuba Gooding Jr.) and a ""who's who"" of the music industry list as supporting actors and extras (RZA, Common, T.I., Anthony Hamilton). Anyway, the plethora of high profile actors & music stars did not make the movie any better. Perhaps it made the move way more hyped up and anticipated in order to ensure box office success. Anyhow, the glamorization of drug dealing and the glamorization of the insensitivity that it takes to sell heroin to thousands of people knowing the disastrous effects that it has on their lives, is what this movie is basically all about. Why would any big time director hire an all star cast to do this? I don't know. Maybe the director got a kick out of doing that. Other than that, we get to see the average police vs. bad guy scenes and of course, the crooked cops are prevalent in here too. Besides that, Denzel Washington DOES NOT seem to be casted well for this role. Even though this movie may be based on a true story, something seems to be way off in seeing an ""African American"" heroin dealer in the 60's walking around the streets and moving through different social circles & gatherings while talking like he's a freedom fighter who's being responsible by showing his people how to make a better life by selling drugs at the expense of the rest of society.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

And fortunately, Cuba Gooding Jr. probably will put a new direction in his career, because his last films were absolutely awful. The recreation of the 70's is perfect in all the things.

There are two sides to the American dream,"Following the death of his employer and mentor, Bumpy Johnson, Frank Lucas establishes himself as the number one importer of heroin in the Harlem district of Manhattan. Meanwhile, a dedicated and honest policeman, Richie Roberts, heads up a joint narcotics task force with the Federal government.I'm biased towards gangster films. No, not films like ""Lucky # Slevin"" and ""Running Scared."" Those two films are unlike any gangster films I've ever seen. I'm biased towards films like ""Scarface,"" ""The Departed,"" ""Carlito's Way,"" etc. The real gangster films. Why? I just don't like to watch such things like that.I was and wasn't looking forward to this. Like many successful gangster films, this peaked my interest, yet I'm still against these types of films. Like ""The Departed,"" there wasn't really anything special and brilliant about this film. However, I will say it tries to be different than just naming people ""Johnny"" and ""Carlito"" or ""Pablo.""Like ""The Departed,"" the true and best part of this film is during the third act, where everything builds up and eventually lead to a satisfying confrontation and/or ending. The first and second acts aren't too interesting to me. Sure, there are probably about seven scenes that would interest me but overall, nothing special.The performances by ""Denzel Washington"" and ""Russel Crowe"" are as good as always; no questions about it, however, I did not really connect with Crowe's accent.

Shoddy Film Making at its Best,"Besides the fact that the film is choppy and the story has more holes then a piece of swiss cheese....Id Like to point out some minor editing and production points the took me out of the film completely.First of all,everyone knows that New Yorkers love movies about New York and the many characters that have graced its streets.But when you do a scenes location and then try to pass it off as elsewhere it really bothers me.All the shots under the bridge that are supposedly New Jersey...hey,thats actually Brooklyn...what bridge are you supposed to be standing under...the GW?because its actually the Willismburg Bridge being pawned off as New Jersey.Secondly,the fact that there is Graffiti everywhere...hey,its 1968....people weren't tagging the streets yet....especially in NJ.Thirdly,when I see the first shot of the RZA....why is it a shot of his Wu Tang tattoo.Im sorry and maybe Im being too picky but these small elements really pull me out of a film.To spend millions upon millions of dollars on a film and not fix these minor details seems absurd to me.The film is too long and the performances are mediocre at best.Id like Denzel Washington to take a role where he doesn't play Denzel Washington.Josh Brolin and Ruby Dee make the film enjoyable for some smaller moments but besides that the film is filled with too many scenes glitz and glamour instead of the character development it lacked.By the end of the film I didn't care what happened to any of the characters which for me means you failed.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Familiar but well told story,"Gangster movies usually bore me witless (""The Godfather"" and ""The Sopranos"" apart), but Ridley Scott is an interesting director and the story here is derived from real events. The style of the film is busy  there is often far more going on the tightly edited scenes than the viewer can take in at once - but as it progresses things fall into place and the two parallel stories of Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas and incorruptible New Jersey detective Richie Roberts eventually merge. As Lucas, Denzil Washington puts in his usual solid performance, and Russell Crowe, with a rather less interesting character- the only thing unusual about him is that he is an honest copper- fits the role perfectly. What is more, he speaks every line audibly, an object lesson to some of today's fashionable actors who all seem to think they are Brando. The gang members here, though, just about need sub-titles, and there are so many it is difficult to keep track of who's who.Much of the story  set in the period 1968 to 1974  is familiar to those of us around at the time  US army personnel smuggling pure heroin from SE Asia back to the US of A in coffins, police corrupted by the vast amounts of money involved, the rise of black crime bosses. The movie doesn't dig too far into motivation  greed is accepted as sufficient. Frank Lucas's gang operates as a family business, with five brothers and numerous cousins in the organization but he keeps almost all the money for himself, resenting paying even $10,000 a month to bent coppers while amassing $250 million in offshore bank accounts. His boldest ploy was to cut out the middleman and buy pure heroin direct from a surprisingly urbane ex-Kuomintang general hiding in a remote South-East Asian jungle (probably Burma). His customers got Frank's ""Double Blue"" heroin at twice the strength for half the price. This of course killed more people, but Frank never seems to be short of customers.Without giving the game away it can be said that Richie is fairly successful in his efforts against the heroin trade, but others, some selling other drugs, sprang up to take Frank's place. Ridley Scott doesn't go into the issue, but this story clearly shows the futility of treating drug abuse as a criminal law rather than a public health problem. Unfortunately the puritanical origins of the United States are still reflected in public attitudes towards addiction. The addict is a sinner and must suffer to be redeemed. Punishment is more important than rehabilitation, and drug dealers are beyond the pale altogether (actually I would go along with the last bit as long as it included tobacco company executives). Anyway, as I said, Ridley Scott stays clear of the issue. He gives us a familiar story, cleverly framed and well presented.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Good, but not as good as many people say","This movie is solid work (as we could expect from maestro Scott) but nothing more. It definitely lacks something.

It is not comparable, unfortunately, it is not in the same league even. I can see these movies over and over, because there are pure magic in them. I doubt if i will see American Gangster more than one more time. I saw it once, i appreciate it, i don't miss it. It is too long, which is not the problem in itself. I know its fashionable to make long ""epics"" about 3 hours long and more but its not always good for the movie when there is not enough interesting plot, drama, tension, fascinating relations between characters. This is the case - long parts of the American Gangster are just boring because there was not enough substance to fill the ""empty spaces"".

Luckily, this is one of the hits. This is a film that would not look out of place alongside the celebrated gangster films of Coppola and Scorsese.Indeed, this film bears a recognizable resemblance to ""The Godfather"" films and ""GoodFellas"", in much the same way that ""Gladiator"" was a riff on ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Spartacus"".

The Godfather in Harlem - Brilliant Film if Occasionally Hard to Follow,"Denzel Washington does not play simpletons. His characters are complex mosaics layered with deep passions, personal convictions, and polarizing contradictions. Sometimes moral, occasionally hypocritical, these characters mesmerize you to the point where the cloak you see is the character and not the actor, which is of course the point. If there is anything that could be said of Washington's roles, they deal with the human condition at a raw naked level. As Frank Lucas, Washington steps into the shoes of an African-American Godfather and shows he can play almost anything brought before him. He probably deserves the Oscar for every one of his performances. Problem is, they can only give one a year.Frank Lucas is the most unlikely of crime bosses, or so went the stereotype of the mid-20th century that propagated that only Italians and/or Irish could mastermind such complex money-making schemes. And Lucas is also discounted because he was the chauffeur of an Italian godfather for years. How could the hired help even dream, let alone instigate, such a plan? But what others didn't know is that day after day, his employer was also his mentor, teaching Lucas the finer points of maintaining a crime organization. And when his employer dies, Lucas takes these teachings and realizes them.Lucas knows if there is demand for a product and/or service, even if illegal, there will be buyers. And they will pay a premium if supply is low and demand is high. And he also knows competition is inevitable. However, if he delivers a better product cheaper without compromising his profit, he could lure more customers away from his competition. And that's what Lucas does. By buying heroine and cocaine wholesale direct from war-ravaged Vietnam, he can cut out many-a middle man and sell better quality merchandise for less than the other mob bosses who are selling an inferior grade for more. Of course, it also means having a contact in Vietnam and paying off certain branches of law enforcement. And it also frustrates his competition who happen to be other mafia organizations. In the long run, it pays off as Lucas makes more dough than Texas oil magnates. But the catch is that it leads to bribery and killing.His nemesis, unknown to him for most of the movie, is Richie Roberts, a moral if obsessed cop, played equally brilliantly by Russell Crowe, who is trying to piece together the puzzle. As head of an undercover narcotics division in New York, he knows the dope is being delivered and sold, but he can't figure out who is running the show. The name and face of Frank Lucas surfaces but is tentatively discounted. A recurring theme throughout the movie is the assumption that Lucas must be working for someone higher up, which becomes a stumbling block. No one on the force can imagine that an African-American is a drug kingpin.The two stories run parallel, the investigation by Crowe and the story of Washington as the crime boss, moving toward the climax in which both stories collide. The plot is intricate and complex, and sometimes I wished the film would slow just a little bit to allow us to catch our breath so we could understand all the intricacies. Sometimes the hints are so subtle that it was hard to figure out all the threads. One sub-story involves Roberts' wife who files for divorce, which I thought was more of a distraction and didn't really relate to much else in the film. Instead, I wanted to hear more about the investigation. Still, an incredible movie, and again an Oscar-caliber performance by Denzel Washington.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

As he did in ""Training Day"" he stuns us with a turn as ""exceedingly bright black man who is in total control of everything, and actually already has it all figured out"".It's a testament to the strength of this picture that it's long running time just flies by, as you get lost in a fascinating story, very well told.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Each have a choice for which direction they want to live their lives and each choose almost polar opposite directions. Frank Lucas becomes the most feared gangster in America by selling drugs to his own people and trampling all the opposition while Richie Roberts takes the justice side of becoming the most hated police officer in the force because he does the right thing and doesn't cheat under the table. It is a fabulous tale of how their paths cross as one must take down the other to achieve his goal and in the process perhaps let another achieve his forgot dream as well.I don't want to reveal much more, but I will say this Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe nail their roles. One maybe flashier than the other, but I consider both just as great. There are a multitude of great supporting players here as well from Josh Brolin to Chiwetel Ejiofor. I think this reflects well upon the director Ridley Scott as he gets sort of Godfather effect from this crew.The film itself is edgy chalk full of violence from beginning to the volatile ending which has a great amount of twists. It begins with the burning a man and ends with burning of ones past in a new world. Beautiful circle screenplay here, but it is not without its problems as the middle section exemplifies with a confusing editing job about the chronological path of the film. That is about my biggest complaint of this film which is quite long with a running time of nearly 3 hours.It will satisfy fans of the trailer with its style and satisfy the critics with its structure and underlining story, but this film could have used a bit of trimming to save a bit of the confusion. Otherwise, I have no problem with this film following in The Departed footsteps.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Fun and exciting but seen it before,"One of the good gangster/mob epics, this movie is long and needs to be that way since it attempts to tackle two stories and two protagonists. However, despite the length the intensity and story will keep you engrossed throughout.It is the true life story of a crime boss in Harlem and an honest NYC detective fighting the drug war. One is a mob boss portrayed more as a businessman than a crook and has a very professional approach. The way he figures how to get, import and sell cheaper higher quality drugs than his competition is an interesting story. The other main character is an extremely honest detective whom is embedded in a profession filled with corruption. He is honest in his profession perhaps to compensate for the moral dilemma he faces from being dishonest in his personal life. A major theme of the movie was the corrupt policemen at the time in NYC who were taking bribes from drug dealers and taking advantage of the situation for their own personal benefit. This may remind you of a movie.The fact that it reminded me of another movie and many movies was a weakness of this particular film. It took ideas and themes from Serpico  the corrupt policeman, Scarface the rise and fall of power of an intense personality, Goodfellas the rise and fall of a gangster and the ratting out, and Heat with the oscillating story of the cop and gangster. I literally saw scenes being repeated. This movie wasn't as good as those older movies because it combined what all those movies did and therefore forfeited depth in any one particular theme. It was also not innovative by any means.However a very fun entertaining movie experience is created when all these elements of those great movies are put together and as a delightful relish the acting was good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Scott, Washington, Crowe in top form, in a solid crime drama","American Gangster tells the story of Frank Lucas, a gangster in the 70's who became a drug kingpin by selling his product cheaper than his competition. Richie Roberts is a cop trying to stop the flow of heroin into New York, and in turn trying to catch Lucas.This movie is based on a true story. Despite this however, there are some pretty clichéd moments in this movie. The Roberts character appears to be the only honest cop in the city, and Lucas comes over as a family man, like just about any drug-lord in a movie like this.Ridley Scott and screenwriter Steven Zaillian are striving for a movie epic like Micheal Mann's Heat, but there is a key difference. Heat, while dominated by the De Niro/Pacino pairing does have a number of subplots going on, giving the supporting cast things to do. Sadly here, Crowe and Washington simply blow everyone else off screen, leaving some decent actors, such as Josh Brolin, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Armand Assante, amongst others little to do.While Crowe is good as Roberts, this movie is dominated by Denzel Washington's performance. Charismatic, charming, yet brutal and deadly when he has to be, this could easily see him getting another Oscar nomination.The movie looks superb, like all Scott's movies, as is the attention to detail. It's a long, well-made, solid crime movie. Sadly however, it just falls short of being a great one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Will the real American Gangsters please stand up,"Sometimes the craft of a movie speaks for itself and is reason enough to recommend it. These days this often means a certain trade-off, since the audience gets a magnificent special-effects razzle-dazzle instead of a story, leaving the reviewer to praise the former and yearn for the latter. Not so Ridley Scott's ""American Gangster"", which scores high marks in every department and presents us with a crime- and police-drama of the tallest order.As the title suggests this is, like last year's ""The Departed"", yet another major walk down America's mean streets. And like Scorsese's Beantown yarn, Scott is not just simply confronting us with cops and lowlifes, but turns the American Dream on its ear.Here's a master class of capitalism seen through the eyes of Harlem-Crime-Lord Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), who during the Vietnam war rose to fortune and power by personally shipping in pure heroin from Vietnam and Thailand and selling it at discount prices. A sly scheme that enabled him to eliminate the middle-man, the competition and which made him a host of enemies. Among them the corrupt NYPD, who was turning over a substantial profit from reselling seized drugs and extorting the powers that were. In the middle of this dangerous quagmire honest New Jersey-cop Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) investigated both Lucas and his fellow officers and managed, in true Serpico-fashion, to bring the house of drugs down - at least for a split-second.Labeled as ""based on a true story"" ""American Gangster"" for once actually earns the overused header, which is usually there to legitimize utter fiction. Scott's drama pulls of the rare feat of staying within the worlds of a familiar genre, clichés included, and at the same time demystifies our notion of noble gangsters and crooked cops.Washington and Crowe are perfectly cast and provide their roles with the necessary gravitas and ambivalence. There's a sense of star power, but both leading men use their persona to take it to different levels. Washington's Lucas, mostly all charm as the drug-peddling benefactor of Harlem, unleashes bursts of violence and thereby undercutting any sympathy that may arise. Crowe's bulky physique is hammered by the characters sacrosanct work ethic, which keeps him close to the streets and away from his family.Populated with familiar faces in small roles, and new faces in larger ones, there is a seamlessness and believability to every part that makes the movie a joy to watch. Yes, there are a few too familiar and mannered performances. Armand Assante's Don Cattano is a rehash of a dozen other mob-baddies and Josh Brolin's evil cop could basically wear a sign that says so. But leaving this aside, it's an astonishing ensemble that stays true to the material, skillfully weaved together by distinguished writer Steven Zaillian. As in his legal-drama ""A Civil Action"" Zaillian uses procedural techniques to advance the plot and creates a solid canvas, which forms the starting-off point for Scott and his collaborators. Taking Arthur Max' ever superb production design and combining it with cinematographer Harris Savides' muted color palette, consisting of deep blacks that remind us of the great works of Gordon Willis, Scott and editor Pietro Scalia maintain a strong pace from start to finish, never loosing focus and accompanied by a seventies soundtrack let loose a rollicking soul-beat manifesto.After his paid holiday in Provence that resulted in the cutesy but bland ""A Good Year"", Scott now cooks up a fast-talking potboiler, turning themes of corruption and the necessity of crime into a depressing but always riveting street study. ""American Gangster"" shows the murky connection between crime and law, and of course their financial co-dependency. The movie argues, and rightly so, that terminating the drug or any illegal business would cause huge unemployment and seriously damage the economy, since all business is subject to one market force. So whether it's drugs, prostitution, weapons, Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, the trough is the same, as is the color of money.Now will the real American Gangsters please stand up!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Indeed A Decent Film,"The Ridley Scott mark is evident here simply because of the sprawling landscapes he is known far and wide for in telling the story of real-life crime lord Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) juxtaposed with the investigation and eventual capture by fictitious investigator Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe).The movie is fast-paced with a sweeping panorama of the period spotted with memorable performances. That being said, a glaring disappointment was Scott/s inability (refusal?) to adequately utilize the support of such stalwart actors as Ruby Dee & Chiwetel Ejiofor, both of whom provided substantial support that appeared to have fallen victim to the cutting room floor.An interesting parallel was indeed Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts as they both had enormous similarities, the biggest of which was their devotion to their work which seemed infinitely more important to them than their families. It is this poor prioritizing that provides the impetus for their actions. Crowe's character was somewhat more redeemable than Washingtons' whose character indeed had anger management issues which were all supposedly explained away because of societal pressures - blah, blah, blah...It is also interesting that many of Washington's characterizations don't necessarily warrant much attention unless they are somewhat less than socially redeeming.Notwithstanding, it is indeed a good film with flaws like any other (hardly a masterpiece) but well worth becoming a part of your film collection.

Get ready to be submersed...,"While I usually enjoy long movies, I wondered halfway through if I could enjoy this. But the movie quickly re-gained my interest and was intently interested for the rest of the night. The submersion into 60's Harlem gangster life was thorough; however this movie spends too little time showing what drugs ""really"" did to people during that time. The glamor and glitz was on the screen too often I thought, and I found myself rooting for Lucas at times. I won't say this is ""typical"" for Hollywood's glorification of violence and criminals, but it was getting close. Crowe delivered a convincing performance; I didn't even notice any Australian accent slipping through at all. Denzel Washington runs away with the story, even with a good supporting cast. I'm of the camp that says Denzel is Denzel in all his movies, pretty much the same character all the time, but this sort of movie calls for that guy.

Not Bad...But Needs Streamlining,"This is a very long movie. I must admit that I felt every minute of it. It is not that it is a bad movie. The story of Frank Lucas (played very well by Denzel Washington) and his rise from aide to top drug honcho during the turbulent and decadent late 60s to early 70s is very interesting. I thought this story alone would have made a pretty good movie in itself. His devotion to his boss, his commitment to his mother (Ruby Dee), his relationship with his wife, his violent streak, his business acumen, all make excellent However, this interesting storyline is interrupted by so many seemingly interfering events that were given too much time. The entire story involving the life of Russell Crowe felt like an entirely different movie altogether. But since he is Russell Crowe, the story of this policeman-lawyer, needed to be extended more than it really should. The character of Josh Brolin of the corrupt cop Trupo is also given too much time. That one episode involving Cuba Gooding Jr. was also quite incidental, not really material to the flow of the story.So overall, this is not a bad movie. I feel it needed streamlining.

New York and its dark side...,"In the post-war years, the most beautiful and controversial city in the world experienced all the evils that characterize large metropolises but, as in its style, amplified the results.

The two share the scene equally, one representing the ambitious and shy crime boss and the other an incorruptible policeman from New Jersey. Drugs in the background are the main business that dominates the scene and the way in which Ftrank Lucas (Denzel) obtains fictional drugs is a reality specific to those years during the conflict in Vietnam. The code of honor respected by the tough gangster clashes with the noisy competition and represents the ferocious desire for redemption of the black society of that era. On the other hand, the picture of absolute corruption of the police forces makes Richie (Russel) a stubborn and incorruptible white fly who will prevail in the end.

"Moral, fair, educating, intelligent and entertaining - all at the same time!","An enterprising black drug criminal and a whiter-than-white cop go head-to-head from the late 60's onwards.Life writes the best jokes and the best drama, so the lucky authors are simply those that write them down on paper first. If WE are lucky they are the great writers themselves and can frame the story in the best possible way. American Gangster falls short of being an all-time classic, but is clever enough to have studied (and learnt) from a wide range of movies from The French Connection through Serpico through to the quality TV of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. It also borrows from a few failed movies like New Jack City.It says in the bible that in the world of the blind the one-eyed man is king. Frank Lucas (Densil Washington) wasn't that smart, but he was smarter than those around him. Rather like Al Capone. If you listen hard enough to this production you can see he doesn't even follow his own limited advice! (I always judge criminals by their skill at staying out of prison - so Lucas can't really score very highly on my own Richter Scale.)Richie Robers (Russell Crowe, who you may be interested to know has a mother-in-law local to me and sometimes visits) is not a great all-round actor because he isn't that smart as a person (you can't play smart unless you really are smart - Brando's problem). He is best playing pig-head and obstinate working class types with a sense of fair play. So well done the casting department.Washington is the kind of actor that probably can't walk past a mirror and not look at himself. He refuses to wear the afro of that the real Frank Lucas sported and wants to be Joe Cool at any point when his life isn't endangered. Densil doesn't do sweaty or jerky anyway. In truth, he is getting a bit samey.The problem with movies is momentum and falling in to the trap of simply repeating yourself. Easy traps to fall in to when real life (which this is - in outline form) does the same. When this is good it is top class - when it sags (which it does at various points) it comes across like above average TV drama. Equally it can't walk away from cheap thrills and the blindingly obvious. I don't like being in the company of professional lookers of the other way. However saintly they are framed - they are freeloaders of the first order. Pimps of scum rather than plain scum.Moral issues are dealt with fairly and - to be frank - in an arbitrary manner. Thrown in from nowhere and going nowhere. Long shot of dead junkie and crying child from the book of movie cliché. Praise director Ridley Scott for including them (didn't have to), but about ten seconds thought has gone in to it.If I'd have written the piece I would have gone more for the early years - learning the biz on the knee of the famous (original black gangster) Bumpy Johnson. Indeed this point (suggested as fact in this movie) may not have been the whole truth and nothing but the truth.At the end I counted myself as very well entertained and curious enough to read more about the real people on the screen. The only downside is that Cuba Gooding Junior proves that unless he has a good script he just fades in to the wallpaper like an extra. No star charisma at all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

French Connection,"American Gangster immediately reminded me of French Connection - which I coincidentally had watched only a few days before I saw American Gangster. The main theme of both movies is a cat-and-mouse game between the gentleman head of a criminal organization and a rather gruff cop, based on a true story. In either case the Manhattan atmosphere is caught brilliantly, as is the era of the late 60s/early 70s. Thus I would conclude that if you liked the one, you will also enjoy the other.However, American Gangster is less dark and more glamorous, as it emphasizes on Frank Lucas' rise to wealth (and stylish lodgings) and is accompanied with an entertaining soundtrack.The main cast is great - especially Russel Crowe acts brilliantly again.Yet I have something to criticize. In my opinion, the character of Frank Lucas is too plain. He is described as a (only) two-dimensional person - the loving son and generous family guy on the one side and the hard criminal business man an the other side. Sadly, you hardly get to see any facets in-between, so that Lucas is bit of a cliché, q.v. any mafia movie.

Ridley Scott's finest acheivements.,"I've heard a little bit about this back in the day depending on what I've just heard or seen.

Solid But Not Great,"5 November 2007. Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe along with this time Denzel Washington put together a story that has a beginning, middle, and ending. This movie is no Godfather, and interestingly enough there are some casting decisions to include some aging actors recognizable from other crime thrillers that in my mind detracts from the hard-hitting, serious side of this story. The personal relationship between Washington and his bride is underdeveloped, in fact, their meeting is something of a mystery. Even Washington's character and his father is also underdeveloped which later plays a rather important part later in the movie. The Ridley Scott had both Russell and Denzel play more complicated characters each with both good and bad elements. The movie, however, seemed to overreach and incorporate some much by having to sacrifice some detail. Russell's character chasing after the bad guy in a drugbust seemed unnecessarily showy, more for the action crowd than for cinematic clarity. Denzel's confrontation with another dealer who wants him to pay 20% isn't particularly resolved. Overall,there are good performances, a complex plot that is handled well.

One of the best films of 2007!,"I'm not a huge fan of gangster flicks. Although I did enjoy watching the film Goodfellas, I must say I liked The Godfather but didn't like it as much as everyone else. But their was something about American Gangster that really caught my eye when working at my job at a movie theatre and as soon as I went inside to watch the movie, was I ever right. Denzel Washington is brilliant in this movie about gangster Frank Lucas' rise to power with Russel Crowe as the cop trying to hunt him down. The 2007 line up of movies has lately been disappointing me because some films (like this one) are great, but others (and a lot of them) are only half-decent or just bad (Hostel Part II). Nevertheless, if you're dying to see a good movie in theatres right now, look no further than American Gangster. I promise you right now you won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A nice movie with an age old core....,"The movie is basically that same old mafia thing.......but here its not Italian...its an American ... an American GAngster......... The movie starts up with a very violent scene which is not it is all about .......The movie mainly hovers around Denzel Washington..........and to be specific his part in the movie is the best out of the lot...background score is nice and screenplay n cinematography is also fine......Screenplay could have been better........One thing that is to be said everywhere this movie is discussed is that the movie is based on a real life story and that alone casts a huge impact on the viewers.....Also I forgot to mention Russell Crowe, He also has his part but one can see him being overshadowed by Denzel.......All in all I can say that the movie is okies...",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Nice movies clips,"Drama.The story of Frank Lucas, the man who built a massive drug empire largely from scratch, and Richie Roberts, the outcast cop who took him down. Shows Lucas' rise to power, through ingenuity, business sense and plain ruthlessness and how he managed to fly under the police's (and many other people's) radar for so long. Also shows how the cops eventually pinpointed him as the drug kingpin they were after, their investigations and how they eventually got him.Great storytelling from director Ridley Scott. He builds the details, and shows the history of the two protagonists, in parallel for a while. Then he builds the tension as everything comes together. In the end you have a great no-pretence, gritty, almost old-fashioned film noir gangster movie.Great work by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe in the lead roles. Good supporting cast too.On the negative side, there are a few sub-plots and scenes which seem unnecessary (eg the Cuba Gooding angle). In addition, there are some turns of events that seem implausible, especially towards the end (eg Roberts as both cop and prosecutor). This doesn't take too much away from quality of the movie though.Drama.The story of Frank Lucas, the man who built a massive drug empire largely from scratch, and Richie Roberts, the outcast cop who took him down.

A contemporary classic.,"A bit of history between this film and myself. I remember reading about this project being killed in 2005. It sounded like a fantastic film, (a Harlem drug lord who smuggled uncut heroin into New York? sign me up) that was unfairly killed due to a too-high $90 million budget (which the film wound up costing). I vowed that if I ever became a film director, I would get this film made. Cue two years later, I'm watching Knocked Up, and I see a trailer for the film that I had no idea was rescued from development hell. I made a mental note of the date, and have been looking forward to it since the first trailer premiered. When I finally saw it, it was actually better than the trailer implied. All of the actors are fantastic with Denzel Washington's moral gangster and Russel Crowe playing one of the few uncorrupt cops in the NYPD (channeling a bit of Al Pacino's Frank Serpico in a bit in the process as well). Ridley Scott's direction is smooth and guided, and the dialogue is cool and natural. The film breaths with the atmosphere and style of the late '60s and early '70s. Overall, I give American Gangster a solid 10/10.Films to view in addition to this: Serpico and The Godfather. The film seems to take inspiration from both films, both of which are magnificent as well and both star Al Pacino.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Well made movie, interesting story","I'll make it short: I didn't see anything wrong it. It's a great story, although not totally 'new', but who cares? It can't be new all the time. It's well casted, well acted, shots are fine, nothing wrong with it.==== spoilers ahead =====What i found particularly interesting about the story is the reality factor of it. In the 'scene', being a leading figure, you don't have to go around shooting people all the time like a loon. In fact, it's the opposite. You don't show off, cause a lot of people will hate you for it and will want to bring you down. Most interesting was the side story (one others oppose to) of Richie with his wife, where she blames him he is NOT corrupt. And that is a fact. It's peer pressure, group moral. Drugs feed a lot of mouths, directly or indirectly and people close around you usually don't care where you get your money from. They just want you to get the money and keep them out of harms way. That is realistic. So the hero and anti-hero are both heroes and both lose their families. Nobody cares for heroes longer than the spotlights are there.Such is life.The general said it: quitting isn't the same as quitting while you are ahead.And trying to save the world is rather silly and doesn't pay of, i can say from experience.Nice movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A Superb Film That Exceeds Expectations,"This viewer rented the DVD form of American GANGSTER, having passed it by in the theatrical run, thinking that it was yet another 'crime and corruption in New York' genre film. It was surprising to discover that this very long film (just under three hours in the Unrated version) is completely riveting and in a way far different than the usual gangster film: this story, based on real people as outlined in an article by Mark Jacobson (transformed for the screen by Steven Zaillian), and while it has its share of grisly killings, it seems more concerned with the issues of integrity in the face of police corruption as embodied in the character of Richie Roberts, the etiology of the heroin use escalation following the Vietnam War, and the presence of a 'Black Mafia' lead by one Frank Lucas. It is delivered with compelling gusto and intelligence by director Ridley Scott and has some of the best acting of the year. In other words, this is not a film to be lightly dismissed as a Hollywood retread, but instead it is a tense drama with many very fine points.Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) follows the footsteps of his idol Bumpy (Clarence Williams III) who 'ran' the Harlem streets, and when Bumpy dies, Lucas inherits his mantle. Lucas is wise, cunning, a gentleman, a powerhouse of ideas, and quickly finds a way to bring the best uncut heroin from the Far East to the streets of New York at a price that undercuts the other mobsters' product. To establish his control he enlists his family, including his brother Huey (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and rapidly becomes the kingpin of the streets.Simultaneously within the NYPD we meet Detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) whose personal life is a mess but who, with his partner Lou (Ted Levine) discovers corruption in the NYPD and more particularly the Drug Enforcement sector of the police: Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin) works with the existing drug lords, grabs their drugs and money and then recycles both to his benefit. During a particular drug bust, Richie and Lou discover a stash of nearly a million dollars and turn the money into the police - a deed that makes the duo seem foolish and lose the respect of their fellow cops but establishes Roberts as a man who is committed to being a good detective.From these two separate studies the film weaves the development of each character and the interaction between Roberts and Lucas we know will take place. The end result may be known to those who followed the story as it developed in the 1970s, but for those for whom this true story is new information, the resolution of the film is fast-paced, thrilling, illuminating, and just plain fine cinema. Both Washington and Crowe are in peak form, as are those in the many small roles (Ruby Dee, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Josh Brolin, Lymari Nadal, Carla Gugino, Cuba Gooding etc). This is more of a drama than an action film and while many may feel the final moments of the movie are weak, they do reveal the true ending of the story and say a lot about the narrow line between crime and criminal investigation. This is one of Ridley Scott's most successful films and one that will be around for many years as a model for the medium.Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Fighting events,"I guess this is a fictional retelling of actual events. The characters of frank is the story of a man whose own issues with the abuse of being a black man with few prospects , driven to become great . Unfortunately, his greatness is tied up in exporting pure heroine from Vietnam and selling it .He is a murderer ,a liar and every way a criminal .He is charming on the outside and deadly on the inside. There is no way that a thinking person could admire him. If his vendetta and his business were directed only at bad guys ,we might think that it is ok . But he kills indiscriminately, many dying as innocent victimsIt's so interesting to watch such a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
If....,"If This Film Doesn't Get Any Oscar Nominations, I Will Be Surprised. This Year was really generous in terms of REALLY GOOD movies and this is one of them.It has an unbelievable subtext, which is a rarity in latest Hollywood films. It talks about heroin not as a drug, but as a nice metaphor of modern culture. And the fact that the main characters are real life persons doesn't change anything. This to me is a movie more about America as a country, than just another gangster film. I still can't understand why people compare this movie with Scarface, for example.I don't think that Denzel Washington will win something (my personal favorite is Viggo Mortensen for Eastern Promises), but I really hope that Ridley Scott will get an Oscar for this film, because he deserved it. He deserved it before, but this film shows who he really is.Harris Savides - the DP of the film - is mind-blowing. What this guy does with colors and natural lighting is fantastic.So this movie might actually win some golden guys for Ridley Scott & Harris Savides.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Clarence Williams III,"I have searched and searched but it does not say who played Bumpy. why is he not on cast.was it Clarence Williams III? maybe it wasn't him. anyone know? i enjoyed this movie, thought i did not like Dezel as bad guy in Training Day, this was different. I looked up the New Yorkers article done in 2000. And the movie stayed true to that interview. It showed an era, just as in 30's gangster movies or prohibition movies.two teenagers about 14 were in audience and when we left, i over heard them asking ""Why if the had all that evidence on him, did he get out"" i left them to their conversation, but i thought ""Let's Make a Deal.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
One of the best movies of the year,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in this present year. So powerful, so breathtaking and full of action and drama. Based on true, The story about the rise and fall of Harlem's drug kingpin Frank Lucas, its so interesting. Of course we can't compare this movie with some other gangster masterpieces like Goodfellas, The Godfather and Scarface but easily can be situated below this three as one of the best. The direction from Ridley Scott is perfect, its so wonderful how he tells a story and keep it interesting for almost three hours. The adaptation of the late 60's and early 70's New York is amazing and the music great. The cast is simply excellent, flawless performances from everyone. Denzel's role is awesome, although he is the bad guy, you finish liking him. I was sure he was going to be nominated for an Oscar as best actor in a leading role but anyway. Russell Crowe is also flawless as officer Richie Roberts. Secondary roles from Josh Brolin, Cuba Gooding Jr and others gives a perfect support to Crowe and Washington. Definitely as I said before this is one of the best movies of the year, a must see for everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Josh and Mark Review,"American Gangster is probably the best film i have seen from 2007 apart from possibly Superbad. It involved some great shooting scenes and had a gripping storyline. I feel that films that are based on true events create a great feeling and emotion as you no that the scenes would be similar to those of real people. Although Denzel plays a horrible man bringing heroine in to the US, inside dead soldier's coffins you feel a bit worried when he is finally busted. Although he has been bringing in possibly the deadliest drug on the planet he has been doing so to provide him and his family with a life that they possibly do deserve. Richie Roberts (Russel Crowe) plays a good part in the drama as well, providing the chase on Frank (Denzel). Gangsters are not his only problem in the film either he has to struggle with his family life as he enters court trying to stop his ex wife leaving the state with his son. But does he really deserve him?. If this wasn't enough for the underrated cop he is faced with croockid policemen through out the film, being payed of by big dealers to let all kinds of drugs into the country. As Richie gets closer and closer to busting Frank he realises that it is not only the gangsters causing the trouble in the city. When he finally catches Frank in the big bust at the end of the film, both men work together to try and get Denzels sentence lowered and to catch the police offers braking the law and it turns out there are a few more than were first expected.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"another fine piece of cinema from our boy, ridley","American Gangster ties with Eastern Promises as one of the two top crime dramas of 2007. It had a well structured story, a good cast and fine directing by none other than the best.There is one thing I take into account when I watch a ""cops vs. criminals"" film: protagonists and antagonists. Personally, I usually do not care much for the concept. If it is a fictional film then characters can be played out any way that works. In a movie based on a true story however, I prefer to see every character as human beings. American Gangster accomplished that. Frank Lucas was not some evil sadistic heroine kingpin. He was a man of ethics who decided to go into a dirty business. Richie Roberts wasn't a decorated police officer that everyone looked up to. He had to make tough choices when it came to whose side he was on. These people weren't played out to be perfectly good or bad. It made the movie very authentic to the real world and the real story.I am among the many who believe Ridley Scott deserves that Academy Award he has coming to him. He has made some of the greatest movies of the past several decades. From science fiction to war to historical and many other genres in between, the man has accomplished more than most directors ever could. Ridley is a true artist, and American Gangster can be added to the list of proof that he is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
The Rise And Fall Of Empires,"This is one of the better ""ganster/mob"" films that I've seen in recent years, basically because of the way the movie manages to blend personal story lines in an unromanticized way into the grimy reality of life in the underworld.The movie revolves around the story of Frank Lucas (an excellent performance by Denzel Washington) who starts off the story as the driver to one of Harlem's leading gangsters and traces his rise to the head of New York City's drug trafficking lords. As with many ""mob"" stories, the truly frightening thing in many ways is how normal this guy's life is away from ""work."" He's got a mom who loves him and who he takes to church every week, a beautiful wife who seems totally in love with him, a nice home, powerful and apparently legitimate friends and he runs his business - his drug business, and a legitimate club that presumably helps to account for some of his money. Starting off with basically nothing after the mobster he works for dies, Lucas ruthlessly rises to the top in a businesslike fashion, by importing high quality drugs from Thailand, using US military planes as transports.Russell Crowe on the other hand is Detective Richie Roberts, an honest cop - one of the few apparently, and ostracized by other cops for turning in almost a million dollars rather than keeping it. One of the most memorable lines in the movie belongs to his partner (played by John Ortiz) who says by way of warning what awaits them on the force and in an attempt to convince Roberts that they should keep the money ""cops who turn in a million dollars also turn in other cops."" (In other words, there's not a cop on the force who'll trust you enough to work with you after this.) When that prediction turns out to be true, Roberts ends up heading a federal investigation into drug trafficking, and Lucas becomes his chief prey.The story of dishonest cops, mainly represented by Det. Trupo (Josh Brolin) provides the continuous backdrop to the movie, and it's very well done. It's a shocking note at the end of the movie that three quarters of the NYC Drug Enforcement Agency ended up being charged in the federal investigation.This is a very good blending together of these three stories, based on fact and brilliantly acted by Washington and Crowe, as well as the supporting cast. It's violent, but not gratuitously so. The last bit of the movie (featuring the co-operation between Lucas and Roberts after Lucas is caught) seems to fly by a little bit too fast, and one of the closing captions tells us that Lucas was released from prison in 1991, but doesn't tell us what he's been doing since then, which I would have liked to have found out - did he go back to the life, or did he stay straight? Aside from that, though, this is a very good movie that will not disappoint. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
