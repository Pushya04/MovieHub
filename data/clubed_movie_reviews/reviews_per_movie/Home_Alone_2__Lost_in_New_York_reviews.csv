Merry Christmas You Filthy Animals,"I actually enjoy this one more than the first. Love seeing some of the iconic sites of New York City, and just what it looked like in 1992.A very similar formula to the first but obviously set in NYC, so there was a lot of potential for different ideas which I felt they capitalized on. Steady laughs throughout from all the characters. The addition of Tim Curry was amazing. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern crack me up in their roles as the Wet/Sticky Bandits.A very good sequel that delivers in pretty much every way, especially the Christmas feels.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Why are most of the reviews negative? This is almost better than the original,"I love this movie. It is not as good as the first movie but that isn't because it is not funnier, or it in general just isn't as entertaining. It is because it copies the first film way too much. A lot of stuff has a really low chance of happening, just like the original, and without spoiling it I will just say its very similar. Now that we are finished the bad things about this movie, lets get to the good things! This movie is the funniest film out of the Home Alone franchise, and I think most people will probably agree with me on that. Macaulay Culkin did really well, and so did everyone else in the main cast. This movie is almost as good as the original, (which is also 8/10) but I
I wish the story was a bit more original.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
I love it!,"""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" is young Macaulay Culkin's second greatest hour in the series as Kevin McCallister, who has to learn to be a man again on the mean streets of the Big Apple after being separated from his family once more. He checks into a swank Manhattan hotel (where Donald Trump is apparently staying at too). He's pursued again by comic bad guys Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), and director Chris Columbus and screenwriter John Hughes keep the action and laughs coming. Tim Curry also appears as a concierge who has to prove that Kevin is on his own, and Brenda Fricker is the pigeon lady who watches over Kevin's little shoulder. There is another tricks & traps showdown at the end, which keeps the slapstick and comic violence at an all-time high.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Same plot. Same actors. New traps. No problem.,"Home Alone 2 has pretty much the same plot as the first movie, but Home Alone 2 is a very good sequel. The new traps for the Wet, er... Sticky Bandits are great. Once again Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern give wonderful performances. Having Tim Curry in this was also a treat. There is a lot of enjoyment in this movie.",,Anonymous,Crime
Less a sequel than it is a remake,"Two years later, and the McAllister family are setting out to spend Christmas in Miami. However, ten year old Kevin who was previously left home alone finds himself separated from his family and accidentally boards the wrong Airplane. Finding himself stranded in New York City. Although he finds himself enough cash and credit cards to at least have some. It's short lived however, when the Wet Bandits Harry and Marv, who Kevin gave the runaround two year before crossed his path yet again. Plotting to carry out a major holiday heist, Kevin proves once again to be the fly in their ointment. Concocting another series of booby trap that will leave them smarting once again.Two years after the major smash hit that was Home Alone, it should have come as no surprise that Chris Columbus and John Hughes would once again collaborate on this 1992 sequel. With the 1990 original having raked in $476.7 million on a $18 million budget. Making it the then highest grossing comedy live action comedy ever. So with dollar sign on their eyes Home Alone 2: Lost in New York they delivered this this manufactured follow up. One has to wonder if we really needed one, but here it was and one word comes readily to mind in describing it. Déjà vu.Substituting the Chicago suburb setting from the first movie for the bright lights of Manhattan Island. There's an obvious attempt to put a fresh new spin on the same formula that worked so well in the first movie. In spite of the incredulous set up, Home Alone was still a fun if ridiculous concept. But with Lost in New York we get much of the same narrative ideas that have been repackaged. Never mind the contrived set-up that in the mother of all coincidences, see's Macaulay Culkin Kevin locking horns once again with Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern's Wet Bandits from the first movie. There's the adage of Brenda Fricker's homeless bag lady, who he is initially fearful of but finds himself befriending. Sound familiar? As well as retooling other old gags from the first outing, with a sequel to the black & White Gangster flick. Some of it works better than might expect while in other respects it's a matter of been there, seen that.There are one or two little neat conceits added to the mix with Kevin armed with his recordable walkman, and his Dad's credit card booking himself a room to check into the Plaza Hotel. Which raises the suspicions of Tim Curry's concierge who proves some of the movie's funnier moments. While all the while, Kevin's frantic (John Heard and Catherine O' Hara) parents search what seems in vein to locate their son.Culkin as before is once again in fine form, and his comic timing is pitch perfect. He has a charming little scene with veteran actor Eddie Bracken as the kindly old owner of the Toy Store that the Wet Bandits plan to burgle. Kevin this time around is also presented in a more sympathetic light, whose frustration at his family feels a little more justified. Although again, this ground had been pretty much covered before.As far as the inevitable slapstick is concerned it's a mixed bag, with Hughes really pushing the ouch factor to breaking point. Some of the punishment Kevin doles out proves to really challenge the audience's threshold to the point, where it feels unnecessarily sadistic rather than funny. Although a moment involving a tea-trolley had audiences rolling in the aisles. It doesn't have the same laugh factor consistency of the first film. Less a sequel, it would be fairer to call it a remake. It gives in to the law of diminishing returns. A sequel which although serviceable feels like an exercise in box checking, which we didn't really need in the first place.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A blockbuster sequel from Chris Colombus and sensitive score by John Williams.,"¨Home alone: Lost in New York¨ (1992) by Chris Colombus boasts a good cast with Macaulay Culkin, Daniel Stern, Joe Pesci, Tim Curry, Brenda Fricker, Eddie Bracken, Rob Schneider, Dana Ivey, Catherine O'Hara, John Heard. On this occasion, little Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) goes in the middle of Christmas, with his family to the airport in order to enjoy a short Christmas vacation with the family, but he boards the wrong plane that takes him to New York, where he is again alone and unprotected. As if this were not enough, the boy meets Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marvin (Daniel Stern), the thieves from the last installment who escaped from prison, and they want to take revenge. Bring Home The Laughter This Holiday Season!. Holy cow!. Start spreading the news. Guess who's alone in New York this Christmas!. Another Christmas in the trenches. He's up past his bedtime in the city that never sleeps. Yikes! I did it again! First, he was home alone, now he's lost in New York When Kevin's family left for vacation, they forgot one minor detail: Kevin.Given the success achieved with the first installment, one of the most commercial films of all time, filmmakers John Hughes (as producer and screenwriter) and Chris Colombus, return in this second installment and first sequel, joining their efforts for this Christmas sequel to the film that made little Macaulay Culkin famous.This megahit produces funny gags, genuine laughs, violent jokes, amusement, entertainment and incorporating fresh material. It was a almost exact duplication of the original including cartoon violence. Boarding the wrong plane , troublemaker Kevin lands in NYC, where he meets crooks Pesci y Stern as prison escapees; not so much a sequel, more of an action replay but even more violent than the original. Macaulay Culkin is as adorable as ever with supporting cast all delivering fine interpretations. Although with an unlikely premise triggering the story, Kevin turns into a pint-sized Rambo defending himself with the resources and wile of a boy genius with a perfect timing and unlimited intelligence.Kevin's new Christmas adventures are supported by a much larger budget. Joining Culkin in the cast are Joe Pesci (Godfellas), Daniel Stern (A Place Called Miracle), Catherine O'Hara (Orange Country), John Heard (Awakenings). And Brenda Ficket (My Left Foot) and Tim Curry (The Rocky Horror Picture Show) join this fun saga too.The saga is formed by: ¨Home alone¨(1990) by Chris Colombus with Macaulay Culkin, Daniel Stern, Joe Pesci, John Heard, Robert Blosson, Billie Bird, Kieran Culkin, Devin Ratray, Kristin Minter. ¨Home alone: Lost in New York¨ (1992) Tim Curry, Brenda Fricker, Eddie Bracken, Rob Schneider, Dana Ivey, Catherine O'Hara, John Heard. ¨Home Alone 3¨ (1997) by Raja Gosnell (editor of the two previous films) with Alex D Linz taking over for the teenaged Culkin, Kevin Kilner, Olek Krupa, Lenny Van Dohlen, Haviland Morris, Scarlett Johansson; here some international criminals trying to recover a microchip stashed in a toy car that has the mistakenly left home alone Alex Linz, while attempting to foil their plans, this sequel fails to carry the charm of its predecessors.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Yes, same plot, but it still gets the same laughs as the first one did if not more","Now I'm aware that Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is the exact same plot as the first Home Alone, and not to mention how silly it seems that these folks would leave their kid behind, but come on, this movie was all in good fun. It still has me constantly laughing 'till this day, I think if you loved the first Home Alone, I'm sure that you'll just naturally love this one as well. Not too many folks are just giving it a good chance. I mean, the Wet Bandants are back and they are just as funny as ever! I think this house that Kevin set up was actually in some ways a little more fun than the first because of the traps he was able to set. Not to mention the Plaza Hotel plot was so great and fun to watch.Kevin and his family are heading down to Florida for Christmas this year, but when Kevin gets mixed up at the air port and gets on the wrong flight, he ends up in New York. Instead of complaining or panicking, he just plain enjoys it. He goes on the ultimate tour with his father's bag of money and credit cards and cons himself into the Plaza Hotel claiming he's there with his dad. But the Wet Bandants who have now re-named themselves as the Sticky Bandants are in New York as well and are planning on stealing all the money from a toy store that is going to be given to the children's hospital. But Kevin is going to make sure that they don't mess around with the kids and has set his uncle's abandoned apartment up for a fun house of traps.Home Alone 2: Lost in New York was an absolute blast. The reason I'm giving it a ten is because I think the rating should be higher. People really need to give this movie a shot. My favorite scene is without a doubt when Marv gets hit in the face with the bricks, also, the scene where the Plaza Hotel managers are asked by Kevin's mom ""What kind of idiots do you have working here?!""... the lady just smiles and says ""The finest in New York!"", it was just too funny! I love this movie and I'm always going to recommend it for a good watch, I think you'll enjoy it if you give it a chance.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Christmas Classic, part II","Home Alone 2: Lost In New York picks up exactly where Home Alone left off. The movie follows faithfully the tried and tested method that brought huge success to the original, meaning that anyone who enjoyed the first movie should find this equally entertaining.Despite the obvious similarities between the two movies, there are a couple of important additions that differentiate them and should satisfy any skeptic viewers. First and foremost, this time around the action is transferred to New York, an ideal setting for a Christmas adventure. Secondly, the new members of the cast provide us with some memorable performances, the greatest of them being Tim Curry - honourable mention to Eddie Bracken's touching portrayal of Mr. Duncan.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
My personal favourite of the franchise,"The first Home Alone is very good indeed. The last two are just wannabes and feel like they don't belong. Home Alone 2 is my personal favourite, and I watch it about once a month. The only problem is that the jokes are basically retreads of the first movie, but believe me, they're miles better than the ones in the fourth ( which is one of the worst movies ever) This is still a very solid film, that gets slow in the second half. The performances are excellent. Macaulay Culkin brought a lot of charm to almost all the movies he's been in. Just a shame, he isn't acting any more. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are hilarious, as always. Catherine O'Hara and John heard are amiable as the parents, while the wonderful Tim Curry gives a hilarious performance as the Concierge. My favourite scenes were the bathroom scene in the hotel, and when the staff are held hostage by a television. Just priceless. Eddie Bracken and Brenda Fricker also make appearances, and their scenes are touching, as they are of friendship and acceptance. I absolutely adored the soundtrack too, New York looks splendid and the Plaza Hotel was incredible to look at. Brilliant movie! 9/10. Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Prolonged torture = LOL,"This movie does not work.Making a movie featuring over-the-top cartoon violence CAN work, but only if you never slip out of cartoon mode. A part drama/part cartoon is not going to work. You can't, for example, make a scene with a little kid having a touching conversation with a lonely homeless woman and immediately follow it up with wacky cartoon antics. When you do that, your movie stops being funny and becomes extremely disturbing.In the first ""Home Alone,"" Kevin only seemed interested in maiming the villains; in this one he is apparently trying to kill them. Case in point: the scene where he is throwing bricks at Marv's head. Not dropping them, but actually THROWING them at the guy's face. From this point on Kevin turns into some sort of demon child on par with the kid from ""Pet Sematary"" as he tries burning, electrocuting, and cracking open the skulls of his victims while shouting things like, ""Nice night for a neck injury!"" (He actually says that). The thought of a theater full of young children laughing at two men being brutally tortured for half an hour really creeps me out.The only possible reason to watch this is for Tim Curry, one of the world's greatest actors and who steals every scene he's in, but otherwise it's a waste of time.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

Strike While the Iron Is Hot,"This is the typical Hollywood effort to capitalize quickly on a financial success. It's not that there isn't some fun here, but everything seems much more contrived. Of course, the fact that Kevin is left behind again is the first contrivance. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are now the ""Sticky Bandits"" and are out of jail. The family is in New York and things begin to fall apart. Of course, what this is really about, is how much abuse one can inflict on the two idiots as they try to pull off a huge heist. Add the elements of their actions affecting poor children and the appearance of the bird lady in Central Park, we have efforts to pull at our heartstrings. Things ring hollow, mainly because the first movie did this well and this one didn't. There is one nice part of this movie and that is the byplay between Culkin and the irrepressible Tim Curry, the receptionist at the Plaza Hotel. I never miss anything Curry is in because he sparkles with evil joy. Watch this movie to see Curry. I have determined I will never invest on minute in Home Alone III.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Weak Sequel,"""Home Alone 2"" clones virtually every aspect of the original,without adding anything new or funny. The plot is basically the same except this time the movie takes place in New York and not in a house. Macaulay Culkin gives a decent performance but he can't save this movie.

More Christmas Fun. Although too much copied from Original,"If you had watched Home Alone 2 before the original you would probably have enjoyed it more. Unfortunately for me there is just too many similarities to the original. Obviously the producers were looking to cash in on the enormously popular original and didn't want to sway to far away from what made it a success . But for me there is just too much regurgitation. It does have a few new elements and a few new enjoyable characters and overall the Movie is still a festive fun filled family adventure and no doubt all the elements I have touched on which are direct copies from the first is what probably appeals to younger family members. I have a nostalgia for Home Alone 2 and still watch It each year. But I don't hold it in the same regard as the original and with that in mind, a 6 is the most it can expect.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Christmas Classic in New York,"Macaulay Culkin – one of the most famous child stars since Shirley Temple – returns as Kevin McAllister in the 1992 nostalgic and sentimental slapstick Christmas classic that has not dated since its original release.As the sequel of the highest grossing comedy of all time, Home Alone 2 is one of the biggest Christmas films of the 90s. Along with its predecessor, the story is all about Christmas. While the familiar Christmas vacation is shown as chaotic and stressful, it is the essential family element that brings us back to the films main themes of togetherness and (paradoxically) independence.Becoming separated from his family once again when leaving for a Christmas holiday, Kevin is left alone to his own devices, this time in New York City and causes chaos and mayhem when he bumps into the freshly escaped ""Wet Bandits"", who are once again, out to get him.The original cast return with Culkin in the lead, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as the hilariously dumb, yet slightly endearing criminals with a heart of coal and the fantastic Catherine O'Hara as the mum every child wants, played with just the right amount of fear, guilt, determination and love that is needed. Another noteworthy return is the sequel of gangster spoof Angels with Filthy Souls, Angels with Even Filthier Souls (a reminiscent construction of Angels with Dirty Faces with James Cagney.) New characters are brought to life by Tim Curry, Brenda Fricker, Eddie Bracken, Dana Ivey and a young Rob Schneider.Film critics such as Roger Ebert gave the film negative reviews and saw it as portraying violence as too cartoonish. Despite this fact, the mainstream popularity of the film saw it as a success and to most children of the 90s, the second instalment in the Home Alone series is often seen as equal in quality if not better than the first.This film has been monumental in my life. I cannot remember how I first saw it, but I know that thanks to VHS I watched it a million times. It formed my quintessential idea of New York by using Central Park, Carnegie Hall and the Plaza Hotel as central plot settings. It is as much a Christmas film as it is a New York City film and this familiar touristy promotion shows New York as being a unique ""White Christmas"" town.So in the cheery Christmas words of Johnny the Crook from Angels: Merry Christmas you filthy animaland a Happy New Year.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Big trouble in the Big Apple,"My wife and I are just back from five days in New York and even though this movie was made 25 years ago, with so many of its landmarks unchanged, it certainly enhanced our enjoyment of the film especially as we'd somehow never seen it before.Watching it on the run-up to Christmas helped too but the fact of the matter is that the movie's highly entertaining and enjoyable anyway. I get that McCauley Culkin's goofy grin, floppy hair, big ears plus of course that scream of his might irritate some but I otherwise found all these plus his smartness and rebelliousness quite acceptable.I enjoyed the way the writer and director, knowing that this is a sequel bound to end up with the same slap-sticky, booby-trapped conclusion as its mega-successful predecessor found a clever and even credible way to separate Kevin again from his family. I loved the New York winter locations while on the acting side, I equally enjoyed the cameo as toy-store owner Mr Duncan by veteran Eddie Bracken, who starred in so many great Preston Sturges films of the 40's. John Williams also delivers a playful soundtrack in keeping with the frivolities depicted on the screen.In these and other ways, director Chris Columbus harks back to those Golden Age Hollywood days, not by coincidence is ""It's A Wonderful Life"" referenced again in one of his movies, but here too he contributes a lasting seasonal classic which I dare say will likewise be watched and enjoyed by families at Yule time down the years.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Minor changes are made: more violence and characters, moving the location to New York City, and changing the taste of the story. And the all-important humor is recycled!!! --","There are different tastes in this film. Those who like the film say it is still fun, while those who dislike it say it is exactly the same as the previous film.The McAllisters, a large family, are planning a Christmas trip to Miami. They are almost late and in their haste, they leave Kevin at the airport as they did last year. Kevin follows someone dressed like his father and gets on a flight to New York. When Kevin arrives in New York, he checks into a hotel with his father's card and uses his wits and a voice recorder to cover up the fact that he is alone in New York.He goes to a toy store and meets a kindly old man. He tells us that ""Mr. Duncan"" is going to donate all the proceeds from this Eve to the hospital. When he leaves the store, he is caught by two thieves who once broke into Kevin's house. Kevin frames the two men for molestation. He manages to escape. He walks frightened through the eerie New York streets at night and meets a woman who is swarming with pigeons. At first he is afraid of her, but she saves him and he goes to the attic of a concert hall. After being advised to do something nice, Kevin decides to fight off the thieves and save the sick children and Mr. Duncan.It's a very long synopsis, but it can't be helped as there is a great deal of foreshadowing in the first half of the film. In my opinion, the blatant storyline is saved by the action and new elements.As bad as 3 was, Macaulay Culkin will prove to be very important to Home Alone. His sly Kevin character is delightful and funny. He may be a little less funny in 2, but that is saved by the hilarious characterizations around him.Also, while closer to comedy than action, the thief being taken advantage of by the kid is overtly funny, and while it's not fresh since we saw a smattering of it last time, I still felt the idea still somewhat worked. We think one factor is that, unlike last time, the majority of the film is not invaded by this comedy.The new additions to the story are also pleasing to us. I will tell those who criticize us for repainting the previous film by increasing the scale of violence and location, but it is not only the violence that has increased. I don't know if this will satisfy you, but there is some humor in Kevin relaxing gracefully in the hotel. Also, the increased characterization makes it more interesting.Minor changes are made: more violence and characters, moving the location to New York City, and changing the taste of the story. And the all-important humor is recycled!!! -- The idea that this will fool the audience is obvious. We know this.

There's just one snag-Joe Pesci and Daniel Sterns are back as Harry and Marv and once again, young Kevin must outwit them.The plot is pretty similar to Home Alone but don't let that put you off-it just means you've got more of the same thrills and fun to enjoy. Despite being lost in the city that never sleeps, Kevin again manages to find ways to outwit the relentless burglars who take countless bumps and bruises, many of which would have killed them but that's the fun of movies.Yes, Home Alone 2 was a fantastic follow up to Home Alone and it was followed by the equally excellent Home Alone 3.",,Anonymous,Crime

"I knew it was you, I could SMELL ya getting' off the elevata","Too many sequels suffer from Deja Vu, and hardly any of those carbon copies improve upon the original. Home Alone 2 is a carbon copy, but it's also much better and more complex a movie than the first. In another mad rush to the airport the McCallisters make a point of remembering Kevin this time, but he gets lost in a crowd at the airport and follows a man who looks like his dad onto the wrong plane. Thirteen of the McCallisters are going to Miami for Xmas (do they never stay at home?) but Kevin is headed for the Big Apple, and he's going to have that once-in-a-lifetime vacation he's been wishing for.There's much more for Kevin to see and do in New York. He scams his way into the Plaza hotel where a suspicious Concierge (Tim Curry) gives him mighty evil looks at every encounter. He goes to Duncan's Toy Chest, the biggest toy store in town and takes many scenic photographs. Though it is a little unnerving now seeing Kevin on the roof of the World Trade Centre.But the Wet Bandits have escaped, and they have just arrived in New York with loftier ambitions and bigger heists to pull off. They even brush by Kevin a few times not knowing he's there. Typically though, once they get a hold of him the give away far too much info. Once Kevin escapes he takes matters into his own hands once more. His Aunt Georgette from the first movie is still in Paris so he uses her half-renovated home as a huge mousetrap for the bungling burglars.The booby traps this time are much more painful and nasty, so it's all the more amusing for us. Who can possibly fail to laugh at Marv getting the shock of his life when he tries to turn on the taps? If the movie were to be released now I doubt if it would be let away with a PG rating. Still, it's nothing for any parents to worry about. Unless you fear your child is going to set your head on fire with a blowtorch.Home Alone 2 has a more satisfying climax than the first. The film doesn't simply end once Harry and Marv are back in the slammer as there is more plot to it than that. Brenda Fricker has a (rather questionable) role as 'The Pigeon Lady' a woman who lives in Central Park and talks to no one-until Kevin reaches out. Plus Eddie Bracken shows up as Mr. Duncan and gives Kevin the best Christmas morning ever as a token of his appreciation.With a bigger story (okay, some of it re-used) and more characters and a better playground for Kevin, Home Alone 2 manages to be a superior sequel. While not excessively so. There's loads of fun to be had in Kevin's antics, and Tim Curry is downright brilliant as the mischievous Concierge.It's a great movie on it's own but sadly it will always be called a copycat. Watch it now from a fresh perspective and you might like it more.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

The main character being once agian abandoned by his family then getting into mischief in New York by himself and eventually beating up some bad guys. The one thing that bothers me is the beginning as this film so closely follows the first in how it's done that it comes off extremely lazy.

I think what happens is writers become overzealous with ideas, and they end up including too many of them in the film, instead of taking out some during the editing phase. The first Home Alone was funny enough. Kevin McCallister (Culkin) is back a couple years later at the age of 10. As if they're not irritating enough, we have to watch his family treat him like garbage again. This time around, they're going to Miami for Christmas. It was Paris a couple years before (it's weird how they don't spend Christmas at home, considering they have a beautiful house). His nasty uncle, his wife, and their kids are staying at his house a second time. After Kevin's older brother Buzz humiliates him at his choir recital, and then gives an insincere apology once they're back home, he explodes on his family, calling his uncle a cheapskate. They need counseling. There's so much hate, resentment, and cruelty, all directed at Kevin, which causes him to lash out and say something insulting. Just like in the last movie, his parents think the only way to correct his behavior is by making him spend the rest of the night in the attic. Of course they oversleep, again, and run through the airport. Kevin is distracted from trying to put batteries in his voice recorder. His family gets lost in the crowd, and he ends up chasing behind a man who's wearing a coat that's identical to his father's, leading him to get on the wrong plane, and he's bound for New York City.The same thing basically happens as it did in the original, him living on his own like a miniature adult. He goes sightseeing after his arrival, checks himself into a fancy hotel using his dad's credit card, orders a ton of room service, and takes a dip in the pool. He has fun when he's not with his family, obviously because they're toxic, but he always starts to miss them after a while. I feel like this movie would be tolerable, if it wasn't so long. Seriously, it's two hours. When he has the misfortune of encountering Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), that's when the story becomes kind of boring. The writers didn't make good use of timing like they did in the first Home Alone. The only thing that was different, was the lethality of Kevin's booby traps. He set all of them up in his other uncle's brownstone. The house is being renovated, and therefore a safety hazard. Come to think of it, if this movie was real life, Kevin probably would've gotten injured himself. But in the world of make believe, he's able to avoid getting hurt, and lifts a few heavy objects that are taller than he is. The traps were funny in the first Home Alone. It was more or less harmless slapstick. Harry and Marv just would've broken some bones, but here, they were almost killed. It was hard for me to watch. I had developed pericoronitis. The pain was so unbearable that I was crying. Thankfully I was able to get a dentist appointment the next day, and I started taking an antibiotic. But a few hours later that same evening, watching them land on their back after falling through holes in the floor and their body parts getting smashed made me feel worse. I even stopped looking. It wasn't cartoonish, but actually kind of disturbing. And the movie's nowhere close to ending after they've been through all of his traps. The remakes that came after this are actually more entertaining. Unless you like long films that aren't action or thrillers, then you'll be able to sit through Home Alone 2 with no problem.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"an useless sequel to ""home alone""","When you watch this film for the first time, you can ask yourself this question ""was it useful to make a sequel to one of the most successful films made in 1990?"". The answer is obviously not. The only interest of the film is commercial. Indeed, John Hughes and Chris Colombus felt like renewing with the huge success of ""Home Alone"". Although this film was average, it was quite funny but, here, its sequel is very poor and disappointing. The film takes back too many elements from the first and as a consequence, it doesn't create surprises any more. For example, when Kevin is at the Plaza Hotel, he's watching, apparently, a detective film, and we know that the man, in the film, will kill the young lady as it was the case in Home Alone with the two men on the video. On the other hand, Kevin's weird neighbour was considered a slayer for a long time; but then Kevin found out that he was an unhappy man. In the film, a tall woman who brings up pigeons took the place of Kevin's neighbour and like this man, she's apparently threatening, but then again, like the man, she had a miserable life. So the film is deprived of originality. Moreover, the screenplay is always predictable and sometimes it's unlikely: Kevin's traps are more dangerous than in the previous film and however the two burglars don't seem to suffer a lot. At last Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci aren't very funny, Stern is even ridiculous and dumb. In 1997, a third sequel was made but with a different actor instead of Macaulay Culkin in the main role. Let's hope, there won't be a fourth.",,Anonymous,Crime
Carbon copy lacks the wistful appeal of the original...,"MACAULAY CULKIN is back again as the little lost boy who seems to have the ability to lose his parents at airports in HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK. While the plot fails to be as engaging as the original, a big asset is all of the New York location photography that gives us great glimpses of the big city for an added dose of realism.It starts out pretty much the way the original did, with the family planning a Florida vacation and with Kevin pursuing all of them as they make a mad dash through the airport. This time, he doesn't deliberately stay behind--he mistakenly believes he's following a man wearing a coat similar to his father.But what's really missing are the characters that made HOME ALONE such a treat--and they aren't topped by the bird lady sequence and her friendship with the boy, nor are the bungling exploits of bad guys JOE PESCI and DANIEL STERN as funny, even though they are as clueless as ever in trying to deal with Culkin's nasty pranks.The violence employed by Culkin gets even nastier this time, which turns out to be a drawback because, after all, this isn't a cartoon where we know no one is really getting hurt.But in general, the story moves swiftly, the parents' reaction to discovering that he's lost is just as funny (as is their encounter with an official while trying to explain the situation), and the supporting cast does their best to keep things lively. Nice to see EDDIE BRACKEN as a toy store mogul in a huge toy store where a key scene takes place.Fans of HOME ALONE will no doubt appreciate this sequel, but they aren't likely to be as fond of it as the original--which had a wistful sort of charm totally lacking here.John Williams' score is a pleasing asset, once again providing a sprightly backdground that gives the film added cheer.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Had good momentum but then he had to go find a house,"Macaulay Culkin is still cute one year later. This time Kevin gets on the wrong plane. He goes to New York and his family to Miami. Kevin is alone in the big city. With his father's money, he books into the Plaza. He must outsmart the suspicious concierge Tim Curry. Then he runs into The Wet Bandits (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) once again.I'm willing to accept the Wet Bandits to return in this sequel. It makes no sense, but that's not the biggest obstacle. The biggest obstacle is the repeat of the first movie. I don't understand why they feel the need to copy. They had a fun setting in the hotel. It would be so much more interesting to have the hijinx there. Kevin pulls a funny fast one on the concierge. The movie needs more of that. Imagine if Kevin had to outsmart all three of them at the same time. That would be a much better sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Two grown-men trying to murder a 10-year old self-development guru,"While the original is rightly considered an all-time classic family film, the sequel is nothing more than a lazy cash-grab. It staggers me that John Hughes could just rewrite the exact same story and think it would be acceptable. The only significant difference from the original is that the main characters become even more slapstick and many scenes are just plain stupid as a result. It's a shame to see great actors like Catherine O'Hara and Joe Pesci reduced to this.Culkin is still very cute and likeable but his character is so unbelievably corny in this movie that it makes some of his scenes painful to watch. Many of his lines feel like they were taken from a cheap self-help book or a fortune cookie. His scenes with Marley in the original were moving and authentic; his scenes with Brenda Fricker aka Pigeon Lady are just forced and contrived. Speaking of Pigeon Lady, surely they could have at least tried to make her resemble an actual homeless person? She looks like a well-fed piano teacher from Surrey.I really wish I hadn't watched this movie; it's such a shame when these dreadful sequels take the gloss off a great film. It's only Culkin who prevents me giving this a basement rating.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good if Unoriginal Sequel,"Home Alone 2 (1992)*** (out of 4)A year after the events in the previous film, 10-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) finds himself alone once again but this time in New York City. It doesn't take long for him to run into Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) who plan on robbing a toy store for some charity cash. It's funny but growing up I always thought HOME ALONE 2 was better than the original but revisiting it after all these years has me changing my mind. I was really surprised to see how this one didn't quite hold up as well as the original and I think a lot of it has to do with some pretty big errors with the screenplay. Needless to say, the main reason for this thing being made was because the first was such a massive hit. You can expect this type of sequel to be pretty much a remake as everything funny in the first film is copied here. This includes the old gangster movie with the gun, the various knocks and beatings taken by the crooks and of course the ""true"" meaning of family. All of that stuff here is still funny but it just doesn't come close to what the original offered. The biggest problem with HOME ALONE 2 is its running time, which is just way too long for this film and after a while you're really wishing that it would hurry up and end. Still, there's no question that Culkin is just wonderful here in the role that he will always be remembered for. Both Pesci and Stern are fun as the bad guys and we get nice support from Catherine O'Hara and John Heard who have to be the worst parents in screen history. Tim Curry is also fun in his small role.",,Anonymous,Crime
Not Great But Watchable,"Home Alone 2 isn't great but it's watchable. I think Tim Curry is who makes this film enjoyable. I like Mr. Duncan the toy store owner as well. Kevin, his family and the 2 wet thieves are about the same as the first film.My problem with the film is not enough interaction between Kevin and the thieves - that's why we watch these movies.Kevin gets himself on the wrong flight - separated at the airport.

Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"Though not quite as much fun as the original, this isn't an half bad follow-up. The beginning is a little too convoluted setting the scene as this time the family go to Florida but a last minute mix-up at the airport sends ""Kevin"" (Macauley Culkin) to New York. Initially a bit apprehensive, he heads - armed with his dad's credit card - straight to the Plaza Hotel where he goes a bit bonkers with the room service and catches the attention of suspicious concierge Tim Curry. Whilst out exploring, the recently released Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern bump into him and decide to exact their revenge - not before telling him of their daring plan to rob a toy store. Of course he escapes their clutches, and quickly decides to try to thwart their thievery - as only he can. Curry is on good form here, as is just about everyone else as the slapstick hits overdrive and the paint pots, a nail gun and even an old cannon find innovative new uses. It is a good team effort, this - with plenty of gentle humour and amusing antics. Maybe just a bit too long, the joke starts to wear a bit thin but Chris Columbus has built well on the first film, with just enough variation from that one whilst essentially keeping the story the same.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Daniel Stern said it best: they repeated everything from the first one.,"When I heard Daniel Stern speak at Lewis and Clark College in September, 2004, he explained that in the case of ""Home Alone"", everything was pretty ridiculous, but at least they only did it once; he affirmed that with the second one, they just repeated everything. He's right. ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" does repeat everything. And is it really appropriate to make various and sundry injuries look funny?

Home Alone 2,"""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" was apparently conceived when Macaulay Calkin said he wouldnt relocate from his NYC home to Chicago. So, whilst the Windy City (and particularly the affluent suburb of Winnetka) appears fleetingly at the start, most of the film's action takes place in the Big Apple, and that is a pretty large canvas for Kevin McAlister to work with when - shock horror - he is separated from his family, getting onto a plane to New York when the rest of the McAlister clan went to Miami, and - shock horror again - Marv and Harry, the Wet Bandits from the first film, escape from prison and find themselves there as well. Of course they run into Kevin, who threatens to ruin their latest plan to make a big buck.Showcasing pretty much every iconic New York City location, Home Alone 2 features plenty of laughs (the hotel 'Angels with Filthy Souls' scene is great), a Donald Trump cameo in the Plaza Hotel, tonnes of comedic violence and, as a counterpoint to said violence, a sentimental ending, all set to a brilliant score from the maestro John Williams.

A Perfect Sequel,"This movie takes everything in the original, and does it better. It takes many of the exact same beats from the first movie, and does them again, which most people seem to dislike, however, I disagree. With the exception of the pigeon lady, (who is pretty good, but really does just feel like a rehash of the shovel guy) all of the repeated elements are done with variation, and are improved in quality. The fake movie in this is funnier than the one in the first, the whole ""I'm a kid and I'll have fun doing irresponsible stuff"" aspect is done better thanks to the setting. And the humor is generally better. Maybe a lot is redone in this movie, but it's a winning formula, who cares? The pacing is also drastically improved. The first Home Alone is good, and I'm not saying that the first chunk of that movie is boring, but even with the comedic and other ways entertaining aspects, it still feels like you're just waiting through the movie to get to the trap sequence. However, in Home Alone 2, it feels like every scene is entertaining, and the trap sequence is just a cherry on top. Speaking of, the trap sequence is really good in this movie too. I don't understand why so many think this is a ""rushed sequel"" when they've presumably watched the whole movie all the way through. What I'm saying is, or, my point is, Marv getting electrocuted is absolutely hilarious and is the best example of slapstick comedy I have ever seen, seriously, rewatch it and tell me this isn't a good sequel.

Hey let's make the exact same movie...AGAIN!!!,"I give this movie the same score as the last movie mainly because it is essentially the same movie only with a new setting. Yes this time most of the action of this film takes place in a New York hotel where our hero can make grown people shiver in fear with old movies that never really existed in the first place and the same two guys are after him for revenge for what he put him through the last movie. The additions to the cast include Tim Curry as a rather arrogant hotel person, and a bag lady who will teach young Kevin (I think that is the brat's name) some sort of lesson though you think he would have learned enough lessons after his last fiasco, but then how would we have the sequel which is obviously one of those sequels they rushed to get made like they did with the ""Look Who's Talking"" first and second movie and when they rushed ""Moonraker"" after ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Batman and Robin"" after ""Batman Forever"". All those examples basically use the same blue print for there movie so you end up with essentially the same movie with a few new moving parts here and there and considering I hated the first one the change in venue did not do anything to make me like this one any more or less.

For crying out loud, they whine about being stuck inside the hotel because of the rain in Florida, yet I hate to tell you this, but snow (which they seem to like) is simply frozen rain. Then, while they're still in Florida, Kevin can get things for himself by simply telling people stupid stories, and out of nowhere he has just what he needs to torture the hotel workers and the criminals.It gets especially bad when he makes the remodeling house of his relatives the center of torture for the same criminals. The scenario is a lot like and maybe even worse than the original movie; he nearly does enough to murder the criminals and things that could possibly destroy the entire house itself.Although I did like the characters like the Pigeon Lady and Mr. Duncan from the toy store, but that was about it. The scenarios with things like Kevin's tricks on the hotel employees (things that would hopefully get police called), alongside his supposed brilliant catch of the criminals using his torture.

A sequel in the vein of Terminator 2,"This is another of those sequels that... suffer(?)... from a not entirely uncommon illness, known as ""The T2 Syndrome"". Terminator 2 may not be the origin of said illness, or even the first film to fall victim of it, but it is commonly accepted as the first recorded case of it. The syndrome renders any sequel as more of a remake of the first than an actual sequel, but the quality is a variable, it can go either way(or nowhere at all). Usually, everything in the film is kicked up a notch, higher production value, more action and more entertainment... sometimes signifying a higher budget. These films are often a desperate attempt by the film-makers to re-create the success of the first without breaking new ground or showing any originality or creativity. For whatever curiosity value it may hold; Charlies Angels: Full Throttle is another victim. As a victim of this illness, the film contains scene after scene(in fact, it's put together by them, it consists entirely of them) that are mild re-writes of scenes from the first. The plot is basically the same, and at best, fairly interesting. The minor lift the film has received in content, the fact that everything is just slightly 'more' than it was in the first makes for a few entertaining scenes scattered throughout the film(good thing, because without them, the film is barely worth watching at all). Apart from the entire original cast(well, the foundation, at least; the McCallister clan is back) returning for this sequel, we are also joined by the comedic talents of Rob Schneider, Tim Curry and Dana Ivey(I know, I know, but think of how she was in the Addams Family films, seriously), which pays off big time. The pacing is fine. The acting is mostly goofy and overplayed, which I suppose is the idea. The humor works, on occasion. There is one thing I just have to say; I don't much mind the silly humor of most of the film, but at the end... when it turns to slap-stick, Looney Tunes-like humor... that was just too much. It was bad in the first, this time, it's worse. I could barely watch. I found myself turning away again and again, taking longer and longer to look back at the screen. The content disgusted me. This is coming from a man who, in the last week, has seen Dawn of the Dead, Saw and Hellraiser: Hellseeker... during which, I never turned away, or, for that matter, regretted that I hadn't. The tone is just too much in this film, during those last scenes. I don't know what disturbs me more; the fact that I, myself, as a child, enjoyed these scenes. The fact that as I write this, there are children enjoying them. Or the fact that there are grown people... not only enjoying watching them, but thinking that it's OK, that it's OK to put that in (children's) films, to tell children that it's OK. That it's responsible. That children may, or even(*shudder*) should think that. It disturbs me. Quite a lot, in fact. That aside, the film does a nice job, through cinematography and dialog, to show the world as seen by a young child... of course, that only makes aforementioned fact even worse. I only recommend this film for people studying films, so they can analyze and debate it, get into the frame of mind behind this film, understand it. Anyone else watching it should take great care to understand that it is, in fact, fiction, and has very, very little to do with reality. I wouldn't consider this proper viewing for kids, unless these are very mature and understand that it's not real. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Let's Run It Back,"My assumption is that they saw the numbers on the first Home Alone and just said, ""Let's run it back,"" like it was a pick up basketball game at the Y. They quite literally change nothing but the location and the scary man was now a scary lady. Everything else was virtually the same with the exception of some small tweaks. They even got up late again and were scurrying out of the house! It was a regular act of laziness on the part of Hollywood. Without even doing any homework I'm guessing it raked in a gajillion dollars--nothing like the first one, but mad money for a sequel. Yes, it was entertaining... for a rerun.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Never mind being Lost in New York, something somewhere got lost in the transition from 1990's functional first outing and the nonentity that is the second.","I'm not sure 1990's Home Alone was crying out for a sequel, nor indeed do I think the first film was produced with that of continuing the misadventures of its young protagonist in mind. Like any scientist experimenting with chemicals and procedure in their laboratory, burrowing away at what it is they do for that elusive formula which will make them famous and, they hope, the world a better place, American director Chris Columbus toyed with this project about a kid stuck at home; his family's mad dash back to him and a pair of crooks looking to rob his mansion of a home before happening upon something with a shelf-life. The first was a sweet enough tale, this idea of a child at home alone after wishing to be as such whilst learning some home-truths about the presence of one's family and, encapsulated in the supposedly serial killing road-sweep, that life beyond one's homely walls was a little different to what one originally thought. Boom! Ideas and chemicals and experimentations forge together to create something audience's respond to, Home Alone being one of the fifteen or so highest grossing films of all time at the time, and thus a sequel is spawned. Cynicism aside, it's important to establish Home Alone 2: Lost in New York exists for the cash and solely for the cash; a filmic formula that was stumbled upon and saw people react.In truth, Home Alone conformed to that of a closed narrative structure; by which we mean his stance on things were introduced, befell a catalyst which allowed him to address his views and then came around to realise that things weren't so bad when you've got the sort of family young Kevin McCallister had and you're living in the environment that you are. The framework was established; developed and then closed and there was no room for further development. Lost in New York takes everything the first instalment did, as well as the places it took its lead, and incinerates them in a blaze of smoke within about fifteen minutes: this time, his reaction to his realising that he's all alone with time to himself away from his family is greeted with a grin rather than a grimace. He is afraid, but only of getting caught.Like number one, it's Christmas time and the greater extent of the McCallister family are going nuts over their annual festive holiday. This time it's Florida, and this time Macaulay Culkin's Kevin makes it as far as the airport departure lounge, in what is an improvement of not even getting out of his bedroom the first time round, but gets mixed up in the rush and lands himself on an airliner to New York. Feeding off what had happened back home in regards to Kevin and his managing to fall out with his family over a practical joke at a school choir pageant, access to his father's credit cards and a wad of existing cash draws him into staying at an expensive hotel and gorging himself on the surroundings rather than turn himself in. First and foremost, New York City dwarfs Kevin; a montage getting across the scale of the place in regards to this overtly street-wise youngster is encapsulated in a tracking shot away from The World Trade Centre as Kevin stands atop it.Alas, a somewhat hackneyed subplot to do with the two burglars from the first one is cooked up; Joe Pesci's Harry and Daniel Stern's Marv have escaped from prison in amidst a riot and have come to New York as if European immigrants at the start of the century seeking opportunity and fresh starts. In direct opposition to his 5-star living in the mean time, however, is chief of the hotel floor Mr. Hector (Curry), whose gurning face is the subject of a dissolve designed to sync up with that of an image of The Grinch on television. Like those aforementioned bandits from the first, he is indeed out to wreck McCallister's Chritsmas cheer upon happening upon Kevin's scheme to live a high life on his father's card and by himself..Complaints with the first film came with its tendency to place most of its eggs in the basket labelled ""final twenty minutes"", when a series of stunts and second unit sequences saw Marv and Harry smacked about by a number of booby-traps Kevin had laid for them. Here, one can practically feel Columbus nudging us in the arm and winking at us square in the face as the realisation the film is about to do what everybody responded to the first time, again. It was marginally fun the first time; here, harmless slapstick has crept up a notch to near full on body-horror: where a paint can on the bonce or a pellet gun round to the groin was once as bad as it got, one cannot help but omit gasps of surprise that Stern's character hasn't already been killed five minutes into the final act. This knowing sense about things only really mattering during these sequences is epitomised in Marv's 'knowing' reactions of ""Uh-oh!"" as something else befalls him - a laughter cue is all that's missing. The somewhat brainless and rather unnecessary sentiment of the whole thing is summarised in the reason for the final act to even happen, that of the fact the criminals have been snapped looting a store thanks to Kevin's Polaroid camera and are desperate not to be incriminated further. For whatever reason, they ditch the successful score and chase him into this dilapidated house of traps having already topped the wanted lists as escaped felons anyway. People say Kevin's intelligence in these films is too ""unrealistic"" for that of a ten year old; but with competition like this, are we all missing something?",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Recycled slapstick that offers little surprises,"Really , in my opinion another sequel that was uneccessary due to the fact that it is not a continuation of a story arc, it is yet another sequel that was made to cash in on the success of the original. Just like with Jaws and the countless other movies that only had sequels because of greed of hollywood.So here we have the same awful McCallister family, they treat Kevin like crap again , his cousins are the most disgusting bunch of mean spirited people even worse than the first movie . And why does the father keep inviting his mooching useless ahole of a brother along , the guy pays for nothing and yells and threatens Kevin at every turn. I mean , the father is paying for not only his own familys trip but his cousins and inlaws. The y are all a bunch of useless mean spitited people who care nothing about anyone but themselves. They insult Kevin ,call him names and at the end of the movie , do they care about Kevin no. Buzz blames Kevin for everyting that happens when it was the familes fault ,I mean after they all get on the place to Florida ,wouldnt they notice that Kevin was not on the plane with the other kids. And for that matter , Buzz causes most of the grief when he gets Kevin in trouble before they even go on the trip. It just makes me sick to watch his family onscreen . The first time I saw this movie ,I was hoping that someone anyone would give Kevins family an earful and tell them what an awful bunch of people they are and punch that deadbeat Uncle in the mouth.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A fun-filled sequel with holiday spirit,"""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" is a delightful sequel that brings back the beloved character of Kevin McCallister, played by Macaulay Culkin. This time, Kevin finds himself accidentally separated from his family and navigating the bustling streets of New York City during the Christmas season.The film retains the charm and humor of the original, with Kevin once again using his wit and resourcefulness to outsmart the bumbling burglars, Harry and Marv, portrayed by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. The iconic duo delivers hilarious performances as they fall prey to Kevin's elaborate and inventive traps.The setting of New York City adds a fresh and exciting backdrop to the story, with Kevin exploring famous landmarks like the Plaza Hotel and Central Park. The festive atmosphere and picturesque locations enhance the holiday spirit of the movie.While the plot follows a similar formula to its predecessor, the sequel manages to inject new energy and memorable moments, making it an entertaining watch for both kids and adults. The supporting cast, including Tim Curry and Brenda Fricker, add to the film's appeal with their standout performances.Overall, ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" is a heartwarming and humorous adventure that captures the magic of the holiday season, making it a worthy follow-up to the original classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Better than the first,"It is one of the most difficult things for a producer and director to make a sequel to a phenomenally successful film, much less do ne better than the first. However, that is exactly what Christopher Columbus and the late John Hughes did with Home Alone 2. Of course, the plot is basically the same as the first film, and most of the time that formula would doom the sequel. But it was the small tweaks they made which made this film memorable in its own right. I think that the most important thing was setting a high spirited and naturally inquisitive and exploration minded boy loose in New York, rather than remaining at home. I don't know if kids still are wired for that kind of adventure, but I was. Thus, when I see the grin on Kevin's face as he looks out over the city I can relate. That was me as a kid. Likewise, there is his sneakiness in taking his father's wallet, and genius in the story he told the hotel desk clerk. Of course, the other hijinks of Kevin are similar to the first film but played well, and who better than Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern to reprise their roles as Kevin's unwitting victims. The other minor characters add something to this film that was not present in the first, mostly as additional foils for Kevin's bag of tricks, especially Tim Curry and Rob Schneider. But, it is Mr. Duncan and Annie, the pigeon lady that bring a the needed touches of kindness that make this a such a holiday classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
excellent,this was almost on par with the first one. it was creative and though it may look like just a repeat of the first one surprisingly in was a completely different plot. this is another great john Hughes movie. it was all about laughs. it was intelligent but yet it was goofy. a decent sequel. very funny. it had good film making quality. though it is very predictable it is very entertaining. it has a little stupid humor which you have to expect from john Hughes and McCully Culkin. like most child films it was slightly immature. kids will love it!!!!!! adults will really like it. it's one to own and watch over and over.

"Not as good as the first, but at least it's a lot better than the other sequels.","My Take: Not as good as the first, but not as bad as they say.Like the first film, I also give this a four-star rating for a job well-done. Director Chris Colombus really shows great talent on producing ideal family films. The laughs are as effective as always and, like the original, it doesn't forget to integrate great family values. This time around, little Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) isn't home alone, he's lost in the Big Apple, and he has his dad's credit card and cash to give him the ultimate vacation, until The Wet Bandits, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), show up, and plots a big Christmas heist.Okay, it isn't very different to or better than its predecessor, but at least it's better than the other two sequels. Because unlike them, the producers don't just shoot the film, they shoot it with the same charm as its predecessor. It's certainly much better than ""Home Alone 3"", with the whole silly plot about the microchip. I haven't seen ""Home Alone 4"" yet, but from what I've read about it, it's definitely awful. So watch the first two most importantly. You can watch the other two, at your own risk.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Uncomfortably brutal and over-the-top sequel,"Rarely has a success-story been as unabashedly copy-pasted as in Home Alone 2. Still, it isn't the lack of creativity that makes this flick almost unwatchable: Where Home Alone balanced on a knife-edge when it came to how Kevin MacAllister downright thrashes the two antagonists, the sequel is brutally over-the-top. The film is jam-packed with violence which is presented with ostensible warmth and joy. It's discomfortable at best. The filmmakers don't seem to realize that the representations are inherently graphical, something the cheerful tone cannot redeem. On the contrary it only makes it worse, because it implies that throwing bricks at people's heads and setting them on fire can be seen as an expression of righteousness. The only things keeping this film remotely watchable are Macaulay Culkin squeezing out the last drops of his childish charm and some segments boasting a fun Tim Curry.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Too much like the original in some points, but still funny","After the surprise hit ""Home Alone"" in 1990 took the world by storm, a sequel was bound to happen.""Home Alone 2"" takes place just two years after the events in the first movie when Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) was accidentally left home alone by his family and relatives because of an argument and later had to deal with two burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) wanting to rob his house before getting arrested. Now in the sequel, Kevin is at it again except this time he's on his way to New York after getting confused during an airline station where he sees another man dressed in the same coat as his father. While Kevin's parents and relatives are worried that the hero is not in their presence, the young boy is in New York having the time of his life from spending his father's money to living in a luxury hotel at the Grand Plaza along with meeting interesting and weird characters from a homeless lady (Brenda Fricker) who feeds pigeons and later becomes his friend; then there's the hotel staff from the sinister Tim Curry as the concierge who has the smile of the Grinch to Rob Schinder as a suck-up bellboy.And if you thought that Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) were in prison...think again. Kevin encounters the two thieves where he finds out that they want to rob a local toy store.Home Alone 2 feels like we're watching the same movie over again but in a new setting. Some of the gags are very funny when Kevin sets up his usual pranks at an abandon apartment complex, but they don't compare to the original.

Oops! They did it again...,"Kevin is lost again, this time not in the house, but in the airport. It's a progress but seriously, what were the odds? Not too low when you consider the premise of a sequel making loads of money and capitalizing on the first opus' popularity.But box-office considerations put aside, what's to think about the film? I guess it all comes down to one thing: someone who loves ""Home Alone"" will appreciate the sequel (subtitled ""Lost in New York"") because it didn't take too much distance from the original format. And someone who disliked the first opus will probably hate this one even more. The other possibility is to appreciate the first for its nostalgic value and while not denying that the second is a 90's comedy classic (as a continuation of the first), it's possible to have a few reservations.""Lost in New York"" reminds me of another sequel: ""Gremlins 2"", the same premise in the Big Apple setting, with little Gizmo as the same heartwarming leitmotif as Christmas in ""Home Alone"". But ""Gremlins 2"" was also notable for its change of tone and pace, compared with the original, too many goofy Gremlins and zany jokes made the film closer to a parody than a direct continuation. I believe ""Home Alone 2"" did the same, it really is over-the-top and goofier than the first (which says a lot) but it also displays an overdose of schmaltz and sappiness and in a weird and sneaky way, it does create some bizarre balance in the end.The problem of ""Home Alone 2"" is that the film is really capable of mocking its own material in a edgy way, but these brilliant moments get drowned in an ocean of syrupy sentimentality and cartoon-like violence. When after losing their black sheep of a kid again, the parents go to the Police, they almost break into laughter when they say ""at least we didn't lose one luggage"", it's funny in a hilarious Simpson-like way because it's like they concede how awful their parenting is and it's so tragic it's actually risible. That was a hilarious moment. But there aren't many unfortunately as John Hughes, who wrote the script, was busier trying to recycle the original plot.That would have been fine of course, especially the premise of a kid like Kevin, again brilliantly played by Macaulay Culkin, to spend some vacation in the most prestigious hotel in New York (and meet future President Trump). And when the staff is composed of Tim Curry, Dana Ivey (and even Rob Schneider) you know it's going to be fun. But there's a fine line between funny and ludicrous that the film crosses too many times even within the screwball universe it got us used to. I have a hard time believing that Curry would mistake an inflatable clown for a man. It's not a matter of contrivance but awkwardness, when the ""old movie"" shtick works again and the man on TV mentions ""Cliff"" and there's a staff member named the same, that's a contrivance that pays off.Another moment of brilliance was the confrontation between the parents and the staff, ""What kind of idiots do you have working here?"" ""The finest in New York City!"" replies Dana Ivey with a triumphant smile in Curry and Schneider's faces, not realizing the joke is on them and when the confrontations ends with a slap on his face, you can almost taste the tear in Curry's eyes. When a writer is capable of such subtly funny moments, you regret that the film followed the same formula as the first and push it to most extreme levels. The best parts are all in the first part of the film, after that, it just goes too far for its own good.I love a Good Christmas story but talk about overplaying it. All right, Kevin has a poignant conversation with a toy store owner who happens to have the same growl than James Stewart, it was so sappy I thought it would be revealed at the end that this guy was Santa Klaus. I understand the toy shop was pivotal to set up the final act and the moment with the kid is in the hospital important to establish that Kevin was mischievous but with a golden heart. Now, did we need that Bird Lady? Brenda Ficker plays ""Shovel Man"" counterpart very well but that exchange about the meaning of heart and all was quite overwritten. I couldn't believe Kevin would say that after what he said to his mother, and before what he did to Harry and Marvin.Speaking of them, yes, they're the bad guys all right, we get it. But they undergo so much pain that I found the confrontation very hard to watch. In the first film, the house tricks lasted less than twenty minutes, it's almost twice longer in the sequel and they get the full treatment: bricks thrown from a hundred feet high, ropes soaked with kerosene, electrocution, and always that annoying sliding before falling on their back. Whoever told Hughes that seeing a man falling on his back was funny, it's cringe-worthy at best and no matter how bad they are, it really plays like a disproportionate retribution.
I know I'm reading too much, but there's another fine line between getting their comeuppance and being victim of a sadistic little brat that the film doesn't cross, it flies over it. Marvin screaming with the spider on his face was funny, seeing him scream in a Hitchcok's ""Birds"" remake was quite painful to watch.""Home Alone 2"" is fun and entertaining but the last part recycles the original's bits by overplaying their effect, sometimes I felt the sentimentality was like the bricks thrown at our face and the violence toward Harry and Marv made me feel more sorry for her than any bird lady or hospital kid.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

He doesn't have a home in New York, so how is he home alone? This could've easily been its own stand alone film if the characters were all different and just be called the film's subtitle ""Lost in New York."" But would it sell as well? Probably not. So bring back the three actors and we have ourselves a sequel.The plot seems to be lifted directly from the original film. Due to a severe mix-up at the airport where Kevin (Culkin) follows a man wearing the same coat as his father, he is taken on a flight to New York instead of with his family who is going to Florida for Christmas. Kevin fearlessly checks himself into a hotel, gets settled in, then realizes the criminals he beat the hell out of (Pesci and Stern) in the first film come back and now have placed him back in their cross-hairs.From there on out the plot becomes more jokes about being hit on the head and running away frantically. I give Macaulay Culkin a boatload of credit for not being one of the childhood actors like the ones on Full House where they spend a lot of their time standing still and looking cute. Culkin provides cute, boyish charm while creating eventful mishaps on screen. Just like in the first film; some antics are funny, some are redundant without being funny.We also get a strange subplot with an old woman who enjoys feeding pigeons. She has been considered the ""old creep"" in town and has been shunned by her peers. That's how Kevin feels with his big family most of the time. Their connection is slim, but acceptable. While at the same time it feels almost contrived and not a very needed subplot. It does rest the tired hit-on-the-head jokes that have been hit over our head, pun intended, during the course of the film.Home Alone 2: Lost in New York provides some nice shots of New York, some decently executed dialog, and delightful cameos like Ally Sheedy, Donald Trump, and, my favorite, Tim Curry. The only downside is you're watching the same film. It still fuels the ""childhood escapism"" tank like I mentioned before, but it does hardly anything new with it. It just rehashes a formula previously seen before. More imagination to the story could've been taken into consideration.Or maybe, just not have a sequel at all. The first was an unexpected success, it did very well in theaters, and is still played repeatedly during the holiday season. The concept of a child being left alone to fend for himself by accident is a possible thing. Unfortunately, the sequel does little to expand the idea except by removing the four walls barricading the kid in the first film and giving him a full city to work with. A lot happens in this two hours. Quite a lot of things. Plausible or not, it's beginning to get very redundant. I suggest parental counseling and a dog leash.Starring: Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, and Daniel Stern. Directed by: Chris Columbus.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Second verse, same as the first","This is a complete rehash of the first film. I enjoyed the first film, but the second one was kinda sad. It uses almost the same script from the first film, and not really any points for originality. You almost feel bad for the cast and crew in this film. Home Alone II is one of the few films to use shameless plugs. The Plaza Hotel is the backdrop for this film and it almost felt like Donald Trump was bankrolling the whole production. Watching Home Alone 2 is like seeing The Harlem Globetrotters more than once: there is always the same gags, but as least the Globetrotters keep there shows fresh. As I said earlier this film has no life and no originality. Still, it didn't matter because the film made mega-bucks and Fox laughed all the way to the bank.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A Christmas treat, as good as the first Home Alone movie","I am not familiar with the original Home Alone, although this sequel is a pleasant family film.The story is basic but with a twist: Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin)is not left home alone for Christmas but manages to get to the airport with his family - only to board the wrong plane and fly to New York City, instead of Florida, where his family has retreated to. Kevin is overjoyed to have the world of New York City as his playground, and checks in the nice Plaza Hotel. However, Kevin is being watched closely by the suspicious hotel clerk (Tim Curry). In addition, the Wet Bandits (Joe Pesci & Daniel Stern) have broken out of prison and coincidentally end up in New York City, planning to rob a major toy store.The humor in this film consists of over-the-top comical violence/slapstick but nonetheless not cruelly inappropriate for a kid's movie. Although the plot sounds like a carbon copy of the original Home Alone, the Christmas/holiday feel makes up for it. John William's score is more developed for this franchise, and more delightful and Disney-like. The setting of New York City and the Plaza hotel is incredible.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Nice sequel...,"""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" is a Comedy movie and the sequel of ""Home Alone"", in which we watch Kevin McCallister being alone in New York City and he has to deal again with the two burglars he faced a few years ago but now he is in a different city and everything is different.Since I had already watched the previous movie I had high expectations from its sequel. I enjoyed it because it had plenty of funny scenes and some hilarious interpretations by its cast. The direction was made again by Chris Columbus as in the first movie and he followed the same successful pattern. The interpretations of Macaulay Culkin who played as Kevin McCallister, Joe Pesci who played as Harry and Daniel Stern who played as Marv were very good for one more time. To sum up, I have to say that ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" is a nice comedy movie to spend your time with but I believe that it did not reach the first movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A sequel-remake that is even better than the original,"I remember so well how much we anticipated this movie. My sister and I watched its predecessor on video everyday for the whole year leading up to the release of this sequel, and we were not disappointed when we finally saw it. We thought it was the funniest movie ever made, because what little kid doesn't want to see other kids get revenge on grown-ups? It seems to me that any kid that says they don't want that in some way shape or form is lying.It's been nearly 30 years since the exciting day we saw Home Alone 2 in theaters, and until yesterday I had not seen it in many years, even though we went through a phase of watching it on video (once it came out) almost as much as we watched the first one. But then, at that age I thought bathroom humor was funny too.
My tastes have changed as I've grown up and I did not have high hopes for watching this movie again. How well could it possibly hold up, now that I've been exposed to so many great filmmakers and the likes of Fellini, Jaglom, Visconti and many others line my favorites list?I was pleasantly surprised. So, so, so pleasantly surprised.Much to my shock, I laughed almost as much as I did back in 1992, and not just at the slapstick. The way Kevin manipulates grown-ups to get what he wants is still hilarious because it is *almost* believable. The scene where he plays a gangster movie to trick the hotel concierge (Tim Curry) was a highlight in particular, especially now that I'm familiar with Curry and his other work. It's much too funny to spoil.Would I have liked it as much if I hadn't had fond memories of seeing it as a kid so many years ago? I really think I would've, because I (unlike many of the critics of the day) remember what it was like to be a kid, but even if I didn't, watching idiots be humiliated is fun for someone of any age. It brings out a sense of justice not only for the kids that are belittled by adults, but for any adult who hates to see morons get the upper hand.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Kevin gets blamed for everything,This movie is so fake. Nobody in Kevin's family sees Kevin's older brother buzz set him up to get in trouble and Kevin's mom just blames him and has no sympathy for her son. I'm starting to believe Kevin is an accident and they didn't go thru with a procedure before she gave birth because of their religious views and family values but the way the movie makes this kind of abuse seem commonplace and expected. Must be a sign of the times. I'm the same age as the actor who played Kevin and I'm convinced my generation is wasted and everyone born after 1990 is totally shot out from growing up in absolute luxury.,1.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""I won't forget you; trust me"" – Kevin McCallister","""I won't forget you; trust me"" – Kevin McCallisterThese are the last words uttered by Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) in HOME ALONE 2 : LOST IN NEWYORK which is also the last movie of the HOME ALONE duo logy. There have been a few more installments following this to add up to the HOME ALONE franchise however none of them starred Macaulay Culkin and the rest of the cast and none of them really did manage to live up to the first two installments. What more is new when it comes to sequels?This time around Kevin is not left behind by his family. Whilst the beginning of the movie is identical to that of the first movie, this time Kevin does manage to get all the way to the Chicago airport with his entire family. However a slight battery included incident separates him from his family and Kevin once again is left behind. His family heads off to Miami while Kevin boards the wrong plane and is flown into the Big Apple; New York. Here in New York Kevin keeps on finding trouble and is reunited with his nemesis the ""Wet Bandits"" (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern)I find that Daniel Stern requires recognition in this article since his contribution towards the humorous aspects of the motion is priceless. It's not certain how Stern found the high pitched scream that he nails on many occasions but that scream is indeed his signature move. Marv (Daniel Stern) and Harry (Joe Pesci) aka ""The Sticky Bandits"" as they call themselves in HOME ALONE: LOST IN NEWYORK bring to the audience the Scrooge and Grinch that we all dislike. Kevin who is ten years old is the Christmas Spirit that sets things straight once again. Macaulay Culkin yet again sails through with confidence for a 10 year old displays talent that may be considered uncanny. It does not take long to fall in love with the little mischievous Kevin as he fends for himself against the sticky bandit saving Christmas once again; this time not for himself but for some very special children.Indeed it is a time for giving and sharing. This is what Chris Columbus works his magic around. The entire family motion picture builds around the message of Christmas although there is very little reference to a Church or Christ. One need not be at home nor be in church or even be an adult to spread the joy and spirit of the season. Intently or unintentionally this core message does seep through during this hilarious festive movie.It took me some time to notice it but did you know that the theme music played in HOME ALONE is very similar to that of the first HARRY POTTER movie? Maybe it is a superstitious belief for Chris Columbus in reaching out for success.A great movie to spend time on this festive season and as Kevin's quote states neither would I forget HOME ALONE.TITLE: HOME ALONE: LOST IN NEW YORK DIRECTED BY: CHRIS COLUMBUS.

A Welcome Repeat,"John Hughes and Chris Columbus respectively return as writer and director for ""Home Alone 2: Lost In New York."" The sequel to 1990's ""Home Alone,"" the film follows the same beats as its predecessors, only this time ten-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) is not left at home, but finds himself wisped off to New York City without his family.In a parental improvement from the first movie, Kevin's mom and dad (Cathrine O'Hara and John Herd) remember to bring their youngest when they go to the airport for another holiday vacation. Rushing through the terminal, though, Kevin gets separated from his family and ends up on the wrong flight. While the rest of the McCallisters head down to Florida, Kevin accidentally flies off to LaGuardia Airport in the Big Apple.Mimicking the first film, once Kevin realizes that he's on his own, he celebrates, traveling all across Manhattan to see the City's greatest sites. Using his Dad's credit card that he conveniently has on him, he checks into the Plaza Hotel, run by a goofy manager portrayed by Tim Curry. Kevin lives the high-life here, ordering room service, renting a limousine, and exploring the city-that-never-sleeps with his signature confidence.The illusion of perfection soon falls apart, however, as returning antagonists Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daneil Stern) bust themselves out of prison and arrive in New York at the same time and place as Kevin. Back on the prowl, the fugitives plot to rob a toy store on Christmas Eve. It is up to Kevin to stop them.In a climax that matches the first film's in terms of hilarious slapstick violence, Kevin lures Harry and Marv to his uncle's abandoned Manhattan brownstone. The boy once again defeats the villains with over-the-top booby traps - some of them very similar to those in the original, and some entirely new.Like those in the original, many of the booby traps should probably leave Harry and Marv paralyzed or dead, but ""Home Alone 2"" demands a suspension of disbelief. Its pretty unlikely to imagine the McCallisters getting on another plane without Kevin, and it is near-impossible that Harry and Marv would run into Kevin in the middle of America's biggest city. However, paralleling ""Home Alone,"" ""Lost In New York"" is told from a kid's perspective where certain actions have diluted consequences. Hughes and Columbus have a knack for capturing this youthful vantage point without pandering, creating something warm and fun for all audiences.Indeed, ""Home Alone 2's"" conclusion is just as heartfelt as ""Home Alone's,"" and its comedy is just as crisp throughout. As essentially a repeat of the first film, it's not winning any originality points; the characters have not grown in any novel way, but they remain fun, the jokes haven't gotten old, and the message is one we can still appreciate.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Better than the original in all departments,"Home Alone was a classic kids film, but like all kids films there are jokes put in there for the benefits of the adults.Home Alone 2 is full of em!  And it's better for it.  Like the first installment the spirt of Christmas is a constantly realised concept throughout, it is nostagic and optimistic without ever being sickly.This time around Uncle Frank is even more sadistic, Harry and Marv are even more stupid, and even the legendary Tim Curry makes an appearance as the consierge worryingly obsessed with ruining the life of an eight year old boy he has never met (whilst he is smooching with Cliff!).For anybody who has visited NYC this film will be even better than it already is.Get the fire on, have some cookies and ice cream, and enjoy a magical little film. 5/10""Don't worry Harry...I'LL get him!""",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Better Than the First,"As a general rule, sequels are supposed to expand the universe of the original film and up the stakes, making everything bigger and flashier. Home Alone 2 does just that even if the story is overly familiar. In fact, it's the exact same story. Instead of Kevin's family leaving him at home this time, they leave him on the wrong flight and he ends up in New York while they end up in Florida. In a bizarre and improbable twist of fate, he catches the eye of Harry and Marv who decide to get revenge on him for what happened in the previous film.It's clear that this movie was fast-tracked into production without enough time to really ask why this film was necessary. After all, the idea of someone's parents leaving their child once is horrifying enough, but after this second time, it makes you want to have the police get involved and take all their children away from them.The originality might be non-existent, but the cast is on fire, the jokes are funny, and everything that was lovable about the first film has been exaggerated times 100.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Only Decent Sequel,"We can criticize Home Alone for so many reboots that feel no charm to the original, but I can say that this is the only decent sequel. Home Alone 2: Lost In New York is the only sequel that feels faithful to the original and pretty enjoyable. Yeah, it does have the same plot of the first film with the same gimmicks. But it does bring out charm from the predecessor with and some clever and entertaining traps for the final act, great shots that gives a presentation of a New York City, characters that still have memorable personalities, and some new perspective of Kevin learning responsibility. I know fans of the first movie will probably like this. But keep in mind that again, this is going to be the same plot. So I will just give you a heads up on that if you're ever going to watch it. None of the sequels like this one will top the original, but at least this is the only one I can take compare to all the other stupid sequels/reboots that are made.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
An insult,"I've always loved the first HOME ALONE film, ever since I was a kid, but I deliberately put off seeing this sequel after reading the negative reviews back in the day. Watching it now, as an adult, I can see what the reviewers meant: this is an insult, or indeed a kick in the teeth, to anyone who loves the first film.Given that the original movie was a smash hit, it was inevitably that a rushed-out sequel would quickly follow. And rushed out is right; this is a mere remake of the first film, albeit with a different setting (and nobody gets ""lost"" either, despite the title). The characters are all exactly the same, the gags are the same, everything's the same. A bigger budget doesn't mean improved quality; it means that everyone was in this to grab more dollars.It feels exactly like director Chris Columbus and writer John Hughes are going through the motions here. The bumbling villains are back and have even more ridiculous motives than previously. The crazy pigeon lady replaces the crazy old guy. Even the same TV gag is played out again. Hell, even the climax takes place in a house again, so the whole New York setting turns out to be a cheat. The whole sub-plot with the stressed out parents really drags things down a lot too.HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK isn't a total loss as a film, even though it's a crushing disappointment. It's hard to dislike Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, two actors giving such physical performances. Tim Curry is a fun addition to the cast too. But Macaulay Culkin's self-knowing, superior attitude is becoming annoying already (and, indeed, his Hollywood star was to quickly wane after this) and there's absolutely nothing here that hasn't been done better previously. It's a real disappointment.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not at Home,"I don't admire Chris Columbus.  His work is always targeted towards the kid market, I know, but he does it in the crudest technique possible.

I'm disappointed that John Hughes would abandon his flair from the 80s for this franchise.Consider these 'Home Alone' movies as juvenile versions of 'Die Hard' in the barest sense.  Lone charismatic hero takes on dim-witted villains in tight quarters without backup.Today this plot seems unthinkable with the new airline regulations.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",,Anonymous,Crime

Its a good sequal,"This is the second installment of the hit movie 'Home Alone'. We meet again Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) with his family preparing for their annual trip. While in the airport, Kevin looses his family and ends up on a flight to the wrong destination, New York. There he goes on his own adventure, and reunites with some old ""friends"".Personally, I grew up with this film, and as funny as I have found it as a kid, rewatching it now hit me just the same. Like the first film, Kevin is taught a lesson about life. Being thankful of what you have, be modest and be careful what you wish for. With this first and foremost being a kids movie, I think the writers achieved sending a message to the children watching, while still having a good time.The film captures the beauty of New York in its prime. Lit up with Christmas lights and covered in snow, you really wish you were there. The score remains like the first film which gives this reassuring nostalgic feeling. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stren reclaim their roles as the ''Wet Bandits'' Harry and Marv, and they are just terrific. Perfectly casted. It is refreshing to see Joe Pesci play a funny character for a change, being used to see him as a gangster in a Scorsese film. Also, you have these big names guest star here, which is fun to watch.Overall, this film does what it needs to do.

Bringing so many of the original family members and original cast back was fantastic too. There were some good one liners and Culkin versus the thieves are always fun and hilarious sequences; however, they did use too many of the same themes again - replacing the shovel guy from movie 1 with the pigeon lady in movie 2, same thieves with same hijinks, and Culkin drawing up the same blueprints/plans this time in a toy store instead of a house seemed like lazy writing.Overall this is still a fun and entertaining picture just a huge step down from the first film.

"The Sequal is Great, and delivers the same charm as the first","Good film, liked the Maccalister family and the dynamic was Improved in the second film, the sequal still is great and offers a fresh outcome that delivers on alot. The stakes are also Improved, with the setting being in New York.The setting is actually better because the location is beutiful. All of the guest stars are amazing again, the acting is phenomenonal and especially Tim Curry who is the owner of the Hotel. And the story delivers some more laughs then before. I can agree that it Improves in some areas like the Traps and other aspects like the family, still having that natural aspect to it, and it is still charming.Stern and Pesci are still great villains that are able to show more and pull of more of there tricks here, the Traps are wild and they do take a nasty beating, and they give great performances ounce again, and they look like they are having a wonderful time.Caulkin is also doing some Career best work at such a young age, he really is still the Charming character of Kevin. The believability is slightly lessered here, any why the first got the character-depth right, here it's still good, as he is finding his feet into the world. And he still enjoys the things he did. But he is more angsty here, and can do alot more. Which might make sense given his experience in the first, but the stubbornness and other things such as his ability to cope in situations is slightly lessered as well, as he gets scared easily about the lady, but in the first when he's scared of the man, he then learns more about him. I feel like the same happens here. And for me, they should of shown a more calmer and collected kid, showing that what he's been through, showing he could cope more.I just think he should understand more, but it still is a cheerful Christmas film, it still delivers on the emotional beats, and has some of the same impact, I just think his Journey could've been slightly deeper.

However, this time Kevin's stuck in the unfamiliar evironment of New York City and yet still somehow manages to run into the same people who tried to burgle his family home two years ago - Harry and Marv, The Wet Bandits.Although not as smart or original as the first Home Alone, I actually prefer watching Home Alone 2. It might be because I haven't seen it AS often as the original, or because Macaulay Culkin has actually developed better acting skills... or the scale of the film is bigger, but, for whatever reason, it's engaging to me. The violence is raised a notch and its so comically unrealistic I did actually giggle a few times. Daniel Stern is a very underated physical actor and steals the limelight from Joe Pesci. Tim Curry joins the cast which is nice because I'm a big fan of his and so does Rob Schneider, who is a bit of a guilty pleasure actor/comedian for me.Final Verdict: Slightly better than the original for me, possibly because I've seen it less so it still holds some intrigue. It's a bit more dark, a bit more violent, a bit more everything really.

Strike while the swinging iron's hot, I suppose, and while the child star can still pass for a nine-year-old. It's basically the first film all over again, with a few negligible tweaks to satisfy convention, less emphasis on the errant family (Catherine O'Hara is now officially the worst mother in America, no need to dwell on it) and a renewed sense of brutality in all the scoundrel-punishing booby traps. Rather than scarred for life, just about every one of these pitfalls would leave poor Harry and Marv pushing daisies. It's a weird level-up for a family movie, downright mean-spirited at times, but that particular brand of action is saved for the closing twenty minutes and almost entirely self-contained.The rest of the running time is rehash central, with repeat gags and plot points played over a different backdrop, plus the added bonus of Tim Curry and Rob Schneider as a pair of bumbling, high-class hotel clerks. In the end, Home Alone 2 is nothing magical, just a transparent sequel with enough influential industry minds behind it to avoid being sent straight to VHS.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

A decent sequel,"This movie, about Kevin who accidentally finds himself stranded in New York City, is a decent continuation of Home Alone (1990). It was great to see the same characters with the same personalities that brought you a good amount of good humor, as expected. The story is alright. It's nothing new, but it's probably meant as a ""reboot"" of the first movie, but in different places with some changes. The pace is good, and the script is decent, which makes the movie exciting.

I think this movie does not deserve the rating it has been given, the John Williams score is worth 7 points alone. The movie has also some magic moments, more-than-just-funny performances by the ""Wet Bandits"" and, most importantly (a hint for the makers of Home Alone 3) IT STICKS TO THE VALUES OF THE FIRST MOVIE!!!

This adds some actors to it while bringing back the Wet Bandits (or burglars or whatever Joe Pesci and one called themselves) - one of them being Tim Curry. He is really good - and he is even able to pull off the most ridiculous things off. Like the shower scene - it shouldn't work on so many levels and still because of Curry, there is some fun in there. You also have ""Deuce Bigalow"" in here himself - well I reckon he was not as famous back then, but he is doing his usual stuff, so there is that.A lot of convenient humor, a lot of explaining that still doesn't make sense and apparently a lot of people who just let things slide and are full of forgiveness for all the flaws the movie has ... good for you if you liked this too, like you did the first one.

Excellent Christmas flick!,"HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK, to me, is an excellent Christmas flick. In my opinion, the traps that Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) set for Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) were even more hilarious than the first. They were also more dangerous, but not that much more dangerous. I mean, Kevin set two of the same traps that he did in the first HOME ALONE. Personally, I thought that the Plaza Hotel was, indeed, luxurious and spacious. When and if I go to New York City, I'm going to stay there, even though I know it's expensive. If there were two bumbling burglars were after me, I would be really scared. The one thing that really amazed me was that Kevin got around New York City all by himself without getting hurt. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent Christmas flick to all you Macaulay Culkin fans who have not seen it. When you see it, prepare to laugh and enjoy yourselves.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Surprisingly superior sequel,"Can a sequel ever be as good as the original? In this case yes. Home alone 2 made me laugh harder and louder than the original. The opening of Home Alone 2 was near identical to the original, but it was designed that way to harmlessly mock the former film and make us remembered why we loved it in the first place. However the film has changed location and this time Kevin is lost in New York. In a new and huge city, Kevin's adventures get even better. It was less of Kevin wandering around the house and more him exploring the world and it led to some very funny scenes in the Plaza, the hotel he's decided to check himself into. Acting-wise, I still don't think that his family improved. Luckily they seemed to be in the film less this time so they were bearable. Culkin again was fantastic in his comedy scenes, not so much in sad scenes. The pigeon lady was great and the return of the 'wet bandits' was fantastic. They were just as comedic the second time round, if not even more so. The tricks Kevin pulls on the bandits were even more amusing this time round and led to a lot of laughing out loud. They were much more inventive and the actors played their parts superbly. Such an enjoyable film, that dare I say it; I think I enjoyed the sequel more than the original.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Almost as Good as the Original,"A clever, sweet, and wonderfully done sequel- Home Alone 2 keeps the spirit of the first film alive with an incredibly heartwarming message, and plenty of gags to keep anyone entertained. When I was little, there was no better movie for me to watch than Home Alone 2. It didn't matter what time of year it was, it was just so much fun to watch, and I can still see why that was the case. Although I don't enjoy it as much as I did in the first grade, the film is very entertaining, and full of many laughable moments throughout. The performances are just as good as before for the most part, I feel Daniel Stern overdid it a bit with his performance this time around, though I did enjoy the supporting performances from Tim Curry as the Hotel Manager and Eddie Bracken as Mr. Duncan. The film does have a few plot holes throughout, or things that just seem a bit too forced or out of place, but luckily it makes up for it with its heartwarming ending, which is still one of my favorite conclusions to a Holiday film today. In the end, Home Alone 2 is an enjoyable little family comedy that has its issues, but proves to move far above its problems to make for yet another round of holiday cheer.My Rating: 9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Just another cheesy cliche film,"This is yet another cliche movie where it's played everywhere in the world during Christmas. Most of movie sequels disappoint and this is no exception regarding that fact. The plot is no different than the first movie. It's unoriginal and just an attempt to milk as much as profit possible from the franchise.The characters show no development during the whole movie. They're dull as ever. Most of the characters that's been in the first movie make an appearance. Like why tho? I don't care about what happened to them or what they've become. All i wanted to was just to come across a meaningful character with decent development and the only character coming close to that is the Pigeon Lady.The overall plot repeats itself over and over to the point I've come to predict the events.

Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is a surprisingly fun prequel to one of my favourite Christmas films of all time. It's nearly as entertaining as the first one, and the comedy hits the mark, for the most part. While it isn't quite as charming and enjoyable as it's predecessor, it's still a great holiday movie for the entire family.What amazed me the most was how similar this one and its prequel were. In fact, they are the same film from start to finish, apart from a few cosmetic changes. The McCallister house is changed to New York, the neighbour is swapped to the pigeon lady, and instead of being forgotten, Kevin finds himself on the wrong flight. If it weren't for these changes, I probably would've thought that I was watching the same film. But as the saying goes, 'why fix it if it ain't broke?'. The formula in the original film worked wonders, and it's no surprise that it was attempted to be recreated. While I do admire the audacity to create an almost perfect copy, unfortunately, it doesn't work nearly as well as the first one. This second instalment lacks a lot of the charm that the original Home Alone had, and while New York is a great set, for the most part, the final battle in what is a dark and dirty construction site, feels wrong.The story, while almost the same as before, takes us once again on a holiday journey with Kevin. This time, instead of being left behind, he accidentally ends up on a flight to New York, while the rest of his family is headed for Florida. Having his dad's credit card and the Big Apple at his disposal, Kevin, of course, has the time of his life. However, the infamous burglar duo of Harry and Marv have escaped prison and find themselves in New York as well. Epic chases and chaos ensue, as it all culminates to another iconic battle between the burglars and Kevin. What's more, although Kevin enjoys his freedom, he quickly realizes that there's no place he'd rather be than with his family, just like previously.
While I'm sure that some might mind the almost perfectly recreated story, I didn't find it problematic. However, what bothered me quite a bit was how different the film felt. The first one is full of charm and has a wonderfully Christmasy feel. Since it takes place mainly at the McCallister house, it also has a pleasantly cosy feeling to it. Home Alone 2, however, ditches the simple and homey setting for the grandeur that is New York. But it's not just the venue change that bothered me. Most of the Christmasy elements have disappeared as well, and while it doesn't make the movie any worse in and of itself, I missed that holiday mood since this is a holiday film.Something else that wasn't quite as good as in the first one was the humour. Harry and Marv are still the driving force behind the laughs throughout the movie, and especially at the end. However, while the first film kept their reactions and lines to a perfect amount of over the top, Home Alone 2 takes it a tad too far. This is particularly notable in the battle sequence between them and Kevin. While I stilled laughed quite a lot, the reactions that Harry and Marv give to being brutalized by Kevin's traps felt more forced and lacked an honest feel. A lot of the humour also comes from references to the previous film. While it's a cheap and easy way to do it, I can't deny that I did find a lot of them quite funny.While copying the first film gave a tried and true formula to follow, it also created a lot of pressure. The first Home Alone, while extremely simple, felt easygoing and natural. Home Alone 2, on the other hand, feels like it's trying very hard to reach the wonder of the first one, and unfortunately, it shows. A lot of the lightheartedness that made the first one such an enjoyable time is missing. Instead of just doing its thing, Home Alone 2 is constantly trying to one-up its predecessor and mostly failing at it.With all that being said, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is still a tremendously entertaining and easily enjoyable film. While it never reaches the heights that the first film in the series did, it does get a lot of things right. It's funny and action-packed while managing to be heartwarming and emotional as well. Its biggest problem, and one that it will never overcome, is being compared to the superior in every way prequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The same jokes are still funny,"Kevin McCallister gets separated from his family once again at Christmas.This sequel copies the exact formula that made the original successful and applies it to a different location. Even some of the same jokes are delivered practically word for word. This all sounds bad, but to be fair it still works.The concept of him stranded again isn't quite as plausible as the first movie's idea but it just about sells it. Not that this really matters the second time round because I enjoyed it so much the first time I just want to see Kevin survive in the big wide world again and take on Harry and Marv.The slapstick is taken up another danger level with the absolute torture the hapless housebreakers have to endure this time. It's way over the top but I suppose that's what has to be done with sequels.All performances are excellent from the returning cast and this time we have the added amusement provided by Tim Curry, Rob Schneider and ironically Donald Trump of all people in a 'blink and you'll miss him cameo.It doesn't have the same impact as the original for obvious reasons but it's an entertaining sequel and brilliant for children.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The most Scorsese-like of movies Scorsese never made,"What is this? A story set in New York, check. Graphic violence, check. Joe Pesci, check. The only way we know that Martin Scorsese wasn't the secret producer/director of this film is that Robert De Niro wasn't in it.Anyway, this sequel copies far too many story beats from the original-just as egregious as the Force Awakens in that regard-but it still gets by from being quite funny. (Especially during the hotel scenes). It's also far more violent than the original; not only do we get the infamous four-story free-fall bricks to the head scene, but there are also staple guns, jumper cables, explosions, and more, accompanied by enough bodies crashing to the ground to rival Brian de Palma. It's still funny, though dark in a way only 80s/90s movies could be.Side Note: Hilarious that Trump shows up, and since this is a movie set in 90s New York, how could he not? Of course, the liberals are so horrified that they are trying to censor him out of it, which I think is absolutely infantile. I watch movies all the time made by and starring people I don't politically agree with, and I don't care because I am actually an adult.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"Home Alone 2 picks up a year after the original film in which the McCallister family accidentally left young Kevin alone to battle two criminals at Christmastime. It's Christmas again, and the family have planned another vacation. They don't leave Kevin home alone this time. A mix up at the airport sends the family to France and Kevin to New York...ALONE! Luckily for Kevin, he has his father's credit card which he uses to check himself into the luxurious Grand Hotel. From that point on, Kevin must battle the hotel management staff who believe he stole the credit card he used, as well as a return from the Wet Bandits! Harry and Marv are back and Kevin has a whole new set of tricks and traps that batter the crooks yet again.I really like Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, it matches up pretty well to the first film. Macaulay Culkin does his thing as Kevin, the little boy who finds inner strength during moments of terror. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are hilarious again as the bumbling idiot criminals. O'Hara and Heard are back as the parents who have some funny moments as well, and Tim Curry/Rob Schneider/Dana Ivey add much to the film as the hotel staff. The abundance of characters really works for this movie, they each add an important part to it. Home Alone 2 obviously breaks away from the ""home alone"" idea. Kevin isn't at home he is in a giant city. There is however a good chunk of film time spent at an abandoned house in which Kevin sets up his attack against the 'Wet Bandits'.Home Alone 2 should be seen by everyone in my opinion. It isn't your average Christmas movie, but it does take place at that time in New York City. There are some great location shots at Rockefeller Centre and Central Park. There are also many heartwarming moments between Kevin and a homeless woman he meets in the park. I liked it a lot!8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

They get everything together but seem to lose their son yet again and this time in New York.

The New York setting makes the movie seem a little fresher than just having everything over again but at the same time they decided to beef up on the whole slapstick portion making the movie much more of a slapstick film than the first one. The music and characterization of the other actors is still fairly good and the movie still has a nice warm Christmas film. This one, however, still leaves you feeling like you're watching a warner brothers film and after seeing this one you really don't want to see any more. Thus we end the Home alone experience.

As dreadful as the first film was brilliant,"Home Alone was brilliant, an absolute classic, suitable for the entire family.This was absolutely dreadful and suitable for 15 year olds and little else.Home Alone retained elements of realism and you always felt that Kevin's sole intention was protecting his home. Nothing more than that and the traps were amusing ones.In Home Alone 2, every stunt, trick or booby trap (be it Kevin or Harry) bordered on either the absurd or the sadistic. Add to that the entire airport episode was too nonsensical to take seriously.Rolling some marbles to cause two men to fall in the street you can laugh off & ignore once, but they were numerous. Hurling bricks from a top of a building at somebody, setting fire to them, filling toilets up with petrol, wasn't funny, was a little uncomfortable to watch with children, who equally found no fun in it at all.You could make a decent argument that Kevin was actually the sadistic one in this film & could quite easily have shopped them to the Police instead of luring them to the house.Then they'd have been no film, which in hindsight would've been a blessing.I'll stick with the original from now on, which was immaculately written in the main, rather watch that twice in a row than this again.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Who'd want to go to Florida for Christmas???,"Home Alone 2: Lost In New York (1992) -Once again poor Kevin (Macauley Culkin) was the victim of bad parenting and a bullying Brother. I honestly think that Social Services should have got involved. Kate (Catherine O'Hara) and Peter McCallister (John Heard) obviously had at least one kid too many and as my Nan would have said ""Kate should have kept two legs in one stocking!"". I personally don't think that Kevin had anything to apologise for after the school performance at the beginning, as it was clear who the problem was.In fact the more I watch these 2 films, the more I have realised that Kevin was actually a sweet, witty, clever and insightful child, who was just a victim of bad circumstances and craved attention from parents that had no time for him, which lead him to be a bit of a bugger at times.In this second chapter of the Kevin McCallister saga, he was cast adrift in New York and you'd think that would mean a change in the storyline, but that was not the case and I think that it was a perfectly good way to do things and that the repetitive and recycled elements were what made the film brilliant, without actually being repetitive. It had my favourite things from the previous film, but all with a slight twist or change and much less of Kate's journey to find her son, which could have been the more boring element done twice.Instead, Kevin found new enemies in the hotel staff, played by Tim Curry, Rob Schneider and Dana Ivey and allies in Mr. Duncan (Eddie Bracken), a toy shop owner and Piers Morgan in the role of the misunderstood, but helpful pigeon lady, as he donned a poop covered old lady outfit. It was another of those things that showed Kevin's more adorable side, in the same way that he realised that 'Old Man Marley' wasn't really such a terrible man in 'Home Alone' (1990). (Actually the bird lady was superbly played by Brenda Fricker of course and I have to feel sorry for the poor lady for getting compared to Piers, which must be really offensive for her.)The wet bandits were also back and as stupid as ever, if not more so. Marv (Daniel Stern) had renamed them the sticky bandits, because leaving the taps running last time didn't work out so well for them and he had a new sticky tape thing going on. They chased Kevin down to get back at him for what he had done to them the previous Christmas, while attempting to rob Mr. Duncan's toy shop, which Kevin was having none of and therefore created another maze of chaos and danger for the bandits to endure in his Uncle Rob's house, which was under renovation and empty. I just hoped that Uncle Rob had some very good insurance.I was pretty convinced that the bungling burglars should have been dead from the injuries inflicted upon them by Kev, but it was all done for fun and entertainment, so as long as you don't think too hard about it, you'll be fine.Personally I thought that the real criminals were the staff at the Plaza. They were a prime example of people always looking for the worst and not considering that the youngest McCallister might have just been a frightened child in need of help.You could easily watch this without seeing the first and still enjoy it, but it definitely worked better as a sequel making the most out of the repeated jokes.Overall it was bloody good fun and there was probably a moral in there somewhere too?9.49.81/1000.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Angels with Even Filthier Souls,"I revisited this not-so-good sequel because of recent talk of censoring a certain cameo in it. IMDb is quite cesnsorious itself, having rejected three prior versions of this review, so I won't talk about that here.Unfortunately, the returning cast are caricatures, too, of their roles in the original ""Home Alone"" (1990), recycling just about everything for the sequel--Culkin's raised eye brows instead of winking at the camera, his enjoying his fulfilled wish for a while before whining over his missing family, making friends with scary old people, and even including a sequel to the film-within-the-film, ""Angels with Even Filthier Souls""--but turning up the excess to the point that it's hardly funny anymore. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern's criminals going through the same booby traps in a McCallister home that they did last time becomes an eye-rolling Looney Tunes affair, not only with Pesci's mumbling replacing cursing, but also receiving violence as though they were cartoon characters. Where's the sadistic pleasure in it if the bricks to the head, electrocutions and heads set on fire don't seem real in the slightest.Even worse is the increased family Christmas schmaltz and the blatant product placement, from the Plaza Hotel and Coca-Cola to the Talkboys they sold from this. Outside of Culkin, Pesci and Stern, the rest of the cast is an entire bore this time around--the otherwise wonderful Catherine O'Hara included. They don't even bother to be consistent with how many years it's been since the last time the McCallisters abandoned one of their children, as the parents say it was last year, but Kevin was eight then and now he says he's ten. Whether you're a censor or a spectator, best to leave this one alone.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

Poor,"In the film after this, perhaps little Kevin has been taken away from his ridiculously negligent parents by Child Protective Services. Or maybe he's grown up and is now a serial killer, luring people into his house of horror and sadistically torturing them.There's not a lot of cleverness to be found in this sequel, which recycles the material from the first film to cash in on its success. The script is weak, and between the sappy and precocious lines Macaulay Culkin utters and the moronic behavior from nearly every adult, the film gets lame pretty quickly. That leaves the slapstick, which is entertaining to some extent, but the violence is excessive for a feel-good Christmas/family film, even if it is modelled after the old Looney Tunes cartoons. Somehow seeing a kid hurl bricks off the roof of a building and hit a guy in the face, or turn up the voltage while he's electrocuting someone, was just less funny with real people, and those are only a couple of the moments.The film is bloated at two hours, and just feels incredibly dopey to me - all of these characters and how they act, the manipulation with the pigeon lady and the mother's redemption, the fact that there is nothing original going on, and the har-har look at all the ways we can torture Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern's characters. Obviously it's not meant to be taken seriously but I groaned when the mother got sanctimonious with the hotel staff and the police about her child's disappearance, without a shred of self-awareness. The film is watchable in the right company to laugh along at how bad it is, and I didn't despise it or anything, but it is a little depressing that this mediocre Hollywood cash grab was so successful.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
a good sequel i've seen for the first time,"There aren't very many sequels I've seen but enjoyed. This is probably my most favorite sequel in the world. It's just as good as the first. Mac stars as Kevin again in this super-silly sequel, but lands in NYC. As soon as his family finds out he's missing, they do everything to find him. But he has a blast in NYC. But he uses his dad's credit card and Harry and Marv (from the first) and follow him everywhere he goes. Then he does the same thing in the first, but only at his Uncle Rob's. This is a good sequel. But just don't watch the 3rd. It sucks. This film made more cash than the first. But they're both good no matter what. So if you don't own it, rent it, watch it, enjoy it and if you love it, own it. The more Mac, the merrier.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Same as the first? Sure, but who cares!?","Okay, so this is pretty much a repeat of Home Alone, but that begs the question, how on earth did it make me laugh so much? The slapstick of Harry and Marv is nothing short of genius, and Kevin is as ingenious as ever. I know that it's cheesy, and I know that slapstick isn't everyone's cup of tea, but come on, just enjoy it for what it is - brilliant and silly comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Lost in New York indeed!,"I enjoyed the first movie a lot. Probably one of my favourite comedies ever along with Madagascar trilogy and Back to the future! Of course, with every successful movie, a sequel must come. Perhaps, now Home alone has 5 sequels, but only this one starts the star from the previous movie Maculay Culkin!The plot is similar to the first one: It's Christmas once again, Kevin messes up, he gets grounded, and he (almost) gets forgotten by the family. In the airport, Kevin accidentally gets himself in a different plane that flies to a city that never sleeps - New York! Why? Because he really enjoyed his new gift - a sound recorder so much, that he didn't realise that he's in the wrong plane. And his family panics again. Also Harry and Marv return to steal stuff once again.Although the plot is similar to the first one with some differences, you can't deny that it's as laugh out loud as it's predecessor. Most actors return including Joe Pesci (Harry), Daniel Stern (Marv), Catherine O'Hara (Mrs McAllister), Devin Ratray (Buzz) and more. But new actors are here too, including Brenda Fricker (the pigeon lady) and even Donald Trump is in this as a brief cameo (at least in the old copies, I don't know whether this scene is cut from the newer versions or not).The humour is well made like last time, Kevin will throw something on the thiefs or scream in a funny way when he sees something scary or even trick the hotel staff into thinking that there's a crime scene by using an old cassette of a sequel called ""Angels with even filthier souls"". New York itself looks like a huge city with skyscrapers, stores and a large plaza hotel, although in 2021 it looks different from early 1990s counterpart.If you enjoyed the first movie, then you should 100% watch the sequel. Definitely worth a watch, especially on a Christmas or new year day.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Bigger and better,"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is a prime example of a sequel that's just the first one again. Narratively everything is carried across and the same plot, jokes and characters are recycled with the main difference being the new location and how much bigger it is in classic sequel fashion. However, the change in location works wonders as it allows it to do a lot more as it has a city of ideas at its disposal.Macaulay Culkin leads the film with the same lovable presence as before. Even as he goes on an almost identical journey as last time, he makes it funny and heartwarming throughout. The increased torture Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are put through gives them plenty of opportunities to showcase their painfully funny expressions and whaling. Brenda Fricker and Tim Curry are wonderful new inclusions who enhance the humour and heart.Director Chris Colombus maintains the warmth whilst also showing the darker side of New York in a kid friendly fashion. Once again the slapstick heavy finale is the best part with some seriously impressive stunt work on display and the overall cartoonishness has been dialled up further for even bigger laughs. The score by John Williams and all the songs, especially the one made for this film, still bring such a lovely festive feeling to proceedings.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

This I would say was funny but not as funny as the first one because it is the same stuff and the action gets lamer. I personally like the Home Alone movies because they are hilarious and violent. If people think it's very violent then ask my parents what it is because they know violence. Yet They like this movie so it isn't bad. Now yes I wouldn't recommend this to people who don't like violence because it does contain a little bit of violence. It does not contain enough action so it is not as good as the first one. Also the acting isn't as superior as to the first one. Overall it is a so-so movie,5.0,Anonymous,Crime
And again an unsuccessful robbery or the Little Prankster: part two,"Comedy. A direct continuation of the mega successful ""Home Alone"", which turned out to be no worse than the original, but rather better in many ways. Well, of course, I watched this picture on TV, and for the sake of this review with pleasure I reviewed it again. Since there are three days left before the New Year, so I am properly charged with a festive mood, and here is my brief opinion - And again an unsuccessful robbery. There were both pros and cons in the picture, and now your humble servant will tell you about them. Uncover the comments and prepare the habits, well, fasten your seat belts, our train started.
So the pros:
1. Script - the picture is again focused on Kevin McCallister, who again managed to lose his family. While the others flew to Florida, Kevin himself, by mistake, ended up in New York. Not only did he find himself in a huge metropolis, our old acquaintances, the thieves Harry and Marvin, also fled from places not so distant. We are again waiting for a truly epic confrontation between a petty prankster and two boobies. Re-experiences of parents, especially mothers. Fun adventures and a touching ending. Again washing away family relationships, a brief joy of loneliness and incredible melancholy from realization. The script is still simple and family friendly. It contains important and eternal values, without which a happy life is impossible.
2. Festive atmosphere - pre-Christmas New York is beautiful, I say without irony (I even wanted to go there). Christmas trees, gifts, songs, hopes, fun - all of this is in stock and works great. Well, the music of John Williams, diluted with the famous Christmas hits, without which this holiday is very difficult to imagine.
3. Humor - I'll say terrible - I liked everything, absolutely all the jokes terribly! Moreover, even the antics of some minor heroes did not disgust me. For a second, Tim Curry (General Secretary from the game Red Allert 3) and Rob Schneider are available here. But the cherry on top of that cake for me is Kevin's traps, especially with the gas burner. I urged so that I had to come to my senses after that. The humor here is not strained, but more elaborate than in the first part. In short, if you want to laugh heartily, then look at this particular, second part, because here it is much better with this. There is not even vulgarity, in contrast to the first part.
4. Behavior of thieves - here they are not at all annoying with their mischief Again, the whole point is in the scenario, which was clearly worked out. Their behavior is more natural and does not cause attacks of ""Spanish"" shame. They act more harmoniously, albeit according to a well-established scheme.
So the cons:
1. Traps are not all, but many are deadly. Of course, this is offset by such an unreality of tricks and tricks, but if you look meticulously, then the thieves, after falling into a couple of such traps, the horses would move with one hundred percent probability.
2. Kevin's brain - judging by the first and second parts, Kevin is a living embodiment of Newton, Einstein, Kulibin, Korolev, Archimedes and so on, for he invents and makes traps with the imagination of John Kramer. How he does it? He's less than ten years old, isn't he? Is he a child prodigy or what? This is a cant of both the first and second parts.
3. Thieves are substituted for traps - as in the first part, here the thieves are obviously willing to go straight into the traps, without any ulterior motive. Eh! Life has not taught anything! However, this time it looks more convincing and even without replaying the majority of the participants.
A little about the main characters:
1. Kevin McCallister performed by Macaulay Culkin - old Kevin was again alone, this time in a metropolis, and then it started. Kevin here is not who he was before. Now this is a cunning fox, capable of giving a bite to the goofs who did not understand anything the last time. This is a brave and determined boy, although sometimes he is cowardly, but only at the beginning. Macaulay played great here. Even without replaying it was possible! Well done!
2. Harry, played by Joe Pesci, is the leader of the thieves' duo, who planned a big deal, until, unfortunately, they met the culprit of their troubles - the boy Kevin. It's time to deal with the problem once and for all. Joe here made me extremely happy, for he did not overact, and his untranslatable curses amused the whole picture. Bravo Joe!
3. Marvin played by Daniel Stern - Harry's accomplice and one of the funniest characters in the entire series. He behaves like a typical goof who falls for the most obvious traps, which amuses the viewer. But Daniel is replaying here again, unfortunately. But I will praise all the same!
Well, in the luxurious Plaza Hotel, its owner, who a few years later will become the President of the United States, Donald Trump, appeared for a few seconds.
The fees for this part were a little more modest, but this did not stop the greedy producers, and after a while, they rolled out the third part to the audience, where Kevin and the other heroes were not. Well, what happened in the end - I'll tell you next time.
Kevin McCallister's story ends on a high note! Bye Kevin! But at any moment, with great pleasure, we will review the first and second parts.
Not a masterpiece, but a good and funny movie.
As a result, we have a good continuation about the adventures of Kevin McCallister, with a good and well-developed script, a great Christmas atmosphere, great humor and good acting.
My rating is 8 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Most of the movie was good, but the action scene was horrifying and sadistic","I will say that most of this movie was funny and that gives it a better rating. The problem is that the action scene was extremely disturbing. One reviewer said this is for 15 year olds, but I'm 15 and I hated the violence in this movie. This is supposed to be a family film but instead it turns into a pg rated torture flick with Kevin throwing 5 bricks at a guys face from a 4 story building. The same guy getting electrocuted and them showing a highly disturbing scene of him getting vaporized with skeleton showing. A man with his hat on fire and his head blowing up in a toilet full of kerosene. To top it all off the kid sets fire to a rope and watches the criminals fall from a 4 story building with their feet on fire. Film makers please stop showing torture and cruelty as something casual to laugh at. That whole half hour was too sadistic and brutal to be in a pg rated film.Fortunately though the rest of the movie makes up for this horrible and prolonged torture fest. The jokes in the rest of the movie are hilarious and had me cracking up. When the hotel guys were getting fooled by the audio track from that movie was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a movie. The movie had many other moments that had me laughing and liking the movie. Unfortunately though the action part of the film was so horrifyingly brutal it makes it hard to recommend this movie. Perhaps best to just skip the brick and electrocution scenes, but still enjoy the rest of the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Better than the first.,"I don't know what people have against family movies (besides harry potter obviously) but the pathetic rating that this movie got on IMDb really does not reflect how good this movie is. Thanks to originality and some great ideas, Home Alone was also one of the best movies when it released and its sequel is even better than the first, with a more detailed and extensive setting, a new array of characters who are also very well developed. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern return and their performances are as brilliant and unmissable as usual. Todays movies may be slightly better made but the Home Alone series are definitely classics. Too bad McCauley culkin went all druggie and all. This movie gave him a lot of credibility at one time.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Macaulay Who?,"Since the early 80s, writer/producer (and sometime director) John Hughes has had his finger on the pulse of contemporary America.  Responsible for such films as `The Breakfast Club,' the wildly successful National Lampoon `Vacation' series (including `Christmas Vacation,' which to many has become a holiday staple, right up there with `A Christmas Carol' and `It's A Wonderful Life') and another favorite around Thanksgiving time, `Planes, Trains and Automobiles,' he nevertheless achieved his greatest commercial success when he came up with the idea of having a little boy getting inadvertently left behind when his family goes off for a Christmas vacation to Paris.  That, of course, was `Home Alone.'  But he didn't stop there. Some two years later that same little boy boards the wrong plane and ends up in New York City while his parents and the rest of his family go to Florida, in `Home Alone 2-- Lost In New York,' directed by Chris Columbus.Once again the extended McCallister family is off for the Christmas holidays, and this time Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) winds up alone in New York. Luckily for him, however, he somehow manages to end up with his father's carry-on, which just happens to contain a credit card.  And by using the kind of ingenuity that would escape most adults, he successfully checks himself into the Plaza Hotel under his dad's name, whereupon he soon discovers room service.  He also discovers Duncan's Toy Store (to which he is transported in style via the Plaza's limo, complete with cheese pizza just for him), a pigeon lady (Brenda Fricker) in Central Park, and some old acquaintances from back home, Marv (Daniel Stern) and Harry (Joe Pesci), the `Wet Bandits' themselves, though now known (since breaking out of prison) as the `Sticky Bandits.'  Meanwhile, mom and dad (Catherine O'Hara and John Heard) are frantic in Florida when they arrive and realize that Kevin is once again gone missing.  And with that, the search is on.  Meanwhile, back in New York--Opting to ride the `Home Alone' series out as writer/producer, Hughes placed the project in capable hands with director Columbus (who also directed the original `Home Alone,' and more recently the hugely successful `Harry Potter).  This one may not have been a stretch for him artistically, especially since the characters had been previously established in the first one, but comedy of any kind can be touchy, as it is such a purely subjective arena, and Columbus does a good job of keeping the story on track (for the most part) and moving it right along.  Wisely, the filmmakers chose to proceed on the assumption that everyone had seen `Home Alone,' and therefore waste little time setting things up.  Instead, they contrive to get Kevin posthaste to New York -- where the story really begins-- and even if you haven't seen the first one this will work for you, because this, as they say, isn't brain surgery.Even so, it's a fairly uneven film.  There's a few laughs in the rush and flurry of getting Kevin to the Big Apple, but at that point Culkin is expected to carry the film, and quite frankly, left alone (no pun intended) it's a task for which he is simply not qualified.  He was veritably propelled to stardom when he played Kevin the first time around, but now-- two years later and two years older-- whatever `cuteness' or magic he may have had then is already noticeably starting to fade.  All that aside, however, the truth of the matter is he's just not that capable as an actor, paling in comparison to Haley Joel Osment or `Potter's' Daniel Radcliffe. Culkin's timing is poor and his reactions lack the spontaneity that would have made Kevin a bit more believable.  His whole presentation of the character just seems too forced; and the attitude he conveys is more caustic than cute, which certainly detracts from his credibility, as well.Oscar winner (for `My Left Foot') Brenda Fricker has a dismally thankless role as the `Pigeon Lady' who connects with Kevin in the park.  With her character, Hughes and Columbus are obviously attempting to recapture the poignancy of the Culkin/Roberts Blossom `church' scene in the original (which worked very well); but Fricker's heavy-handed dramatics, combined with Culkin's aloof response to her, is almost too embarrassing to watch. And the sight of Fricker standing statue-like in the park while pigeons come to roost on her head and shoulders is neither comical nor touching, but ridiculous.  In Fricker's defense, it wasn't entirely her fault; she was simply given material that didn't work and a part that was a no-win situation from the beginning.The only thing that really saves this picture at all is, without question, the slapstick antics of Marv and Harry.  When they at last engage in battle with Kevin (and you know it's coming), it's more violent than the Road Runner cartoons it emulates, but manages to produce some out-and-out, over-the-top, bona fide belly laughs.  Because-- forget everything else-- these two guys are dumber than a sackful of hammers, and Columbus successfully milks it for all it's worth and then some.  A warning to kids, though:  These buffoons are professionals; do not try this stuff at home.The supporting cast includes Tim Curry (Concierge), Dana Ivey (Mrs. Stone), Rob Schneider (Cedrick), Devin Ratray (Buzz), Ralph Foody (Gangster Johnny), Kieran Culkin (Fuller), Eddie Bracken (Mr. Duncan) and Gerry Bamman (Uncle Frank).  Culkin may be the `star' of this show, but without the talent they surround him with, `Home Alone 2-- Lost In New York' would've had to be retitled `Lost at the Video Store,' with a shelf life of about two minutes before disappearing altogether.  As it is, thanks to some cunning maneuvers by the filmmakers, this one at least provides some passable entertainment and a few good laughs.  For a satisfying evening at the movies you could certainly do worse than this; but you could do much better, too.  I rate this one 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Geeky Randy's summary,"Very clever sequel to the 1990 blockbuster, with this McCallister Christmas vacation following Culkin as he wonders the Big Apple after boarding the wrong flight, only to bump into Pesci and Stern, whom have just escaped from prison and are still angry about their foiled plan from the previous year. Aside from a couple of minor characters, pretty much everyone from the first movie reprises their roles. Heard and O'Hara are still great (and still underrated) as the parents; however, it's Curry and Schneider in memorable scenes at the Plaza Hotel that make this outing an hilarious classic. John Williams expands on his score, making the soundtrack by itself worth listening to. But the film is not without its flaws: specifically, the story structure is way too similar to its predecessor, and the traps are far more irresponsible and less funny than the first. Still, if you love the original, this one will find its way onto your Holiday Watch List.***½ (out of four)",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

The booby traps were even better than the original, like there was one where Marv was electrocuted. I didn't think Home Alone 3 was bad, but Home Alone 4 was a complete disaster. Its strange how this can be called ''Home Alone 2'' even though kevin is not in his own house. A 6.5/10 is underrated, so I think that should be raised a little bit more.

"Unbelievable, but much better than the original movie","The whole movie ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" was a much better story than the original ""Home Alone"", even though it did have a lot of the same dumb moments in the movie. Things like Kevin's supposed stories getting him access to a plane to New York and entry to an expensive hotel room. Then his family's insult to Florida with their supposed bad experience. For crying out loud, they whine about being stuck inside the hotel because of the rain in Florida, yet I hate to tell you this, but snow (which they seem to like) is simply frozen rain. Then, while they're still in Florida, Kevin can get things for himself by simply telling people stupid stories, and out of nowhere he has just what he needs to torture the hotel workers and the criminals.It gets especially bad when he makes the remodeling house of his relatives the center of torture for the same criminals. The scenario is a lot like and maybe even worse than the original movie; he nearly does enough to murder the criminals and things that could possibly destroy the entire house itself.Although I did like the characters like the Pigeon Lady and Mr. Duncan from the toy store, but that was about it. The scenarios with things like Kevin's tricks on the hotel employees (things that would hopefully get police called), alongside his supposed brilliant catch of the criminals using his torture. Note, after all of this he actually does call the police effortlessly. The whole movie is, for the most part, unbelievable and dumb as well.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
A great sequel!,I think Home Alone 2 Lost in New York is a great sequel to the first Home Alone movie! In this sequel Kevin McCallister is planning to go on a trip to Miami Florida with his family but accidentally gets separated from them at the airport and accidentally gets on a plane to New York City.

"Fun movie, but its not that bad","""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" takes place after the events of the first one as Kevin is finally going on a Christmas vacation with his family, but gets left behind again as he ends up in New York instead of going to Florida as where his family is going. Now Harry and Marv are back as they went from being the Wet Bandits to the Sticky Bandits, try to get revenge on Kevin as Kevin deals with them again as he saves Christmas and stopping them from stealing the money's charity that were suppose to be donated to the children's hospital by Ducan's Toy Chest. Okay, I'll admit that this movie is not as good as the first one but I don't think it deserves the hate it gets. I've seen sequels that are worse than ""Home Alone 2."" Heck, I think the third and fourth are worse than the second; the fifth I did not seen and would not have any desire to give it a watch. I think, in my humble opinion, ""Home Alone 2"" is a fun sequel than any of the ""Home Alone"" sequels that got made. I thought John Hughes did a fine job with the script as well as what Chris Columbus had to do for directing it. John Williams' music is just as good as the first one, and the cast did great. Macaulay Culkin really does well as he did in the first. Even Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern both still made a great chemistry together. Of course, you got to have Tim Curry who is indeed a lot of fun. Brenda Fricker was good too, but she is just another version of Roberts Blossom from the first movie (forgot to mention that Roberts Blossom is also really good in the first one). I thought some of the slapstick in the movie were really good, but some were flat; the movie does have some fine humor, but weren't as good as the first. I really do love some of the shots in New York along with some of the Christmas scenery that are in this movie. I understand some of the similarities that were done in the first one, but it wasn't 100 percent carbon copy. You still get some things that are different. I would have mind if they have tried something new, but I do give it a pass because I was already entertained enough with this movie. I do wonder why Kevin's family is watching ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in Spanish when they are in Florida as the movie they are watching should have been in English. In the first one, the same movie they are watching is in French which makes sense because they are in Paris. However, you can make an argument if the reason they are watching ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in Spanish is that there weren't any Christmas movies to watch so they ended watching this movie in Spanish because its a Christmas movie. If its true, then I get it but that is just me. Also, not sure if I'm wrong or not that Kevin's father should have just checked on Kevin on how is he doing as they are running to catch their flight to Florida. It's your call on that. Lastly, I wish if the family would stop treating Kevin like garbage as for what they did in the first one. Should have learn their lessons. With that said, I don't think the movie deserves to be ignore because I think it deserves the attention as what the first one did; the third; fourth and fifth movies are the ones that need to be ignore. That's just my opinion on that. ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" is a fun movie, but its not that bad; I still think its fun, entertaining, and still has that Christmas feeling as what made the first one so good about it. Not sure if I put this in the underrated category, but I know its not as bad as what everyone makes it out to be. I say give it a chance! I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

In this film he did a lot of crazy things, which you will see when you watch this great film.
The movie tells children how to be aware of thieves and how to use common sense to people and thieves. It makes me laugh every time I see it. I love every moment of it to absolute bits. This film is gripping and the acting is perfect.

A duplicate for the story but also for the good memories (DVD),"For the inside view of those movies, you can read my review for ""Home alone"". Here, I just want to compare this sequel to the original.I think ""variation"" would be a more accurate word than sequel, because you find exactly the same ingredients: the family feud, the fast departure, the lone mysterious figure, the wet bandits,  I can't recall a brand where such a copy happens.In addition, the spirit of Christmas is a bit lost. If New York is a wonderful town, it hasn't the warm of a suburb or a mansion.However, the movie is more fun than the first one. It's one of the few movies that make me laugh till I cry. Really! I'm just fond of the Joe Pesci whom bad temper grows bigger and bigger as the hits he takes!And the soundtrack is just awesome: the score from John Williams, close to ""Hook"" written in the same period, is an excellent example of the musical power and how can score is essential to movies (and life)! From my recent watchings, ""300"" is a great movie but doesn't enter my Pantheon because it lacks THE score. I can't even hum the main theme! That's not the case here and that's why I remember to have bought then the audiotape to listen again and again to it, the Darlene love song, the Christmas Carols! Woof: such cool memories!So it's a pleasure to make them discover to the kid, to hand on the torch",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Should be in the top lists of best sequels of all time like Aliens or Shrek 2,"Home Alone 2 shouldn't work, but it oddly does? It does so by keeping the spirit of the original alive by improving it and making the stakes and plot bigger and better! And here's why.Home Alone 2 follows Kevin from the first movie, except instead of being left alone at his home he instead gets alone in the city of New York (he got separated from his family in the airport), he learns how to fend himself in the big city and to encounter a familiar villain from the first film.First off the positives, the movie is much longer than the first one but doesn't feel like it- instead the length feels generous and you don't really want to leave the wintery streets of New York. Building on this critique I think it builds up an excellent atmosphere, just like in the second movie- it breathes christmas through and through. The direction is nostalgically filmed and grand for a movie like this, it looks good with effective shots. The music isn't as memorable as the first one but serves a good purpose throughout.The actors are excellent as well, delivering their best comedic timing (I mean, who doesn't love Tim Curry!?).If there are any negatives to be said well... I'd say it's the same as the first one, so many plot points are very hard to explain for this movie, for example how couldn't the family see Kevin go out of the plain when they arrive to Florida? Or didn't the mum check for her son in the plane? It all feels a bit strange but then you have to remember this is a Home Alone movie so just go with the flow. I guess it is kind of hard to write another disappearance and trying to make it make sense, because in a way the characters should have learned from the mistakes of the first movie but eh, it's better not to think too hard about it!Either way this movie succeeds as a great sequel, building up the ante and just being pure unadulterated Christmas fun. Check it out, if you have seen the first one!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
I Like This Better Than The First,"While not everybody seems to be a fan of the first two Home Alone movies, and it seems like everybody has seen them and remembers Macaulay Culkin mostly from when he starred in these movies. The second Home Alone didn't make as much money as the first Home Alone, and while neither of these movies are bad I'm surprised they made as much money as they did. It seems like movies that have tried to copy off the slapstick humor or even Home Alone theme haven't done as well since the first two. I mean one movie I like more than Home Alone and feel like it has more of a plot, is Blank Check. If you watch Blank Check, you'll notice numerous similarities. While I believe you can find the first two movies on TV all year around, you'll most definitely find them on TV during the Holiday Season on channels like ABC Family. I even have a friend who called the Holiday Season The Home Alone Season, as these films are on TV then and seem like the most popular Christmas films. When movie rental stores were open it was hard to rent Home Alone around Christmas. These Home Alone movies show a somewhat wealthy family getting ready for a vacation. I mean a family that is going on vacation with their extended family to Paris in the first film and Florida in the second. In both movies, the youngest Kevin doesn't get on the plane with them. They're movies that will put you in the Holiday Season spirit. I mean, I'm sure most of us have watched both Home Alone movies more than once. I always enjoy watching them during the Holiday Season as they get you into the Christmas Spirit, and you'll probably really remember the movie from past Holiday Seasons. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie outside the Holiday Season, because just like you likely wouldn't listen to Christmas music outside the Holiday Season, this movie makes the Holiday Season special, just gives you a feeling of it. But, what I like better about the second movie than first. I watched the first movie like six months ago and didn't enjoy it as much. Yeah, I'm sure I'll see it again especially during the holiday season, but I've noticed the first one seems somewhat dark, quiet, it seems mostly about Kevin, and there aren't many exciting scenes until the climax which we mostly remember the movie for. I like the 2nd one, because it is less quiet, I mean Kevin is around more people while in the first movie he was just in his quiet neighborhood that all his neighbors seemed to leave. In this one, he's in NYC the City that never sleeps, and NYC is really exciting and fun to be at during the Holiday Season as this movie clearly shows, and it shows Florida as not being as exciting to be at during the Holiday Season as like whenever they show his family in Florida, it's raining. Kevin has more excitement, as rather than just being left at home he is having his own vacation in a really nice hotel along with getting a limousine. It shows a toy store Duncan's Toy Chest, which is supposed to be off of FAO Schwartz. The traps in this movie are more funny and violent, I mean I crack up every time I watch this movie, and a lot of the traps would have left the burglars dead. So, it will likely keep you laughing as we see a face off between Kevin and the burglars. It's also a great movie to watch if you want to see the excitement of NYC during the holiday season. While this movie isn't like my favorite movie I give it a 10/10 because I think it is well done.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Lost in New York,"Yet another Christmas phenomenon by Chris Columbus; this movie is light-hearted and funny. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern really make this 90s feature one of the biggest hits of its time.
Tim Curry makes for a great side-villain and many humorous slap-stick movements.This movie does suffer from... a nonsensical storyline where the main character could have dialled 911 at least 5 times in the movie before he actually decides to do it, where the villains just go ahead and tell their entire plot to the protagonist and whatnot but I guess that's part of it being a kid's film.As much as this movie is good, it's predecessor is far better and generally funnier.

A Worthy Sequel To A Holiday Classic,"Normally, sequels to great films more often than not fail to live up to the first one, usually because the producers feel the urge to rush them out with whatever story they can glue together in five minutes without incorporating what made the original film great. Every now and then, though, sometimes Hollywood gets it right a second time. 1992's ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" is one such case. Taking place one year after the events in the first film, the cast once again includes the charming Macaulay Culkin as that devilish but lovable Kevin McCallister and pretty much everyone else, from Catherine O'Hara as the mother, to Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as the bungling thieves Harry and Marv. Once again the family is readying for another Christmas trip, this time to Miami, and like the first one, the alarm doesn't go off when it's supposed and it's a mad rush to the airport. Only this time, instead of leaving Kevin behind, Kevin manages to get to the airport but alas gets on the wrong flight after following a man who has the same coat, same hair style from the back as his father does! As you can probably guess from the title, Kevin ends up in New York, checks into the fancy Plaza Hotel with his dad's credit card (Were we are treated to a cameo from the Donald himself, Mr. Donald Trump, the owner of the hotel at the time) and living the dream. However, he won't be able to rest for long; Harry and Marv have busted out of prison and they decide to go to (Where else?) New York. Of course, it means another Christmas in the trenches as Kevin must prevent the two heartless but dimwitted thieves from knocking off a toy store whose proceeds are to go to the children's hospital. Can Kevin win again or are the tables to be turned?Although it may not be quite on the same level as the first one, I can honestly say I have just as much fun watching ""Home Alone 2"" every year as I do the original. A big reason for this is probably due to the return of almost all the cast members, and I do mean almost everyone, from John Heard as the father to Gerry Bamman as the much hated Uncle Frank. Another reason is the return of Chris Columbus as director, whose shots of New York are as dazzling and enchanting as those in the first one. Indeed, Central Park has rarely been filmed as beautifully as it is here. Plus, the script is once again written by the late, great John Hughes, which means the story has plenty of laughs in addition to heart. True, the skits in this one are a bit more outrageous than in the original (In one scene, the film asks us to believe that a person, in this case Marv, can be hit with multiple bricks from a five story window and not suffer death or permanent brain damage!). However, folks, considering that this is a holiday comedy, I don't think it's too much to ask that we suspend our disbelief just a little. As for the music score, once again the legendary John Williams does his magic, producing what could be an even better score than the first, including new songs like the heart tugging ""Christmas Star"", one of the most beautiful and underrated Christmas songs ever. In many ways, you could say ""Home Alone 2"" is remake of the first one, only one that retains both the comedy and magic of the original version (Something that can't be said for any of the ones that followed it!). So, with all that said, gather around children and watch that most rarity of rarities, a truly magical sequel in the form of ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"". And, regardless of what time of year it may be, Merry Christmas!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good but.....,"The movie was excellent, filled with traps and comedy. But I don't understand how those criminals stood the pain, they just didn't give up, how? Marv got a huge voltage shock and was ok after a little time, same with Harry. Anyway it was a funny movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Better than the first,"Well the Christmas season will be upon us soon! To help celebrate my all time favorite time of year, I have certain holiday movies. Home Alone 2: lost in New York is one of my favorites. This sequel to the 1990 hit is better than the original in many ways if you ask me. Culkin is no different here, he's just fine, like in the original. What is better/different here is the quality of comedy and the entertainment value. The first home alone certainly isn't bad, but I do feel like this one exceeds the original as far as entertainment goes. Joe Pesci and his assistant Marv (the sticky bandits) are even better/funnier here than the first time around. The action is better here, and in my opinion, the acting is better. I really loved Catherine O'Hara here too, thought she was hilarious in her role, and the dialogue her character is given really helps boost her funny, touching performance. ""The way I'm feeling no mugger/murderer would dare mess with me"". Lol bravo. John heard is fine here, his acting/character really doesn't have to be good in any way, his character is okay just kinda being there. The subplot with Kevin and the homeless woman who saves him is very sweet and touching, I really do love that they included that in the film's plot, really added a lot to it. Tim Curry is also to be applauded too for his funny performance as the Ritz hotel manager. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Now he's alone in New York, and he's become even more dangerous....","The sequel. It's always a difficult topic. The second part after the first successful film should be no less cool, but it often happens that it is the sequels that ruin the wonderful original stories. To my great pleasure, ""Home Alone 2"" became that gorgeous sequel, about which you can always say without a shadow of a doubt that the sequel turned out to be very worthy. And this movie, like the first one, can be endlessly reviewed every Christmas and New Year.Director Chris Columbus follows the classic precepts of the sequel. He repeats the story of the first film, but complicates the plot and makes everything much bigger. It is unlikely that it will be news to anyone that the main character Kevin will be lost again. However, now he has to find himself not just alone at home, but alone in New York, one of the largest cities on the planet. And here the boy will not lose face, but thanks to a successful combination of circumstances, he will try to spend the holidays to the fullest. But old acquaintances Harry and Marv will break into his life again. Wet bandits gracefully ""mimic"" into sticky bandits, and the confrontation between them and the now ten-year-old boy will make you enjoy watching what is happening on the screen.The painting repeats its original very much. It's noticeable. But at the same time, the creators are ready to offer something special that will connect the story with the first film, as if recalling what happened a couple of years ago, but at the same time will present something unique. The film is full of good jokes, hilarious falls, bumps and other attractions, where the screen villains will get much stronger than last time. But all these repetitions look good, there is no sense of incongruity. Rather, on the contrary, I want to see Kevin defeat his rivals again and again. That's why it's a fairy tale, so that the good turns out to be stronger, and everything that happens (though sometimes deadly) was made up.Acting, as before, is on top. The trio of main characters holds up perfectly in the frame. Macaulay Culkin has grown up a little, it feels like he has become adept at acting. But Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci remained the same. These are all the same native villains, whom you empathize with more and more often, realizing how many times guys have already had to die from one trap or another. Once I even came across a video where it was calculated how many times the villains would have died for both Columbus films. In general, they would have no chance of survival.The second picture, like the first, creates an amazing Christmas atmosphere, literally full of bright green and red flowers. The abundance of colors allows you to get into the spirit of Christmas and New Year, and the setting of the story leaves no chance for the film to become an unshakable classic, which more than one generation has been reviewing every year and, hopefully, will continue.The film is full of dynamics, memorable supporting characters. What are the appearances of a whole ensemble of comedic incarnations, including Tim Curry, Rob Schneider and Dan Ivey. Their characters in the huge hotel were very funny. The others are also good.But, as before, the relationship between a mother and a young son comes to the fore. Even if they are copied, we saw the development of the characters' relationships in the first picture, in this case, it seems to me, it would not be superfluous to repeat and convey to the viewer that the most important thing in life is family. Despite all the possible hardships, it is always important to remember who the people closest to you are.""Home Alone 2"" is a good and interesting story that is definitely worth putting on the list for viewing at least on New Year's holidays. This is a perfectly packaged (as a gift) story of family vicissitudes, interesting action and, of course, an incredible fairy tale that you want to continue to believe in.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Christmas Vacation Calamity,"This is another of my favorite sequels, childhood gems and an honorable mention in favorite Christmas films. I remember seeing this in the theater, to me it was one of the best times I ever had in the theater as it was just a festival of up roaring laughter. Yeah, it's true this sequel doesn't surpass the original, but I don't feel it's trying to, and yes it's not perfect but it has it where it counts because like with the original it sets itself out for what it wants to be holiday fun.What I like about the sequel is it has sort of an adventurous feel to it, as we see Kevin is out of his comfort zone and is in a fascinating but strange land. Once again there is sort of that wish fulfilment fantasy tale, as we as kids and even adults have dreamed of having that perfect Christmas vacation someplace, we want and having the time of our life our way. Like seeing Kevin ordering room service eating Triple Scooped ice cream sundae and he says one of my favorite lines, ""make it triple, I'm not driving"" wonder if any kids or adults thought about saying that whenever they ordered ice cream for room service, on a side note, would love to try that hotel's ice cream.We see Kevin once again watching a sequel (ironically) to that gangster film from the first movie. It's just hilarious as we see once again Johnny whom as usual has an explosive temper. He says another favorite quote, ""I believe you, but my Tommy Gun don't!"" damn this guy has serious anger management issues. On a side note, there were some other R rated films Kevin saw that were stacked up beside the one he is watching, shame there wasn't a scene or two to see what those films are.I really like that we get to see some of New York if not a whole lot which is one little weak point of the film. From that hotel which is a real hotel I'd someday like to find so I can visit the location of where the film was filmed. We even see him go to a place called Dunkins Toy Chest which is nice looking, though the place has no toys nor even a video game department, it looks more like a ""Hallmark"" store which is weird; Kevin should've requested ""Toys R Us"", damn I miss that place in fact toy stores in general.Music is good there is the same memorable score by John Williams and some new track one song I really like that's became a Christmas favorites are ""Christmas Tree"" (the version where Buzz didn't frak things up) and ""Distant Goodnights"" which I'll admit really has a sweet but sorrowful feel. There is one scene that is a bit of a heartstring pull as both Kevin and his mom say good night to each other from a distance, it reminds us and Kevin despite all the fun and games, he's still unhappy deep down and misses his family just as his mom feels guilt once again bears the burden of guilt and misses him.Characters are good, Kevin as usual is Kevin whom to me is the master trickster. Once again, he's on the sympathetic side as he can never seem to catch a break with his family. He once again gets punished for something he really isn't guilty of. Buzz (somedays I really hate that guy) whom as usual is being a idiot decided to play a prank on Kevin in the entire school. Personally after that stunt, if I was the director of that production I would kick Buzz out, you pull crap like that in every production you don't get to perform and seriously McCallister family stop being so leanant toward Buzz that's probably what lead him to doing stupid crap in the first place; sorry this sounded bold but I had to get that out. And once again Karma is on Kevin's side as he gets to have the time of his life.But one thing I really like that Kevin has is the Talk boy, which I thought was cool at the time, this was way before phone app tech. It's basically a tape recorder, but it has a mike and a way to manipulate your voice to sound like an anonymous voice dub. This device no doubt comes in handy for Kevin throughout the film and it would be cool if they made a ""Home Alone Talk boy"" app where we can recreate those features.Tim Curry one of my favorite actors is great as the Concierge. He's almost the subordinate villain in film, ok not really, more of just your obstacle. He's a guy that is completely uptight, really wants to run the hotel like a tight ship. But a little on the egocentric side as he really wants to bust Kevin to both keep his hotel intact but also to inflate his ego. It' s just funny the certain reaction he has toward Kevin's trick which crack me up.The Wet Bandits or Sticky Bandits whichever you prefer, as usual are themselves, they haven't changed as both are still nincompoops. I like the fact that this time they've stepped up their game as their now robbing stores instead of houses. This plan would work if it wasn't for one poison pill in the plan which they're at fault for taking which is a weak point I'll get to latter. But these guys are funny as usual, from their typical back and forth and the spills they rightfully take.The humor as usual is hilarious just spot one, from another scene with the Concierge and his company when they go to Kevin's room they are once again duped by one of Kevin's tricks as he is playing the Gangster pic loud. I won't give away what happens next you just must see it yourself it's just hilarious.
But of course, down to the final battle which is a physical humor/slapstick comedy fest and even more violent and painful than before. I won't give too much away on that I'll just state a couple of the traps.The first one is of course the beginning of the battle, where the robbers stupidly think Kevin will corroborate in throwing down the camera and Harry says another of my favorite lines though was common at the time, ""I cross my heart and hope to die."" I snickered when he said that because it's like he's practically telling Kevin to take him out. And of course, Kevin throws down something toward them, lets just say his Christmas gift to Marv.Another of course is the electrocution scene which I was just laughing my head off toward, that one is sort of a live action ""Looney Tunes"" gag. Just hearing Marv's screams was just music to my ears. But we also see his skeleton as he's being shocked. Another that's sort of a Looney Tunes gag is the teeter totter which cracks me up, but it cracks me up even more the fact that Harry wasn't smart enough to get off it immediately, yeah fast one Harry.But this sequel does miss a trick or two that really holds it back a little for me, I'll just state a few. I don't like how there are some moments of stupidity that I felt could easily have been avoided in the writing. Like that mis boarding scene, I don't like how that was handled. The whole battery thing was stupid and a cheap device, seriously Kevin couldn't wait to get on board to replace his batteries. Personally, it should have been some sort of holiday rush riot where it was not just the McCallister family but every other family and group that was rushing to their planes and somehow Kevin gets lost in that crowd. Let alone the stupidity of the Robbers whom had a good plain and would have succeeded if they just left Kevin alone, which I'll admit is a plot hole.There are also a few too many coincidences, from the Robbers being in New York the same time Kevin came. Or Kevin's uncle and aunt having a place they were renovating that happens to be in New York. I do believe in coincidences, but this is just too big to swallow. Didn't like the whole gun thing with Harry and Marv, it felt out of place and out of character.The film doesn't quite bring much new to the table as it has that fundamental problems some sequels have, where it does seem just a bit like the same film in places just dressed differently make the film a tad predictable; though same could be said for certain slasher franchises out there like the ""Friday the 13th"" films but that didn't make them bad (or not all of them) so I can't complain too much on that.I honestly didn't care for the bird lady character, she not a bad character but by her nature she really a filler character that I could take or leave but all the same really there to fill in empty space and time much like Harry on ""Doctor Who"".If Kevin was suppose of have a secondary character along the way it either should have been one of the members of his family which would have been interesting, it would help shed light as to who that family member is in the multitude of members as well as provide depth on the family but may 'be further the stakes for Kevin as he not just has to protect himself but a member of his family, but it would help make the film a little different sort of like a buddy buddy film, could of also meant extra traps see this other member's tactician skills. I don't know it's a nice thought, anyway, shame it was never considered.Overall, despite being one of those mixed bag movie/sequels I still had fun with this film which really is most of the time all I can ask for sequels. ""Home Alone 2"" like any holiday vacation is worth a trip.Rating: 3 stars",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Oddly enough, the best of them all","Maybe a sequel to a movie like ""Home Alone"" wasn't the brightest idea Hollywood has ever produced, but the result is really something to see. Sure, it's extraordinarily unlikely that any family would lose their child on vacation not long after they abandoned him at home in the original. Nonetheless, ""Lost in New York"" is certainly better than ""Home Alone 3,"" a stupid spy story not even stomach-able. Macaulay Culkin is in peak form as the abandoned Kevin. Tim Curry, Dana Ivey, and Rob Schneider are wonderfully idiotic as the bumbling hotel employees who catch onto the fact that Kevin is really alone. And Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern rule the face of the planet, once again, as the ""Wet Bandits,"" the worst criminals in history. People tend to run this movie down for being ""predictable"" and ""mindless,"" but if you remove the fact that the kid was in a similar situation before, it actually makes for fantastic Christmas entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
I liked this movie!,"Home Alone 2 is pretty good, but I liked the first one better. Even though this is a great film, the originality is lost. This time around, Kevin gets left behind at the airport while the rest of the family travels to Florida. Meanwhile, Kevin gets on the wrong flight and heads to New York. While in New York City, Kevin learns that the two bandits from the first film escaped from prison and are planning to rob a toy store. Now, Kevin has to foil their plans while he is dealing with management from the hotel he's at. The formula is basically the same as the first film. There is nothing new, but I liked it anyway. Macualay Culkin is great once again as Kevin. Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci are funny as the bandits. Even Tim Curry and Brenda Fricker are decent in their roles. The music is something good to listen to with all the great Christmas songs. Overall, this is a great Christmas family film. I rate this movie 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

New home,"This is a film that takes place a year after the events of the first. It brings Kevin to a new place to cause mischief with those two burglars. This time his family goes to Florida and doesn't forget him this time. While going to the plane, Kevin accidentally takes a flight to the grand New York City by himself. At times, it does seem like the first but in New York. Still, I feel like it is as good as the first. Often I feel like a sequel is as good as the original or even slightly better. IMDb often disagrees with me on this. I don't know exactly why for most franchises I feel that way. The sequel tends to just seem as good in my opinion. I find both these first two Home Alone movies help get you in the Christmas spirit. I have little interest in watching Home Alone 3 as it has a different kid. Don't know, I might watch it down the line just to see what it is about but as of right now, I have little interest in it as it doesn't have the same character as the first 2.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
I Like it more than the first,"This my be weird too read, but I actually think this movie is better than the original. I'm not talking like Back to the Future 1 and 2 where I like the second one more but acknowledge that the first is better. No, I actually think that this movie is objectively better than the first film. Now don't get me wrong, I like the first film, but I just think this is stronger. But what do I know.Basically whenever someone criticizes this movie they will say it sucks because it's just a rehash of the first movie. And they are technically right, but that's one of the things I like about it. And the film sort of knows this and pokes fun at it sometimes. For me, the bad stuff boils down to breaking the laws of physics sometimes, and not enough of Kevin's family.But everything that works in the first movie works here. And it fixes some of the stuff that didn't work for me. In the first movie I thought it was kind of contrived how Kevin just automatically assumed he made his family disappear and how he never called the cops and just tell them that the buglers were coming to his house. In this movie those problems are fixed. I love the scenes in the hotel, Tim Curry is just so much fun to watch. I actually think it's funnier than the first, and it still gives that Christmas feeling.I know no one will agree with me, but in my opinion, this sequel actually is better than the original.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Best of the Home Alone Movies!,"This one surpasses the original. Has the same cast but a new story! Kevin is separated from his family once more. Only this time He accidentally goes to New York instead of Florida which his family and relatives went to.Kevin wish he could go to somewhere way different, all by himself.

Which is like heaven when he entered. And Kevin can tell this will be his best X-Mas yet.When all seemed good, 2 familiar guys show up in New York. And you guessed it Harry and Marv! They escaped from prison and instead of robbing homes they're going to rob the famous toy store in New York.Can Kevin stop these guys this time?

"Same basic plot, but same charm and laughs, new setting and material!","While the original Home Alone is indeed a John Hughes classic, Home Alone 3 is okay, 4 and 5 get a few laughs now and then though 4 does the original two dirty, but Home Alone 6 is one of the irredeemably worst movies ever and has no reason to exist. Home Alone 2, however? Right up there alongside the original! In fact, I actually like it slightly better.First off, the story. Once again, the McCallister Family is planning a Christmas trip, this time to Miami. And of course, the night before, Kevin (played by Macaulay Culkin, reprising his role just this once) gets in trouble for acting out and causing a mess again, only this time, when his nasty older brother Buzz (Devin Ratray) humiliates him during his choir solo at a school Christmas pageant, while as usual, Buzz gets away scot-free, because Kevin's mom, Kate (Catherine O'Hara), apparently didn't learn her lesson. This time, though, instead of the alarm clocks getting reset by a power outage caused by an overnight blizzard, they're reset by Kevin's father, Peter (John Heard), stupidly unplugging them and then plugging them back in. And instead of getting left behind in the chaos, Kevin does wake up in time for his family to not forget him... but gets separated from them in the mad dash through the airport after he stops to replace the batteries in his tape recorder. And in the confusion, Kevin ends up going to New York City instead of Miami, and takes his dad's bag with him. Using his dad's credit card, Kevin illegally books himself a suite at the Plaza Hotel. But once again, he encounters Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), who escaped from jail, and have snuck away to to rob toy stores. It's up to Kevin to stop them from robbing Duncan's Toy Chest just before Christmas.Of course, none of the characters have changed since the first movie. Kevin is still the likeable protagonist he originally was. Harry and Marv are still the goofy burglars they were in the first movie. And of course, both Buzz and Kevin's rude uncle Frank (Gerry Bamman) are still the jerks they were in the first movie (though they do thank Kevin at the end).The acting, of course, is fantastic. Everybody returns to their roles from the first movie, and their performances are just as great. Macaulay Culkin, in particular, still displays the same charisma as Kevin that he did in the first movie. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are still as hilarious as Harry and Marv as they were in the first movie. In regards to the new characters, Tim Curry is incredibly funny as the Concierge. Rob Schneider is equally amusing at times as Cedric, the bellboy.And as you would expect from John Hughes, the writing is fabulous! All the humor in this movie makes me laugh every time. Especially the booby traps that Kevin lays down for Harry and Marv in his uncle Rob's empty house. So what if most of the humor is retreaded from the first movie?! What's important is that it's still funny, and a heckuva lot better than, say, the utter mean-spiritedness of Home Alone 6. Plus, Kevin comes up with some fresh, new traps for Harry and Marv. Other fresh, new jokes the movie has in store include the scene where Kevin records Uncle Frank singing tunelessly in the shower, only to get caught (""GET OUTTA HERE, YOU NOSY LITTLE PERVERT, OR I'M GONNA SLAP YOU SILLY!!!!""), and later uses that recording and an inflatable clown to scare off the Concierge. The movie is also heartwarming at times, like when Kevin befriends the Pigeon Lady (Brenda Fricker), even if she's a carbon copy of Old Man Marley from the first movie.And of course, there's the music. John Williams returned to score this movie, and he did a FABULOUS job. He weaved in the melody to ""Somewhere In My Memory"" from the first movie, and even co-wrote two wonderful new songs: ""Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas"", and the CHILLINGLY beautiful ""Christmas Star"".In short, out of all the Home Alone sequels, this is the only one that comes out just as good as, or even better, than the classic original.

This time around Kevin is lost in New York as the family trip to Florida goes completely awry and Kevin takes the wrong plane. Somehow the two characters played by Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern escape from prison and guess what? they are in New York and Kevin bumps into them and hears that they are going to steal from another place and he sets about trapping them and this ends up with plenty of pain for them and every brick thrown gives us a laugh.

The film critics were all wrong!!!,"This sequel was trashed by most film critics. Why? Supposedly, this movie was almost a carbon copy of the original. Supposedly, this sequel was even more cartoonish and violent than the original movie. I completely disagree. There are similarities between this movie and the original. Those similarities absolutely should have been expected. Anyone who enjoyed the original movie (and many people did) should have enjoyed this sequel just as much. This version is not quite as good as the first movie. It takes a little too long for things to get ""rolling."" However, it's ultimately a fun ride, with the same key actors that made the original such a success. Culkin is great as Kevin, and Kevin is essentially the smartest character in the movie. The movie is not all about Kevin's exchanges with the Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern characters. At the beginning, it's about how Kevin's parents tend to disbelieve him, because he doesn't tell them what they want to hear. Later in the movie, Kevin's interaction with the Pigeon Lady (Brenda Fricker) was a nice thing to watch. Kevin showed more compassion to this woman than his parents showed to him. This movie, like the first one, is a great experience for people who like this kind of thing. Apparently, many people, like myself, do like this kind of thing.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hot Take (maybe not that hot): Home Alone 2 > Home Alone,"The two movies are incredibly similar (almost copy + paste), but I think that Home Alone 2 is the stronger of the two. While there was a chaotic energy when Kevin was left home alone, everything is elevated when he is alone in New York. The Plaza Hotel, Duncan's Toy Chest, the taxi ride over the Manhattan Bridge, standing atop the World Trade Center, the list goes on and on about Kevin's adventure in this film.While you have to suspend belief at the convenience of Harry & Marv running into Kevin again, their beatdown is absolutely marvelous. The thumping that Kevin gives to Marv specifically is legendary. The amount of brain damage or near death experiences given to that man in this film is too much to count.The pigeon lady is a bit rough around the edges, but the turtle love moment gives me the feels. The hotel staff, led by Tim Curry, is ridiculous and makes for some fantastic moments. At the end of the day, this movie is one of my favorite Christmas flicks of all time.Best Character: Marv

Being alone on Christmas was never this fun.,"Kevin McAllister is back and alone once again in Home Alone 2: Lost In New York. In the second installment of the home alone movies, Kevin finds himself in a similar situation with a twist. He has gotten lost in the airport on the way to Christmas in Florida, and ends up in New York City with all of the families' money and credit cards. Most young kids would panic, but Kevin takes advantage of the situation, going on a spending spree all around New York City, until he runs into a couple of old friends. Fresh out of Prison, Marv and Harry are up their old scheme when they come across the little kid who sent them to jail. Looking for revenge, Kevin must once again defend himself from the wet bandits. This movie is very closely related to the first. The general plot is the same in both movies, Kevin is stranded away from his family at Christmas time and must defend his house from Marv and Harry the criminals. Many of the tricks kevin uses to keep his distance from the thieves are repeated from the original movie, and sometimes can be repetitive. The movie has its own twists and the action is hilarious throughout the movie, much like the first. The ending is almost identical to the first, exciting and heartwarming. The new setting gives kevin a whole new world of toys to play with. The original movie gave Kevin familiar surroundings and a lot to work with, but stranded at his Aunt and Uncle's house in New York is a bit different. Kevin is forced to make do with what he can find, and it makes for some entertaingig action. New York City instead of a hometown is also a big change, and Kevin reacts differently in a unfamiliar city. The plot is able to stay remarkably the same in the two movies and play out so differently in each to the audience. The characters in each movie are the same, yet different. THe main characters are all the same. The family, Marv and Harry and Kevin are all the same from the first movie. This movie allows for a few more characters to be thrown into the mix, including a woman who lives in Central Park, and the Hotel Desk Manager. The interesting people Kevin meets plays a vital role in the attention of the audience, because the humor carries the film. Everyone kevin crosses paths with in the movie has an impact on his success in the big city. Overall the sequel did live up to the original. The first movie was great, but this one had some magic of its own. The New York setting is a perfect backdrop to the action and humor that plays out in this Christmas classic. Watch them together or separate and they are still both fun and enjoyable movies for the whole family.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A good movie (but again ""3"" is my favorite)","Don't get me wrong I'm not disrespecting the classics that the first 2 are. But I'm not gonna go far to give them an outright praise of glory either.The fact that his family is openly abusive (although, and maybe it's just more that we see Catherine O'Hara, and her hostility seems more manufactured in this movie for the plot rather than genuine in the first movie, and it seems, even then, she's not really trying to be mean, she's the lone exception and, perhaps, feeling guilty for the way she treated him in the first movie) to him still makes this an uncomfortable watch (no one ""Harry Potter"" seemed to have portrayed the Dursleys well; I mean are they not a non-white extention pretty much of the fam from this movie?) Anyways the Allied Nordicist Yankee ""Friends""-watching ""Seinfeld""-hating nature of this fam seems to be in full circle. Buzz and the rest of them, abuse him. This is not a spoiler. It's well-known (you don't have to see the first two to know it). This isn't bashing, though, because it's part of the story at least.Kevin has a Christmas show at his show, which the fam watch. Without giving it out, if you've seen ""Home Alone,"" you know how that's gonna end. All things aside, this leads to the events that cause Kevin to be separated. But unlike the first movie, this is a far more exciting prospect. He's in New York this time, while his fam are in Florida (and to be honest, perhaps it's God's punishment to them that their vacation is far more stinkier, without giving it out, than their original 1990 vacation in Paris, where at least they had good food, and were in a nice hotel, and got to see the Eiffel Tower backdrop). The exciting backdrop is Kevin arrive in NY, in Queens. But it's a little unrealistic, lol, because it's LaGuardia, but it's positioned as though it's right next to the East River, when it's like 20 minutes away from Manhattan. His adventures takes him to Manhattan, where he says at the Plaza Hotel. As you can guess, to add to the hatred and smugness Kevin already deals with, he deals with some smug punks.I won't say too much more. Let's just say it's a thrill ride for the masses (my only complaint is that this movie, along with the first, aired on WPIX - whether they later aired on The WB or, more recently, The CW itself, I don't know, but it's not surprising that much considering that this is flavored like something that Tribune would fund for, if not make, but it did air on WWOR, much like the first movie, as well). The two evil villains, Marv and Harry, will keep you on the edge of your seat. This movie is far deadlier, and the stakes are higher. Along with a mysterious old woman, you are in for an adventure, if you get past the somewhat WPIXish/Tribuneish/The WBish nature of this feature.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

More of the Same (But That's OK),"Child star Macaulay Culkin himself often joked about Home Alone 2, and rightfully so. This movie is a copy and past of the original, with the only change being the location. It takes a great suspension of belief to go along with the idea that, after what happened in the previous film, every single member of the family wouldn't be watching him like a hawk to prevent even the smallest possibility of this happening again.And yet, in a weird way, this film is every bit as good as the original.Macaulay Culkin, while a little flatter in a lot of his delivery of this film (at this point, he was already financially secure and didn't have to rely on a movie like this to make a living), still manages to produce sufficient emotion to carry the film. Taking him away from the comforts of his own home and thrusting him into New York City and expecting him to survive was an intelligent move, even if the journey from Point A to Point B was filled with far too many coincidental occurrences to ever truly be believable.Just like in the first film, Kevin winds up crossing paths with Harry and Marv, the bumbling idiots who can barely perform simple tasks correctly. It's a plot that isn't expanded on at all in this film, mostly because it doesn't have to be; their characters are in the film simply to drive the comedic arc of the film to break up the dramatic elements to make it a little more digestible for younger audiences.Every character who isn't copied over from the original movie (Old Man Marley being the biggest example) are given their own stand-ins who are so familiar -- and, yet again, so coincidental -- that they feel redundantly repetitive. And yet still, the director managed to squeeze some emotions out of those replacement characters to make it an interesting watch.This film adds the delightful Tim Curry to its cast, with his distinct word pronunciations that are an absolute joy to behold every since Christmas season. And they've added a few new jokes, most notably being with the cassette recorder which, while it comes in handy in a number of areas of the plot, records audio in a lot higher quality than any normal cassette recorder ever would.But that's just being picky.It's a successful film that made a lot of money, and it gets a lot of TV airtime over the Christmas season, as it rightfully should. It's a rehash but it's a good rehash; it's a return to the comfort food that makes the holiday season so wonderful.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Lazy, but it's still good like the first","I really don't want to like this movie. It's possibly the laziest sequel in history. The messaging, the story progression, the B plots, the jokes and when they come, even some of the traps are all the exact same as the first or slightly altered. Macaulay kulkin also phones it in, in this movie his acting is so monotone. And yet despite all of this I'd say it's just as good as the first possibly better. Yes it's just the same thing done again and yes the acting isn't as good, but the new traps are so much better in this film and for what it's worth the repeated jokes are actually kinda funnier. I really don't want to like this movie for how lazy it is, but it's hard to not say this at the very least isn't as good as the first because the first one was so well done and this is the exact same with a different coat.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Alone again, in jingle rockin' good sequel","Kevin still hasn't lost his touch. He gets separated this time, happily ending up in New York, while his folks end up in Miami, The McCallisters, not the most responsible of parents (this is the second time). I for one, can't blame Kevin (the odd kid out in the family) for smiling, as having to put up with all those douchebags, he calls family, notably beefcake brother, Buzz and his horrible, irascible Uncle, who I have a pet hate for. Using his parent's credit cards, racking up quite a bill, Kevin lives it up in the famous Plaza hotel, scoring some really suss and sour looks from some hotel staff. And guess who he bumps into, on his travels. So again, he uses his smarts and wits on the wet bandits (Stern so good here) where they take worse spills, and a hell of a lot of pain, trying to overthrow their rival. There are some similarities to the first one, that in no way, dampens this one. Again notable performances are that of O'Hara and, Stern, and Brenda Fricker as a homeless woman, her only friends, manifold of pigeons, and Kevin. Macaulay too is just perfect as before, a role, obviously, he was born to play. It's just a sad reminder, of how he could of been such a bigger star. Rob Reiner too, is very good and memorable as the cutish bellboy. This good sequel delivers, so most HA fans shouldn't be disappointed, especially if you really wanna see what the wet bandits deserve.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Rating: 9.2
Overall, my favorite Christmas movie as this sequel builds on the iconic elements from the first movie, in a borderline satirical way, to show how Kevin can still outsmart the Sticky Bandits on an even larger scale.Great Direction (the direction on a macroscale is grander this time around as there is a higher production budget and the movie makes an effort to show how large New York is in comparison to Kevin; the direction microscale is pretty generic to 80s family comedies; the direction of actors is great as he can bring out the humor and joy in many moments, helps set the lighthearted tone that Kevin brings throughout the movie; storytelling is very similar to other John Hughes movies), Good Acting (Great from Macaulay Culkin (Continues to bring the youthful charm the movie is known for, Great from Joe Pesci (Continues to bring the comedic charm the movie is known for), Very Good from Daniel Stern (Continues to be the good comedic relief partner that plays off of Joe Pesci), Good to Very Good from Tim Curry, Good to Very Good from Catherine O'Hara, Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story (The concept is very satirical because the movie makes an effort to show that the story is the same one as the first (just grander); the plot structure follows the same plot structure as the first movie; flow between sequences is like the first in that its the standard John Hughes movie; character writing was very similar to the first movie as it replicates what the characters are going through this time around), Great Screenplay (The dialogue is pretty simple as its a family movie (but it is filled with iconic lines), the movie also uses dialogue to show how this movie is the same as the first; the humor was very good and iconic (also pokes fun at how this is the same movie as the first); the foreshadowing is good as it helps with showing the message of Kevin nothing being afraid), Great Score (Continues one of John Williams's most iconic scores), Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Good Editing, Visual Effects (), Good Production Design (Makes an effort to show how grand and regal all the places Kevin stays at in NYC), Pacing was great as it was a steady pace that used its runtime very nicely, Build to the climax was great as it helped tie loose ends in Kevin's fears of being alone and with the old man; the climax is the most iconic part of the movie as it shows Kevin against the Sticky Bandits as he lays the house out with traps to defend himself and show how he is not afraid anymore, Tone was very similar to other John Hughes movies (mixed with Christmas elements), This movie has more of a nostalgic factor for me because I watched it more as a childORIGINAL (01/05/2020)

Good sequel,"Good sequel. The original cast return with Culkin in the lead, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as the hilariously dumb, yet slightly endearing criminals with a heart of coal and the fantastic Catherine O'Hara as the mum every child wants, played with just the right amount of fear, guilt, determination and love that is needed. Another noteworthy return is the sequel of gangster spoof Angels with Filthy Souls, Angels with Even Filthier Souls (a reminiscent construction of Angels with Dirty Faces with James Cagney.) New characters are brought to life by Tim Curry, Brenda Fricker, Eddie Bracken, Dana Ivey and a young Rob Schneider.Film critics such as Roger Ebert gave the film negative reviews and saw it as portraying violence as too cartoonish. Despite this fact, the mainstream popularity of the film saw it as a success and to most children of the 90s, the second instalment in the Home Alone series is often seen as equal in quality if not better than the first.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Sequel that didn't fall flat!,"Usually a sequel is never as good as the original, but I really enjoyed watching the bandits stumble a step behind the precocious Kevim! Of course, Kevin's master plan to stay ahead of the crooks is once again, far-fetched for a kid his age with a blueprint,armed with ropes and kerosene (amid such short notice) to thwart every effort of Harry and Marv. Yet, the antics are hysterical like the original, and the story holds your interest from start to finish. Although its quite inconceivable that after the first film that his parents would allow him to get separated from the family again, it had to happen or the sequel would not have been made!

It's a big ole city,"I probably prefer this film to the first film, and I think it's only heightened by the fact that this was set in New York, and the atmosphere of New York City is completely palpable. Since I can remember I've been totally enamoured with the appearance of lights in the dead of night, and their is a lot of those shots in this film, which I wholeheartedly appreciate. The clout that came from the first Home Alone, means that they production got to film in so many fantastic New York locations, like the Carnegie Hall and Rockafella Center. Kevin McCallister has always struck me as an incredibly clever kid, he is portrayed by the talented Macaulay Culkin, and he manages to showcase the smart as a whip personality without coming across as an arrogant. He also seems to have a magnetic charm that simply captures the affection to both children and adults alike. The aspect of the turtle doves was a nice inclusion, to be able to show to the audience the selfless nature of Kevin through his actions. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern return to their roles as the thieves, and once again you have Joe Pesci playing the straight man, his styling of comedy in this film is brilliant to watch as he looks down upon Kevin with utter disdain.

Still a classic! Everything but the original in New York.,"After I sat down and watched all the other home alone movies all over again along with this one. I appreciate how this one is when comparing it to all the other sequels and spinoffs in the franchise after this. Also, who doesn't love Tim curry in this too! I know everybody wanted to see this sequel take place at the Classic McCallister house again but in a weird way, I'm kind of glad they (switched it up a little) had Kevin get lost in an airport for a sequel. Instead of being left at home again. It's more believable! It makes better sense and at least it tries to build another circumstance that shows Kevin's parents are not complete total morons by just leaving Kevin accidentally home alone all over but at least have a similar situation happened. At the end of it all, I just appreciate this sequel more now when I compare it to everything else that came after this.

Better than the first,"This film premiered on Friday, November 20, 1992 in the United States, again directing Chris Columbus.Synopsis:The McCallisters prepare to go on vacation to Florida. The day before Kevin has to sing Christmas carols with his school. The whole family attends and an accident occurs...Kevin must apologize to his family, but he does not believe that it was his fault and does not ask for forgiveness. He is punished to sleep in the attic and, when the vans arrive to take them to the airport (this time the McCallister goes to Miami instead of Paris), they have fallen asleep again. They begin the rush and everyone goes to the airport. This is where Kevin gets distracted from his parents and takes a plane to New York. New York also comes the ""Wet Criminals"", who have escaped from prison and want to hit a toy store. But they have not counted on Kevin ...Review:Even better than its predecessor! For me, it surpasses much to the first part for entertainment and this thanks to the new adventure of Kevin, now it gets stuck in the city that never sleeps and the wet bandits escaped from prison after 9 months of confinement. Things get even more complicated, since Kevin now has a credit card and a lot of money leading him to be discovered for theft. Very good family movie that, yes, is scarce in argument because in this sequel we see the same as before, but I still love it and prefer it instead of the original. Now it has new fun characters like the manager of the Plaza Hotel and the bellhop played by a nice Rob Schneider. The characters of the bandits are again super fun and even more in the classic traps of the end. They are also classic movies that Kevin sees at the hotel and plays with workers, brilliant. Again, Kevin will have a friend who will protect him in this cold environment, in this case he will be a woman who roams the Central Park and who owns many birds as he feeds them. The final message is the same family member of course, leaving us with a great movie that after its predecessor we yearn for more. ""Guess who is alone in New York this Christmas.

First rate popcorn adventure.,"Home Alone 2 tops the first Home Alone. It's even funnier and the the two burglars take an even more savage thrashing this time around from the charming and witty Kevin. It is also a more exciting movie. It makes you feel the rush that a smart young kid like Kevin (if there even are any in real life) would feel being alone in the sprawling metropolis of New York City, having the time of his life. We soon meet Harry and Marv again, but it takes a while for that inevitable moment which we eagerly anticipate of Kevin and the two Burglars bumping into each other. Kevin's final showdown with Harry and Marv takes place in an abandoned three story town house, in which he has some very nasty tricks up his sleeve to keep them at bay. This is where the movie has some minor issues. It is hard to believe how the two burglars fall for pretty much the same old tricks as they did during their first encounter with Kevin in the original. Also, at times they stand around like buffoons as Kevin sends heavy objects hurtling towards them instead of trying to dodge out of the way. Still, some of the slapstick involving Kevin's new booby traps is believable enough, not taking into account some of the physics involved and the amount of punishment Harry and Marv can take. My what troopers they are in this film.Anyway, this is solid entertainment for a lazy night in.

Excellent,"""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"" the sequel to the beloved Christmas classic, faced the daunting task of replicating the magic of its predecessor. While it may not have reached the same heights of critical acclaim, it remains a popular holiday film for many, expanding upon the original's formula with a change of scenery and a fresh set of challenges for Kevin McCallister.Once again, Kevin finds himself separated from his family during the holidays, this time due to a mix-up at the airport. Instead of Paris, he mistakenly boards a plane to New York City, armed with his father's credit card and a sense of mischievous independence. While the first film focused on defending his home, ""Lost in New York"" turns the Big Apple into Kevin's personal playground.The change of location is a significant factor in the sequel's appeal. New York City at Christmas time provides a visually stunning and festive backdrop for Kevin's adventures. From the grandeur of the Plaza Hotel to the bustling streets and the iconic Central Park, the city becomes a character in itself, offering a wealth of opportunities for both comedic and heartwarming moments.The return of Harry and Marv, the ""Wet Bandits"" (now ""Sticky Bandits""), provides a familiar threat for Kevin to contend with. Their pursuit of Kevin through the city provides the film's central conflict, leading to another series of elaborate pranks and slapstick mayhem. While some might argue that the bandits' misfortunes become repetitive, their exaggerated reactions and comedic timing continue to be a source of amusement.""Lost in New York"" also introduces new characters, most notably Mr. Duncan, the kindly toy store owner played by Eddie Bracken. This character adds a touch of sentimentality to the film, offering Kevin a sense of connection and reminding him of the true spirit of Christmas. The scenes in the toy store, particularly the heartwarming moment when Kevin pays for his Christmas gifts, are among the film's most memorable.However, the sequel does suffer from some of the pitfalls common to sequels. Some argue that the plot feels somewhat contrived, relying on the same ""left behind"" premise as the original. The level of violence in the pranks also escalates, which some viewers find excessive. While the first film balanced the slapstick with a genuine sense of vulnerability and emotional depth, the sequel sometimes prioritizes spectacle over substance.Despite these criticisms, ""Home Alone 2"" successfully captures the festive spirit of the holidays. The visuals, the music, and the overall atmosphere contribute to a sense of warmth and nostalgia. The film also reinforces the themes of family and resourcefulness that were central to the original. Kevin's journey in New York, while exaggerated, ultimately leads him to appreciate the importance of his family and the true meaning of Christmas.In conclusion, ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" may not be a perfect sequel, but it remains a fun and entertaining holiday film. The change of location, the return of the Sticky Bandits, and the introduction of new characters provide enough fresh elements to keep the story engaging. While it may not have the same timeless quality as the original, it has become a cherished part of many families' holiday traditions, offering a dose of Christmas cheer and a reminder of the importance of family.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Such an iconic Christmas movie,"A Christmas movie you honestly can't go without watching one of the Home Alone movies. I remember watching this for the first time during my childhood back in elementary school and finally decided to finally re-watch it on Christmas for the second time, and the amount of nostalgia it gave me was amazing. Like even though I only watched this for the first time during my childhood, I still remembered most of the movie and what happened. It's honestly very difficult to find any humorous Christmas movie classics or Christmas movies created in general like this one that don't over do it. It's a movie with humor, but yet emotion. Giving you a true meaning for Christmas in a sense, which is love, and to enjoy it to the fullest with those you love, thankful and not take things for granted. A movie that is truly unforgettable and personally in my opinion the best movie out of all the Home Alone movies. One with humor, emotion, and yet meaning. Of course, the first one is also amazing, and the one that started it all, both are perfect, but I would still rank this first because they honestly nailed it once again which even today is something very difficult to do when a sequel comes out or when they have to create a new story. Such a great movie & what a cast they had, especially the number of icons as well as legends they had. Truly unforgettable and always worth a watch. Of course, there are always jokes of it, like that Kevin could have always phoned the police at any time, and all his troubles would of been gone, but that's what makes this movie unique and funny. We got to experience his journey throughout all the hilarious, meaningful movies. Glad to have watched this once again, especially with my twin brother which has always been a tradition of ours to pick out a movie to watch on Christmas.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Thereis nothing particularly unique about the Home Alone series where a precocious kid (Macaulay Culkin) outsmarts some crooks and subjects them to rather painful cartoon-like violence. If anything, the violence is worse this time round. However, the setting is Christmas which gives the perfect excuse for a family-friendly soundtrack. Culkin is decent though a bit too smart while Joe Pesci brings a lot of energy to his role. This is a pleasant watch specially at home on television/DVD.Overall 6/10",,Anonymous,Crime
Two robbers could attend Olympic game!,"Basically, I like this sequel because there are some funny scenes like Kevin tip Rob Schnider a piece of gum made me laugh and the talk with pigeon woman is a warm friendship. However, the scene about punish the two robbers spoil this film because some of traps were too violence. If this happened reality, two robbers would die for example they fall from high place. After all, it's a comedy so they revived from deadly traps, so unbelivable! They strong body can make them to attend Olympic Game or new type Survivor TV program. WOW!",,Anonymous,Crime

Better than the 1st and 3rd films,"Ah, the holidays. It's a frantic time of the year, as well as a joyous occasion. Just ask the McCallister family. They mistakenly forgot or lost young Kevin (Culkin) twice, and twice Kevin had fouled two moronic burglars Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) from ruining his Christmas. ""Home Alone"" is a great holiday movie, but it's 1st and 3rd versions was not that great. However, the 1st sequel is FAR more superior than the other flicks, because, well in my opinion, it has more laughs, better performances, and a better backdrop, good old New York City, my favorite town. Mack Culkin does a way better job reprising his trademark character, plus adding more sympathetic depth to his role. Where is that kid anyway? After ""The Pagemaster"" 4 years ago, Culkin seemed to disappear after that, then a year ago, the pretty boy got married at 17 years old! I'm a teenager, maybe I should get married that young, too!",,Anonymous,Crime

"Tragedy and fear on a vaster and yet also intenser scale than the orignal, faced down by the comedy of startlingly emotive child actor, Culkin.","In Home Alone Columbus threw a child, movingly portrayed by prodigy Culkin, in debut role, into a bleak, wintrous world alone. However, it is in the sequel that the story is truly a success. Home Alone Two, far more successfully than the original, depicts a universal reality of loss and fear, and faces it with courage and hope, beautifully juxtaposing comedy against the tragedy of the piece. The success stems from three basic areas. Firstly it is in the repetition and continuity from the original piece. The premiss is the same, child loses family on Christmas, as are the actors, Culkin shining in his lead role, but with Pesci and Stern wonderfully complementing his acting and contrasting the innocence of his role with their own darkness. However, secondly, it is the progression from the orignal that makes it the greater film. The metaphor, of the first film, of the vast emptiness of each of us having to face the outside world ultimately alone is now intensified: the towering buildings of New York represent the huge power of the unknown with the winter becoming harsher, not the twee, wholesome-neighbourhood, warm white of the first film, but now a swirling blizzard against the backdrop of a dark city. Culkin is now out of his element: the fear is increased. Thirdly, it cannot be denied that Culkin's skill as an actor is responsible, to a great extent, for the perfection of the film. Culkin holds the audience in his hands. To watch him is to watch an artist, crafting his masterpiece on the screen. We fear with him, we laugh with him. Columbus gave Culkin a beautiful, simple, universal, and clearly for both he and Culkin, personal, story, and Culkin turned it into his, and Columbus', masterpiece. Home Alone Two deals with eternal issues of our lives on this earth, issues of fear, symbolised by New York in Winter and Stern's and Pesci's bleak characters, and of hope, personified by Culkin. Many may see the film as a bleak and cynical depiction of humanity, but I feel that whilst this film acknowledges the darkness in the world, ultimately through Culkin we are shown that there is hope.",,Anonymous,Crime

"Not great; not terrible; ""Home Alone 2"" is an OKAY film","Unlike the original ""Home Alone"", the situation has developed, spending longer times on the slapstick comedy of the Wet Bandits, depriving the film of its original comfort; the location. Relocating the setting to New York is an act of deprivation of the cosiness of the original. Once more, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) is cute yet a smart-aleck kid with an attitude that could challenge even the crudest of adults. He once more gets into mischief, somehow getting separated yet again from his family. Not only that, but ""Home Alone 2"" has basically the same first 10 minutes as the original, which is frustrating to re-watch. Eventually, we learn of the escape of the Wet Bandits, which has excruciatingly painful scenes for any person, let alone child. The acting is fine, with the best scenes of the film including Tim Curry as a hotel concierge, which, by the way, do not involve the bandits.With this sequel, the film has resorted to cheesy lines, exaggerated violence and repetition, as most film franchises eventually succumb to.",,Anonymous,Crime
So not annoying it's hard to believe,"Several people have said that it was a movie goof having Kevin say he's 10-years-old, and that he was really nine. They said the movie was set only a year after the original, that couldn't be possible. I mean Mac's character in my girl was 11 a year before this, and this came out 2-years after the original. I think it was a mistake that this happened a year after the first incident, that must of been the goof. I mean Kevin is so mature and not at all a hyper loudmouth, he had to be older than 9! I realized how mature and well behaved and so far from annoying he was I was like give me a break! Well I guess he had to be in order to be so precocious that he'd know how to check into The Plaza Hotel, and set up a battery of boobie traps in a four story home in NYC! lol. The movie's basically a virtual retread of the original with the violence a little more slapstick but with guns at the climax.",,Anonymous,Crime
"This time, he's in New York","This is a great sequel to the first ""Home Alone"" movie. This time we have Kevin being lost in New York after getting on the wrong plane.  I remember seeing this movie for the first time at a theater with my family.  Many of the characters in here are the same including the two burglars, Marv and Harry.  Others such as the poor woman who Kevin makes friends with and the hotel clerk played by Tim Curry(who also plays Rooster in the musical, ""Annie"") are first introduced in the series.  This movie had tons of humor and suspense.  One part I liked was where Kevin played a gangster video in his room and some of the staff came over.  They were standing out of Kevin's hotel room and thought there really was a man in there.  The gangster says ""I'll forgive you if you bend down on your knees and say you love me!""  The staff bent down and said ""I love you!"" The gangster in the movie shot at a woman and the staff thought he was really shooting at someone in the hotel room.  I haven't forgotten about Marv and Harry.  Seeing those two get into all sorts of new (and more violent) booby traps was okay, but it got to be quite painful-looking.  For example, when Marv falls through a hole and lands on the hard cement floor, he turns out to just have minor pains.  In reality of course, that would've killed him.  I think that I like this film better than the first one even though it's a bit more violent, but who cares about the violence.  It's only a movie!",,Anonymous,Crime

A low point in western civilization,"If he's lost in New York, then how exactly is he home alone? Well never mind that. I'm bothered that the filmmakers were so in love with their first Alone movie, that they decided to carbon copy it for the sequel. It's the same film in every respect, only now it features New York. What concerns me is the danger of having Home Alone become a formula, where people start pitching ideas to studios like ""Home Alone... on a bus""Actually, forget all that. All that concern fades away instantly when one considers the real problem here, which is that it seems that Hell is actually exporting feature length films for American release. How this deal was negotiated I can never know, but the unavoidable fact is that we now have a horrifying window into the land of the forsaken.I always wondered what endless torture would look like. How, for example, could one be violently beaten and killed and then instantly resurrected for another session? Look no further than the scene where Joe Pesci and the other guy fall through three stories of a building and then get up for more. They proceed to get beaten, clubbed, smacked, skinned, burned, and walloped in a manner that would make Moe, Larry and Curly beg for humanity's forgiveness.Or take for instance the scene outside the building, where Culkin, looking just as sweet and angelic as he did in the last scene of Jacobs Ladder, proceeds to lob brick after brick off the roof, where they plummet five stories and hit the burglar in the face, again and again, and again. Now I've become fairly desensitized to violence over years of TV and movie watching, but having to watch this lesson in cruelty, being so diabolically presented as banana-peel slapstick and a bad guy getting what's coming to him, just made my skin crawl.Is there any worse fate than a cherub faced boy throwing brick after brick down at you, and no matter what you do, each one will hit you full force in the face? If you've ever wanted to see what this might actually look like, it's all in Home Alone 2.The final scare here is that the other people here who have reviewed the movie have generally liked it but warned everyone to stay away from Home Alone 3, which apparently is very bad.",,Anonymous,Crime

Good slapstick comedy sequel,"OK, so, as with most sequels it wasn't quite as good as the original, but it was just as packed full of the unrealistic cruel, violent slapstick comedy we all enjoy. Macaulay Culkin put on an equally good performance as abandoned kid Kevin, and I enjoyed the twist where he used his dad's credit card to stay in a swanky hotel. And, that classic scene with the inflatable clown that scared off one of the hotel staff.",,Anonymous,Crime
Sequel is probably better than the first.,"This is probably the first time that the sequel is just as good, if not better, than the first movie. I find Home Alone 2 is a lot more exciting than Home Alone. First of all, they're in New York City! What's not to love about that? Almost every great movie is set in New York City. Next, instead of being somewhere he knows like the back of his hand, Kevin is all alone in a huge city. He has to fend for himself and make up a lot more lies than in the original, yet still gets away with them - for the most part.This movie is also a little more realistic than the first. The whole time I was watching the first movie, I was thinking, why don't the parents just call the house and talk to Kevin? I know there's a phone there. In this one, they can't reach Kevin because there's no way. They don't know which flight he got on, so that means he could be anywhere in the world. Of course, what are the chances that you're going to see the same robbers you've put away in jail last year just walking around in New York City? That was very unrealistic, but the movie's just so cute and adorable, I can forgive them for that.This movie is so sweet, and the perfect movie to watch on a Saturday night. It will undoubtedly make you finish the movie feeling a lot better than before.",,Anonymous,Crime

Not  as good as the first but way better than 3 and 4,"It was not as good as the first mainly because I did not like the Pigeon lady as much as Marley, and also in this one it was also Kevin's fault that he got lost. He could have waited to get on the plane to get the batteries. This is why I think it was also his fault that he got lost. But it was way better than the third because Kevin was in it, the story was better, all the other characters were the same, it was a continuation of the first, the acting was good, and the plot was interesting. So once again not as good as the first but way better than 3 and 4. I also liked the traps. In the third one I did not like the traps very much. I did not like the pigeon lady at all.

hughes continues his plummet,"Hughes first installment was decent up to a point, before the violence erupted.  Here he somehow was greenlighted even though he used the EXACT same script, at some times right down to dialogue used in the first film. As others have pointed out, the title is a misnomer as Culkin ends up on the wrong flight and wanders New York for a couple of days.  Some said his acting improved, I still found him stiff in his delivery, but that didn't stop Little Mac from netting 6 mil for this.  His adventures this time around are a little duller, as he basically spends money all over the place and dazzles adults with his outlook on life.  It's all filler to lead up to what the kids came for, more painful burglar bashings, even more extended and tortuous than the first movie.  How many times can these take a hit and have it be funny?  After one or two, it just gets unbelievable, and then uncomfortable.  Again, Pesci and Stern squeal their lungs out as they're dropped, slammed, electrocuted, torched, bonked, etc.  At least the gags in the first film had a shread of credibility.  Here, Hughes concocts such ridiculous means of slapstick that you roll your eyes in disbelief.  Take for instance the scene where Culkin magically (thats the only word to describe it) gets Stern to jump on a plank placed over a barrell so he can hurtle Pesci several feet into the air, and land on top of a car, smashing its windows to bits.  Or the dumbest moment that others have mentioned, when Culkin flings brick after brick from a rooftop into a dumbstruck Stern's face.  Didn't anyone on set say ""ok, come on, now this is kind of stretching it.""  This is one of the most depressing ""comedies"" to come along in awhile, that has no idea what Christmas should be about.  But more infuriating for me, is that my writing mentor Hughes has truly sunk with this crap.  Only bright spot is a terrific theme song by Darlene Love, ""All Alone on Christmas"".  Otherwise, nothing of value, except the few hundred million suckered into turning out for this waste.",,Anonymous,Crime
"A enjoyable, though suprisingly violent sequel","This film a sequel to 'Home alone' which came out 2 years earlier is more of a remake than a sequel, but is nonetheless entertaining for Kids/some adults if it isn't as good as the original. The plot is pretty much the same - The Mccalister family go on a christmas holiday yet again this time to Florida, They wake up late... again, they rush to the airport....again and yes, they leave Kevin (Culkin) behind once again but this time not at home - but at the airport, they run too fast through the building that Kevin can't catch up and ends up following who he thinks is his father but alas is not, The family go to Florida while Kevin ends up in Cold, Snowy New York city. He ends up in a upmarket hotel with his Father's credit card while the slimy concierge (Tim Curry) tries to find out more about him. along the way he meets just released burglars HARRY & MARV (played with enthusiasm once more by Joe Pesci & Daniel Stern) once again and has to foil their plan to burgle a Toy shop.Please be aware:- This sequel is more violent than it's predessesor (i.e while at least 50 feet up on a building Kevin throws a concrete brick at hits marv right on the head - In real life he would be dead - but no he faints and gets up seconds later which is a very bad example to young children who may try and copy it against their family)The snowy New York scenery is wonderful and makes you feel warm inside and has a great christmasy soundtrack. Pesci & Stern do their best as bumbling burglars. It also has a wonderful role for Irish Actress Brenda Fricker as a pidgeon woman who lives in central park. It's done with a lot of style by Chris Columbus who directed the first and has since gone on to the Harry Potter series of films, and has a pretty good screenplay by Beethoven creator John Hughes.All in all a great film for almost all the family - it may be bigger but try as they might it's no better than the firstMy rating 7/10Followed By Home alone 3 (1997) & Home Alone 4!!

Good Christmas Movie Sequel,"Such an iconic Christmas movie, a Christmas movie you honestly can't go without watching one of the Home Alone movies. I remember watching this for the first time during my childhood back in elementary school and finally decided to finally re-watch it on Christmas for the second time, and the amount of nostalgia it gave me was amazing. Like even though I only watched this for the first time during my childhood, I still remembered most of the movie and what happened. It's honestly very difficult to find any humorous Christmas movie classics or Christmas movies created in general like this one that don't over do it. It's a movie with humor, but yet emotion. Giving you a true meaning for Christmas in a sense, which is love, and to enjoy it to the fullest with those you love, thankful and not take things for granted. A movie that is truly unforgettable and personally in my opinion the best movie out of all the Home Alone movies. One with humor, emotion, and yet meaning. Of course, the first one is also amazing, and the one that started it all, both are perfect, but I would still rank this first because they honestly nailed it once again which even today is something very difficult to do when a sequel comes out or when they have to create a new story. Such a great movie & what a cast they had, especially the number of icons as well as legends they had. Truly unforgettable and always worth a watch. Of course, there are always jokes of it, like that Kevin could have always phoned the police at any time, and all his troubles would of been gone, but that's what makes this movie unique and funny. We got to experience his journey throughout all the hilarious, meaningful movies.
