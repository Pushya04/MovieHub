Comedy Special,"Maybe back then you couldn't tell what would become of Jonah Hill eventually (an Oscar nominated actor, playing with/against Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio) ... actually if you told anyone back then this would happen, they'd have written that in the script, because it would have sounded hilarious.Speaking of hilarious: That's something that can be said about this movie. Of course many will start comparing this with American Pie, Porkys and what not. But the movie stands on its own two feet and has been copied a lot itself. Never to that success and never as good as ""Superbad"" obviously. If you like your teen comedies to be raunchy and dirty, this is exactly your cup of tea.

Hilarious Jonah Hill and the nerdy Michael Cera,"Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) are high school best friends and nerdy outsiders. It's almost the end of high school, and they're going their separate ways. Their weird friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) claims to be getting a fake ID. Seth is hot for friendly Jules (Emma Stone). When Jules invites Seth to her party, he volunteers to buy the booze. He's counting on Fogell to get the alcohol, but his fake ID name says McLOVIN.I love the friendship between Jonah Hill and Michael Cera. Jonah is the break out star. He is hilariously loud. And McLOVIN will forever live on. For these and so much more, this movie is crazy funny.The only problem is that Officer Slater (Bill Hader) and Officer Michaels (Seth Rogen) are way too silly. They're drawing focus away from the kids. It's a mistake. The movie is about the kids. They should be the ones doing stupid things. They should be the ones having the hilarities. The cops should be more straight. That way it would be more relatable, and much more funny.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The Last Great American Comedy Film,"The Good:In the spirit of a horny teenage boy awkwardly confessing his love to his crush of forever, I'm just going to list everything I love about this comedy classic.The ambiguous time period. Superbad looks, sounds, and feels like the 1970s (hence the title), with warm browns and oranges, a grainy ""shot-on-film"" feel, and a killer funk inspired soundtrack. Yet, it's clearly a movie set in the 2000s, with the cellphones, and the PS2s and the cars in the background. It's almost as if the movie is sub-communicating how timeless it would eventually become. Which, whether intentional or not, is telling as to how brilliant this raunchy, vulgar comedy truly is.Jonah Hill and Michael Cera's chemistry in this film is UNREAL. They sound, act, and feel like actual friends and the reality that they've never done another movie together sort of propels their dynamic in this film to LEGENDARY status. There's nothing to compare them to really; they are one of cinema's all time duos in this one, perfectly balancing off one another.It calls back to another amazing aspect of this film; how realistic the teenagers look and act in this film. Clearly everyone is in their mid 20s, but most of the teens look like seniors on the cusp of graduation. More than that, they ACT realistically. One thing American high school films always get wrong is the ""clique."" They're really not as rigid as films and TV portray; people frequently talk to, hang out with, and befriend people outside of their clique on a regular basis. Superbad nails how high school isn't a straightforward tribal hierarchy. It's a web of relationships.I know that sounds like a weird thing to praise this movie for, but it all culminates in one of the best party montages I've seen put to film. It's super satisfying not just to see our heroes finally get to the Promised Land, but for it to be a party filled with generally realistic people. It harkens back to parties I went to back in the day; maybe that's why this movie speaks to me so much.Speaking of realism, this film managed to impact pop culture going forward with the inclusion of the iconic Christopher Mintz-Plasse as McLovin. It's kind of appropriate he came and went; I'd be surprised if he could ever top this role, to be honest. A testament to exceptional casting throughout this film, there's no one else I could imagine possibly being McLovin than this dude.What else can I say? The writing is basically perfect, with so many jokes crammed into this that you can watch it dozens of times and still find new things to laugh at. The performances are top notch from absolutely everyone, whether they're minor characters or romantic interests. The movie's real message about friendship and growing up is unbelievably heart warming.AND THAT ENDING. Would anyone have expected a movie about two horny teenage boys trying to deliver alcohol to a party for the express purposes of getting laid to end like this? For it to tug at your heart strings and wish there was another movie right after? I don't think so.Bad: It's Super.The Ugly: I'm going to say it. Superbad is probably the last great American comedy film. There have been good comedies since, for sure, but do any of them even come close to Superbad? It'll be 15 years in 2022 since this movie came out, and honestly, it hasn't been topped. All hail the baddest of them all.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Impressive,"Normally I don't like this kind of film about teenagers trying to act like adults, but this film really works. It is funny, it has brotherhood, friendship and romance all in one.

Holy Crap This Movie Was Amazing!!!!,"Okay, so today i went to an advanced screening of this movie. It was really last minute and I didn't know much about it other than it was from the makers of The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up and it looked pretty funny.I expected it to be funny, but my expectations were blown out of the water. It was extremely smart and pretty much believable. Well, some of the situations are a little ridiculous, but what's a good comedy without a little nonsense? But the characters were all so awesome.There were a few parts where i was a little uncomfortable. There are some pretty explicit drawings in it so you might not want to see it with younger siblings or parents. But I'm telling you, this movie was super funny.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Incredibly funny comedy,"Superbad is an incredibly funny comedy that's heartwarming, hilarious and shocking. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera are incredible and have amazing chemistry. Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Emma Stone are great. Seth Rogen and Bill Harder are perfect, consistently hilarious throughout but unfortunately steal every scene even when they're not supposed to. Greg Mottola's direction is great, it's well filmed and well paced. The music by Lyle Workman and the soundtrack are both really good.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Supergood,"Coming of age films typically come through rose tinted glasses of the teenage years in modern America. Superbad holds back no punches and embraces the awkward, cringey phases that everyone goes through as they try to fit in. The cast excel at their roles and each actor makes the story feel more fun and exciting. Everyone works so well off of each other and that makes their jokes land harder almost every time. With so many iconic jokes and quotable lines, this film buries itself in your brain and checks in for life. Though the edgy, teenage humor has been done thousands of times since 2007, Superbad still feels fresh and still captures laughs and relatability from new and repeat viewers.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Super Bad"" is very funny, but had the potential to be a great movie too","""Super Bad"" is great until the moment the two policemen appears, from that scene it stop being clever to become just a funny movie that is only looking for the easy laugh (like most of the comedies we are used to watch), that is not a bad thing, I like that kind of comedy too, but the problem is that ""Super Bad"" promised much more of what it finally delivers, it could been the best teen boys comedy movie ever, which dealt with the boys interest in the opposite sex. I think this movie deserves an average of 6.8 stars.The star of the film is Jonah Hill who is very good as the smart ass Seth (who is very funny making jokes and comments), on the other hand I didn't like the character Evan, this character is so annoying (he could haven been made not so naive). Christopher Mintz-Plasse was great playing the Fogell character, I enjoyed every moment he was on screen because he is very funny in a rare way like mr bean.The plot is about two best friends Seth and Evan with a secondary character Fogell who have their last chance to lose their virginity at a party before going to the university. They will have to face problems taking a lot of beer to the party in order to have sex with pretty girls.I recommend watching it because is very funny, despite the two policemen characters who are funny too but the didn't belong to this film.

Supergood Millennials Coming of Age Film,"A lot can happen in 24 hours when two best-buddy co-dependent outlier H/S Seniors get an invite to the ""big party"".

Surprisingly Hilarious,"I was able to catch a screening of 'Superbad' last night in NYC and I was very pleased with the movie. I'm sure most will compare this to an 'American Pie' like comedy, but it's so much more than that. There were some ""shock value"" moments, but very well done to tip the scale more to funny than to gross.It is a teen movie, so 'Superbad's plot is obviously basic. It's the performances of the 3 friends (Seth, Evan, and 'McLovin' Fogell) that really make it great. I am big Michael Cera fan thanks to the brilliant TV series ""Arrested Development"", and other fans will be delighted to see his equally hilarious performance as Evan. The movie has the sexually driven banter and gross outs that will appeal to 'American Pie' viewer and the smart timing and acting that will appeal to the 'Arrested Development' viewer. What was really surprising to me was the touching (platonic) relationship that Evan and Seth have. Also, 'McLovin' Fogell, is an absolute nerdy delight.The only negative thing I noticed that it was a bit drawn out toward the middle, but it really picks up after. Overall it's a great time and might just be a success at the box office. Bad teen comedies are a dime a dozen, but 'Superbad' is a shiny golden egg!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The most ambitious teen rompcom I've ever seen,"Yes, it's funny. It's silly, it's crass, it's irreverant, and it has all the makings of a mindless adolescent farce like the ones I grew up with from American Pie to Revenge of the Nerds and all their sequels. But when this movie ended and the credits rolled I was left speechless in awe. And not just because of all the penis drawings during the credits.""Superbad"" is, as you may expect from any film produced by Judd Apatow (40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, etc), on the raunchy side. So don't be surprised if you see a penis drawing or 2. But what makes this an amazing film is that despite all the raunchiness and partying and horseplay it actually delivers some powerful human and sentimental themes.In the hands of an inferior cast, it would have flopped and come across as cheesy. But with these actors, each delivering a larger than life performance despite playing high school seniors, it's magnificent. I'll give you just 1 example of what I'm talking about...There's a scene where 2 characters are gearing up for a sexual encounter (their first). But one of them (and arguably both) are not ready for it. Unlike all the teen romps that I grew up with, where the goal is for the guy to bed the girl, this scene makes us put the brakes on and consider: Wait... Why is the goal always for the guy to bed the girl?? And at the same time it's really funny and does not sacrifice the film's momentum. I won't ruin the ending of the scene, but let's just say it's satisfying on every level and punctuated with a great gag to make us laugh.""Superbad"" is truly an evolution of the genre. It's every bit as crass and wacky and full of horseplay as all the others since Porky's, but this is the first time one of these mindless comedies dares to make us think and feel on a deeper level. Like I said, it's largely due to the great casting. Michael Cena, if you're not familiar, plays his signature role of an awkward deer-in-the-headlights kid but with a strong sense of who he is, even though nobody else seems to understand. Jonah Hill plays his best friend, sort of the antithesis: a loser who thinks he knows what he wants but he's really quite confused. Emma Stone knocks it out of the park with a great role that's quirky, cool, rebellious and responsible all at the same time. Rounding out the troupe are Bill Hader and Seth Rogan who play a pair of despicable yet loveable cops whose combined IQ is around the same as their blood alcohol level.This flick has it all. It's definitely for mature audiences in terms of language (at least the unrated cut I watched), but ironically it has some great messages for teens and younger viewers, if you can see through the tomfoolery. There aren't many films I can compare this to, but if you've seen ""Easy A"" with Emma Stone (somewhat tamer than this), I'd say ""Superbad"" has the same vibe. A seemingly silly teen comedy that packs a serious punch under the surface.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Superbad is an uneven teen-sex comedy that still entertains,"After about a month of playing theatres, I finally got to see Superbad with my friend after seeing the other movies that had come out that we wanted to see. My friend liked it though he thought it had too much profanity. I didn't have a problem with the language but I did think the funny stuff came in little doses between several scenes that dragged. I liked the performances of Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, and Chris Mintz-Plasse as the high school seniors trying to get laid two weeks before graduation as well as the slacker cops played by Bill Hader and the movie's co-writer Seth Rogen. But their performances weren't enough to make this a hilariously funny movie like I usually expect from producer Judd Apatow who had no hand in writing this movie like he had in his previously very funny directorial outings, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. Still, despite its unevenness, Superbad does get points for making the main characters' growing pains seem real and for getting the potential girlfriends of Hill and Cera not seem like such sluts...",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Do not go in with high expectations ...,"Before I watched this movie I checked its IMDb rating and was convinced by 30,000 IMDb users that the movie was 8.4/10. This put it ahead of Scarface, The Princess Bride, and The Big Lebowski on the top 250 movies list. In my opinion Superbad is no where near as good as any of these 3 movies.SUPERBAD is not SUPERGOOD. It's not even good. At best it's 6/10.Superbad is not groundbreaking in its material. Superbad does not flow well at all and is veeeeerrrryyy drawn out in lots of places. I think American Pie was much funnier, with more action, and with better character interactions.But perhaps it was just my high expectations. However, when a movie rates higher than a movie like The Big Lebowski, my expectations go through the roof.I will concede that Jonah Hill was brilliant in patches, but he had some scenes that were so stupid they more than offset the good ones.Conclusion: Average comedy that shouldn't rate on the top 250 list amongst the classics.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious and also in many ways heartwarming.,"This movie is one of the funniest of the 21st century. The jokes are hilarious, and it is spoken by a great cast. Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Seth Rogen, and others are excellent in their roles. The characters they play you really latch on to you. They are extremely likable in many ways. The dialogue is also superb. It's a fast moving script that gives many great lines by the end of the movie. Also at the end I sorta felt some happiness. It's one thing to make me laugh throughout, but to make a vulgar comedy like this actually make my heart warm is a very big plus. It's a film about friendship, and that message manages to find its way through all the vulgar stuff.4 stars out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funniest Movie I've Seen In A Long Time,"I got to see an advanced screening the other night, complete with an interview with the cast. I figured this movie could go either way, especially when you consider ""40 year-old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" were funny and entertaining, but they weren't exactly loved by all.I am happy to say this movie was wonderful. The jokes are crude, but dead on, and unlike recent movies with a similar style, like ""Clerks 2,"" the plot moves on without any real downtime (you know, where the plot slows the progress of humor and you find yourself checking your watch). Jonah Hill and Michael Cera have that best friend chemistry that this movie required as well as being dead on with their jokes. The real star of the movie, however, was newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who took the role of Fogell and OWNED it. I got the chance to chat with the actors and I was not only surprised to hear that both Mintz-Plasse and Michael Cera are 18 and 19 respectively.For the type of movie this is and the brilliant script that Seth Brogen has presented, there is no reason why anyone, young or old, can't relate to this off-the-wall comedy. See this movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The name says it all.,"I would have given ""Superbad"" a 3 out of 10, but the sweetness and authenticity of the friendship between Seth and Evan gives it some redeeming qualities. ""McLovin"" steals the show, of course, and if he gets his own movie, I hope it doesn't ruin the painful attraction I feel towards his character. If you were ever unpopular, or a nerd in school, you will feel pains of sympathy as he stumbles through the movie without ever realizing how cringe-worthy his behaviour is.That being said, the rest of the movie is an extended penis joke with a few comments about vaginas thrown in for variety. It comes as no surprise that one of the main characters has a past obsession with drawing penises. Obviously autobiographical for Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, as they never seem to have lost their single-mindedness for genitals.If you are a teenage boy, you'll love the crude humor. If you're not in this demographic, skip the movie, or at least wait for DVD. Don't be fooled by the reviews noting how ""touching"" the pairs' friendship is. It's only surprising that there is actual emotion displayed in a movie so otherwise devoid of it.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One teenage comedy with extra wit and soul,"Superbad is a parable of values and friendship, reminding us that a good and earnest moral upbringing will be able to safely glide us through life and make us achieve happiness much easier. Its characters are well-mannered and sweet, not to mention inherently likable, as well as everything being morally correct and admirable.Now onto the real review. Superbad is a shamelessly raunchy R-rated comedy with more four letter words than a Webster dictionary. Again, this sounds like the introduction I'd give a poorly rated film. By no means is Superbad a bad comedy. It is a smart, witty, and factual teen movie side-stepping clichés and underwritten primary characters, while at the same time remaining funny and entertaining until the end.2007 was the year where Judd Apatow took off. He gained attention in 2005 with The 40 Year Old Virgin, but pretty much garnered a household name with this and Knocked Up, both starring Seth Rogen. It wouldn't surprise me to hear that Superbad is an autobiography, since the writers of the film, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, share the same names as the lead actors. Maybe that could be why this feels so sentimental and close to home. Or maybe it's because Superbad is aware what kind of unsettling situations high school can put you through and knows how to document them in a fun way.The film centers around loudmouth pervert Seth (Hill) and self-conscious, paranoia-stricken Evan (Cera) as they endure their last few weeks of being high schoolers before they are shipped off to separate colleges. Seth and Evan have been friends for years, and are tired of the fact that their separate ways have been the talk of their parents and friends.Seth has a crush on the recently-popular Jules (Stone), a beautiful redhead, who trusts him with supplying alcohol for her party. Evan has a crush on Becca (MacIsaac), a sweet and simple girl who agrees to meet up with him at Jules' upcoming party as well. In order to purchase the alcohol, both Seth and Evan trust their pal Fogel (Mintz-Plasse), who plans to acquire a fake ID. Because of this ID, Fogel now becomes his fake name, ""McLovin,"" a name that has garnered much fame on the web.The night unfolds into a chaotic spectacle of unprecedented stature, so much so that I won't go into explaining the routes and acts of desperation the characters take in order to be liked, admired, or even noticed. Fogel winds up teaming up with two police officers (Hader and Rogen) who act more like the bad guys rather than good guys. This setup and sort of topsy-tursvy treatment of character roles create limitless comedic possibilities, most of which are well utilized.But what truly makes the film work is its level of realism and intelligence. It has wit, and puts it to use. The writing and acting captures the awkwardness of the teenage lifestyle with pinpoint accuracy, at the same time makes it fun and painful to witness. I can think of quite a few films that allow their characters to thrive on ego and self-interest, with no redeeming qualities. Here, the characters in Superbad just want to fit in and achieve the girl of their dreams, but shallow stereotypes and one stutter too many prevent this goal from happening.Superbad is quite a rarity; a funny, good-natured comedy focusing on things of the immoral nature. Just like with American Pie, too many people believe these films are just raucous sex comedies with no substance, soul, or charm. The characters are likable and charismatic, and lack the oh-so-typical nihilistic, ""I just want to have sex with anything that moves"" mentality. Some may be surprised at the level of nuanced emotional instances the film reaches. The performances are fun, the writing is polished and witty, and the antics never seem to go over the top. It's too bad the women roles in the film feel a tad underwritten. Hopefully we have something like Supergood to explore that angle sometime soon.Starring: Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Bill Hader, Seth Rogen, Emma Stone, and Martha MacIsaac.

Absolutely hilarious!!!,"I have been lucky enough to see two advanced screenings of Superbad in Burbank. It is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time.

My love for Michael Cera's performance in Arrested Development drove me to the theater and man was I glad I went. This is not your typical high school comedy. The writing is much smarter and funnier and the acting is superb. This movie so far transcends American Pie and its ilk that it cannot really even be compared. Go see this movie!!!

Not SuperBad but not SuperGood neither,"When I went to see this movie, I was in a great need for a laugh... I wanted a ludicrous, fast-paced teen movie packed with intelligent (I would even accept tacky) jokes. That was not what I got...Instead what I got was a solid script, with credible characters and situations. It is even an interesting depiction of teenage-life stereotypes (although short as such). I may admit some of scenes may please a young audience (clearly much younger than I am), but most of them didn't cause me more than an amused smile or even a smirk. The worse thing is that such scenes were followed by long periods of plain situations.Thus I think there is way too much hype going on about the movie, as it fails as a serious movie (which it is not supposed to be) and it is not sufficiently demented to cause more than the occasional giggle... and that was not what I wanted.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Best Teen Comedy Since the Original ""American Pie!""","Well, I just got back from the Superbad screening tonight (thanks to the folks at MySpace) and I must say that this is a very special teen movie. It has that same element of transporting you back to your high school days that the original American Pie had. Michael Cera does great as the awkward teenage kid, basically a reprise of his role as George Michael on Arrested Development. But it is Jonah Hill who absolutely rules this movie! He had me laughing from the beginning to the end. His ""silly fat-kid"" character is the only one in the history of movies that shows what it truly feels like to be the funny fat kid in high school. I should know, I was one! Gosh, I just can't believe how well he portrayed the unmitigated hell that was P.E.! Emma Stone and Martha Maclsaac also give very realistic depictions of teenage girls. None of that fake, over the top nonsense. The most over-the-top character was ""McLovin"" himself, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who did a great job of having us laugh with him as much as we did at him.All in all, I think that everyone should be sure to watch this movie when it comes later this summer.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not my cup of tea but a good teen comedy nonetheless - 76%,"I've never been a huge fan of the teen comedy genre, primarily because they are all essentially the same. Bunch of hopeless losers get together and have a wild, crazy adventure in search of sex, drugs and/or drink. ""Superbad"" sticks rigidly to this formula so in essence, this is no different to ""American Pie"", ""Porkys"", ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" or any other teen flick you could mention. But seeing as it features Hollywood's form actor - Seth Rogen - not only on screen but also on the screenplay, I figured that maybe this might have something to it. And to be fair, there are some laughs to be had and the unfamiliar cast certainly do themselves a power of good but personally, this isn't my cup of tea.Best friends Seth (Johan Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) have been inseparable throughout high school and are preparing to spend their last few weeks together before separating for college. But after a chance invitation to a party, Seth hatches a plan for them to provide the party with enough booze in order for them to get it on with two girls (Martha MacIsaac & Emma Stone). Roping in fellow geek Foggell (newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and his fake ID, their plan quickly unravels after two inept cops (Rogen & Bill Hader), a homeless drunk and Foggell's bizarre new identity (McLovin) threaten to scupper their plans. Can they get hold of the booze? Can they get to the party and pop their cherry? And when will Hollywood change the record?It's unfair to judge ""Superbad"" on sticking so close to the teen comedy stereotype because that's what it is - a teen comedy. So it's packed to the rafters with all the crude language, sex jokes and two dimensional eye candy in miniskirts you'll ever need. What ""Superbad"" has in reserve is what separates it from the seemingly never-ending supply of teen flicks spewing from Hollywood. First, it has a killer cast. They isn't a weak link in the chain anywhere, although all three leads are shown up by Rogen and Hader who are simply brilliant as the completely hopeless cops. There is also a surprisingly epic feel to the thing, like a juvenile ""Lord Of The Rings"" as their supposedly simply quest gets ever more convoluted and impossible. But there is also a sting in the tail, an ending that was not only heartfelt but plausible too.So while it doesn't bring anything new to the party, ""Superbad"" is still welcome all the same. It wasn't the laughter-fest I was expecting but like I said, I'm not a fan of this type of film. If you enjoyed ""American Pie"" or any of its witless sequels then I suspect you'll get more out of this than I did. I just wish that something would come along and not rely on massive amounts of swearing and revolve around a bunch of losers trying to get laid - is that really too much to ask? Maybe ""Pineapple Express"" might appeal to me more but I'm not in any great rush to see that either. All I can say is give ""Superbad"" a chance but only if this sort of malarkey appeals to your teenage sense of humour.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Excellent, hilarious teen movie with likable characters, for a change.","Superbad is a teen movie. It also will draw comparisons to American Pie, in it's ""losers try to get laid"" themes, and occasional gross-out comedy. But the comparison is unfair - Superbad is a funnier, more subversive and more importantly genuine movie than American Pie or any of it's awful sequels were. The three central characters have a believable, likable relationship, that the film takes time to establish. Cera, Hill (who deserves special praise, for turning what could have been a really unlikeable character into a sweet, if loud-mouthed and crass, teenager) and Mintz-Plasse bounce of each other perfectly. The movie creates some funny situations, and more importantly, hilarious dialogue throughout. Aside from one comedic misfire - an overly long (and poorly judged) gross out sight gag involving a pair of trousers and a dance - Superbad had me laughing constantly. It's sweet, it's funny as hell, and it's established a load of new talent.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
an extended barrage of brainless fun,"Taking its cue from the burgeoning geek vogue, Superbad audiences will get what they came in for: an extended barrage of brainless fun.When they were still 13 years old, Seth Rogen (Knocked Up) and Evan Goldberg wrote the screenplay about two high school seniors, aptly named Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera), who are at a crossroads in their lives: slacker Seth will not be going to the same college as the more studious Evan, who will be going to Dartmouth. The boys deal with their separation anxiety on top of managing to get some illegally-obtained booze for a party they have miraculously been invited to by the girls of their dreams.Seth Rogen also appears as Officer Michaels and Bill Hader as Officer Slater, who somehow get embroiled after stumbling in on the hilarious attempt of Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) to buy the booze with a fake ID posing as 'McLovin'.If you plan to enjoy this flick, leave all pretensions at the door. Superbad is what it is: the jokes are crass, but spot on.

Definitely the best Apatow-group film yet,"I enjoyed ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" but didn't feel it was entirely worthy of all the enormous acclaim it garnered. And for all the praise ""Knocked Up"" received, I thought it was fairly average. So I wasn't expecting much from ""Superbad."" However, I'd have to say it's the smartest and funniest Apatow film yet. I know he didn't direct it, but his influence is distinct. And in the past I've felt indifferent towards Apatow's brand of humour, but combined with Rogen's sensitivity towards the teen condition here, it works really well.People have compared it to John Hughes' better teen comedies, but I don't think the approach is entirely similar. ""Superbad"" is cruder, ruder, a bit more focused on the sex & alcohol jokes. But it works really well because it captures that dynamic - better than ""American Pie"" because it invests more care into its characters. One of the strengths of ""Pie"" over other films in its genre (such as, say, ""Slackers"") has always been its characters, and ""Superbad"" similarly relies on its characters for support. Plus, it's just really funny.The performances all around are pretty funny, even if the Fogell/McLovin pop culture references are ruining a good joke (kind of like ""Yeah, baby!!"" ruined Austin Powers when 20-year-old frat boys around the country thought it would be funny to shout the phrase every five seconds).Jonah Hill and Michael Cera have great chemistry and another one of the strengths of this film is that its teenage characters actually do look their age (even though Hill is in his early 20s, he still passes as a senior). But it was Bill Hader and Seth Rogen who stole the show for me as the clueless cops.Overall this is just a funny, well-made film with heart. It doesn't mock its characters or their predicaments but casts a knowing eye on the high school experience. It captures all this very well and was certainly, in my opinion, far superior to ""Knocked Up.""",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the best comedies of the year,"Superbad may look like a typical high-school movie on the cover, but its actually much more. It follows a trio of high-school seniors that decide to have one last party before leaving for college (and one last shot at grabbing a girl). The trio consists of Seth, Evan, and Fogell. They make a likable main cast that is very easy to compare to. Their acting style is ideal for this type of film. Joining them are several other intriguing characters. My favorite were the two police officers, Slater and Michaels. Pretty much every scene with them made me laugh; from their references to other movies to the spoofs on being an officer, its classic slapstick comedy.The plot is definitely a strong point, unlike many comedies today. Most of the movie follows two distinct plot lines that join up at the end. Inter-weaved in the plot are countless jokes that kept me laughing almost the whole time. The plot itself involves booze, partying, and law enforcement, and somehow works these in to make a very absorbing story. Also, the particularly close friendship between Seth and Evan is an element that surpasses the comedy genre. The plot as a whole has plenty of unrealistic details, but manages to successfully meld comedy with some deeper meaning.The comedy aspects are some of the best ever. Some of the jokes were a little disgusting (mainly the part about Seth's childhood), but I gotta admit they were hilarious. The beer aspects were pretty cool, and the sexual jokes did their thing. The law enforcement spoofs and McLovin gags were probably my favorite.The movie as a whole is among the better comedies ever. I liked it more than Knocked Up (7/10). It still suffers from some of the weaknesses inherent in the comedy genre, but has a lot more value than most movies nowadays. Highly recommended for people in high school or college, and also recommended (albeit to a lesser degree) for everyone else.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Superbad,"Even though in my opinion Judd Apatow's output as director and producer has been quite uneven, there are funny movies to be found in his body of work. His 2007 production Superbad directed by Greg Mottola tells the story of three high schoolers who are about to graduate in a few weeks. Wishing to have a great time before moving out to different colleges, Seth and Evan (Jonah Hill and Michael Cera) manage to get themselves invited to a party hosted by girls they like, provided that they bring plenty of alcohol with them. Easier said than done; all their attempts at buying liquor go wrong in unexpected ways, leading to a series of more or less unfortunate events involving the duo's geeky friend Fogell, also known as ""McLovin"" (Christopher Mintz-Plasse).At first the movie doesn't seem too great; the crass sex dialog and obsession about getting wasted feel like they have been done in hundreds of high school movies already. Luckily the story picks up later on when the guys get their epic quest for booze started. The references to movies and other pop culture products are amusing and the funk and rock music on the soundtrack is very groovy, but the best jokes are delivered by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader as the laid-back cops Michaels and Slater, who just won't let anything distract them from having a fun night while on duty. During the party scene at the end, the movie feels like it's again dragging and trusting the teen sex comedy clichés too much, but ultimately the ending turns out alright.Rogen and Hader overshadow the main actors quite heavily, but I also liked Hill's performance as the chubby and superficially bold but secretly insecure Seth. Mintz-Plasse's Fogell learning to have fun 'in a manly way' is fairly amusing too. However, the other actors don't succeed quite as well; so far I haven't really been impressed by Michael Cera in the admittedly few roles I've seen him in, and Superbad is no exception. He just seems so uncharismatic that a movie based on his screen persona just isn't going to be very strong. The actresses playing the girls (Martha MacIsaac, Emma Stone et al.) don't manage to make their characters very memorable either. Still, the story's drama element about Seth and Evan's lasting friendship is alright and has its place in a movie like this, even if the adversities in their bromance come across as a bit by-the-numbers.When all is said and done, Superbad shouldn't let down the fans of other Apatow productions, and there are many entertaining jokes for everyone else too; particularly Seth's penis drawings are pretty creative and worth seeing, if that kind of humour is your thing. The movie may not a comedic bullseye, but it's an adequately crass entertainer anyway.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Arguably the best comedy of all time,"I'm writing this review 16 years after its initial release. Watching it again for like the 10th time but it's been years. This movie is filled with quotes and funny one liners that will never ever get old. The dynamic trio of Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, and Christopher Mintz Plasse is just classic. Their on screen chemistry is great and their character each had their unique personalities that made them equally as likeable and funny. If you're like me, and you lived out those wild and rebellious teenage years drinking and putting yourself in stupid situations then this movie hits even harder. Literally reminds me a bit of me and my friends group. Anyways, it's my favorite comedy ever and one of the only movies I'll rate above a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The clue is in the name ;o),"I first watched 'Superbad' and I didn't like it much. In short: totally forgettable. It was only as the years went by did I realise quite how much of a 'cult following' it had, so I decided to give it another go. I have to say that it gets better each time I watched it. I can only assume I was in the mood for something a little more serious and 'high-brow' when I initially sat down. However, now I know what I'm getting, I'm quite happy to watch and rewatch it every few years. Think 'American Pie' only less intellectual!It's difficult not to mention the (sort of) 'ground breaking' 'American Pie' film when talking about 'Superbad.' Any story that centres around young High School-age lads who are on a quest to - er - 'get better acquainted' with members of the opposite s3x in a short period of time, will always draw comparisons with the 'Pie' franchise. Here, we have three boys (Jonah Hill as 'Seth,' Michael Cera as his best mate 'Evan' and Christopher Mintz-Plasse stealing every scene as 'Fogell' (or rather 'McLovin' I should say). They are the archetypal nerds who never really know what to say around girls and are reduced to working out ways to 'trick' the fairer s3x into liking them during a graduation party before they all leave for college (that's 'University' to us Brits!).Naturally, their plot doesn't go to plan and what follows is everything from singing (badly!) in front of drug dealers, to throwing Molotov cocktails at police cars - so you typical night out when you were about 18. It's all in very bad taste and if you're in any way offended by s3xual-related gags, swearing and generally 'adult' situations and humour then you should stay well clear. However, if you're in the mood for something pretty low-brow then you'll definitely find it here.I liked the relationship between Seth and Evan. Yes, it's hard to make stereotypical 'nerds' that different from any other depiction you've already seen, but they certainly have chemistry and you do feel as if they would be the type to hang out together in real life. They're flawed and not totally 'heroic,' but then aren't we all? In short - they're relatable. However, as I mentioned it's Christopher Mintz-Plasse who is the real star of the film. His character gets separated from the other two early on and has his own little adventure with a couple of... well, not exactly corrupt, but also hardly 'untouchable' police officers, played by Seth Rogan and Bill Hader. Somehow, everything about this completely mismatched pairing of cops and nerd works and is a true joy to behold. As I eluded to, it helped cement 'McLovin' as a term/name we all know and love.Personally, for me 'Superbad' is up there with those few films that I really didn't like on first watch and yet I totally changed my opinion after time ('Anchorman' is another, curiously). I'm not sure if this experience resonates with anyone else, but all I can say is that it's dumb, rude and - yes - super 'bad' ('bad' being slang for good in today's youth - so I'm told).",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"amazing cast, hilarious script, what else could you ask for?","i am a 13 year old from the UK so if this review isn't professional, don't judge me.Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and Christopher Mintz-Plasse did an amazing job on this film. they all took on characters which you would expect to see from their look. also Seth Rogen and Bill Hader did a great job of the cops. they weren't serious like most cops are in teen movies (American Pie 2) i gave the film a 9 out of 10 because i think the film could of used Paul Rudd instead of Joe Lo Truglio as the nervous yet hyper older guy.all in all it is a great film which you can watch again and again and still laugh like it is the first time.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I'm Mclovin it,"This movie is very crude and crass with very frank language, but that's what makes it clever and better than recent films in this genera. The conversation the guys have about girls and dating sounded like something you would really hear close friends talk about in private. Things like that are what made it very funny. Seth and Evan are two high school seniors whom generally don't get invited to parties. But, Jules the girl Seth likes is having a party and after overhearing they have a fake ID to get alcohol invites them to her party. Their buddy Fogell, aka Mclovin, is the one with the ID, so the rest of the movie involves what happens when Mclovin goes to a liquor store to purchase alcohol and then their attempt to make it to the party. About everything that can go wrong does.The cops were a hoot. They take Mclovin to a bar, let him play with a gun, and drink on the job. I hope the real police don't act like that. And Seth and Evan have their own problems, they keep getting hit by cars and wind up at a party where cocaine is involved and get into fights.All 3 finally make it to Jules' party. Do Seth and Evan get the girls they pine for? Could this movie get any more vulgar? Watch to find out.FINAL VERDICT: If you think vulgar, crass teen films are very funny, then you will like this.

"Hilarious, gross, yet smart movie","Superbad was an absolutely hilarious film. There were so many mind bogglingly hilarious one-liners in the film that I will need to watch it again to see which ones I missed while I was laughing. This is one movie that I will definitely watch every time they rerun it on cable in the future. It had its completely gross-out teen moments, but those were grounded by its hilariously absurd and witty (also gross) conversations. Michael Cera was great, and most Arrested Development fans should find his performance here just as entertaining as his take on the George Michael character he played on that show. He is absolutely awkward and downright hilarious. Jonah Hill is the funniest he has ever been, confidently spouting out uproariously funny lines at every hot girl in sight.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Supertrash,"A friend of mine loved this movie so I thought I'd give it a try. This film ain't 'Superbad' but it's 'Supertrash'. Trying to be like the 'American Pies' and other teen sex comedies, this one failed to make much of an impression and I don't get what all the gah-gah is about. The first 45 minutes is full of cheap sex jokes that are not even funny. Had Kevin Smithdirected the film he might have done a better job. 'Superbad' slightly picks up when the two goofy CCs (corrupt cops) are introduced and here it goes (or tries to go) the 'Dude, Where's My Car Way' but eventually the cheap sex-jokes catch up and bring it down by a huge notch. I would have turned it off after 15 minutes but I was struck by Martha MacIsaac's beauty. Her screen time is limited but the film seemed to take a better turn once the coppers were introduced (but alas!). Anyway, i'll get to the technical stuff. Grdg Mottola tries hard to pull an 'American Pie' meets 'Dude Where's My Car' (and some other teen stuff) but he fails. Jonah Hill gives an irritating performance of an annoying character. Michael Cera is pretty much George Michael Bluthe (of 'Arrested Development' fame) but he's the only one who manages to make his character somewhat likable. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is alright as the transforming geek. Bill Hader and Seth Rogan are okay too. Martha MacIsaac and Emma Stone are eye-candy. What else is there to say? The second half is only mildly better than the torturous first. However, overall it's a poor movie. One of the most overrated trash of 2007.",,Anonymous,Comedy

It's the opposite of the name...,"Supergood or Superfunny is a much more appropriate title for this movie, because it really is. As far as teen comedies go, it is arguably the best of the lot.The plot is a little simple and has been used in many films before. Teens go on a hunt to obtain booze and girls etc. The unrelenting friendship between the two young men is sweet. The dialogue is expertly written and performed.It's a rather lowbrow film, but that doesn't stop it from being hilarious at all. I will confess that the cops made me completely crack up at times, my favourite role of Seth Rogen.The cast fits the bill perfectly, such great chemistry, and it's something of a shame there wasn't a sequel, but in a way it wasn't really a film that needed one.It's one of the funniest films of the 2000s without a doubt and is easily worth a watch if you're up for a laugh.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Much better than the usual teen comedy,"I always heard a lot of buzz about 'Superbad', apparently one of the best teen comedies of the last few years. Yet, as pretty much every film in that genre, the plot is merely a bunch of teens obsessing over partying, alcohol and sex (no drugs this time around, thankfully). How could this be any different?I finally saw this film, and it was a somewhat pleasant surprise. The dialogue is the true highlight here: it is not forced, flowing easily and being funny without trying hard (Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg are often hit-or-miss, and in here they succeed more often than not). It manages to be crude at times without upsetting, particularly in the cop scenes; however, some of the buddy dialogue between Jonah Hill and Michael Cera towards the end tends to get overly sappy and not funny at all.There is not too much buffoonery like in 'American Pie' or other teen comedies (thankfully); even when there is, it is rarely overdone and tends to be overshadowed by the witty comedic remarks that accompany it.The cast is mostly good. Having known the actors from their more recent films, I knew a bit what to expect. Michael Cera (whose acting capacity seems reduced to awkward teenagers, and not fun ones at that) wasn't good, but actually very irritating. Jonah Hill was surprisingly funny as a stereotypical tough-wannabee nerdy guy, and actually compensates for Cera (strange how Cera got all the buzz for 'Superbad', though considering how pretentious Hill ended up now him receiving it could have been worse). He also makes for some rather funny visual gags.Christopher Mintz-Plasse is the one true stand-out from the cast (making it more surprising how he is the one with the weakest post-'Superbad' career), and the whole police spoof (cops played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader) was hilarious (even the visual gags where good); the best part of the film to me. Emma Stone is excellent too, one of the few who managed make it big while keeping her talent, while the other girls (Martha MacIsaac and Aviva) make the little screen time they have be very worthy.Easily one of the best teen comedies I've ever seen, it is good to see some of these actors before they made it big. The easy, laid-back and unforced dialogue by a mostly very funny cast is what makes this stand out.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Still an obvious genre comedy but rises above this to a point thanks to some imaginative ""geeky"" touches","It is not long before friends Seth and Evan will be going their separate ways at different colleges but yet the changes for parties and/or any sexual experiences seem just as remote as ever. However when Seth gets invited over to a party with a girl in his home economics class he makes rash promises in regards buying alcohol for the whole party. To Seth, Evan and friend Fogell the biggest challenge initially appears to be buying alcohol with a rather unconvincing fake ID card but this soon becomes even more difficult than they imagined due to a robbery, a car accident, inept cops and several other obstacles.Superbad came out shortly after Knocked Up and the hype surrounding that sort of continued to wash over this film. At the time I didn't bother with it because I wasn't sold on the trailers but after thinking that Knocked Up was quite good I decided to check it out. What I found was a film that doesn't want to be a simple genre movie but mostly is just that. The plot betrays this more than anything else since it is a bit of a geek fantasy with plenty of action and parties. So far so genre and indeed those that actively dislike the genre will not be won over by this, however that doesn't mean that it is just a basic genre film.What makes it a bit better than it could have been is that the comedy does have some nice imaginative touches thanks to the writing of Rogen and Goldberg. This is not to say that it is brilliant but just that it is informed by a modern feel that connects with those in the generation who do talk in pop-culture references and such. This aspect of it does raise it above the rather obvious narrative and I did find myself chuckling along to it regardless. The cast help it a great deal. Cera dominates by bringing his ""Arrested Development"" awkwardness to the role. Hill a bit more obvious as he fills a more traditional genre role but does so with good ""fat kid"" humour. Mintz-Plasse is very much a simple physical gag but he is an enjoyable one and works well with Rogen and Hader despite their thread being one of the dumbest parts of the film.Overall then a reasonably enjoyable genre comedy that benefits from the writing of current ""men of the moment"" Rogen and Goldberg as well as Cera being in the cast. Not good enough to get those who don't like the genre to enjoy it and not the brilliant comedy it was hailed as but it is still a pretty good entry in a mostly so-so genre.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"It's actually good, and I did not expected that","Review on the humour:I watched this movie, because I saw someone analyze and breaking down a scene, so It made me curious, but still didnt really give It a try because of the actors that appear on the front of the movie, they usually make humor...well not of my style.This movie surprised me, because even tho there was ""that"" type of humor present, It was a lot clever that I expected, and made giggle a couple of times, which again, I was not expecting.I also really enjoy Bill Hader's character (Slater), It was pretty good, along with Christopher Mintz(Mclovin).
And the photography and screenplay of the film, make It enjoyable to watch.

"It is not Super, nor is it Bad, but like High School it seems like it never ends.","The return of the R-rated comedies is reaching full force, as we now have a new group of actors that's giving the Frat Pack some competition. Starting with the short-lived television shows ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""Undeclared;"" Judd Apatow, Seth Rogan, and a slew of other buddies have emerged from the shade and into the spotlight with consecutive hits. Already with one summer success under their belt (Knocked Up), the crew has decided to take on the R-rated High School genre. This genre doesn't see much success, with movies like American Pie becoming an exception to the rule. Nonetheless, with its inability to hold back punches and amazing amount of energy and chemistry amongst the actors and actresses, Superbad looks like a hit from a mile away. While this movie does indeed deliver more laughs than the American Pie films, it's still far from perfect. The movie drags, there isn't much content underneath the vulgarity and jaw-dropping moments, and it lacks the emotion and chemistry from previous hits ""Knocked Up"" and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" But if you are looking for a raunchy good time, then look no further, because Superbad is quite a naughty little flick.Superbad follows two high school friends that are about to separate once the semester is over. Seth (Jonah Hill) is a vulgar, unsympathetic, foul-mouthed, and sex-starved class clown; while his best friend Evan (Michael Cera) is a shy nice guy who has strong feelings for the pretty Becca (Martha MacIsaac). Together, they will try to score with their current crushes by joining a party and promising alcohol---with the help of the nerdy and antisocial Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Along the way they will not only run into a bunch of quirky and sometimes dangerous scenarios, but it will also unleash the vent-up anger that all three have towards each other. Written by Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg, these two know how to incorporate high school anxieties and fears and embarrassments without the movie feeling clichéd. What makes Superbad so fresh and unique is that it does not fear offending nor does it fear potentially grossing the audience out. In here we get some really raw dialogue, graphic imagery, and plenty of gross-out humor. Taking place over the course of one evening, Superbad follows in the footsteps of previous high school classics like American Graffiti.Superbad is funny, no question, there are plenty of wonderful one-liners and funny moments (especially in the first act). Yet going past the humor, it lacks the heart that classic high school movies contain. Also it doesn't help that our main character is a bit of a jerk. Why Seth and Evan are together is a bit questionable considering that Seth usually has nothing good to say, and Evan has nothing but a pure good heart and admirable qualities. The black sheep of the trip is Fogell, whose appearance with the other two is also questionable considering the lack of decent treatment he gets. The audience winds up rooting for Fogell in the end of the movie, not really Seth (Or it could be because he's actually McLovin, like the previews showed). What keeps Superbad afloat is actually the well-written story, as the impossibility of accomplishing their mission becomes more and more present as the third act approaches. This movie steers in many unique directions, and becomes quite unpredictable.Greg Mottola, not Judd Apatow like the commercials make it seem, is running the show. In the director chair, he limits the improvising and focuses more on the story. That's what makes Superbad less of a quotable movie than previous adult comedies, yet maintains stability---until the end. The third act practically runs out of steam, as it looks like they didn't quite know how to end the movie. Instead, we are received with an ending that leaves out characters for the last several minutes, and doesn't quite feel complete. You need a feel-good ending in these types of films, and it just wasn't delivered here.Bottom Line: Superbad isn't an instant classic, nor is it a disappointing disaster. Instead, it's a decent flick with its issues and problems. The ending wasn't great, the main characters doesn't incite sympathy or support from the viewers, the running time felt a bit long, and it doesn't help that it has to follow-up to gems like recent adult comedies 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Wedding Crashers, and Harold and Kumar. The writing, directing, and editing were fine up until the very end, when they didn't quite know how to finish the picture. The acting was good, but the characters they were portraying just weren't that interesting(with the exception of McLovin). The genre has very few true classics and complete films, so despite the setbacks this still stands as one of the better high school comedies in recent years. Going with friends would definitely enhance the experience, as you all can relive the good ol' days of high school and the embarrassing moments that follow.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Not super, not bad, not you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll hurl status.","I hate to rain on the parade of the 'funniest movie ever' but Superbad wasn't bad, but is not a laugh riot. Some teen age insights amid the top the next one gross sexual joke, but a ridiculous cop buddy Supertroopers laid on American Pie-dom does not a classic make. As a guy I laughed a lot, not the kind of lost it at the movies laughs of a Dumb and Dumber or the building snort by snort belly laughs of The Big Lebowski, and not the continuous tumescence of Animal House. I also wondered what any girl might think of the whole premise of the plot or the grossness of the jokes? There weren't any girls in the audience I sat with, mostly guys in their twenties, some high schoolers, and amid the group there wasn't the universal hysteria the reviews posted seem to suggest. The major paid movie reviewers waxed rhapsodically about this movie but having spent many an afternoon sitting with movie reviewers in various screening rooms, they are blood brothers (and seem the types to giggle over menstrual blood) to Seth, Evan, and Fogel. Seth is given to many adult like rages, Fogel too many moments of unbelievable nerdiness, the cops too many similar scenes of 'just wanting to have fun, for this movie to move the average movie goer or to cause one to get beyond a laugh to a laugh riot. Evan, on the other hand, is allowed to make his character in the movie a real person. More universal, less nerdy or fake aggressive. There was something in his voice, something that we all were in high school that is the best thing in the movie.It must not have been chance but clear thinking that did not include any of the ridiculous cop buddy sub plot in the previews.

Crude but hilarious,"Another year, another gross-out teen comedy about horny high-school losers attempting to vanquish their virginity. Two co-eds who are attempting to woo a group of girls by supplying their party with booze end up having the most elaborately awry night of their life. Going into the screening one could be forgiven for fearing the worst with the sheer number of schlock that had been farmed out of Hollywood since American Pie made the teen comedy cool again. Fear not, Superbad is a riot, and so for two key reasons. One - it is produced by Judd Apatow, comedy auteur of such hits as Knocked Up and The 40 Year Old Virgin. Two - its two stars, Jonah Hill and Michael Cena are fantastic finds. Hill takes an obnoxious, porn-obsessed oaf of a kid and laces him with bags of charm and great comic timing.

One was loud and obnoxious and pretty vile, the other was a charisma vacuum and dull to the point of being in a coma. really how can you people watch this rubbish and like it?",,Anonymous,Comedy
Raunch with a little intelligence,"Superbad is like reading Playboy for the articles as well as the retouched pictures. If you like a little intelligence with your raunchy dick jokes and crotch rubbing, if you go along gleefully with completely implausible situations and hit-or-miss American Pie-ish humor, Superbad is the movie for you. The dick that had me laughing the hardest was juxtaposed with Tiananmen Square on screen, if you can believe that.Evan (Micheal Cera) is the voice of reason that keeps the core of the film real, and he has enough chemistry with his blustery buddy Seth (Jonah Hill) to make the resolution satisfying and believable.The girls all have personalities, which is a plus for a film like this.The weakest parts of the film are those that include the writer, Seth Rogan, who along with Bill Hader play cops who are less competent and more broadly ridiculous than their Keystone Kop ancestors. But Fogell, a.k.a. McLovin, (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who transitions from timid and panicked in their company, keeps some of these scenes from hurting the film.All in all, a fun time, if not a top-notch movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Superbad is not too Super,"The overrated, over-directed, and overacted Superbad brings forth some shits and giggles but in no way compares to its predecessor The 40 Year Old Virgin. While the same humor is used, it lacks character emotion for the viewer to care, gross moments that are meant to be funny but dragged out four minutes too long, and an over abundance of bitching and moaning.The film tells the story of Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan, (Michael Cera) two best friends who are in their senior year of high school who have their plans for being roommates in college ruined when Evan gets into Dartmouth and Seth does not. When both their high school crushes invite them to a party and ask them to get alcohol their quest begins. With freak occurrences and their dependence on Evan's annoying Dartmouth bound friend, Fogell they engage in one of the wildest nights of their lives.The grotesque humor as funny as it is, is used so much that the film overdoses like a drug user and loses its target audience. As it will relate to the young adult audience, it has potential to become a film icon like Old School and Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. As you watch it more, the film may become funnier with each viewing. But I'm afraid the script is a little everywhere and the characters are ultra annoying to watch. Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg had the right idea but try too hard like their boss, Judd Apatow who knows how to bring comedy and development together perfectly. The duo fail on almost every level.Grade: **/****",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Super cool,Super hilarious,Super awesome,SuperBad indeed.!!!!","By far the most unexpected movie for me in such a long time. I'm glad I saw this by far the funniest all year. The characters work, they seem real enough, raw, charismatic for both the two lead cast. They did great playing their roles specially through those laugh out loud situations. The plot? damn the plot when there's mclovin and two Mofo's trying to get booze and getting laid by the last girls that would with them.This is one of the best movie's this year a very different outlook on comedy, accurately done to project the stupidic purpose. But hey its all about the laughter and you cant miss this one. Extremely recommended. Even the portrayal of two bestfriends loving each other is awkward as it is hilarious to watch. 10/10 jonah did pull through here.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Coming of age movie that stands on it's own.,"First of all, any review that uses 'Superbad' in its title in an attempt to put the movie down reveals more about the depth of the review rather than the movie itself.While there is nothing new about a movie that features a bunch of teenage boys obsessing over the opposite sex and ways to get laid, it is unfair to compare Superbad to American Pie, Porky's and the like.The key factor that drives this movie beautifully are the characters. If we didn't know someone like Seth, Even and Fogell at school then that's probably because we were like one of them. Each of the actors superbly portrays the bravado boys use to mask their insecurities over dealing with girls.The humour is plentiful, funny and appropriate and yes, there's plenty of bad language and crudity, but we're talking about a teen movie here, not an Alfred Hitchcock classic. Anyone watching a teen movie who then gets offended by swearing and sex should not be watching that movie in the first place.This movie reminds me of my own days at school decades ago now when us guys simply could not stop using the 'F' word and looking back we must have sounded ridiculous. I can also remember my first day lying about my age not in order to buy alcohol but adult magazines off the top shelf as well as the first alcohol fuelled party that I attended. Superbad brings these memories back vividly.Even though I'm a big fan of Ferris Bueller's Day Off, I have to admit that Bueller's character was not only unrealistic and outlandish, but bordering on dislikeable. Watching it recently I found myself rooting for Principal Ed Rooney to give Bueller his comeuppance.Geekily charming, yet annoying and endearing at the same time Fogell 'McLovin' now has to be one of my all time favourite teen characters. The characters of Officer Slater and Officer Michaels only work well because they bounce off the character of McLovin. Seth and Even work well as a teen odd couple and all three lead characters are developed well to the extent that you even end up rooting for all of them.So, all in all a very funny movie, with some very touching moments. If you want to watch a movie that takes you back to your school days, your old friendships and your attempts at trying to pass for 21, this is it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Decent but not great,"Definitely not as funny as hyped. There were a handful of hilarious scenes, but overall pretty much the same adolescent humor one finds in all of Apatow's movies (and I am a fan of his movies). Not much new ground here.McLovin was great and some of the other characters were really funny, but many of the scenes, especially the ones with the cops, were just boring filler. Also the writers seemed to be trying for a world record in profanity with every other word being the f-word or something similar. When writers use profanity in every line it shows they're just being lazy. Especially in this context, it works in a gangster movie, but not in a dumb teen comedy.Lastly Apatow could use a better editor. All of his movies drag on for too long. This one was no exception. Overall a decent flick, but not great.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Probably the most overrated film ever,"Because this movie has such a large and strong following, I'm going to start out by saying that I laugh during Jackass. I loved Scary Movie 1-3. I even LOVE tourettes guy. But tourettes guy was funny, this was not. To be fair, I entered the theatre with mixed, but decently high expectations. I was cautious because I had heard about it for years and years before it came out, which is never a good sign. Upon seeing the movie these are things I realized: -Honestly, I found some parts were funny. This isn't a total this movie is feces kind of comment. The cops were the funniest, and there were some moments here and there -Michael Cera was just about perfect. He's a very talented performer.-Here's the downer part. I had to wait for so long for this film to be funny. The first ten minutes was them talking about porn and stuff and them drinking, it just wasn't entertaining at all to me, but maybe I was viewing it with too high of a reading level. And I shouldn't say just the first ten minutes, because 98% of the movie is stuff that would be funny to high people because they say anatomical parts, but no normal person would find funny because it's irrelevant or not even a joke.-This movie relied so much on the words vagina and booze that it instantly made it the favorite movie of most of my high school. For those of you reading this, that's a note that you will probably like it. As for me, I usually find vagina jokes funny but there were no vagina jokes. They merely talked about vaginas and it was pointless. The screenwriter (s) for this movie got the easiest job ever.-Really, that sums it up I think. A few funny parts, but is horrible unless you find kids drinking and talking about random crap funny.",,Anonymous,Comedy
ha just ha!!,"I have to admit that I didn't really want to watch this film back in 2007/2008. I remember my brother saying I should watch it and the title of the film didn't really intrigue me but i thought i would give it a go, and glad I did. The film plot is very simple, and some could sat stupid or silly, but i feel this film is good because the plot is simple. I personally have to be in the right mood to watch a film that requires a good amount of concentration and lots of questioning. A simple story is often good. The films jokes are kind of like"" Teen humor"", but it it done in a way that is funny to all.

Better Than Expected,"Before I begin my review, I'd like to say that I HATE teen movies. Almost all of them have little plot and lots of sex, sex, sex. It gets old. That's why I was very hard pressed to see this movie, despite all of my fiancés goading. I braced for the worst.As it turns out, it was actually hilarious. Yes, it was full of sex. Getting laid was the entire plot. There were many great one liners and subtle humor involved though. There were some scenes that had me laughing well after the movie was over.This movie isn't for everyone though. I hardly think older generations would enjoy it. Anyone who is uncomfortable with sex, cussing, and perverted jokes wouldn't like it either. On the other hand, young adults would like it. This is definitely full of ""4chan humor"", so you know anyone from there would love this movie.The great acting, funny scenes and characters, and relatable high school humor will make up for all of the crudeness involved.

Surprisingly mediocre,"You know, I enjoyed the 40-Year-Old Virgin and to a lesser extent, Knocked Up, but Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen seem to be running dangerously short on material at this point. Superbad isn't a terrible movie, but it's essentially a more profane American Pie with less nudity. Rogen appears as the same character in the other two movies, but with a different occupation, this time a cop. Michael Cera (George Michael from Arrested Development) is the standout in the movie, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse is appealing as a character somewhat similar to the MILF guy from American Pie. Jonah Hill, an Apatow regular, does his best to try and one-up Seann William Scott in the annoying category. The amount of profanity in this movie doesn't bother me, though it is probably excessive for the average movie fan, but the plot offers absolutely nothing new, and if you've seen the previews, you've seen (edited versions of) all the jokes. I was hoping this would be an improvement over the quality of comedies that have been successes lately (i.e. I Know Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, Wedding Crashers), and it probably is, but only slightly.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Best Teen Comedy Ever,"Superbad is one of those movies where you laugh out loud the whole way through. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill's relationship is hilarious and more importantly so real. Their chemistry drives the film but the supporting actors are equally as brilliant. As someone who just recently graduated high school, I can relate perfectly to the characters and their emotions as well the realness of the dialogue and partying. This movie is better than American Pie, more real than Dazed and Confused, and I can even say funnier than Fast Times. That's saying a lot. I just really can't express how funny this film is. Go see it right now if you haven't. I give it 9.5/10 only because it has about a 10 minute slow period, but the other 105 minutes are the most brilliant 105 minutes I've ever seen in comedy.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Has its Heart in the Right Place,"For every really funny and relatable moment, there's also a ton of material that ages horribly. It gets most of its laughs within the first and third acts, but the second nearly runs out of steam with how dragged on many of the stakes and consequences are. That said, Jonah Hill & Michael Cera make a hysterical married couple in the form of two best friends since childhood, and the chemistry between Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Seth Rogen and Bill Hader arguably caters the funniest interactions and dumb stunts in the whole feature.While this era of raunchy teen humor is thankfully no longer around, knowing that Rogen and co-writer Evan Goldberg based the film off of their last years in high school gives this film a charming enough identity on its own. Plus, seeing Emma Stone in this nowadays is truly refreshing knowing the myriad of accomplishments in her career since then.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Irreverent, Snappy and Unpredictable, Superbad is One of the Decade's Best Comedies","Michael Cera and Jonah Hill are precisely in their element as a pair of hyper-awkward high school seniors, attempting to delicately navigate their way around virginity before college. Snide, sharp and effortlessly witty, it's an absolute howl, even for folks who may not have worked through the same problems at that age. Hill and Cera have great chemistry, bouncing insults and muttering puns at a machine-gun pace, and they get a ton of help from the supporting cast. Seth Rogen and Bill Hader damn near steal the show as a pair of irresponsible cops out for a joyride with Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who is himself unforgettable as the eccentric uber-geek ""McLovin."" I just wish it could've hovered in its zone of meaningless shenanigans the whole way through, because the last twenty minutes - when the plot suddenly realizes it needs to get going - are something of a chore to push through. Still, it's great enough that I'd call it a generation-defining comedy, tremendously written and utterly unstoppable when it's in a groove.

Glorious Taboo strippage 'lets get felashed',"Seth Rogan, talent is all i can say. A cast of talented unknowns, a dynamite script. A damn good time, there are some films that give off no indication as to why they are so loved, like the Rocky Horror Picture Show as an example. Superbad's main card is that it is, strikingly honest in it's comedic situations, it's a film that anyone who was ever a young male, can relate too. Though females may find little humor in this film, men will be in stitches. I can see countless offended viewers that may walk out of this film offended, shocked. It is all an act, it's just too true for them to handle. That policeman may not be entirely perfect, that boys do have penis' and girls do have vagina's. That sex is good, that the moments that the world tells us to forget are the best times of our lives.

Authentic and hilarious,"I don't think anyone is going to claim that ""Superbad"" is a film of extraordinary thematic depth or anything (although the script has more depth than most high school-based comedies, certainly), . What I will go ahead and say is that ""Superbad"" DOES have a great comedy script. It is not only funny quite frequently, it is also astonishingly accurate regarding high school life. Sure, the scenes with McLovin' and the cops are slightly indulgent and lack believability, but the rest of it is thoroughly believable, realistic, and authentic. It's also perfectly directed, with great use of music and terrific comic timing with the editing and direction, as well as excellent performances from the entire cast.It is the sense of authenticity that makes ""Superbad"" different than and superior to most teen comedies. Evan and Becca's relationship is far more authentic than it would be in a more clichéd teen comedy script and is encapsulated perfectly in their first conversation in the film, where Evan is a bumbling idiot and Becca has a natural reaction of bewildered amusement to him as opposed to what you would have usually gotten in this sort of movie: she stares at him awkwardly and blows him off. Moreover, the actual conversations aren't based on what the writer THINKS teens sound like, it IS what teens sound like.Admittedly there are several jokes that fall flat but for the most part this is a hilarious and honest script. Sometimes too honest, I don't recall anyone in the theater laughing much at the scene where Becca and Evan almost have sex, not because it isn't funny on a basic level but because it is such a brutally honest filming of the sort of event casual sex is at this age. You rarely see scenes like that in Hollywood movies, where everything is idealized. One doesn't need to look beyond the ""American Pie"" movies to see how that scene would have played out in most teen movies.""Superbad"" is an excellent movie. It will be remembered and it will be popular a long time from now, I expect as popular as something like ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" is now, if not more popular. With all the limitations of making an out and out comedy about teen life (which is often too melancholy to examine properly without veering off too much into drama), ""Superbad"" manages a surprising juggling act and if as I suspect the fact that the names of the writers match the names of the lead characters is no coincidence, that is perhaps not so surprising.8.5/10",,Anonymous,Comedy

Funny flick but...,"I saw this one on on-demand after a friend's recommendation. I wouldn't say I loved it but I wouldn't say it disappointed entirely either.

The thing about him is that he's almost accidentally funny. The situations he manages to get himself into are absolutely hilarious.It pains me to say this about a movie like this but the two main characters are just not that likable.

Very crude and hilarious,"Superbad is a movie about awkward teens coping with high school and their lack of popularity (like so many others). The big difference here is that this film is so over the top insane and crude that it's much worse than most high school movies. By way of comparison, it makes American Pie look like a family film.The plot is simple, a couple of best friends in high school (with a third in tow), all very low on the popularity totem pole, plan on using a fake ID to buy booze for a party being held by one of the most popular girls in school. They think that if they can come through with the alcohol, the two girls the most desire will make them men just before their final year ends. Along the way, they run into muggers, cops, psychotic college partiers and a host of other oddball characters.Seth Rogen's writing (and Judd Apatow's contribution) here is evident, simply because this movie is so crude and rude and fully deserves it's 18A/R rating. Nonetheless, it is very funny. Seth Rogen also does an excellent job as a rookie policeman who inadvertently helps the guys buy the alcohol.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Surprisingly, the title doesn't reflect the film's quality","There are many films which need to be seen in a certain context, with certain expectations, and with the realization that certain qualities which would normally add quality to a film will most likely be absent, without making the film any less enjoyable. Superbad is a prime example of all of these afformentioned traits - astonishingly foul mouthed, remarkably stupid yet surprisingly likable and endearing for all of its seemingly negative foibles. What might have been reduced to a generic and exploitive teen sex comedy ended up as... well, not too far from it, but one with surprising heart and enough caustic one liners to take its simple premise, and end up with an unreasonably solid film.It's hard to describe what makes Superbad so enjoyable, considering it appears and feels like yet another trite teen comedy one can only shamefully admit to having viewed, but for whatever reason, the delicate balance between raucous and sentimental clicks, making up for any lapses in logic the plot may demonstrate. The story is perhaps the most familiar in all semi-romanticized teen pop culture: a duo of socially inept friends attempt to procure alcohol for a wild party in order to win one night stands from the objects of their affections, and in the process, an unspoken separation anxiety for the following year at separate colleges comes out. But despite the rank familiarity of the tale, somehow screenwriters Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg manage to present a surprisingly touching as well as vile and hilarious (if not always realistic) portrait of the decline of teenage years and the nostalgic bittersweet twinge left behind. While it is true that the film may have little to say on the subject of high school that hasn't already been explored by countless films before, the voice in which the tale is related is a genuine one (one is left to wonder how much of the story is based on the screenwriters' actual lives...) and one which near anyone can relate to in some degree, or at least share a bawdy laugh with.Another boost to the film's quality was the casting of mostly relative unknowns, who may be familiar faces from other similar comedies, but not well known enough to achieve 'name' status - much like the high school personas they inhabit here. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera's oddball chemistry makes for a surprisingly likable and highly relatable lead duo - these are guys everyone has gone to school with, sat in class with, bumped into in the halls and seen skulking off in the corner at a party. Providing great comedic support to an already highly comedic pair is newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who takes the oh so stereotypical nerdy sidekick role and somehow manages to squeeze fresh comedic potential out of it. Seth Rogen and Bill Hader, playing a pair of somewhat out of place party animal cops also manage to raise laughs unreasonably beyond the potential of their premise. Unfortunately, the performance lows are the already minimal female parts, who, unlike the believably crafted male characters, generally come across as contrived and often simply reduced to simply eye candy, though Martha MacIsaac and Emma Stone as the lust objects of the lead duo manage to give charismatic enough performances despite their disappointingly poorly written roles. It would seem keeping with the autobiographical note of the film that like their male protagonists, the screenwriters still aren't familiar enough with women to write plausible parts for them.Yes the film is fraught with repetitive, stupid comedy and profane one-liners whizzing by, and yes it does reduce the essence of high school to drinking, sex, and drinking for the purpose of procuring sex, but the emotional heart and soul of the picture resonate strongly enough to make the film surprisingly endearing, providing an oddly charming inner core to the profane exterior. Superbad could be described as a sort of feel good film for recent high school graduates, or those reflecting back with a nostalgic tear on the crazy carefree days of their youth, or it could be described as a raucous, profane and gut bustingly hilarious take on the teenage dream, or at least a romanticized version of it - the reality being, the film somehow manages to seamlessly blend the two, distributing heartfelt sentiment with a cheery smile and an unapologetic innuendo, making the end result far more enjoyable than it had any right to be.-7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Superfunny! My all time favourite film,"Where to start?I must've watched this film over 100 times and still find it funny every time, not only from the most memorable quotes such as 'I am Mclovin' but from some of the most random lines from an array of all the characters such as the Homeless guy calling Fogell 'McMuffin'.The casting is perfect as if every character was meant for their role in this film.Michael Cera is incredible, his role as the awkward, shy smart guy fits him perfectly and I think he developed this character from playing George Michael in arrested development.Jonah Hill really impressed me in this and I feel this elevated his career after only being in a couple of comedies before this. His character has some of the best lines in the movie.Christopher Mintz-Plasse playing Mclovin as his first major film is very impressive, he stole the show. Constantly funny, and his relationship with the Cops is incredible writing.Emma Stone was amazing as always, you can tell she was destined to be an incredible actress!Seth Rogen - so funny, another classic display from him, showing what he's capable of, works alongside Bill Hader perfectly.Bill Hader - Loved every second he was on screen, one of my favourite lines from the film comes from him 'Pretend he's your little sister, your little sister, with the picha baga daga dicta!'For a film that supposedly had a budget of $20 million it's very impressive of what was produced, a timeless classic, a film that will never not be funny and that is down to the writing, the casting, even the soundtrack is perfect.If you haven't watched this film, please do. It's nothing special with twists and turns or crazy character portrayal, no stupid cgi or anything like that.

Fine it's a good movie for the genre but in the top 250?,Suderbad is a very funny and entertaining movie. That said it does not deserve nearly the accolades it has received. The only reason that it gets the treatment it does is because it's a big fish in a really small pond. The teenage sex comedy has been in severe decline since Risky Business. The American Pie series is targeted at retards so when a film delivers realistic characters in a sub-genre where writers don't even bother to make the effort people freak out. I'm sure that Seth Rogen would be the first to tell you that Superbad has no business being rated higher than Children of men. Every generation needs a film to define it's youth and I guess this one is it. Too bad that it was written ten years ago.,7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

What sets this story apart from other party films is that the film has a preparation for the party and then what happens after the party and so you get to know what the characters are like whether sober or drunk. With fantastic lines and fun characters it makes the story even better and one you can see over and over.I liked the cast who do a great job with the comedy and even with there movements can make you chuckle. Jonah Hill is the comedy king of this movie and serves up nearly every joke in this with fine brilliance and calm sophistication. Michael Cera is the more rational mind but he does it well and although not so funny still manages to set the other funny characters off. The entire supporting cast around that such as Bill Hader and Seth Rogen among others do a great job and just add to the laughs of this very funny movie.The script obviously is the funny bone and without a decent script it would be a terrible film, and so all acclaim must go to Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg who one are the basis of this film, but also the great writers of this who mix comedy and friendship well together so that it isn't sweet but not too sour either. The direction also needs praise as much of that is what makes it funny with fast scenes that you just think ""WOAHHH"", perfection in this genre of comedy.Any bad things come, well I am not sure, some jokes do miss the mark but never that badly. I feel some people also will hate the crude humour and so that is basis for some criticism to say it relies on that type of humour, but what do you expect from a teen comedy like this. Yet again it is your perspective when it comes to criticism and what YOU like and don't like in comedy, some will like some won't, but I do think the majority will enjoy this.I would recommend it to basically to who I said would enjoy it, those who like teen comedies should be pleased by this and American Pie fans should equally be pleased by it. Don't watch if you don't appreciate drunken behaviour and sexual tones too because this is chock full of it, maybe only certain people will like it and possibly being a teen comedy, it is aimed at making teens and young adults laugh.Strongly a Very Good film and I felt it was super close to being a straight great but wasn't quite a there at great and excellent film but all the same very good is no underrating nor overrating. Watch it with friends and drink and eat with it and go with the flow, the party can entertain large groups of people at a time and laughs with come from all corners of the room.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Hilarious, but a little Cliché and Lazy","I'm sorry to report that Superbad is a clear step backward in terms of character and story from Apatow's previous stuff, although, admittedly, it was only produced by him, not directed. Superbad is one big long hilarious sex joke from beginning to end, but once all the thin layers are stripped away, there's not much left to distinguish it from other films of its ilk.Jonah Hill is Seth and Michael Cena is Evan, two high school seniors who are on their last week of school and want to go out with a bang. So they enlist the aid of a friend who would make the nerdiest of nerds look like Brad Pitt - Fogell, played squeakily excellently by newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse.He has just purchased a fake ID, and the plan of the three is to use it to buy alcohol for a party so they can get girls drunk and sleep with them. Fogell goes to the liquor store and is knocked out by a thief (whom we never see again), causing the clerk to call the police in to look for the robber. Can you say, ""contrived plot point?""Aside from the three main characters, everyone else is a tired stereotype, from the stupid cops of Seth Rogen and Bill Hader (played with enough pizazz to overshadow their cliché-ness), to the naïve liquor store counter girl who accepts a clearly highly suspicious fake ID, to the girls merely existing so that the main characters can (or cannot) have sex with them. True, most of these are laugh-out-loud hilarious, but for me that didn't overshadow how uncreative they were. In conjunction with this qualm of mine, I also didn't appreciate how everybody except the three main characters seemed to have lost their brains on the way to their parts. Films like ""Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" succeeded because all the characters were three-dimensional real people, not stereotypes. Neither Jonah Hill nor Michael Cena carry enough charisma and clout to make us believe these are actually real people. Jonah Hill plays the exact same part he played in Knocked Up, only without the drugs. On top of all this, the movie is false in its claims to authentically portray the boy high school experience because of how, suspiciously, the entire high school is populated by 25-year old drop dead gorgeous women. Much has also been said about the F-word being dropped at least three times a minute  but so what? What movie doesn't have the F-word these days? This doesn't make it good. It's not like it was some kind of huge risk for them to use it. This isn't the 70's people, it's the 21st century, and when the F-word is used a lot it's not some reason to be impressed by bravura film-making.Finally, my biggest beef with the movie is its faux brotherhood undertones. Yes, Hill and Cena do share wonderful chemistry, but the ""conflict"" between them (each of them are going to separate colleges at the end of the year) is barely mentioned three or four times, and it seems merely added for the purposes of giving the film an Apatowsian flair. It's competently done, of course.It's nowhere near as developed as the emotional heart of Apatow's previous two theatrical outings, where the drama was sewn into the whole in such a way that if you removed it, the entire thing would fall apart. In Superbad, though, it seems more of an extra doohickey than something that was needed.Despite all my criticisms, I'm giving this movie a good recommendation simply because of how hilarious it is. Both Hill and Cena hit each comedic note perfectly, and Hader and Rogen as the cliché cops add just the right amount of ridiculousness to make their inclusion forgivable. The most hilarious aspect of the movie comes in the running joke that Fogell changed his name to McLovin when he bought a fake ID. This joke runs throughout, but through intelligent script-writing it never loses steam and always draws a hearty belly laugh. The McLovin' joke alone is worth the entire price of admission, and in a movie with literally a laugh-a-minute, that's saying something. Some moments in the movie also (probably purposefully) recall classics like American Pie, which really helps the movie's appeal, because it throws into contrast how lacking American Pie's comedy is in relation to Superbad's. The writing is simply much more talented and does a heck of a lot more with the material. I couldn't stop laughing throughout the entire thing, and though at the end of the day it lacked a certain heart and soul that prevents me from giving it an extremely high rating, it does bring the laughs.Perhaps I'm being a little too unfair on Superbad. After all, the director is some guy named Greg Mottola who must be feeling like the luckiest guy in the world right now, with the reigning king of R-rated comedy producing his flick. Why should I place the burden of Apatow's success upon this filmmaker's shoulders? The reason is that Superbad was billed as ""from the guys who brought you Talladega Nights and The 40-Year Old Virgin."" With a title like that, it's obviously wanting very badly to be the next Knocked Up. But if Apatow wasn't attached to the project, you can bet it wouldn't be half as successful, and probably even lower in the critical ratings, too. It was a clever advertising campaign, to be sure, but it only causes me to be suspicious if Superbad actually has any inherent value. For now, I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt  it's not as good as the other two hilarious comedies of the summer, Knocked Up and The Simpsons Movie, but it is a great fun-filled teen sex comedy romp that is still above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
'R' rated 'Can't Hardly Wait'...worth it.,"Basically it is like I said. An R rated version of Can't Hardly Wait, or a funny version of American Pie (Thats right peeps, that movie was not funny...give it up.) In Reno Nv here we got an advance screening shy of 3 weeks before the release date so with a crowded movie theatre (all seats filled) and a freakishly strict no cell phone policy (tighter than airport security) we trudged on...I haven't laughed this hard since Borat, J&S Bob strike back, Anchorman or Super Troopers. Talk about a movie where you actually care about the characters, yes, Losers make the best protagonists. Watching the movie and hearing the crowd erupt all I could think was ""Man, this movie is gonna be huge, I hope people don't ruin it and run it into the ground with quotes..."" That would be a shame.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I Guess It Didn't Really Click With Me That Much,"So I've obviously heard a lot about this one and even tried to watch it some years ago but I didn't for some reason. But now that I finally watched it, all I can say is ""that's it?""I've seen this movie being mentioned as one of the funniest comedies ever, even saw someone say it's even funnier than Tropic Thunder which is crazy to me. Because even though I watched Tropic Thunder so many years ago that I don't even remember much from it, I still remember it having funny jokes every other minute. But this movie is more like a teen movie with occasional funny scenes.I guess with all the talks about this movie being a masterpiece and funny af and one best comedies every, I got my hopes up expecting to watch a really funny movie on par with Jump Streets and The Hangovers and the Tropic Thunders of this genre. But it just wasn't nearly as funny as any of those. I even watched the recent Curb Your Enthusiasm episode which was only 39 minutes, but I still laughed more watching that than I did with this movie.This type of R-rated comedy is actually my kind of humor and I find it funnier than PG-13 and family-friendly comedies. But this one just didn't work for me that much.There were definitely some laughs here and there, but I wasn't laughing till my sides hurt or anything. I guess I probably would've found it funnier if I was younger and had watched fewer funnier comedies, but it's not like I've grown out of this kind of humor. I can bet I can still watch Jump Street or even The Hangover and find it as funny as I did years ago. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills and don't understand what others see in this, or maybe most people watched it when it came out and it was kinda novel in this genre, but for me, it's just a better directed and funner Project X.Apart from the comedy aspect of the film, the plot itself is kinda shallow too and there isn't much to it. Like I was surprised when I realized the whole movie was gonna be about the alcohol and the party. They try to add some emotional weight to the stories and characters, but they don't really delve into this that much for me to care about any of it. Like I don't have the emotional connection to these characters for me to care much about the aspect of the plot of them getting distanced from each other after high school. Unlike in Jump Street where it works and has an actual well-written plot and characters, or The Hangover for that matter, this movie just isn't as funny nor does it have an impressive plot for me to say ""Oh, maybe the plot is good so that could make up for the lack of laughs"".I guess this would be a good choice and a really funny movie if you're just starting to watch movies, especially comedies, and you haven't seen many comedy movies yet. And maybe I should've watched it when I was gonna, and I would've found it funnier. But after seeing so many good comedy movies and especially TV shows, this one doesn't really impress me much and is kinda forgettable for me, unlike some others I already mentioned here.But, as much as I talked about the negatives, it's not like this is the worst movie ever. It's actually funny at times and it's not a bad watch. This movie is just the quintessential 2000s comedy and kinda isn't that funny anymore, at least for me it seems. It's just that since this movie, there have been so many funnier comedies that have better stories and plot structure that make this movie feel not as funny anymore. I probably won't be rewatching this movie any time soon, or probably never for that matter. Seeing so many people say it's one of the best comedies of the past 30 years or the funniest movie ever didn't help either.So watch it and form an opinion about it yourself, it would most definitely click with you more than it did with me, but don't go there expecting to laugh every 30 seconds or see something funnier than Tropic Thunder.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"a truly and unabashedly immature teen-sex/party comedy, and it's 100% irresistible to the 15 year old in me","I know these guys, or at least feel like I do. Superbad isn't about simple clichéd figures of teenage angst and pent up sexual frustration, or with goofy nerdy stereotypes (though maybe for the latter there is almost that). Somehow Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who name the two lead characters after themselves, just know what it is about these guys, and that teenagers can be foul-mouthed and witty and naive and awkward and stupid and smart and crazy all in some equal measures with the levels put just right. It's low-brow to the max, but it never looks down on the audience but plays always to it, as if the same people right on the poster (McLovin included) are right in the audience, and are damn proud to see themselves up there. It's pretty damn near close to a teen classic comedy, with as much strengths in the dialog as a Dazed and Confused, and more outrageousness than an American Pie would think to go for. Even the cops in the movie are like the teenagers, only a few years old, and with guns, and lots of beer. It's the most fearlessly vulgar comedy of the year.Seth and Evan (Jonnah Hill and Michael Cera, the former from producer Judd Apatow's Knocked Up and the latter from Arrested Development) are best friends in high school, seniors soon to part way for separate colleges, and it bothers Seth that this is happening. Nevertheless, the partying must go on! But where seems to be the question, as they're both not exactly 'hip' amongst most, and don't get invited. Yet there is a change, as Seth is asked by Jules (Emma Stone) to a party with the condition that he bring the booze. A problem? Not quite- McLovin- a.k.a. Fogel (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, one of the great teen movie nerds) has a phony ID with said name, and goes through his own crazy adventure in first getting the supplies, then punched out by a random looter, then riding along with cops (Seth Rogen and Bill Hader) who wan't just as much a good time as he does; what better way to bust a crime than at a bar- some beers on the way! Then comes the party, but first a detour at another party, then some mishaps with a stain (big whoops), and finally some good times at the main party, though it may depend on your definition of ""good"" in terms of drunken would-be sex and letdowns.It's all very outrageous, every step of the way, and there's not a scene that goes by that doesn't contain the laughs that the actors, writers, and director go for. Even stuff that should be just crude and insane, like the many, many, many drawings of genitalia (and more if you stay through the end credits) from the 4th grader Seth, or the near Raising Arizona-like chase scene with the cops sloppily on route following a sudden hit and run with Seth and Evan, or puke jokes, or the 'stain' joke (where you can hear the collective groan from the audience, a great sign that people in the demographic can still be shocked or disgusted at least), or even the fate of the cops and McLovin as they tear up the cop car. All of it somehow connects completely, because Rogen and Goldberg, as well as the actors, don't pass by the truth that is within much of the scenes. Through all the antics they're just guys who have equal anxieties at their age regarding sex and friendship (not to mention that perfectly gay scene when they're snuggled drunk in the sleeping bags), and there's even a sweetness to their ambitions and disillusionment.Like Knocked Up, it's relatable as long as there's a given amount of suspension of disbelief. But Superbad goes even further than that film- and rightfully so- at combining physical comedy with what must be improvisation, hinging to the Mel Brooks credo to ""rise below vulgarity"", and at the same time not getting scared off to add some fantastic one-liners and pop culture goofs in the mix (that a goof like McLovin stays fresh all the way to the end is a testament to the longevity of a one-note gag played right). Look at it this way, where else will I find a flick with joke about Orson Welles and the Coen brothers in between lots of talk about d***s and p*****s?",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
SUPERBAD not super,"Ah, to be young and free. It was a simpler time when the pursuit of booze and babes was enough to drive a young man right through to adulthood. Alright, so this wasn't my personal youth experience but it is the premise of director Greg Mottola's SUPERBAD, a new breed of teenage sex comedy. Here, partying and getting naked with girls are exposed as a thinly veiled act of desperation to prove how grown up one is. The kids are speeding down a hill, screaming their excitement to the sky, but can see that they are also getting closer and closer to everything they're afraid of, waiting for them at the bottom. Before they know it, high school will be over and Seth and Evan (Jonah Hill and Michael Cera), best friends since they were five, will find themselves going in separate directions to different colleges. While one raucous night finds them trying to score alcohol to impress the girls they each want to get with, it is what they learn about each other, their futures and themselves that will end up defining the night they thought would simply be the night they got some.Whether Seth and Evan are trying on pants and debating what exactly is ""too tight"" or discussing the injustices of men having to hide their erections in shame from the rest of the world while buying drinks at the corner store, they are always hilarious. You could put these two in practically any scenario and the laughs would flow. They are drastically different but compliment each perfectly. Seth is loud and foul. Nearly every thought that comes out of his mouth is about sex and he is completely oblivious to the world around him. Meanwhile, Evan is mild mannered and meekly composed. He is constantly muttering sarcastic quips that most don't hear and is acutely aware of his surroundings. The two are inseparable but one gets the impression their friendship is based more on its history than what they have in common. One thing they do have in common though is awkwardness. While one covers up his insecurity with obnoxious remarks and the other barely hides it at all, they both have each other to be themselves with. The beauty of their performances lies in the conveyance of the recently rising knowledge that the friendship that makes them feel safe is also now the friendship that is stopping them from going any further.Written by KNOCKED UP star, Seth Rogen and long time friend, Evan Goldberg, SUPERBAD is at times genius in its subtlety. This is no easy feat considering how outrageous it is most of the time. Loosely basing Seth and Evan on themselves (sorry fellas but the names give it away), they manage to pinpoint the moment these boys become aware of their co- dependence. The two characters are so well drawn that you never want them to leave the screen. Only they do to make room for a third friend, Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Fogell is somehow even more socially retarded than Seth and Evan and is himself a funny enough secondary character despite his entire existence being based on one-off joke that is given away in the preview (McLovin!). It is the direction his character takes the film in that is an unnecessary distraction. Fogell/McLovin spends his night riding around in the back of a police cruiser with two of the worst police officers ever to walk the beat (played by Rogen and Bill Hader, whom I would sooner never see on film again). The cops are such screw-ups that all they do is make every scenario they're in worse than it was before they got there. With most of their humour falling flat and not coming close to measuring up to Seth and Evan, they have a similar effect on the film itself. Filler is rarely fun and here it exposes the writers' insecurity regarding their own abilities.So this is the story of how Seth Rogen is both his best friend and worst enemy at the same time. Alongside Goldberg, the two have stated publicly how they never want to grow up. While that gives them a particular insight into the pivotal crossroads Seth and Evan, the characters, find themselves at, it also makes SUPERBAD, a movie about maturity which is meant to be immature at times, less mature than it actually should be. For the most part, SUPERBAD is surprisingly mature, while still maintaining its youthful glow. Seems to me that Seth and Evan, the writers, could stand to learn a thing a two about evolution from the characters they created in their own image. Growing up isn't all that bad and it can still be freackin' hilarious.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It speaks for itself!!,"I'm not much of a writer, but I know good writing when I see it. This movie was brilliant. The previews didn't do it justice. Hell, the title didn't do it justice. I haven't walked out of a teen comedy and been so satisfied since...never. Was it over the top? Of course. But that's okay because they didn't have a 22 year old playing a high school senior. I'm not one for foul language but these guys made the ""F"" word sound like hilarious, abdominal work out poetry. Even if this is the last thing Seth Rogan ever writes, he will always be remembered. And if you're a Michael Cera fan from the best television show ever made, ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, you WILL love this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Superbad was a roller coaster movie of the good, the bad, and the geeky","I saw Superbad yesterday with my boyfriend, I have to say that I was absolutely not interested in seeing Superbad, it seemed like just a typical Revenge of the Nerds type of film that would probably have some lame jokes. But I wanted to see it with an open mind, so I thought just to let go and have fun. This also seemed like it would be a cult classic down the line somewhere. Superbad starts off as it would seem to be another American Pie type of film where it's nothing but sex jokes that could at times be a little obnoxious, I was giving up hope, but then Superbad quickly picked up and turned out to be overall a great movie that is sure to be another teen sex comedy classic.Seth and Evan are two high school boys who are about to go their separate ways after graduation. They are pretty much the losers of the school and are dying to get an awesome reputation as well as a couple of hot girls. Seth gets invited to his crush's party, but when he mentions his friend, Fogell, is getting a fake ID and now he is the one who has to get the liquor. Well, Fogell gets the ID, his name is now McLovin' and is supposedly 27 years old(even though he looks like he couldn't be more than 12 years old), he manages to get away with buying the liquor, but right at the worst moment, the place gets robbed and now he has two cops who just wanna party with him. In the mean time Seth and Evan are on their own and end up at a gangsta's party where they get in big trouble trying to get alcohol, but it's a question if they can make it to the party and still be the awesome guys that made the party a memorable one.Superbad is a great movie and one of the best comedies of the year, no doubt. McLovin' and the cops truly made this movie memorable and had such great chemistry. I really loved their scene where the cops want to ""make it up to McLovin'"" and drag him out of the party like he was a wild animal. You'll see what I mean when you see the film. The film starts off kind of stupid, but really warms up and ended up being a great film to watch. I can't wait for the DVD, I would recommend you seeing this film if you are looking for a great comedy.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious and heartfelt,"As hilarious as I was expecting, but also surprisingly genuine and heartfelt. The relationship between the two leads is absolutely spot on and perfectly blends comedy and drama. This emotional core elevates the film above most other teen comedies and puts it right alongside American Graffiti, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Dazed & Confused. And it's also (probably) the funniest film of the year thus far. Everything from physical slapstick to witty one-liners are utilized and it all works fantastic. The subplot with McLovin and the cops takes away a bit from the central story, but it's so hilarious that it doesn't really matter. The film does run a bit long, and some of the middle should have be trimmed, but, overall, this is still a modern teen comedy classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the funniest films i had seen this past year.,"Superbad (2007, Dir. Greg Mottola)Seth, Evan and Fogell are three teenage guys who love to drink and desperately wish to get laid. When a girl that Seth really likes, asks him to get the drink for her party, he sees this as a perfect opportunity to make her his girlfriend. The trio plan out how to get the alcohol, even including Fogell's new fake ID, but things won't got smoothly for the trio. Seth and Evan become separated from Fogell (now called McLovin) and they still haven't got the alcohol for the party that night.Let me just say one thing first. If you are not a fan of American Pie or any sex teen comedy, then i would strongly suggest you avoid this. The film is the usual story of teenage guys trying to get alcohol and trying to get laid, but it is the fantastic script that has been written and the lovable characters which makes 'Superbad' fantastic. The script is written and performed with a fluid motion. Unlike some films, the two lead characters, Evan and Seth really do feel like they've been friends for years. The three leads act so well. Michael Cera is the lovable nerd and Jonah Hill is one of the best 'speakers' in this film. The words just flow out of him.

Expectations were too high,"The problem is simple. This movie has been being reviewed for a while now and everyone said the same thing, how hilarious it was. The truth is that is a funny movie, no doubt, and a lot of the humor here has not been used before, which made it fresh and original. However, as I felt it started off with a bang, it just slowed as it went along. A lot of the jokes take a huge setup and fall very flat. Its not that there bad ideas, they just don't feel like they were executed that well. I honestly believe that reading all the reviews made me not enjoy this as much and really just hyped it too hard.But by no means is it bad. It was funnier than most movies nowadays and different. My favorite parts about these guys were how real they were. I loved it when they finally get to the party they've been trying to get to all night, and still have enough in them to have a great time. Seth is a jokester and the life of the party and Evan plays the nice guy but not a nerdy guy perfectly. These true to life moments really made this film for me and reminded me so much of my high school life.

Vulgar at some times but it never crosses the line to getting annoying. The actors are great (especially Rogen himself who shines as a member of an extremely idiotic cop team) and make the characters come alive.

Apatow Productions strikes comedic gold yet again,"To classify SUPERBAD as a teen sex comedy is to do a fresh and funny film a great disservice. SUPERBAD, helmed by Greg Mottola of the Apatow gang, while creating a funny and somewhat raunchy (but not over-the-top) comedy with numerous laughs, manages to bring the characters into the focus and keep them there; not an easy task for a movie of this kind.Michael Cera's deadpan and sarcastic approach to his character never seems to get stale, and Jonah Hill provides the ultimate opposite, forming a dynamic and funny duo. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is perhaps the most hilarious of the three, as the now infamous McLovin. Seth Rogen is also quite good as the dysfunctional police officer. My biggest gripe here is that the film is too long for its nature (~110 minutes). A more stern film editor may have opted to omit some more superfluous scenes involving the police officers, while concentrating more on the central duo/trio.SUPERBAD is meant to bring back high-school memories to persons of any age who have had similar experiences, and does so in a relatively tasteful and nostalgic manner, getting most of the key elements right. Not quite comedic genius, but more of a coming-of-age tale. Comedy itself is rather subjective in nature, and a lot will undoubtedly depend on the viewer. Another gem from the Apatow gang. A solid 7/10 and 3 stars (out of 4). Should just about appear in my Top 300 at 277. Recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Totally unexpected,"I totally did not expect to like this movie. I figured it would be full of gross jokes and language that would only appeal to 14-year-olds. I was blown away by how much fun it really was.Michael Cera gets a lot of buzz for his role as Evan, but it was Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse that had me rolling. I especially like the bit where Seth was in the liquor store. That was hilarious.Christopher Mintz-Plasse was also out there as the geek who was outdoing his buddies. With Bill Hader and Seth Rogen as wacky cops, the fun never stopped.But, despite the repetitive joking about getting BJs, it really came down to a movie about friendship and the pain of growing up. It was tender and touching underneath all the juvenile humor.The MILF jokes about Evan's mom (Stacy Edwards) were especially funny.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Super BAD is Super GUD!!,"I wish I had this ****load of fun in my High school. The chemistry between both the guys was good. The script is hilarious n hits bullseye 80% of the times. The movie hardly looses its momentum at any point and it is fun throughout. The fat guy really takes the lead all the times and has done a great job. His body language, dialog delivery everything is just fun to watch. All in all a gr8 movie n the release time is also perfect since most of the kids are going to college at this time n they can easily relate to the desperate n funny measures being taken by the teens to behave like adults. So this movie makes it a total of 3 good movies this summer: Bourne Ultimatum, Live free or Die Hard n Super Good",,Anonymous,Comedy
Superbad is SuperAWESOME,"One of the best comedies that I have seen in quite sometime, well, it hasn't been that long(Knocked Up). When it comes to anything involving Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow, you know that you are going to get an extremely hilarious, yet very relatable comedy. I love this one the most, mainly because, I AM those guys. I just graduated from Highschool, and parties and sex and all that stuff is extremely awkward. And they do that SO well. Michael Cera is the king of Awkward. Jonah Hill is becoming quite a funny guy as well. This movie was so freaking sweet. Go see it the day it comes out, and I promise your stomach will hurt by the time you walk out from laughing so hard, and if you think otherwise, I give you permission to punch me in the gut.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny enough...though over-hyped and unoriginal,"This movie was funny, but definitely overrated. It was basically the same plot as just about every sex-charged buddy movie that's been made in the past fifteen or so years. There was Trojan War, Booty Call, Harold and Kumar, so forth and so on...same plot every time. It's the (end of the week/end of high school/end of college/night before a big high school or collage party) two (dimwitted/stoner/horny/socially inept) friends have a big opportunity to (get laid by the girls of their dreams/get a good meal to satisfy the munchies/get weed). All they have to do is (show up at the party/take a trip to the restaurant/get the weed, booze, or condoms). However, their plan is foiled by a (third wheel friend/forgetting to bring money or something important/teasing women/a desperate criminal/a car breaking down). Undeterred, the two friends vow to complete their mission, all the while dodging (horny women with dangerous boyfriends/a group of bullies/more criminals/wild animals/the police).Yes, there were a lot of funny scenes and lines in this movie. I did laugh out loud many times. However, this was anything but the funniest movie I've ever seen, especially when compared to classics like Caddyshack, Night Shift, Blazing Saddles, Airplane! and the like. For it's genre (low-brow, teen raunch-fest) it was one of the better ones I've seen.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
You got to be kidding me.,"I loved the trailer for this movie, it gave me hope for an American Pie movie, high school kids afraid of growing up looking for their last chance together, and get drunk and laid. Then the reviews (mainly on AICN) came in saying it was one if not the funniest movie of the year.This film was beyond crude, but not crude in a way someone is just crass because he is an individual, but rude in a way that bordered on being hateful. Yes when I was younger we talked about women like with, but the way Seth was doing it whenever he felt the urge just left me totally uncomfortable. He reminded me of the douchebags that were asses to women and everyone else in school.On the way home, my wife and I compared this movie to American Pie, both were about HS kids wanting to party, get drunk, and get laid, maybe it's a generational gap, but Superbad was just horrible pulling it off. I'm super stumped how this movie has been called, ""sweet"" or ""good hearted"" when it was directed at a 15 yr old boy maturity level. Maybe the internet has corrupted kids since 1999, or maybe I'm older, but the 15-18 yr olds in the theater were howling with laughter at the scenes I shook my head on.I've never walked out of a movie, but almost on this one. I should've since I only get Sundays off.I think the young boys growing up don't know squat about satisfying, and woman let guys act like immature little punks.I also didn't think Knocked Up was extremely funny. I enjoyed it, failed to see it as a comedy. Seth Rogan was a lazy douche that no woman with an ounce of self esteem would be around. But she got ""knocked up"" by him, OK, but instead of focusing on that, Rogan wasn't portrayed as a juvenile moron, he was the voice of reason.I guess I'm just too old, but American Pie, and even Can't Hardly Wait, owns this movie.I've said enough, Flame on.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Too big,"Somehow I didn't find this movie to be That Hilarious. I know it's a teen movie, so I'm not expecting that much. I watch this only recently but I remember that this movie gets so much advertisement and I saw them on TVs almost any other day last year. Yet, after I watch it, I find it to be OK. There are a lot more better teen comedy movies out there. Am I entertained? yes to some extend but will I watch it again? NO. I think there's no re-watch value for this movie. The acting is not so bad, the chick factors are OK. Probably for Americans this movie is more closer to their hearts but for me, its just an OK movie. 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
If you get past the first 15 minutes it's not too bad!,"In the first 15 minutes of this movie I wanted to turn it off. It was just a bunch of obligatory swearing and had no value at all. If you can get past the beginning though it turns out to be a decent comedy worth watching.It is the usual teen movie story line. A group of teenage losers hatch a plan to buy alcohol for a party in order to impress girls and lose their virgin status. Now, I saw a problem with the cast already. Michael Cera seems to be only able to play the same boring, nerdy, over thinking, teen character in every single movie he is in, and Jonah Hill is not much better. The usual nasal boredom of their voices usually makes me want to shoot myself for listening the to movie going sheep who love these movies. I watched it anyway and found it to be a pretty funny movie.It turns into a teen misadventure movie that is rather well crafted and a fun ride. Fogel ""McLovin"" (Christopher Mintz-Plasse ) is definitely the best character in the movie, and Bill Hader and Seth Rogan make great appearances as bored cops out or a little fun.It IS a basic teen movie but the misadventures make it worth watching and it actually met the expectations that a lot of people touted. Again, if you are an average person of adult age that doesn't spend every waking moment of your life playing video games and smoking pot, it may be hard to get through the beginning, but from then on out it will still have some good comedic value.Like my reviews?

A new breed of teenage comedy! One of 2007's finest!,"Every now and then Hollywood tends to knock out a comedy about teenagers that causes a stir, ruptures a spleen and sticks with a certain generation, whether it be ""Animal House"","" Porky's"" or ""American Pie"" and 2007's offering is no different. Superbad is quite possibly the funniest film of last year. It continues the tired theme of young men talking about getting ""laid"" and being sex crazed, adolescents pining for alcohol, nerds being singled out by bullies, girls as sex objects and figures of authority being outrageously stupid. Whilst championing the stereotyped desires of your average male pubescent Superbad utilises coarse antics and dirty language to great comedic effect with its well written characters and illogical dialogue. The average film goer will know this type of film inside out and I believe, this time, that to be acceptable as comedies of this nature need to rely on audience preconceptions in order to maintain a good level of comicality. Films like this help to prove that originality isn't necessary and that sometimes reinvigorating well worn ideas with modern themes can be a good thing - and it is not often noted in comedies as being so (more so sub-horror genres).Providing you switch off and ignore the lack of ethnic characters, its sexual stereotyping and its general societal inaccuracies then you will enjoy this film - or you could pretend that you're 15 and phrases like ""sexual stereotyping"" aren't even on your radar yet. Ultimately Superbad isn't new, it isn't a film that pushes boundaries or reinvents the genre  instead it is a film that complements its contemporaries and brilliantly so. It is no surprise that this film did so well with teenage audiences and that so many adults found it repulsive.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Pop Status Achieved,"If teen comedies about guys trying to ""get some"" have to exist, than they should at least be as unabashadly obsessed with their own genitals, as Superbad. I don't know if this will hold up as the ""intant classic"" everyone's dubbing it, but it's funny in it's own right. The friendship is believable and the antics tangible to contemporary audiences in a way that a lot of films, particularly those of the teen comedy have not been. If your someone easily turned off(as I am) by overzealous marketing, than understandably your going to think twice before going anywhere near this film.

Thru Hell and Back,"Superbad is an unbelievable comedy about the lives of three high school seniors right before graduation who are trying to get laid before they go off to college... but wait, I've heard this plot before. But this is a new century for this American Pie, and Superbad fully succeeds in its attempts to create humor and entertainment like the classic would have wanted.The new line of comedy from which Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill and Steve Carell are all a part of has been killing at the box office as of late, and if you haven't hopped on this bandwagon yet, you're long behind. Even though all these movies have the same main cast of characters, each one is different and unique to a specific degree. Superbad has a special entity which derives differently from such titles like Knocked Up or The 40 Year Old Virgin. This movie was much more for teens, whereas Knocked Up was for slightly older partiers and 40 Year Old Virgin was for middle-aged men but could also include all ages due to its humor. Thankfully, these men have worked Superbad in very well to their line of titles.Superbad has whatever the average teen would want to see: brief nudity, sexual situations, comedic punchlines to use on your friends, etc. Everything from A to Z to McLovin has been covered and Superbad leaves little left for you to need.Overall the movie was very entertaining. The plot was constructed well and everything tied in together nicely. The ending was decent but I would have liked more significance in terms of letting us leave it to our imaginations... don't worry, no spoiler. I would give this movie a solid 7 as a comedy. It could be better in a sense that it attracts more of a diverse audience, but as a comedy it does not disappoint. Well done Seth, well done.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It's not only hilarious but it keeps you interested and overall just a fun movie to watch. I can't wait to see it again!This is not a movie for kids though. I'm usually very open minded to the idea of letting kids watch things but not this one. Trust me, from the opening scene all the way through it's very vulgar, shows nudity, and has Several drawings of male genitals.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Seth Rogen Has Successfully Placed His Signature On American Comedy History,"I was always anticipating Superbad, but I never expected anything near to the quality of film-making and cinema experience I received. Coming out of the cinema with a huge grin on my face made me realise that a ""teen flick"" can be a winner, something which seemed impossible. Technically speaking, it is almost impossible to create an even decent ""teen flick"", given that to class Superbad as such a thing would be dismissive. For example, the '90s classic Dazed and Confused is often classed as a teen movie, but it is much more than that, considering the film studies the social-trends of a forgotten era which gave birth to modern teen culture. It is nostalgic viewing for many, just like what Superbad will grow to be in the years to come.Seth Rogen has been having a victorious time throughout 2007; kicking off the summer with Knocked Up and ending with Superbad, he is establishing himself as one of the finest actors and script writers working within modern comedy. Deservedly, this is something the talented comedian has been working for, and now maintains a place within comedic history. Seth Rogen wrote and starred in Superbad, and on viewing the picture you will observe his talent as both a writer and actor.Superbad does not exactly carry a narrative structure, something best suited for a film of its kind and so should not be used as a criticism. Essentially, the film follows the day of three high-school friends who have been invited to a party on account of them providing the alcohol. It is that simple on the surface, but the film turns out to be significantly more intelligent than just teens looking to score and get wasted. Not only does the picture place some moralistic ideas into the dialogue, but it speaks to its audience with an easy-to-relate-to style.If you ever did or are experiencing the high-school lifestyle then Superbad will be an instantly recognisable achievement. The film is crammed with themes which the viewer can relate to and sums up the series of gauche events encountered throughout adolescence. Filmed in garish colours and through exaggerated techniques, Superbad epitomises retro cool and certainly does not value discretion. Everything works perfectly against the outlandishly preoccupied sex jokes. Written with a bravura tone of angst and rebellion, the nerdy comedy fuses with the energetic and welcoming characters. The screenplay is crafted on a torrent of clever hilarities, which progressively become slightly more subtle (if that is even possible for Superbad) as the film develops. Moving at a consistently fast pace, the film refuses to let the viewer have room breathe; it is at these moments that the viewer will most likely realise the timing of the film. And although these moments are a sign of thin wearing, the picture manages to pick its momentum up again, due to the rapid-fire and constant barrage of jokes.The film is going to undoubtedly propel the careers of the three protagonist actors. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera have become relatively well-known over the last couple of years for their work within American comedy. Nonetheless, it is supporting performer Christopher Mintz-Plasse (in his debut role) who outshines the rest of the cast. The casting of him as Fogell a.k.a. McLovin is too good to be true, as he personifies the character entirely and crafts a role which will forever be quoted and loved. Seth Rogen and Bill Hader also star as the two off-beat, lazy cops; the pair work together with an amusing ease, proving that the chemistry depicted is not forced but completely natural. In fact, this goes without saying because the whole cast combine flawlessly.Overflowing with memorable scenes (which should not be spoiled) and relentless entertainment Superbad continues to be a riot long after the credits have rolled. Superbad is something truly spectacular and was an intrepid business risk worth employing. Its success is overwhelming, but once seen it is easily understandable.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious....if you're a guy,"First off I am a guy and I found this hilarious. My significant other, however, felt like walking out of this movie after the first 10 minutes.The plot revolves around getting women too drunk to know what they're doing and then sleeping with them, so many women would probably feel a bit disgusted and objectified. Add to that all the colorful terms used to describe female genitalia and the fact that there aren't really any positive female role models in the movie (they all apparently just want to get drunk and get laid too) create a movie that women may find disgusting.

"Loved the message, but","It was really hard to know how to rate this movie. Had I not read lots of reviews and known that it was going to end up being a somewhat good movie, I may have left early. The first 30 minutes or so of the movie attempts to cram in as much offensive language as possible. The pornography references truly, truly offended me. However. Beneath all the shocking language, there truly is a heart. I found this movie to be surprisingly touching and sweet. They did ""go"" a few places I wish they hadn't. Every time I think I've seen it all, Hollywood adds in something new and more offensive than I've seen before. I can't help but wish they'd toned down the porn stuff and the language. Without it, there is still enough funny material for a good movie. So, I do recommend this to people who can get past the offensiveness, as I said, after the first half hour or so, it improves somewhat and there really is a nice story and a (gasp) good message in there.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It is certainly a funny and entertaining movie, but the potty humor can get a little old, and the parts with the two police officers seemed so much more broad than the rest of the movie that every time they cut to a scene with them, I felt like I was watching a different style of comedy. The best part of the movie is the three main characters. Their performances were great and you really cared about them as characters, which involved you in the story.

Coming of age film that entertains yet ends up emphasizing importance of choices made.,"I am certainly not a prude, however gross out films for purely comedic effect fall flat in my opinion. When it's a teen comedy it can be more so. That being said this movie rises above the vulgarity of off color language depicting two dependent best friends showing that (in the end) doing the right thing is more important than pursuing what your adolescent fantasies involve.That it gives credence to doing the right thing,IMO, makes it a better film. Not that it's not gross enough to be ""the best movie a 13-yr old has ever seen"", but it is filled with memorable characters who mimic real life types and situations as well as the obligatory absurd characters such as the two cops. It's not likely to be a comedic classic on the level of ""Animal House"", but it is funny, gross, and..., meh, sweet? How many comedies can you say that about? Kind of like if Me, Myself, and Irene were a teen comedy...but different. Glad to clear that up!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Superbad may not be as substandard as its title suggests, but it isn't exactly a drunkenly good time.","""Superoverrated"" would be more appropriate. Now, before everyone leaps to the defensive fence and starts abolishing my opinion, comedy is subjective. Superbad, in all its hormonal teen angst, will more than likely appeal to its target demographic of heterosexual males. That's not to say no one else can enjoy it, that's just the primary audience. I don't fit into that classification, which is why for most of the runtime, I found myself rarely relating to these buffoons. Two high school seniors are drifting apart as they continue on with their education and lives, to which they plan to have one booze-soaked night of boyish behaviour so that they can retain their friendship.Sex, drugs and alcohol. The three definitive elements found in most male-orientated teen comedies that have seen a popular rise ever since a certain pie got penetrated ('American Pie' if you didn't know...). However, what makes this one slightly more approachable is the cleverly executed arc that develops from this tricky friendship. When one friend doesn't get into further education, but the other friend does, it is sure to cause a rift. Seth and Evan present that scenario with a hint of humanism. When they're not attempting to steal alcohol or pressuring each other to illegally purchase liqueur, their bond can be rather expressive.Then incomes Fogell ""McLovin"" with his ridiculously amateur fake ID, to which the narrative seemingly splits apart and loses focus. A sub-plot involving two police officers (probably the funnier storyline...) and showing ""McLovin"" that cops can be fun, boisterously takes over the main plot. The spiky friendship between Seth and Evan dissipates and the supposedly infamous Rogen/Goldberg script nosedives into ""comedy"". As usual, I counted the amount of times I laughed, sniggered or smiled at the onscreen hilarity. You ready? Twice. Mostly from Hader's performance. But again, I have to reiterate, comedy is subjective and this type of hilarity doesn't work for me.What probably helped in my resistance to Superbad was the inclusion of Jonah Hill, an actor that I've never admired or even wanted to watch. As per usual, shouting every line of profanity in a monotonous tone and generally having a face that looks like a slapped bottom. Every time he was on screen, his character just made me sweat. No idea why, but I was uncomfortable with Seth as a character. The hyperbolic yearning for the female anatomy is never funny and is the complete opposite to relatable. Cera doesn't get off lightly either with his usual awkward persona. The constant barrage of camera shots that explicitly stares at female breasts is borderline objectification. Puberty is a wonderful thing, but so is subtlety. Mottola may have failed to grasp that on the odd occasion. And do not even get me started on Mintz-Plasse, otherwise we will be here all day.The most effective aspect to this comedy, aside from the infrequent witty lines of dialogue that everyone loves to quote, would be the final fifteen minutes. A surprisingly poetic representation of overcoming separation anxiety and that sudden click into adulthood. Mall escalators, you just saved Superbad from being, well, super bad.For the most part, when it's not focussing of sex jokes, the story is well formed and delivers some genuine moments of school life. But unfortunately it contains three lead actors who I generally dislike, mostly non-relatable scenarios and comedy that mostly misses for me. So whilst it didn't work for me personally, I can appreciate it is a well-made film that others have embraced. Phew, this review felt like presenting a defence case!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
My Favourite All Time Comedy Movie,"The interaction and script writing between the characters makes this the best comedy movie of all time.

How this is only 70th in the greatest comedy movies is beyond me.

A Lowbrow Comedy That Works--in Spite of Itself,"This film essentially begins with two inseparable high school friends named ""Evan"" (Michael Cera) and ""Seth"" (Jonah Hill) being invited to a party and then asked to furnish the alcohol for everyone. Being underage, they then turn to Evan's friend ""Fogell"" (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) to purchase it for them as he has just obtained a fake ID which he believes will be sufficient for the task at hand. However, when it appears that the police are apprehending him at the liquor store, both Evan and Seth become desperate and--for the first time in almost 10 years--go their separate ways. And it's during this time that they come to realize just how important their friendship really is. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this is one of those comedies that relies upon obscene language to generate laughter. This is especially true with Seth as everything he says is directly related to male and female genitalia or sex acts between genders. In short, his persona is tailor-made for a film targeting immature audiences. It isn't the first American film of this type, and I seriously doubt it will be the last. Having said that, however, the overall plot incorporated such a number of absurd situations that it actually worked--in spite of the lowbrow humor. This was actually a rather funny movie. Admittedly, I would have preferred a more measured script as the obscene language got a bit old rather quickly. But that's just me. Be that as it may, while I would definitely advise viewer discretion, I still found this movie to be rather entertaining, and I have rated it accordingly.

The idea of pairing two people together in the lead roles who are complete opposites was a brilliantly original idea. Hollywood should do it more often. Don't be surprised if you see it happening a lot from now on.So anyways, about this movie. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill play two guys with names I can't remember. They're on a mission from God that apparently involves lots of alcohol and getting laid while a third character inexplicably gets abducted by two very strange cops. OK, fair enough. However I can't give this movie a positive review because I really had to pee the whole time and thought I was going to die. I'm holding the cast and crew responsible for this and until they apologize they won't be getting an endorsement from me. You got that Seth Rogen? Michael Cera? You too fat kid and director guy.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Probably my favorite apple off of the Judd Apatow tree of comedy.,"In this crass in-your-face sex comedy, the thing that really makes it stand out to me (aside from the humor of course), is the subtext to everything we're watching. The problem with most movies like this is they have a-hole lead characters and they drift from gag to gag until a slapped on ending with fake sincerity in which the jerks we've been watching the entire film turn out to be great guys all along. However, with Superbad, I'm rooting for all of these characters from beginning to the end when we see schlubby Jonah Hill somehow land Emma Stone, I'm rolling with it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The new teen comedy to beat,"Fine comedic entry into the awkward teenage sex subgenre not only raises bars on portraying the realistic underpinnings of what it feels like to be confused, horny, and young in today's America, but also triumphantly parallels producer Judd Apatow's patented method of following up vulgarity with sincerity, tying it all around a day-in-the-life snapshot which further ensures cult demographic appreciation.Honestly, the movie may be worse off for how well rounded it was. Undoubtedly funniest in it's first act, Superbad becomes less personal and hilarious when the more plot-oriented, hi-jinks-ensuing second act, and tender third come into fruition. This isn't to say the material and great performances do not feel funny and fresh throughout. Merely it is to say that what could have been one of the funniest comedies to arrive in many, many moons trades in some superbly honed charm for a more emotionally satisfying and typically well-rounded experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Booze Quest,"I think I would have preferred that as a title as it was essentially a quest for booze. Although, it was only a means to an end. Getting laid was the real goal.I saw this movie in theatres just after I graduated and of course thought it was funny, though I just rewatched it for the first time in full since, and it was so much funnier. I must appreciate those times more now that they're gone and all. And just the mid 2000's in general. This was basically 'Dazed and Confused' of my generation. And it was all fairly accurate behaviour... minus the cops, except they were hilarious so all is forgiven.Michael Cera was already somewhat well known due to 'Arrested Development', but this was Jonah Hill's coming out party, and no doubt the stand out. His repetitive F-bomb throw downs, mostly done in anger never got old, they just got more funny. His career just took off afterwards, no shocker there.I am definitely glad I revisited this profanity ridden gem of a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"An uneven, but mostly hilarious high school comedy","Painfully awkward, but at times absolutely hilarious, Superbad goes for both the realistic and the outrageous sides of high school comedies, blending them together in one very unique package. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill lead the film and give some quite impressive performances, as awkward as they were. Infact, all the actors do a pretty impressive job all in all, which is tough for such a majority of them being younger actors. The film at times can be often hilarious, with jokes and situations so insane you can hardly even imagine without seeing them in the film. The film's biggest problem is its pacing, sometimes fast, other times slowing to a crawl, and its the slow moments that seem the worst because not only are they mostly humorless but they are painful to watch. I'm all for emotion in teen films, but Superbad decides to make the worst of each hard situation, and the film just feels like it is carrying too much at once. In the end, Superbad is a pretty impressive comedy, that could use some work in less comedic parts, but is full of just enough laughs and nostalgic humor that it will certainly win you over by the time the credits role.
My Rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Very funny at some parts, but not as hilarious as everyone claims.","I know I will get a lot of heat for saying so, but Superbad isn't as funny as everyone says. A film is truly hilarious to me if I can go in there alone, sit by myself, and still laugh out loud. For me, seeing funny movies with people makes them more funny. I only saw Superbad with one friend, and I never found myself laughing very hard save the drawings of the genitalia (I use genitalia to avoid getting pulled over by the administrators). That was truly hilarious...but besides that, the film consisted of a bunch of just funny scenes.Maybe my expectations are too high. I love these kinds of movies. I love movies that use the f-word, bathroom humor, what have you that also have good scripts. For example, I am a big fan of Kevin Smith, but found his movies to be superior to Superbad.See this movie with people, crazy people, a lot of crazy people, and maybe Superbad will be the awesome experience it is supposed to be.7/10, I won't deny that the characters were awesome, namely McLovin and the cops.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It wasn't super but it was bad,"Giving it 1 and even that's generous. Grossly overrated movie i've ever came across, really makes me question people's morality and intelligence at the same point. Looking at it as a female made me scared. Seeing that nothing has changed, women are still inferior and only serve for some sexual object and that is it. Ugly guy gets a model looking girl...but could an ugly girl get a model looking guy? It's pure brainwashing, seeding false morality and abominated view upon women. I really am scared it got such high rating...what kind of a person thinks this is even remotely funny? I'm not a Christian i'm not 60 years old either. I'm 24 and a female and i do have values that seem to be lost or rare to find in this days society. Sadly. If you have similar point of view as i do don't even bother with this garbage of a movie.

Remembering what being a teenager feels like,"Taking this movie within it's coming of age comedy genre, I feel it's one of the best ever made.Judging by the fact that more than 10 years after seeing this I still remember a lot of funny scenes and quotes, makes me think that it was a memorable and entertaining experience.The interactions between the three protagonists shows the story of friendship in the trouble world of teenagers. Everyone tries to act cool, but deep down no one really is and that contrast is shown superbly.
The three friends are on a confidence roller-coaster that should transport any viewer to their teenage years.I feel this movie also single-handedly shot up Jonah Hill and Emma Stone's career. I don't remember much of their work before this, but I remember a lot afterwards. Given that it wasn't very dramatic and it wasn't set up in the best way to show acting qualities, that alone should tell you something about the quality of the script.Probably the only reason people snubbed their noses at this is that they didn't take it for what it is and wanted something sophisticated.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"As Mel Brooks said about ""The Producers"", the film rises below vulgarity...","""Superbad"" is a teen-comedy overloaded with all the raunchiness and naughty humor you'd expect in the chronological vicinity than ""American Pie"" and those youth movies that pululated in the early 2000s (overlapping with straight horror through ""Final Destination"" or comedic with ""Scary Movie""). And yet it managed to rise itself above the usual farces that have no pretension to go beyond their demographic target and provide something as funny as a parody, but smarter. In fact, it is parodic in the way it subverts many tropes of ""wild nights"" films à la Richard Linklater's ""Dazed and Confused"" but without betraying a spirit that makes fun of kids while respecting and forgiving them.Take a scene like the ""McLovin"" fake ID, which can easily be regarded as one of the top 20 most emblematic 2000s movie moments: that scene's not funny alone because it turns a common teen-situation into something of a sitcom level (though the Hawaiian organ donor with a unique name à la 'Seal' is really something) but it's funny because it's played straight by the three characters. Fogell aka McLovin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) sticks to his guns and even rationalizes the second name option. Seth (Jonah Hill) is shocked by Fogell's obliviousness and expresses it with loud angry tirades full of F-bombs. Evan (Michael Cera) is the voice of reason but even his words fail to flap Fogell's confidence of his genius.Any lesser comedy would have made the 'McLovin' thing a revelation, but Greg Mottola's film makes the situation work on three levels: it's the set-up, the joke and the punchline that provokes the intervention of the two cops (Seth Rogen who wrote the film and Bill Hader) and enhances the film's hilarity with two unexpected additions. The incident also sets up the whole chain of events that will make Seth and Evan believe their friend has been arrested so they could go find another way to get the booze. Evan is by the way the name of Rogen's co-writer Goldberg and the story was based on their teen memories. And what they created was a fun comedy where the booze will matter less than the journey during which Seth and Evan will settle a few records and discuss the limits of their co-dependent friendship (and a few other things).Meanwhile, it's Fogell/McLovin who has the time of his life with the two cops whose intervention will awake their youth memories, and the result is a gag-driven night with a few interesting insights about the social function of partying, especially if we talk of the last night before school is off. To some degree, ""Superbad"" can be regarded as a fine and clever mix between ""last night"" classic ""Dazed and Confused"" and the first ""American Pie"" which was also about boys aiming to lose their virginity before getting to university, which (let's face it) was one of the big issues of a young male in his early adulthood.The comparison with ""American Pie"" is even more relevant because the film doesn't make fun of girls, though it portrays them as a sort of vehicles to fulfill guy's fantasies. Still, it's obvious from the start that the misconception of girls denounces the boys lack of maturity. But if that's played straight by Seth, the character of Evan provides a fine subversion because he does have a crush on a girl but doesn't rely on alcohol to get her. Seth's crush Jules (Emma Stone) also corrects his conception by mentioning she doesn't need intoxicationd and she might think of sex if the partner isn't inebriated. Let that be a lesson to immature shy boys who needs social fuel and given the recent 'date rapes' scandals, the angle taken by ""Superbad"" proves not only to be insightful and respectful but also salutary for the film's legacy.Indeed, whether you think you need to be drunk to get the girl or that she should be drunk, ""Superbad"" does come with respectful answers that tie every element of the plot together without putting girls on a symbolic pedestal either, they can have as much immaturity and insecurity as their fellow guys. It also shows a strong friendship being undermined by two existential issues when we say goodbye to the teenage years: girls and studies. The director handles the script with a sharp but tender eye, he seems to go for the over-the-top raunchy comedy at times but""Superbad"" ends up being as sweet and heart-warming as ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"". It is really a high point in teen comedies, that allowed two actors to bloom: two-time Oscar-nominee Jonah Hill and three-time nominee and Oscar-winner Emma Stone. That's how old the film is; and how better it'll get with time, like a good wine or a Goldslick Vodka.And the cast looks all like teenagers despite being in their early 20s (except for McLovin) and once again, a bad comedy might have cast Seth Rogen in the titular role, the film didn't fall in that trap.Now, the film refreshed many memories that I have already mentioned them in ""Lady Bird"", I laughed loud at the obvious gags but also for subtle moment like like the market vendor, and subtle moments like the vest or when Seth puts on Evan's father clothes, because I'm guilty of having used adult clothes and even a vest to look more adult. As for the obsession with ""losing it"" or the misconception of alcohol as a romantic tool, I'm glad a film took that up to eleven, showing that there's not much equity between boys and girls on that level. And it's only fair to have a few laughs about that.And the film is funny, over-the-top and its satisfying coming-of-age ending makes up for the bits of naughtiness. And the ending drawing montage is the icing of the cake, showing the writing talent of Rogen and Goldberg, who raises a monument of vulgarity and bad taste to a high level of fun, like Mel Brooks with ""The Producers"".",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The raunchiest teen movie yet and it lives up to the title,"Words can't express how happy I am that ""Superbad"" exists. The first time I saw it left me with a wide smile grinning from ear to ear after I walked out the theatre. Probably the best thing to come along all summer. ""Superbad"" is another comedy that comes to us courtesy of Judd Apatow,the director of ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"",and ""Knocked Up"",the other great comedy of the summer of 2007. He was also behind the successful ""Talladega Nights"",last summer's comedy smash starring Will Ferrell. This time around Apatow only produces the film;the movie is expertly directed by Greg Mottola,who helmed many episodes of Apatow's short-lived Fox sitcom, ""Undeclared"". The real reason why the film ""Superbad"" has an ""R"" rating? Where ""Knocked Up""(which was also ""R"" rated) was sweet and occasionally profane,""Superbad"" is raging dirty and persistently foul mouthed and this was why this film is full of it including some strong language,not to mention scenes of heavy drinking and some graphic content and sexual references-all involving teens. Written by ""Knocked"" star Seth Rogen and his buddy Evan Goldberg,this was a movie that basically captures all the awkwardness of the teenage experience,and yet still manages to be as screwball and hyper-exaggerated as a Mad magazine layout. However,director Greg Mottola is visiting familiar territory here which is the high school hijinks movies which has been a staple of other teen-oriented movies from ""American Graffiti"" to ""American Pie"".Here everyone is reliable and the situations rarely feel strained which makes ""Superbad"" a cut above every other teen farce film you'll see this year and is above most of the teen-oriented movies that I have seen not to mention one of the funniest high school movies since the original ""Porky's"" and to an lesser extent ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High""(or to an lesser extent ""Superbad"" pays homage to those teen comedies from the 1980's and 1990's). ""Superbad"" is both upfront and deceptive. The movie's raunch factor is so high and in-your-face that the gags depicted are too intense,but it helps with the hilariousness that ensumes. But there's more meaningful issues and amid the potty humor and outlandish sex jokes concerning female body parts. But it also delves with the joys of growing up as well and facing the prospects of adulthood. But let's not forget,the movie is flat out funny as all get out. But there are also some scenes that are as just as hilarious as they get and you'll be laughing out loud at some of the mischief these kids get into just to be in the crowd and crash the party and not to mention getting next to the hottie of their dreams. A smart as hell not to mention extreme vulgar,sidesplittingly funny that is one of the most enjoyable I had in ages and just to let you know this film has scenes of drug usuge too all involving teens. The funniest film you'll will see all year.",,Anonymous,Comedy
A Hilarious Coming-of-Age Comedy with an 8/10 Rating,"Superbad earns a solid 8/10 for its hilarious portrayal of teenage antics and relatable coming-of-age struggles.

7.9/10,"Easy 7.9/10, Superbad is as simple as it gets: just some high school kids trying to get alcohol for a party. That's it. That's the whole movie. And yet, somehow, it becomes this ridiculous, chaotic adventure where everything that could possibly go wrong does, sending them on the most absurd side quests imaginable.The plot is so linear it's almost funny, there's no complexity, no deep subplot, no big revelations. It's just one mission: buy booze. But the brilliance is in how the movie constantly derails that mission, dragging the characters into insane situations that spiral out of control. Every detour makes things worse (or funnier). Whether it's McLovin getting involved with reckless cops or Seth and Evan stumbling into bizarre parties, the movie thrives on its unpredictability.The characters? Absolutely fantastic. Jonah Hill's Seth is loud, impulsive, and completely delusional about how things work. Michael Cera's Evan is awkward, nervous, and somehow even more clueless. And then there's McLovin, instantly iconic, a walking disaster, plainly brilliant. They're exaggerated but never feel fake, just perfectly exaggerated versions of real high schoolers who think they have life figured out but clearly don't.The film also does humour well! Rare to see in cinema, but there's no cringe; none that wasn't intentional, at least. Hilarious from start to finish. The dialogue is fast, sharp, and often absurd, packed with lines that feel completely natural yet ridiculous at the same time. It never slows down, never loses momentum. Every joke lands because it feels like something real teenagers would actually say, just put more theatrically.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Besides that, it's an simple 2000s movie son don't expect it to be inclusive.

Brilliant script,"This is the wittiest film to come out this year. The jokes are original and the script excellent. Don't be fooled by the trailers though, this isn't another teen movie in the vein of American Pie. Here, the main story is about male bonding. The plot is good, however it is the closeness between the two main characters that makes this film unforgettable. Breaking from the preachy ""what's the moral of this story"" norm, by the end of the film nothing new has been learnt by the main characters  it is the viewer who has learnt (or been reminded) of how close friends can be. The film is a snapshot of their relationship, which feels genuine and real.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny with (thankfully) few redeeming factors,"This is easily the best film I've seen from Judd Apatow's stable. Crude, but not dumb, and with plenty of laughs. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera provide most of the highlights. Hill in particular is funny for the whole movie, a feat that John Belushi often struggled to achieve. The only major fault is that it goes on too long, the last 20 minutes feeling drained - this is a fault it shares with ""Knocked Up"". As a comedy this is much better than ""Juno"", it also feels much more real than that overpraised cute fest. If you think that a comedy's main function is to make you laugh, then this was the best American comedy of 2008.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny and engaging teen comedy,"Superbad 2007, 118mins, 15 Director: Greg Mottola Cast includes: Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Bill Hader, Christopher Mintz-PlasseIt's really been Judd Apatows year, the comedy guru steered Knocked Up to #2 in the US domestic charts bettered only by the pirate fuelled adventures of Johnny Depp and co. on it's opening weekend. Then several weeks later Superbad hit theatres this time with Apatow producing, the magic still hit home the feature managed to take $32 million on it's opening weekend alone, on a mere $20 million budget. Both pictures also drew great reviews marking a mammoth year for Apatow, and based on Superbad he probably deserves mucho credit. The film depicts two pals Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) very different people in one grossly over dependent friendship. Seth is foul mouthed and obsessed with sex, Evan is more controlled and a lot less crazy about intercourse. Both are socially outcast but when invited to the last big party before they graduate the boys and their nerdy tag along Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) acquire a fake I.D and attempt to get a massive booze haul, so as to impress the girls they like and try to lose that one thing all teenage boys want to see the back off. Their virginity. The film is set really into two stories that off Seth and Evan which eats up two thirds of the screen time, and that of Fogell and two lovable but inept cops played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader. The two are conjoined at the beginning and at the end, but the middle section splices between the two. The film is written in the same crude but clever manner that films like American Pie and The 40 year Old Virgin (another Apatow product) big hits in recent years. It's nice to see a teen comedy that whilst containing all the same elements of the genre, also has a heart, soul and some extremely familiar situations and gags. Films like Road Trip, Pledge This and Van Wilder only maintain half of that equation and as a result are only ever half as good as Superbad indeed in the case of the Paris Hilton DTV movie, they can be a lot worse than even that. The performances are all excellent, Hill can be a tad irritating at times but it's well tempered by Cera's always charming turn. The two share great chemistry, the audience truly believes in their 10 year friendship. As Fogell Christopher Mintz-Plasse really gets the majority of the laughs, he's not a character with any real emotional core but his hilarious I.D (he names himself only McLovin) and his antics with Rogen and Hader are just about the funniest things in the film. Speaking of that duo they're also very good, particularly Hader as the more unstable of the two. One of the key problems the film has is it's lack of development with any female characters. The two chicks the lead duo are after are good looking and pleasant but nothing more. The young actresses do fine with the material I expect they where given, it's just the material itself feels light in the load. The jokes are usually amusing with several laugh out loud moments interspersed within the movie. Obviously a few gags don't work (a sequence involving a young child drawing dicks didn't do it for me) but generally the observations made by screenwriters Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen are funny, witty and surprisingly affecting and familiar. Within the Summer it was released I found only The Simpsons Movie funnier. At two hours director Greg Mottola lets the film drag on 10 minutes to long, but to make the emotional points he needs the man is right to take the picture past the standard 90 minute runtime for this sort of fare. Some parties have read into a gay subtext within the production, I didn't pick up on that, just that these where two friends very close to each other. Seeing as the film also points out that both guys are going to different colleges, the film also deals with the partition of this friendship. Some of the conversations surrounding this are really well done and tug a little at the audience's heart strings. Superbad has a few flaws but none are fatal. The film is funny and emotionally engaging which is what it really needs to be, and thus some of the dud jokes and 2-D characters are easy to forgive. The film offers enjoyment and a little more, which is much more than most of it's over stuffed genre can muster. It ain't Supergood, but I'd certainly give it a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The movie is full of cringe humor and ridiculous circumstance, it's essentially designed so the characters have a good story to tell later on, and it definitely meets the criteria. The big problem is that it's a high school, ""let's get laid adventure"" starring 2 idiots and their idiot friend. I've never seen 2 guys work so hard to prevent themselves from their actual goal.When you look a little closer too, it's really two movies wrapped around each other.

Surprisingly painful.,"It is with a great deal of surprise and disappointment that I have a negative review of Superbad. Many of my friends own this movie and were certain that I would love it; it was on their recommendations that we rented this piece of garbage yesterday and I want my 118 minutes back! Truth be told, I laughed out loud, and hard, several times, but as the movie plodded on, the laughs got to be fewer and fewer until I finally gave up hope in this truly awful film. We weren't expecting much of a plot, and we didn't get one. We expected lowbrow comedy, lots of sex jokes, and underage drinking. Check, check, and check. What we didn't expect were ponderous scenes that went far too long for the humor available, pointless scenes with irrelevant characters that did nothing to enhance the story or the laughs.

"Coming of age comedy; original, but same vein as 'Porkys'","So catching this in 2020, I'm well over the targeted age demographic for this movie.Having been a teenager in the 1980's the movie equivalent of this would have been 'Porkys' IMHO.

However, the recurrent themes were laboured (e.g trying to buy alcohol underage, losing one's virginity) and left me feeling that this could have been considerably shortened from its 1h 50 to 1h 30m.All in all, probably better suited (and indeed intended) for the teens to twenties age group",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
one of the best this summer,OK to start off this was a good movie not like some of the lame movies to have been out during this summer. not just some pot head humor either. (hate those movies) basically the two main actors have a separation problem and it goes even more crazy with all the antics that are thrown in with it. GREAT MOVIE a must see funny and you wont be disappointed. although i must admit it will be hard to watch at some scenes with the main feeling that you get towards this movies can sum that up. the camera work and cast was amazingly talented and they can make you laugh with out having to do much. one of the few best movies that has come out this summer.,8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Reallybad,Another teenager partying movie...I found the characters and dialogues a bit shallow and the uninspired script lacking in entertainment value.

"Self Explanatory, SUPERBAD","SuperBad, what can I say? I saw an advanced screening last night,(I waited 2 extra hours because the film was late on arrival) and I was very pleased. I had SUPER high expectations for this movie because I'm a fan of 40 year old virgin and knocked up. This movie definitely lived up to them. Being a senior in high school this year, I can only hope i have as much fun as these guys do in this movie.

Completely overrated. Superbad really is 'Super-Bad',"This is a movie I wish I'd never spent my hard earned money on. Believe me, I have seen LOTS of movies, especially comedies and this is one of the WORST I have ever had to suffer through. I kept watching hoping it'd get better but it didn't. The characters are annoying. You just want to scream 'LOSER' at them throughout. The dialogue consists mostly of all the curses you can think of. I must say, curses can work, because I quite enjoyed 40-Year Old Virgin, but in this movie, it's just pointless and makes you want to shove a soap down their throat.I usually look for something good in even the most horrible movies, but this - this has nothing good that I can say about it.

Best Comedy since Billy Madison,"Okay, there have been plenty of good comedies since Billy Madison, but this is tops. If you enjoyed Jonah Hill in Accepted, his performance in Superbad blows it out of the water. After seeing the overplayed previews of this movie on TV, the computer, and everywhere else I looked, I began to think, ""Here comes another movie where every funny part is spoiled by seeing them beforehand (i.e. Blades of Glory)"" But boy was i wrong. Each scene in the movie seems to be funnier than the last, which is saying a lot considering I was laughing out loud after the opening scene. The addition of quick-witted, slightly moronic police officers Slater and Michaels (Bill Hader and Seth Rogan) only adds to the laugh-a-minute comedy in this film. The way Hill and Cera are able to feed off each other in such a humorous way is genius. After reading the other comments made for this film, I couldn't help but to make the obvious comparison to the American Pie films. Superbad is on a whole other level.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Up there with the Top 10 funniest movies of all time!,"Okay. So, I was extremely excited going into this movie for a variety of reasons, a few being Michael Cera, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill and the fact that Judd Apatow was involved and Seth Rogen had written this movie. This movie is the funniest movie of the summer and the year. The laughs never stop coming. There were a handful of moments where I couldn't hear a joke because the audience and myself were still laughing from the first joke. This movie is witty, which I love, and it is just an all around good, funny, well written ""teen sex party"" movie. If you are a fan of any of Judd Apatow or Seth Rogen's movies, you will love Superbad. Oh, and I feel I MUST comment on Christopher Mintz-Plasse's performance in this movie. For a first time movie actor, he was spectacular! GO SEE SUPERBAD NOW!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I laughed hard and often,"There are many different kinds of comedies out there. Some that make you smile, some that make you chuckle occasionally, and then the actual funny ones that make you laugh out loud. Superbad is one of those. I went to see this movie because of Michael Cera who I thought was the funniest person on the funniest television series in history, ""Arrested Development"". And he's hilarious in this as well, but so are all three of the lead characters. I'd nominate them for something if I could.I grew up in the 80s when movies about kids trying to ""lose it"" before graduation seemed like it's own genre. So I was interested to see an update since I figured the newer generation were already grandparents at 25. Well it's good to see that nerds are still nerds and the entire populace hasn't gone crazy. It was interesting also because the people in it who are my age, like Rogen and Hader, are clearly the old people trying to recapture their youth, when I think most of us haven't completely grown up yet. It was sort of painful to see how the movie-isms we find funny are just old to the new kids. But this movie is definitely fun for people in their 30s we just have to realize that we're not them anymore and I think it helps. And it's smart. The jokes are really sharp and you have to listen because they almost roll into each other.There is a lot of cursing in this movie and I only say that because I know someone who doesn't like that sort of thing. If I didn't know someone like that I probably wouldn't notice. But since I do if you're one of those people that might bother you. And although the goal of the main characters is sex, it isn't a sex comedy in the traditional sense. It's mostly a quest for booze. And there is one thing that's kinda gross but I don't know how to describe it without spoiling it. But if any of that bothers you enough to deter from seeing this, I can't imagine you'd be interested in this anyway. Otherwise I think it'd be fun for anyone from 13-45 with a sense of humor.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Spiritual Successor to Can't Hardly Wait,"High school seniors Evan and Seth (Jonah Hill and Michael Cera), who had spent their years pining for girls but never chasing them, are about to graduate and go their separate ways, worlds apart. But before they go off to college, it's time for that one last high school party. The booze, the women and more... they are ready to become adults.Let me lay it out there: ""Superbad"" is the spiritual successor to ""Can't Hardly Wait"", which is the spiritual successor to ""Say Anything"". This is a blessing and a curse. The blessing is we have the same concept that works time and again: the end of the high school years and a big party where the losers and nerds have to redeem themselves. Lloyd Dobbler (John Cusack) did it with Ione Skye, Ethan Embry's character did it with Jennifer Love Hewitt. Now Seth and Evan have that chance with Becca and Jules (Emma Stone). And this formula always works. (Also, these films tend to have good music. ""Superbad"" really taps the Bar-Kays, which is a wise move and a dang fine opening song.) The bad? Each reincarnation seems to be weaker, a copy of a copy (like ""Multiplicity""). I liked ""Superbad"", but it didn't have all the iconic moments ""Can't Hardly Wait"" had. And before that, ""Say Anything"" will always be remembered for the boombox scene with Peter Gabriel. Even the best scenes of ""Superbad"" are disposable, and some of the best jokes (drunk cops, for example) are nothing new. The only really great parts are the rambles between Evan and Seth.As a side note, I have to call attention to the girl who played Becca and state for the record how hot she is and how I feel she has a strong future. She's like the younger Alysson Hannigan, which we needed. And by being cast in the remake of ""Last House on the Left"", her acting career is cemented so long as they are able to make that film half as powerful as the original (a difficult task).I highly recommend ""Superbad"", though if you're looking for a 2007 teenager movie, ""Juno"" should really be your primary choice. And if you like Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen, I cannot say that this is better than ""Knocked Up"". Maybe marginally, but only because this has more repeat viewing value. And I do fear that future collaborations will simply diminish... Judd Apatow is a ticking time bomb (though still strong as of July 2010).",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Truthful Comedy,"I didn't know what to expect from this film but was pleasantly surprised. Seth, a high school senior two weeks from graduation has never actually been laid and desperately wants to to prepare himself (sexually) for college. Despite being an overweight, swearing, porn-loving yet somewhat sensitive mess of a teenager, he eyes baby-faced Jules as his destined conquest. However, he knows a hot girl like that will probably have nothing to do with him beyond casual conversation so he hopes to get her drunk and be the 'mistake' she regrets later. A mistake that he hopes will lead her to being his girlfriend for at least another two months before they part ways for college. Through all this, Seth has to deal with separating with his best friend, Evan who's going to a different college. An adventure ensues for Seth, Evan and their underrated third wheel of a friend, Fogell as they struggle to get enough alcohol to Jules' party, their ticket to getting laid. Two young and nutty cops add some remarkable fun to the whole plot. The dialog is well-scripted and honest. I found myself being able to relate to a lot of it (being kind of like Seth myself).",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Funny, unless you're really prejudiced about it","The majority of the people who criticize this movie so heavily are blocked by their prejudice and unintelligent enough to never ever question that maybe the point of this movie wasn't to deliver a great 'plot', that nobody went to see this movie for it to deliver some amazing 'dialogue' etc. I see people whining about how ""me and my wife"" just wanted to get out of the theatre. Well, did it ever occur to you that maybe this isn't exactly something you'd wanna watch with your wife or husband? That maybe you're just not the target audience? That maybe you don't GET what's so funny about some of these scenes? These inabilities are proved by all the false statements about the content of this film. For example did Seth and Evan really have a mission to have sex before they graduated? NO, THEY DIDN'T, and this is obvious to anyone who watched the movie without a prejudiced, high-mighty attitude.If you haven't seen it yet, Superbad is just a pretty mindless comedy. Actually it sort of does have a plot, which is the friendship of Seth and Evan that is about to be broken as they will enter college, but that part only brings down the movie in my opinion; it's boring. It probably is a bit of a 'guy movie', and my guess is that if you're 30+ or more, you're less likely to enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Excellent in every way,"With the charm of Linklater's dazed and confused and the wit of any Rogan/Apatow movie in recent history, this day long triumph of a film is rolling in jokes and steeped in awkward but hilarious acting. The film delivers so many knockout punches that you come out of the theater your head swarming with moments that you know you almost died laughing at but can't even remember the punchline. The R rating is rightfully deserved, but the gratuitous f bombing by Jonah Hill comes off as natural and easy. Michael Cera's quirky shyness comes off as authentic and empathetic while McLovin's weird self confidence is oddly disarming and as said by the cast itself, 'Can only be explained by him having a large (Explitve Deleted).

One of the best teen comedy!!!!!,"Operating under the assumption that by procuring alcohol for an upcoming party they will finally be able to break their longstanding losing streak with the fairer sex, socially inept high school seniors Evan (Michael Cera) and Seth (Jonah Hill) set out to secure the adult beverages that could get them off of the geek list before they even attend college orientation. Evan is a bright young student whose outward sweetness belies his suffocating fear of heading off to college without his lifelong best friend Seth -- a hormone-driven mischief-maker who wasn't accepted to the same school as Evan. But Evan and Seth both know that college is a place of personal reinvention, and that if they are able to make that first leap together they will have forged a bond powerful enough to last a lifetime. Meanwhile, Evan and Seth's friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) acquires a hastily rendered fake I.D. that instantly endears him to a pair of truly irresponsible cops (Bill Hader and Seth Rogen). Penned by co-star Rogen in collaboration with former Da Ali G Show co-writer Evan Goldberg, the semi-autobiographical SuperBad was produced by Judd Apatow and directed by Greg Mottola -- who previously helmed episodes of Undeclared and Arrested Development.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Superbad-Superawsome can't begin to describe it...,"Honestly, having just graduated from high school, I might find this movie better than others.

Nothing new here,"Comedy about three nerdy teenage boys about to graduate from high school. Naturally they're all virgins and naturally they want to have sex before graduating. There's the thin shy guy (Michael Cera), the fat foul-mouthed guy (Jonah Hill) and the nerd with glasses (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). They have tiredly obvious misadventures on the night of a big party.How did this get to be such a huge hit? The story and jokes are old and obvious. ALL of this has been done to death and this adds absolutely nothing new. I saw the ending coming a mile away. To make matters worse you don't like any of these kids. Cera is blank the entire movie. He basically says his lines with no expression--ever. Hill easily plays one of the most obnoxious characters ever. He's always insulting, always swearing (he uses the word ""f***"" nonstop) and is just grating. I kept wondering why Cera put up with him at all. Mintz-Plasse overdoes his nerdy character far too well. The movie isn't a total washout however. Bill Hader (looking like a very young Dan Aykroyd) and Seth Rogan are very funny as police officers Slater and Michaels. They manage to make even the tired lines they're given seem funny. Also I did smile a few times and the supporting cast was very attractive and appealing. So it's OK but you've seen this all before. I give it a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Super-Hilarious,"This is definitely one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time, and also one of the most realistic regarding high school teens and their escapades. I saw it when it got released, and I thought it was good. But last night, I wanted a DVD to watch, went to the local DVD shop, and decided to watch it again. And bugger me, it was even better the second time around. Sure, its crude and raunchy, but it still manges to display just the right amount of sentimentality between friends.Two final-year students prepare for the party of the year, and both have high hopes of ""scoring"" with their respective crushes. As is the norm with these movies, nothing goes according to plan and some difficult lessons are learnt in the process. Refreshingly, it's all handled so well. The two leads, Jonah Hill and Michael Cera, are both destined for great comedic futures. They have impeccable timing and the gift for slapstick comedy. Cera might be duplicating his George-Michael character from Arrested Development, but so what? He plays it brilliantly. But the actor who really has you splitting your sides is young Christopher Mintz-Plasse, playing a dorky loser. Chances are you knew someone like this at school, and he plays it so that you realise that a kid like this could have been one of your best friends. He makes you laugh, but out in the real world he still needs all the help he can get.All-in-all, a fantastic teen comedy. A step up from American Pie, even though you might feel you've seen it all before. So watch it, and relive those awkward high school moments you can now laugh about.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The latest information gives you a pretty clear idea of what to expect from this film. Just remember the stories you told with your friends during puberty and you will have a rough concept of the plot. A whole range of puberty-driven teens, led by Jonah Hill and Michael Cera, in pretty imaginative and fun tongue-in-cheek situations and conversations will probably keep your attention for a full two hours and, if you don't expect too much, you'll have a good time.

"7.5/10 -SuperBAD? More like SuperFUN, amiright?","Hahaha...okay, had to get this out of my system. Sorry, folks.Anyway! Superbad is a teen comedy written by Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg, and it's loosely based on their experience in high school. So, yeah, that's why the two main characters are named Seth and Evan.The plot follows Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera), two good friends in their final year of high school, as they're trying to get alcohol for a graduation party with the help of a third friend, Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). On the way, of course, they try to lose their virginity on this graduation party, thinking that getting the alcohol will help them with that.Sounds pretty typical, right? A normal, dumb teen comedy, with a lot of dirty jokes and forgettable character. A good way to pass two hours, and that's it.Well, people, think again. This film is actually kinda good.Each character is so iconic and fun, and is actually deeper than you'd expect. Not like, Amadeus or Requiem for a Dream level deep, but as the movie goes on we learn about their insecurities and relationships, and, well, it kinda turns into a pretty cute coming-of-age story.The soundtrack is awesome, I really think that each song here is super fitting to the film, and yeah. Really funky.The casting is *cheff kiss *, too, and it enhances the hilarious dialogue so much. The delivery of each line is super on-point. Bill Hader and Seth Rogan as the two cops are actually the most fun thing in the whole film (at least up there, I'd say), too.And, you know, maybe this film doesn't have a mind blowing cinematography, tons of quotable moments or a huge twist, but it works just fine as it is. Yeah, some of the jokes might not work at times, but the jokes come in such a steady stream, and most of the time are super consistent, so I can't really say that the film has scenes that are super weak from start to finish.It's just a fun, well written and iconic teen comedy, with great characters, writing...I'll just say that as for me, it's kinda as good as this genre, with this kind of jokes and theme, gets.Yet, not a mind blowing experience, but a hella solid one.

This film is hilarious if it's the sort of thing you like,"The reviews of this film are really not very helpful as they are completely polarised between 9/10 star ratings and 1/2 stars so I thought I'd have a go at being less biased.This film is no enigma. The humour is very immature (sexual, crude and and full of F bombs), the story is very simple and the characters too are by no means spectacular. The acting is good and Jonah Hill and Michael Cera definitely pull off the ""sexually frustrated teenager"" very well, though I suspect that these characters are not far from their actual personalities. The type of comedy in this film is probably what I would refer to as ""bland American"" (we don't have films like this made in the UK), meaning no subtlety and usually bad/over use of curse words or other rude or sex related words. Basically the kind of things you expect to hear from a 15 year old. The characters in this film also remind me of all the things I hate about teenagers (I should probably mention now that I am one); the obsession with alcohol, the obsession with sex, needless swearing and the constant abuse of each other amongst other things. This is the worst film for the average parent and those who always have to critically analyse all films.though this may all sound negative, but this is actually one of my all time favourite films and I know a lot of other people who love it. It is a film which is not really to be taken seriously. Think Back to the Future; simple, predictable, fun and pleasing but instead for generally a more teenage audience. To summarise: I love it, my parents... not so much.It's not to make you think, it's to make you not think and just have a good laugh and enjoy a easy going film.My conclusion is that to enjoy this film you have to switch off your ""quality humour"" filter and laugh at the things you think you shouldn't find funny and you'll probably find that there IS a part of you that does think it's funny or at least appreciates the humour.

"Derivative, raunchy adventure with a sprinkling of inventiveness","I will get some flak for saying this(if people actually do read this rubbish), but I think Superbad is an aggressively average film, redeemed only by one or two positive aspects. Superbad is problematic because it falls into the trap of being cliche and derivative- its themes deal with parties, with raunchy sex, and with alcohol, which are themes which are so overused and so trite. It has plenty of cringe worthy moments, and is overall, a ridiculous, fantastical film. In how its story is set up and progresses to an unbelievably wild, ludicrous night, it loses a great deal of realism. But it does trade it in with a sprinkling of fun or entertainment, which is a good thing I guess. It's characters are also not very cleverly written- they are stock characters, in that we essentially follow the night of three sex mad, raunchy, but unpopular and desperate boys, one of which is assertive but totally vulgar, and the other is shy and a bit of a nerd. Indeed, perhaps the only redeeming feature of the film is that it is inventive in its comedy. The films humour is very vulgar and very horny, material bordering on Borat territory, which is to say, sometimes very very funny. It also has no problem holding an audiences attention for two hours. But the film shows too much of its nature and its foundations- when stripped down, this film follows a cliche narrative seen countless other times, of boys desperate for a bit of naughty time with the girls, with a tad of wholesome friendship thrown in for artificial depth. It's only novel ideas are in its sharp, crude dialogue. An average film redeemed only by a sprinkling of inventiveness.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The two funniest characters in this movie are easily the cops, played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader. But the story around the two main characters is very funny as well. However, this is not the funniest movie I've ever seen and it's not even the funniest of 2007 (that would be Knocked Up). It probably is the second funniest, which is still quite a statement. The one reason that Superbad failed to exceed ""Kocked Up"" is maturity. Whenever you hear a funny joke, the fact that it's actually mature can make it even funnier. Knocked Up got immature at times, but was also a very coming-of-age type of romance movie. It feels weird saying that, but it is true. But anyway, Superbad, definitely go see it.

That's because there is too stark a contrast between the over-the-top hi-jinks that prevail over most of the running time and the almost whimsically co-dependent way the relationship between the two best friends reveals itself to be. My expectations ran high given that filmmaker Judd Apatow produced the film, and as he proved with ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"", he can bring unexpected heart into the most absurdly comical of situations. However, this delicate balancing act is what seems missing here since he let director Greg Motolla take over the reins this time. Aspiring to be more like ""American Graffiti"" than ""American Pie"", the result is a film with plenty of laughs but fares less in terms of lasting emotional resonance.From a script penned by best friends Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (based on their own awkward adolescent years), the movie has a slim premise  chubby, potty-mouthed Seth and shy, geeky Evan are best friends about to graduate from high school and go to different colleges. Evan got accepted to Dartmouth, while Seth is going to the local community college. Seth, however, has a twist of good luck when he is partnered in home economics class with Jules, one of the school's coolest girls, who invites him and Evan to a big graduation blow-out at her parents' house. So hopped up by his sexual fantasies about Jules, Seth volunteers to take her food allowance and buy liquor for the party. Evan goes along with the shenanigans because he has a crush on Jules' best friend Becca, a good girl who actually likes him. Getting the alcohol is not easy because it means bringing nerdy Fogell into the mix since he has a fake ID that says he is 25, lives in Hawaii and his name is McLovin (just one name please). Needless to say, everything that could go wrong does, and the story splinters between Fogell's adventure with two irresponsible policemen and Seth and Evan's search for alcohol when they think Fogell has been arrested.A spirited cast displays crack comic timing. Jonah Hill, already familiar as one of the slacker housemates in ""Knocked Up"", plays Seth with hormonally-driven brio, while Michael Cera (the put-upon son George-Michael in ""Arrested Development"" and now shining in ""Juno"") makes Evan a quietly affecting dweeb. In his film debut, Christopher Mintz-Plasse is a hilarious scene stealer as Fogell. Rogen (with a Fu Manchu moustache) and SNL's Bill Hader display a playful rapport as the police officers who show Fogell how to have a good time, and among the three actresses playing the girls the nerd brigade desires, Emma Stone is a particular standout as the sensible Jules. The drawings reflecting Seth's obsession are hysterically funny, as is the entire liquor store episode. It's too bad that the film feels overlong at nearly two hours, but I do applaud the sheer audacity and emotional transparency of the last scenes.Plenty of extras come with the two-disc Unrated and Extended DVD set in a format that will be familiar to anyone who has bought the DVDs of Apatow's megahits. An entertaining though surprisingly vituperative commentary track is on Disc One with the cast and crew split between LA and New York. Disc Two has all the other extras including deleted scenes, a gag reel and the familiar line-o-rama clip (which shows quick alternative takes with different variations on lines improvised by the actors). There is also a thirteen-minute making-of featurette, video diaries, audition tapes, a short about the dancing opening title sequence, and video footage of early table readings going back to 2002 with different actors. The rest of the extras are targeted to true die-hard fans, such as videotape of a prank pulled on Hill related to his phobia of snakes and a half-hour series of clips called ""Cop Car Confessions"" with various actors in the back seat improvising with Rogen and Hader in the front.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I laughed through most of it.,"I seriously laughed through so much of it that I'm sure I missed key parts. Or let me phrase it like this, I was nearly thirty when I saw it and it made pop come out my nose. I walked in dead set on hating this movie, I actually begged my friends to go see something ""worthwhile"" instead. I left loving Superbad. It takes a bit for me to laugh out loud in a crowded theater, but Superbad did it for me. It brought me to tears, it suffocated me, and I think I might have torn a muscle or two in my side. Superbad came out of the blue and hit me full force, it rates with the classic comedies of the seventies and eighties. It is completely refreshing seeing a comedy like this today, I thought America lost its humor in '93.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Superbad: McLovin?! That's bad-ass!!,"When you take into account the amount of bad comedies that have been released lately, and near enough the same sort of style, IE: ""40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"", when Superbad was advertised, I didn't really think to give it a chance. Another brick in the wall...boy how wrong was I! I got a private screening, and decided to give it a chance. Besides, from what I had heard, it was basically a teen-movie that had been recognised to be better than American Pie. I did enjoy American Pie, its more of a cult thing though with teenagers, and it was released around my age-gap.""Superbad"" is far more crass and ""in-your-face"" than any other teen-movie. In fact, it simply grabs them by the face, and wipes its vileness all over them. Its absolutely genius.The film is basically about 3 teenagers; Seth (Hill), a crude large lad who talks more pussy, Evan (Cera), a quiet yet philosophical and intelligent lad who gets his point across and Fogell (Mintz-Plasse), the nerdy, yet really open geek, who dons a fake ID with a name ""McLovin"" and thinks he's the mutts nuts when things go his way. This trio are quite the unpopular kids at their high-school. They share all the trauma's, laughs and gags together, which involve talking about sex, girls, watching porn, getting drunk and partying hard (in their own way). It's their last day as high-schoolers, and these guys want to go out with a bang. The story looks at each character individually throughout the film, as they get invited to one of the hottest parties in town. Their mission: is to supply the booze.The casting is simple. Two main characters, with a good supporting cast, and the best supporting geek since sliced bread. Christopher Mintz-Plasse, take a bow. He portrays the ""high-school"" geek to absolute perfection. The guy that everybody love to hate - yet, you'll love the blighter so very much! His presence in the movie makes this film what it is. The way he talks, looks and actions he does throughout the film are golden. Jonah Hill takes the lead and gives a broad and crude performance, whilst Cera also dons a great performance taking and talking the more mature approach of the three. The relationship between these guys is magic. At times they hate each other, but you all know their still best friends. Its polite insults for them. The amount of swearing is probably a bit OTT, but hey, it is teenagers - name me teens that don't swear these days. Behind closed doors, this is what happens! I can honestly say with my hand held up, that this movie will probably be the funniest and biggest comedy this year, and the best teen movie since the original American Pie. Give it a chance.It's all about McLovin!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the funniest movies of the year,"Superbad is essentially about two things: the first is friendship, the second is alcohol. The movie is very well made on several levels because it explores both aspects while cleverly disguising them with laugh out loud humor. Superbad centers around Seth and Evan who need to get alcohol for a party so they can get the girls of their dreams. This basic plot line allows for some intensely hilarious situations, many of them centering around their friend Fogell or ""McLovin"" and his experience with two policemen.The film is very honest about itself and while the language and sexual explicitness is pumped up to a very high level, it depicts several aspects of high school life relatively well. The friendship between Seth and Evan feels real which keeps the film from becoming a cesspool of sex jokes and drugs. It also takes a very negative stance on alcohol, as apparent in the final scenes of the movie.The film does not contain a great deal of nudity, but the sexual dialog is stretched to a maximum. The dialog becomes almost gratuitous at parts, but usually offers some very funny moments. There is not a weak link in the cast, Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Seth Rogen and others do a great job as does director Greg Mattola on his first big project.Superbad is a pleasant mix of witty humor, gross out jokes, and surprising devotion to it's morals. It achieves something more than just a funny movie, following in the footsteps of Knocked Up and Forty Year Old Virgin, although this time with a very different feel. It if nothing else is incredibly funny and offers some great future talent both in front of and behind the camera.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Tame Dirty Comedy,"Boys behaving badly is the subject of this pretty funny adolescent comedy. Three uber-geeky high school seniors are invited to a party they otherwise would never get invited to because they promise to bring the booze. Their struggles to actually get to the party comprise most of the film's action. End of story.""Superbad"" is plenty naughty, but it's actually fairly tame for the genre. Even ""Porky's"" from more than twenty years ago felt more adult than this movie. The film's R rating comes almost entirely from its rough language, of which there is plenty, but there's little else to offend. This comedy is in the tradition of the recent spate of ""sensitive"" adult comedies like ""The 40-Year-Old-Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" in which guys learn to treat women with respect and maturity is something other than a four-letter word.I had two major complaints with ""Superbad"": one is that I can't stand the actor Jonah Hill, who unfortunately gets the bulk of the movie's screen time; the other is that I'm also tiring quickly of Seth Rogan, and his and Bill Hader's antics as the most irresponsible cops in the world provide the movie with its least funny moments, and serve only as a distraction from the much funnier and actually sort of sweet story about three teenagers' coming of age.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Most of it is already said, so I just have to agree...","This movie really felt like something groundbreaking, even thouhg there isn't anything unique in it. I think that what makes it so good is the balance between the outrageous comic situations (like the cops) and the parts that's relatable (teenage anxiety). And of course the perfect comic timing by all the actors.It also hits me how much they worked with details in this film. All the clothes and every set seems so well planned to fit in to the ""kinda 70-style, but still today"" atmosphere. I don't know if others agrees with that, it's just a feeling I get when I see it.I hope that Rogen&Co continues to make movies in the same leauge as this one, just like the frat pack done for the last half decade.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Great teen comedy,"I'm very difficult when it comes to comedies and this had me smiling, sometimes laughing, throughout. It's raunchy, immature, irreverent, gross but also funny and weirdly sincere and heartwarming. I think what helps a lot here is that the teenagers really look (and act?) like teenagers and not like twenty-somethings. I do think the teens (well mostly Seth) put way too much emphasis on sex but for him I think it was mostly a front as the teens do have some depth and ethics. The two cops are hilarious as some of the worst (or coolest?) cops in movie history. I also thought the guy in glasses playing McLovin was very good and believable. It's a movie I would certainly not mind seeing again with friends. I think it would be even better that way.Rating: 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Is OK.,"So ye, last night i was bored enough to choose this movie, also knowing i disliked Juno, and Knocked Up, 40 YO Virgin had it's moments so ye, why not give it a try, yet after the first 20 mins, i found myself going towards the same way as the previous movies mentioned.Superbad brings nothing new to cinema, the story is poor, although the scenes are somehow realistic as they explains well, how going out at night can be, and how dumb of people you can find outside.OK as for the movie, Jonah Hill from pretty much the start of the movie until the end, he uses the same expressions which doesn't take long to get old and boring, plus well he's funny, but not that funny.As for Michael Cera, i like his character being always polite and stuff, yet there's some moments less solid about this as well, first his character isn't even funny, and then at some parts he starts to become some sort of ""outlaw"" which motivates a little bit, but then goes back to what it was.For least but not last Christopher Mintz-Plasse, he brings a fresh air to a really boring part of the movie and his entrance in the movie is probably the only one that made me give the most honestly laugh all the entire movie. My hopes go up as am waiting to see if this guy can start being funny, yet i was wrong again....The whole move is cheap and poor, just like Knocked Up, let alone Juno... Ellen Page is more than that.Long story short, don't watch this movie alone, or you will either give up, or find it really bad, the movie is funny enough to entertain but hardly funny to make you laugh, or perhaps if you like basic verbal stuff and that you will explode laughing.Pick a good moment to watch it, with friends, on a party, if you are in a mood to laugh at anything that comes up, just if your not in a good mood, don't expect it to put you in that good mood....Superbad is more like Super poor.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Revenge of the nerds:  the next generation,"The starting point of this movie is a theme that's come up before--it's basic to Brian Robbins' silly and stupid but entertaining 'The Perfect Score' (2004): two best friends in high school are going to be separated because one got into a good college and the other didn't. As summer approaches a couple of the cool ""in"" girls ask them to supply the liquor for a party and they think they have one last chance to lose their virginity before they go away.The friends are the bushy-haired and overweight Seth (Jonah Hill) and the taller, lean, silky voiced Evan (Michael Cera). They talk dirty, but they don't know what they're talking about. Mottola's low keyed road comedy 'Daytrippers' appeared nine years ago and he's since been working in TV. He's now joined the team of Judd Apatow, who produced the very popular '40-Year-Old Virgin' and the current big summer hit 'Knocked Up.' 'Superbad' partly grows out of the late nineties TV series Judd Apatow produced, ""Freaks and Geeks,"" of which Seth Rogen, star of 'Knocked Up' (and a cast member here), was an important part, as writer as well as actor. 'Superbad' is the brainchild of Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who conceived it together when they were in their early teens in Vancouver.""Freaks and Geeks"" focused on a high school world where nothing was ever fair, where outcast status linked stoners and bad students and smart kids who weren't social -- as symbolized by the almost-romance between dumb dreamboat Daniel (James Franco) and the sensitive outcast and mathlete Lindsey (Linda Cardellini). ""Perfect"" guys and girls are who we'd like to identify with, and that's why big stars are so often gorgeous. But they aren't who we really are: ""perfect"" people aren't real.. In movies geeks and nerds usually aren't real either; they're stereotypes. But 'Superbad' gets away from that. Seth and Evan are a source of comedy, but they aren't unreal. They're just not aggressive like the campus macho men -- the types who're always beating up on undersized Sam (John Francis Daly), Lindsey's little brother in ""Freaks and Geeks,"" and who spit on Seth and warn him not to come to the cool girls' party.Seth and Evan do plan on going to the party anyway, helped by their nerdy pal Fogell (hilarious newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who's just acquired a fake ID that says he's a 25-year-old organ donor from Hawaii named simply McLovin (no first name). Fogell's going to buy alcohol. The babes (AKA ""ladies,"" using the Player name) are going to get sloshed and get laid by mistake, and as Seth says, ""We could be that mistake."" Fogell gets clobbered at the liquor store by a holdup man, then taken in tow by two very wayward and unserious cops. Seth and Evan get mixed up with a dodgy guy who takes them to a more dangerous party. The way to the cool girls' party is as convoluted as Harry and Kumar's trip to White Castle.'Superbad' isn't necessarily funnier than earlier teen or college comedies, the 'Harry and Kumars' and 'Dude Where's My Cars,' but it has a humanistic arc they lack. Like 'Knocked Up,' it leads off with a stream of foul language and winds up with sweetness and doing the right thing. It excels in celebrating the male friendships. It dares to speak of male love and depict it as something abandoned on the way to growing up, like Seth's drawings of penises--which he confesses to Ethan to having done obsessively as a little boy and which are shown in a phantasmagoric panorama in the middle and in the closing credits. The joke of these virgins locked in male-male bonding is that they can't deal with a babe when she throws herself at them. In a world of 40-year-old virgins it's no surprise Michael Cera was recruited from a TV series called ""Arrested Development."" Apatow says Seth Rogan really lives like the character he plays in 'Knocked Up.'In its blend of dirty talk and sweetness Apatow's and his posse's comedies are something different for which the current audience is more than ready, and his productions are beginning to multiply like prairie fires. It's great the way Apatow keeps gathering contributors and remaining faithful to them, and lets actors improvise freely. This is likely to wind up being not just a body of work, but a new school of American screen comedy, not unlike earlier productions of the kind but more fertile, almost a rival to the Eighties youth movies. And this success is deserved. There's a movement and energy in 'Virgin,' 'Knocked Up,' and 'Superbad' that shows the team know what they're doing. It's not all perfection, however. 'Knocked Up' seems like wishful thinking on several levels, with the smart girl accepting the nerd; and why is abortion completely skipped over as an option?. The physical business in 'Superbad' is crude, and not really that funny; the cop sequence is pointless and false--it too, wishful thinking..There is nothing sinister or revolutionary about the guys' language. It is a great exaggeration to think Seth & co. are so much more sophisticated or deviant in their sexual lore than earlier generations: society has just granted them license to use in public the bluntest language about what they, like their predecessors, still barely understand. But the language, post-Kevin Smith as it is, is a great source of relieved laughter. Something that was always there is now okay to speak about -- like two straight guys who love each other.NOTES: I got some of my information about Apatow & Co. from Damon Wise's piece ""Crowning around"" in 'The Guardian,' August 11, 2007. 'Superbad,' by the way, has a terrific opening title with silhouettes of Evan and Seth dancing.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Immature and crude but successfully funny,"'Superbad' is an immature, crude and at times offensive movie that, for obvious reasons, only appeals to a certain group of people. The movie consists of a basic, yet entertaining plot and a whole host of rude and inappropriate jokes. If it plays to your humour, 'Superbad' is a very funny movie.The characters in this film alone are hilarious. 'McLovin' provides plenty of laughs, as do the useless, childish cops. I do think the film is slightly longer than necessary, it does seem to drag towards the end and fails to justify the near 2 hour running length, but that is a minor criticism of what is a successfully funny comedy movie.If you like your comedies on the immature side and aren't easily offended by crude humour, 'Superbad' is definitely a film I would recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not bad,"Like Knocked Up, this was a lot better than expected. Yeah, the jokes are a bit misogynistic - but it's about two 17 year old boys. The trousers bit is a bit too far though, but so what? it's there to gross people out just like the Farrelly Brothers and American Pie using similar bodily functions to hilarious effect.Anyway, i digress. this film is very funny, touching, well written and well acted. Emily Stone (i think that's her name) is a stand-out. She could be great in years to come.What's clever about this film is the two strong male characters and a plot that unfolds mostly over just one day and night. At times it is slightly preposterous, but not Harold Kumar preposterous, it stays fairly solid throughout, not taking itself too seriously like good comedies never do, but not extremely so, as the Scary Movie franchise does.The relationship between the friends is being tested as college approaches, and so too is their ability to impress the ladies. It all makes for a good, enjoyable romp with a funky soundtrack (I loved the beginning credit sequence!) The higher brow crowd may not have taken to it, but who cares? They can't get everything, and let's face it, most of them are at least in their thirties, if not their forties or fifties. we'll leave u to your crossword grandad, u leave us to our youth culture.Final verdict: well i liked it, but i am a 23 year old male teenager. superbad it is not, but pretty good it is.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Only problem is, it would be their first and only true high school party.

McLovin' it,"""Superbad"" is a 2007 comedy directed by Greg Mottola starring Jonah Hill and Michael Cera. Now after the holidays and all the watches of both festive films and all the mammoth sized reviews about the Skywalker trilogy I decided to sit back and relax with a rewatch of one of my favourite comedies of all time. You know, every cinephile has certain films they don't simply cherish, some films convey a specific feeling of comfort and some just feel like a second home. This is the case for me with this classic high school comedy. Unlike other takes on the genre, Superbad has always been standing out with its hilariousness. Of course the humour is not everyone's taste and it is way too vulgar and perverse, but it's not only this, it's greatly combined with a dramatic conflict of two childhood friends suffering from separation anxiety. It's perfectly balanced between both extremely funny jokes and heart-wrenching drama. All of this comes to life by the genuine chemistry between the two leading boys, but let's not underappreciate the contribution of the hilarious chaos cop duo of Bill Harder and Seth Rogen and the legendary and infamous McLovin played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse. The plot is well worded for a teenage comedy and shamelessly, but realistically deals with what hormone controlled teenagers are confronted in their daily lives. It has an impressive story structure and the way it all comes together is superb. All in all, this modern classic authentically showcases the chaotic adventure of three high school friends dealing with their desires and even their emotions towards their upcoming separation from each other. It's nasty, perverse and extremely hilarious, but all the while shows it has heart and doesn't only stay on the surface. A super good gem I like to revisit at least once a year and highly recommend to everyone who wants to feel like 17 again. Anyways, I'm McLovin it.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

But don't be fooled into thinking this movie is for kids only, it comes with guaranteed enjoyment for any age!With so many broken stereotypes and dumbass characters, this film is a nonstop laugh machine.

Funniest teen movie since American Pie!,"Seth Rogen & Judd Apatow are fast becoming then new comedy superstars in Hollywood. They've given us THE 40-YEAR OLD VIRGIN AND KNOCKED UP, and now they are back with SUPERBAD. While not hitting the heights of the previous movies still has more laughs in it than a lot of movies out there, and is certainly the funniest teen movie since the American Pie trilogy.The plot sees Seth and Evan setting about trying to loose their virginity before heading off to separate colleges. Seth plans to get the girls drunk and then find one that will sleep with him. Evan gets caught up with this, although he has one girl in mind, Becca, a girl he has a crush on. Seth agrees to buy the drink for the party, and for this he uses another friend: Fogell. Fogell has got himself a fake ID, calling himself McLovin, and they plan to use this to go buy the alcohol.....I won't say anymore about the plot, but what follows is simply some of the funniest scenes this year. We get 2 of the most untrustworthy cops ever seen, more willing to break laws than enforce them. Evan and Seth get side-tracked into a different party, which leads to a hysterical sequence involving blood on his pants... Evan finds himself having to sing for some hard men, and Fogell becomes best pals with the cops!Rogen,who co-wrote the movie, and appears as one of the cops, knows that for a movie like this to work, for the gross-out moments and humour to work, you have to have characters that are both interesting and fun, and this movie is full of them. Even the female characters, who don't get as much screen time as the guys, are fully developed.But the real secret of this movie, is that it covers something you don't see often in movies, and that is the relationships between teen boys, who are best friends and growing-up and maybe apart for good.The young cast all do very well, but the 3 main leads, Jonah Hill (Seth), Michael Cera (Evan) and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Fogell) are all brilliant.Overall a truly funny movie about teen boys that will have you in stitches.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Superbad, No Introduction.","The critically acclaimed teen comedy that provided the breakthrough of stars Michael Cera, Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. While on paper it sounds pretty rudimentary of other films (take American Pie for example) it certainly isn't I can tell you that!It was just so enjoyable that not even the loud laughs can fulfill the satisfaction of gratitude I had watching. I wasn't to keen on it at first... but this is probably one of my biggest regrets of a film not seeing earlier, I don't know what was up with me not seeing it beforehand... do I not want to enjoy a great teen comedy??Fogell is something else, he has to be one of the most coolest characters ever put to a motion picture! Mclovin is just built different and oh the cops, viscerally adequate!! I also kind of like how the length is, it never feels too short, and too long it just hits a perfect runtime that feels hard to achieve nowadays.It's also not let down with cliché jokes as well, I think as a teen comedy it establishes itself as the acquired taste of a good time, and that's all we want with comedies, or any film regardless. Also after viewing, it leaves a great aftertaste that's so rewarding after any hard days work... like a Oreo's and milk if you get what I mean.Overall, it did it's job, I think we can all agree that the relevancy of other films like it have worn off in favour of a new generation of comedy, but I think we can all collectively agree with that Superbad will stay relevant for a while.Grade: A+Your thoughts?",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I liked it,"Actually this one stands out from the crowd. As a 40 year old I found my self laughing quite a bit and I must be honest and say I don't know what age group this was aimed at because the script seemed to be something that could appeal to anyone from the age of 12 to 60. Some of the jokes have a shock value but they are funny never the less. It has the geek will probably prevails element but there was no sign of the usual High School Addonis character who usually gets his come up-pence at the end of the movie which was refreshing.If this film was made in the UK it would be filled with Political correctness and over bearing in your face multiculturalism mixed with lame jokes aimed at 12 year olds by a director and scriptwriting team who would assume the audience are thick. Quite simply Britain couldn't make this kind of movie without completely messing it up.I liked all the characters from the main geeks, the cops and the would be girlfriends. No one was annoying.While the storyline is semi predictable the intelligent script makes it something I would certainly recommend if your in need of a laugh.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A great comedy movie,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Everything in this movie is just perfect. The characters are all funny and realistic.

Fogells side story with Seth Rogen and Bill Hader is the best part of this movie, its just so funny and heartwarming near the end.

Confused feelings but fun nevertheless....,"I had heard about this movie when it came out in the theatres, but knowing fully well that will never get a theatrical release here in India i kind of forgot about it.Then I came across the DVD and since it was a name i recognised i got it. I didn't expect much really other than standard Jude Appatow/Steve Carrel humour mixed with some standard teen comedy.What I've noticed with Jude is that he always evokes confused feelings, one side you will have pretty accurate description of how people look, feel and behave and at the same time you will have over the top and slapstick characters. The same movie will have thought provoking moments as well have moments that are so over the top, that they annoy.Well in this case its mixed with the teen movie formula, there's always the fat guy, the super nerd, the guy who's a semi-nerd but is actually going to become cool (most of whom are virgins), underage drinking, YOU KNOW THE DRILL.What Jude does is add a slight twist to the genre, which is sometime satirical, sometimes slapstick, sometimes just plain funny, and at others just plain irritating or boring.The acting is fine from the entire cast, especially good is Mintz as Mclovin, even the girls who are unfortunately not that hot have done a fine job (another example of accurate representation no 25-35 yr old hotties playing teens here).The background score was ordinary enough to be missed.Direction, cinematography etc don't really matter that much with such subject matter and was pretty standard.The humour was subtle sometimes and over the top on many others, the abusive language had novelty value in ""40 year old"" but has completely lost its charm here, the one liners are OK,ITS MUCH MORE ABOUT THE WHOLE DIALOGUE HERE THAN ONE LINERS.There are some really good scenes like the liquor store, and the entire Mclovin Cops saga, but there were many ordinary scenes like the gangs, and couple of the ending sequences.THE MOVIE DOES FEEL KIND OF SPACED OUT MUCH LIKE KEVIN SMITH'S MOVIES, In fact SOMETIMES I GET THE FEELING THAT I AM INDEED WATCHING A KEVIN SMITH FILM.Which bring us the MOST IMPORTANT PART EXPECTATIONS, I really didn't know that this movie was once in the ""Top 250"", if had watched this movie with those expectations needless to say i would have been very disappointed, i watched it expecting merely good hence i enjoyed this movie, I'm sure PEOPLE OTHER THAN FANS WILL REALLY BE DISAPPOINTED IF THEY WATCH WITH VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS.Fans and people who like such humour as shown by Steve Carell, Jude, Kevin Smith, will really like this movie others may enjoy it if they don't expect too much,THOSE THAT LIKE STANDARD AND SIMPLE COMIC FARE (like me) HAVE A VERY HIGH CHANCE OF BEING DISAPPOINTED (luckily i wasn't).Im not that sure girls will like this movie either.Watch with due considerations.-s some really annoying/gross/boring scenes, weak stereotypical end, NO REALLY BIG FUNNY SCENE.+/-s humour gets a bit spaced out sometimes,not exactly short in length.+s the entire Mclovin Cops sequence, good acting, SOME REALLY GOOD DIALOGUES.total 7/10 ( but thats only because i didn't expect much and it met my expectations, i wont lie that I'm tempted to be dishonest and put a low rating just to pull down the overall ratings, I CAN ENJOY THIS HUMOUR FOR A CHANGE ONCE IN A WHILE BUT GIVE ME SIMPLE HUMOUR ANYDAY).",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"If i were to pick a favorite comedy title, this wins the podium","SuperBad. I had seen and heard a lot about this title. Seeing the cult like following of the character ""Mclovin"" i decided to give it a go. I regret seeing this in 2010 (even though i wasn't old enough to see it when it came out). This is the best comedy title ever, No questions asked. The Characters are so likable and the story kept me in my seat the whole time. I was absorbed by the hilarity and the suspense it brought. Really, This is a movie you should really see and if you're not gonna end up loving it, you WILL like it nonetheless. I'm kinda put off by how some people (probably not even youngsters) call this horrible. Its a movie revolving around teen life (in a weird manner, yes, but IS a teenage based movie). Its target audiences are teens and young adults who love it. Why the negativity? This definitely does NOT deserve any less then 7 points.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Good, not as great as it could be.","Three teens, all awkward in their high school ways, try to ensure a wild finish for their senior year by procuring alcohol for a party. A night's worth of adventures ensues.It was hard for me to put a star value on this movie. As much as I liked it, I saw some flaws that needed to be addressed to propel this movie to an 8, or maybe a 9. First, there are pacing issues. Some of the scenes suffer because it's clear to the audience what will happen, and the scene takes too long to achieve the goal. This bit of trimming could make the movie feel a little more tightly bound. The second problem is an odd one. I'm not opposed to cursing at all, but the incredible quantity of it hurts the movie in a specific way - it hurts the sense of realism.Aside from these flaws, I can honestly say that this clearly beats Knocked Up, and is roughly as funny as 40-year-old Virgin, though with some of these drawbacks that lower my rating.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Super Bad is a Great Description,"Who hasn't seen this tired movie of seniors in high school trying to score booze and chicks. Wow it was SUPER BAD. Are you kidding me, this was terrible with little laughter, more of trying to figure out why it lasted so long, we kept checking the display button to see when our misery would be over, hoping there may be something of that had some comedic value. I guess if your in the 16 to 25 age group it may resonate to your high school years more then mine, but it all worked the same then as it does now. So three guys try to figure out how to get booze and hook up with chicks and go through the usual BS to score the booze,a very boorish story line that has been played over and over again and again.

Classic,"I think this might be the best teen comedy of all time. The quotable lines in this movie are endless. So many scenes will have you laughing out loud, especially in the first half. The replay value is unmatched.This movie comes closer to capturing what American high school culture is actually like than any other movie I've seen. It feels so authentic and doesn't go into the ""cliques"" bs that a lot of teen movies do. It understands that high school social class isn't black and white.The chemistry between Jonah Hill and Michael Cera is ridiculous, making for some of the funniest conversations I've ever heard. McLovin and the cops' side plot just adds an extra layer of chaos.And finally, I've seen some reviews on here complaining about the crude dialogue. Understand that this is how teens their age actually talk and behave. But beneath the rude humor this movie is actually very kind-hearted at its core. In the end, it's about maturity, friendship, and growing up. And it's handled well with a surprisingly touching ending.I can't think of anything negative to say. This movie is hilarious.

what the heck !!!!,"How did this get to be such a huge hit? The story and jokes are old and obvious. ALL of this has been done to death and this adds absolutely nothing new. I saw the ending coming a mile away. To make matters worse you don't like any of these kids. Cera is blank the entire movie. He basically says his lines with no expression--ever. Hill easily plays one of the most obnoxious characters ever. He's always insulting, always swearing (he uses the word ""f***"" nonstop) and is just grating. I kept wondering why Cera put up with him at all. Mintz-Plasse overdoes his nerdy character far too well. The movie isn't a total washout however. Bill Hader (looking like a very young Dan Aykroyd) and Seth Rogan are very funny as police officers Slater and Michaels. They manage to make even the tired lines they're given seem funny. Also I did smile a few times and the supporting cast was very attractive and appealing. So it's OK but you've seen this all before so many times.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Its a movie you can watch a few times and find new things to laugh at as well . This movie should most definitely be in everyones DVD collection as a keeper.

I wish I could get the time back from my life that I wasted watching this crap. Knocked up was so much better at least it had a good story.

Inspired Lunacy,"This wildly funny movie about two teenagers trying to get alcohol for a party starts rather slowly - I was on the fence about it for the first 20 minutes or so - but once it gets started it never stops, supplying a steady stream of insane situations and wacky comedy.What makes this particularly successful is that the two central boys, as well as the two girls they want to hook up with, seem real, at least to the extent anyone can seem real is such an absurdly plotted film. The vulnerability of the leads counterbalances the utter insanity of a nerd and two cops whose scenes are the funniest in the movie.In a movie that is basically just really silly, it's nice to see how they created just enough human emotion to keep the movie from feeling hollow but not enough to clog up the joke machine. It is just a wonderfully made movie that everyone should see.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
More true to life and funnier than a million American Pies.,"Superbad is the teen movie they are always trying to make when they come up with Meet the Spartans and Eurotrip, it is profane, gross at times, silly and very, very funny. It is also one of the most realistic films that deal with the teen years that I can remember, except for the joke-a-minute stuff and the fact that Jonah Hill gets the whip-smart likable chick And Michael Cera is knocking back headjobs And McLovin' scores the hot jailbait Come to think of it maybe this is NOTHING like growing up, but it still is funny.For some reason the credits and music are largely stuck in the 70s funk era, even though the film is set in the present day. It most definitely is good funk music though, and never overpowers the film or distracts you from what is happening.The film was written by Seth Rogen and his childhood buddy Evan when they were both kids in school, nerdy and unpopular. It deals with two school age kids named Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Micahel Cera) and how they desperately want to be popular and score with chicks.Gee where do these guys come up with their ideas?? The first few minutes of the film show with reasonable accuracy the everyday goings on of a high school kid and his buddy. Rather than picking colleges (already done) they are picking porn sites to subscribe to. Rather than discuss school stuff they are discussing after school stuff, most prominently parties that they would like to attend, but won't because they are dorks.Now there are many factions among the unpopular at every school, the smart kids, the computer nerds, the disgusting, the emo/Goths, the try-hards and the dorks.Dorks are usually not as physically mature as the cool, jock types, not as suave with the ladies, and not quite ready for mature conversation. They also aren't computer geeky, nor total social lepers, they just aren't quite ready yet.Seth and Evan are dorks. Their friend Fogel (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is also a dork, but exacerbates the situation by being a try-hard as well. His early attempts at hip-hop slang and mature banter create many uncomfortable chuckles. Fogel tells Seth and Evan that he is scoring a coveted fake ID that very day.As the school year is rapidly winding down Seth, Fogel and Evan basically seem to ignore the class schedule, and track each other down to chat, we learn that they have been friends since childhood, but their plan of attending the same college and rooming together has been waylaid as Seth didn't get the scores required. (This also rings true as I'd bet thousands that Jonah Hill has half the IQ of Michael Cera.) Early in proceedings a ""cool"" chick in class named Jules mentions to Seth that she is having a party that night while her parents are away, she invites Seth and Evan along, and Seth tries to talk himself up by saying that he will have access to a fake ID and can bring the booze.Much was made of ""McLovin"" in the marketing for Superbad, and with good reason, the scene in which Fogel unveils his new 25 year old Hawaiian organ-donor alias to the world is hilarious and creates much tension between the three leads, all of it leading to more jokes.Seth thinks supplying alcohol to the party will get him into Jules' pants, Evan thinks that buying some vodka for his muse Rebecca will gain him kudos, and who the hell knows what Fogel was thinking. I actually think his D&D obsessed character in Role Models is only a heartbeat away from McLovin anyway.While in the bottle-O trying to buy the booze the store is held up and Fogel is knocked down, once the inept cops (Seth Rogen & Bill Hader) show up they not only seem to swallow his story and new McLovin persona, but they offer to take him to the party direct.Seth and Evan assume the whole thing has gone horribly wrong and that Fogel is being taken to custody, and being teenage great buddies like they are they split.Now in separate cars going in separate directions, Fogel and Seth and Evan spend the rest of the night trying to get to the party, dealing with the many circumstances that seem to conspire against them ever making it. These events include mobile phone problems, an adult party (with very adult situations), and all in brawl, repeated police intervention and Seth being hit not once, but twice by cars in separate incidents.The film is always funny and often hilarious. It is irreverent, frequently gross and more true to life than a million American Pies or ""Insert generic teen film here"".Again to the point where all three dorks score to varying degrees on the first night! Final Rating – 8 / 10. It can't be a coincidence that every R Rated comedy worth its salt in the last 10 years had Judd Apatow's fingerprints on it.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

There were so many hilarious one-liners in the film that I will need to watch it again to see which ones I missed while I was laughing. This kind of unsentimental character piece needs a small tight focus so all of the nuances of the characters shine through. Michael Cera was great, and most should find his performance here just as entertaining as his take on George Michael.

One of the most funniest movies of the decade!,"The plot is simple, but what comes in it is incredibly hilarious! Plot: Evan (Michael Cera) and Seth (Jonah Hill) are best friends in their last year at high school. Both are going to college, sadly they're gonna to different ones. And both of them virgins. So in one day these funny and non popular teens want to get laid as fast as possible, joining in some crazy parties trying to have sex with the popular girls of their class. But to enter in this party they need to buy lots of alcohol and with the help of the rejected and nerdy Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and his fake ID they're gonna provide everything they can. But it's not that easy, and this three boys are gonna have a lot of trouble and we as audience are gonna laugh over and over again.What makes this movie so good? Anyone can relate to one of the characters easily. It is similar to movies like ""American Pie"" but it has some single aspects that really makes the difference. In ""American Pie"" movies sometimes there's some unfunny joke, some things that doesn't work all right, maybe a joke was too hard to laugh it and sometimes the characters are quite offensive, not funny and difficult to relate with it. One thing that is dumbfounding in ""American Pie"" is this: All of the characters are self confident, good looking boys and they're always on the run trying to get some hot chick. In the real world you really can look at Seann William Scott (Stifler) and thinks ""he could get a girl easily"". With that I point that this movie is not realistic at all. Now in ""Superbad"" you have a fat and funny boy with a incredibly taste for dirty jokes; a shy and cute boy with no skills for talking with girls without blushing; and a nerdy with a strange sense of confidence. This three musketeers on a almost impossible task. Well, the reality factor counts sometimes and in this one helped the movie be what it is: real funny!In ""Superbad"" 99,9% of the jokes has some original aspect and everything works. The dumb characters and the funny conversations are well written and not a single moment is wasted or not funny. And you can watch it over and over again even knowing everything what happens and still think that this is hilarious and enjoyable comedy.One thing that received the biggest amount of complains on the boards here was Michael Cera singing Guess Who's ""These Eyes"". Many thought that this scene was ridiculous and pointless and all that. Let me say this: people you are SO WRONG about that. It is one of the most funniest moments EVER. Since this is a teenager movie released in 2007 most of the teen audience (I think) really don't know the song and doesn't even know how difficult is to sing it. And one can think: Why he choose this song to sing? I sing better than he but he really was funny doing that, making the sounds of the keyboards and singing badly.Between the funniest and weirdest moments are: Fogell using his fake identity with the name of McLovin; Seth being hit by a car; Fogell/McLovin hanging with the irresponsible and funny cops (played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader); the strange party where Seth and Evan were taken by the guy who hit Seth; Evan talking on the phone with Becca, the girl he desires; the singing moment. I guess everything was funny and I couldn't stop laughing. All the actors were excellent in their parts notably the three boys and the cops. Here you have comedy professionals doing their best. One of the best teen comedies I ever seen along with the John Hughes's films. It really says a lot about teenagers and portrays them with some accuracy I must say.

Jonah Hill and Michael Cera star as Seth and Evan, two high school best friends who know that they won't get to see each other in the future after high school. Hill and Cera are believable in these roles and give us characters that we can all relate to. Along with them is a future movie icon who will always be known as McLovin. McLovin gets a fake ID made so that he can buy booze.

"If by ""Superbad"" you mean Superdirty and Superhilarious, then yes","Since Judd Apatow took the crown of hit comedies in 2005 with ""40-Year-Old Virgin,"" his films, and essentially comedy, has gotten dirtier and dirtier, or at least more not holding back the censors and settling with an R rating. If this is indeed true, then ""Superbad"" could very well be the apex. All the stuff guys think about or talk about only with their closest friends is the heart of the dialogue and it makes ""Superbad"" all the more super.Essentially a teen comedy, ""Superbad"" is about two best friends named Evan and Seth (named for the writers who based the film off their high school years: Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen of ""Knocked Up"") who are nearing the end of their senior year and are pretty much just foul- mouthed losers. Jonah Hill as Seth in particular.Hill, who made appearances in previous Apatow films, gets top billing here and much deserved. His lines are always the ones that your really dirty subconscious would say if you didn't beat it down constantly and that delivery along with his goofy appearance is his specialty. Michael Cera as Evan, however, is perhaps the half of the duo that makes it all work: his soft-spoken, ""under-your-breath"" humor balances out the loud, attention- sucking Hill--a quality not typical of comedic actors but something that suits Cera really well. He also makes the more meaningful, awkward high school years truth to the whole film work effectively to take ""Superbad"" somewhere beside the bathroom to get its mouth washed out with soap.The plot all takes place in one day when Seth gets invited to a party (a real party!) of a girl he has a mad crush on. To please her, he promises to bring the booze with his non-existent fake ID. Enter Fogle, the scrawny friend-out-of-pity with the quintessential nerd looks who has a fake ID that says ""McLovin'"" and it all goes crazy from there.What really makes this film win you over is how relatable the situational comedy is. Even if it all gets blown out of proportion, the way the characters handle it is so true to teenage life. It's easy to label ""Superbad"" as a teen comedy, but it goes beyond that--it clears the hurdles of the trash high school comedies that infested the early half of the decade and plus, it's rated R. This is a comedy truly for best buddies to recall their ridiculous high school days. Even if you didn't do the things Evan and Seth do in the film, your friendship was similar-- everyone's was/is. So no matter how outlandish and bizarre ""Superbad"" gets, it never warrants an eye roll because the characters are so strong.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A bit long,"Superbad is the archetypal teen movie: ultra cliché premise, stereotyped characters, and a scenario that fits on a subway ticket.It is pretty funny overall, though the gags and jokes are quite uneven qualitatively speaking, some being well thought-out and played out, some just not. The movie is also undeniably lengthy, some scenes or story lines are just too long, like the cop road trip with McLovin for example. A 10-15 minute cut could have really improved the dynamism.As for the actors, Jonah Hill obviously stood out even if Mintz-Plasse isn't far behind. Cera did what he usually does, no surprises whatsoever.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I'm Assuming the 'Bad' means 'Good',"You know these kinds of movies. The ones that grow on you. You can watch the entire thing through and mildly like it, but for hours, if not days, following, you find yourself laughing and/or enjoying the product you experienced.Superbad has now done that to me twice. Well, I've seen it now twice, and both times I kept finding it ""just okay"" or ""barely funny"" throughout, yet following and especially in discussion with a work buddy the next day, I found my laughing out loud at some of the lines and humorous (supposedly) irrelevant scenes.I also thought of how innocently they re-created high school, much like the John Hughes comedies of decades past. Aside from the goofy, but hilarious cops, everything pretty much played out as if this was based on true events. (Was it, Seth?)BFFs Seth (Hill) & Evan (Cera) venture through their last weeks of high school slacking, complaining and upset they can't continue their lifelong friendship into college as they're headed to different schools. While wooing their prospective mates, the inexperienced duos plan to hit up a party one night and they're set to purchase and bring the booze. Only they're underage.In comes Fogell (Mintz-Plasse in his introduction role thatwillseriouslydefine him from here on out) who got a fake ID with the one name (Cher, anyone?) McLovin on it and that he's Hawaiian. I'm guessing this was California, but most license plates (and police uniforms) state ""Clark County"" – which, of course, could be just about anywhere.At any rate, they go through hell & high water to get the tainted water and to the girls of their dreams while realizing they're losing more than they're gaining.If these were adults, it would be hard not to relish the many events, close calls and fun times they actually had. Meaning, they act like this will happen every day of their life outside of high school. It could, but it's 99% doubtful. Perhaps if these characters were real, they could, in fact, look back and cherish the absolute fun they had, if not just on this night.There's a ton of swearing and some sexuality towards the end – I did say this was realistic, so its crucial to the plot and actually separates this from those Hughes movies. It's also surprisenly touching, and I'm not referring to the bromantic ""drunk/love"" scene towards the closing. It's on the escalatorthe look Seth gives is so real and heartbreaking, it almost makes the whole movie, if you haven't already yet appreciated the humor – namely from (once again) the brilliant Michael Cera.It's not overloaded like the other Johan Hill/Seth Rogan movies with cameos, though there are a few. I couldn't believe my eyes when Clark Duke is spotted in the party with barely a line to his character. And speaking of Rogan (as Officer Michaels,) as funny he was as the rookie cop along with Officer Slater (Hader) as the drunk veteran, I thought they actually brought the movie down a slight notch. Sure, they were both hilarious – namely with the liquor store clerk, but they are the absolute only unrealistic part of the movie.That said, it's a real thinker. I've been told by more than one person – and as stated, this is my opinion as well, that this movie isn't great the first time. But it sure as heck grows on you the more you think about it. That's good writing.Side Note: after recently watching Easy A, a movie I fell in love with Emma Stone, it was great to watch her here. I sincerely hope she goes far in her career.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Amusing but Overlong,"Nerdy high-schoolers attempt to get in with the hip crowd by promising to supply booze for a party. The cops played by Hader and Rogen are funny, particularly in their first appearance as they investigate a robbery. Other comic highlights include the whole business with the fake ID and the somewhat disturbing segment about young Hill's obsession with the male organ. While it has many amusing moments, it goes on much too long for a comedy. The filmmakers attempt to make the scenes of male bonding touching, but they are rather contrived and lame. It's also hard to buy that a young woman like Stone will have anything to do with someone like Hill.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A highly entertaining coming of age comedy,"Those unfamiliar with this film may draw comparisons to the ""American Pie"" series but that would be inaccurate. This is a film that, despite the immature exterior, actually has some substance. Also, it's way funnier than those films and doesn't rely on cheap titillation for its appeal.The script is awash in expletives, like Kevin Smith with Tourette's. However, behind the pervasive crudeness there's an inventive story that will keep you entertained with all of the twists and turns that it throws at you. There's even an actual point to the story, neatly wrapped up in the closing scene. Not your usual sex comedy, to be sure.Jonah Hill and Michael Cera have excellent chemistry together and can also carry the story on their own when called upon. Also particularly memorable are the police officers played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader. There are no mis-steps in casting, which is a 'make it or break it' area for any comedy.I can't recall much that was noteworthy about Greg Mottola's direction but there were a few nice touches. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is a real high point. It's filled to the brim with vintage funk and rock, well-chosen throughout.But the most important thing about this film is that it's often hilarious. That a teen-oriented comedy would appeal so much to an adult like me is something that I didn't foresee. Chalk that up to the great performances and inventive script.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Good for a few laughs,"As high school movies go, this is actually pretty good. A simple, fun, and occasionally, but thankfully only occasionally, contrived story. The movie, in general, is a little too much in love with itself, and whoever edited it let certain scenes run too long. I could've especially done with a little less of the cop duo towards the end - Bill Hader and Seth Rogen over-improv many of their scenes.And that's pretty much that when it comes to the movie, however there's a bigger issue that rubs me.Since ""Apatow Inc."" now comes out with like 4 movies every year, each with basically the same cast and similar shtick, it's almost impossible to view ""Superbad"", or any of his other movies for that matter, independently of the whole lot. And that's kinda too bad 'cause due to the volume and basic sameness of these films you can by now pretty much tell from a mile away where the joke is gonna come from in almost every scene.I thought the Farrelly Brothers overdid it with their pace of ""same comedy every two years"", but this guy is relentless. He's in the year three of his big time Hollywood movie career, and already he's got like 12 movies. Take it easy, dude, the whole thing is getting kinda old.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The most random and fun movie I've seen in recent years.,"I don't know why Americans have that dream of the best party of their lives, because I have seen this theme in quite a few movies and especially in television series.In itself, it seems brilliant to me that this theme is put everywhere, from good quality movies to bad quality movies, but it is always present and honestly it is a theme that I find hilarious.Talking about Superbad is talking about a stage in the life of every young person worldwide, it is even talking about how many times we have a woman that we love and that we want to get to know in any way possible. It is a fact that this movie marked stages of our lives and that many times we wanted to be these 3 guys who had the best night of their lives.In conclusion Superbad is ""the movie"", it is that movie that you see again every day on television or that when it is announced on some channel you save the date to see it one more time, it has no script errors, it is well directed, it is super focused on what it needs and above all it has too much comedy. If you are looking for a movie with too many dark humor jokes or one that is guaranteed fun, you definitely have to see this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It's an average comedy flick....not sure about all the hype,"Well, I like Michael Cera because he played in another great movie I love called Juno. He's a phenomenal actor and he plays his parts very well, so I thought I would check this one out as well. I wasn't into this movie or it's humor that much. It had some good parts to it, but most of it was just so unreal (especially the police officers, are you kidding me? So unlawful!). Anyway, Michael Cera played his normal self, just like he did in Juno. But Juno was memorable compared to this one, which I probably won't remember. I'm not saying the movie wasn't watchable because it was and I watched it from beginning to end. It just wasn't my kind of enjoyable movie. What's not right for me though, may be exactly what's right for many others. That's why variety is good. So don't take my opinion here too seriously because it could be very irrelevant to many who go for this kind of flick. Just watch it and form your own judgment.

However there are also other moments which really engage and easily have some of the funniest jokes in this genre of comedy. The acting is also great, it's stupid, silly and teen like which is another highlight of this film. The movie is also good with anticipation however they sometimes extend it to the point of it becoming annoying. Overall a not so bad comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Not bad, not great","I am two generations removed from the high school seniors in this movie, but seeing the movie reminded me of the famous quote of Jean-Baptiste Karr, ""plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose"" (the more things change, the more they stay the same). The language now may be cruder and the sex more upfront, but the staples stay the same: friendship, sex, profanity, booze, awkwardness, social classes, porn, impending life changes, and so forth. All the modern innovations don't seem to have changed the equation much, if this movie is in fact representative.Even though the language is pretty raw, the thing I liked about it was how comfortable the kids were with it, like it was just the way they expressed themselves and there was nothing particularly wicked or immoral about it. All three of the main characters are quite likable.The movie is too long - the scenes with the policemen were the least effective and could have been pared down a lot.If my high school experience is any indication, the penis drawings are *way* too creative to have been drawn by any male high schooler. Whoever drew them really got into it - makes you wonder about such a person.If the math teacher is at all typical, then I can understand why many people give up on ever understanding the subject. His statement that, ""'i' is an imaginary number, it doesn't really exist"" is worthy of rolled eyes and despairing glances. Why did nobody ask why it was being discussed if it does not exist?I really liked the opening credits and they led me to expect more than I got which, I admit, is one of the better entries in the genre (which is not all that much praise). I just felt this movie does not live up its hype.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Amazingly funny and surprisingly honest.,"I like ""smart"" comedy, if you know what I mean. And, as a fan of that type of comedy, I know that it's an improper label. Most people think ""smart"" comedy is pretentious, dry, and over your head. Not so. The real ""smart"" comedy is the ability to send a decent message despite the texture (ie. sexuality; profanity, and basic vulgarity). By this criteria, anything from Clerks to The Life Aquatic to The 40-Year-Old Virgin could be considered smart. Superbad should be, as well.Jonah Hill and Michael Cera (who got his experience playing this awkward style of character on Arrested Development) exemplify the idea of a comedic duo in their roles as two Grade 12 students looking for booze and love. While their repertoire may not have been as extensive as David Spade's and Chris Farley when they pulled off Tommy Boy, Hill and Cera converse so well on screen that you forget you're watching actors do their paying work. Their conversations, especially in the early part of the film, seem as genuine as any obscene chat you've had with any buddy of yours in the hall. Christopher Mintz-Plasse, as the extraordinarily geeky yet paradoxically cool Fogell (a.k.a. McLovin) plays uncomfortable as well as any self-conscious high school nerd, notably in the good portion of the movie when he's joyriding with police officers Michaels and Slater (screenwriter Seth Rogen and rising SNL superstar Bill Hader), who steal the movie in regards to their out-of-code behaviour and personalities. Hader owns a particular scene in a bar where, increasingly intoxicated, he explains to the simultaneously scared and wondrous Fogell why one should never pick up women in bars. Their forceful comments during the climactic party-crashing are enough to earn their way into IMDb quote books for good.As noted in the opening paragraph, though, Superbad has a message. Evan's encounter with his drunken crush at the final party provides a firm moral dilemma not usually encountered in your average teen sex comedy, and Seth's drunkenly confessed insecurities hit home for more than a few of us. More than anything else, the film's epilogue reinforces the knowledge every high schooler should realise: not all friendships can last beyond graduation. Hard to believe this was written by students all the way back in Grade 9.See it, and stay for the first half of the credits. I will not reveal why.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

One of the worst movie I ever saw.,"I had a very unpleasant experience watching Superbad. Not only is it full of boring, immature characters (besides Emma Stone, who is awesome) but the ''comedy'' it's supposed to be is not even a tiny bit funny. Using the P word in an abusive way, two awkward guys try to have sex with girls who are way out of their league. Unfortunately, this movie is not the only one in this moronic kind. This kind of humour is probably just for one specific target group, but I'm wondering which one! Inapropriate can be funny, but not in that case. Unfortunately, Michael Cera will always be doing the same awkward guy, which was funny in Juno but now it's just getting old. I understand that it's supposed to be idiotic, but it didn't make me laugh once. But do we really have to suffer now just to watch a movie? It's a tiny bit insulting. I tried twice to watch this movie and it just wasn't for me, I guess.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Perhaps the most crude, vulgar, profane movie of all time... and one of the funniest, too.","We've all been there  ""there"" being high school  and we've all encountered that certain awkwardness when dealing with such things as partying and, well, girls. 'Superbad' is a movie about that uncomfortable space  the space between cool and un-cool, fun and sex, and, essentially, friendship and all that comes after. The team that brought us 2005's '40-Year-Old Virgin' and 'Knocked Up' back in June has again raised the bar for future R-rated comedies with this raunchy teen sex romp that immerses itself in crudity and profanity, so much even, it surpasses the level of vulgarity and reaches an impossible gauche nirvana. The film's dialogue is shocking, shameful, outrageous and offensive, and comes at an alarming rate, never-before seen and you know what? It's hilarious! 'Superbad,' written by 'Knocked Up''s own Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who executive-produced 'KU,' makes 'Fargo' seem like a daycare nap time movie and turns Borat into a boy scout, with its aggressive, foul-mouthed approach. Yet despite its obnoxious script, it somehow manages to win over its audience with its genuine portrayal of high school life and the sincerity of its two main characters, Seth and Evan.Jonah Hill plays Seth, Evan's dirty-minded best friend who used to have a condition, ""shared by 8% of all kids"" we're told, which caused him to draw unlimited pictures of the male sex organ. Evan, played by 'Arrested Development''s Michael Cera, is the straight-faced good-hearted guy whose sarcasm mediates Seth's smuttiness. Seth and Evan are socially inept high school seniors with the looming days of college initiating their separation. All Seth wants to do is hook up with a girl before he goes to college, whereas Evan has his eyes, and hopes, set on a relationship with his longtime crush. When the two boys are invited to the biggest party of the year, at which Evan's crush and Seth's target will be ""wasted,"" their world takes a turn for the lucky. That is until, in their mindless attempt to be ""cool,"" they're stuck with the responsibility of providing the party with its alcohol. That presents a huge problem. Insert: McLovin. The ""25-year-old Hawaiian organ donor,"" known to his classmates as Fogell (played by riotous newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse), offers to do his only two friends, Seth and Evan, the favor of their life by buying the alcohol with his brand-new false ID.The movie is sharply filmed, for a comedy or otherwise, and its unadulterated editing makes its subject matter feel fresh and authentic. Much like 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin' and 'Knocked Up,' 'Superbad' is laden with pop culture references and rings the bell of high school renditions in the vein of Linklater's 'Dazed and Confused.' The insight of producer Judd Apatow, director Greg Mottola's appetite for a retro-80's feel, Jonah Hill's potty-mouth, Michael Cera's deadpan sarcasm, and, well, McLovin, make 'Superbad' the funniest movie of the year and an instant classic for the coming ages. For the 18 to mid-thirties male demographic, there's perhaps no funnier, more vulgar movie ever. However, those who don't fit that demographic might want to take their earmuffs, or maybe even skip this one altogether.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not one you want to see with your parents,"First off, let me say that if you don't like crude humor (see Old School, Wedding Crashers, etc.), you shouldn't bother seeing this movie. Don't complain when you don't like it, because you're not part of the targeted audience.Now if you are in your late teens or 20s, there is no way you can't like this movie. Non-stop laughter is the best way to describe the movie. There is literally no moment during the movie where you aren't laughing or wiping the tears away from your eyes because you just got done laughing. It is just that funny. It's hard to catch all the jokes because the audience is probably still laughing from the last joke.What makes this movie so great is that it is an accurate description of what a lot of guys go through during their HS years. And why shouldn't it be, considering the writing of the story began when the writers were teenagers.If there is a movie than can fit more laughs in 110 minutes, I have yet to see it.

This movie was smart and freaking funny at the same time.

"another triumph from the ""Knocked Up"" team","Filmmakers Judd Apatow, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg make lowbrow comedies for highbrow audiences. With films like ""The 40-Year Old Virgin,"" ""Knocked Up,"" and their current gem, ""Superbad"" (directed by Greg Mottola), they have begun, in their own quiet way, to re-write the rules of the modern sex comedy, making films that, despite their R-rated blueness, are just a tad more insightful, a little more nuanced, and a trifle more literate than most films in that genre.The characters in their movies may seem at first blush to be mere photocopies of the nerds and losers familiar to us from all those post-""Animal House,"" pandering-to-youth comedy hits of the late 1970's and 1980's. Yet, there is something rather different about these individuals, a difference that it is not always all that easy to put one's finger on. They seem somehow more reflective and self-aware than their earlier counterparts, more able to step out of their skins and see themselves for who and what they are. It's almost as if these characters have had the added advantage of seeing themselves reflected in all those earlier movies (one imagines they've spent a great deal of their childhood reveling in ""Revenge of the Nerds"") and of extracting important lessons from those films to help them chart their course through life.The storyline, in and of itself, is hardly original. The screenplay by Rogen and Goldberg chronicles the misadventures of three teenage super geeks determined to go to any lengths or suffer any humiliation to be part of the ""in"" crowd at school. With only a few days left before graduation, Seth, Evan, and super-nerd Fogell - an outcast even the outcasts can feel comfortable ostracizing - decide that the time has come to take some drastic action if they hope to have any chance of losing their virginity before high school ends. Thus, Seth cooks up a scheme to smuggle booze into a graduation party being thrown by one of the hottest girls on campus. It is the expected setbacks they encounter as they go about the business of achieving ""coolness"" that provide the comic energy for the tale.As they did in ""Knocked Up,"" the writers capture the way people in the real world actually speak. The dialogue may be crude and vulgar, but it is also sharply observant and wickedly funny as the characters lament the unfairness of life and reveal deep-seated concerns and feelings about themselves and each other. What's nice is that the characters in this film not only sound like people we might encounter in everyday life but LOOK like them as well. Even the ""beautiful"" people in this film aren't drop-dead gorgeous, just believably well put-together and attractive.Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and Christopher Mintz-Plasse are so authentic and convincing in the roles of Seth, Eric and Fogell, respectively, that they have us securely in their corner from the very first moment they appear on screen. Rogen and Bill Hader (""SNL"") also have a good time playing goofy cops, although their characters aren't as finely drawn or interesting as the three main characters, and the scenes with them do tend to drag a bit.It is crucial to point out that, amidst all the blush-inducing, foul-mouthed hilarity, there's an incredible underlying sweetness to ""Superbad,"" particularly in the final two scenes of the movie.Together, this team of talented filmmakers is making it fun to go to the movies again.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
My Manpinion,"Superbad 7.5 / 10 (Comedy) Saw this today. It's not a bad comedy. Think American Pie minus the nudity but add 500% more vulgar jokes and language. I will proudly say I was laughing a lot in this film, and the only real disappointment I had was the ending, and the fact that 40% of the best jokes can be found in the R rated trailer. Still I felt it was money well spent, if your only goal is to laugh and your not easily offended by language.There are two police officers in this movie who kind of stole the show from the kids, but thats OK, they were hilarious and very over the top.There is also a lot of gay innuendo between the two best friends. They seem to like each other better than the girls who want to bang them.For the category of comedy I would easily rate this 7.5 out of 10. based entirely on how much laughing I actually did.manpinions.comFINIS",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An Overall Fun and Realistic Experience,"Okay, as a Senior entering his final year of high school I can honestly say that you can't consider the language gratuitous or unnecessary. This is how high schoolers talk and act. Out of all the teenage sex comedies out there, this has to be the most realistic one out there.The movie also portrays the girls not as just sex symbols but objects of affection that have some brains and personality to their beauty.Having seen, owning, and loving Dazed and Confused I will say that Superbad is our generations version of Dazed and Confused.I highly recommend this to high school and college students alike.

Superbad SuperSUCKS!,"I'm not kidding, this one goes on my Top 5 Worst Movies EVER Made, and takes the #2 slot. The main character is just a fat, ugly, curly haired jackass that spends all of his time talking about how he wants to get laid...and in real life, no amount of alcohol in the world could help him out. It's a stupid movie that pretty much has guys treating women like a bunch of ""sex-holes"" and nothing else. I'm no feminist or prude, but this was awful. It had no point and no funniness. I hated it to the point where not even Seth Rogen could redeem it, and he's usually funny as hell. This is another one I couldn't finish, and there are very few out there that I can't sit through, so it had to have been real bad.

Superbad is the funniest film of the year!,"Rated R for pervasive crude and sexual content, strong language, drinking, some drug use and a fantasy/comic violent image - all involving teensIm a teenage boy(15 years old) so I usually enjoy teenage sex comedies.I don't just like the new ones, the old ones are great as well and Fast Times At Ridgemont High is up there on my favorite teen comedy list.The trailers for this film were funny and I knew from the start I would enjoy it, I mean I really liked The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, but I thought it would be your average teen comedy.Was I wrong! Superbad is one of the funniest and greatest teen comedies of all time.There were times when my sides were hurting because I was laughing so hard, and that rarely happens.The film takes place in 1998.Evan and Seth are two lifelong friends who are about to be separated when they go to different colleges.Evan is calm and quiet while Seth is profane and obsessed with sex.The two never go to high school parties but they plan on it when they get invited to the last one before graduation by the girls that they are in love with.They get their friend Fogell who has a fake ID to buy them alcohol for the party,though his ID has a weird name on it(McLovin) he gets the booze but then the store he goes to gets robbed and these two cops come.Seth and Evan think Fogell got busted and go look for their own booze but end up at another party with some crazy people.Meanwhile Fogell and the cops go wild on a road trip.The whole movie shows the misadventures of the three and their attempt to get alcohol for the party.The trailer does not even come close to the hilarity of this film.If you like teen comedies, go watch Superbad now!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Superbad is Super Great,"I don't often comment on movies, but on this one I had to. This was by far the best movie of 2007 in my eyes. I didn't think it could get any funnier than Knocked Up, but I was wrong. I saw it two times in the theater and laughed the entire way through it both times. The great raunchy humor mixed with an excellent plot makes for one great movie.The characters of this movie were cast perfectly. Seth Rogen, of course, was genius as Officer Micheals. I thought the break-out roles by Micheal Cera and the beautiful Emma Stone were excellent.If you want to actually enjoy a great movie, go see this one. I promise it will be well worth the 10 dollars.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I AM McLovin this movie,The mix of surreal and real is the key to what makes this movie great. You take your average teen flick about the geeks of a high school during last days of their senior year trying to get laid before they head off to college. Yes a tried and true formula. It probably gets a few laughs. But this movie adds the weird and surreal twists into plot that makes the jokes a 100 times funnier. I couldn't guess where the movie was going and I didn't see the jokes coming. I laughed out load (LOL for real) about 30 times. The real strength of the movie is the three main characters. They all have the best dialog and the actors deliver it better than I bet the writers could have hoped for. This movie is now in my top five of comedies. 10/10. I'm McLovin it.,10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Instant classic,"Seth Rogen and friends have made some good movies but I think they really outdid themselves with this one. I don't see them ever making a movie this funny and this enjoyable again. Maybe close, but not like this one. I feel like it really speaks for our generation way better than movies of the 90s did. The characters are lovable and we can easily relate to them. They actually seem like kids instead of adults playing kids. We see them learn about themselves and grow on screen. They also all have their own humor. I think Jonah Hill is very genuine in this movie and I can't get enough of him. Michael Cera is just so awkward you can't help but both laugh and cringe as you watch him, it's great. There are some other hilarious performances. Actually, just about everyone who we see on the screen adds to the essence of this movie. One of the best teen movies/comedies ever. I suggest that everyone give it a chance and enjoy it as much as me and my friends do.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Worst movie I ever saw.,"I can enjoy a vulgar movie. I can enjoy an immature movie. I can enjoy a movie full of profanity. The bottom line is that this movie is downright terrible. TERRIBLE!! The cinematography and sound are good, but other than that, I can't find anything good to say about this movie. It wasn't funny at all. The actors delivered completely lackluster performances. This story had so much potential for laughs and it was squandered.I honestly believe that the reviews and ratings of this movie have to be tampered with because there is no way this movie could score that high otherwise. It is simply the worst movie ever. With great difficulty I slogged through this movie because it was so highly rated that I was expecting something amazing to happen in the end. I was sorrowfully disappointed. I am thankful I didn't pay to see this thing or I would be angry.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
superbad was superbly amazing.,"One of the few movies in general that I not only had to see the weekend it came out in theatres, but also had to buy on DVD and watch numerous times over and over again, many times with friends.It's truly a comedic masterpiece, but not in the stupid, mindless way most films about teenagers are. It's funny because people can really relate to the characters, either seeing themselves or their friends in them. The acting in it is amazing, it introduced a whole new generation of quality comic actors, most notably Michael Cera, whose role as Evan is sweet, charming, and endearingly awkward. However, the audience favorite--admittedly, mine too--was Christopher Mintz-Plasse as McLovin, the ubergeek who infiltrates the adult world by essentially being in the right place at the wrong time. The comedic timing, however, is immaculate. Superbad is worth watching...over, and over, and over again. I also recommend getting the extended version DVD, because the extended features are almost as hilarious as the movie itself.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Superbad was Supergood...Supergreat in fact.,"Nothing is more entertaining for me in a movie when a few dorks get together to try and get there first piece of female ass before entering manhood. Superbad had me in stitches throughout, it has everything a good teen comedy needs, 'likeable characters, funny make out scenes, & adults who act just as unruly as the kids'.To me, for a movie to be good i have to be able to remember a quote from it, here's one that cracked me up:""You know when you hear girls say 'Ah man, I was so sh!t-faced last night, I shouldn't have f***** that guy?' We could be that mistake!Priceless! It just doesn't get any better than that, and there are so many more as well.Great movie, will watch again.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Brilliant Comedy,"WOW, this movie was so funny and well acted. It was so well written and honestly quite entertaining. I read many great comments about this movie and didn't get the time to watch it when it first came out, so one day I was just bored and decided to watch it on my CPU..it was great! I think that 3/4 of the people here who write negative comments on this movie either (A) have no sense of humor and then i completely understand, or (B) just don't like the actors in this movie. There are so many funny moments/scenes in this movie, and the characters are developed well and the jokes are target-on. It was funny because all of the F-bombs Seth (Johna Hill) was spilling out, same with Evans and Fogell aka McLoving. McLoving sold this sh*t hard, he was hilarious and big-ups to the officer (Seth Rogen)This movie overall honestly explained a very typical time in high school whether it be your senior year or sophomore year. It is all about proving yourself to other in an attempt to either get laid or just fit in. Hands down one of the funniest movies of that year. As a rewatch 07/20/18' and multiple years later, Superbad remains a great and hilarious time watching comedy. Filled with many subtle jokes and clever gags that did not noticed on initial watch, the film has seemed to age well.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Respectfully, This Film Sucked","This was not a good film. Period. Honestly, on my personal rating scale, I would have probably given it about a 3/10. It had its moments here and there. Kind of. However, the hype surrounding this movie and all of the excitement about its poorly written, downright dumb jokes were outrageous. I'm tired of hearing people talk about Superbad. I'm tired of hearing its name compared to good movies. And most of all, I'm tired of people saying it was good because they heard it was. For all you uneducated folks who insist on hyping up this film, that's called ""jumping on the bandwagon."" Whatever guy of high authority used the words ""good"" and ""Superbad"" in the same sentence deserves to be locked in a room for a year with this so called ""comedian"" Jonah Hill. This movie was the epitome of the word ""stupid"" in all of its essence. From start to finish I was waiting. Waiting for something that never came: A good joke. Anything that would have let me leave the theater feeling the least bit satisfied. The filmmakers attempted to make a film that we could relate to. ""We"" being teenagers. Unless you are a dumb brick, you can't relate to this film. Quite simply, they failed in that sense. I mean, are we really this dumb? I beg you, if you wasted your money on a DVD of this film, watch it again, but this time keep this in your mind: This is how adults view us. This is how the world views us. Yes they probably made a bundle off this low budget piece of garbage. But I remind them, I'm still waiting for something that makes me laugh. So I vote they make a new film, maybe start fresh, throw in some guys who are actually funny. How bout NOT Jonah Hill...and let's just steer clear of Seth Rogen, because he isn't funny. ""Knocked Up,"" another mockery of modern film making, was also crap. It's not like I don't have a sense of humor. I love comedies. Want to see a good comedy? Go watch Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Go see any film by Wes Anderson. Hell, I like the dumb ones too. I highly recommend just about anything with Jim Carrey or Steve Carrel. THOSE are comedians. So please try to avoid watching this if you haven't already been sucked in by all of the hype. Because (I'm sure that I'm not the first person to say this) ""Superbad"" was simply super bad.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One I think that people will be watching over and over again,"Hilarious and smart teen comedy, without a doubt one of the funniest of the year. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill play two high school seniors who are best friends. When invited to a cool chick's party, they try to get their über-geeky friend, played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, to use his fake ID (on which he is now infamously renamed ""McLovin"") to get them some alcohol. From there, everything goes awry. It's really a laugh-a-minute movie. The previews and commercials ruined a few of the best jokes, but there is no shortage of laughs anywhere in the movie. It also manages to be fairly touching, without devolving into schmaltz (a problem that the film's producer Judd Apatow has yet to solve in his own films). The awkward dialogue is wonderfully convincing, and completely recalled high school for me. Very enjoyable, and one that I hope to enjoy very often in the future.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I describe it as the 'Animal House' of my generation. Filled with classic but extremely raunchy one-liners and a hysterical penis drawing sequence, 'Superbad' is practically a non-stop laugh riot from start to finish. Jonah Hill, whose been kinda held back a little in films like 'Knocked-Up' and 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', is absolutely hilarious in a role that kinda reminded me of myself in some ways. Michael Cera, whom you probably know from the sexually frustrated teenager in love with his cousin in 'Arrested Development', is equally as good and does a nice job of displaying his acting talents. The rest of the cast is all great including Seth Rogen, Bill Hader, Emma Stone and of course the actor who played McLovin who was a constant scene-stealer. The only down-side to Superbad is that there is some parts where it lags a bit, and the ending is a bit awkward. Besides that, 'Superbad' is extraordinarily entertaining and I recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic teen comedy. Grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Just fantastic....Hysterically funny,"I am not a big fan of teen comedies; most of them are just plain stupid. I thought American Pie and There's Something About Mary were pretty bad. I had heard the great reviews on Superbad and just had to see this. Both my wife and I laughed throughout, but I was almost on the floor.Sure, some of the situations are unbelievable, but you could say that about a lot of classic comedy. Sure, there are some dead spots (the whole subplot with the cops gets a bit strained at times). But I can't remember laughing almost continuously, loud and hard in such a long time. I know I missed a lot of throwaway lines, and look forward to seeing this again when it comes out on DVD.By the way, I am 53, and while I'm not a grandparent, I could be.

The jokes were non existent, unless you find constant meaningless innuendos about sex funny. I can't imagine anyone outside the age of high school finding this worthwhile to watch. Besides using the f-word all the time is not interesting or original.

This entertaining comedy is more of a coming of age film than the ultimate party movie.,"Seth (Johan Hill) and Even (Michael Cera) are best friends for years now but since they are leaving for college after their high school is done. Which their plans has changed as well, since they are not going in the same college. They would like to have one big party and hopefully trying to get laid with the girls, they have crushes on. When Seth's dream-girl Jules (Emma Stone) asks Seth if he could buy booze for her party. Even hopes to buy his dream-girl Becca (Martha MacIssac), her favorite bottle of alcohol. Since Seth's and Even's goofy buddy Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is getting a fake I.D., if it's convincing enough for his new I.D. But then these three friends turns completely different, when they supposedly fool-proof plans goes bad. Since Fogell's fake I.D., which he calls himself only as McLovin!. Seth and Even thinks that Fogell got arrested by two not-so-bright cops (Bill Hader and Seth Rogen), which these cops still act like teenagers. Now Seth and Even are trying to find ways to find booze before they could go to that ""big"" party for the end of their High School years. But there's pressure of these two friends, since they might lose their friendship before they go to separate ways in different college.Directed by Greg Mottola (The Daytrippers) made an amusing comedy of age comedy that has some big laughs and this actually plays this film is more real to life than the typical teen comedies, that you would normally see. Hill and Cera have good chemistry together, they also have good performances as well. Which their performances gives the movie it's heart. Newcomer Mintz-Plesse steals the show, he brings some of the picture's best laughs. He is extremely likable out-through the film. This comedy was one of the biggest hits in the summer of 2007 and the reviews were surprisingly good for this kind of film. ""Superbad"" could have been a really bad movie if they didn't have the right director for the coming of age comedy. But Mottola's does an fine job with his second film, which he cares enough for the characters in the movie by making them as real as possible with memorable roles.The Single Disc DVD Version of the ""Unrated"" Cut is actually four minutes longer than the R-Rated Theatrical Cut. DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an amusing commentary track by the cast & crew members of the picture, Deleted/Extended Scenes, Outtakes and more. This is probably one of the best teens movies in a long time and it is the kind of film that adults will enjoy as well. ""Superbad"" has its flaws here and there, especially during the middle half. Where it's drags a bit and there's some cheap laughs along the way. But it's doesn't hurt, it was certainly very different than what i have expected to be. But it's certainly a very good movie, it is the kind of film. When teenagers will have a special place in their hearts for this movie like ""The Breakfest Club"" for those who really loved it. Which i still watch, even though i am much older now and still loving it. ""Superbad"" will be contemporary classic for the teenagers and young adults. Don't miss it. Written by Seth Rogan (Drillbit Taylor, Pineapple Express) and Even Goldberg. Which Rogan and Goldberg came up with the premise of this movie, since they were 13 years old!.

Very very funny,"I took my teenage son to a preview; I squirmed with embarrassment for the first few minutes, but it turned out to be the funniest film either of us had seen since Borat. The plot is straightforward; three nerdy sex-obsessed schoolboys are on a mission to buy alcohol for a party. In that respect it's a dumb teen comedy like American Piebut it's much better, and in a peculiar way, more moral. Warning: lots of swearing, lots of kn*b gags, and some very crude dialogue, none of which I could repeat here. The two lead characters (Jonah Hill and Michael Cera) are great. So are Bill Hader and Seth Rogen  star of Knocked Up and the film's co-writer  who play immature, out-of-control policemen. Christopher Mintz-Plasse, as the lead characters' geeky sidekick McLovin', is best of the lot.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A Teen Sex Comedy, But Honest. We Call That A Paradox.","Not only has the film been advertised incessantly with scenes of Jonah Hill in 1970s outfits and music from the '70s and '80s, but the film opens with a very funky '70s-style opening sequence with funk music. Then, the story begins, and the first thing that happens is a cell phone conversation, involving very up-to-date cell phones. At this point, you are taken quite aback. As the story progresses, you realize the acutely contemporary condition of teenage partying and sex among teens. What time period does Superbad think it's in?! The '70s motif confuses me to this second. It's something that can easily sever your tractor beam to the movie as the audience. However, this acutely contemporary look at the sphere of teenage sex and parties that I speak of is quite stunningly honest and poignant.The greatest charm of Superbad is how it laughs with us, as everyone knows that sex is not at all the way one thinks it's going to be like, yet our main characters, played by very brazen and loud Jonah Hill, nervous straight man Michael Cera, and iconic geek Christopher Mintz- Plasse most certainly do not know that. To put it very simply, it's the long-hoped-for antithesis to the American Pie films, which treat not losing your virginity before high school is over like the end of the world that nobody should be made to think that it is. They're tailored for an even younger audience than Superbad is, heroicizing wham-bam-thank-you- ma'am guys and girls that are too cool to give certain people the time of day, and romanticizing that naive yearning for sex when we're in high school. Superbad is quite hilarious and comfortable because of its honesty with the subject, not any sort of shallow perpetuation of fitting-in mentalities in pre-teens turning into teens.The boldest highlight of the movie, one of the funniest and most enjoyable things I've seen in a movie lately, is the plot strand involving Seth Rogen and Bill Hader as two cops who have no inhibitions with rebelliously fudging the law for their own good time and bringing the character well known by even those have yet to see the film as McLovin, played with a stunning dose of gawkiness by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, along for the rest of their shift, letting him do things like fire a gun and have beers with them, all leading to the message the film sends pertaining to people even older than those who will be seeing this movie and understanding the virginal naiveté of the characters. The film just hits a lot of notes that most teen movies of now don't bother to send, and in fact oppose.The script, written with great wit and both an ear and a memory bank for teenage dialect and mindset by Seth Rogen himself and Evan Goldberg, weaves the film along very gracefully throughout, clocking a day in the life, up until the tacked-on ending, which may just be a product of the intimidating demands of studios and audiences that feel deserted or confused without a film that ends like nearly all the rest of the teen movie bunch. Don't forget what it was like to be a teenager, before we wanted to admit that maintaing strong friendships is more important than partying and sex.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

This movie is smart, funny, well casted and not your average ""American Pie"". I'm nearly 40 so I don't usually go for this type of movie but all the hype and some of the actors involved, peaked my interest.

This movie has one of the funniest scenes in movie history dating back further then the Marx Brothers.This upbeat new age teen comedy really speaks to what it was like growing up as a teen, with great play on words which most find offensive but to me, it means someone has no sense of humor and takes life to seriously. This movie is the pinnacle of the summer movies of 2007, and by far takes the cake. IIf this movie doesn't make you feel better or your day feel any better you have robbed yourself with a closed minded view of the world and you were obviously depraved of comedy as a child.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What a great film,"As a growing fan of Seth Rogan and having hugely enjoyed Judd Apatow's productions to-date, it was with some trepidation that I went to see Superbad. I was concerned because of the obvious parallels to the likes of American and various 'right-of-passage' films out there.I was far from disappointed. This film is wicked and manages to tap into the bizarre mix of teen confusion and angst (which inevitably only becomes hilarious when we are old enough to look back at it!) that equals outrageous and unbelievable moments of comedy. I remember watching Napoleon Dynamite and thinking that anyone who can't sympathise with this character either never went to school or was simply the arsehole who never knew (and never will know) better. I like American Pie(s), but NapD had the feel of reality. Superbad takes it to a whole new level; I can't speak for the girls out there, but I never knew a boy who wasn't even moderately obsessed with porn and the prospect of getting laid. The point here isn't my own scary nostalgic look back at my teens, but rather the chance to look back once again and think, hell I am so glad that is all done with.Seth and Evan really are you and me... at last. Well done Seth (Rogen) and Evan (Goldberg). I don't think I will promote this film as a guide to teens - hell I am a parent myself now, but it is a ray of hope to those of us who have been there and done that - we were not (ever?) alone!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Did I see the same movie as all you fan boys???,"I only give Superbad a 2 because I do like the young actors, but the material and script they were given was just too unbelievable, unfunny, and unnecessarily gross to be entertaining. I very rarely give up on a movie, and almost always watch until the end, no matter how bitter, but I gave up on this one due to sheer boredom. During the cop/mclovin/cocaine party, my wife and I looked at each other and it was obvious we both had lost interest in what had started as a coming of age teen movie but had become a how gross and stupid can we be movie.Show more of the cute girls, and awkward boy girl moments, not the hard to believe and out of character middle of the movie, which just did not ring true and was not entertaining. I highly DO NOT recommend this movie. Knocked Up was a mixed bag, with the boy girl interaction decent, but the porn site nerd friends unnecessary and unfunny. Superbad was all porn site nerd friends, and super unfunny.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funniest Movie Ever!!!,"This movie is without a doubt the funniest movie ever. If you have never seen this movie you have to either go buy it or rent it. I laughed the whole way through the movie. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera are great together, not to mention their 2 of the best up and coming comedian actors. Seth Rogen of course is hilarious as he always is as in movies like Knocked Up, 40 Year Old Virgin, and Pineapple Express(which was made this year). Plus, Christopher Mintz-Plasse was a great new addition to make this movie that much better. So, if you want a bunch of laughs I highly recommend you get this movie one way or another.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Exceeded my expectations,"I usually don't give comedy movies high ratings because most of the time it's ridiculous and obnoxious kinds of humor. I was a bit skeptical about seeing this movie because it at first seemed like one of those typical high school/college-aged comedies. To my surprise, the movie did have quite a bit of this excessive kind of humor, but I somehow enjoyed it because of the directing and acting. It went overboard and was exaggerated in many ways, but it wasn't absolutely stupid-type humor in movies like Dodgeball or Anchorman. The story is about two best friends on their quest for alcohol and sex and the obvious crazy night that's ahead of them. The movie was surprisingly hilarious and well exceeded my expectations.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It was good,"I thought the first ten or fifteen minutes were the worst part of the movie .. they dragged on and on and were just profanity and teen bravado.And then .. the movie got SOOOO much better. It was funny, sweet, and mostly believable. (Okay, I think the girls were ""hotter"" than those guys could ever have achieved in real life. But otherwise, it seemed relatively realistic to the way teens think and act. Hopefully, not realistic to the way the police think and act, though! ;->)I liked that the plot was not formulaic and contained a number of twists and surprises.

"If you didn't think this movie was funny, you either have no sense of humor or have to watch it again","This movie definitely has Freaks and Geeks humor mixed with Arrested Development humor... Michael Cera's character has a lot of amazingly hilarious moments that you really have to be paying attention to detail to see (not just taking in the general storyline of the movie) This movie isn't about the general storyline, it's about how real these characters are and how hilarious real life high school(and college) is/was for everyone!!!

pathetic,"This movie was NOT funny, but rather a pathetic commentary on how badly American high schools prepare our population to create, uphold and operate a country of ethics, compassion and competency.I keep reading that this movie hits home with viewers, and that it reminds them of their own high school years.That fact makes this movie even sadder.This movie is not just basal and insulting, but it disgustingly selfish and lacks respect for women, intelligence, honor, or character.No wonder our country is so screwed up.

"I thought it would be good, but It was great","I am immensely proud to have this movie come out on my birthday. I actually went to see it that day. It looked really amusing. A stupid humored movie with a dry twist. It was.Superbad was probably the best new movie I have seen in a very long time. Sure, there's been some movies worth watching in the last few years, but this leaves them standing in the dust. It's raunchiness, teenage romance, and it's fall-on-your-ass humor had me laughing for days. It will be known as a all-time classic in the future. I can see kids in ten years talking with each other saying ""that's like what happened in Superbad!"" I recommend you don't drink any beverages during this movie, because you'll be spitting most of it out within the first ten minutes. It doesn't try to be more than it is, and I think that's what makes it so great. I don't recommend taking the kids out to see this movie, but it's pretty much a movie anyone can enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Supergood,"Being a late high school comedy comparisons are naturally with American Pie (the first 2.... everything after that was rubbish) and the like but this is much cruder, much more foul mouthed, the characters are more realistic (apart from the cops obv.).... and a lot funnier as a result.It's not just for teens /early 20's either... hell I'm 32 and roared my way thru it. Can still remember the using fake ids for booze, the parties etc, the hormones.... this film just nails it.First comedy in a while that had me consistently laughing out loud.

Superbad,"Superbad is a new comedy about teenage best friends Seth and Evan who will be graduating high school in a couple days and later going their own separate ways seeing as they both got accepted to different schools. Seth and Evan are very awkward and shy with other students and in particular the girls. After hearing about a party on the last day of school they make a plan along with another friend named Fogell to buy alcohol with a fake ID and bring it to the party and to later hopefully end up with one of the girls they each fantasize about. On the way to the party things go terribly wrong and Seth and Evan end up having one of the most wild nights of their life and an end of a school year that they will never forget. Superbad is about teenagers and the way the film is marketed it will clearly draw in the teenage crowd even though this film is not suitable for anyone under 17 because of the graphic sexual language and situations featured in this movie. The film was written by Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg who apparently wrote the film as teenagers themselves and now years later their script has been made into a movie. Superbad really worked for me for many reasons. First of all I found it very honest and accurate and depicting teenagers and their way of talking and behaving during the high school years. It was so precise in it's attempt to do this that in ways it reminded me of my school days and some of the people I knew and grew up. And as for anyone who doesn't think this is how teenagers talk or act, then they certainly didn't go to a public or high school like I did where this behaviour is so common that it's almost a cliché. I also liked how the film covered the awkward parts of school and social situations as well as dealing with the opposite sex. The way Seth and Evan were so close to each other and avoided all other people to be with each other is probably also more typical of teenagers than most people would realize as well. Some younger people watching the film might wonder if Seth and Evan are homosexuals, but they are not and the film just shows how close they are and as a result of being so socially awkward they have alienated themselves from other people and just focused on their friendship alone which I mentioned above is not all that uncommon. The acting and strong writing also made the movie great because it all played out like a classic comedy that one would (even though they probably shouldn't be) watching as a teenager and like many of the classic teen comedies from especially the '80s such as the John Hughes films or even Fast Times At Ridgemont High, Porky's or from the 90's Dazed And Confused. This film will instantly become a cult hit and a favourite for years to come because of it's great comedic performances, writing and downright hilarious situations these characters are put in. The dialogue while very crude and raunchy is also very well written and believable as well. Not to mention the fact that many films about teenagers cast people who don't even look like teenagers (usually because they are a lot older) and this film has perfect casting. Superbad made me laugh, kept me entertained throughout and reminded me of some of the pleasant yet awkward times of my own years at school. This film along with Hairspray and Knocked Up (featuring some of the same personnel as this film) is one of the most entertaining and fun times I've had so far this year at the movies. And it is one of the best films of the year and destined to become a cult classic and rightly so.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hill's Fast Comedy Style and Cera's Awkward Timing Make For Comedy Gold,"With only a few weeks of school left, two losers are invited to a party being thrown by a girl. They decide not to tell their even more of a loser friend about the party, until he mentions getting a fake I.D. Now they are able to buy booze for the party. The rest of the film follows their antics in trying to get booze and to the party.Superbad was, much like Snakes On A Plane, a much hyped film on the internet. A red band trailer (uncensored) played on the internet and people left right and centre thought it was hilarious. With the success of Knocked Up, another Apatow production, Superbad looked to be not only a hilarious film, but a financially successful one as well. Now that the film has arrived, it seems to have lived up to that hype and better both 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up.While I haven't seen Knocked Up yet, I stated that the 40 Year Old Virgin was the funniest movie of the last couple years and now you can put Superbad right beside it. With the comedic writing style of Seth Rogen, who also has a starring role and Apatow as the producer it was hard for this film to fail, considering the current high ride these guys are on right now. Add to the mix Jonah Hill and Michael Cera as two unknown leads with comedic style just waiting to be seen and you have one funny movie.Hill's fast pace comedic style reminds me of Vince Vaughn and he fits perfectly here in the Apatow crew. Cera's comedy style is clearly in his actions and awkward pauses. Any fan of Arrested Development can see the same style here, which plays off very well with Hill's fast style. The third wheel Fogal, played pitch perfectly by Christpoher Mintz-Plasse, has a style that we've seen before, but taken to another level. Yes, he's a nerd that even nerds find nerdy, but Plasse takes that role and made it his own. It makes one think if they wrote it like that, or he simply took it over. Both Rogen and Hader play the not too old to party police officers who take Fogal, who's actually best known as McLovin, for a ride. With the trailer playing it up big on these two guys and the whole McLovin joke, one would expect it to run it's course fairly early. Yet these three make it fresh and funny with each scene.While it is certainly not original by any means, it earns points for taking a tired genre (highschool kids wanting to get laid and drink booze) and make it relatable to all generations. Something that films from the 80's can't do with kids these days, but Superbad is able to do with the older crowd. It may be the whole retro feel the film has to it, from it's party styles to the clothes our two characters wear.While Hill get's most of the good lines, Cera is the one who gets most of the laughs. His awkward sex moment plays as one of the funniest scenes. It's weird that they are both out-shined by Plasse. Who gets a little too excited in one scene when he has a boner. While both leads have had small fame before hand, with Cera on the hilarious Arrested Development and Hill as 'the fat guy' from recent comedies; it's easy to see this film as their breakthrough roles.Much like Virgin, and I'm assuming Knocked Up, Superbad has a message. Yes, in this raunchy vulgar comedy there is a message about being yourselves and letting some things go in life. You can see these messages coming from the start, but that doesn't effect the film in any way.There are too many moments of hilarity to pick just one. Whether it's Cera awkward singing or Hill's leg being used as a tampon, every scene is just as funny as the one before. The comedy doesn't really let up and is consistent all throughout. With Virgin running a bit too long and Wedding Crashers third act failing horribly, it's hard for comedies to stay consistently funny these days. Superbad doesn't have this problem and if you're a fan of the comedies I mentioned earlier, this film will not disappoint.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Oh wow... name suits it.,"I don't even know where to begin with this one. A friend and I were bored one day and decided on seeing a movie. Superbad happened to catch our eye and we decided to see it. Worst damn decision ever. I'm usually passive with Teen movies as some of them are actually pretty decent. And me being fresh out of High School can somewhat relate. Not to this though. This movie was a complete flop. It tries very hard to be humorous and fails miserably. One of the main characters think they're funny but they're actually just plain stupid. I fail to see how stupidity can be twisted into humor. There were some parts that were somewhat funny but they were too far and few.How anyone can find this crap good is beyond me. Hot Rod even beats this and I absolutely detest that movie. If you're reading this than take my advice. Save your eight bucks and go see a movie thats actually good. If you do watch, you'll find out quickly why its called ""Superbad"".",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Superbad is Super Hilarious !,"I was pretty skeptical going into this movie as I always am with movies like this but I must admit this movie had me laughing from beginning to end. My only rule for a comedy is that if it makes me laugh it's good no matter how stupid it is. You can see the obvious influences of this movie are movies like Dazed and Confused, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Can't Hardly Wait, and American Pie. In terms of laughs this movie hangs with and probably exceeds them all. I can not look at Jonah Hill and keep a straight face, that guy should be a star for years to come. Every generation has a few movies that are quoted and quoted over again and I believe this will be one of those movies much like ""Dazed and Confused"" was for me.

Absolutely fantastic,"I wasn't expecting a lot from this flick after seeing the previews the first few times, I had told myself that most of the funny stuff would be in the trailers, however I was completely wrong. The movie was absolutely hilarious from the start to the finish. After watching Knocked up thinking I hadn't seen a funny movie like that in a long time and wasn't expecting to see on again for many years, I was wrong again.This movie was maybe not better then knocked up but sure does stand up to it. The actors representated their roles really well, Jonah Hill was quite good for a leading role, and Evan and McLovin were very good.I can't remember a movie when everyone were so into it,the crowd was laughing non stop, cheering for the characters and gave it an applause at the end of the movie. This was on a tuesday night a 1 am :) I really don't believe there is any words for this movie other then go see it for yourself and trust me you will enjoy it, if you don't then you really don't like many comedies of this genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Same cast, same crew, still original","I went in opening night for Superbad at the local movie tavern, instead of going to the amazing theater that I never stray from. This movie began with tons of humor thrown at you in your face one after the other and you laughed so hard, you couldn't gain your breath back to hear the next joke because popcorn was still stuck in your throat. Even though Judd Apatow, (Director of Knocked up and The 40 Year Old Virgin) was only a producer in this film, it still had all of the same humor from prior films with this cast. It was basically the same cast with a few new faces. This movie is definitely worth seeing. It has it's moments that are hilarious, but also has it's moments which it is so crude, it's not even funny. I love crude humor, but not this crude. At some points it was just plain dumb, but they managed to keep you in the theater when another hilarious part comes up. Still worth seeing.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Depressing ""Comedy""","The credit sequence was very entertaining, but not long after it ended I began sinking into despair. This movie has received excessively positive reviews - and the fellow across the aisle from me was busting a gut from laughing every couple of minutes - but I kept thinking that if this is what passes for comedy these days, I don't want to see anymore ""comedies."" The only reason I went to see this is because its precursors, ""Knocked Up"" and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" also received extremely favorable reviews; I didn't go see those because I was afraid they would be like, well, like this movie. It's not just that the variations on the word ""fuck"" become really tiresome within the first five minutes, nor the teen-boys-trying-to-get-laid plot has been worked to death; there's just no wit or style to this thing. By the time the obnoxious, way-over-the-top cops came on, I was ready to leave.

It Doesn't Get Much Funnier Than This,"Probably the biggest surprise for me with the movies released this year so far was that a comedy was the best film I had seen, the award going out to Knocked Up. Not since The 40 Year Old Virgin had I laughed so hard at a movie before, and Knocked Up had more than enough outrageous moments to make it shine. But now there's a new comedy out and not only does it prove to be superior to Knocked Up but it manages to be one of the funniest comedies released, period. My friends, welcome to the masterpiece that is Superbad.This comedy follows three seniors who could easily be labeled in the ""Loser"" section or whatever you'd call the low class of students. There's Seth, who's basically the outgoing leader of the pack who tends to talk a load of smack about just about everyone. Closest to him is his high school friend Evan, who basically fills the shy guy part. And finally, there's Fogell who you'll come to know as McLovin; think of him as the idiot who will crack you up in all his scenes.But back to the plot, which starts off with Fogell talking about how he'll get a fake ID which Seth's ""love interest"" Jules asks him to buy booze for her. Before long Evan tells his dream-girl Becca about the scam and he becomes involved too. This then climaxes to a collection of totally outrageous events that hold our heroes from getting to the big senior party. But regardless of the point in the film, Superbad delivers tons of laugh out loud, crude humor that is sure to quench your thirst for great comedic entertainment.The story and series of events in the movie is more-or-less an American Pie meets Harold and Kumar path. You've got some guys trying to get to salvation ala Harold and Kumar and hopefully get into a girls' pants ala American Pie. The movie also goes for a Knocked Up approach by being longer than most comedies, stretching to be just under two hours. While the film does have it's share of dull moments, the longer runtime ultimately brings about more laughs.While many comedies tend to struggle with keeping the laughs consistent while keeping things interesting, Superbad manages to pull this off with ease. And it's not just the pacing and laughs it does well at, the film also does an excellent job in making you love each character. While Michael Cera's character is likely to get a lot boos, Jonah Hill and Mintz-Plasse manage to create two extremely likable characters, especially Plasse. There's also guest actors Seth Rogan (Knocked Up) and Bill Hader (Hot Rod) playing two totally hilarious and crude cops added for good measure who also turn out to bring about a fair bit of laughs.In regards to characters, it's hard to really beat Superbad, because each one feels complete, even if a few could be dismissed as ""panzies"". Like Harold and Kumar and American Pie before it, Superbad makes the main characters and even some of the smaller ones all feel complete and believable. This is also something many comedies tend to miss the mark with, and it's nice to see that this movie made the characters so great.All told, Superbad is definitely the best comedy released so far this year. It puts movies like Hot Rod to shame and manages to surpass the stellar and almost as likable Knocked Up. This is a movie that just about any comedy fan can love, even watching just the first five minutes can make you a fan. Thanks to great characters and constant laughs, Superbad manages to step up and earn itself a spot among the best comedies you'll ever see.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

An accurately vulgar and hysterical representation of high school woes,"After being disappointed by Knocked Up (only in terms of it not completely living up to the legacy I built up for The 40-Year-Old Virgin), I was a little hesitant to get as hyped up for Superbad. Yes, it looked downright hysterical, and yes, everywhere I looked someone was praising it for its comedic excellence. So rather than prep for another disappointment, I held hopes up at a moderate level (and excitement to see it even higher), and I came out finding what is probably the funniest comedy since Virgin.Superbad tells the story of Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera). Both are in their dying days of high school, and have been best friends for as long as they can remember. With change on the horizon for both of them, they look to make the best of things, and attempt to make something of themselves with the girls they have been pining for. After hearing that Jules (Emma Stone) is planning a party for that very night, Seth and Evan are thrown into a day-long odyssey that will test more than just a few of their limits.Yes, it does sound like every other high school comedy with the average kids wanting to lose their virginity before the inevitable trip to college, but there is something sweet and endearing at play here as opposed to the typical comedies of the American Pie form (and just about every 1980's sex comedy). Even though the characterization of anyone other than Seth, Evan and their sometimes friend Fogell (newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse, the one you may know as McLovin) is very one-dimensional, the film gets across the needed messages about friendship and morality. Yes, the trailer may suggest just one long party of a movie without any embedded implications or significances, but when it comes down to it, there is a certain maturity that runs through the movie that is completely lacking in any typical high school related comedy (exceptions including Dazed and Confused, Rebel Without a Cause, the heavily overrated American Graffiti, The Breakfast Club, Fast Times at Ridgemont High and not too many others). It helps itself to overcome the borders of the genre, and truly plunge itself into 'instant classic' territory.What also sets it apart is the genuine authenticity of it all. Anyone who was not the most popular kid in high school can identify with the anxieties and desires of these characters, and if you were anything like me, can probably see a bit of themselves in them as well. Even when the film borders on being beyond raunchy, it still breathes an aura of reality and accuracy that is almost completely missing from the commonality of the genre.What it does not share with those other mature offerings is its vulgar and witty attitude that runs non-stop throughout the film. For any Virgin or Knocked Up fan, you will be right at home with the vivaciously crude dialogue. And much like that movie, even the most offensive of jokes comes off as downright hysterical. There is not one moment in the film where I had more than a few moments to collect myself before laughing again. The punches come furiously, and often, within only mere seconds of each other. Whole pieces of dialogue flew by without me catching them because just about everyone was laughing too hard. Even at it's most genuinely passive or dramatic moments, the jokes keep flying out, and never seem to stop. And much like those two films, you will be quoting the movie endlessly right after watching it. I was a little frustrated with the fact that some of the very best lines in the movie were already in the trailer (and even more in the R-rated trailer), but thankfully there was plenty left just for the film.What the film also shares with those Judd Apatow-produced productions is the general feeling of clunkiness right in-between the second and third acts. I noticed it after watching the Unrated Virgin, noticed it almost blatantly while watching Knocked Up, and noticed it rather subtly here. They all seem to share the problem that there needs to be a lull between these two acts where nothing seems to happen, and the whole film slows down as a result of it. Granted, it is far shorter an amount of time here than it was in the almost draggy Knocked Up, but it is here nonetheless, and takes away from the lasting effect of the film. Thankfully, the jokes continue to pop up during this time, so not everyone should get bored or antsy waiting for the movie to finally continue moving.Acting wise, the film is solid. Hill and Cera play off each other brilliantly, and while they are not quite the odd couple, they do make a great mismatched pair. They handle the most lewd pieces of dialogue with class, and handle the deeply meaningful scenes so subtly that you can barely notice the fact that these kids are swearing at breakneck pace. Mintz-Plasse, although nowhere near as crafty as either of them, practically steals many of the scenes he is in. He has a very obvious easiness with the material, and I can see this guy becoming another potential wonder of the Apatow crew (granted he can overcome his almost instant cult stardom).Supporting turns from Seth Rogen and Bill Hader as two unorthodox police officers weaving in and out of the boys' odyssey are fairly well done, if not slightly stretched out too far. I liked what they brought to the film, but I think they should have been in it a little less.Despite a few minor problems, Superbad is the comedy of the summer, and possibly the best comedy since The 40-Year-Old Virgin. And even with its unrestrained dialogue, it can successfully enter among the greats as being one of the most legitimate depictions of life in high school.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Our Downward Spiral,"After the first 10 minutes of the film, I was thoroughly disgusted with Seth's vocabulary. Judging from the reactions of the majority of the audience (laughing, snickering, even clapping) the antics of high school seniors qualifies as humorous entertainment. Not to me. The movie portrayed today's young adults as slackers, partiers, goal-deprived and just plain stupid in their behavior and thought processes. (Although, I'll have to admit that the liquor purchase sequence in BOTh the supermarket and the liquor store were well thought out and well choreographed, especially Seth's ""mind's eye"".) We saw the worst of our youth in this film. I pray that I don't need assisted living in my old age.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Superbad = Supergood,"Beloved Reader, please glimpse at the star rating below. Yes, I may be just one critic. And this one critic may have given Superbad half-a-star away from the almighty 5. That is because this movie is a rare movie. It is not 4.5-star-worthy in same way as, say, Collateral. It has achieved that rating in the context of other Comedies. In that case, it has gotten that rating for three simple words.It. Is. Hilarious.First off, if you believe the rumours, this started off from the minds of two 13-year-olds. Doesn't sound promising, does it? But when one of them is Seth Rogen (Knocked Up), you know you're safe. Then there were the trailers and other assorted advertising. You could not be blamed for thinking it was another Animal House, or Porky's, or American Pie. Yet, with Judd Apatow (The 40-Year-Old Virgin) producing, this is more than a rehash. No, that would be plain lazy for these pros.There are a few comedy classics with recurring gags. Back To The Future had Calvin Klein. The Big Lebowski had the Rug. Groundhog Day, well, had the whole 24 hours. And one could suppose that Superbad's recurring joke is the Cops. Drunk, incompetent, imbecile cops are something we've seen before. But when two cops flee from sirens that aren't they're own? In such a naturally comical way? That deserves some kudos.As with the cops, we've probably seen the buddy-coming-of-age-flick-with-added-crude-jokes before. But not like this. This clichéd sub-genre of comedy has been kicked in the man-parts. That's both figuratively and literally. That is because, even in the fantasy scenes, it stays true. The daydreams of Seth (the brilliant Jonah Hill) as he prepares to steal liquor. Sure, they are beautifully over-the-top. But it stays true to the paranoia most teenagers have in that situation. Jonah Hill adds those subtle shuffles and shifty eyes. To which, makes you chuckle lightly, before exploding with laughter.All of this adds to why it's so good. One would not expect a film such as this to be good. Deep down, you may go in, and think you will see the same B.S. The same, tired frat-boy jokes you heard years ago cut-and-pasted together. Not here. What starts as a laugh-out-loud farce, turns slightly dark. It starts with conversations of Orson Welles waistline expanding after Citizen Kane. Then it flows to an awkwardly funny car crash. All of which leads up to a climax that suits the previous events. Sure, some may say it is too neat and tidy. But it is fitting to the journey of the guys.The characters of Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) are so magically written. Some of you may carp about them being 'generic'. If that is the case, something has gone amiss. That is there are guys like Seth and Evan out there. Hell, you were probably best friends with them back in the day. To add to them, there is Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Or 'McLovin', as he prefers to be known. He is the mirrored version of Seth and Evan. He knows that his attempts to be cool are embarrassing. Yet, that doesn't stop him.What separates Superbad from the rest of the pack lies on one thing. Real Humour. It doesn't rely on canned laughter. Nor does it rely on forced one-liners. It uses humour in situations that could really happen. Fantastical daydream, or not.4.5 out of 5 Superbad is one Gem of a movie. It may not be a work of 'art', like Citizen Kane (to which was so hilariously name-dropped here). But, if you want your laughs thick and fast, for 2 hours-straight, then here's your answer. As long as you go in with this warning. There will be too many fantastic quotes for you to remember.For movie news, check out www.obsessedwithfilm.com",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen should be behind every comedy,"Superbad...wow. Not only does it take the cake as best comedy of the year, it definitely ranks among the greatest comedies of all time. It's so good that anyone who takes it for what it is and doesn't analyze it bit for bit will enjoy it. On display here is masterful comic acting from all of our stars, not to mention an irresistibly sweet story with lovable characters, all out fun situations, and a night both the characters and audience will never forget.Seth (Jonah Hill; Knocked Up) and Evan (Michael Cera; Arrested Development) are exact opposites. Seth is sex crazed and cocky, while Evan defines sweet and nice. Despite this, the two have been best friends all throughout high school. Now, as their senior year winds down, they realized that they need to throw one party to show everyone that they're more than losers, and to get in their respective crushes' pants. What ensues is the pursuit of alcohol through their idiotic and geeky friend Fogell, better known as McLovin (Chris Mintz-Plasse). Their adventures will lead them through crazy parties, ideas involving detergent containers, and two cops (Bill Hader and Seth Rogen, both of Knocked Up) who seem a little too immature to be cops.You can't say enough about the acting, as everyone is stellar, with Chris Mintz-Plasse and Bill Hader stealing the show every time they're on screen...but this doesn't downplay the talents of Hill, Cera, and Rogen, as all three have great comedic ability. Cera finds ways to make the All American nice guy seem irresistible to women, the audience included, with his shy stutters and uncanny ability to make a simple short line hilarious. Hill's character has been seen before, but it's a breath of fresh air to see how he does it...I noticed a lot of lines that probably weren't meant to be funny, but Hill does things as simple as yelling to get us to laugh. Both of our leading men are absolutely great and have a bright future ahead of them. Chris Mintz-Plasse, or as I will refer to him for the remainder of this review, McLovin, is awesome. Despite this being his first movie, he, much like Hill, turns the simplest line into one of the funniest moments of the film. The guy is simply priceless in the most memorable comedic character of recent memory. Bill Hader and Seth Rogen...wow. Hader is simply hilarious as Officer Slater, and I'm now a huge fan of this guy, much like I am of Rogen. At first, it seems like Rogen plays the same character all the time, but I feel a difference in each character. He has a way of giving us a distinguishable characteristic in each of his characters.Of course, Rogen doubles as a co-writer with Evan Goldberg (Seth and Evan...see the connection?). They wrote the film when they were a mere 14 years old, but it's brilliant comedy helped along by the new King of Comedy Judd Apatow. But when you think about it, it makes sense...teenagers writing a teen comedy. Why didn't anyone think of that before? Rogen and Goldberg write some of the best jokes I've ever heard, and just like The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, they range from layered and intelligent to childish, vulgar, and just plain stupid. Lastly, I haven't forgotten our great director, Greg Mottola. Motolla keeps us entertained for the entire duration, which is thankfully shorter than Knocked Up. There are so many subtle things in the movie that you can definitely see are from the director's mind. Motolla is just a part of this crowd after directing Cera in a few episodes of Arrested Development, and Rogen in Undeclared.Superbad contains some strong and explicit jokes that aren't appropriate for most viewers. Anyone under 17 should wait until they're old enough to understand...or risk getting kicked out by the theater staff.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
You'll be so busy laughing....,"You won't even realize there's a moral to the story until long after you left the theater! Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and Christopher Mintz-Plasse do an excellent job of being the kids you went to high school with. The beauty of this movie is that, as vulgar as it can be and as gross as it can be and as absolutely hilarious as it can be...it is one of the most accurate portrayals of high school life ever to make it to the big screen. Not since Fast Times at Ridgemont High has there been a movie that tells it like it *really* was.Seth and Evan (Hill & Cera) are those guys that were on the fringe in school. Not so nerdy that no one would talk to them, but definitely not one of the ""it"" kids. The plot, such as it is, keeps them on the move throughout the entire movie. Second Act Sag? Not here, baby.And what can I say about the sublime McLovin? The casting department struck gold with Mintz-Plasse as the supremely nerdy but altogether lovable Fogell. You'll laugh so hard at his time spent with the police, you'll need some Motrin and an ice pack by the time you leave the theater.Well written, well acted, and beautifully shot, this movie is 114 minutes of pure fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I had the theater all to myself today...,"...Which is quite good, otherwise I might not have enjoyed ""Superbad"" as much as I did. Director Greg Mottola's new film ""Superbad"" is super-funny and super-good in a number of ways that I didn't think were possible. Part of it, I think, lies in the writing. ""Superbad"" is a well-written film, if nothing else. That praise should go to screenwriters Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Sure, their screenplay is vulgar and profane, but the actors carry it off in such a way that it becomes not only funny, but moving. It's two weeks before graduation and two high school seniors and lifelong best friends who are presumably named after the film's screenwriters - the foul-mouthed, out-going, and sex-crazed Seth (Jonah Hill) and the somewhat introverted, stalwart, and more cautious Evan (Michael Cera) - are facing the possibility of never seeing each other again when Evan and a third named Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) get accepted to Dartmouth while Seth's college plans are an uncertainty because he didn't get accepted. To make long stories short, Evan and Fogell are going to be rooming together at Dartmouth, which certainly makes Seth feel a little left out, like his best bud is bailing out on him. But ""Superbad's"" story gets underway when the two get invited to a party, where two girls - the cute Becca (Martha MacIsaac) and Jules (Emma Stone) - both of whom Evan and Seth are smitten with, respectively, are going to be. So, Seth and Evan are put on alcohol duty. Since, obviously, they're underage, they have to get Fogell (who has a fake ID) to go get the booze at a liquor store. Sounds easy enough, right? (If he doesn't get carded at the cash register first.) But a series of unusually comic events throw their plan into chaos, and wondering how they're going to get the booze for the girls they like, and save the party. On a side note, Fogell gets swept up with two police officers (Rogen himself and Bill Hader) who also proceed to show him the night of his life and recapture some youthful shenanigans themselves. ""Superbad"" is definitely not a movie children should see. With enough adult humor, profanity, and alcohol - all involving teenagers - you can bet this is a show for mature adults. Like I stated earlier, the film's greatest strength lies in the intelligence of its screenplay. From seeing the actors' performances, you understand the frustration the kids go through to simply have a good time before facing life's uncertainties as college freshmen and then later, as adults. Rogen and Goldberg's writing captures all of this perfectly, and the comic timing of the two lead actors in a number of comic scenes is nothing short of brilliant. The jokes fly fast, so does the adult humor and profanity, but ""Superbad"" is a super-cool teen flick, and bound to be yet another fun entry into the teen market.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This film is SUPER-BAD!,"This film sucks! To me, it is just the film ""American Pie"" dressed up, re-shaped and tells the story of hormone-driven teens who decide to drink and try to get laid. Not much story anymore. Every teen movie now-a-day's take the story from ""American Pie"" and try to cover it up and pass it off as an ""original"" story? It's not. Lame over-acting to attempt to make the teenagers of this generation ""laugh""/lame script/lame story that HAS BEEN USED NUMEROUS TIMES IN TEEN-FILMS. I don't know how people can class this as ""comedy."" It was funny first time round when ""American Pie"" was released but now that there is soo many movies released that show hormone-driven teens, under the influence of alcohol who want to have sex, my love for the original ""American Pie"" (which was at one time one of my favourite films) has worn off! Superbad (2007) is SUPER-BAD!!",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Vulgar yet hilarious,"Superbad is another one of those crude comedies in the tradition of Knocked Up, The 40 Year old Virgin, and American Pie. The story was written by Seth Rogen (yep that guy from Knocked Up) and his friend Evan Golberg. By all accounts it seems based on their lives in high school, and yes it is very vulgar, but that doesn't stop the movie from still being hilarious.Two teenagers Seth and Evan (Jonah Hill and Michael Cera) who have been friends forever are finally graduating from high school. After Seth is invited to a graduation party by Jules (Emma Stone) the girl he's been wanting to get with for a long time, both he and Evan are suddenly on a mission to provide alcohol for the party. Evan is of course not sure at first, but when Becca (Martha Maclsasc) the girl of his dreams tells him she's going to be there, he gladly accepts.With the help of their nerdy friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who's getting a fake ID that will make it possible to get the alcohol, the plan is set. However, things quickly start to go wrong when Fogell returns with the fake ID with the hilarious one word name McLovin, and an absurd date of birth. It gets even worse when Fogell goes in to buy the alcohol and is assaulted by a robber who punches him and robs the store. The troubles just escalate when Fogell finds himself suddenly hanging out with two goofy police officers (Seth Rogen and Bill Hader in two hilarious roles) who were called to the crime scene and are glad to take Fogell where he needs to go, but maybe just not right away. Seth and Evan, who believe that Fogell is about to be arrested, panic and take a ride with some sinister individual who takes them to some seedy house party where some dangerous individuals are at. Do the three finally get to their destination? Do Seth and Evan hook up with the girls of their dreams and lose their virginity? I'll not spoil it.Of course the story isn't just about the three guys troubles with getting the alcohol for the party. It is also a story about the friendship between Seth and Evan. You see the two have been friends forever, and after graduation, Evan will be going to some big out of state college whereas Seth will be going to a local school. Both have issues on the subject, and both are frightened of what life will now be like without the other. The movie may be profane, and there are a lot of vulgarities to back this up, but it also has a heart. The underlining theme though, through all the crudeness, still falls back on true friendship.The acting was very well done, and the story, though unbelievably over the top, never lags. Both the writers (Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg) and the director (Greg Mottola) manage to make this one of the better comedies of the year. I found that I liked it a little more than Knocked Up (another good comedy), but that is just one person's opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Best teen movie I've seen.... ever?,"Superbad is destined to become a classic. Although, as other reviewers have said, it is a ""loser trying to get laid"" movie, it is a lot smarter and a lot deeper. Instead of the ""losers"" being unrealistically good-looking (as with all ""losers"" in movies), you have Seth and Evan, whose plights are a lot more believable. You have Seth, who is slightly overweight, sports a jewfro, and has a penchant for drawing penises, and Evan, who is the all-around socially awkward nerd. Fogell, an incredibly awkward dweeb with a squeaky voice and tendency to act like a ""gangsta"", is the duo's sidekick. Together these three spin a wild tale of life in high school, driven by choice funk and classic rock tunes. Seth's character carries the movie, with a loud mouth and an almost poetic ability with insults. One of my favorite moments of the movie was when Seth confronted Fogell about his fake ID which only had one name: ""McLovin."" All in all, I'm very impressed with how a generic and ancient cinematic concept can have such a new and refreshing twist.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
They understand the mind of the loser better than anyone...,"First, this movie is mostly fantastic, though slow in a few places, but will be a classic. If you don't want to read on, at least take that away and go see it.Now, for a bit more depth...The director/producers understand guys. They may not understand girls that well, but they understand guys. This movie was painfully funny in places because I knew those guys in highschool, I was those guys sometimes in highschool. Just like 40 year old virgin and knocked up, beneath the ""filth"" is truth about how not everyone is cool, not everyone can just have the world open up to them, how people can ""miss the boat"" in various stages of life, and yet how you can still try to work it out somehow and make the best of it.Superbad is basically a more realistic take on the ""weird science"" model, and I had a good time with it.And while yes, this movie could have been PG-13 without the over the top vulgarity, it was fine as a vulgar R because that IS how a lot of kids talk and act. Not all kids, no, but a lot of kids do, so why not just show THAT guy? Didn't you know THAT guy in school? I did. Seth (the character) is THAT guy. Evan wasn't really comfortable with the language, nor was McLovin, but they hang with Seth, so that's life. Should we not make a movie about THAT guy because he's vulgar? That's censoring life. Seth doesn't kill anyone, or intentionally hurt anybody. He doesn't glorify violence. So what's so bad about it? That he's a stupid kid with a potty mouth? Horror!I think people who are offended by the reality of how some 18 year old loser behaves need a reality check themselves. Seth's behavior was psychological- obvious COMPENSATION for a life he never experienced. His reaction to his fear of girls and the unknown future was through swearing and pornography, because he didn't have any real life experience to go on. I mean, on more than one occasion, when presented with the reality of the things Seth talks about, he himself freaks out and nearly pukes. That's why it rung true, real, to me. It wasn't as gratuitous as the critics make it out to be. Seth was a real person. A real, really vulgar person.But he ""learns"" a lot about life in 24 hours, and learns his lesson at the end, that girls worth dating may not really be into that sort of thing, and to just chill out. Unlike American Pie, these kids grow up versus just ""gettin' some"" and it rings a heck of a lot truer.And of course, there's totally room for Superbad 2, where Seth visits McLovin and Evan for a weekend in college... ;)",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"That ""once in a while"" movie",I'm gonna keep this short and sweet because nobody likes to read an essay...Superbad was damn funny! It's that type of movie that comes out once every couple years that you tell all your friends they have to see. I think it appeals mostly to the younger part of the population. Can't really see a 45 year old laughing at a lot of the jokes.What makes the film really funny is the fact that that's exactly how a lot of conversations go for the younger crowd. The difference is the movie puts a really funny spin on everything. I was in tears more then once in this movie and my cheeks started hurting a couple times from smiling.Definitely going to see this again before it leaves the big screen.,10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
You may laugh so hard that you soil yourself,"Without duplicating much of what is already posted, Superbad is a great ride. Jonah Hill hits a number of clever and vulgar high notes. Michael Cera does George Michael from Arrested Development, with a dark twist. The new guy - Christopher Mintz-Plasse - steals many scenes with his Stephen Hawking-as-a-drunken-teen looks and dialog. Seth Rogen and a whole cast of characters pop up and help keep things moving while the movie drags a little during the middle. Anyone with memories of friendship, the awkwardness toward the opposite sex, struggles to obtain alcohol as a minor, and about 50 other high school rites of passage will get a kick out of this.

"Awful, boring, pointless","This is one of the few movies I actually went online after watching, just to read one or two pages of bad reviews so I could regain confidence in human kind. I actually chose this movie because it was listed as a top-ranking comedy on the website ""College Humor"". Judging from the other laureates on that site, I should have known better. It's not the fact that the movie uses a lot of gross humor and sexual references. It's rather because every idea in this film seems to end nowhere. Many situations had great potential but seemed to end in a bland void and, while I very much appreciated the character Fogell, this made it all so more frustrating as the whole story around him resulted in totally unbelievable fantasy about those cool, anarchic cops adopting him as their partner in crime. Also, a guy like Fogell would NEVER get laid as a teenager. I can tell 'cause I was that guy. I could imagine wonderful scripts around that person, even involving the other two guys. Unfortunately, what I saw wasn't wonderful at all which brings me to frolic on bad comments and write my own bad review. Something I rarely do.

These 2 characters are so relateable that it makes you laugh so hard at how awkward and crude they are.Nearly everyone has been in the situation of trying to get booze and all of the hassles of getting it can be. That is why this movie is so relateable and I think it is very believable because to me and many people I know the craziest stories always come from the nights you are responsible for getting the booze because you'll go to great lengths to get it.This movie is just flat out hilarious in every way.

"Dirty, very dirty but did I mention it is absolutely hilarious","I must admit I wasn't expecting what I got out of Superbad. Seth Rogen is one of my current favorite actors in the comedy genre and I knew he would perform well and bring some laughs but as for the rest of the cast I was hesitant. Jonah Hill was completely unknown to me and I only knew Michael Cera as the cute, innocent kid from Arrested Development. I was very skeptical if they could bring the laughs that I desired. To top off my hesitation to watch this was the fact I am not a big fan of teen oriented comedies. But I gave it a shot and was on the floor laughing.The story follows two seniors who are about to graduate from high school and who wish to do something 'superbad' before they graduate. Both seek to loose their virginity at a party a fellow student is having with the girls of their dreams. They are told to bring the large amount of beer required and both seek off to obtain. What follows is their zany adventure to obtain alcohol and make it to the party all with the help of their friend Fogell a.k.a. McLovin who has an interesting connection with two local police officers.I must admit I was dead wrong about every question that arose in my head when I saw the previews. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill are both more than capable of bringing tons of laughs to the screen. Even when opposite of more experienced stars like Seth Rogen and Bill Hader. Cera turned out to be more funny of the two though he is actually the quieter one. Hill got annoying a few times in which I had to turn away in disgust but was fine 90% of the time. I guess it was his whinny voice, it just got on my nerves.The movie really did bring back my high school days and some of the crazy stuff that went on during it. Everything was quiet believable, maybe a little hard to come by but nothing seemed impossible that was portrayed in the movie. I guess that made the film even funnier. Everything made sense (unless you count the crazy cops). It really brings back great memories of times of innocence back when we were seniors in high school. Anyone wanting to get back to those times and remember high school memories way want to check this out.Now the film is really dirty. They say f*** around 190 times and most of the time it's uncalled for or at least most parents would say so. There are sexual innuendos at every turn and sex is usually the reason behind most jokes. Heck the plot is based on getting laid. Therefore I would definitely say if you are a parent don't take your kid to this if they are under 16. They won't get it and they'll just learn a lot of words they shouldn't be saying yet. For everyone between 16-30 I think they'll find it hilarious. I don't know about older age groups though.Superbad is funny though it is extremely dirty. It is one of the funniest films I've seen in years. It is a new teen comedy classic that outdoes almost every other comedy coming out nowadays. The film does drag a little in the middle. For about 15 minutes I didn't laugh but other than that the jokes are none stop. Everyone contributes to the comedy and makes you laugh at least once. Just a great comedy in my opinion and hope you feel the same way. Just go see it, give it a chance and you may very well just like it. Look at me. I was very hesitant and found that I loved it.4/5 stars",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

All the jokes where hilarious ( the best part was the first 30 minutes and the middle was a little dry but still great) with jokes from drawn penises to fake ID's.

However, this is a very funny movie with a lot of great scenes, and something that many teen movies don't have..a heart. The main characters Seth and Evan are actually very likable, despite their flaws. Seth is the profane, sex starved fat kid and Evan, along with also being sex starved, is the shy and nerdy kid. When popular girl Jules asks Seth to the party, he claims he can get alcohol with his new fake I.D., when their acquaintance Fogel was actually getting one. The whole movie is about obtaining alcohol and getting to a party, but their are many problems along the way. Evan and Seth try to steal the beer, while Fogel is taken by 2 police officers to the party after being involved in a robbery.""Superbad"" is obviously written based on true experiences, because so much of the writing sounded like true to life situations. The movie had me constantly laughing, but sometimes I couldn't bring myself to laugh at all the vulgarity, and I like vulgarity, but this was sometimes over the top. The characters were all really good, especially Fogel aka McLovin. Occasionally the two cops (Bill Hader, Seth Rogan) are annoying because they are just too stupid, but they mostly made the movie more enjoyable.

A superior teen comedy.,"I thought I'd grown out of these kinds of films the moment I turned twenty. Juvenile jokes and binge-drinking plot lines surely get old after a while - something to be enjoyed thoroughly at the time and discarded in favour of more ""mature"" pictures later on. I know I certainly feel this way about American Pie, and I only saw the first two of those.Every so often though something like this turns up and puts a fresh spin on what is a faded and often cliché-laden tale. Something which comes close to being more than just another teen comedy which plays out with complete predictability and forces the more experienced movie-goer to grind their teeth at the same old archetypes being played out by actors who really can't. Superbad is one of those.The plot is convoluted so much that it becomes part of the humour to see where it'll detour to next. This isn't a bad thing - for those who usually find this genre to be stale, it keeps you on your toes. Luckily this doesn't mean the story becomes so wacky it doesn't have a heart because it does, and there are actually some subtle lessons about not making mistakes that'll stay with you your whole life here, especially towards the end. It's a good balance and with any luck will prompt more than a few ""I've been there"" moments from viewers.For those who seemed to think that the movie was expletive-laden - and worse, full of profanity to cover up poor writing and acting - think again. Yes there is a little, but so what? I've never met anyone of the age portrayed in the picture who doesn't cuss a little, and here the characters are witty and amusing when they're supposed to be. I can't often say that about members of the target audience.Of course, having a likable story and witty jokes is one thing. Having a decent set of actors is quite another. Fortunately, the trio of Hill, Cera and Mintz-Plasse, a cast of relative unknowns, prove they can handle their own and bring spontaneity to their roles. I would wager that some of the more hilarious moments were partially ad-libbed, that the leads took an idea and just ran with it to see what happened, with the best takes ending up as part of the end product. Their interpretations of goofiness and the attempts to be more than just outsiders feel surprisingly realistic, and since they're not Hollywood gorgeous it makes for compelling viewing. Our three would-be heroes are backed up with panache with similarly memorable performances by Seth Rogen as one of two wayward police officers and Kevin Corrigan as the aggressive party host who doesn't suffer ANYONE gladly.The overall impression I walked away with is that life often leads you down some unexpected alleyways when you're just searching for a good time, but if you keep an open mind and trust your moral instincts you'll turn out fine. The fact this is backed up with a really well-chosen multiple genres soundtrack, some excellent non-sequitur twists and a couple of the most hilarious slapstick moments in years (Fogel getting decked is just one) means I've already seen this twice and plan to see it again at some point.A consistently humorous teen comedy with a heart of gold?

wow !!!,"Just one of the best teenage comedies ever made!Really really really funny. If you didn't watched it yet find a way to see it as soon as possible. Really smart jokes and really fun ones. Be prepared to laugh out loud. For the people who is aged +45 years old, we clearly can see in the user ratings report that this is not a really good movie for them. Teens tend more to like this film because its all around them. Drinking partying and we can't forget a lot but a lot of laughs.If you are a teenager you'll really like this movie.

Superbad???????? More like Superhorriblybad!!!!!!!!!!!,"What a bummer of a movie, all the hype for nothing.About 40 minutes too long, and insipidly written, with flat jokes and amateurish pacing and clunky dialogue.Michael Cera is very likable, but it is almost like you can tell he is uncomfortable being in the movie.I definitely expected better from Seth Rogen; maybe next time.And to think people here are calling it the best teen comedy since ""American Pie"". This movie is far from being close to that one by a longshot.3 younger couples left before the halfway mark.You have been warned.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
wow,"This movie was so well written and honestly quite entertaining. I think that 3/4 of the people here who write negative comments on this movie either (A) have no sense of humor and then i completely understand, or (B) Used to draw penises themselves when they were younger, wet their pants when they were younger, couldn't get laid in high school, got spit on by a bully, and cannot get past the fact that a movie actually talked about it. The reason that Seth Rogen wrote this movie was to possibly humor his own problems as a kid in high school. I mean granted it is improbable that he drew cocks as an 11 year old. This movie overall honestly explained a very typical time in high school whether it be your senior year or sophomore year. It is all about proving yourself to other in an attempt to either get laid or just fit in. God only knows that most people have gone through this, maybe even later in life.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Super Funny !,"Although this is a teen movie, and yet another teen ""gross out"" movie, I'm in my 50s and enjoyed it very much. However, I will add a warning to that: my wife and I first rented the video, and couldn't watch it because it was too graphic and gross, but I ended up seeing the ""sanitized"" version on TV which I liked very much. It all goes to prove that you really don't need the extremes to be funny.It also proved that not much has changed since I was a teenager. The story line is simple and basic: the nerdy kids who are going to be graduating from high school and going their separate ways are looking to have a booze-fest party, and get lucky with some girls in their class.What distinguishes the movie, however, is the characters themselves, who essentially start together, then go their separate ways in the night of partying at unexpected places, and eventually linking back up in the end. Their journeys are hilarious, particularly that of ""McLovin"" who creates this identity on a fake ID and ends up spending this night in the company of two totally inept cops.It ends up as a fun adventure, with a lot of laughs, nostalgia for those of us who are older, and of course, a happy ending after all the uncertainty of the boys big night out. It remains unique however, and shouldn't be compared to ""American Pie"" of other teen movies of this genre due to that, but if you like those, you'll like this.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Classic To Remember,"During our years we have seen many movies that talk about high school problems, well actually try to show us how their life goes in High School, but none stayed to amaze us like Superbad. This movie started and finished with me spilling milk out of my nose, and i only had a coke to drink. Superbad starts with some cheesy and ''gruesome'' (How a lady next to me referred it as) jokes which couldn't have been said better then by Jonah Hill and Micheal Cera. The jokes in this film are so well written and so well said.Jonah Hill(Seth) is the type of nerd that fantasizes about his first sexual experience during class, he is also the type of friend you won't be ashame to have as he is acting anxious all the time.Micheal Cera(Evan) is the type of guy that respect's a woman's mind and doesn't shift gear in a second.This movie brought me to tears of laughter from the first second the intro started. If you need a movie to make you laugh about Current High School problems, watch this one and you won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An Brilliant And Hilarious Teen Film. A Modern Comedy Classic From The Judd Apatow Group.,"Superbad is an hilarious Teen film and a modern Comedy classic. An amazing mixture of great laughs,great direction,a wonderful cast and a hilarious script,Superbad is my favorite Judd Apatow film and easily one Apatow's best films.Superbad tells the story of teenagers Seth(Jonah Hill)and Evan(Michael Cera),two High School seniors and best friends who are on the verge of graduation who are invited to a High School party and have to get beer and alcohol. With the help of their friend Fogell(Christopher Mintz-Plasse),Seth and Evan have to deal with growing apart,dating their High School crushes and getting into hilarious and bizarre situations in one crazy night.Superbad is a brilliant and funny laugh a minute Teen Comedy that is an instant classic from the moment you watch,an hilarious Comedy that follows the great,grand tradition of other great Teen films like American Grafititi and Dazed And Confused taking the laughs and heart of those two films and mixing them with ingenious laughs of Animal House. The first five minutes of Superbad set the tone for the rest of the film where in Superbad there are jokes and laughs that are just non-stop and like many of Judd Apatow's films mixes raunchy Humor and wild,over the top characters with honesty and great depth. The great laughs and moments in the film are driven by the characters and their dialog which are in the real world but the characters and dialog is so wild and over the top you would think that Superbad took in an alternate reality that is very stylized and any that can happen will happen. Although the film has a lot of Comedic dialog,Superbad also has a lot of Slapstick and physical Comedy that is done so well that the great Slapstick Comedy will have you in tears because of the absurdity and wild crazy insanity of each moment. Superbad is great Teen film because like some of the best Teen films the characters while over the top are real and seem like true and accurate depictions of Teenagers and the dialog which is how Teens talk and even though there is sexual related dialog and some sexual activity there is no nudity in the film. Another reason Superbad is great Teen film is that there are no typical Teen movie conventions in the film,there are no popular and evil Stock Teen movie characters such as Jocks,Cheerleaders or other Teen stereotypes in the film because Superbad is told from the outcasts P.O.V. I'm so glad most of the typical Teenage conventions are pretty much gone,not mentioned and nonexistent. What I also love about Superbad is that this film takes place during the course of one day and night because when a film is set during one day anything can happen in one day that can change a persons life and in this film the things and events that happen in this film wild,funny,unpredictable and very surprising. The screenplay by Seth Rogan(who also co-stars in the film)and Evan Goldberg is fantastic and well-written and has memorable dialog that will be quoted for years. The three main Superbad characters Seth,Evan and Fogell are great Teen characters we can relate to because when we watch the film we feel we knew the main characters in High School because they are outcasts who don't necessarily want to be popular but just want to date their crushes and be liked before their High School days end. All three characters do wild and crazy things but they are likable and have multiple-dimensions that make them rise above who and what they are. At 114 minutes the film Superbad moves at a great pace and the film has a wonderful energy that never slows until the end and you are glued to the screen because you never want the film to stop. The ending of Superbad is funny, wonderful and sad because when you watch the film you going to wonder what will happen to the characters Seth and Evan and Superbad leaves the viewer with a lot of questions. A great ending.The whole cast does excellent jobs in their roles. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera are brilliant and hilarious as Seth and Evan,with Hill and Cera bringing laughs,depth and great chemistry. Christopher Mintz-Plasse(in his film debut)gives a funny and excellent performance as Fogell AKA McLovin,Seth and Evan's friend. Bill Hader(Officer Slater) and Seth Rogan(Officer Michaels)are funny,delightful and over the top as the cops who have fun with Fogell. Emma Stone(Jules)and Martha MacIsassc(Becca)are fantastic and beautiful in their roles as Seth and Evan's love interests. Aviva(Nicole),Joe Lo Truglio(Francis The Driver),Kevin Corrigan(Mark)and Clement E. Blake(Homeless Guy)give fun performances as well.The direction by Greg Mottola is wonderful,with Mottola always moving the camera and giving the film a great energy and visual style. Great job,Mottola.The score by Lyle Workman is great and memorable and reminds me of the scores from the 1970s. A fine score by Workman. The soundtrack also has great songs by The Bar Kays(Too Hot To Stop,Soul Finger),Rick James(Bustin' Out(On Funk),The Four Tops(Are You Man Enough),Ted Nugent(Stranglehold),Van Halen(Panama),Curtis Mayfield(P.S I Love You),The Notorious B.I.G(Big Poppa),Motorhead(Ace Of Spades),K.C And The Sunshine Band(Boogie Man)and more. Great soundtrack.In final word,if you love Judd Apatow,Comedy films or Teen films,I highly suggest you see Superbad,an hilarious and funny modern Comedy classic that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Good, Original Movie","Superbad, a 2007 teen sex comedy, chronicles the adventures of two high school seniors on a quest for sex and alcohol. The film showcases the main characters, Evan and Seth, as the typical high school losers who are joined by their sidekick, Fogell. After Evan and Seth are invited to attend a party by the popular girls of their dreams, they engage on their quest to obtain the alcohol for the party.Superbad hits all of the cultural landmarks of classic teen comedies yet it also display refreshingly original humor. The film is consistent with teen sex comedy themes: high school seniors on a quest for sex, the majority of films in this genre surround the party scene and friendship transcends.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Superb Movie!!!,"I love this movie. Straight Up. I first saw this film when it went into theaters a couple of years ago, I ended up going another 2 times that week because of how much I liked it.

All those actors are great and complete this brilliant comedy, the story is meh (thats why I took one star off.) but it is executed so perfectly that that doesn't even matter.

A Surprisingly Beautiful Tale of Friendship/ The Funniest Movie I've Ever Seen,"2007's Superbad meets the classic criteria of an Apatow production; it's a bit longer than the typical R-rated comedy, the film's writers (Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, not Apatow) try to mix raunch humor with some sort of message, and it has a cast of familiar faces including Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen. This film is hilarious. The entire film mixes immature and crass humor with a level of intelligence. The jokes alone make this film worth a watch and worthy of a relatively high IMDb rating. However, Michael Cera and Jonah Hill actually do some heavy lifting when it comes to acting. The unlikely duo play lifelong buds who have to deal with something very common to the American teenager: life after college and the changes that come with it. While McLovin and the immature cops (portrayed by Rogen and SNL's Bill Hader) make us laugh in the movie, Cera and Hill make us think about the life of the American teenager and make this a very good film.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Brilliant.,"It was summer 2007 and I went to the cinema with some friends thinking that we were about to see a horror film called 'Superbad'. Bear in mind that Cera, Hill and Rogen weren't that famous (at least in the UK) then - I had no idea what was coming.Raunchy comedies about teens/young adults looking to get laid are nothing new. But just occasionally comes a film which has a bit more to it, a film which is as deep as it is 'gross-out' and funny. In the 1990s/early noughties we had 'American Pie' and now we have Superbad.It takes place in the run-up to a big party (being hosted by the stunning Emma Stone) and a pair of losers are looking to get booze so that they can get their possible dates drunk and go from there. Their friend Fogell (who becomes McLovin) agrees to help them - but of course, as with all comedy, what must go wrong will go wrong. But unlike many comedies it never gets tedious.Whenever I watch the ending I always wish there could be a sequel where the two characters are at college, but then again sequels often ruin good films.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A Hilariously Written Classic That Stands the Test of Time (But with Some Caveats),"Superbad is an uproariously funny coming-of-age comedy that stands the test of time. From its cleverly written script to its unforgettable characters, this film is a classic that has continued to be celebrated since its release in 2007.One of the things that sets Superbad apart from other comedies is its brilliantly written dialogue. The banter between the main characters, Seth and Evan, is hilarious and incredibly authentic. The film's writers, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, clearly drew from their own experiences as teenagers to create a story that is relatable and genuine.However, it's important to note that some of the language and jokes in the movie may not be as acceptable in today's society as they were back then. While the film's humor is undeniably effective, some of the language used towards women and the LGBTQ+ community could be considered offensive by today's standards. It's important to watch this movie with an awareness of these issues and to recognize that humor can evolve over time.Despite these concerns, Superbad remains a timeless classic that captures the essence of teenage life in a way that few other films can match. The chemistry between the film's main cast, including Michael Cera and Jonah Hill, is electric, and their performances are endlessly entertaining.Overall, Superbad is a brilliantly crafted comedy that showcases the talent of its creators and performers. While some of the film's humor may not hold up in today's society, its wit and charm continue to make it a must-watch for anyone looking for a good laugh.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Seth Rogan, you go girl!","This is one of the funniest movies in a long time. A great cast of talented people well place in a dynamite script. A great time to sit in the theater. This is not a chick flick but anyone who was ever a young male, will relate to this great coming of age film. My wife found this humorous most may not feel warm and fuzzy with this film. But trust me, men, boys and the household pet will find this to be one of the finniest films in a long time. The story moves and has several funny funny moments, so many that I lost count. You must see this film, it will take you back to the days when you were in high school and that for some of us was a special time in our life's. See this in the theater it's better when you can other guys laughing. So there you have it a great way to spend some at the theater.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Superbad doesn't have the most original script but it got a lot of heart, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have created a phenomenal experience","Superbad is directed by Greg Mottola and it's a coming-of-age comedy film that is written and loosely based on Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg own experiences, and the interesting part is that the script began development when they were 13 years old. You can easily see throughout the movie and the writing that this is a passion project for the two, if you can call it that.The film stars Jonah Hill and Michael Cera as Seth and Evan, two teenagers that's about to graduate high school. Before graduating, the boys want to party and lose their virginity, but their plan proves harder than expected and we get to see their entertaining adventure. On paper this isn't really an original concept but it's the script, direction and the actors that make it worth your while and dare I say among the best comedy films out there.The supporting cast is filled with big names like Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Bill Hader, Seth Rogen and Emma Stone. I like them all and each character is written realistically, maybe not the police officers that are played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader but their characters are in the most funniest scenes. The chemistry that they have and honestly the whole cast, it made me smile at certain times and laugh at different times. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera deserves the most praise though, their characters are best friends and it looks so genuine.Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg created a funny and remarkable script that is full of heart, easily among the best of their scripts. Superbad is probably a movie that I'll be coming back to, the characters and humor is perfect. I'm so glad that Seth and Evan tried to write a script at the age of 13, it lead to this memorable comedy film.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It's a must see if you're into comedy films.,"One word to describe the film? Genius.I was tempted to watch the film when I saw the actor line up. Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse & Jonah Hill in the same movie? Damn.Not all of the similar films were a success, and just because these actors starred in it doesn't confirm it's standard. But it was just jaw-dropping. The jokes were original, the acting was superb, and the storyline was great.The characters in the film were perfectly matched by the actor. The soundtrack was great and just like in real life, the best friend fantasised about his friends mothers breasts.I don't think I have a comedy film I can say is better than this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Super Good ""Superbad""","In the opening rift between our heroes Evan (Michael Cera) and Seth (Jonah Hil) on their drive to school, it is transparent from their explicit, crude, hysterical exchange that these graduating seniors want desperately to get laid before heading off to college. Theirs is a noble pursuit. Well, at least the honest pursuit for our geeky duo. Like the characters of ""Superbad"", the writers share their names, Seth Rogan (of ""Knocked Up"") and Evan Goldberg. Seems that ""Superbad"" is somewhat biographical, which lends insight. Amidst all the movie's outsider teen angst and exaggerated sexual bravado, Director Grag Mottola's ""Superbad"" is ultimately about growing up and lasting friendship. Mottola strikes a unique balance and tone. ""Superbad"" is definitely not for kids with its graphic language, sans any explicit sex; however, it is amazingly bitter sweet. For the creators of ""Superbad"", they ignored any conventions of taste and their story is boldly sentimental and personal. ""Superbad"" has an authentic ear for male teen speak. Smart and shy Evan expresses, ""Just imagine if girls weren't weirded out by our boners and stuff That's the world I one day want to live in."" Yes, that would be a perfect world. There is a lot of funny stuff in ""Superbad"".Evan (Cera) and Seth (Hill) are childhood friends, who are about to graduate from High School. Evan and Seth also face separate futures. Evan is going to Dartmouth in the fall. Seth, unable to get in, will attend State college. These final weeks of High School for them represent their last chance to ""score"" before heading to college and their new lives. Evan and Seth are uncool geeks, though in a charming way. Evan is the tall smart silent dork, who is sweet on Becca (bubbly and cute Martha Maclsaac). Seth is the smart ass overweight kid, who has a non-zero chance of getting laid on his own, and is such a drama queen about not getting any. Seth hooks up with pretty Jules (spirited Emma Stone) in home economics class. Her parents are out of town, and she is throwing a party. Jules would be indebted if Seth can obtain alcohol from her party, ""You scratch our back and we'll scratch yours."" Classy Seth replies, ""Funny thing about my back it's located on my"" Suddenly, all relies upon Evan and Seth's buddy Fogell (very funny Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who has a fake Hawaii driver's license as organ donor McLovin. For those who have seen the trailer, the classic line is: ""Yes, I am McLovin."" However, something ridiculously goes wrong at the liquor store, and officers Slater (Bill Hader) and Michaels (Seth Rogen) are called to the scene. From this point high jinx and debauchery abound.Rogen and Goldberg's storytelling takes apparent tangential and hysterically tasteless turns, but there seems to be a point to the chaos. The telling betrayal is not about girls and sex, rather it is about friendship. To that end ""Superbad"" works, because of its strong performances and Mottola's natural direction. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill are amazing comedic partners. Although, they have their bitchy moments, their underlying love for each other in spite of themselves makes ""Superbad"" strangely poignant. Cera has a comfortable charm and innocence even in Evan's most uncool moments. He has a great line while pulling himself together,"" Calm down She wants to suck on your"" We have a genuine affinity and familiarity for Cera as Evan. Hill as Seth has the funnier lines. Hill is an amazing dorky smart ass. He also wisely tempers Seth's vulnerable side, and shows Seth's human side when he lets his guard down. Christopher Mintz-Plasse practically steals the movie as ""McLovin"". Mintz-Plasse has a nerdy ease and brilliance. What he does is play Fogell as a good kid, who just wants to be cool. As Fogell, he finds that he is cool, when he isn't trying so hard. He has a hysterical scene where he dances with hot Nicola (Aviva).The ending of ""Superbad"" got me. No worriesthis does not give anything away. With all the hilarious raunch, the message is that things happen when they happen, and given a choice good people will do the right things. I did not expect that from ""Superbad"". It is a laugh out loud expertly written movie, well worth seeing. ""Superbad"" is the smart, funny movie of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

What a surprise!,"Wow, I never saw that coming! I had seen a few previews of the movie and thought it would be OK. Also, since it has ""George-Michael"" in it from Arrested Development, I assumed it might be worth watching for that alone (the reason most people saw Licensed to Wed - for the Office cast members). When browsing the local movie choices at a dollar theater, it was one of the choices, so I looked at an online review source and noticed it had many good reviews. Now I was intrigued. Also, I noticed this was directed by the Coen Brothers. Maybe this movie is a sure thing? Upon seeing it, I was totally stunned. This may be one of the top 5 teen movies of all times! Sure, it still has a few tired premises, but does it so well that you don't notice so much. The best part is that this movie is SO funny. It packs more laughs per minute than anything I can think of. The only weird thing about this movie is that I have not heard more about it. Had this film been promoted a little more, it would surely be the Porkys of this decade, no question. Had this been an 80's movie, it would have been right up there with the best from Hughes! This is highly recommended, well, unless you are a stodgy old person.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Okay, I am not the target demographic for this film, left that behind a few decades ago, but even so, this film leaves much to be desired. I got the jokes and gags, they just didn't do anything for me. I can recall talking (to a point) like these kids do, and I did think it was cool at the time. Now I realize that it was boorish and idiotic. I do have to compliment a couple of the young actresses, Martha MacIsaac, who looked awfully nice, and Emma Stone, who pulled off that ""teenage girl who is sophisticated beyond her years"" role. The two cops were painful, and none of it clicked at all, and so was totally unfunny. There is really no reason to watch this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Move over American Pie, Superbad has dethroned you","This movie is absolutely, deliberately funny. I just saw it last night at my cousin's house and I laughed my ass off throughout the whole movie. Jonah Hill is so hilarious in that movie, and I gotta say, although American Pie has been the funniest teen comedy of all time, this movie has actually been the key to dethrone it.That was my absolute opinion last night when I saw it. This movie is easily 100 times better than American Pie, I swear to God. There are also many things to learn like, getting to second base with your crush, failed crushes, first kisses and getting drunk for the first time in a party.This movie filled the whole summer with laughs and chair falling while having fun non-stop all the way. I give this movie an 8 out of 10. This year in my list this is the second best 2007 movie after Transformers.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Funny, subversive, and surprisingly authentic take on high school life","With Judd Apatow in the producer's chair, and Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg as the writers, comedy fans are almost guaranteed for a hilarious, raucous experience. This comedy directed by Greg Mottola sets a funny and surprisingly realistic take on life as a high schooler and the utter debauchery that teenagers engage in to have the time of their lives while their days of drinking and partying like animals are numbered. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera play Seth and Evan (named after the writers), two high school seniors who have been the best of friends for a long time and are dealing with separation anxiety as they are anticipating their last school year together before moving off to separate colleges. With no party plans on their agenda, Seth and Evan are invited to a party hosted by their crushes Jules (played by Emma Stone) and Becca (played by Martha MacIsaac). But there is just one thing: they need booze. This is a problem since the fact that they are not 21 but luckily they get help from their geeky friend Fogell (played by Christopher Mintz- Plasse) who obtains fake IDs to mask themselves as of legal age. However, their mission to get to the party with booze becomes difficult when they face seemingly endless array of difficulties including Fogell's run-in with two amateur cops Officer Slater (played by Bill Hader) and Officer Michaels (played by Seth Rogen) who slow their plans down.Teen comedies typically come in two different categories, one is a comedy where teenagers are involved in situations that are plausible in reality but typically don't happen outside of Hollywood films. Then there is a small minority of comedies that veer closer to reality, and this film sits more toward this category. This film written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg who were only 13 years old at the time they wrote this, blossoms an insanely funny, clever, and unlike most comedies, an authentic take on high school experience thanks to its smart script. The plot sets a fair demonstration of just about everything a high school boy fantasized about when it came to making his way into the popular crowd, ranging from losing his virginity to the girl of his dreams, to getting his hands on booze, to going to a party for a wild night of drinking, sex, and dancing to loud music; many thing teens and adults can relate to. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera are both hilarious as their characters, and have plenty of funny (and vulgar) dialogue for the most of their time on screen. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is also quite funny and equally likable, especially during his moments with Seth Rogen and Bill Hader playing police officers. Their comedic chemistry together hits home and serves as a pinnacle of endless laughter as much as Jonah Hill and Michael Cera, plenty of vulgar sex jokes typical for the Judd Apatow fare here and there, most of the hit well while a few are a bit misfires. While these actors are funny, they also show a fair side of sweetness and smarts, particular when they come to clever terms with the girls of their dreams.Superbad is super-funny, super-smart, and show Jonah Hill and Michael Cera at arguably their comedic talents. This movie makes a good pick for any comedy fans looking for a funny and subversive experience in a high school setting. Of course, this film is probably not for everyone, particularly those who don't bode well with raunchy humor and vulgar- filled humor by teenagers. Otherwise, this film is worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Don't get it,"Tremendously overrated movie. Wants to, apparently, be underage ""Dazed and Confused,"" but falls so short. It's a movie that tries to throw up its comedy in your face, which is really not effective.Jonah Hill is such a loser in this movie, as he is in everything he's been in since, regardless what Leonardo di Caprio seems to think.Steer clear no matter what your friend says. Watch ""Dazed and Confused"" (1993) or maybe ""The Stoned Age"" (1994) and you'll get more. Not as many future millennial stars, but is that really a problem?",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Awesome.,"This was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my entire life. The jokes were funny, and the whole movie had a ""real"" feeling to it as if this stuff could really happen.The actors hit their characters spot on, and moved the story along nicely.There wasn't any of the ""let's stop the funny to have a tender and emotionally intense hour-or-so for the sake of the plot"" that I see in a million other comedies. So throughout the whole movie, there is always something to laugh at. Which is the point of a comedy in the first place I might add.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Who cares if it's vulgar?  This movie was awesome!,"Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg bring us one of the funniest teen comedies in years. Yet another Judd Apatow produced film with the usual cast and crew providing us with one of the funniest movies of 2007. Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) are best friends on the verge of graduating high school and they are given the opportunity to gain some popularity AND score with the girls they've adored for years...all they need to do is supply the booze for Jules's (Emma Stone) graduation party. The movie plays out over the course of one night as they try to score the alcohol by any means possible while everything that could go wrong, does.This movie is hilarious! I've been a fan of Apatow and crew since their first feature and now we have a film co-written by one of the funniest actors in modern Hollywood (in my opinion), Seth Rogen. For the sensitive types out there, do yourself a favor and find entertainment elsewhere because this movie is definitely vulgar (though not to my desensitized mind). Curse words and sexual comments pretty much fill the nearly two hour running time (if you have the extended edition, which I recommend). Despite the excessive vulgarity, you can tell the movie doesn't rely on it for its comedy. There are a LOT of genuinely funny moments in this film and that's mostly due to the performances.This film gathers a lot of great comedic talent in one place. I haven't seen much of Jonah Hill before but I thought he was great in the role of Seth, and Michael Cera subdued comedy was a perfect counter to Jonah's loud, angry rants. Christopher Mintz-Plasse makes his film debut as Fogell (aka McLovin) and his scenes are some of the best in the movie. As soon as he's joined by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader as the cops who pick him up, the McLovin subplot almost becomes it's own movie and you wish there was more. I would seriously love to see this group come together for another film (though not necessarily a sequel to this movie). Great comedic performances, a perfect cast, and a raunchy teenage sex story (with some heart, though some wouldn't believe it) come together to once again prove that Apatow and crew are on top of the Hollywood comedy scene.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Funny but kind of sucked,McLovin and the cops nailed it....only them otherwise the flick wasn't worth the hype.,5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Brilliant comedy about friendship.,"Teenage years are a fuzzy and confusing time. The greatest reflections on teenage life are the ones that manage to capture the almost total isolation teenagers feel in their lives from the rest of the world, teens view the world through narrow eyes. This short sighted vision inevitably leads to concentration on certain factors that become less important as time goes on. In those hectic and unpredictable years the biggest issue focused on is almost universally sex. You could be fooled into thinking this movie is about the frustration and desire concerning sex, but you'd be wrong. The movie uses the quest for sex as a gimmick to keep the plot moving forward but ultimately the movie is about the friendship between the two main characters and it is this saving grace that really elevates Superbad above the usual teen comedy. The sub-plot that follows McLovin on this eventful night has almost been overshadowed by a catchphrase but it's the dorky cops who make that element of the film shine so brightly, in a typical teen comedy authority is something to be dodged and in a brilliant twist they've turned that on it's head, with genuinely fantastic results.Superbad is a brilliant comedy, with some fantastic one liners and some excellent turns from the players, but what makes it brilliant is the ease which we can all relate to these two best trying to have a good time.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What a wondrous surprise...,"I have to say, I only watched this due to the rating it had got IMDb. I am not normally into comedies, particularly ones that involve American teenagers coming of age sort of thing. The last similar one I watched was American Pie, which although I can understand why people did find it funny, it was not for me. This however was surprisingly hilarious and at times had me laughing out aloud. I would say that men more than women would prefer this film as for me part of the humour was looking back to me male teen years and thinking 'Yes, thats exactly right.' and cringing with embarrassment. In hindsight however, these incidents were funny. The film manages to hit home very well the awkwardness of situations which are of your own doing, and the one track mind of being an adolescence. Throw in some bizarre behaviour by some of societies so called respectable members and the story never really slows down. But for me it has to be the one liners throughout the film, the ones that I have made up my mind to remember but am never able to. I found it so good I was able to watch it twice in 24 hours due to my wife wanting to watch it the next day.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An Outstanding Effort,"Many others have already posted great observations about Superbad and why it's a top flight coming-of-age-story/raunchy comedy. I agree..., the film is a strong accomplishment. Accordingly, I'll maintain brevity.I'm 35 years old and can attest that high school in the late 1980s was quite akin to the situations Seth, Evan and Fogel (McLovin!) experience throughout the long day's journey into one of their last high school Friday nights.Combined with lots of realistic, for high schoolers, crudity/awkwardness(awkwardness breeds crudity in high school kids, folks--it's called nervous energy) and copious laughs, is a rare, non-manipulative, poignancy.Selah.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Love it,"This film is so awkward, it's incredibly funny and feels authentic to teenagers. Very well written, not my usual type of film but should go down as one of the classics. Acting is spot on, couldn't think of any improvements.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Brilliant!!,"To be frank, I was expecting this to be yet another garbage-level teen romp flick. However, given the strong reviews from critics, I thought I'd check it out. Wow, what a fantastic surprise this movie turned out to be. The script is very cleverly done and the performances are outstanding.The movie is basically about three high school seniors who are trying to get laid before starting college. The only problem is that they're closer to nerds than jocks. The most ambitious of these three figures out that a great way to score is to promise to bring alcohol to a party. And so begins their underage quest to acquire liquor ...What is incredible about the script is that the characters and situations are entirely believable. Yes, lots of extreme things happen in the story, but they are acknowledged as such and flow beautifully with the way the characters are conceived.The performances of the three main actors, along with the two police officers in the movie, are excellent. In fact, the five of them carry the entire movie. They deliver some hilarious lines in way that sounds like they really believe what they're saying! They're all so interesting and fun to watch that it's a shame that we only get them for one movie.This movie is for mature teen audiences on up. If you're looking for an intelligently written and funny movie, definitely check this one out.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Superbad was really super bad...,"How stupid can you really get? Horny teenagers? Incompetent cops? Alcohol? Sounds like fun, right? Well, it is, but only if your idea of fun involves knowing your brain cells are dying a horribly painful death while you're in the theatre. Then again, if you're that desperate to ruin your life, there are probably more efficient things you can be doing anyways.Superbad delivers in the department of laughs because the jokes are oftentimes unexpected. Clichés pervade the movie, but several scenes are genuinely hilarious. The rest of the movie is vulgar, rude, and debasing. If you're into that kind of stuff, this is a movie worth watching. It might even work as a date-movie. However, the one thing Superbad lacks is intelligence.Basically, you see the story of three Seniors due to graduate unfold as they try to buy alcohol with a fake ID. From there, it all goes crazy. The writers seem to have missed that crazy doesn't always equal funny. Then again, if you want to see funny, go buy Knocked Up instead.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"REALLY didn't want to see it, but it WAS funny as hell!","Seth Rogen and the other cop REALLY brought this movie alive and totally separated it from other teen/party movies.I normally Don't even like Seth R. , however he was friggin hilarious and so was the other cop.The movie just KEPT rollin with laughs...every time you though it was going to slow down, something in the plot just Changed and kept building up laughs!This movie will be quoted for A LONG time....since it's got tons of quotable lines....TONS of F-bombs and some sex terms and jokes(not as many as you'd think), but still wouldn't wanna watch it with parents or anybody you might feel uncomfortable around!----Basically, a couple teens are trying to score a bunch of alcohol for a big party, and things just keep going wrong or throwing them off track.

Super success!,"Now this here is a movie, a new type of comedy, not like any other cliché horrible teen drama/comedy, this here is the real deal, full of characters you are guaranteed to love so much, the randomness/stupidity is NOT horrible but actually hilarious and widely entertaining, the comedy grosses a high level not to mention the non stop laughing dirty sex jokes to. The picture of the movie may look old but that what makes the movie even a lot more brilliant, the style of it may look old like an 80s graphical movie when it actually came out in 2007, I guess the picture style of the movie is perfect for a teen movie like this.

The king of 2000's raunchy comedies. A classic worthy of living on for generations to come.,"This review is dedicated to the memory of Blockbuster.Sometime in on a weekend in early 2011, my mom and I went up to Blockbuster (when it was still widespread) and she let me rent Superbad. As a sixth grader at the age of 12, this was a big honor, and naturally I was going to enjoy the film. I did, but I enjoy it more than ever now as an adult.For this review, I watched the film again on Netflix (which was the theatrical version and not the Unrated Extended Edition I also own). The plot of the film follows two best friends (nice guy Evan and caustic Seth) who are going off to two different colleges and facing separation anxiety. The first 15 or so minutes of the film firmly establishes this while containing a variety of sex jokes. Those sex jokes quickly subsidize a little around the 30 minute mark where the film picks up. By that point, the opportunity to buy booze for a party that their respective high school sweethearts are having lands in Evan and Seth's laps, with their mutual friend Fogell acquiring a fake ID with the name McLovin on it. From there, the plan goes awry and things change direction for the sake of hilarity ensuing, and the comedy is done well.The cinematography and editing are seamlessly done, with the dialog and acting ranging from hilarious to a trifle over exaggerating. It barely works, but as a first time viewer, it's perfect. It sticks with you.Now back to the story. It's well written for what it is, and very well paced, especially considering the fact that Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg based the script loosely off of their own lives as high school seniors.Overall, Superbad is a film that deserves recognition in the years to come. It's a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An apt name,"American Pie meets Jackass in a head-on collision of gross, badly scripted and poorly acted scenes that have no right to be called a movie. This dire waste of celluloid is an insult to audiences, a cynical attempt to produce a formulaic teen comedy which steals ideas from a hundred films that have done it before, and done it a hundred times better.This is one of the lamest and least funny comedies I have ever seen. Just thinking about it makes me grind my teeth. It's not slapstick, it's not witty, and certainly not intelligent. It's just crude, drunken school-boyish prank-based nonsense that should stay in the minds of drunken schoolboys. Shame on all who took part.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The movie is extremely funny with everyone at their best particularly Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen, but the film is also very sweet and the main duos friendships is one of my favorites since it is clearly a strong bond but still has its struggles without overdoing the drama. It also is the only film I have seen that truly understands the complexities of teenagers. All in all a truly amazing film.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
