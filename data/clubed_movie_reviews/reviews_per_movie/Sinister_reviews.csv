Scariest Movie Iv'e Seen,"This film is probably the scariest film I have ever seen. It bring everything that a good horror film should bring to the table. Jump scares, disturbing imagery, haunting music, etc. The use of the recorded murders is especially terrifying. The story never has a dull moment and provides many good twists along the way. The lack of music during the filmed murders is especially chilling. Ethan Hawke stands out as the protagonist and plays the role very well. The film is not perfect though. There are a few scenes that can come off as silly but still add to the progression of the story. I highly recommend this film and hope you enjoy as much as I did. I recommend watching it with friends and good luck sleeping.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Sinister is very scary! I can't sleep now!,"Turn of your lights. Turn up your volume. Close all your curtains. And enjoy that you can't sleep that night. Sinister is a great movie. Take a blanket and when it is scary put it over your eyes :-) I don't want to tell anything about this horror movie because anything you tell will spoil the fun, you should not know anything about the story in advance I think to keep the excitement 100%. I have read some reviews and I have to say it contains too much information however they don't contain spoilers I would suggest not to read them :-) The acting was great and I really loved the horror scenes, they were amazing.

Cringe,"Another supernatural mess that had the potential to be a good murder mystery type movie, only to devolve into cliche and predictable jumpscares. For goodness sake, the kids in the movie don't even look dead they just look like they're wearing halloween makeup.And to top the cliche pie, they make this gesture with their mouth and finger like ""shush"", but it just comes off trying way too hard to be scary and instead looks stupid.Guess I should've known better than to get my recommendations from mainstream media.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"It's a decent movie, but it's Impossible to love.","Controversial crime writer Ellison Oswalt is willing to put his family life on the line when he begins researching his next book, several deaths that occured at their new home.A very well made, very well acted, with a good storyline, Sinister is a quality production. If I'm honest, I find it a little frustrating, I love the opening sequences, and the elderly premise of the movie, the idea of that serial killer still out there is great. What I didn't care for, was the ending, once it switches into supernatural mode, it isn't as good.I w always thought there are too many cutaway scenes, too much filler, which pads the movie out unnecessarily, but there are plenty of jump scares, plenty of scenes to keep you entertained.Ethan Hawke is fantastic, there's nothing more I can say, and dare I say it, his acting skills probably elevate the film somewhat.It's definitely a decent movie, it should have been a classic.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Sinister- See It In Cinema,"DON'T WATCH THE TRAILER! or at least try not too. I went into this film only knowing the title and the fact i was waiting for a scary movie to actually be... yep scary. Well i was in luck, as Sinister is exactly that...quite Sinister! I say try to avoid the trailers if u can because quite a lot is shown, although having said that you will probably be so absorbed into the film that you'll forget about what you have seen and still be spooked, BOO! :)All the actors do a good job, Ethan Hawke is solid, not quite sure about the chemistry between him and his wife but i guess its hardly relevant in this film. The directing and editing of the film is slick with interesting angles and shots. The imagery is great and so are your jumpy moments even if it does contain a few of the horror Clichés.The plot is simple and follows true-crime writer Ellison (Ethan Hawke) as he discovers a box of home movies ""found footage"" of murders that put his family in danger. Some people may dislike the believability of the films central ethos for the evil protagonist; however i liked the original mythology created here, it adds something new to the table. Also If the film is successful (im guessing it might be) the Evil Character aka Bagoul will no doubt be a new item for Halloween stores! Although not a game changer in the genre, i would easily go and say this will be the scariest film of the year and if not, well thats just win-win for us all!!

Dark and Spooky,"Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) is a true crime writer that was successful in his debut with the book ""Blood in Kentucky"", but also has failed on his next works. He moves with his wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance), his son Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario) and his daughter Ashley (Clare Foley) to a house in King Count that belonged to the Stevenson family expecting to write a best-seller. Ellison does not tell to Tracy that the place was a crime-scene, where four members of the Stevenson family were hanged on the backyard and the girl Stephanie had gone missing.Ellison begins his research about the murder and soon he finds a box with super 8 home videos in the attic.

He befriends the local Deputy (James Ransone), who is his fan, and gets additional information about the cases. He also sees a creepy man in the footages and symbols painted on the wall. He contacts the specialist Professor Jonas that tells him about the cult to the legendary Bughuul. Meanwhile, Ellison and his family are frightened by spooky events in the house.

The plot is developed in slow pace but I startled many times with the weird situations. This is the first time that I see Ethan Hawke working in this genre and he has a convincing performance.

brings the horror back into horror,"One of the scariest horror movies I have seen in a long time. I put off watching this one for a quite a while because when I first started it I noticed it had dim lighting which is a pet peeve of mine. Once I decided to watch it at a later date however, I realized that the cinematographer actually made very effective use of light/dark contrasts, highlighting what we need to see and using the dark spaces to create a cloistering atmosphere of dread and claustrophobia. The performances are also very good, especially the lead, although I feel as though they could have given us more background on the rest of the family. Also the ending isn't what I expected at all and I feel there could have been more action but it did fit in with the rest of this movie which can be quite slow at times, but you hardly notice because of the way this film draws you into it's world. The super 8 sequences were terrifying, they had me on the edge of my seat. In my opinion Sinister is probably one of the best horror films of this decade.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Well made but, a strong sense of ""been there, done that.""","""Sinister"" is yet another horror flick that is well made but, is just too familiar to really be effective. The story opens as a true crime author (Ethan Hawke) moves his family into a house where a multiple homicide was committed (always a bad move) that is the subject of his new novel. But, a box of old home movies mysteriously shows up containing footage of numerous murders and before you can say ""The Ring"" a pagan boogie man know as Buhguul is haunting the footage and his life. Scott Derrickson does create some nice atmosphere and there are some genuinely spooky scenes and well executed jump scares but, he and C. Robert Cargill's script is far too reminiscent of films like ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"" to establish it's own identity and really scare us. You pretty much know what is coming and it's no shock when the film finally gets there. As usual, Hawke's Ellison makes all the right stupid decisions to set the story in motion and continues to do so to keep it headed toward it's predicable conclusion. And I can forgive stupidity in a horror flick if at least it delivers the goods and ""Sinister"" only does really gives us some good chills in the last third but, then arrives at a routine conclusion for this kind of flick that we see coming a mile away. It also doesn't help that so little is known about this Buhguul entity that we never really get a good grasp of it's character and therefor don't really get a good sense of menace. He's just another generic boogie man hiding in pictures and movie footage like the long haired girl ghosts of Asian horror, but, without the personality. The cast all perform well. Hawke is good despite the familiarity of the material and Juliet Rylance does her job as the wife concerned over her husbands behavior, although James Ransone's deputy is one stop away from Deputy Dewey from ""Scream"" . The film does have a slow burn and ultimately could have used a few minutes taken out to move things a long better as there is some repetition with some of the scenes' events (the projector starting on it's own). And the film might have been a bit more effective had the spooky scenes come closer together. All in all SInister is worth a rental, it's not bad, just far too much of what we have seen far too many times before to make it anything more then a forgettable diversion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Clever and chilling,"When I watched this movie I had few expectations about it, but I ended up being satisfied with what I saw. The story revolves around a true-crime writer who, inadvertently, stumbles on a bunch of old movies with macabre scenes of murder. But if you're expecting gore and litres of blood, forget it. What is more frightening in the film is precisely what the cameras don't show but know how to suggest. The crime scenes are truly remarkable, and they were done cleverly in a long-disused (Super 8) video film that was cleverly honoured. The film is getting more and more intense, as events occur that reveal the true nature of the killer. The ending is at least unexpected. The soundtrack accompanies every moment with great discretion, managing to avoid imposing itself on the action of the film. Scott Derrickson, the director / writer, deserves the laurels, as does Ethan Hawke, who brings the lead actor to life.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Unpleasant and tense Ringu ripoff,"This ghostly drama about power of images and children killers was a big commercial success. It skillfully builds atmosphere, jams a few jump scares and non sequiturs, but overall it almost makes sense.

Overall, a decent scary supernatural film, somewhat based in reality, but on closer inspection, more kitschy than artsy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""Sinister""- A solid and satisfying creep-show despite a clunky third act.","Say what you will about the varying quality of their releases- popular horror film production company Blumhouse really has a good thing going these days. With micro-budget features like the ""Insidious"" and ""Paranormal Activity"" series that are reliant on genuine scares over effects, and some very decent and high-quality releases under their name, its a modern day rags-to-riches story like few others. A company that has flourished without having to spend the hundreds of millions that bigger studios throw around. And one of their more fascinating releases of the past few years has most certainly been director Scott Derrickson and co-writer C. Robert Cargill's atmospheric and unsettling freak-show ""Sinister."" It has all the trademarks of an inferior film- plenty of jumps, lots of blood-'n-gore that is questionable, a blaring soundtrack. And yet, I feel it rises above many other films because of one thing- expert building and payoff of atmosphere.We follow the story of true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke), who moves his family into a new house... though his wife and children are unaware that their new home is also the location of an infamous unsolved murder, which Ellison is hoping to use as the basis for a new book. Soon enough, while doing research, Ellison discovers a mysterious box packed away in the attic that houses a collection of 8mm film strips appearing to depict almost ritualistic murders, all with one thing in common- the death of an entire family. As Ellison tries to solve the mystery of these dark and devious film-strips, his family soon finds itself haunted by strange happenings and unexplainable events... which may very well be tied the spirits of the slain victims and a demonic figure that Ellison begins to recognize as he continually appears again and again during his investigation...A great deal of why the film works lays in the capable hands of the creative minds behind it. While I have taken issue with some of director Derrickson's films in the past (including the woefully misjudged ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" remake), I've very much admired his work in the field of horror, in addition to his recent return to the mainstream with the delightful ""Doctor Strange."" And despite a limited budget, he shines through with wicked visual direction and a wonderfully disturbing sense of dread in ""Sinister."" This is one eerie, unsettling film, and his keen use of darkness, composition and suggestive camera angles lends a lot of fear to the proceedings. You can feel the tension growing with each and every passing moment, and at any time, you feel like everything is going to fall apart. I also very much admired how he handled the many ""snuff films"" we see peppered throughout the runtime... they are deliciously evil and twisted in all the right ways to give you the best of goosebumps.The story Derrickson and Cargill craft is just a blast and a half, with extremely likable characters (archetypal though they may be) and a good structure that builds at a gradual but consistent pace. It's a very well-written film for the most part, and it does its job wonderfully in setting up the insanity to follow. Combine that with top-notch performances, and you got the recipe for a great little horror film. Ethan Hawke is absolutely marvelous as always, and it's nice to see him doing just a fun, old-fashioned horror flick. Supporting roles by the likes of Juliet Rylance, James Ransone and Clare Foley are also extremely well-played. And hey... we even get a small, uncredited turn from the fantastic Vincent D'Onofrio as a professor who repeatedly works alongside Oswalt via Skype chat. It's a small role, but it's also a lot of fun.That being said... Oh, boy is there one glaring issue that does drag the film down quite a bit, and it's where it loses some major points for me. And that is the third act. While I will not spoil anything, be prepared for a bit of a let-down with a final reel that feels hastily patched together and has a fair share of moments that stink of studio interference. The first hour is so well assembled, that it's actually pretty mind-blowing how much of a mess the final thirty or so minutes are. With a rash of mind-numbing moments, repeated sloppy exposition dumps and a final sequence that is more likely to illicit unintentional giggles than genuine shocks... it doesn't go out with a bang so much as a whimper.Still, it's not enough to ruin the film. Because outside of that messy, clunky finale, the rest of the film is incredibly strong and it is still a tale well-worth checking out. It's absolutely awe- inspiring sense of primal fear, wonderful performances and wicked entertainment value make it a great go-to for Halloween-night viewings or checking out with a big group of friends in the dark. It's not a perfect film. But it's a very solid and scary experience that I completely recommend to all fans of horror.I give ""Sinister"" a very good 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the Strongest Horror Films In Years,"Sinister (2012)*** 1/2 (out of 4)True-crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) moves his wife and two young children into a home where four people were murdered years earlier. A young girl also went missing so the writer digs in to try and solve the case but before long he finds some 8mm footage that shows other horrendous death scenes. SINISTER certainly lives up to its title as this here is one of the most disturbing horror films to come across in a very long time. I think what makes the film work so well is that it doesn't fall into many horror trappings, which is either a bunch of loud noises to try and scare you or going for a gory, exploitation style filmmaking. SINSITER does the opposite as it really tells a wonderful mystery story and just slowly builds up all the evil and this leads to an incredibly chilling finale. The mystery of the 8mm footage is something that is so perfectly written that you can't help get caught up in everything going on and you're completely glued to the film trying to find the next clue so that the killings can be solved. The screenplay also makes a right decision in letting us really get to know the writing, his personal problems and the issues that he's having with the family. The more you can connect with this writer and his family the more you begin to care for them and want to see them survive this entire ordeal. Director Scott Derrickson really does a remarkable job at slowly building up the tension but he also manages to make for a very dark and sinister atmosphere. The 8mm footage is beautifully shot and it's quit haunting as is the sound of the projector each time it comes on. I'm not going to ruin the ending but kudos to him for having the guts to end it the way he did. Hawke turns in an incredibly strong performance as you believe every aspect of what his character is going through. It helps to have such a strong actor and especially as the film moves along and the tension starts to wear on the character. Juliet Rylance is good as the wife and we get strong support from James Ransone and Fred Dalton Thompson. The film doesn't resort to gory violence or cheap scares but instead it really builds up a feeling of true evilness and by the end of the picture you're really going to be wrap up in the terror going on and everything that's about to happen to conclude the picture.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Best Horror Film in the Last Decade,"Ellison, played by Ethan Hawke, is a true crime novelist who is looking to publish a bestseller more than ten years after the release of his hit book, ""Kentucky Blood"". Ellison moves his family (a wife and two young kids) into a house that was the scene of a grisly crime, leaving a mother, father, and two children dead, and a third child missing. Upon moving in, Ellison finds a box of super 8 films in the attic. On the tapes are the murders of the family who previously lived in his house and four other murders dating back to 1966. The only connection between the murders is a symbol found in all the videos. With his marriage deteriorating and his children's behavior becoming increasingly strange, Ellison is determined to connect the dots and possibly even solve the string of gruesome murders.I'm sure everyone is familiar with the popular 'scary maze game'. Even if you know what is going to happen, you will most likely be scared in the moments leading up to the 'big scare'. You aren't scared of what is on the screen, but you're scared of what is about to be on the screen. That is the difference between surprise and horror. If the moments leading up to a jump scare are suspenseful, the actual scare is considered 'earned'. Too many horror movies nowadays have unearned jump scares. 'Sinister' is not at all one of those movies. It has it's fair share of jump scares, but after the initial shock, you don't feel at all relieved. The scares stick with you and you will go back to being just as tense as you were before the scare.Another way 'Sinister' differs from most modern horror movies is that it actually focuses on plot. The film's director Scott Derrickson spends just as much time focusing on plot development as he does on scaring us, much like he did with 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose'. Since the characters are more developed and have more depth, we are able to relate to them much easier. 'Sinister' is more of a drama about family than it is a horror movie.Ethan Hawke gives one of the best performances I've ever seen in a horror movie. He is great through the entire movie, but especially shines in scenes where he is frustrated. Juliet Rylance who plays his equally as frustrated wife is also great. With great performances from the two leads, it almost doesn't matter how well-acted the characters of their children are, but they are great nonetheless. Michael Hall D'Addario who plays Trevor provides one of the most shocking and terrifying scares I've ever seen (I just wish it wasn't in the trailer. However, if it wasn't, I may have peed).I was lucky enough to see this movie in advance and attend a Q&A session with the director and writer. In the Q&A, they mentioned how this is a new take on the 'found footage' genre. This time however, instead of an ""anonymous source"" finding the footage and ""editing"" it from 36 hours to 80 minutes, the main character is the one who finds the footage. The audience is shown the footage, but not all at once. It is split up perfectly. Every time you hear the projector power up, you will automatically begin looking through the tiny slits between your fingers and you will certainly hold your breath.'Sinister' is disturbing. 'Sinister' is 'Saw' level disturbing. During some scenes, I was actually trembling. The ending is also extremely messed up and surprising. And messed up. Not to mention messed up. The shocking imagery and twisted murders with certainly stick with you. Luckily you won't have any nightmares about the movie, but that's only because you won't be sleeping at all.'Sinister' is the scariest horror movie in years and the best overall in the last decade. Horror fans will flock to see this movie and will not be disappointed. It is well-acted, well- written, well-directed, and most importantly, terrifying. If you see only one horror movie the rest of the year, let this be it. It is near-perfect and a step in the right direction for horror movies.bobbysmoviereviews.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Strange how a film can surprise!,"Sinister follows the character of Ellison (Ethan Hawke), a true-crime novelist who purchases a new home with the hopes of writing a successful book. After moving into his new home, he discovers a box of old home movies that depict previous families who lived in the house, as well as their murders. As Ellison looks further into the mystery behind the tapes, he discovers that the murders all have ties to a supernatural entity known only as ""Bagul"". Bagul exists in images of himself and runs the risk of making Ellison's family the latest casualty of the house.Director Scott Derrickson cleverly used a variety of different camera angles on several key occasions in the film to express the fear and shock of the victims, and the use of sound to depict this was done in a horrifying way. As in many films, actors were used to portray the characters. Ethan Hawke, Juliet Rylance and Clare Foley acted out the most prominent characters in the film. The camera was operated by George Bianchini, in his usual unpredictable manner. Overall I thought the film will pretty much do what it wants to do: make plenty of money. And if people get entertained in the mean time, all the power to them.

A good creepy horror flic.,"If you're in the market for an unsettling, atmospheric horror film that plays mind games rather than opting for cheap gore, ""Sinister"" should be your go-to pick. The film offers a perfect blend of palpable tension and disturbing imagery, all wrapped up in a story that is as immersive as it is creepy.Ethan Hawke delivers a riveting performance as a crime writer who dives headlong into his latest project, investigating a series of true crimes. He relocates his family to a home where a series of grim murders have occurred, adding a layer of haunting realism to his research. As if this wasn't questionable enough, he discovers a box of old Super 8 footage in the attic that exposes him to deeply disturbing scenes that one can only describe as 'sinister.'Juliet Rylance is equally compelling as his wife, embodying the emotional turmoil and apprehension of someone dragged into an unimaginable situation. Both Hawke and Rylance give superb performances that elevate the film above your average horror flick, offering a psychological depth that's hard to shake off.Despite some pacing issues that make the film drag in certain parts, these slower moments are clearly designed to build tension. And build tension they do, preparing the viewer for moments that are genuinely jolting. ""Sinister"" made me jump out of my seat more times than I'd like to admit, which is a testament to its effective storytelling and its ability to engage the viewer's most primal fears.The film's crowning achievement is its emphasis on crafting a powerful narrative and haunting cinematography over gratuitous violence and gore. The suspense is skillfully built through expertly framed shots and an unsettling score, which means that when the scares come, they hit hard and they hit deep.In conclusion, ""Sinister"" is an exemplary low-budget horror film that relies on strong performances, a well-crafted script, and chilling cinematography to deliver its scares.

Hats off to the decade;s scariest movie with some mistakes,I was fortunate enough to see the prescreening of this movie and I have to underline the intensity of the pure horror in it.I actually was skeptical to see this movie due to the overrated trailer. Honestly the trailer is giving just a tad bit of what the movie is all about. I will do my best not to spoil this movie in my review. I trembled throughout the movie with the plot and cinematography used to pull of this movie. The character and the plot development have been elaborately handled and nothing has been blown out of the proportion. Aside from the scene where the kid is getting outside the box everything was scary in it. The idea that crime novelist dad find boxes of murder tapes and his trying to see what those murders are all about and his connecting those scenes to each other in the cinematographic aspect is well done and well maintained. Ethan Hawke's plausibility is a great contribution along with the other cast. I did not see any character who did not fit to the cast at all. Everyone in the movie was very close to the reality which made this movie quite outstanding. The characters are nothing but perfect. Ethan Hawke features a crime novelist who moves in a new house with his family. His finding a box of 8 mm tapes on which gruesome murders took place drags the audience to the depth of the real horror. The camera-work and the quality of the shooting technique build up to the intensity to make this movie scary enough. The gruesome murders on the tapes are split into two parts so nothing is shown at once which makes the audience wait for the second batch of the murders which are quite disturbing. The taped murder scenes are quite disturbing and I totally understand the reason why the rating is quite comprehensive with warnings/ The imagery used in the movie is also very scary and it adds up. The audience understands what is really going on with logical sequence order. I can clearly state that Sinister is the scariest movie among all the movies i have byfar laid eyes on. I would have hard time deciding which one tops when compared to Exorcist of Blattey's. I was pretty pessimistic with the scary movies lately but Sinister has been upto par. If you want to watch a real scary movie and feel the intensity of a real horror movie go see this movie!! There were also some incompetencies throughout. The entire movie cast is around 5 people excluding the killer missing kids with terrible make up. His not letting the Police department know what happened there at the house was off. The deputy's hesitant behavior was very odd and made me feel like he was involved with the murders but he wasn't. The biggest failure of the director was during the interview of the novelist's interview regarding one of his books named Kentucky Blood on TV he said he would prefer not writing any novels if he could find the justice for the murdered ones but a couple sequence later he makes a debate with his wife and tries to convince her that he has to write the book to make more money like making a movie project out of the story he was about to pen. That was a great inconsistency,,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
it really scares,"I like horror movies. They don't scare me much but I love the chilly feeling. Sinister is one of the most scary movies I've ever watched. I got so scared that I had to pause the movie and convinced myself that the scenes are not real several times. I had no idea if the movie is about a real world killer or a paranormal thing and you can't tell it in the first 30 minutes. I believe this part of the movie is the scariest one. In the rest of the movie, the story unfolds and you can predict the ending. So the scare level degrades. Nevertheless Sinister scares you until the ending. It's a good movie with good directing and acting and a mediocre story. I highly recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""Sinister"" successfully reaches out to fans of classic and modern horror","A true crime writer picks the wrong murder mystery for his next book in ""Sinister,"" a horror movie that balances the contemporary horror movie formula with mystery thriller elements and a solid leading performance.Ethan Hawke plays Ellison Oswalt, a successful writer who has just moved his family to a town in Pennsylvania where a family was found hung from a tree in the backyard except for the third child, who was reported missing. Unbeknownst to the rest of his family, Ellison has moved them into the exact house where the family was killed. In the attic, he finds a box with an 8mm film projector and a handful of film reels, all of which show families being murdered, including the case he's investigating. Ellison realizes he's on to something big, but eventually things take a supernatural turn.If the film weren't titled ""Sinister"" (a title that seems to have been subjectively chosen for marketing purposes) and you went in without knowing anything, you might actually convince yourself you were watching an eerie true crime thriller and be a bit surprised to watch the film take a contemporary horror flick turn equipped with creepy ghost children, freaky old movies and a pagan deity.""Sinister"" straddles these two genres without disappointing fans that wanted one over the other, but might disappoint fans that enjoy one but don't like the other at all. Director Scott Derrickson (""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"") uses classic suspense techniques and the creepy Super8 videos for that slow-building dread effect reminiscent of a more classic horror-thriller, while also employing the slow- walking-through-a-house-at-night-that-ends-in-a-jump-scare techniques of today's horror movies. The film predictably begins with more of the former and ends distinctly as the latter, and Derrickson oversees the passing of that baton and ensures it happens cohesively with strong, evocative visuals and an unusually creepy soundtrack.C. Robert Cargill's story also allows these genres to function effectively together. Good horror movies show more interest and concern in the characters and how they deal with horrifying events than the horrifying events themselves. Cargill's script definitely focuses on Ellison, and the simple conceit of him being a writer who investigates murders puts him in a unique position among horror movie protagonists. Cargill adds the twist that Ellison has not had a best-seller in 10 years, so there's pressure on him to pursue this case in spite of the warning signs.A strong lead character also appeals to a better caliber of actor, and Hawke lends so much legitimacy to this movie. Ellison is more accustomed to seeing disturbing things, so to watch Hawke's performance as this case gets more and more under his character's skin is a real added benefit. Hawke allows us to empathize with his character despite knowing full well that we would not have handled things the same way he does at various points in the film.The ending has some issues along those lines and some information that seems obvious to the audience is not obvious to the characters, and that can be frustrating, but on the whole, ""Sinister"" leaves you with a jaw-dropper of an ending, a perfectly freaky culmination of all the classic suspense and minutes upon minutes of wondering when it's all going to blow up.""Sinister"" will more likely win over viewers who don't always like scary movies than it will avid scary movie watchers who love the genre precisely for its conventions and clichés, but it successfully reaches out to both.~Steven CThanks for reading!

not scary at all,"Halloween 2012 I had to chose between a few flick who had their premiere that night. I went for Bait and Possession and Paranormal Activity 4. Sinister I didn't watch back then but waited a few months. Somehow I had a bad feeling with this.And I was right. There was a bit too much of talking going on. And when the ghosts appear it looked a bit laughable too. Although that it had a few nice killings, sadly on 8mm. A true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) comes across some snuff 8mm. Je wants to know the truth behind it but it isn't what it looks, is it a serial killer or a ghost at work.It never scared me or gave me any jump moments. Even when the films over and things are over you could guess what will happen next, never okay if you have that feeling. The acting on the other hand is sublime but there was an overall look that never made it look like a horror. A mainstream horror clearly made not to have a R-rating.

Sinister. A Excellent Horror Film.,"Sinister is very well made horror film. It is the only scary horror film I've seen for a very long time. It's never too cliché as most horror movies are. It never cheats you. The performances are believable and the story is intriguing and always moving. The director has control over his audience, and the audience is completely okay with that. I knew early into the film what kind of horror film it was and I how it would scare me. And that what was one of things it had going for it. You can anticipate the scares and that makes it much more frightening. Do not confuse anticipation with predictability. The movie wasn't too gruesome, which left more room for actual fear. All in all, it is a very good film, So good, it's almost... Sinister...",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Captivating, creepy, atmospheric n an excellent ominous, eerie soundtrack.","I saw this first on a DVD in 2013. Revisited it recently. The movie was a like a breath of fresh air. The soundtrack was awesomely creepy n haunting. This movie had me glued from start to finish. I cud only recognise Ethan hawke from the star cast. Well the plot is basic - a family has moved into the wrong house where the previous tenants were murdered. It is not at all predictable n it is very terrifying. The title, Sinister aptly suits the movie. Captivating and creepy from the opening, it packs in plenty of scares from start to finish while also creating a horrifyingly unsettling atmosphere that engulfs you in same way that it grips the main character. Its a slow burn horror but not at all boring. The movie is full of atmosphere n tension. The creepy tapes, creepy kids, creepy drawings n most of all a very creepy n noteworthy villain, Mr Boogie. Scott Derrickson did a terrific job with the direction. Been a fan of his Exorcism of Emily.... As a pure chair-jumper, its right up there with the best. Derrickson knows how to put effective horror scenes on screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
plain boring,"It's so slow and boring, even skipping 10seconds wise is still annoying because he's just wandering around in the dark with his baseball bat.Maybe a horror movie for a girls pyjama party but if you really like horror movies just skip that one and don't waste your time.

"Decent, but no more than that.","For me it is pretty easy to split up the good and bad here. We have some pretty good acting performances, especially from Ethan Hawke.There is also a good setting for a very creepy story, beginning with the movies found in the house.We have the family drama (seen before, but it is done convincingly and acted out well).We have our funny little sidekick in detective so and so.All in all the potential for something good is there.But then starts the clichés. One after another they just pour in from left and right.If you, like me, have watched horror movies for over 30 years, you will see everything coming before it happens. From the use of sounds/soundtrack to the moments the visuals pop up in your face. And when that is the case, it is just not scary at all to me.And the ending is a letdown as well. It's just unconvincing, uninteresting and leaves you feeling kinda empty.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Superbly scary movie!,"This movie is a must watch for all the horror fanatics. I really did not expect it to be so good and after watching it am totally impressed. The the sound effects are amazing. The movie is so unconventional and different than most horror movies in a way that it makes you wonder if its a true story. Best part is that it makes you think and there are so many scenes wherein you just want to pause the movie because you just cant handle the intense suspense. Its a must watch and you will not regret for even a single moment, all the more a true horror movie fan would get peace of mind for a good deal of time before they would want to watch another spin chilling horror movie.

"Halloween 2023: Despite Its Flaws, It's SO Effective as a Scare Fest","Sinister, released in 2012, to me remains one of the best and most iconic horror films of the Millenium. Is it perfect? No. Sinister is a film with a lot of issues, some major and some minor, but it's a movie I'm happy with watching over and over again. The concept is good and it's so effective as generating tension and scares, that I'm willing to look past a lot of the film's flaws.Let's just get this out of the way: without the video tapes, this movie would be pretty mediocre. It's the brilliant, shocking, frankly, unforgettable home movies that had me (and many others) on the edge of my seat. They're so disturbing, so intriguing, that it's hard not to at least sympathize with Ethan Hawke's character as he can't help himself but turn the projector on every time to see another one.Hawke really does well here and carries the film. We spend a lot of time with the guy and while I think it's fair to say he's not the most ""likeable"" person, I could always understand his motivations.The idea behind Sinister is so well done and is a fantastic murder-mystery in its own right. The ending is devilish and leaves you with a dark pit in your stomach, presenting a villain so evil, cruel, and well, sinister, that it doesn't matter if he kind of looks like WWE's Sting and the CG around him is kinda goofy.I mean, if I had to complain about something, the first thing would be the shoddy CG and make up, as well as the lackluster set design. I would've liked a house that's more memorable, to be honest, and the way the movie looks feel a bit banal for what's going on. There's also some cheesy line delivery and some of the other supporting characters are extremely trope-y, so it's not perfect. But, Sinister still stands the test of time for me as a enduringly creepy, unsettling horror film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Delightful Horror Treat!,"When the trailer boasted the producers of ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""Insidious"" the idea of what tone this film would be reared it's head. Based around a series of jump scare sequences and slow character sections in order to attempt to make you feel for the characters while easing the tension of the situation. It's a tired formula that is becoming all the more clichéd and repetitive. However Sinister manages to find ways to break free of these leashes that the horror genre is becoming tied down to.Ethan Hawk stars as a true crime writer known as Ellison who moves into a new home with his wife, Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and his two children, Ashley (Clare Foley) and Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario) near the site of a local crime in order to get inspiration for his novel. During an exploration of the house Ellison stumbles across a box with an 8mm camera and a selection of films, which upon viewing exploit gruesome murders. This thrusts area hero into a terrifying mystery as he tries to piece together the meaning behind it all.With horror films these days we come to know what to expect. We're given characters that we can't connect with merely there to service the plot and an un-original story that we've seen time and time again bringing the audience no sense of engagement. But mostly we're never scared beyond the mere technique of a jump scare. With director Scott Derrickson we are shown again how mainstream horror can creep on us with effective imagery and suggestion. The scares here can be portrayed by just using obscure camera angles and bizarre images that unsettle us. Derrickson understands though that using loud bands and noises to jolt the audience can be done effectively. By backing up these moments with his strong imagery he uses it as a tactic to implant these horrific moments in our minds.The highlight however is the use of the 8mm films. Sinister is in love with the idea of film, from celluloid to digital as not only are we treated to disturbing super 8 films but Ellison boasts are large collection of VHS tapes of his old achievements. It's a nice, simple touch that film fans will appreciate. These 8mm films though boast some truly graphic sequences, one particularly involving a garden tool. Backed with a moody soundtrack by Christopher Young who's worked on other horror gems such as ""Drag Me To Hell"" and ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"". It feels more of an ambiance piece rather than a fully diegetic score merging together a series of dark and effective sounds building the feeling of dread constantly throughout.Written by Derrickson himself and writer C. Robert Cargill the screenplay manages for the most part to push past the bland formula we've grown to endure with horror films of late. The film brings an intriguing plot that manages to put you in the position of Ellison's character, uncovering the plot and mystery when he does. There are scenes in which are hero re-visits the 8mm films and discovers new elements to them which adds a new depth to the story. The film feels relentless, rarely taking time to slow down and constantly feeling as though it's propelling towards something. However elements of the script are where the weaker parts of the film shine. While managing to bring interesting uses of horror and tension the film often retreads over clichéd ground as though it's trying to keep a warm attitude towards mainstream audiences. These are the times when the film feels as though it may lose focus but always manages to pick up its feet again. Alongside this we have some underused side and poorly written characters such as a police deputy who doesn't feel natural within the whole scale of things.Sinister may tread over worn ground by it still manages to feel fresh and revitalizing in an age where we've conformed to the degrading standards of horror. It embraces the roots of horror and film in general making it much more than a homage and a feeling of an original yet genuinely terrifying story. Hawk manages to carry the emotional tangent of the narrative while the other characters are merely serviceable. It's not groundbreaking but for a mainstream horror film it takes some inventive and daring steps creating a terrifying, disturbing yet absorbing piece of cinema.4/5 Stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Now here's a horror movie,"This one scared the hell out of me. With the eerie music to accompany the film it sure made the movie creepy as hell. The opening sequence felt so real that it got me hooked to know just what the hell is going on.I was watching it alone on Friday night after work and sure enough there were about less than 10 people in the theater (all of whom were couples). I could bet with my bottom dollar that with this movie they'd be so engaged in the film that they wouldn't dare to think about making out.It is THAT SCARY!!!The film was directed by Scott Derrickson, the same guy who made THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE; and he collaborated with the composer, Christopher Young, on that very film. I am quite familiar with Young's music score from his composition for A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2 and it was creepy; also he did the score for Sigourney Weaver's serial killer film, COPYCAT.I'm telling you if those two managed to bring out the spine-chilling factor in EMILY ROSE, in SINISTER they really sealed the deal in being the potent filmmakers in the exploration into the paranormal and supernatural. It gave me goosebumps just thinking about it.One thing that I feel about SINISTER was that Derrickson (together with Young) brought us back to that atmospheric terror of the unknown that is truly nostalgic of horror films of the 70s.The feel of the movie was so scary that this was how THE AMITYVILLE HORROR should have been remade.In short, I'd highly recommend you (or better still DARE YOU) to see SINISTER. This is one good date movie if you want your date to crawl under your shirt; or just bring some best buddies to scare the crap out of you.

Scary in parts but I expected scarier. This is more of a psychological then Saw like horror. Comparable to the Shining. I say B-,"""Do you understand what you've done this time?

Wanting to be as accurate as possible he moves him and his family into a house where the crime took place.

I will start be letting you know what kind of movies scare me. To me Poltergeist is the scariest movie but I also watched it when I was like 8. Recently the Exorcism of Emily Rose and Insidious really scared me. I say that to tell you that this movie didn't really scare me like I expected. The movie is more psychological then horror but it does have some definite scary parts to it. I'm not sure what I was expecting but I was thinking it was going to be scarier then it was.

Esentially the Perfect Horror Film,"Sinister may just be one of the greatest films in the entire genre of horror in my opinion. Not only is this scientifically considered one of the scariest horror films of all time but it does it in a brilliant way. This film scares you with minimal to no gore, it is just outright disturbing. There are a few jumpscares but they are exceptionally crafted and don't feel cheap. This film follows a man who was a successful true crime writer. In seeking new success he moves him and his family to the home where murders took place. He discovers horrific snuff films in the attic. We watch a man discover horrific things about these films and see the horror from his perspective. These tapes are not gruesome or gory as I stated, they are just so evil and ""sinister"", as they have a realistic feel to them. The directing and acting is second to none in this film as well. The performances were believable and that one of the things that make this movie so scary. Another reason as to why this film is so terrifying is the unsettling audio that plays throughout the film. The combination of disturbing imagery and unsettling audio make you very uncomfortable while watching. This feels like a real story and is so far from a lot of the cheap horror out there. Absolutely amazing and in my mind what a perfect horror film looks like.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Another ghost story that rises before it falls,"People going to see Sinister are most likely doing so because they are fans of the genre, and have likely seen dozens of such films. Sinister's greatest trick is that for a while, it convinces you that you have NOT seen this kind of movie before. It will have you hooked from the first shot, and for about an hour, Sinister is just as suspenseful as it is intriguing. Unfortunately, like so many movies do, the final act falls short.Sinister runs out of steam in the last half hour. The ending is a problem, for not only does it come with a sense of anti-climax, but it is almost absurd enough to pass for genre parody. It leaves behind an abundance of red herrings, and you come away feeling a little bit cheated.Another problem with Sinister is that it sweeps two or three potentially interesting sub-plots under the rug; something that would have given the movie more interesting characters. There is a sense that too much story material was left behind in order to make this a more direct and unfaltering ghost story.Perhaps more than any other genre, horror movies demand very manipulative interior cinematography, and Sinister doesn't seem like it was lit properly. Even for a horror movie, the shadows are surprising heavy and overwhelming, and there are moments when it is too dark to see anything. This is not a complaint I make frequently about movies. More impressive in Sinister, is the sound design. which is full of subtle contributions. I cannot remember the last time I was spooked by the sound of a film projector's motor and claw.I wish I could recommend Sinister, but I cannot. Even if it is a scary movie, it is one that initially appears to be smarter and more original than it actually is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The only one of two movies that scared the hell out of me.,"The last time a horror movie scared me to death was when I was a kid, when I watched the original Exorcist movie starring Linda Blair. Since then, I watched a lot of horror movies and eventually became a horror movie fan of both supernatural and slasher horror movies. Though there were several scary ones, there was none that is as scary and creepy as the Exorcist until I watched Sinister.Sinister is a movie that combined elements of eeriness, creepiness, and classical theme that turned it into a horror masterpiece. The killing process for example where the family is hanged to a tree is a very classic murderous encounter, and as the man watches that video in the dark, that itself is very eerie as much as it is creepy and scary. You, as an audience can feel the atmosphere that the man is in. So not only are you moved by the vibe of the movie, you also feel the events that are happening. Another aspect that made this movie an excellent horror film is the involvement of the children in the horror events. You will definitely wonder how and why, why the children. And that leads you to investigate as a viewer, to dig deeper into the aspect of this movie. That is what makes this movie really scary. One's curiosity in trying to dig deeper into the events of the movie, just like the main character, leads you into an unknown evil dimension where you don't know what lies ahead. Just the pure thought of it scares you as an audience because you also experience what the character is experiencing.The cinematography is perfect. The acting is great. Ethan Hawke delivered a memorable performance as the curious writer who was lured into an evil dimension he wasn't even aware of. Overall, Sinister is an excellent horror movie experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Great atmosphere, too much bad cgi...","My mother taught me that looking great is important, but to seduce one should leave a little to the imagination. Scott Derrickson could learn a little something from my mother.I will admit, the film is really, really creepy! What makes the movie horrifically entertaining is its atmosphere and sound effects/ambient score. The 8mm scenes are brilliant and are what give the movie style. The director is on the top of his game when he uses shadows and out-of-focus images of horrors I won't mention at the risk of spoiling the film . The story is also interesting, albeit reminiscent of Paranormal activity 3 and about a dozen other films I've seen. However, all of those strengths are deflated the moment the movie crew starts using second-rate CGI for extended periods of time, in clear focus. His creatures are only scary when we can't see them clearly.. when they're popping in and out of the shadows, hidden in the blurry images of photos, or when we see their reflection in a bit of something here or there. Casting monstrous villains in a bright spotlight strips them of their mystery, their creepiness, and their horror. Also, the longer we have to look at the creatures, the more obvious the film's budget.The characters and dialogues were mostly stale, with few exceptions. I was rather bored with the stamp-like story completely revolving around a white guy and his pride, who is the master of the house and who makes all of the decisions for the family despite his wife's intuitive pleas and half- hearted ultimatums. Like that story hasn't been told before. How about some new family dynamics that aren't a throwback to the 50's and 60's? Also, some of the main character's reactions to different scenarios weren't entirely believable.So: good job overall, but needs work on excessive, unnecessary use of bad cgi, and, well, a better writing/editing team, particularly with regards to character development.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Surprisingly good horror,"I went into this film knowing very little. The little description I had was that it was about a true-crime writer who, while investigating a family murder for his new book, finds a bunch of old homemade movies pointing at a bigger, serial-killer like plot. I expected another of the infamous 'lost footage' films, with the whole movie being just the homemade films (ie.: something akin to 'Cannibal Holocaust').I was wrong. Pleasantly wrong.'Sinister' is quite tense and moody, sometimes a bit too dark (I'm talking about the light here too, not just the mood), and with enough scary moments to make it work well. The plot is good and even intelligent, with the story tying up nicely any loose ends and transitioning from a seemingly 'serial-killer plot' to a supernatural horror very well; it's also without much nonsense, creating the horror feeling well without having to drag on. The cast (Ethan Hawke being the only one I recognize) is okay, but the movie doesn't really require much of them.The movie is not without its faults, though. There is something akin to a 'plot twist', but one that introduces an element that has been used too much in recent horror (see: Ringu, Kairo, their American remakes and rip-offs) to be considered original; very predictable, even. There is a fair share of clichés, from the characters downgraded intellect in key or even common situations (when the police officer comes to the house for the first time, for example), to cheap scare scenes that serve no other purpose (the many times Hawke walks through his house in the dark of the night).All in all, a good horror movie. Not going to be a classic, but stands out among the horde of crappy/idiotic horrors from the past few years, and should give anyone watching a good time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Lights!,"I wanted to like Sinister more than I did. It definitely works better as murder mystery / thriller. It wasn't scary and the trailer spoiled most of the jump scares. The ending was anti-climatic and left me unsatisfied. My biggest gripe though, the lights. Ellison starts off with lights in his office. He tosses the Home Movies box On a table and slaps pictures up on a board. A handful of lights illuminating his office. From then on, as the film progresses and the creepiness too, he makes a conscious Choice never to turn a light on. I understand the purpose from an atmospheric stance, but it felt unrealistic and too purposeful. Throw a light on here or there. It would be more realistic and still provide pockets of blackness in the background for something creepy to pop out. Even though nothing ever does.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Ethan Hawke solid in tense horror,"Ethan Hawke is crime writer Ellison Oswalt. It's been 10 years since his breakout hit.

Strange things keep happening in the house. For example, he finds some 8mm snuff films in the attic, and discover there may be other related murders.Ethan Hawke is rock solid in driving this movie. This is all his movie. The atmosphere is amazing. If there's anything they desperately needed, it's some better supporting characters.

Grown men screaming in the theatre!,"I saw this last night at the theatre. It's the scariest, most tense horror film I have seen on the big screen since I saw Candyman 20 years ago and it's probably the scariest film I have seen since I saw The Ring, on DVD, about 10 years ago.Sinister's clever use of sound and its creepy music score, a-la Candyman, is its biggest asset. I say an Oscar is deserved for Christopher Young who has outdone himself with sublime arrangements which bring depth and real terror alongside the visuals.By instilling fear from the outset and implying a dreadful fate to the protagonist (which the viewer is hoping can be avoided but ultimately knows is lurking at the end), Sinister takes its influence from The Ring and keeps the tension building throughout the movie. It becomes almost unbearable in places! Whilst it doesn't really avoid the standard horror clichés of the last decade, Sinister manages to retain just enough credibility to keep the fear simmering in the audience.The film is not without its flaws though. You might find yourself shaking your head on the odd occasion and the story, whilst decent and played out with good tempo, treads the fine line between supernatural and reality and, in my opinion, gets it slightly wrong but it's not really enough to spoil the result.My adrenaline levels, after watching this, kept me from sleeping for another 3 hours, so be warned.

"Overall-Scariest Film I've Seen For  A Long, Long time.","Sinister has a unique and different narrative, much different than the over-used cabin in the woods or fuelled on sexually active teens and pure gore, it consists of a writer, played by Ethan Hawke, he moved his family into a house in which the latest murder took place. He found a box of 'super 8' films and discovered the murders of what happened were all caught on these tapes. As the movie unfolds with somewhat of an enigma to whom or what it could be it grasps the audience in a way to keep them intrigued but to also keep them on the 'edge of their seat'. However it uses traditional key conventions to the horror genre and uses a much more 'calmer' approach and focuses much on the narrative of the film rather than how to scare the audience. It has gone back to the old originals, focusing on music and the build up of tension rather than gore, violence and deaths every 5 minutes.This film would be a key success in my opinion and has the a much better ability to make you jump rather than just make you stare and say 'eww'. This film was a disturbing, but not to the point in which you may wish to stop watching and death, though a key part, was not shown every two scenes. A definite recommendation for me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Sinister warns of watching films you find in the attic,"Over the years horror films have gotten to be a dime a dozen. More often than not they just fail to deliver. With the found footage craze, it added a new depth, but sadly ran its course almost as fast as it became popular. The latest to try it's hand in delivering something new to the genre is Sinister, that while it's not a found footage film, does use some of the technique to tell what looks to be a somewhat unique tale.Sinister follows a crime novelist and his family as they move into a new home for him to work on his latest true-crime novel. The closer he comes to the truth, the more he realizes he might have put his family in the path of pure evil. This film definitely delivers on not only the story it wants to tell, but in the creepy nature it sets out to achieve. The use of the old school films to tell the story adds a new dimension that really stepped this film up. Ethan Hawke did an awesome job with his character and delivering the obsessive nature needed to bring this part to life. The film takes its time to build up the strange disturbed story that is needed, but is also where the film has a minor issue. There are some aspects to the story that are just not needed and really seep in from time to time and end up slowing things down causing it to lose some of the momentum its building. Thankfully that is the only issue with this movie. It really delivers a unique addition to the horror genre with a new creature/character that could easily be brought back from time to time if done correctly. There isn't a lot of blood here, but there is a lot of moments that showcase the fills to come, while really sticking images in your brain that affect you without ever seeing them.This is a great addition to the genre, but one that will no doubt be met with mixed feelings due to its sometime slow nature. Despite the sometimes slow pace this is a cleverly creepy horror film that is sure to be a refreshing taste for those fans of the genre.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
What happened to the horror?,"Oh dear God, this movie was such a horrible disappointment. The trailer looked interesting and the story sounded alright, but the movie itself was just far from scary and actually turned out to be somewhat of a joke.Sure it was better than the recent crap that has flooded the horror genre, such as the ""Paranormal Activity"" series, but then again, it doesn't take much from a movie to do that.What made ""Sinister"" bearable to watch was the acting performances. Normally I am not much of a fan of Ethan Hawke, but he actually did a good job in this movie. And the movie does have some great moments where it builds up some suspense, just a shame that it never really climaxed into anything particularly worthwhile. And also the cinematography in the movie made the movie bearable to suffer through. A lot of good camera work and great angles, but ultimately it was all struggling to best a horrible storyline and a lack of scares.The story does start out nice and does have a certain appeal, but it all takes a turn for the worse when you are let in on what is actually going on, and when you see the dead children in the house for the first time it all goes downhill fast.I had expected ""Sinister"" to be a lot more than it turned out to be. I wasn't particularly spooked or thrilled at any given moment throughout the entire feature. There were some good moments, but they never really culminated into anything grand. And the story took a severe turn for the worse and ridiculous along the way.If you enjoy a good scary movie, there are far better movies available out there.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Very Scary and disturbing,"Saw Sinister today and loved it. I am a horror fan and it was a great scary movie and disturbing, good disturbing if you know what I mean. Jumped a couple of times and the length of the movie was perfect. have no complaints. I thought Ethan Hawke was perfect for the picture and his wife in the movie (ive never seen) was very great also. From all the way back from the 60s there were murders of the entire family, but one of the kids always came up missing. and each family murdered it was like a 10 year span from each other and they all previously lived in the same house the previous family was murdered in. It all came together in the end, it was a great story and movie. cant wait till it comes out on DVD. Great job!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Sinister!,"I'm new to watching horror movies and I thought I would give this a shot!Well I am utterly creeped out.The incorporation of mythology into the film helped steer it away from normal horror movie clichés.I liked the fact that you had to wait until the very end to know what was actually going on .. I was not able to guess the plot half way through as in most horror movies.The imagery used was scary and I jumped out of my seat a number of times. The music built suspense throughout. The ending has me so freaked out I am too scared to go upstairs to the bathroom!But hey I am a wimp.I did find the film a little long and was willing it to be over towards the end. I can imagine this would be very popular in a cinema setting as it had some very heart-stopping/jumpy moments.I do not recommend watching alone, in a lonely house, at night, on your own. Did I mention I'm all alone?!?!I gave it a 6, the story was clever, but for me personally I was a wreck throughout!",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A tired story that needn't to be remade again,"I have to admit being a little skeptical about a new Hollywood horror that was yet again supposed to be the best horror movie in a long time.Well a family moves into a house where something horrible had taken place in the past. The first thing that came to my mind was that how unoriginal that whole idea was. It's been reused several times before, and not even several, plenty of times to be exact. It's like re-inventing Amityville horror of the 70's with ideas from newer films, such as The Ring and The Grudge and yes there's super 8 film this time, not VHS, that's just the obvious difference. It seems like that it's exact same tired film made again with slightly different setting.Jump scares. Yes, plenty. Frightening sounds. Yes, i'd have been jumping on my seat if i had seen this in a cinema. Visually the film isn't that scary.So what's new this time. Absolutely nothing, even the ending is easily guessed because there we have some expert telling the whole mystery out loud in the middle of the film, 45 minutes in advance. Yes everything is chewed and ready so that the audience wouldn't need to think too much.I'd never liked supernatural elements in a movie and this movie made no difference. In overall it's a very boring film that just seems pointless with plain characters that aren't likable. I didn't care much what'd happen to them. That's a kind of a problem.Technically the film is perfect but is that enough to make a good and enjoyable film if its story is so tired already? I can recommend this film to those who aren't familiar with horror genre in general and its clichés and story lines. For anyone else it's just tiring experience.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Good horror, bad monster","This was a solidly entertaining, slightly above average horror film. The whole premise/plot was engaging and suspenseful with good pacing and decent acting. I thought the main guy did a good job, and the only person who really stuck out to me was some of the choices the deputy made, they felt very strange at times. I also was not super convinced in their marriage.Some of the night scenes started to feel a tad repetitive to me and there were quite a few scenes that were entirely too dark. I would say my biggest problem with it, honestly, was the way Bughuul looked... I just, did not like it at all. It was like a weird cartoony black and white joker/clown...? It felt fully off the mark to me for a pagan god and really took me out of it everytime I saw him.Over all I think they had a really cool/engaging story and generally did a good job with this. Would recommend.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Don't worry, Daddy. I'll make you famous again.","Ethan Hawke is a true crime novelist, for his next book he's investigating the death of a family who killed themselves, only to be survived by a daughter who went missing from the scene of the crime and has remained missing since. In his quest to get as much information as possible he moves his family into the dead family's house. He finds a box in the attic which contains an old 8mm projector with some family movies. As he starts to watch them he realises that the films aren't strictly family movies, they are snuff movies of different families being killed by a mysterious figure. Rather than immediately tell the police he investigates to see if there is any connection between the family he was initially investigating and the families in the movies. Can he uncover the truth, or will he unwittingly get involved in a supernatural murder mystery which has the potential to consume him.This 2012 film is directed by Scott Derrickson, and written by Derrickson and Robert Cargill. This is a horror, mystery, thriller film which touches on crime and supernatural. Ethan Hawke plays Ellison Oswalt, the fictitious crime writer. He's supported by Juliet Rylance who plays his wife Tracy; James Randone plays a local Deputy, with Fred Thompson playing the local Sheriff.This film was more entertaining than I expected it to be. With the vast amount of horror films which have flooded the market and appear on late night cable channels, there aren't that many original stories left to tell. I'm not saying this was absolutely original as it's a ""found footage"" film, but what was different this time around from other similar films, is the depth and substance. There were some visually striking scenes and there was a daunting soundtrack which really added to the tension. There were times where the tension was ramped up that much that it made the film feel disturbing, like hearing nails being slowly scraped down a chalkboard.The supernatural element of the film is primarily brought to life from the ""found footage"", the macabre films that Hawke watches. It unsettles Hawke's character and it's unsettling to the audience too. Yes, the films are staged for the movie, but they feel fairly authentic which just adds to the chills that are felt. The Bughuul character, a deity from Babylonian/ Pagan folklore that eats the souls of children, may not be all that scary himself, but in the context of this movie with the actions that he has been committed to, it really help to make the film as scary as it is.This movie kind of reminded me of ""The 9th Gate"" and ""The Shining"". It's never too cliché, it's very dark at times and it relies on tension rather than, like modern horror, jump scares with lots of splattering of gore, and importantly, it's intelligent too. The film takes inspiration from ""Ring"", which is clearly obvious with the use of technology and urban folklores. There is also an element of ""It"" too with the use of a supernatural clown-type character as the main bad guy.Ethan Hawks is the central focus of the film and he does a fantastic job, his level of delivery makes up for less authentic performances in the film from other actors, particularly his family. Hawke's level of stress increases throughout the film, which he portrays authentically to the point that it's easy to empathise with him. The intelligence of the film means that the audience learns things as Hawke does, and knowledge is drip fed through the film. This means that the end of the film sneaks up on you and the eventual outcome isn't always obvious - which is a refreshing change nowadays.I really enjoyed this film; it's a long time since I've watched a film which was able to keep me on tenterhooks throughout. Another testament to the strength of the film is that it scared my girlfriend a lot - normally that would prompt me to try and make her jump but in this instance I couldn't - she was that scared! This film won't be for everyone, but for die hard horror fans that like good old fashioned horror rather than the typical blood splatter heavy, light on substance, horror that's mainstream today - this will be for you. It's probably one you want to watch when any kids have gone to bed though. 8 out 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Finally, a horror worth seeing","The past few years have not shown anything worth being scared by. The found footage genres, though as clever as they can be, are running dry. Sinister, though, does something different with the found footage genre, as well as horror. This film is a straight forward ride into a disturbing and sadistic story of evil, with some clichéd and creative scares. Ethan Hawke is committed to his role 100 percent as the protagonist trying to find a story that will bring him fame once again. It is his lust for fame that proves to be his and his family's downfall. I truly believe this film will either scare you or indent it's gloomy/frightening imagery into your mind. Spectacular on visuals, creative on scares, and well acted by the leads, Sinister is a great way to start out the Halloween season.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Welcome to the big leagues Blumhouse!,"Sinister (2012) was one of the first major hits from then newcomer movie studio, Blumhouse Productions and now we are here in 2024 with a lot of massive hits and failures from this movie studio. This is one of the few movies from Blumhouse Productions I've rewatched multiple times over the years. It's also worth noting that this was the movie that introduced to Scott Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill. After rewatching this movie for the 15th time, Sinister (2012) is easily among one of the best movies from Blumhouse Productions and one of the best horror movies from the 2010s.Positives for Sinister (2012):
The best thing about this movie are the Super 8 home movies and snuff films. These segments are among some of the most terrifying things I have ever seen in any horror movie. Watching these grizzly murders happening on screen are very unsettling and disturbing. The other element that makes these segments so effective is the sound design which adds another layer of discomfort to the experience. Then, you have the cast of actors in this movie and everyone from Ethan Hawke as Ellison Oswalt, Juliet Rylance as Tracy Oswalt, Fred Thompson as the Sheriff, James Ransone as the Deputy, Michael Hall D'Addario as Trevor Oswalt, Clare Foley as Ashley Oswalt and Vincent D'Onofrio as Professor Jonas are all phenomenal. I can also say the same for Nick King as Bughuul or Mr. Boogie and this guy doesn't ever have a single line of dialogue. For me, it's the look of this horror icon that makes Bughuul so terrifying. There are number of very effective jumpscares in the movie and there is not one that doesn't work. And finally, I appreciated that all of the conversations and dialogue feel real in this movie and not many horror movies can achieve that.Overall, Sinister (2012) is one of the best and scariest horror movies to come out in the 21st Century and I am so happy that this love is starting to gain the credit and respect that it deserves.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
TRULY TERRIFYING & SCARY AS HELL WITH A GREAT ETHAN HAWKE PERFORMANCE,"""SINISTER"" is truly a terrifying experience, especially when i watched it at the Cinema but even since then I've watched it a few times & each viewing is still utterly terrifying lol!! One of the best Horror's in a long time.We get a fantastic performance by Ethan Hawke as a struggling writer who moves his family to a small town & moves into a house where real murders happened & some real sinister things start to happen, he thinks this creepy place will help give him inspiration to write a magnificent book on his true crime story of which happened at the house he's now living in.Hawke as Ellison is excellent here as his descent into utter terror is gripping & disturbing, this is a shocker that drips pure terror & dread in it's Atmosphere, mood & look. Now Ellison isn't the nicest guy to root for because he continues to put his family in danger even when he witnesses so much Sinister activity & in real life you would get your family out & be gone lol but it's a character & a driven one that wants to uncover the Mystery & make a hit book.James Ransone (It: Chapter 2) is great as timid & weary Duputy who is a supporting character but a great one.The movie looks fantastic & the scares are as frightening as can be for a Horror flick, especially a Horror flick about the supernatural!!!Another major thing here that stands out is it's ridiculously terrifying soundtrack, the music score is completely engulfing with it's creepy sounds & almost suffocating noises that make everything feel so claustrophobic & full of dread!!! This Horror movie is crafted to be one to always remember & as a life long Horror movie fan not much still scares me but this film still makes me feel uncomfortable & unsettled after watching it, it's a powerful Horror film & one of the absolute best in a long time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Terrible,"After seeing this I felt I had to review this as it was not what I was expecting at all.Firstly the films lighting. There is a time and place for darkness but in the case of this film even at breakfast the lighting was poor, maybe the budget went elsewhere. Now in a time when directors and producers use their wit and imagination to draw you in throw a few twists and then surprise you at the end as in many horrors these days, this one didn't. It relied on poor old techniques to make people jump for a brief second before spending the next five minutes boring you with predictable behaviours of the characters only to do the same poor old technique to make someone jump again. As I sat in a packed cinema one thing became apparent the need for many to begin their own conversations as obviously they were finding this as predictable as myself. This under the right direction could have been good maybe even very good, but it simply wasn't and I think 3/10 is being quite generous.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Nothing too original, but succeeds in fulfilling the premise of a clever ""Horror"" movie","Sinister is written and directed by Scott Derrickson, who judging by his resume, this guy loves his horror movies; that I don't have a problem with! I was really looking forward to this flick for two reasons; Insidious was one of my favourite horror movies of the last ten years, so my anticipation grew with the production of Sinister carrying the same producer. And B, prior to seeing Sinister, I watched ""House at the End of the street"" which left me desperate for something fresh.Ellison (Ethan Hawke) is an accomplished writer who brews his career through the premise of true-crime stories. His obsession is based around the majority of murders and mysteries surrounding them, with a weight of controversy surrounding his Journalistic morals.Ellison is hell bent on reaching a peak he is yet to discover in his career while trying to convince himself of the stories he covers are for the people, and not for fame. It is no convenience when he moves his family into their new home, a suburban crime scene; a freakish killing spree that resulted in the hanging of an entire family. Desperate for his big break, Ellison has to manage the Ora surrounding the town and its unspoken crime, and his wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) who is convinced of a refreshing start to a troubled past.Although the Sheriff (Fred Dalton Thompson) voiced his own opinion about Ellison's reputation, it doesn't stop the willingness behind Ellison's personality as he stumbles across a box of horrific surprises that hold a motive behind his current investigation.Without hesitation, Ellison puts the mysterious reel of tapes together as he is disturbed but yet satisfied to witness a plethora of found-footage images that take him on a journey through a nightmare worse than he could have imagined.Desperate to fulfil is unwanted duties, Ellison discovers a dark figure within the murders, a supernatural spirit that haunts those who discover the tapes.Ellison's insight into the murders reveal an origin of secrets that is sure to shock the town as he believes, in cliché journalistic fashion, ""the people must to know"". Although Ellison is not prepared for the danger he could place on his wife and kids as a demon lurks behind his projector of evidence.Judging a book by its cover is not my thing, but by its introduction, that is how I roll!. On the off, Sinister invites you down a dark and twisted path, most likely a journey that you will have never witnessed before. The first scene reveals a taste of refreshing initiative. Originality is not the main key to Sinister because to be blunt, it ain't original, but it is really scary.The main premise is the constant suspense that is revealed within the tapes. It is not graphically gory, just down right disturbing with each video backed up with a frightening tune. Just like Paranormal Activity, the majority of scares are within the backing of found-footage. But apart from the mundane routine events in 21st century horror movies, Sinister succeeds in disturbing the mind of the viewer without actual ""Jump-Scares"" scenes.The plot is fascinating in it's own sick way, following a puzzle that I had no idea how it would come together, but it did, and it did so in original fashion.Looking at the majority of Horrors this year, it is obvious to label Sinister as the best, and certainly the scariest movie of 2012 thus far. I adore my horror movies so I was quite satisfied with a concept that is not entirely fresh, but revealed scenes with simple ideas and found a way of visually implanting an image into the viewers head. It is not always about the full on graphic that disturbs the mind, it is the motive behind it that really gets the viewers asking questions, and better yet, remembering something that almost feels a supernatural reality.Overall/rating; Not entirely original with the folks behind the scenes nit-picking at Insidious and Paranormal Activity. However, the overall creation of horror is really frightening, with scenes that some viewers may find disturbing. Sinister is a successful result of a genre that has unfortunately been the subject of poor and effortless movies lately.

However, despite enjoying the movie, I don't know which way to take the ending. Was it good? Yeah, not bad at all. However, the ending to the film was a little too empty for my liking.

One of the best recent horror movies,"Horror movies post 2010 feel like recycled content, however this feels genuinely good, the atmosphere created by the director is great and the characters, although a bit generic, are fine.

Sinister has a context in which it's horror elements can add to each other and thus accelerate you into terror,"I still remember seeing Sinister four years later after it hit the cinema. And I don't think I'm ever going to forget that day I went to see it. This is the first and only movie I almost quit watching half-way through (if you ignore Sinister 2 which is second worse horror movie I've ever seen, right behind Deliver Us From Evil).Let me immediately emphasize what exactly made Sinister such a frightening experience for me. It is soundtrack. Sinister has the scariest soundtrack I've ever heard. It blends so well and so naturally with the movie in a way that it makes all the scary moments even more scary and horrible. Take a look at, for example, Sleepy Time '98. Don't tell me this music alone doesn't make you nervous.If you combine really creepy soundtrack with disturbing and mysterious snuff videotapes, which permeate the entire movie and go one by one not even allowing you to recover from the previous, then you have a movie which accelerates you into horror. I remember thus reaching a tipping point where I wanted to exit the cinema because tension seemed to grow exponentially. It does and it doesn't stop until the very end. If you've seen the original Paranormal Activity (2007) then you sort of know what awaits you.So, I've asked myself how come Sinister utilizes this simple concept so well and it's sequel, while using the same strategy, fails miserably? Yes, original Sinister has far better soundtrack and a little better snuff movies, but that's not enough to make such a big difference. The explanation lies in utilizing different sub-genre: original Sinister is a mystery horror; sequel doesn't have a strong mystery side but replaces it with a romantic side story. Sinister is so scary because it has a certain framework in which his horror elements make sense and can fully develop. Sinister 2 just tosses snuff videotapes into us as if they alone are enough to make you uncomfortable.Chemistry between family members is far, far more convincing in original sinister then the sequel. Ethan Hawk has been nominated for two more Oscars after playing Ellison Oswalt in Sinister. James Ransone played deputy in the original, but became the main star in the sequel! Some critics blabbered about Ethan Hawk's performance not being convincing. He was solid; nothing more and nothing else.To conclude: There is nothing original about Sinister horror fans hadn't seen before. There are some clichés as well. But Sinister manages to create an ambient in which it's horror elements can add to each other and so accelerate you into terror. So don't buy it from critics: Sinister is not about story or actor's performance. It's about making you more nervous and agitated with each one of it's flicks. That is if you don't find the main premise repulsive. If you can bare it to the end, not quitting like I almost did, you'll be in for an interesting ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Mixed Bag o'Horror,"""Sinister"" is a supernatural mystery horror film which starts out with an extremely strong prologue-an eerie snuff film shot in 8mm-but gets ever more predictable as time goes on, so that by the midpoint at the latest it is not difficult at all to predict how the movie is going to end (I was holding out for a plot twist that would topple my expectations, but alas it did not come).The good performances, especially by Ethan Hawke, some of the aspects involved in the set-up and especially the snuff film sequences are among the strengths of the film.On the other hand, I found the scares to be hit-and-miss: some were quite effective, like a scene involving night terror, but others were so broad as to border on silliness.A bit more subtlety would have done the film good. In fact, my main criticism is that the movie seems to try to hit the audience over the head with what it has to offer: the snuff sequences, the scare scenes, the mystery. That approach only worked for the first and and not so well for the other two.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Terrible film, not worth watching.","I rented this movie after being recommended. Unfortunately I did not enjoy this movie in the slightest.The movie lacked suspense and was very predictable.

Two different ways to haunt,"There are different modes to convey horror, mechanisms that control it; what it comes down to is how a viewer is placed in the vicinity of horror he feels to be there. (it doesn't matter if it is actually there and films that laboriously explain why and how waste their breath)The story here is about this in a way that makes it clear; a crime author comes to live with his family in the house where gruesome murders took place, aiming to write a book about it. Right away we have a viewer placing himself on the scene of horror. Reality in this house is not the same as in any other house, there's a story that lingers.The very first night he discovers something else that lingers - a box containing footage of murders in the attic, a set of images that contain horror.So there are two different placements here, one powerful and eerie, the other silly. The contrast between them is so stark that if ever a horror film school comes about, this should be taught. It will be more insight than film schools deliver in a year.One placement is anchored in these mini-films from the attic. The films themselves are strange, eerie and the most lasting thing about the whole film. Each one of them culminates with murder of course, the grisly stuff we've come to see, throats slashed etc. But more pertinently about the kind of horror they give rise to. Each one is a little more elaborately staged, making us grope in the dark of a house in search of horror we know is coming. Each one contains a hidden reflection of the boogeyman on the scene. Each one is filmed by an unseen presence. Nothing at all is explained of them but taken together they suggest malevolence that spills from them.The other placement simply has weird things happening around the house at night, the usual apparitions, noises from the attic, that before long we come to understand as supernatural in origin. It's all as contrived as it sounds on that end and seems to come from a lesser film. Nothing is intricately sketched in this set of images, no hidden reflections. Everything is explained about them in due time.And you'll see what I mean by looking at the stories that evolve from each set of images.One gives rise to a frightening reality; someone in an eerie mask has been out there for a long time committing atrocity to some inscrutable purpose, a devious mind who has hid in sleepy suburbias like this and might be out there now, watching. The story emanates from what the images conceal (with a little help from a policeman).The other story is formulaic fantasy foisted on us by an ""occult expert"", simply delivered by a talking head to a camera; nonsense about a Babylonian deity that actually lives in images and comes out to literally harness souls. Here we have ""devious"" scares and then a full story comes up to explain them.In both cases we end up in theory with much the same thing; evil that defies sense, hides in and inhabits images and spills out from them to haunt the place. But what a world of difference between them. Don't listen to me; what part did you find eerie?",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"ahh, 8mm home films...","Great opening and good ending! (probably one of the freakiest opening shots that I have seen!) And lots of creepiness in-between, especially with the attic and the 8mm film! But I think there was too much tension and build up in between. And once the filmmakers kind of revealed a big piece of what was happening, I kind of wanted the movie to just get to the point and show me how the patterns and backstories applied to the family in the film.

Unsettling horror,"Sinister is truly unsettling horror that's extremely effective tension and atmosphere linger long after the credits roll.

James Ransone is great with a supporting character who feels slightly more layered than expected thanks to his performance and the material.Scott Derrickson's direction is excellent, the film has more enough genuinely scary set pieces spread throughout the film.

Great Horror Movie!,"I must say, this is really a great horror movie! Don't listen to all the bad reviews, if you like movies such as Insidious, you will not be disappointed! I believe that some people, even without watching the film, gets the wrong impression of it.. maybe because they are not into Paranormal Activity, but let me be clear on this, this movie is nothing like Paranormal Activity! If you are the kind of person who just loves movies who gets more and more terrifying, then you should go see this, you will not be let down! And the acting in Sinister is also brilliant! Believe me, you will jump in your seat during this film, thats for sure. So as a conclusion i will give this movie 9/10 stars!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Don't waste your time...,"I have never felt the need to share my views on IMDb before today but I have just come out of a screening of Sinister and am so angry that I have had to write this to calm down... What utter dross this movie was. From start to finish it was the most unimaginative, badly directed, uninspired trash have seen in a long time.It's like someone has taken pieces from a 'make your own horror movie' kit and pasted them together until they all seemed to fit together and then presented the finished result as an original piece of work. Truly lazy and untalented movie making.As far as the acting goes, Ethan Hawke coasts his way through his performance but the other actors are just not good..If this film had been cheesy or had any flair or originality of style applied to it, I think it would have not been so bad, but the prosaic style of direction left it feeling like a soulless, cut and paste money making exercise.Don't waste your time... Maybe Sinister II will be better...",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Almost perfect,"I was genuinely terrified watching this, very unexpected, plenty of scares with the 8mm films creepy and disturbing. A film full of that type of footage would have pushed the boundaries. Some simple filmmaking that delivers however the ending was a let down for me and opened up some gaping plot holes, nonetheless, a definite must watch for horror fans.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Excellent!,Excellent! I don't normally watch horror films as they never scare me and normally the gore looks really fake - too cheesy but I decided to check this out after seeing the trailer.This didn't scare me at all because to be honest only real ghost stories scare me and life in general not something I know isn't real but even so this was fantastic! This was really entertaining with an excellent plot and incredible twist ending! The actors did a good job and the monster in the story did make me jump a few times even though I didn't have nightmares or actually feel scared...make up was done well. I think he looked believable.I was hooked all the way through! I would watch this again! Great!,9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Yeah, not bad - it did its best","I suppose how much you enjoy Sinister will depend on how well you know your horror movies. Enough time has elapsed since The Ring for Hollywood to think that most audiences will have forgotten about 'that sort of horror.' Ethan Hawke plays a real-crime writer, who deliberately moves his family into the home of another family who were all murdered, so that he can study tapes of the crime for his upcoming book. Once there, he naturally starts finding himself in the middle of all sorts of spooky goings on.The Ring had a 'killer video tape,' whereas Sinister has... well, it's not completely different. And instead of a female lead investigating it, you have Ethan Hawke. And so on. Okay, so Sinister isn't a complete rip-off of The Ring, but it just felt like it was definitely in the same area of dark, brooding, supernatural, creepy horror.And it's not bad. With the seemingly endless flow of monster/ghost movies out there, it takes something a little different to stand out. And Sinister just about manages to raise its head above the pile. If you read the marketing, you'll see people raving about just how scary it was. I didn't find it that scary, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it.It is quite dark - by that I mean literally (not just the subject matter, which, obviously, is also quite dark). The film is mainly shot inside one house which you could be forgiven for thinking that they don't have a single light bulb in any room. Some may say that adds to the atmosphere, others may find it too hard to tell what's going on. Perhaps my only gripe would be that I found the whole family a little annoying. Ethan Hawke's character is obsessed with being famous. His 'loving' wife never seems to bother looking after the kids, leaving all disciplining to him (it even took me a while to work out whether the mother was actually the biological mother or a stepmother, as she repeatedly refers to the children - when speaking to her husband - as ""your children""). Plus the kids themselves are hardly endearing - the girl's okay, but the boy (don't be fooled by his haircut - he IS a boy) is surly and generally unlikeable.It's no classic, but it does offer enough different to make it worth a watch.Special mention to the local sheriff's deputy - just a minor, if quite cool character.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Excellent horror movie, perfect Ethan Hawke.","I'm not saying it's a perfect movie, the actor was, and i'm a big fan of his work, but for the actual scares and story, it was very effective. A big 8/10 for me. Because there's not many movies that freaked me out that way and all of the people in the theater were scared as hell like me, and it was a good feeling overall. The movie succeed in giving goosebumps all the way to the end. With that beginning, the 1st minute you know it's gonna be hard sometimes to watch and i love how obsessed the character of Ethan Hawke is and who really looks like a writer and reminds me sometimes of Johnny Depp in Secret Window. This movie gives a grand finale that will be remembered and will have sequels as well... i'm just surprised that this movie has a 3-4 millions budget, i guess 1.5 for Ethan and the rest for the movie because it has not big stars except of b-league ''theses days'' Vincent D'Onofrio who is in the movie for barely 5 minutes but he is very good !",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Primed To Rob You of Sleep,"It's a rarity when it comes to the marketing of horror films that the tidbits they toss to the masses can be both potent in their ability to allure crowds all while not spoiling the film's biggest scares. Sinister unleashed a truly terrifying promotional campaign that highlighted some of its more impactful frights, but kept enough under wraps to deliver 110 minutes of continuous tension and terror.In a number of ways, Sinister could be viewed as a companion piece to 2011's Insidious and not just in name. Both take an uncommonly smart and restrained approach to horror, derive their thrills from the presence of a chilling demonic presence and feature a father fighting for the protection of his children. However, in spite of the parallels that can be drawn, Sinister is its own beast and is easily stands as one of the best fright flicks of the year.What Sinister does best is maintain tension for extended sequences. Even when it's building its characters or unravelling the mystery, we're biting our nails because we know the tenseness is bound to return soon. The pagan deity known as Bagul, who serve's as this film's boogeyman, is only shown in fleeting instances, usually from afar on a blurry Super-8 film reel zoomed in upon, and rarely shown in crisp entirety. This makes the quiet moments – the before the storm scenes – all the more potent.To quickly shed a bit of light on the story, Sinister follows a true crime novelist with the unfortunate name of Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) who a decade prior had a massive hit on his hands, but has hit some bad luck since with his foray into fiction. Looking for his next big story, he moves his wife (Juliet Rylance) and his daughter and son to a home that happens to be the scene of a grisly murder of four and the disappearance of a fifth. Finding a box of film reels and a projector in the attic, Ellison sifts through the footage and begins to uncover a shocking history of gruesome violence.Ellison is an interesting character due to his flawed nature and instances of unlikeability, which then ultimately blend well with the scenes depicting him as a good man at heart and a caring father. Ellison becomes so obsessed with regaining his mantle, ""creating a legacy"" as he puts it, that he often forgets his legacy is his children. It's a somewhat chancy decision in a horror film when you already have to deal with obstacles such as characters behaving idiotically. Ellison's dual nature also gives the typical ""nagging wife"" archetype a justifiable reason to bitch and Rylance's Tracey does so in a way that makes us root for her, for him, both or them and them as a collective family.When it comes to idiocy in horror films, Sinister as does an admirable job of avoiding, if not masking, the tendency. As more and more is revealed about Bagul and his motives (and as troubling as it all may be), there is no apparent threat. Simply the odd bump in the night and the conclusions of a drunken author submersing himself so thoroughly into his disturbing work that he begins to doubt the conclusions he's drawing. It is in this area, Sinister sidesteps the ""door paradox."" There is really no overpowering reason they should immediately leave.One thing that did stick in my craw, however, was Ellison's propensity to wander around the home without thinking to switch on a light (and he stalks around the house far too much – it becomes a tad repetitive despite the tense execution). In one such instance there was a power outage but in the other cases it's rather maddening and an obvious attempt to retain the gloomy aesthetic of the scene.Additionally, I would strongly suggest to Tracey that she visit a sleep doctor because her patterns are wild at best. At one instance she awakes at the sound of her husband opening the door to investigate a noise and at another he tumbles from the attic hatch and we don't see a glimpse of her. It wouldn't have taken much to have her appear at the other occasions, especially considering her arrival wouldn't have impacted any scares or tension.That being said, Sinister is uniformly: a) well directed by Scott Derrickson b) acted (by Hawke in particular though the child actors are underused) and c) deeply unsettling as a whole. Upon leaving the theater there was a decidedly large lump in my stomach. The creature design of Bagul is outstanding and when we linger on the demon's face (such as a scene where Ellison walks up to the projector screen and inquisitively strokes the image) it's terrifying even when all real world logic says it shouldn't be.Capping everything off is the score by Christopher Young, which has become my favorite of the year. Young, who unsurprisingly upon further investigation also worked on Drag Me to Hell, offers up a collection of cacophonous clangs, crashes and off-key instrumental strokes that compliments the material perfectly.Concluding everything with a perfect ending that doesn't betray the fictional logic and lore the film creates and utilizing found footage as, well, actual found footage, Sinister is primed to rob you of sleep and stands to this day the only horror film to make me involuntarily shut my eyes. That is worth kudos in of itself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Effective.,"I find this one of the better horror/supernatural films I've ever watched. The story is based on the occult and a form of the haunted house premise. The latter might seem much too clichéd but it was done rather well. Good acting, good suspense, and good sense of unease.If only the first half of the movie isn't that slow or even boring, I would've bumped my rating up to 8/10. However, the remaining part of the movie was done very effectively and almost covered the dullness of the beginning. And as for the closing of the film, I loved it.Might recommend but with a fair warning on the slow first half.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Clever film, although the ending was a tad predictable, and upsetting.","Sinister is an average horror film for the most part that isn't very scary. The jump scares are pretty poorly done, and at times it feels a bit silly and cliche. But, I am a fan of how dark the actual story is, and how a decent bit of the murders is actually shown in the rolls of film that are found by Ethan Hawke's character. Take out the silly jump scares and the demon children running around the house in the second half of the runtime, and it's a pretty solid horror movie. For me the ending was a tad predictable, and upsetting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
GENUINELY CREEPY,"Aside from having a well-written plot and characters, the horror classic was packed with non-cheap jumpscares unlike its contemporaries. Ethan Hawke played his character well. He really embodied such a assertive but unsuspecting character that it was almost impossible not to get irritated by him. I loved how characters like this really engages audiences. That just made the entire movie relatable. The detective-type plot of this horror film also was the thing that managed to keep my attention to it. Each scene was exciting because something interesting was always unfolding, and that is a testament to how well-written this horror flick was.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Lots of ""boo!"" moments, but very well done. Scared me silly!","EDITED: Feb. 27, after 2nd watch.I've just finished watching Sinister, and I must confess that my heart is still pounding. I hate to say it, but it made me jump in my seat a few times. Why do I hate to say it? Because as a devout and pretty experienced Horror fan, I really find it hard to respect films that use ""cheats"" (i.e slow shooting with very dark lighting, suddenly a frightening shot with a blast of loud bass music) that appeal more to a viewer's physiology than their logic and fear. Still, if you're gonna use that ""cheat"", then this is definitely the way to do so! Sometimes it's real fun being scared like that.I didn't find the screenplay and story to be all that original, as we've seen many films using very similar backgrounds, but I did like it. Gruesome murders, missing children, found footage as part of the plot (rather than the entire film being a ""mockumentary""), and one Ethan Hawk trying to get to the bottom of all while fighting to save his career and keep his family and marriage from paying the price. Pretty decent, yet pretty generic.Sinister uses elements from different sub-genres and adds them up together to give the viewer a very healthy scare. I especially liked the fact that the audience can't really know what type of Horror film this is (Ghosts? Slasher/Murderer? Occult/Supernatural? All of the above?) until around the middle, and that unlike in other films - in this case the plot synopsis here doesn't spoil it. The acting was also good, though mainly by the rest of the cast (for instance Michael Hall D'Addario and Clare Foley as the two children, or Fred Dalton Thompson and James Ransone as the Sheriff and Deputy), I don't really appreciate Ethan Hawk's obvious overacting in this one (though I guess his acting is like pineapple as a pizza topping, you either like it or you don't).As for the ending, I always enjoy Horror more when a clever plot twist is applied, enhancing the feeling of suspense and the using the element of surprise to increase the overall sensation of fear (very much like psycho-thriller films). In Sinister, the ending doesn't involve such a twist per se, but it definitely binds together many pieces of information and succeeds in being unpredictable and horrifying (even when watching for the 2nd time!)One of the best features of this film is the original soundtrack, which is dark and eerie and definitely takes the overall feeling of discomfort to a new level. This is especially noticed when the protagonist watches the old silent films.Like I've said, if you're going to appeal to the audience's physiology and jump from behind the closet shouting ""boo!"", do it right, and Sinister definitely does it right! Very very few Horror films in this day and age don't use any ""cheats"" at all, and when done well enough - the ""boo!"" thing isn't really that much of a cheat. I've really enjoyed watching this film, and would recommend it to anyone who fancies themselves a tough viewer. Sit at home alone, turn off the lights, and watch this. It was 8:30 a.m when I first watched it, and it still scared me silly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A lot of build up for lackluster payoff,"The film has a promising enough setup, albeit pretty generic and not that original. It has good acting, and does a good job reeling you in, but as you watch and you start to piece together the puzzle, the ending becomes pretty predictable. This movie isn't really that scary, (unless you find possessed children REALLY scary) but the boogieman dude can be pretty creepy, I guess. There are a couple cheap jumpscares that are typical for films like this, but thankfully they're few and far between. This film isn't bad, there are plenty of horror movies that are MUCH worse, It's just cookie cutter and interchangeable with other movies like Insidious. Watch it if you really want, but your time is probably better spent watching something else. You're not missing out on anything by not watching Sinister",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Solid story line for a Horror Movie,"Am writing this Review as a fan of Horror flicks.Most of the horror movie will be emphasized with the Sound effects, blood splitting scenes and with CG and they will be weak in the story line but sinister is an exceptional from other horror movies.Solid story line which carry's the whole movie without any blur, and appropriate sound effects which scares the hell out the viewers.The reasons why the movie is good are: i) Ethan's performance adds additional strength to the plot and is acting was perfectly matched. ii) Sound effects was incredible and specially when Ethan sees the home videos it was to the core. iii) Very few number of characters which gives a accurate phase for the movie.SINISTER goes around the hero a lot who is a crime author trying to pull of the things back and getting his family into the jeopardy. The movie was going around Ethan and less focus on his family members. The surprise character is a boogie man which they must have given some more explanation on him rather than pulling the religious ideas.Totally Sinister is a must watch movie for horror fans.Even if you are not a horror fan you can give a try worth watching it.Hope it will be more scary to the core if Sinister 2 releases...Lets wait and get scared...!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Compelling and creepy,"I much prefer horror films with a naturally scary and compelling story behind them than those that simply adopt jump scares with little regard for any sort of plot, and while 'Sinister' is guilty of cheap scares and the odd ridiculous aspect, it is built upon a solid and extremely creepy mystery.Sure, it is riddled with clichés and lacks originality in the way it frightens, but ultimately you watch a horror movie to be scared, and 'Sinister' is successfully scary. The suspense builds nicely and the mystery will keep you guessing and guessing until the end.'Sinister' is a compelling and creepy horror movie that will satisfy most fans of this genre, even those that aren't easily scared.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Too long, repetitive and not that scary","The trailer for this movie was more scary than the movie itself, hich was disappointing. Maybe I saw way too many horror movies to the point I am unfazed by them...Which would be sad. But this movie just wasn't all that scary, in fact the scare factor is pretty low. It does have creepy and eerie vibe going for it with some clever dialogue at times. But this movie just seemed way to repetitive and too long. Yes, there was some gasps from the audience but some of them was whispering when this movie was going to end. So the plot is about a one hit wonder author that tries to get back into the limelight by dragging him and his family to a house where some brutal murders happened. And soon he finds some super 8 films that has titles on them. And each one has gristly murders, but there really isn't a coherent way it connects to the whole story. It's like watching a couple of snuff films but it doesn't seem to connect with the main story all that well. Thus it becomes less interesting and less clever. It has a decent idea going for it but it was just poorly executed without any real scares. The ending is also disappointing as well and doesn't bring anything new to the table for horror fans.

Always the same thing?,"Meh, I've seen worse things, but it could also be much better. This is that film that gains some fame within its genre, but which, in my opinion, doesn't innovate much, because to be honest, I've seen films very similar to this one quite a few times and there comes a point where you start to get tired of watching it so many times. The same thing. That's what happens with this film, although it starts in an interesting way it ends up getting lost as time passes, which also ruins the experience a little. I didn't think the ending was very shocking, because when you find out what's going to happen to the protagonist, he ends up not caring much and not even the slightest bit worried, which doesn't make much sense. But one thing I like is Ethan Hawke's performance, I think he manages to give a little life to this film that has ideas that have already been worn out over the years in cinema.

Something Truly Sinister,"If you can find new ways to expand on familiar formulas, you just might have a good horror movie. ""Sinister"" isn't a good horror movie. It's a GREAT one. Directed by Scott Derrickson (director of ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose""), this shiver-inducing fright fest is the perfect genre flick for the Halloween season or any time of year.Ellison Oswalt is a struggling writer, barely living off of money he made from a book that was successful at least 10 years ago. In order to make his comeback and pen down a thrilling new piece of non-fiction, he moves his wife, Tracy, and children, Ashley and Trevor, into a new house. The family isn't exactly fond of this choice, but they're warming up to it. ""I'm going to write the best book anyone's ever read,"" Ellison tells Ashley. They don't know, however, that they have just moved into a crime scene. Several years ago, a family was hung from a tree in this house's backyard, and the daughter is yet to be found. The most disturbing notion, for Ellison, is that while in the writing process, he discovers and watches this and other gruesome acts on Super 8 videotapes he found in the attic. But there is an unsettling string attached to these murders, and it's lurking in the background of the screen.Sure, ""Sinister"" follows the formula of other horror films, but it doesn't dumb things down for the audience. Once we find out terrible things happened in this setting, a lot of the fear we expect is in the imagination, with creaking floorboards, slamming doors, and eerie whispering. Therefore, it is a brilliantly scary horror film. I haven't been this terrified since ""Insidious."" And surprise, surprise. ""Sinister"" is produced by Jason Blum, producer of ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""Insidious.""Owing a lot to ""The Shining,"" ""The Amityville Horror,"" and ""The Ring,"" newcomer C. Robert Cargill and director Derrickson have written a smart script with a truly nightmarish villain: not just the film's monster, but film itself. The Super 8 tapes presented to us are some of the most disturbing pieces of footage I have ever seen, and they definitely give a feeling of discomfort to the viewer. If a horror movie can make you feel appropriately uncomfortable, then it's done its job.The cast is actually small, and it is led by A-list performer Ethan Hawke as Ellison. Hawke has given his best performance in years. At first, Ellison seems like a selfish jerk. He's not exactly the perfect father figure for Ashley and Trevor, and it's a miracle that Tracy has endured this much with him. But after he finds the Super 8s, he's not in this to make a book out of blood money. He's concerned and dying to put together the pieces of the puzzle before anyone else is endangered. Hawke portrays that flawlessly, and it's pretty obvious that he wouldn't have chosen to be a part of this movie if it wasn't good.Newcomer Juliet Rylance is also very good as Tracy, her best moment being when she finally confronts Ellison about his actions. She is believable and always sympathetic. James Ransone also stars as a town deputy, providing some great humor to help the audience breathe before the big ""BOO!"" And Vincent D'Onofrio goes uncredited as a professor who provides Ellison with a hefty amount of information about the events behind these home movies.The jump scares of ""Sinister"" are perfectly executed, and there are no cats waiting to falsely freak you out. All of the horror in this film is real and genuine. From the beginning, ""Sinister"" is dark in terms of atmosphere and tone, and the ending, unlike the opinions of the critics, gave me chills. Why ""Paranormal Activity 4"" would make more money than this film is understandable, but that doesn't make that sequel a good movie. This is the rare film that incorporates found footage into a realistic, non-home video setting and it manages to scare you out of your wits. You want something frightening? ""Sinister"" is the best horror movie of 2012. Not for the faint of heart, but it will suit the needs of the more intelligent horror movie buffs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Very well made modern day horror,"This horror movie is one of the best I've ever seen. From the fantastic acting to the scary scenes that will genuinely creep you out, none of those cheap jump scares crap, I mean like actually being frightened. Baghoul is an evil spirit/presence in the movie, but he's not like a monster made of CGI effects that you see throughout the movie, you see his handiwork more than you actually see him, but in my opinion, his handiwork is much scarier than them actually showing you his face. Because to me what you make up in your own mind and your own imagination is scarier than them just showing you the thing you're supposed to be afraid of. They do use that method and it works wonderfully in this movie. The cast is very good and I loved all the performances. Ethan Hawke is a very talented actor, I've known that since Dead Poets Society when he was just starting out. He gives a very good performance as the writer father who begins to research this thing that has haunted and killed other innocents in the past. As he digs deeper and deeper the movie gets even more entertaining (and scarier). I suggest this movie to anyone who likes a very well-made horror movie. It is directed very well and it's evident that the writers knew exactly what they were doing. 8/10 for Sinister.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good film.,"There is a tendency within horror movies to concentrate everything interesting in the final ten minutes. That happens in Sinister, that happens in Paranormal Activity and many more movies. Here we have the case of a writer looking for inspiration (as in The Shining, as in I Spit on your Grave) and is accompanied by his family (as in Paranormal Activity and hundreds of other movies) and ending up finding it through his true son supernatural element (like Jumanji, Evil Dead) and trying to unravel the matter end up facing the most terrible fate (like any horror movie). Being a film whose creative roots are closely connected to many films, then the only thing that will make it stand out is the way it closes the story arc, and in this case it does it well. Its pace may be a little slower than I liked, but it's well done and the ending is excellent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It's all in the details for both us and Ellison,"Research and questioning are two of the most powerful activities a human being can partake in. Absorbing yourself in a story or a crime case is something that is just as powerful, as well. During the time of the tragic Aurora, Colorado theater shooting and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that absolutely tore the United States apart as a whole, you couldn't pry my fingers away from the keyboard or my face from the monitor. I never saw myself so in-tuned , captivated, disgusted, and riveted by a news story in all my life.Thankfully, I never experience an obsession with a case or past events like the one our lead character Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) in Sinister immerses himself into. He is a consumed crime author, who wrote a successful book some years ago, and decides to leave his old home behind and take his wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and their two children Ashley (Clare Foley) and Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario) to live in an old, spacious home that was once the site of an unexplainable crime scene. The only one who knows this is Ellison, who is warned upon his arrival by the town deputy (James Ransone) that living here isn't smart, but he is so involved with his career as an author he doesn't listen.Ellison begins to find old Super 8 films in the attic of the home, discovering that they're snuff films depicting various grisly murders and usually titled by an ambiguous event and date (""Sleep Time '98"" is the name of one). His minor fascination turns wholly consuming, as he locks himself in his study, playing the films on a rickety old projector, desperately trying to uncover the mystery of the house. During this time, his children begin exhibiting the strangest of behaviors and his wife's tolerance and silence to his reclusive nature becomes unrelenting and maddening on her part.Sinister opens on the precise foot, creepy, unnerving, and yes, terrifying. It shows Super 8 footage of four people, all standing below a tree, with nooses around their neck and hoods covering their faces before something cuts off one of the tree's limbs, which acts as a counterweight, successfully hanging all four of the characters. This is a wrenching scene that perfectly sets the tone for the film we're about to see.There's a surprising sophistication to the material in Sinister, which makes it the most surprising horror effort of last year. For a mainstream release, it's stunningly atmospheric and almost poetry stemming from Gothic roots. I can only compare it, recently, to The Woman in Black, a film attempting to replicate the style and potency that is found in Hammer Horror films. At the center of that film was Harry Potter's Daniel Radcliffe, doing one of his first solo, grown-up roles after years of being the subject of a lucrative franchise. Sinister throws Ethan Hawke in a wonderfully subtle performance, providing depth and massive conflict to his character as a whole.The thing about Sinister is, by horror film standards, it does much more than we expect it to, and for that matter, does it all to a certain level of efficiency and craft. It abandons much of the ""jump-scare"" cliché, and uses it cautiously and with great effect, it focuses on characters, disciplined and rational, it shows Ellison's descent into obsession effectively and realistically, relies on setting, sound, and tone to invoke fear in its audience, and pulls out an engaging story to tie everything back together.The film's best scene comes shortly after the hour mark and involves Ellison and Tracy angrily spitting words with venom and hate back and forth, Ellison saying how his book, while potentially sacrificing his family's safety, will buoy them financially, and Tracy saying how he has become such an unrecognizable man being buried and eaten alive by his work. This gives a good ethics debate for the average audience member, who is usually sitting frozen or bored, yet likewise, waiting for something to happen; is it okay to sacrifice personal welfare for potential financial security or live a cautious life with no security? Finally, one detail I forgot to mention was the use of sound in Sinister, not just from the abrupt scares or the sudden ""pangs"" in the night, but the click of the Super 8 film, the whirring of the projector, the snapping of the film, and the crackling static of the sound quality. This is a more stylistically alive film, in terms of classic detail, than the latter Paranormal Activity series.Starring: Ethan Hawke, Juliet Rylance, Fred Thompson, James Ransone, Clare Foley, and Michael Hall D'Addario.

"Great film, truly terrifying, superb in every way","Like the summary says, I loved this movie. Lately I've been watching about 2 horror movies a week (what can I say, Redbox can have some good ones and I'm a huge horror fan, do the math), and this is by far one of the best I've ever seen. It's scary and terrifying, but doesn't have a lot of gore. The score, the directing, the acting, the lighting were all done in a way that they fit so perfectly together. I watched it with the director's commentary after seeing it all the way through, and it was great to hear how the stunts were done, how the lighting was achieved, etc., etc. If you're a fan of horror this is a must watch movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Despite Hawke's superb performance and a few scary moments, most of Sinister relies on cheap jump-scares.","Summary: Despite Hawke's superb performance and a few scary moments, most of Sinister relies on cheap jump-scares. 50/100 (C)True-crime writer Ellison Oswalt moves himself and his family into a house where a horrific crime took place earlier, but his family doesn't know. He is trying to find out more about the crime so he can write a new book about it to help his flailing career. He uses some ""snuff"" film footage he finds in the house to help in his research, but he soon finds more than he bargained for. There is a figure in each of the films, but who or what is it? As a result, his family start to suffer (as does he), and things take a turn for the worse. Will they survive? Sinister is a horror film written and directed by Scott Derrickson, and well... I'm not a huge fan of his previous work.The opening scene is awesome and looks realistic, but this little scene becomes quite tedious because is being constantly repeated throughout the film again and again, making it less effective. But the movie boasts an interesting story, also Ethan Hawke's performance was awesome and you can feel identified with his character. It has enough originality in some of the scares and it definitely stands out from other films of the genre. The special effects were generally good, except in a few scenes where lots of CGI were used on some crappy ghost-kids. The CGI scenes disgusted me so much, because the film doesn't need them at all.What I really found interesting and clever, is the content of the Super 8 tapes, it's undoubtedly scary. Some scenes made me jump and they looked very realistic. It's pretty decent and the performances were very enjoyable, in spite of some awful child actors. It's also very sad to see Hawke's character, for some strange reason I felt sorry for him, he just wanted to write his book and be famous again. For me, the stars of the film are Hawke and Juliet Rylance, these two actors were very professional in the movie, they seem serious all time and I really enjoyed every conversation they had, all their fights, discussions, etc.It has too much suspense at times and becomes boring. It's filled with a bunch of generic loud noises, cheap jump-scares and constant darkness. I've seen Sinister more than three times already: the first time I saw it by myself, the second time I saw it with my sister, and the last time I saw it alone... again. I really wanted to like it. Anyway, it's just not my type of horror film. I do not recommend Sinister for horror fans, it's very boring, the editing is horrible and its plot is cliché. On the upside, the script is solid at times, it has quality performances and some suspense. With all that, it creates a mildly frightening atmosphere.I think that it has enough jump-scares and good performances to satisfy a big part of the clueless audience. Moving on, the last fifteen minutes are quite messy, while at times it kept the tension, nobody can rescue the film of being a total boredom. It became very explicit in its final act. Also, the last scare of the movie was silly and predictable. Sinister fails to convince and entertain. I'm a huge fan of Hawke but the movie doesn't deserve a positive review because it has lots of flaws, especially in its final act. I would like to see less of the villain (Mr. Boogie) in the film, unfortunately they showed way too much of him and became less scary.As I said, the acting was great, Ethan Hawke and the charismatic British actress Juliet Rylance were excellent. The script is mostly solid, the content of the Super 8 tapes is very disturbing, and there were a few scary moments in the movie. I recommend it if you expect great performances or if you get scared easily. On the downside: all the suspense built up throughout the film falls flat at the end, the performances of some ""ghost"" children were awful and some of the actions of the characters were somewhat stupid. So, if you want an entertaining, memorable and well-executed horror movie, Sinister is not your best choice. (C)",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
one of best films in a long time,"i could go on and on about this movie. to start with it opens right on the spot of the action. after 5 minutes you get right in to it i love that it gets right to the story.over all the film was start to finish suspense,horror and mystery with an accurate ending. the acting was fabulous by all i especially loved deputy so and so i was so pleased to see him take the lead role in sinister 2. who ever that boggy man was he was great. if i saw him in my house i would throw him the keys and say enjoy your new home i am out. the story ,plot, screenplay music score and set were perfect. i am still watching this movie its one of my favorites. because it still gets me going and is that not the primordial experience you want. one does not watch horror for amusement but to feel it in the pit of your stomach. this is first rate horror as its meant to be!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A real shock for me, more than if I was a kid.","I have always thought that the most terrific and terrifying movie ever concerning haunted mansions, manors was Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING, back in 1963, which continues to make me startle each time I watch it. And before watching SINISTER, back in 2012, I still was convinced that it would not change. But, since, I have a bit modified my opinion. Of course there are hundreds and hundreds of movies and franchises since - SINISTER, CONJURING, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, so you could get a bit lost, puzzled among all those materials. But this one, SINISTER, is really above the rest. It is shocking and disturbing, spooky and nasty.... But THE HAUNTING will always be the HAUNTING for me. Nevertheless, if you had to watch ONLY ONE horror movie about this scheme, SINISTER is definitely the one you should choose, with also maybe PARANORMAL ACTIVITY which is ONLY spooky, not terrifying nor nasty.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
above-average horror film,"The autumn chill hits, and it's a good time for horror movies...Sinister comes from the people who gave us Paranormal Activity and also The Exorcism Of Emily Rose. Only it's a little more... sinister. Found footage of snuff movies heralds its adult credentials before you've had time to choke on the nachos or splutter salsa over the person in front. Copy picture A family is murdered. Months later, comeback writer Ellison Osborne moves into the house with his family. In the attic, he discovers a box of tapes that includes footage of many murders. Unbeknown to his family, he has chosen the house in order to research a true-crime novel. Having only had one bestseller, he sees this as his lucky break, his chance to write his In Cold Blood. The children start to act strangely and his good wife freaks out on him when she discovers the real reason they are living there.Ethan Hawke, as Ellison, and lovely Shakespearean actress Juliet Rylance playing his wife, Tracy, immediately strike us as realistic characters worthy of belief and empathy. Their convincing personas have more depth than the average shock- flick, and we are sorely tempted to consider whether this at heart might be a psychological thriller of Hitchcockian nastiness. Yet if the trailer hasn't given everything away, we are transported into a dark world of malignant forces the minute Ellison discovers a strange symbol repeated on the death tapes. Strong supporting acts appear in the form of a local police deputy – who changes from doting fanboy to calm, collected criminologist; and a little later Professor Jonas – the expert on bizarre cults. The professor makes this Babylonian demon 'Bagul' sound so realistic that you could be forgiven for wondering if Sinister is based on a true story, with Mansonesque worshippers helping Bagul to find souls of children to feast on.More lost footage. More creaks and bumps in the Osborne family's almost endless night. Ellison is losing the plot, but we are barely a knife-edge ahead of him. Cue cute kids, cue creepy kids, cue dead kids. Sinister will shortly become shriek-out-loud horror. As well as creeping inside your head on the way home, insidious horror. Polished production values handle clichéd camera jerks with admirable restraint. What we can see and know on-screen is nasty; what we don't know is even more unsettling. Perhaps pausing only to admire the exquisite backing tracks and diligently applied sound effects, we soon realise we are hooked on trying to solve the mystery: who was the killer? Sinister's dark humour is equally discreet. Rather than being played for quick laughs, it emphasises the fear experienced by our protagonists. When Ellison is threatened by a Cujo-sized dog, he speaks soothingly, gently, while muttering a desire for the baseball bat to smash its skull in. And during a row with his wife, he says he hasn't 'really' brought them to house where murder was committed, since our crime occurred 'in the garden' (""As if that makes any difference!"" Tracy explodes.) Horror films sometimes work by challenging us to confront the things we abhor, and all from the safety of a cinema seat. Whether physical (mass murderers), mental (psychological threats) or psychical (supernatural happenings), horrors on a movie-screen do not have to be real – just real enough to remind us of something that could be. Our inner demons. The things we fear most. It could be said the 'ghost' haunting Ellison Osborne, his creeping, sweating, drink-sozzled paranoia, is evoked by his frankly unsavoury and obsessive career, his life's dream, that is in reality destroying the family that he loves and frightening his children. As with Frankenstein before him, Ellison's monstrosities might be partly of his own making. It might be tempting to see the monster as a reflection of him. Yet the very visible on-screen ghosts are nevertheless small works of art that capture our senses. That, and the gut- churningly self-assured, unexpected and irresistibly compelling ending swiftly sweep aside mundane interpretations.Given the effort put into getting it right, a part of me would still have loved to see a police psychiatrist in the coda explaining how everything really happened. An ultimate reliance on the supernatural is fine for horror fans, but inevitably weakens mainstream impact. (Imagine Norman Bates had summoned his mother back from the dead instead of just putting a wig on.) Sinister is far too derivative to be accorded a big place in cinema history; but this souped-up, low-budget compendium of dread is still more satisfying than most horror films that graced our screens this summer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Better than Insidious,"Saw this with my mother. We both enjoyed it. I thought the performances were really good in the movie. Take the scene where Ethan and his wife are yelling at each other. Great deliveries! There's also a scene where Ethan is talking to the deputy and he keeps fidgeting while he's talking. Most performers would overact and it wouldn't come off as natural, but Ethan pulled it off like a pro!I never felt like the movie was scary, just having a creepy atmosphere. The film stock he watches are pretty messed up. Even the titles given to each of the film like BBQ and Pool Party only to see how that is depicted on how these people die is really messed up. Then it leads into this ghost which I honestly felt the movie would be more creepy without it. It's a scary looking thing, don't get me wrong. I would be creeped out by it too. It just wasn't needed. However, once you find out that it manipulates children, you will see where the film is going.There are two things that did bother me about this movie. I thought the creepy demon children were almost laughable. They just looked like make up on Halloween to me. I'm sure the kids enjoyed their transformation but it looked silly to me, especially the scene where they are dancing around Ethan during one part. The second thing was the ending. I predicted it but didn't think it would be so abrupt. It was just there and it was like the filmmakers had to get this film done quickly because they were running out of money. That's what I got.Sinister was good. I enjoyed it better than Insidious. Looking forward to what these guys bring out next year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of the scariest horror films in years.,"Sinister stars Ethan Hawke,Juliet Rylance and Fred Thompson.

Soon then,strange things start to happen around his house and with his family when soon it's all leading up to one thing..a man from the snuff videos called the Boogeyman. Sinister honestly so god damn scary,I was terrified going to sleep when I saw this I just couldn't get it out of my head then it passed but I was still scared and I made a pact never to watch it again. The acting was good but the jump scares was terrifying as hell. I actually screamed when the boogeyman jumped out when Ethan Hawke walked up the attic and saw all the children watching the tapes.

Hawke goes horrorshow.,"Horror veteran Scott Derrickson (Hellraiser: Inferno, The Exorcism of Emily Rose) returns to his favourite genre with Sinister, a peculiar, prodding and probing film that, like most horrors, has its quality dictated by the type of audience watching it.Ethan Hawke plays Ellison, a true crime writer who takes his work a little too seriously. Not content to simply research his cases, Ellison insists on a more hands-on experience in his quest for justice. When he moves his unwitting family to a new home, recently placed on the market courtesy of the last owners being hanged in their backyard, Ellison learns that the grisly details of the case extend far beyond this gruesome incident. Whoever is behind the crime has tallied victims all over the US since the mid-60s, while the only thread linking one crime to the next is the killer's sparing of the youngest child.Sinister spends most of its first half as a police procedural infused with horror, rather than the other way around, and works quite well in that regard. Despite a mostly derivative supporting cast, Hawke is engaging as a determined man tortured by his insatiable curiosity, and watching him piece together the clues- with virtually no help from the police force he has so viciously antagonised in his books- makes for magnetic viewing.Inevitably, though, there comes that unmistakable moment that confirms Sinister will be moving in a more supernatural direction, bringing with it a bloodbath of modern horror clichés, including creepy kids, men in masks and occult imagery. Lone viewers are likely to see through the cheesy final act, but this is exactly the kind of film that would be eaten up by a big crowd keen for some cheap scares.Sinister does (only just) enough to keep itself out of 'B-grade schlock' territory, and is entertaining enough to keep most viewers from counting down the minutes to its admittedly brave climax, but its lack of atmosphere and abundance of familiarity make this less of a gamer changer, and more of a fun night in.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

You can never explain something like this!,"***SPOILERS*** Down on his luck and deep in debt crime writer Ellison Oswalt, Ethan Hawke, should have heeded the town sheriff's, played by ""Big"" Fred Thompson, advice and check out of the house he bought before it's too late for both him and his family. Oswalt smelling a block buster book deal, the true crime story he was planning to write, stayed and was soon to face the dire consequences of his actions. It's when Oswalt found a box of developed 8mm. film canisters together with a 1960's Bell & Howell projector to play them with that his troubles were soon to begin. And they didn't end until he and his family members ended up dead together with him!The film canisters reviled a series of horrific murders that spanned some 40 years and killed some dozen victims. What shocked Oswalt more then anything else's about these films was who in fact filmed these events! And was the person who filmed them the one who committed them as well? By the time that Oswalt found out the truth he and his family were to become the killers next victims!****SPOILERS*** The unknown killer left a calling card to every one of his crimes and even used one of the family members to do the ghastly work for him. It wasn't until Oswalt contacted Prof. Jonas, Vincent D'Onofrio, that he realized just what he was up against. An ancient Babylonian devil who was somehow conjured up by one of the person he ended up killing. Now with the cat or devil out of the bag there's no telling how many more victims this devil, called Bughuul or The Boogie Man, will rack up before his teats for human blood is finally satisfied. And it's poor Ellison Oswalt & family that are to be his next meal of burnt offering!P.S The film ""Sinster"" was made despite its's top cast for a measly $3,000,000.00 and within two months made close to $50,000,000.00 in just box office receipts alone! That's more the 15 times as much as it cost to make! Something films now a days with far far bigger budgets never even come close to making!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Chix Chat on Film Review: A creepy thrill.,"This film is definitely a new look for Ethan Hawke (Ellison Oswalt), and it was a whole lot of him. Most of the scenes consisted of Ellison drinking and freaking out. I don't recall ever having seen Mr. Hawke in a horror flick before. Actually, I would say that this tale about the mass murder of entire families was more of a creepy thriller than a horror flick. There were indeed some horrific occurrences, but I have to say that I appreciated the fact that it wasn't simply a gorefest, and that there was an actual story to be told. Ellison is a writer and in an attempt to reclaim the glory from once having had a top selling crime story, he moves his family into the home of a family that has recently been murdered. I found the fact that his wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) preferred to know as little as possible about the what, when and how of Ellison's preparation for acquiring the reference material for his new book. Not so surprising in this case ignorance is not bliss. The trailer did a good job of conveying just how creepy this film is, with the scene of Ellison's son Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario) bending over backwards out of a moving box. That little exercise in flexibility turned out to be a red herring, but it was still pretty creepy. Fortunately, there was some comic relief that came in the form of Deputy So and So (James Ransome), who was so much more helpful than one would think upon the initial meeting. It was too funny when he rattles off to Ellison exactly how he felt about moving his family into that house. The explanation of who the culprit is in this case was delivered in a plausible manner, so I had no real issues with the story telling. I knew fairly early in the story how the murders were being executed, pun intended, so there was that level of predictability. I'm so not a horror genre fan, my idea of an acceptable horror flick is Happily N'Ever After, but this film wasn't too bad to experience. A lesson learned is if you knowingly move your family into a house where the entire family was murdered and there are no leads for an arrest, then don't expect that you will have a different outcome. But hey if people could take a hint, there would be no horror stories. I give it an amber light.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
House Hunting...,"SINISTER definitely lives up to its title. It's dark and grim. Bleak, even! Those who can tolerate only happy stories with happy endings may want to move along.However, those who are sick of soppy, Hollywood horror movies, and crave unsettling, supernatural terror, are in luck.Ethan Hawke is superb as true crime author, Ellison Oswalt, who is trying to recapture his past glory after his last couple of books tanked. After settling his family into their new, questionably-chosen house, Oswalt sets out to research the latest grisly subject matter to cross his radar.While Oswalt might be hoping to put together his next bestseller, he soon faces something unexpected, unexplained, and relentlessly life-threatening.Director Scott Derrickson dials up the chills, slowly.

Satisfying suburban horror fantasy,"Although hardly a future classic, SINISTER is nevertheless among the more satisfying and sure-footed horror fantasies in the past couple of years--the equivalent of a solidly hit two-base grounder--and a major professional improvement for writer/director Scott Derrickson.Combining effects and motifs from Western and J-horror, Derrickson's script deftly turns the screws from natural mystery to supernatural as Ethan Hawke's true-crime author Ellison Oswalt delves into a cold case, only to uncover pattern killings which prove ultimately mythic. The ""suburban nightmare"" structure is strictly conventional, but contains enough twists to keep from collapsing on itself. There are a few too many red herrings, but not an egregious number.The characters aren't terribly intelligent, but they're not incapable of doing sensible things...at least, within the set-up's context. One problem with the script is that the dysfunctional marriage portrayed couldn't have lasted long enough to produce even one child (whenever Oswalt goes to another small town, researching some notorious local crime, Juliet Rylance's wife Tracy: a) insists that the whole family move with him; b) but demands that he never discuss even the topic of his work; c) then reliably freaks out to learn that the old case had been big news among the chatty new neighbors). Clearly, if she didn't require so much nuclear togetherness, his career wouldn't be an issue; indeed, the characters' whole dynamic should have been better constructed. Still, Derrickson deserves credit for creating characters with enough weight to warrant even that level of critique.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Dark and disturbing,Sinister is a spectacular and terrifying movie with a quite fresh and original concept with terrifying moments full of tension. Ethan Hawke steals much of the film in his role as a writer investigating something quite dark and macabre. It is noted that the evil entity Bughuul is heavily inspired by the Boogeyman and is a rather macabre and disturbing version of himself when his true intentions are discovered. The film also has a good setting that builds tension and the super 8 movie scenes are lurid enough to be disturbing. The soundtrack and white noise sound effects help a lot to make the atmosphere more tense. Sinister is definitely one of the best Blumhouse movies with a very good horror and suspense atmosphere guaranteed. My final rating for this movie is 9/10.,9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Now This Is a Creepy Horror Movie,"true crime author moves his family into a home where an unsolved horrific multiple murder took place and finds a stash of 8mm home movies in the attic, he believes he's found evidence of a serial killer going all the way back to the 1960s. Ethan Hawke plays Ellison Oswalt, a famous (though his fame is fading) true crime writer who has moved his family into the home where a grisly multiple murder happened. The movie actually opens with what appears to be grainy, home movie video (or film) of the crime that happened in this very home. Now, he hasn't told his wife or young family that a murder happened here You see, he's trying to write his next big (and hopefully biggest yet), book and perhaps living in the house of the crime he wants to write about may provide that inspiration. Late one night, while investigating some nocturnal noises, Ellison finds himself in the attic where he finds a stash of 8mm home movies, and a projector. Over the next few weeks/months he reviews these movies only to be led to believe he has stumbled upon the proof of a previously unknown serial killer with crimes that go back to the 1960s. Trying to get information about the crime that happened from the local chief of police isn't going to be easy as he isn't a fan of Ellison's work, as it often makes the police looked like buffoons. Luckily he is able to get an inside to the police by befriending one of the newer Deputies, who happens to be a big fan of Ellison's. Uncovering proof of other unsolved murders which seem to tie in with the scenes found on the movies he discovered in his attic. He also enlists the help of a Professor Jonas (Vincent D'Onofrio), as there are similar symbols left at the scenes of each crime scene. The more Ellison investigates, the weirder and deeper the weirdness grows. Now his own kids are seeing and doing the unexplainedDamn this is a good, creepy horror movie. Hell, it even includes what I would consider a half-decent twist! I find that the movie managed to create and sustain a level of suspense (and aforementioned creepiness) that is rare lately.

Don't waste your time or money,"This movie was horrible. Repetitive scare tactics, and a lull of a flick altogether. It had potential, but I left the theater rolling my eyes.

Sinister turned out to be a pretty good horror film,"This film is like Lords of Salem, in that I have been wanting to see it for a while and finally got the chance one night. Unlike Lords of Salem, this one was pretty good. It was not spectacular or anything and like a lot of horror films it lacks certain things and certain things are done in such a way to prevent it from being super good, but it was still an enjoyable enough horror film. It made me wonder where it was going, the acting pretty good and it had some nice creepy imagery. With that it also had plot points that went nowhere and an ending that while not completely disappointing still left me feel it was lacking and not satisfactory. Of course, compare it to most recent horror films it was greatlike Lords of Salem for instance. Sorry, but I had seen that one recently at the time of me writing this review and it just stunk on ice. Granted, it is better than all those numerous PG-13 rated flicks that populate the cinemas these days and those once a year lazy flicks that essentially have extremely small budgets and repeat the same things over and over again.The story has a true crime novelist wishing to write about a heinous crime where a family was hung and the little girl of the family is now missing. The author makes his new home the very home where this terrible crime took place. The sheriff does not like the idea of him writing about this particular crime and his wife is iffy about the circumstances as well. Of course, had the author told his wife that they had just moved into the very house where this crime took place she probably would have been way more iffy! Well, the man starts trying to connect the dots and get inside the crime, he is aided by a mysterious box full of movies that are apparently of the victims. They seem to be nothing more 'sinister' than home movies of first depicting the family during happy times, but as they progress the author sees that there is a darkness within them as soon the film shows the family being murdered. This shakes up the author, but due to his seemingly wanting to be famous once again he presses on rather than inform the authorities about his grisly find (he wrote a best seller, but has fallen on a bit of a cold streak). He soon looks deeper and finds a strange figure present during all the murders and this figure seems to be living within the film itself.So yes, one of the things that made this film good was the interesting concept. It was spooky seeing author (played by Ethan Hawke) watch the films and they did a good job making them spooky. At the same time, the film did rely a bit on clichés. In the film, the son seems to be suffering night terrors and this seemed to really go nowhere. Perhaps they were trying to surprise us when the ending came along, but certain facts were not revealed till nearly the end and thus making the son's night terrors just seem to be an almost pointless plot point. I also thought the one occultist should have been in the film more and I wish they would have let him respond to the author's query at the end.So, overall, I did enjoy the film, just a few too many flaws here and there and a few loose ends that could have used tying up. I do believe that a sequel to this one is being made; however, seeing as how the first on is now a couple of years old at least it is not going to be like Paranormal Activity or The Conjuring. Sure, Annabelle is not a direct sequel, but it is a sort of sequel that uses one aspect of that film that everyone loved and they stretched it to a full length film that took like a week to make. So here is hoping that if they do make another film they explain a bit more, but not too much. That is what happened to Phantasm, they made a film where they explained nothing and then just tried to explain it too much. I also do not wish to see the same film repeatedthey need to do some things differently. So, overall a pretty good horror film, but it contains a couple of the flaws that plague so many horror films that prevent it from being great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Marred By Its Final Act But A Chilling Experience Nonetheless,"From the director of The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Sinister marks director Scott Derrickson's second stint with the genre of horror & is an impressive improvement over his debut chiller. It might not have reached the dizzying heights of the genre masterpieces when it comes to storytelling aspects but it nonetheless accomplishes its goal of scaring the audience in a pretty impressive manner.Opening with an 8mm footage of a family being killed by an unseen figure, Sinister concerns a true-crime writer who along with his family moves into the very house where a disturbing crime once took place in order to help his research. The plot is set in motion when he discovers a cache of snuff films in the attic depicting families being murdered in various ways & ultimately ends up finding much more than he bargained for.Brilliantly directed by Derrickson, the first half of the film is ingeniously structured thanks to the excellent build-up of its premise but its second half plays spoilsport here, especially the final act, although it's not that bad enough to destroy the entire picture. The atmosphere is chilling for the most part, jump cuts are smartly used, sound & music is effectively carried out, and performances by its cast isn't much of a letdown.On an overall scale, Sinister does carry many genre-clichés throughout its runtime while also including few elements which bring the story down by a slight extent but there's less denying that it's a cinematic experience not many horror films of today are able to deliver. Arguably the scariest flick of 2012 and in my opinion the second best Hollywood horror of its year after The Cabin in the Woods, Sinister is definitely worth a shot.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Creepy enough, but really only if you're afraid of the dark","Not terrible, not great. Creepy/scary enough I guess, but really if the guy just turned the lights on once in a while, it would have lost 99% of the suspense factor. The ending wasn't so much the conclusion of the plot as it was just where the film ended, seemingly haphazardly. It was like they just ran out of film so figured ""Eh, lets just call it a day here"". Still, not as bad as so many of the films these days that call themselves ""horror films"" and really aren't.Id recommend watching with all lights off, curtains drawn and with a minimum of distractions for the full effect. If you liked this, Id also recommend VHS. That was similar in some ways but far weirder/creepier/more creative.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Sinister...but that's about it,"'Sinister' is advertised as being one of the scariest films of 2012 and it probably is, but nothing more.The acting is poor but this is due to the bad dialogue in the script. The conversations have all occurred before in countless other films, discussions can seem false and wooden throughout the whole film. Ethan Hawke does try his best to give a decent performance but it fails due to the poor script.The storyline is a bit unique; there have not been many supernatural horror movies in the past twenty years but 2012 has seen quite a few so far. The plot is scary and quite disturbing at some points, I was surprised because it's rated as a 15, personally, I think it should have been an 18. However, the plot does work it's just the dialogue that lets it down.Overall, the film will frighten most people; there are lots of jumpy scenes and quite a few creepy ones too. The films' only let down was its boring dialogue which made this film a lot worse than it should be and far more forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"This brings ""run of the mill"" to a new level.","This movie is so by-the-numbers, it's painful to watch. And you know, I actually understand clichés, and I believe a good artists must primarily know how (and why) to follow rules, but this film is basically a checklist of rules and clichés followed by the letter. List all the horror film clichés you can remember off the top of your head, and they'll all be here.I still can forgive that, though. It's okay to follow conventions when you actually have good material to deliver, and when the material is delivered skillfully. But this movie wastes every bit of potential it has. There are some fine ideas here; for some reason, I always found there was something creepy and unsettling about Super 8 films, and this movie has a tendency (a tendency!) to explore that -- both the imaginary possibilities, as well as the physical aspects (the grainy image, the sound of the projector, etc.). But at every opportunity, the interesting things are merrily exchanged for some of the most gratuitous and pointless jump scares, and some of the most obnoxiously loud scare chords. I honestly think it's time for movie directors to get a severe beating and learn to STOP USING SCARE CHORDS! Every scare chord you hear in your life is the director admitting he is TOO INCOMPETENT TO USE THE IMAGERY TO SCARE YOU. I mean, isn't cinema a visual art? Aren't the images supposed to creep you out? So why are the scare chords even there? Instead of sucking the audience into the movie, it kicks them out, it detracts from the feeling, it ruins the immersion; and the effect is gone just a few seconds later.And this is a shame, because there is some good imagery here. The ""found footage"" films are well made, but they're spoiled by some bizarrely stupid and exploitative soundtrack music (was that REALLY necessary?). But there are some ""le artistique"" scenes here that are borderline hilarious -- definitely a director trying too hard there. Also, we have to deal with Ethan Hawke's obnoxious twitching and overacting, the unnecessary ""comic relief"" character (I could see the actor was being earnest in his delivery, but that character was stupid), and other ""checklist"" moments. And why, WHY, did they have to throw Boards of Canada in this? (okay, so as a fan of Boards of Canada, it was certainly thrilling to hear Gyroscope in a movie theatre, but come on! That was a very shallow choice)I definitely can picture a GOOD version of this movie. And I get irritated with the reviews that say that ""despite the clichés, the film is good"". It's exactly that attitude that makes horror films so ridiculous: the rotten core of the horror industry is taken as a given, as an unavoidable fact. This is a shame. Instead of spending money in making those ""artistique"" effects, the director should have tried to thwart those clichés for a REAL shock.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Cinematography off the wall,"I would definitely consider this one of the best horror films ever in my opinion. I wouldn't necessarily call it scary for the most part, in fact the jump scares detract from the scaryness to me. I would however say this is one of the most unnerving movies there is. It delivers on exactly what it says it does, it's just straight up...sinister. The home videos are without a doubt the creepiest part of this film and the fact that they are all practical effects makes it all the more creepy. The grainy footage along with the out of focus Baguel is quite frankly nightmare inducing. I love this movie to no end and I'm disappointed the sequel was basically a B movie comity.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I probably shouldn't have watched this the evening after seeing The Conjuring,"I probably shouldn't have watched this the evening after seeing The Conjuring as there are similarities and that film is a much more confident and fundamentally scary movie. I understand Ethan Hawke was not only very keen to play this role but also recommended Juliet Rylance as his wife. I don't think Hawke is really up to this role which is a difficult one as he has to play by himself for much of the time. Neither do I feel there is any rapport between the two. I did like the unusual score, I loved the opening and closing credits (which really are creepy) and felt that the children were effective. Being an old 8mm buff myself, I much enjoyed the playing with these found films and the whole exciting business of editing. I was also most impressed with the 'Skype' sequences when Hawke gets to hear the views of an eccentric university professor. I thought these scenes were amazingly well done and that the film caught fire during these sequences. If only the whole film could have been run at this same tempo and level of weirdness, because it did have the potential to be as scary as The Conjuring.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The basic premise is flawed but the movie has its moments,"Sinister is a horror movie whereby a best-selling author (Ellison Oswalt) is set to write a book about the unexplained murder of a whole family and the possible abduction of one of the children in a rural Pennsylvanian neighborhood. Ellison (played by Ethan Hawke) decides (for some totally unexplained reason) to move with his wife and two young children at the same house where that family used to live (no wonder why the rent was so low).Elisson finds accidentally in the attic some unregistered 8mm videotapes depicting a series of similar murders that were also not resolved. He witnesses a number of phenomena (viewing the 8mm tapes and at his house) and starts to believe that a malevolent 'entity' (a spirit that takes a human-like form) is responsible for all the murders and tries now to possess and harm his family.The movie reminded me a lot of 'Insidious' (2010) a similar (but better) movie with the same pattern: namely, again an 'entity' tries to possess a child. In 'Sinister' it was difficult for me to come to terms with the movie's ending and the basic premise of the movie. Also a key element in the film (the 8mm films) is left 'hanging' and their presence is not given a rational (or even a metaphysical) justification. I thought it was a convenient plot device of the script that did not resonate well with what the film tried to convey. Even the decision of Ellison to rent the house where the murders took place is also a convenient plot device and nothing more. I also very much preferred the way 'Insidious' presented the 'entity'. Here it becomes simply a caricature, albeit a scary one at times.'Sinister' nonetheless has its good moments and it may satisfy some fans of horror movies. Just be aware of some very gratuitously violent scenes that honestly I do not think they were necessary and add nothing to the plot. Ethan Hawke is a very good actor and carries the movie and I could recommend the movie only for Hawke's performance here. The scenes with his wife were especially well done and very believable. A 5/10 from me.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good until the end.... trust me the ending sucks!,"Ok.... so the first half of this movie so well done with fantastic performances from everyone! This strange mystery enfolding in front of family man drives everybody to the edge of their seats, not only is the strange deity Bagul extremely creepy and causes tour spine to tingle but he is never seen from a full point. That's what makes him so scary ,illusive and dangerous the watcher is more scared when we do not see him as we don't know what he really looks like but we know he is there. That's why I think when he is shown too much he becomes less scary and with every continues jump scare of his not truly terrifying blue face springing out Lila smurf is just overdone and not scary (but I don't know I don't scare easy.)
The last 30 minutes or so of the film are entirely predictable and in no way make up for the brilliant first half of the film.

"Surprisingly, Sinister is a very satisfying horror flick","Without giving away too much of the plot, I would like to explain why Sinister might arguably be by far one of the most rewarding, and – at the same time – one of the least offensive horrors of the last year. While the fact that the main idea presented in the film is sometimes poorly executed is rather discouraging, I think that Sinister is able to overcome many of its mistakes in a rather successful fashion.First of all, I loved the way Sinister played with the concept of snuff films, making them one of the scariest and most shocking images seen during the whole movie. They add the much- needed amateurishness, so to say, and show a darker, more sinister side of the picture. Without any hesitation, they attack the audience with obscure recordings of some grizzly murders that look as disturbing and realistic as they definitely should.Second of all, the amazingly climatic music sets the mood just right for a series of abrupt and unexpected scares. These aren't just some silly cookie cutters, no. It's rather a blend of electronic tunes and an a bunch of raw sounds combined together to intensify the unnerving and sombre ambiance every time something frightening and otherworldly is about to happen.Third of all, Sinister doesn't overuse the idea of paranormal activity and nightmarish creatures as such. The weird 'thing' (too stay spoiler-free) is there, yes, but it appears only a few times in order to implement the possibility of an some mystic, occultist presence. Even though the film ultimately fails to get rid of most of its clichés, they're not really that striking and don't downgrade the overall experience. Surprisingly, even the ending is as satisfying as it is abrupt and forced.Unfortunately, the characters are rather superficial and one-dimensional, and their inability to think clearly is the film's biggest problem. For a (un) trained eye the plot might seem predictable after some time, but the people involved in the whole horrendous intrigue can't comprehended that they're in grave danger, and that moving to a house, where people got killed before isn't always a reasonable thing (the blame is on Ethan Hawke's characters, just to be clear).Sinister gives a reasonable amount of scares (although sometimes I wished for some more), and does so through a successful use of violent snuffs, grim and claustrophobic cinematography, and aforementioned distressing soundtrack. Even though Sinister doesn't really bring anything new to the table, it's both an eerie and enjoyable addition to the horror genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Quite thrilling and enjoyable supernatural offering,"Moving into a new house to get in a proper head-space for his next book, a writer and his family find themselves under attack by a strange serial killer that struck previous families in the house and that in fighting him may be more difficult than imagined when he finds out it may not be human.This here turned out to be quite decent for the most part and really above-average at times. The main thing that really hurts this one is the fact that there's just so much time going by of fiddling with the cameras and not doing much of anything here. The build-up takes far too long to get going that there's an air of boredom at times when it's just him by himself viewing the tapes, and while it does focus on the creepy images at the appropriate times the fact that there's no other true scare-inspiring device in the film beyond the home movies tends to make the whole thing go into repeat especially with the spousal arguments that continually creep up and knock this one down a bit for the feeling of extending the length because it has to. That said, there's a lot to like elsewhere in here as the tapes do get progressively creepier and creepier with their rather haunting and hypnotic images, managing to make them feel like true voyeur pieces despite the heinous actions being committed and there's a real sense of enjoyment it gets from this feeling that's quite contagious at times. The spill-over into real life with the assaults on the family make for quite a creepy telling, and the final half is just insanely good with a lot to really like there with the revelation of the murders, the crime spree in the house and the final twist which is quite good. Coupled with one of the more inventive and genuinely creepy monsters that's actually helped by his back-story and there's a lot of good stuff here to overcome the few flaws.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and extreme amounts of screen-time with children-in-jeopardy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Nice, Satisfying, and . . .","Solidly shuddery are words I would use to describe Scott Derrickson's Sinister. I measure the quality of horror flicks against The Exorcist and The Haunting and Signs, among others, and Sinister, although not in the A column, is what I'm looking for in some good journeyman cinematic scares.It would be wrong to point out that it takes too long to become emotionally invested in Sinister, that Ethan Hawke is a smidgen too shallow to like or dislike his Stephen King-like character, and the movie is one big cliché, but Sinister delivers more than enough disquiet and shocks to overlook its failings.Which brings me to the general structure of Stephen King's many novels--you know, frustrated writer with a tragic character flaw confronts demon--and Ellison Oswald is so close to many of King's character that I'm wondering if Stephen King's attorneys were breaking out the Winchesters when Sinister hit the screen.Just a thought.Anyway, I had fun with Sinister, parked in front of the TV in the bedroom, chihuahua cuddled up alongside, and . . .the lights out.Thought I'd do my part.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Nu-Metal garbage,"Love horror films? Been disenchanted with every horror movie that has been released in the last fifteen years or so (with the exception of REC, The Descent, Haute Tension, Martyrs, etc)? Don't bother with this tripe. It's awful, beyond the point of being laughable. You would have a better time watching 3 hours of Slipknot videos.Aside from containing every possible modern horror movie cliché, the main problem with the film (aside from some pretty gaping plot holes) is that it's astoundingly boring. At two hours long, this barf parade absolutely overstays its welcome. It's decently shot, decently acted, whatever -- but the film gives us absolutely no reason to care about drunk Ethan Hawke or his family. He watches some people die on Super 8 film, drinks scotch, and that's about it. Every thirty minutes we see Baghull the Demon who is Real Bad News (or something).Nothing you see in this movie matters. There's not even a single jump scare in here. This is coming from a guy who gets spooked real easily. Really, this movie plays out like a 2 hour long Disturbed video. It even features ""creepy kids"" -- wow, that really hasn't been done in a horror movie in the last two decades!

Surprisingly really great,"I've always been someone who's never really scared of 95% of horror films out there. Even when some horror films scare me, they only do it to a certain degree. So either I've turned into a total coward or this is one of those 5%, because I found myself quite unsettled and truly terrified for much of this film's running time. Much of that is because of the really atmospheric music score, which incorporates many sounds that only heighten the suspense. There hasn't been a horror score this brilliantly orchestrated or scary in a very long time.And while there are definite jump scares in this one, I think, for the most part, they truly worked. The suspense-building was unbearable at times, and the murder mystery at the core is also truly strong. You kinda see how the film will end 20 minutes before it's over, but it still had some more twists that surprised me. It does get a bit implausible, but nothing totally crazy or anything that kills the mood. This is definitely a very strong horror film backed by a pretty effective lead performance from Ethan Hawke.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"some movies that cause a visceral reaction, that lodge into your subconscious for days on end and leave a lasting scare","There are some movies that cause a visceral reaction, that lodge into your subconscious for days on end and leave a lasting scare. These movies also age well, and offer the same feeling of dread and helplessness years later. I last felt this way with the original remake Grudge of 2004, to the point of sleeplessness for days. Since then I became immune to horror as it's a steady diet of ours, but Sinister scarred again and opened old terrors, even after a rewatch years apart.The movie disturbs on multiple levels, particularly in the thought that innocent kids can be turned into monsters of unimaginable cruelty, a sad parallel to the world today. In the case of Sinister it's particularly terrifying to imagine what ancient evils and demons lurk amongst us, silently moving from one victim family to another. Just how many crimes go unexplained and filed away into cold case status, with supernatural aspects that no one wishes to root cause or cure.The found footage aspect of Sinister is heart chilling, the cold methodical way in which entire families are put to death.

If you found footage on Super 8 in your attic would you play it?...,"Exposition, it's important and Sinister gets to it right from the off. I mention this because if Saw or Hostel are your bag then maybe this one won't suit, but if you like a good thriller with added chills then you're at the right movie.Established but hasn't had a hit for a while author Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) is moving his family to a new home to research a true crime case that he hopes will get him back on the best sellers list. A disturbing series of murders linked to the house provide the backdrop for the research but things take a supernatural turn when a mysterious box of Super 8 found footage is discovered in the loftAppearing in the images is a figure which with further investigation with the help of a University professor is identified as Bughuul and things here take a turn for the occult. Curiosity drives Ellison further into this angle of the investigation to the point of obsession as he tries to find out what happened to the previous occupants of the house but the deeper he delves it becomes all too apparent that some things should be left well alone and the proverbial cat is in mortal danger.The mood of the film is incredibly tense with more than one nod to Kubrick's Shining. It's a slow burner with the viewer being taken along for the ride with the knowledge that the brakes are shot here and the ledge is fast approaching but, like Ellison you really want to know the answers even though all logic suggests leave it alone now.It's a credit to the Scott Derrickson that the characters are fleshed out and we can empathise with them even in the circumstances that prevail. So often in horrors this is not the case and it can be hard to care about people you know nothing about when they are in peril merely for effect.Ethan Hawke does a great job of conveying the author desperate for all the trappings of success for a second time around and (you can't help but think if he could just settle for a teaching gig somewhere his life would be less hazardous) but he is driven and ambitious and downright stubborn, ambition and integrity now giving way to greed and recognition. His wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) has pretty much had enough of chasing the dream too but is ever supportive and a bloody heavy sleeper considering the things that go bang in the night in the house. A dark and warped soundtrack by Christopher Young adds to the horror as it unfolds and the performances solidify the tension, especially from the younger members of the cast. There are a few jump out of your seat moments and also more subtle, uncomfortable viewings of the super 8 footage that put a horrendous spin on the found footage narrative where you can't help but watch for clues with Ellison as they sear off the screen.In a perfect world the build up to the film could have been a little more secretive ideally, as trailer footage can unfortunately give the audience major deja vu when a couple of scenes are building to a big scare you'll have seen it already but there are plenty more where they came from.All in all an effective and tense thriller that will have some of you sleeping with the lights on for a couple of nights and a new found fear of attic space!More reviews at wherewolftherewolf.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

How to ruin your movie,"Sinister starts out promising, the first scene is actually great, is a scene I actually remember after more than a year I watched this movie.

The cinematography is good, I like the stationary feel of the camera in most of the movie, and most of the Super 8 segments are creepy, the first one being the best. The score is quite decent, it is very subtle and it fits well.

"Blood Drawings, Creepy Kids, and Ghoul-Masks Softly Lit by an iPhone","Few horror films are bold enough to not only root their cause of frights in an obsession with screens – both the computer and cinema variety – but also incriminate audiences (by proxy) as predominantly responsible for horrific happenings through their inability to tear their gaze away. Such audacious self-reflexivity should be difficult to execute without the film unraveling, but director Scott Derrickson instead alludes to recent genre trends erring towards 'found footage, documentary style realism', without skimping on the old-school supernatural scares and jumps. As such, Sinister cannily blends 'old and new', a post-Paranormal Activity thriller unafraid to exploit the genre's roots in melodrama and excess.Indeed, Derrickson, like his first foray into horror, 2005's The Exorcism of Emily Rose, proves adept at marinating in genre conventions while subtly riffing on them to tweak expectations just enough. The premise (a 'true crime' writer who moves his family into the house of the recent murder victims whose case he is documenting discovers a box of 'home movies' that suggest a chain of interconnected serial family murders) is just outlandish enough to be original, yet just grounded enough to fly.Equally, Sinister flourishes atmospherically, with its scores of documented murders adopting a surreal, grotesque beauty, rendered operatic through Christopher Young's exquisitely cacophonous musical score. Anchored through Ethan Hawke's magnetic, jittery performance and a couple of refreshing plot twists where (gasp!) characters actually result to horrific happenings sensibly, Derrickson nonetheless quashes such baited hope through an unflinching fatalism. Sinister's horror is fast, furious and relentless, and sure to spook hardened horror-vets and casual thrill-seekers alike.-7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the more decent horrors out there.,"""Sinister"" movie reviewAs a fan of the horror genre, as soon as I saw the trailer for the movie 'Sinister', I decided I would have to see it. I'd never heard of any of the stars, but the premise of the film seemed interesting, and the trailer had a very creepy vibe to it.I went to see this movie at the cinema (on Halloween and on Screen 13, coincidence?). It was the first, and at the moment, only horror I've seen on the big screen, so I was excited to see if this enhanced the experience.In short, this movie terrified me. Some scenes left me hiding behind my jacket with my fingers in my ears crying like a toddler. I felt genuine fear and dread watching this movie, as I spent the entirety of it expecting something terrifying to happen. Something I despise about most horrors (modern ones especially) is when a jump-scare is built up to (or the classic build up, but nothing happens) but there were moments in this film where jump-scares were so spontaneous they had me literally leaping from my seat. Obviously, it does have some built up jump-scares, but even these are effective. One that will always stick with my mind is the scene where we see a lawnmower going along some grass, accompanied by silence. Obviously something is about to happen any time now. It goes on for so long, the tension makes it truly terrifying, and when the scare hits, prepare for a full on brown pants moment.The story of the movie is interesting to say the least. I won't go into too much detail in case you haven't seen it, so here's a brief overview. The film opens with a shot of a family hanging (morbid I know) but this is a great example of foreshadowing. Crime writer Ellison into home of the family we saw hanging with his wife and their two children, one of which begins experiencing bizarre night terrors upon moving into the home. Only Ellison knows about what happened at the home, he intends to use the murders as the basis for his new book, and hopes that his research will turn up the fate of the family's fifth member, a little girl who disappeared following the murders. He finds a box in the attic containing a projector and several pieces of footage that are each labelled as innocent home movies. As he watches the films, he discovers that they shows families being murdered in various ways including the hanging that opened the movie. He notices a strange figure in one of the films, and then realises the figure is in all of the films, watching over the murders along with a strange symbol. With the films he discovers childish drawings depicting the murders, along with crude sketches of the demonic figure, identified as ""Mr Boogie"". He consults a local police officer and discovers that the murders shown in the films took place at different times, beginning in the 1960s, and in different cities across the country. He also learns that the families were all drugged before being killed; and that a child from each family went missing following every murder.I'll leave it there and let you watch the rest of the film for yourself. The story is consistently interesting throughout and genuinely captivating. The ending becomes fairly predictable as you get further into the film, and yes, they've done the classic horror movie cliché and left it open for a sequel (Which I can only imagine will be exactly the same as this movie if it's ever made). The acting is also good, with Ethan Hawke providing a very believable role, even when it's just him and a projector on screen, we really feel as vulnerable as his character is.Now for the criticisms. The worst part of this movie is the trailer, it reveals way, way too much about the plot, and shows off lots of the jump-scares (I can only assume the majority of the people in the cinema had not seen the trailer, because people were still terrified by these moments.) So if you haven't seen the trailer and intend to watch this movie, do not watch the trailer. My only other complaint would be the venue. As I said, this is the first horror film I saw at the cinema, and after buying the movie on DVD, I wasn't scared at all watching it a second time. I've narrowed it down to 2 possibilities of why this happened. 1. Because I've seen it all before. 2. Because I was constantly waiting for a really loud noise and something to flash in front of the giant screen. Thinking back, the reason I jumped so much at some scares may have just been because of how loud the cinema was. See for yourself I guess.My rating for ""Sinister"": 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Best horror movie I've seen in the longest!,"I was kind of skeptical when I read the plot of this movie. But after watching it, I changed my mind. This movie is great, something different. This movie has a twist of basically everything. Honestly this is how horror films should be. It has you in the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next. But the good thing is that nothing ever happens when you expect it to. It keeps you guessing, honestly I love this movie and I'm a big horror fan. I can actually say this is one of the best horror films made. If you get a chance to watch this movie, go ahead and watch it ASAP. You won't regret watching it, but you might have nightmares.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A good movie if you aren't hung up on the details.,"So yes, makeup could have been better, but who cares? It had me feeling that tightness in my chest and my heart picking up the pace that I love about horror movies. It has some really good scares in it, and I loved the ending! So many people found in lacking and I'm not sure why. The films were freaky and during some scenes of the movie I was holding my breath. And, OK, yes, there were a few scares that you could see coming thanks to the trailers, but overall it left me feeling unsettled and at times uncomfortable. A horror film isn't doing its job if you are relaxed and enjoying. The suspense lasted throughout the whole film.For the hardcore horror fans whom need everything to be plausible and realistic- not the film for you. But if you enjoy creepy films and tense scenes, you may enjoy this movie. Overall I thought it was good.

One of the best horror movies of 2012,"This is one of the best horror movies I've seen in forever. I've seen every single horror movie and NONE are like this. It has a good climax, beginning, and everything. I have never seen a movie with a plot like this one. Its scary but still has a life to it and makes you care about the characters. Its got a very surprising ending to it that you will never see coming. It's not just plain stupidity. Definitely would watch it a million times and never get bored. It just builds and builds and its non stop fun. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"Sinister?  Yes, but not in a good way","This movie is eerie, spooky, and creepy but never scary. I suppose that it's good that the main character, Ellison, was a true crime writer so that the viewers could be duly clued in on what was going on. In an attempt to write another best-seller, Ellison moved his family into the home where the subjects of his next book were killed.Layer by layer, super 8 film by super 8 film the story unfolded but to me it never amounted to more than a malevolent drama. There were never any real shocks or surprises and nor was there any real frightening moments. The movie is OK. The movie will keep you tense with the musical scores and the cliché unexplained-noises-investigations-in-the-dark. But in the end many of those tense moments were met with disappointment.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Positively creepy and thrilling, but not without some major flaws","It's quite frustrating being a horror fan. Most of us have grown up watching scary movies, loving the feeling of getting so scared you couldn't fall asleep at night. However, as a kid it is much easier getting scared. The older you get the more you get accostumed with the genre and its thrills. You start to see patterns and the formula wears thin before too long. Horror movies that start off as promising as ""Sinister"" in its first hour are extremely seldom and when they do come along, our fan hearts jump.It's not that Scott Derrickson's movie is all that original. Actually, it's more or less another found footage movie with some creepy kids thrown in (more about that later), but the director sets it up so well that you find yourself creeped out and intrigued right from the start. Ethan Hawke's character is given enough depth that we can somehow understand why he would not be taking his family and running away as far as possible within the first five minutes. Derrickson moves things along at exactly the right pace and stays away from cheap scares . The dark house that serves as a setting for most of the film adds a lot of tension, and you never feel safe watching the screen and the movie stays relentlessly tense throughout. Like most good horror movies (see also The Omen, The Ring, In The Mouth Of Madness) there's a mystery that builds up to the horror, like Derrikson had his hand on some kind of scary lever and he kept turning it up with sadistic delight.This very good start makes it all the more frustrating when Derrickson makes some painful choices in the last third. You know you'e in trouble when creepy kids starts to appear. Too many people making horror movies seem to think that kids are really creepy per se (probably due in part to some of those movies mentioned above). The fact is, they're not, not in this movie at least. These kids are so obviously excited child actors with bad make-up on. As soon as the movie starts to rely on them, you know you can relax. It's like that moment in ""Say Anything"" when John Cusack and whatshername are tense on a plane until they see the seat belt sign go off and they know there's nothing to fear anymore. We know from this moment that things aren't going to get any scarier and it really kills the movies momentum. It doesn't help that Derrickson throws in some of those scares where a big creepy face pops up directly in front of the camera. We've all been victim to this on the internet when we're tricked into concentrating on an image on the screen and all of a sudden some terrible monster face appears and almost makes you soil your pants. That's okay for the internet, in a movie it's awfully uncreative and lame, and although you probably will jump at those scenes, the feeling will be followed by immediate annoyance and disappointment.The second, any maybe even bigger problem, is that the movie doesn't have a third act. As in one of Derrickson's previous movies, ""The Exorcism Of Emily Rose"", the director doesn't seem to know how to end the movie. Just like in ""Emily Rose"" the final act cannot live up to the great set up that preceded it. The movie ends really quickly without a huge revelation or a big fight or anything. It just ends and leaves you feeling disappointment.All that doesn't make ""Sinister"" a failure. In fact, this is probably the best horror movie I've seen all year (not that there's been a lot of competition). It's just a pity that Derrickson couldn't hold up the high quality throughout the movie's entire running time, because then this could have been one of the rare examples of a horror film that satisfies even hard boiled fans of the genre. ""Sinister"" does make one look forward to Derrickson's next problem, although one can only hope that the man will soon learn how to give his films proper endings.(Piece of advice: If you can, avoid the trailers before watching ""Sinister"", as most of the highlights are given away. It surely ruined a lot of fun for me, when I watched the movie and was already familiar with the best bits.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the best horror films of the 2010's!,"When ""Sinister"" was released in 2012, I was not convinced to watch it on the screen cinema, but it was a great surprise! The 2000's were a decade full of bad remakes of classic horror films and early 2010's were full of bad remakes too, but ""Sinister"" was a refleshing movie: the script was really good, the film direction is awesome and creepy, the actings are cool and the cinematography is perfect. The story is scary as hell, your skin crawls with this demon and his kids with home movies!

A solid horror movie with a creepy atmosphere,"This movie was deeply unsettling.Now before I go any further, just know that this isn't a great movie. It's full of clichés and it isn't very original. I'm not going to pretend like it's a masterpiece, because its not. While it is unoriginal and clichéd, it makes up for it with, good acting (namely Ethan Hawke), a very tense atmosphere, and creepy imagery. The sequences of Ethan Hawke watching the Super 8 films really did get to me and I had a strong urge to look away. For about a week after I watched it, I would freak myself out by thinking about this movie and I wasn't thinking about it on purpose.

Late night Netflix watch.,"A few months back, I saw ""The Apparition"" and ""The Possession"" - two would-be horror films that were so utterly boring and generic that they blur together to the point that I now struggle to remember what detail belonged to which film. I suspect in three months time I will be saying the same thing about ""Sinister"". As mainstream US horror movies go, Scott Derrickson first gained attention with the success of ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" and then the widely disliked remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still.""The film follows true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) as he discovers a box of home movies that puts his family in eminent danger. Ellison Oswalt moves himself and his family into a house where a horrific crime took place earlier, but his family doesn't know. He is trying to find out more about the crime so he can write a new book about it to help his flailing career. He uses some ""snuff"" film that he finds which show the crimes to help in his research, but he soon finds more than he bargained for. Some credit is due for an intriguing twist to the central concept, blending what's happening in the reels with the actual action on-screen. This is what provides the film's best jump-out-of-your-seat moments, with Hawke giving a solid lead performance as the ""cardigan-clad"" Ellison.Unfortunately, the film become less effective and more predictable as the film's narrative meanders on of just more of the same. Day turns to night, the projector film rolls, creepy noises are coming from the attic, and it's time to go investigate. The best spook house flicks offer credible reasons why the family stay in such a terrifying environment. Yet ""Sinister"" struggles to convince us. It takes sometime to determine if you are watching a film about the mundane activities of a killer, or a haunted house story as the film seems to wander aimlessly. Hawke is subjected to horrific experiences yet unbelievably brushes them off. He keeps it all from his family which is some feat given the loud racket every night which his wife happily sleeps through. Nothing groundbreaking here, but as a late night watch on Netflix, you'll get what you are expecting.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A total waste of time,"In the 1st 5 mins of Sinister you will know who the killer is. The next 105 mins you will spend killing time until the movie reaches it's obvious conclusion.Despite the acting being above average, the needless over acting is irritating to say the least. Hawke desperately overplays his part with embarrassing outbursts of poorly timed, needless, intensity that detract away from his role. The kids used in this are simply horrible and should never work again.There is nothing in this film you have not seen done 10 times better before. It tries very hard to cram as many phobias as possible into it's dismal 110 min run, failing on every level. if you want to see the shining, children of the corn, killer clowns from out of space, rec, etc, go and see them...they are all better films",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
America's Creepiest Home Videos,"""Sinister"" has been waiting in my watch queue for quite a while now, but for a variety of reasons I always postponed my viewing. On one hand I had really high hopes that the film would be worthwhile, since I read several praising reviews from people, or in magazines and on websites, that I usually find very reliable and with tastes similar to mine. But on the other hand this still is a primarily mainstream film that almost purely exists of clichés and tries a little too desperately to obtain a passable rating R. So what's the final verdict? ""Sinister"" honestly is one of the better and scarier horror films of the last 10 to 15 years, but that's almost solely thanks to the genuinely disturbing and nightmarish super-8 home movies that are integrally shown throughout the movie. As stated already, the plot as well as the setting and the character drawings are derivative and clichéd. Ellison Oswalt is a true-crime writer, but it's been more than a decade since he scored the huge bestseller hit ""Kentucky Blood"". In his exaggeratedly fanatic search to surpass that success, he moves with his family into a house where – unbeknown to his wife and children – a horrible and still unsolved tragedy took place. So far, it's all routine and familiar stuff The local sheriff tries to chase them away, Oswalt's marriage is under a lot of pressure because of his professional stress and drinking problem and his children suffer from nightmares in their new surroundings. But then our writer stumbles upon a box full of uncanny old-fashioned super-8 home videos in the attic and THEY undeniably form the eminence of ""Sinister"". Every self-respecting horror fanatic will consider these videos little masterpieces in their own right: shocking, morbid, raw and yet impossible to turn away from. The videos depict the gruesome murder of the family in whose house Oswalt is now living with his family, but also the sick murders of several other once happy families all over the United States. By the time that Oswalt discovers the truth of who (or what) is behind these vile massacres and who filmed them, the fate of his own family is already sealed Ethan Hawke does a terrific and mature job carrying the film, Scott Derrickson's direction is more than competent and the ice cold & spooky soundtrack contributes a lot to the tension and atmosphere as well. But still, like I assume every horror fan with me, I personally just kept looking forward to the each showing of the next super-8 video and didn't care all that much about the supernatural explanation connecting them. These little short films ought to be released separately on DVD, as far as I'm concerned, as every single one of them is a parental nightmare captured on film. Loving family scenes degenerate into harrowing killings, now that is horror! IF only the script didn't revert to ancient mythologies to provide clarification and IF only the producers would have had the guts to make the murders explicit and brutal instead of suggestive, well than ""Sinister"" would have been the greatest genre hit of the new millennium.

Excellent film,"I'm not sure why some people have given this film bad reviews, if you liked Insidious then this will appeal. I saw this at home and wished I'd have seen it at the cinema. I like my horror's American and foreign, I also like the more clever horror's without the age old heroin making silly decisions which would not happen in real life. Warning this review may contain spoilers!! Firstly the acting from the main character is good, admittedly the wife and police officer are lousy in places but I don't think it matters really. After all the story isn't about them and they don't really appear much. The story centres around a struggling writer who is trying to write a new best seller about a family who were murdered, he moves into their old house with his family. He finds a box of old super 8 films in the attic and a projector, he of course views them and sees that they are all about family murders which date back to the 1960's. The films themselves were suitably creepy and very well done. The lawnmower one in particular was a jumper! The plot was nice, not too complicated but interesting enough, the end twist was nicely done. I was pleasantly surprised that the film made me jump a few times and that doesn't often happen. In fact the only other which did was Insidious. This is one of what seems to be a new genre of film which get back to good old creeps and jumps. Not a moment too soon for me! Slasher films have been done to death and the creepy paranormal films in my view are the one's which stay with you the longest and make you not want to go upstairs into the dark.All in all a very good film, could not have been more impressed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

makes the paranormal activities look like dog crap,"this film had a lot of hype and I'm a huge horror fan. i thought the paranormal activity movies were okay but now they keep dragging the franchise on and on and i bet number 4 will be dreadful. Insidious i thought was a lot scarier then the paranormal activities and a much better film but it was still the same e thing, jump scares! this i think is cheap horror. so going onto sinister yes this film does have some paranormal activity characteristics and jump scares but this film is also mentally disturbing and unnerving. the film raised the bar for horror films and i don't remember a film being this disturbing. yes it has jump scares but they are a hell of a lot scarier than the jump scares you get in any 21st century horror film. what i most liked about the film is it had elements of old horror where you don't get to actually see the killings and it is left to your imagination. its not quite unique but it is disturbing and very clever. if you are a horror movie fan go and see it please. it should not have been a 15 it should have been an 18 to be honest. the acting is also good in this film especially Hawk's performance. don't expect this to be another paranormal activity because it isn't. its much scarier and gets into your mind much more.i will rate this film 8/10 because the story builds(although quite slow) and it was more disturbing than jumpy which i very much liked. it scared me a lot this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Terrifying from the get go!,"From my personal experience, there are essentially two types of true horror movies – best described as 'sinkers' and 'jumpers'. SINISTER manages a rare feat in that it will cruelly weigh you down into your seat with its undeniably chilling atmosphere. And just when you think you can't sink any further, the film will throw you some well-timed moments of sheer fright that will launch you off your seat.Any fan of the genre will find the beginning clichéd with all the trappings of some classic horror films of yesteryears. Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) is a non-fiction crime writer whose previous book has brought him fame and fortune by detailing some gruesome homicides in a manner that questions the competence of law enforcement personnel. As expected, Ellison does not receive a warm welcome when he moves into a new house with his wife and two children. The local Sheriff (Fred Thompson) warns the Oswalts that the house has seen better years, but only Ellison knows that their new home was the scene of a multiple homicide, where the previous family was hanged to death. Looking for inspiration on his new book, Ellison finds it in a box of super-8 film footage; five in all. Each film depicts the hideous deaths of different families in various locations, including the family that was killed in the house before the Oswalts moved in. As Ellison becomes obsessed with the footage, his family slips into utter chaos with terrifying consequences; but this is where the clichés end. Through close scrutiny, Ellison discovers a link threading all five murders – an unsettling demonic presence that seems to be reaching out from within the films.Right from the title, the director works towards delivering his promise. This is a scary film in part or whole, depending on how experienced you are as a horror fan. Believe me, there is something for everyone; even the hardest of skeptics. Aiding the plot is strong character build-up by Hawke, and as the film progresses, Juliet Rylance as Ellison's wife Tracy. Hawke is convincing as a crime-writer with an appetite for fame. There is an amusing confrontation when Tracy discovers Ellison's true motive behind moving into the new house. This is Rylance's moment, delivering with the fierceness of a protective mother who has only just realised the dangerous consequences of her husband's stupidity, even though they are sitting on a goldmine of a story.It is no secret that the horror genre is dying. This is because film makers, and screen writers for that matter, are always searching for the next best way to scare an unsuspecting audience – 'Unsuspecting' being the key word. Inspired by paralysing horror films like THE RING and INSIDIOUS, director Scott Derrickson uses C. Robert Cargill's screenplay to maximum knee-jerking effect. Yes, there are moments that allow the viewer to cower in preparation for a frightening jolt, but Derrickson's nuance is in those unnerving moments that seem to reach out to the viewer directly, while oblivious to the on-screen character. Watch out for these scenes where things happen off-centre but extremely intentional in spooking you. Blink and you might miss it, but Derrickson has thrown in quite a few of these scenes just in case you blink a lot!Despite its faults towards the end, there is a lot to like about SINISTER. Even if you end up watching this movie by peeping through your fingers, there is mystery, murder and mayhem and it all leads to a morbid twist you won't see coming. Oh, and one more thing, the soundtrack is dreadful, in a ghastly way. It's as if Derrickson recorded the wailing of tormented souls and played it back just for kicks. You have been warned.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Pretty creepy and well done,"Many people prefer to describe movies in their reviews. Many reviews give away spoilers or plot summaries. I prefer to explain why I rate a movie the way I do. I break it down into three categories. With IMDb we have 10 stars to work with. I assign 0-3 stars to each category. If I give it 3 stars in all categories, then I optionally give it an additional star for a perfect 10.1) Story: The story in Sinister gets two stars. I enjoyed the mystery, suspense without too much gore. The ending surprised me, which is rare for most horror movies. I came very close to giving this movie three stars for story.2) Acting: The acting gets two stars. All the actors in Sinister did a good job. Ethan Hawk was good as he usually is. Even the children and minor characters did a good job. Just a couple of minor actors could have been better cast.3) Cinematography: Cinematography gets a three here. I loved the 8mm film that the antagonist uses. The movie plays very dark on TV but not so dark that you can't see what's going on. They didn't overdo the creepy scenes with ghosts or whatever they were. For a horror movie, the suspenseful moments fit well and there were no black cats jumping out necessarily.Overall, I highly recommend this movie if you like good intelligent horror movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Scary, disturbing, and well-written: A horror movie for the decade","I have been waiting to see Sinister since the first buzz about it at the SXSW festival. I finally saw it and it fulfilled most of my expectations.Horror movies are made of different traditions and styles. You have those with creepy atmosphere, those with disturbing imagery, or those with scares-that-go-bump-in-the- night. Sinister is one of the few that reaches a consistent mix of all the elements. In the movie, a true-crime writer moves into a house where a family was killed, and founds a box of super8 reels that depict that murder, as well as others. The super8 movies provide the ""disturbing imagery"" part of Sinister, and they are truly chilling and unsettling. Hidden in the footage, the writer finds glimpses of a mysterious figure, and his investigation suddenly turns into a nightmare for him and his own family. That's where the ""creepy atmosphere"" sets in. And, as his investigation progresses, you have plenty of sudden scares and jumps.Thanks to an amazing camera work, a skillful direction, and an a perfect (and slightly atypical for horror flicks) soundtrack, Sinister manages to be extremely effective in delivering all of these different shades of horror. Sinister also has a quality that most horror movies lack: It is actually well written. Some reviewers have gone at great lengths in pointing out supposed inconsistencies, but, as far as I can tell, they have all misunderstood several plot points. For instance, a few reviewers ridiculed the fact that the main character wonders in his house without turning the lights on---but, in the movie, it is explained that the electric circuits are off. If you pay attention, every action is explained. In fact, it is refreshing to see an horror movie that doesn't feel half-backed, and where characters act consequentially.One of Sinister's writers was a former movie critic (at Ain't It Cool News), and his love for the genre (strong as it needs to be in a fan, but sophisticated as it needs to be in critic) comes through. The quality of its writing is apparent in the smoothness of the final product. Most horror movies tend to be discontinuous and uneven. For instance, before getting to the interesting part of ""Paranormal Activity"", you need to get through a lengthy and cumbersome introduction. And ""Insidious"", after a fantastic first half, ends with a predictable and awkward second act. Sinister, instead, proceeds evenly, pacing its scares, revealing important clues at the proper time, and giving equal attention to the buildup of the situations as well as their resolution.Part of this strength comes from the fact that the movie's concept, while not entirely original, is well thought out. The metaphor of the ""evil force"" that lives inside the world of images is better developed here than in (for instance) ""The ring"", and does not fill shoe-horned as a metaphor for horror movies themselves.The last strength of the movie that I want to mention is Ethan Hawke's exceptional performance. Hawke is truly believable as the writer obsessed with finding one last great story to tell---and eventually getting more than what he asked for. He succeeds in making his character complex and credible, and in making the viewers care for and identify with him. I am hard press to find a similarly convincing performance in a horror movie, besides George C. Scott in ""The Changeling"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Take the sweater off already,"Ethan again proves that he is lazy in acting, the writers if you can call them that put together this idea in probably a study hall, just terrible but amusing to laugh at how bad it really was ... only bright point, and not the DP work, was the wife's acting.

Gripping from Inception to Closing Credits,"Sinister is the horror film of the year, perhaps the decade. It redefines the horror genre. This film merges edge-of-your-seat suspense and an intelligent script to provide a masterpiece of the macabre. Ethan Hawke shines as the true-crime novelist looking for his next NY Times Bestseller. The story eerily unfolds and before you know it, you're reeled into a world you can't escape from. What ensues is a plunge into the deepest, darkest depths of hell.

Sinister Vibes Save This Film from Bouts of Boredom,"I took a chance with SINISTER because the trailers reminded me a bit of INSIDIOUS (one of the better recent horror movies) and because the initial reviews were curiously positive. Ethan Hawke is a talented actor and the trailer was pretty creepy. I would love to say it met my expectations and, at first, I suppose it did. My first viewing left me a nice creepy vibe but future viewings left me feeling a little bored. Not just because I knew the story and the final plot ""twist"". I knew that before I ever sat down to watch the movie because of some careless reviewers. After some thought, I realized it was because SINISTER is pretty drawn out. Writer/director Scott Derrickson and cinematographer Chris Norr have mastered creating a (no pun intended) sinister atmosphere but the movie suffers from a weak script. The movie is about a true crime novelist, Ellison Oswalt (Hawke), who moves his family into the home of a family that was brutally murdered under mysterious circumstances. Ellison uses the environment of the home to help inspire his writing while keeping his wife and kids oblivious to the fate of the home's previous tenants. He believes he's hit the mother-load when he discovers a box of old 8mm home movies in the attic. To Ellison's surprise, these are more than your average home video footagethey're a series of snuff films detailing the gruesome murders of five families. Ellison becomes obsessed with his study of the films, eager to find a missing clue as to the person behind these acts, and he uncovers a terrifying secretthat was sort of ruined in the trailers anyway.SINISTER is a fun enough movie the first time you watch it. Even knowing the big reveal at the end, Derrickson and Norr have put together one of the creepiest movies I've seen. Most of the credit really goes to the film's music. Seriously, SINISTER has the eeriest soundtrack: part music, part ambient sound, and totally chillingespecially when paired with near total silence and the click of an 8mm projector. The snuff films are the scariest part of the film. I suppose that should go without saying. Anyway, the snuff films in this movie are done incredibly well. When combined with the minimalist soundtrack, the films (shot in actual 8mm) are haunting. SINISTER jumps right in from the very beginning with one of it's most powerful images: a family of four stand beneath a massive tree with hoods over their faces and nooses around their necks while an unseen force slowly saws away at a mammoth tree branch on the other side. Once that branch is loosed, the counterweight lifts the family off their feet and we watch them kick and struggle for a minute before finally going still. It's incredibly effective and sets the tone of the movie perfectly. The rest of the snuff films are at least as effective and give the movie its most unsettling moments. It's just a shame the rest of the movie doesn't really keep that vibe alive.The real problem with SINISTER is how it bounces between horror/thriller and mystery. The horror elements, for the most part, do their job well. The mystery elements, not so much. A lot of the film is Ethan Hawke's Ellison as he investigates the snuff films and slowly pieces together the bigger picture. Unfortunately for SINISTER, that's where the movie starts to lose momentum. After we've seen the snuff films a few times, the effect diminishes a bit and all we're left with is Ellison playing detective. This mostly consists of Ellison being awoken in the middle of the night, experiencing something creepy, then waking up the next morning and watching the movies again with a bottle of booze and a notepad. Once you go through the cycle a few times, you just want the movie to move on to the next bit of scares. The whole supernatural element (effectively ruined in the trailers with Vincent D'Onofrio giving us the exposition via Skype) arrives in full about halfway through the movie and comes to a climax well past the point where I stopped caring. The ending is a little too predictable and might be determined well in advance by some viewers, but it plays out pretty nicely in the final 5 to 10 minutes of the movie. Ethan Hawke is great despite the little he has to work with, but his supporting cast drop the ball. Juliet Rylance is a little tooemotive. I know it's weird to claim an actress too emotive, seeing as how creating emotion is the name of their game. She doesn't quite ham it up but she comes on a little too strong. Either too happy or too angry, never quite right for the scene. Her performances reminds me of something from TV family drama; it doesn't fit well here. Ellison's kids don't get much to do, so that leaves our only other supporting cast as James Ransone as Deputy So-n-So. The deputy avoids the usual pitfall as a cop in a horror film by maintaining a good head on his shoulders. He actually becomes Ellison's voice of reason once the weirdness goes to the good author's head. Still, the deputy is mostly around to advance the story with new discoveries and guide us to the final haunting sequence.SINISTER is not a 'great' movie but it does deserve the chance to work its creepiness on you. When you watch this movie, in an effort to get the most from the experience, watch it in a dim room with minimal background noise. Let it establish it's atmosphere and draw you in. It's good for some chills and maybe a jump scare or two. Outside of that, SINISTER might find itself doomed to be forgotten as a movie in the dreaded category of ""not bad, but not great.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
very scary,"I'm not a big scary movie buff or ""expert"" like some people that write reviews seem to think of themselves but I will go out and say that this movie was GREAT! Some people claim they always knew when something scary was gonna happen and that it was predictable and blah blah blah but I think more that 90% of people know when something scary will happen (the music in the movies always hint to it), the point is that every scene was a build up to the ultimate climax and every time the movie hinted that something scary was gonna happen i wanted to look away but couldn't, i had to feel the chills in the back of my head and then feel them there for a good ten seconds after a scary scene was over, honestly it is a scary experience, especially if you sit down and enjoy the movie instead of sitting down and analyzing the movie and then comparing it to other movies you've seen before and doing all those things that unhappy people do to think they're staying a step ahead of the movie.........in other words just enjoy a great movie with great acting by everyone and a lot of chills throughout, it's not just a scary movie but it has a mystery factor to it so you're brain is always trying to figure out what's gonna happen next and why, enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Slow and dull most of the time, and too much Hawke's solo","The start is quite promising as viewers obtain the information about real murders from the past - through snuff films found; rather intriguing matters, but then everything slows down and strange supernatural backgrounds and side-lines appear, including trivial marks of horror movies. I am still perplexed that wind, noises in old houses, psychological stress etc can still be perceived as horror attracting attention and praise. Well, you can use some of those elements from time to time, but not to fill the whole movie with them - and repeatedly. The are constant signs that something would happen - but alas...Luckily I watched it on DVD, thus I could use forward function. And I did... lots of times. It is not a total flop thanks to Hawke's performance only. And last but not least: virtually, its poster reveals the killer :)",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Well.....,"...first,do not read other ppl's opinions.Just watch a movie.Turn of the light, turn up the volume.I did that and i liked it so much.I don't care if someone said that character made bad decisions or the character of Elison is just dumb because he moved into a house where family is killed. I MEAN...WTF ?!!!Relax, its just a movie and a plot to bring you in it.To make you entertained...So, just watch one of the best horror movies ever. (my opinion, i didn't bother listening to ppl good or bad opinions.)A great chiller is a roller-coaster ride of emotions, with a perfect combination of goosebumps, frights, and a ghoulish story. Sinister is one of those rare scary tales where the story is just as compelling as its shock value. It's the perfect combination of modern filmmaking and age-old traditions. It doesn't rush into the scares. No, it lingers on open spaces. It anticipates your expectations. And, oh yes, there is often a payoff. Sometimes when you expect it. Sometimes when you least expect it. No doubt about it, Sinister –deserving of its name– will make your skin crawl... 4 real !!!And, yes, Sinister wont be Sinister if it didn't had great spine-chilling soundtrack !!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Far from the best or worst or scariest horror film you'll see,"Ethan Hawke usually makes good movie choices so on that basis, and that of many emphatic reviews, Sinister appeared a worthy way to while away a couple hours.Well, it was and it wasn't.The early 2010's saw a slew of new horror franchises emerge, such as The Conjuring, Woman in Black and Insidious tropes. Where Sinister falls down in my opinion is that, as much as the premise is strong and original as could be these days, most of the film is devoid of any real and present danger. And therefore the hair-standing-up-on-the-back-of-your-neck moments are few and far between until the finale.One can't help feel in the capable hands of say, James Wan and Leigh Wannell (Insidious), Sinister might have better embodied its title. The creepy super-8 videos in the crime writer's (Ethan Hawke as Ellison Oswalt) possession are well crafted (a nod to the film's inspiration, The Ring, I suspect), however the sense of an existential threat to the protagonist, and his family, living at the scene of a horrendous crime, remains curiously thin.The score was average and the 'spooky' projector audio effect emanating from the attic now and then sounded more like Predator or a hungry rat. Juliet Rylance as Tracy, Ellison's wife, starts off with a British accent which morphs into a strange American-Irish inflection - a minor point, but off-putting just the same. Other familiar horror touch points bordered on tired cliche, perhaps for no other reason than they just weren't that well executed.The ending actually recovers things to a degree, but perhaps if certain aspects were revealed to the audience prior then there might have been more scope to deliver thrills and chills earlier, on a more consistent basis.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Watch something better if you REALLY want to enjoy a movie.,"I usually don't write reviews but stick to reading all of them before watching a movie. I did the same for Sinister, and a 7.3 for me is good stuff. So I went to watch it yesterday and I realized it was my biggest mistake. I am usually not scared of horror movies but enjoy this stuff. There was not one scene that actually made me uncomfortable. Yes, if you would consider random outbursts of screen popping with a monster and heavy sounds as scary, you are a baby. The story wasn't special and Ethan Hawke's performance was amateur to say the least. The entire audience was laughing at his exaggerated scared face. Who would use a base ball bat to fight a paranormal being? I tried hard to sit through it, hoping something nice would pop up, but it was all in vain. I actually thought this would be better than Paranormal Activity 4 who's got just 4.4 and is not even released yet. But I'll honestly say I enjoyed the Paranormal series much more. At least they had instances that made me excited. Sinister is a waste of time and money and more of a comedy than a HORROR. It was easily the worst movie decision of my life.

One of the best modern horror films I've seen. But obviously cannot compete with the old-school.,"I usually hate horror films. Not because they are horror films, but because they are usually clichéd, predictable and just plain bad. There hasn't been a decent horror film since Saw and before that, not since the late 80's. I wanted to give this one a go though because Ethan Hawke was in it and also because the plot was actually somewhat good and put a twist on the whole found footage thing. To my surprise the film was better than I thought it would be. It was good and enjoyable. Not an engrossing film and the characters are somewhat two-dimensional, although they do try to make them more.The film was a bit predictable at times and had a few stupid horror moments, but I liked it. I like the fact that they created Ethan Hawke's character as a writer looking for his next big hit and that's why he stays on. Because to be honest, the second I saw the villain I'd be gone. But this character is determined to seek the answer to the question: who killed the family? There are a few jumpy bits, but it's because of the sound editing more than anything else. It is one of the best modern horrors I've seen. But obviously cannot compete with the old-school.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Tiw Sinister,"Today i watched sinister and unfortunately every time I've seen this movie its gotten worseLike, this film is fine to me, I think it has good acting, alright cinematography, and I enjoy the oldschool footage.Unfortunately this film is incredibly cliche, incredibly predictable, and very heavily relies on jumpscares. Like this film has SO many jumpscares. The story is something that has been shown a million times in several different movies. The mystery of the film is predictable from like the 20 minute mark and there are many cliched story plotpoints.The cold open looks awesome and is incredibly uncomfortable for me to watch, but unfortunately it really does lessen the impact of certain parts of the film. Like I wish the cold open could have been different or maybe even cut out... Really does effect the pacing of the filmAlso the villain is much less scarier when parts of the film are revealed to you. It feels like this movie could have maybe been about 15 minutes shorter and like i mentioned before it probably could have been paced a bit better. It feels front loaded but there are payoffs near the end of the film, but there's a full sequence in the middle with Ethan Hawke that like i guess looks kinda neat but doesn't have any purpose other than being spooky for the audience really? I feel the movie ridiculously drags in certain parts very terribly.Even with all of this stuff I've said, I still really do enjoy and love this movie despite its flaws. There are positive elements to the film that I do really appreciate. Like i previously mentioned, I really love the super 8 footage, they're terrifying on the first viewing imagining myself in that situation. The acting is very good from most of the cast and the actors that I didnt think were great werent in the film enough to be super annoying. I thought the soundtrack by boards of canada was very effective. I didnt like the original soundtrack for the film that was not great, but it was i guess serviceable.Overall this is a film that is not that great but I still love it despite the fact that its incredibly cliche and isnt the best technically. I would still recommend this and I do still think this film is good.Low 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Not What I was Expecting...,"...but it was by no means bad. I have seen well over two hundred horror movies, so I have seen it all from the mild to grotesque. Perhaps I am a bit desensitized, but I was not the only person in the audience who walked away completely unshaken. This movie is not scary. It is, however, a very well done thriller. Do not go in expecting a horror movie, because you will be disappointed. However, be prepared to witness a well constructed story with some imagery that will stick with you for a while.The main problem I had with this movie was that the villain - a demon named Bagul - was scary to look at but did little to nothing as far as violent action was concerned. He orchestrated everything, but I found him to be much less scary of a character because you didn't even really need to see him and the movie would have reached the same means to an end as it did. It is one thing to make a character look terrifying, but unless he or she follows through with actions that back up their appearance I feel like a lot is lost.That being said, every one of the recorded murders were difficult to watch. Although a lot was implied (only showing blood in one case) there was enough to go on that you knew the families met a horrible demise. I do not want to give anything away, but the look of terror in one of the victim's faces on the lawn is not one I will soon forget. The visuals were very effective and the characters were all there, but for some reason I felt like it never ""clicked.""I would highly recommend seeing it if you want to get in the Halloween spirit and feel uncomfortable for an evening, but if you want to watch a truly shocking movie I have a whole list of ones available on Netflix instant streaming that are a lot scarier.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
atmospheric but lacking substance,"Aesthetically, I think this is a really good horror movie. In character & plot however, there's not much there. You never really know anything about the characters, they seem more like placeholders in a partially-finished script.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not overrated, but close...","I left the theater with mixed feelings. Reviews on IMDb blew my mind with comparisons (Insidious, one of my all time favourites) so I guess I gave Sinister a chance because of some good reviews. I'm not at all disappointed, but may be not the huge horror movie I expected to see.The thing with Sinister is that you have this wonderful music composed by Christopher Young. Chilly as hell. The best soundtrack for a horror movie in a while. Music is a factor of fear by itself in Sinister. I liked the plot though it may be redundant and have not so many surprises. I liked Ethan Hawke at the final part of the movie. He portraits so good his character. In fact, it has some connections with The Shining in order to character development. One man who begins to freak out and loses his temper and calm with things occurring. His annoying wife, though, spoiled the entire movie. She's not the bond Ethan needs to continue with his obsession to find the killer of those families.Nevertheless, Sinister has some good scare jumps, but lacks in gore. This was a movie which could've improved the path of Insidious. Of course, demons, haunted houses, but no James Wan. Neither gory scenes. But yes, good scares guaranteed.It is pretty solid plot, I find no holes in it, but from time to time, situations on the movie become a little overexposed and boring.We have a villain, people! Bagghul is badass, I liked the inventive on this issue: it becomes harder these days as horror movies go by, to create a menacing villain. This is the case, and that's a good point to mention.But I'm not sure this is THE horror movie of the decade. It's a good one, better than many, but still a little clichéed and lacks in development of the villain and his awful methods as well as my hunger for gore and spectacularity was not fulfilled.But it's still worth the watch. It is all-the-way tense (at least in Ethan's crime investigations and the eventual finding of Bagghul), but there were some scenes that conspired against perpetuating the tense feeling. Kind of relief scenes which could have been erased. Also, there is a lot of redundancy on common images and themes. C'mon, Bagghul! You could have killed some more families! And for those who ask; nothing to do with Saw.I liked Sinister, don't say I didn't. It deserves a 7 out of 10. Excellent soundtrack, good plot, better acting, tense moments, a little naive snuff and scary jumps spreaded once in a while. It is a 7.Cheers from Argentina!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Extremely scary and creepy piece of supernatural horror film,"Finally a horror film that packs some quality and delivers on the hype.Sinister is a very unsettling, disturbing and scary film.This film successfully mixes the POV ""Found Footage"" style horror with the traditional narrative. Fans of the found footage genre will enjoy this but more importantly those who aren't fans of the genre might find this style works better for them as it blends both styles effectively.From the very opening shot you know this film is going to be a ride. I found certain sequences in the movie extremely disturbing (in a good way) and some images were burned onto my subconscious memory long after the film had finished. This is a true horror film in the sense that there are a few jump scares but it does not rely on them which is refreshing and it is not a total gore-fest. It balances the two very well and delivers a very tense atmosphere with some harrowing images.Ethan Hawke is great and carries the film confidently as he delivers a very convincing performance. I happily watched him for the entire duration of the film and didn't find myself taken out of the film due to bad acting, which is rare in a horror film.I regard myself as a very hardened horror viewer and I am not easily scared... When I got home after the cinema, I was spooked. I found myself closing my blinds and turning on all the lights.Not a particularly pleasant viewing, Sinister accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do.Good, solid horror film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Film Overview,"I started to watch this with a sense of trepidation in that ""you have seen one you have seen them all"" kind of mood. However this film throws up up its own surprises , none of which I shall give away.This film does not go for unnecessary gore , blood and violence but uses good,old fashioned well built up tension with a music score that leads you into the story, you know something is going to happen, you even think you can guess what is going to happen but you will invariably be wrong.Ethan Hawkes plays his character brilliantly going through all the emotions of a writer, father and husband, wrestling with his emotions as he tries to combine all three parts of his life.Moving into the new house our story opens and really gets going on the discovery of home films which assist Hawke in his book writing. As he investigates further and starts to ask more and more questions strange things begin to occur. You may jump a little but there is nothing over excessive in the violence stakes with many scenes cutting away at the point where the most disturbance could be caused.The speed of the destroy accelerates but not to quickly allowing the story to develop at its good pace making sure you don't miss anything as our other characters are introduced. The ending is not predictable (in my humble opinion) and maintains the integrity of the who,e film without going into the outrageous as many of these films ca do.Sit back and enjoy like I did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Finally, the correct use of found footage. Truly great movie.","""Sinister,"" is a great old school, supernatural horror movie, and is a great example of how, if you are going to do it, to correctly make a movie involving the overused fad of ""Found Footage."" It's the story of a true crime writer,Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) that moves his family into a house formerly owned by a murdered family whose daughter is still missing. Investigating the murders for his new book he starts finding reels of 8mm footage, not only of the murdered family, but other murders as well, and a sort of boogeyman figure. Some sort of sinister plot is unfolding around him, and his sanity, and sense of dread may soon cause his family's demise as well.The Good: This is a great horror movie. It's a sort of murder mystery/ supernatural thriller/ just plain creepy film that is reminiscent of the horror movies of the past that still creep us out today. In many ways it is much in the style of the old classic, ""The Shining,"" mixed with the more new school of films such as ""The Ring."" There is no corny element to it which too many movies put in today, and it makes it a delight, at least for me, to watch.Ethan Hawke was excellent as the crime writer and father who is seeking that next big book, yet feeling himself slip away from his idealistic views of why he chose that genre in the first place are fading. That is saying a lot coming from me because I am not a big Ethan Hawke fan outside of ""Training Day."" He plays the part well, and really does a great job as the story takes hold and he begins to descend into a terrified, drinking man both continuing to investigate, and feeling a sense of dread at what he might find.The found footage in this one was great. Yes, I said it, great! Found footage is the new fad and I hate it! But this time it was perfect. The 8mm film, much of it from the 70's and early 80's had a sort of Manson-esque look that made for quite the stirring factor. I loved it.The Bad: I really don't have a lot of bad comments to make about this movie. I could probably say that Juliet Rylance, who plays the wife and mother, Tracy, wasn't great or memorable, but then again this was more of a closed off to one man type of story. So, it didn't hurt it any. Other than that Fred Thompson probably should have had a more prominent role in the story as the town police chief.I give this one a 10. Some may disagree, but for someone that grew up with movies like ,""The Shining,"" ""Carrie,"" and ""The Exorist,"" I appreciated the overall feel of this one and all the elements were there. It was creepy and chilling. The found footage aspect was done in a way that added to the story and the feel of them worked. Great movie for any horror fan that is getting tired of the same cliché recent movies and longs for a real good creepy movie.

It was just okay.,"Just finished Sinister a few minutes ago. It was decent as a horror film, but didn't really bring anything terribly new to the table. It has some jump scares, some earned and some cheap. It only sort of stuck the landing at the end. I ended up liking watching Ethan Hawke's performance the best out of all aspects of the movie, and the extended, one-take conversations and argument scenes with his wife were quite good. However, this felt like it would have been much better as a 30 short in a horror anthology rather than a full feature. There just wasn't enough story to cover the time they had, and therefore it felt slow (and not in a ""slow burn"" type of way but more of a ""spinning their wheels"" sort of way to fill time).

Desperate for another hit book and buried under pressure from his unknowing and un-patient wife, Ellison works diligently to solve the case of the missing little girl for his new book. After coming across a box of videos in the attic of the family that was murdered he realizes he may be opening a door to something he won't be able to walk away from.Ethan Hawke delivers a performance we aren't used to in horror films. He plays a character not sure of his own true motives. He wonders whether he is putting his family through this to save a missing child or to prove he can write a great book after his last several have failed. He closes himself off from his family out of obsession with the book yet never goes off the deep end. He is reserved and does a great job showing his inner turmoil using subtle facial expressions and line delivery rather than going off the deep end and overacting. You can sense his fear without being told about it. It's a refreshing performance for a genre not known for its acting. Especially since for the majority of the film he's the only one on screen.Most of the horror in Sinister comes from the found footage video reels we view alongside Ellison. They document several terrible incidents; one in particular involving a lawn mower that is extremely unsettling. A lot of the other scenes meant to frighten though are much less original and less disturbing. Even with the slow burning suspense of the film; the ending scene comes fast and is slightly disappointing. It always felt as though the scares could have been taken a step further.Sinister has a nice platform to tell a horror story and a capable actor in a role that fits him perfectly. At times the slow pace is perfectly suspenseful, leading us to believe we are in for an emotionally scarring climax (in a good way). At other times it had me rolling my eyes as plot lines were re-enforced over and over again (We get it, he needs a new bestseller!) and left me wondering if the film had enough time left after an hour and fifteen minutes passed to truly frighten. The footage Ellison finds delivers a lot of extremely eerie sequences but when the horror begins to occur in real time Sinister loses its originality and feels like a different film entirely.The whole story and feel of the film though is pleasantly creepy and it's ultimately a well-made horror film that unfortunately falls short of being as memorable or frightening as I'd hoped. It may not have been as scary as I would have liked, but it is a good film that happens to be horror. That's rare enough to appreciate a little. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Bughuul the Bastard!,"After moving himself and his family into a new house that was the scene of a horrendous crime, true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) finds a box of 8mm ""snuff"" films that suggest the murder he is currently researching is the work of a serial killer whose career dates some way back still further...It is becoming the un-reviewable genre, horror that is, there are just too many splinters of horror to choose from and so many people to cater for. There are many who stand up and proudly proclaim that they will watch any horror film and view it on its own terms, yet in this new millennium age that doesn't appear to be the case. I know I'm at fault, I hate torture porn and excessive grue type films, they just bore me, so can I review Hostel 9, Saw 27 and Wrong Turn 12 fairly? No, I don't think I can. I mean the human body can only be sliced up in so many different ways right? Right? Vice Versa, can someone who loves Argento, Roth and the like, review fairly a boo-jump ghost story that caters for those who want to wet themselves when something jumps out of a cupboard? I really don't think so, but I digress...Sinister is a wonderfully creepy movie that deals firmly in the realm of demons who come into the real world to cause unmitigating terror and heartbreak. It has no ""axe"" to grind with the blood thirsty who want to see arteries sliced and diced, it just wants to put a protagonist front and centre as he gets in way above his head, have his family come under serious threat; especially the child (oh my, the children...), and throw in the odd ""boo-jump"" moment to keep the pant wetters happy. The video footage used to show us the previous crimes unnerves greatly and there's a strong mystery element to keep the intrigue level high, whilst the ending doesn't cop out in the slightest. Hawke is excellent, perfectly portraying a man horrified yet submerged by the need to unravel the story, but his turn is sadly balanced by Juliet Rylance as the wife who seems unable to generate believable emotion.This film really isn't for any horror fan who isn't into the ""demon in the real world"" type horror; like Insidious for example. While those who like this splinter of horror and still decry it brings nothing new to the table, I'll ask again, well what would you like to see brought to the table then? I love this sub-genre of horror, and I feel Sinister is one of the best films of its type in recent years. Its reputation amongst like minded adults is well founded...just don't watch the trailer first, mind! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good Modern Horror,"It has been quite since i saw a movie that really scared me or creeped me out but this movie did just that. If anything it was definitely creepy. The film language used some nice deep focus shots that helped build up and sustain the tension. The acting was good and Mr. Hawke was superb. One of the main building blocks of this film was the found-footage styled tapes. These creeped me out more than I thought they would. Definitely worth watching at night with some friends or if you don't want to sleep for the next few days, like me, then watch with headphones at night.

Really disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this movie, I went to every first showing on Friday, Too my local cinema, even took the day of work, this was very first movie I have saw in Cinema this year.Another horror movie shows too much in trailer, the most of scare scene were already seen in the trailer, it kinda takes the scare away from the movie, as we already seen it,There twos other scenes that thankfully were not in the trailer, one of them did make me Jump and there one scenes I found some what creepy.Normal I don't silly stuff, this really annoyed me in some parts, Main lead hears a loud noise but no ones else seem to hear it, even the next night, when he falls, makes noise and starts screaming really loud, No one else seem to here or come by after he fall thought the floor!The other thing that really annoyed me was the really loud shouting scenes, it was over the top and was not needed at all, my head start hurt!This movie as Nothing we not really see before in pass horror movies, For me this me kinda drag on a little, when we finally know the story.Then they rush the the ending as it's gets way too predicable, there one scenes that really reminded me of Insidious as well.talking about Insidious, I was not big fan of it but I Would watch that over this any day.5 out of 10",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"If you think it's not scary, you were talking/laughing to make yourself feel better.","If you didn't get scared, you are either one of these three things...1. An advocate for gallows humor, also known as trying to make things funny so that you don't end up getting scared. If you do this, it is also likely you have convinced yourself you are some horror guru, listen to the plot, believe the plot, the whole point is that it's supposed to be real, and it ISN'T hard to get sucked in.2. Tried to find plot holes, which there aren't any. (If you found some then you didn't bother trying to get entertained and spent the whole movie trying to find one)3. Went with a bunch of friends and talked after every scary scene to make it OK.This movie is SCARY. Plain and simple. The progression of the plot is brilliant.

"Scary, well written, and unappreciated.","The movie had scares; it had things that made you want to sleep with a night light. I am no ""fearless"" person but I am a horror fan, when I was watching this my little sister did not scream as much as I did, it could be the fact she probably didn't comprehend some of what was going on but the point is this movie frightened me from beginning to end. It kept you on the edge of your couch wondering what's going to happen next. Is the main character going to be okay? The story progressed well in my opinion and having the main character be a writer who studies murders just really kept it going good. Some people can't appreciate a good horror movie just because they aren't scared of most things anymore, but if you scare easy then this is something to get your heart pumping. The ending went well too, I personally don't like endings like it did, but it had to happen and they did it well.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The ending almost ruined it for me,"¨Get the kids. Pack the car. We have to leave here now.¨It's a known fact that before watching a horror movie you have to leave your brain out of the room. I usually hate horror movies because I find them predictable and dumb. Most of the leading characters end up making really bad decisions. These rules aren't the exception with Sinister. The film has several plot holes (like how the police officers can't make the connections between the murders in the first place) and it also has the leading character making one terrible decision after another. Despite all that, and a terrible ending, I still found some sort of enjoyment in this film. It did manage to scare me in a couple of scenes and for that I must give credit to a horror movie. It's really hard to find a scary movie nowadays, and Sinister did manage to make me jump on a few occasions. By no means am I saying that this is a great film, but I will admit that it was enjoyable for at least more than half of the film. Sinister was directed by Scott Derrickson who also directed The Exorcism of Emily Rose. This film also deals with supernatural powers, but is much more violent and spooky. There are several scenes of homemade video murders that will give you some goose bumps. The screenplay was written by Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill. Like in most films of this genre the easy part is to find some spooky scenes, the difficult part is to find a decent ending to put everything together. Sinister fails to find a satisfying ending, had it found one it could have been one of the best horror films in a long time. I can't recommend Sinister unless you are a huge fan of the genre; otherwise it is yet another forgettable picture.The movie opens with what looks to be a homemade video of a family being hung over a tree in their backyard. Then we are introduced to the main character: Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) who is moving in to the house where the horrific murders took place. Oswalt is a true-crime novelist who became famous for his first book on a crime he investigated in Kentucky. His next books didn't have the same success so he and his family are going through some rough times economically. The reason Ellison wants to move to this house is because he thinks he can write another powerful novel on the horrific murders that took place in the house. Moving to that same house would be a great start for his investigation. His wife, Tracy (Juliet Ryliance) and their two children Ashley (Clare Foley) and Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario) do not know about the terrible murders that took place in that same house, and Ellison tries to keep it that way. Once they arrive at the house, Ellison finds a box containing a projector and several super 8 films of footage from horrific murders (including the murder in his own house which we saw at the beginning of the movie). This all seems as great material for his next book as he begins to investigate each one of these murders and finds some connections between them, but the more he digs deeper into the case the more strange things begin to get around the house. The question he has to ask himself is whether he and his family can remain safe there.The film has some interesting premises but it does get very predictable half way through the movie. Sometimes I just felt like hitting Ellison for all the terrible decision he was making (so typical in a horror film. Ethan Hawke gives a pretty solid lead performance, despite all the mistakes he makes you still end up caring for him. He is really the only character that is developed in the story. The rest of the cast you could really care less for, especially the wife who I didn't like one bit. I thought Ryliance's performance wasn't really up to par with Hawke's. The chemistry between them was nonexistent. The kid actors were good, but they really weren't developed at all. The entire film was focused around Hawke and his investigation of the murders. There were a few other supporting characters, but none really worth a mention. Sinister has a terrible ending and that really cost the film in my opinion because it did have some potential. It isn't a great horror film, but it probably is the best one of the year.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Refreshing Take on an Otherwise Worn Out Plot,"I'm a big time horror film fanatic and so of course I've seen plenty. Unfortnately though, there isn't much I haven't seen in terms of plot and scare tactics. I'm still a fan of the franchise but there isn't much if anything that sends a shiver up my spine these days. I had seen the previews for Sinister about a month in advance before Halloween. It looked promising but then again they always do. Late in October I decided to view the film with a group of friends, my hopes not so high but it was something to keep me from ending the evening early. Much to my surprise I was highly impressed with what I saw. The opening scene was so eerie and captured my complete attention from the start. The plot was not completely original but it was tweaked in such a way that it was still intriguing and refreshing to someone like me who's seen it all before. I was genuinely frightened by this film and I've been recommending it ever since.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Sinister is Pure Fear.,"How many Horror movies tried over and over, remake after remake to put fear into viewers heart and to make them walk out of the movie completely satisfied and scared?!.. not many that I can tell you, Sinister is one of those movieIt understands what is real fear, and not just a ridiculous Halloween mask.. every detail every shot isn't just another ""jumpy moment"", just looking at it you get scared instantly ! movies like that should be put on the top of the lists as they are ""REAL"" horror movies, kind of like insidious, now that was a great movie and sinister has the same ""style"".and the storyline is just incredible nothing better than the combination of horror and mystery in one great film, although i would recommend to not watch the trailer because it tells you a lot! and you just have to see it to know the feeling and if you're a real horror fan you'll add this to you favorite movie's list, trust me. Sinister is real pure fear.My rating is 10/10, it truly deserves a rating like that and I was 100% satisfied, and would LOVE to see more movies like that in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Did not see this one coming...,"See this in the movie theater. That's the first statement I'd like to make in this review. The film is very dark, very suspenseful, and frightens you when it intends to. Most horror films nowadays sadly make the audience laugh in mockery when it tries to spook them (Paranormal Activity Sequels). Yet, this film made the audience jump and scream at its demand.I will not spoil the movie for you, but it's story is very different, yet interesting for a horror film. I thoroughly enjoyed the story as it progressed and built up to the climax. The one flaw I found in the film was that I figured out the key revelation before it was given at the end of the film. Again, I won't tell you what the surprise was, but I think most audience members figured it out since we were all sucked into the film when it began.So, in conclusion: 1. See this in theaters during the Halloween season, because packed audience has the potential to make it more frightening. I had the pleasure of watching this movie with a good crowd (the kind that didn't talk or make jokes during suspenseful moments)2. Scares you with story-telling and acting, as opposed to seeing gore and blood.3. Good luck going into your attic after watching ""Sinister"".

Who Said That There Are No Good Horror Film Directors Out There?,"Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant horror film, with an ending that will send shivers down your spine. Even a hardened horror film fan like myself, I am having second thoughts about seeing this movie again.Why? Because its so god-damn scary. I feel that if I watch it again, I will be like doing something forbidden: like Devil-worshiping. If you have seen that James Wan film Dead Silence, you know what happens at the very end of the film. This film is even scarier than Dead Silence, The Grudge and The Ring Combined.I might be even bold to say that this film is even better than The Exorcist. Because in The Exorcist, the evil is manifest and seen by all. Here the evil is so hidden, you have to be clever even to find it at all.Brief plot of film: The film opens with Super 8 footage depicting a family of four standing beneath a tree with hoods over their heads and nooses around their necks. An unseen figure saws through a limb acting as a counterweight, causing them all to be strangled. Months later, washed-up true crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) moves into the murdered family's home with his wife, Tracy (Juliet Rylance), and their two children Ashley (Clare Foley) and Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario). Ellison intends to use the murders as the basis for his new book, and hopes that his research will turn up the fate of the family's fifth member, a little girl named Stephanie who disappeared following the murders.Verdict: Engrossing horror film which will keep you glued to your seat. You may also want to see it again, so it would be a good idea to buy the DVD/BLU-RAY. Seasoned director Scott Derrickson who also directed The Exorcism Of Emily Rose, The Day the Earth Stood Still and Hellraiser: Inferno, does the best direction of his career.Veteran music director Christopher Young needs no introduction. With hits in his bag like Hellraiser, Hellbound: Hellraiser 2, A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge, The Fly II, Hider In The House, The Dark Half, Copycat and Virtuosity, you expect class background music.The only notable star in the film Ethan Hawke, does a professional job and does not overact.Watch the film to find out what happens next!Other horror films to watch: Apartment 143, Red Lights, Cabin In The Woods, Chained, Possession, The Factory(John Cusack).",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
SiNiStEr viciously rapes and kills all other main stream Hollywood horror movies with unrelenting brutality,"September, 2005. As I sat in the packed auditorium watching The Exorcism of Emily Rose, I immediately knew within the first 20 minutes into the film that the scenes and images I've seen so far is the work of a horror director of a like mind. That is, a mind of horror, unrelenting viciousness, a silent and tranquil bloodbath of an imagination. It takes one to know one, and I knew instantly we were of like minds, and I was going to watch very closely all of his future works.Fast forward seven years, catching the 10 p.m. show of SiNiStEr on Oct. 12, 2012 Thursday night, I eagerly anticipate this work. During the film, I saw probably the most chilling and ingenious five second scene in my entire movie watching experience thus far(I'll give you a clue so you know what I'm talking about after you watch it: it had something to do with a laptop). And I see 3 other very excellent scenes. All in all, it shot straight to my all time top 10 list(I've seen at least 3000 movies), and the best, I repeat best horror film I've ever seen. It was almost watching my own work, because it is very similar to a film I would've made if I had the opportunity.While there's some room for improvement, it viciously rapes and kills all other main stream Hollywood horror movies with unrelenting brutality and an odd touch of subtle tranquility.On a side note, I knew I kind of ruined the full potential of my movie experience by watching the trailer because they included that best 5 second scene. I hate the trailer editor so much, why did you have to put the best scene in the whole movie into the trailer? You can be rest assured, I will not watch the next Scott Derrickson's movie trailer. So if you haven't seen the trailer, please don't, and go watch the movie on the big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Testifies that graphic violence is unnecessary to make a frightening ghost story.,"When it comes to the underside of modern cinema, the horror genre frequently falls victim, plagued by uninspired remakes and tiresome clichés. For some time it's been apparent that fresh original ideas are not easy to come by and I'm among the many that misses being scared. I attended a theatrical showing of Sinister with soaring expectations, prepared to be frightened once again, and left almost two hours later more satisfied than I've been in a long time. This supernatural movie is easily the most impressive of it's kind in recent years. Exorcism of Emily Rose director Scott Derrickson has demonstrated an effective ability to convey horror and understands how powerful atmosphere and suspense can be. Let's hope that he'll continue to give us more.True crime novelist Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) sees great potential for his accomplishment of a lifetime in an unsolved murder that has taken place in the house that he and his family have moved into. His only lead, a mysterious box of Super 8 footage of the murder that has taken place in his new home as well as several other cases of unsolved family murders abroad, found in the attic. Oswalt's findings deduce two aspects that make a connection with each murder. A disappearance of one child in each family and a demonic apparition that appears somewhere in each film. The malevolent phenomenon of the movie is the Pagan deity Buhguul, who subsists on the souls of vulnerable children and resides in a netherworld to which images serve as a gateway for him. Even though Buhguul is silent and makes brief appearances, his presence is felt and feared throughout the movie and he is sure to find his way into your nightmares for a long while to come. The possibility of solving the mystery is opened thanks to the advantage of modernized technology. As the investigation unfolds, eerily evocative happenings begin happening to Oswalt's family. Against forces beyond his comprehension, Oswalt becomes torn between his goal of uncovering the truth and the well being of his loved ones.Ethan Hawke is very believable in portraying his role. You feel his determination to uncover the truth and how much his job means to him. As he becomes more detached from his family so do we as an audience. He emphasizes a potential that I hope won't remain obscured. Palpable tension builds as the climax draws ever closer and the intensity is amplified by haunting visuals and Christopher Young's spine-chilling soundtrack. The blend of Super 8 footage with traditional cinematography gives Sinister a gritty down-to-earth feel, taking the viewers along for the experience.I've long grown accustomed to foreseeing and identifying film clichés and predictable outcomes, especially in the horror genre, but to my great surprise I found myself frightened on both a conscious and subconscious level. Graphic violence and explicit bloodshed are not needed to make a ghost story scary and Sinister deserves to be admired in this respect. What greater horror can exist than the evil that defies our comprehension? To all my fellow avid fans of the horror genre that have thought about giving Sinister a watch, surrender to your temptation because a refreshing treat awaits you!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I Did Not Like This Movie!,"Since my childhood, I've been a fan of horror films. In recent years, the quality of horror films have dwindled and many films are recycled versions of older movies. How is a horror film measured, then?Well firstly, it has to be scary. A horror must disturb, frighten, shock, surprise and make you cover your eyes. About 1 out of every 10 horrors manages to truly achieve this. Secondly, it has to be entertaining. ""Sinister"", recycled and clichéd as it is, fortunately is most of the former. I can't recall a film that made me feel so much dread, I almost couldn't bring myself to watch with full intent. The latter... it was most definitely not. I did not enjoy watching this film, ONE BIT.So, when it comes to scoring ""Sinister"" I give praise to the director for terrifying the wits out of me, because that's what a horror is supposed to do! The imagery is very creepy from the start, and the diabolical character Baghuul is frighteningly twisted to say the least, and forgive me for adding - ""pretty f***ed up."" The director's last horror offering, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005)"" was almost equally disturbing in this sense. What Emily Rose had and ""Sinister"" didn't, though, was that enjoyment factor.... that 'kick' I get out of watching really good horror films. ""Sinister"" scary as it was, was too tedious. Aside from great acting by Ethan Hawke, I don't have any other praise for this movie.Cut-above-the-average horror, disturbing & hair-raising - but not enjoyable at all. I dare you to watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Highly overrated! Disappointing,"After watching the movie, I was so disappointed that I had to actually look up if I saw the same movie as everyone else did or not. I came across this movie while surfing for some good horror movies, and as a matter of fact, this one was rated the best by a couple of lists. The first half has some decently horrifying scenes, which end up pretty futile in their attempt to scare their audience. But like most of the horror movies, people tend to think that the movie is building up for the actual horror, which most probably will be shown in the second half. Now as the movie progresses, your disappointment gradually increases, as you begin to realize that it isn't scaring you even a little bit. The least they could have done was improvise on the clichéd scenes, like sudden popping up of ghostly faces and young demonic girls asking you to shush.Ethan hawk acted more like a teenager, rather than a guy who is in his mid 30s and a father of two teenagers. The direction wasn't good either, as Ethan Hawke was the only one who was feeling the presence of a supernatural thing in their house, and his wife was completely unaware of what all is going on.

"Utter, generic drivel","I cannot believe I wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this rubbish. I kept thinking that it must improve...right up until the credits. But no, it didn't! It just plodded its boring way though to an unfathomable ending, by which time I didn't give two hoots what happened to anybody in the film anyway. Nothing in it made sense, although to be fair within 30 minutes I'd pretty much given up trying to find a plot so maybe I missed something obvious through sheer boredom.The only reason I gave it two stars was because of the following:1-decent cinematography, without resorting to the hated wobby cam/wet poodle cam (that's a cam attached to a wet, shivering poodle which you then let lose on a film set)2-the acting was okay, with Hawke turning in an excellent performance as always. Just a shame the actors had total cack to work with in terms of story (lack thereof), tension (lack thereof), plot (was there one!) and just about everything else that goes to make a film entertaining.Oh, and as for being scary? I've worn trousers that were more frightening than this. Although, yet again to be fair, I have yet to see a movie that is actually scary, I think it's just about impossible to put something on film which is scary. You can make people laugh, cry, angry, feel good in a movie, but scary? Don't know why, but film makers just can't seem to crack that one. Or maybe it's just me.

Tension Roller Coaster- Solid Flick!,"Sinister is solid horror flick and one I would recommend going to see if you are fans of the genre. It has some very disturbing moments and the use of 8mm tape is genius and adds to the mood. The acting is strong and Ethan Hawke shines as a ""has-been"" author trying to strike it big again before his descent into terror.Another couple of solid notes worth mentioning are the soundtrack and cinematography of the film. Both are excellently done. Both will have you constantly tense and on edge while you constantly strain to see into room corners. Also, the short sequences shot on 8mm tape were excellently done and very disturbing.The storyline itself was weak. As it unfolds, it shouldn't take the viewer long to come to the only possible explanation as to what happened to the various different families as the simplest solution is probably the correct one. After this, all that's left is to wonder about whether the ending is going to be good or bad. The ending was disappointing and the explanation of what was happening from ""Deputy So-and-So"" was very contrived.One other note and I'm not really sure if this is a positive or a negative to the film to other people, but I found there was too much tension in the film! The constant darkness the movie seemed to be in started to become familiar to the point that scares weren't having the affect they probably should have. When you are constantly anticipating something, ""surprises"" lose their effect.At the end of the day, we go to a scary movie though for thrills and this does deliver in that respect.

The overall story is intriguing and scary in itself but believe me when I tell you there are many moments in this movie that will make you jump right out of your seat!

Definitely Sinister,"Sinister was an absolutely creepy horror mystery. It was an original story line following a writer and his family as he looks to write his next best true crime novel. Little did he know, he would become part of it. The dark narrative throughout was truly bone chilling and the story of this evil character controlling children is terrifying. I thought there was quality production throughout with some solid effects and good sound/music that added to the horror. Ethan Hawke was great as always and really made the story feel real. I'd definitely recommend this movie to any horror fan. It was one of the better ones.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Underwhelming,"Ethan Hawk plays writer Ellison Oswalt, who is determined to write another best seller. In order to do so he drags his family to a house where a grisly murder was committed for inspiration.And for me therein lays the problem with this film, Hawk's character is so grimly self obsessed and so deeply oblivious to the needs of his family that from the very first frame he is a kind of monster.When presented with a box of hard evidence of murders committed in his own house, he simply ignores any remaining instinct to hand it to the police and so the movie begins.It's basically a really long and drawn out reinterpretation of the teenagers going down to the woodshed when they hear something creepy is going on.The film plods along to its inevitable conclusion in a mildly entertaining but cliched way.Lots of half decent performances but ultimately an underwhelming film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Defining Horror - Hawke is Outstanding,"Eager for another bestseller a writer moves his family to another town where a series of murders has taken place to research his next book. However, he uncovers something more terrifying than he can put to paper, namely Mr. Boogieman.With a family hanging from a tree in the opening shot you know that Sinister is not pulling any punches. Rather than focusing on other worldly phantoms like Insidious (2010) (by the same producer Jason Blum), Sinister is more grounded even if still essentially a supernatural thriller. Thankfully, the now common place in horror found footage aspect is not focal in the traditional sense and is a product to move the intriguing premise forward.Director Scott Derrickson along with writers Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill deliver an absorbing slow build up with the main flawed, borderline alcoholic character Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke). Derrickson with director of photography Chris Norr give the film a innovative look, it's dark - very dark, with inky blacks, depth and shadows always on display. In all its boldly minimally lit going against convention creating some real ominous atmosphere. The production is tight and sharply edited by Frédéric Thoraval.With all you'd want there's haunting moving images and figures, creepy super 8 footage, spooky photos, a series of snuff films, local snooping cops and a concerned wife to name few. Although part murder mystery, Sinister is full of horror. Clever directing and lighting allows the viewer to make discoveries at the same time as Hawke and the sound design and visuals present several effective jump scares.Sinister's bonus is that it's well acted for the genre. Both Professor Jonas Vincent D'Onofrio and Fred Thompson as the Sheriff are natural and to Cargill and Derrickson's credit certainly character wise tries to go against predicable. The eerie Mr. Boogieman's appearance is limited and part of a larger mythology avoiding the need for a typical showdown which has been done to death in many horror films. There's not an annoying child actor in sight. I can't put my finger on it but Juliet Rylance while a good actress playing the down to earth wife and mother Tracy feels slightly out of place, possibly miscast. Notable is James Ransone as quirky concerned cop Deputy So-And-So. Hawke is on fine form - in what could have been stereotype writer going mad but plays it perfectly balanced and convincingly from the outset. He becomes desperate as the film becomes increasingly paranormal and the ancient demon reverence becomes prevalent. Debatably not since The Shining (1980) and Stir of Echoes (1999) has a male horror lead character been as interesting. You warm the guy despite his faults and you care about his fate.As it unfolds clichés rear their heads, a child's drawings on a wall, ghosts and so on but it all done in a naturalistic fashion with outstanding special visual effects. Again the special effects are not just for effects sake and fit within the scenes. There's an especially creepy scene when Oswalt investigates the noises in his house armed with a baseball bat but cannot see the sounds origins.It has a tight story and although the downbeat ending while well done leaves you a little empty. You feel there is going to be an inevitable sequel but you really wish they'd leave it neatly wrapped up. While Sinister's elements may not be entirely original it encompasses, combines and defines satisfyingly ideas that other horrors of it's kind have failed to do.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Dark Ambitions,"Sinister, directed by Scott Derrickson, is a dark and unnerving horror film that delves into the terrifying intersection of supernatural forces and psychological unraveling. The story follows true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke), who moves his family into a home where a brutal crime once occurred, hoping to find inspiration for his latest book. However, when Ellison discovers a box of disturbing home movies in the attic, he unknowingly awakens a malevolent force that threatens his family. With its chilling premise, strong lead performance, and unsettling atmosphere, Sinister offers a memorable horror experience, though its reliance on jump scares may divide some viewers.Ethan Hawke delivers a compelling performance as Ellison, embodying the desperation and obsession that drive him into increasingly dangerous territory. Hawke's portrayal brings nuance to the character, making Ellison both sympathetic and flawed as he struggles with the moral consequences of his ambition. The supporting cast, including Juliet Rylance as his wife Tracy, adds emotional depth to the family dynamic, grounding the supernatural elements in relatable, real-world conflict.Derrickson's direction expertly builds an atmosphere of dread and suspense, using dim lighting, lingering shots, and eerie sound design to heighten tension. The unsettling Super 8 footage sequences are among the film's most memorable scenes, each one escalating in terror as the true nature of the entity Bughuul is gradually revealed. The film's score, filled with dissonant, ominous tones, further intensifies the atmosphere, making every moment feel steeped in unease.While Sinister succeeds in delivering genuine scares and a deeply haunting atmosphere, its reliance on jump scares and shock value can occasionally feel repetitive. The focus on Ellison's obsession with uncovering the truth adds psychological depth, but at times it slows the pacing, detracting from the sustained suspense. Nonetheless, the film's exploration of themes such as ambition, guilt, and the cost of uncovering dark secrets makes it a more layered horror experience, leaving a lasting impression.In conclusion, Sinister is a creepy and unsettling film that uses atmosphere and strong performances to craft memorable scares. While it occasionally leans too heavily on jump scares, it remains a deeply frightening journey into the unknown, with enough emotional depth to make it a standout entry in supernatural horror.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Watch if you liked The Ring or Paranormal Activity,"I watched this by myself at 12am with most of the lights off. I can tell you that by the end of it I was pretty scared.The key is the atmosphere. Much like The Ring, the film builds atmosphere the whole way through so that by the end - you've bought into it. The music and sound is absolutely essential to this and it is done very well.The whole movie is creepy as hell and just thinking about it (I only watched it last night) still gives me shivers just thinking about it.If you like movies that have a demonic/satanic type evil in it - then Sinister is one of the better ones I've watched.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I'm not a horror fan,"I like good movies and sometimes those happen to be horror. But I'm not a fanboy for the genre or anything that restricts itself to the rules of the genre.This movie was really good. A few jump scares but not overdone like a lot of scary movies. The fear comes from the story and not the anticipation of the jump.I saw this preview years ago and thought that it had a good premise. But given that it's scary and produced by summit and Blum that didn't bode well. Ethan Hawk helped to legitimize it though. He's of course a really good actor but I feel like he can be talked into doing anything so he's done some crap. But I like that he's not above anything.I was glad that the movie delivered on the good idea and made a good movie out of it. I normally don't like it when a good idea turns out to be supernatural because it feels lazy but for this story it works.There's something scary about footage through a low quality camera. Again, done very well here.It was very engaging and I had my eyes glued to the screen. It actually prevented me from drinking my hot beverage because I didn't want to jump and spill it.The only annoying part was the wife.

His betrayal of the character helped you empathize and understand how this consumed him. Add the horror of realization as the story unfolded. For me imagining myself being put into that position. The end was a little predictable but I will definitely watch it again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Mediocre,Well just got back from seeing this and not sure what film the people giving it more than 6 were watching. One person says the twist at the end was genius? The ending was clichéd and extremely predictable for a film of this genre of late. Yes it had a few scary moments in it but they were all of the loud noise/something jumping out at you type. There is no real tension and you can guess the so called twist by about a quarter of the way in.The acting I felt was good enough even from the children.Personally I'd say wait for it to come out on DVD instead of wasting your money at the cinema.,5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
for fans of horror to enjoy,"Being scared is not fun for everybody. The horror movies genre has its addicts and fans, but also its haters or people who just avoid watching. I believe that with 'Sinister' directed by Scott Derrickson in 2012 we face one of those cases of a film that spectators who love or at least can live with the genre will like, while people who dislike horror movies would better be advised to skip it.The story in 'Sinister' fits into one of the most used patterns. A family which seems 'normative' by all criteria moves into a new house. It will soon be clear that the family is not that normative (the father makes a living from writing about sordid true crime stories) and that the house is also marked by having been a crime scene in the past. What is different in this film is that the fight between sanity and horror, between the tentative to explain things by logic and the powers of darkness is well described and the gradual fall in fear that happens in almost any good horror film is described in a credible manner. There is logic in what happens on screen, but this is the logic of horror films, and the viewers need to accept the rules in order to enjoy.What I liked. 'Sinister' follows the rules of the horror movies and the script graduates well the slow transition between 'normal' and 'horror'. Ethan Hawke gives a good performance of the writer trying to rationalize what happens to him and to his family and fights the occult with the wrong tools. The use of 16mm film to bring back the crimes of the past is a nice idea, and never has a box with film reels looked so frightening. Much of the film action takes place deep in the night, and the cinematography is adequate.What I liked less. I am always uneasy with kids in horror movies. I guess, however that this is part of the typical scripts in the genre or sub-genre. I also found the other characters and especially the wife (Juliet Rylance) too schematic.Fans of the genre will probably love this film. Most of the other, better chose something else.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This confined horror thriller is just plain creepy,"I heard of Sinister before I saw it. I had not heard much. I knew it was another horror movie starting Ethan Hawke. It got bigger on my radar when people started to put it in there top ten lists of horror movies of the 2010's. Then the word came out that the director Scott Derrickson was hired for Marvel's Doctor Strange. I was interested in his work so I did catch before this his big Hollywood horror film Deliver Us From Evil. And now after seeing Sinister I definitely think he's a nice choice for Doctor Strange.Sinister is a small confined film about a writer (Ethan Hawke) who moves his family to a house in order to write his new crime novel. He's not popular with the police and stuck in a bit of a rut. When strange occurrences start happening he realizes that he might be in over his head. This is one of those films that has to been seen totally cold. The film unfolds itself for the audience and the characters at the same time.The film is mostly contained to this house. All the characters and side characters converge here. Which makes the film feel a bit claustrophobic. The tension is built well, with a few jump scares that pay off. It's not a false scare of a red herring. When the story eventually plays out, everyone is hit with a proverbial brick to the face. The horror elements aren't shown in graphic details. This help the thrill of the film making you imagine the brutally. Even the film opening scene will get under my skin. There is a bit of a twist at the end. But it comes at a point where things just might develop. I was knocked me off my guard.Ethan Hawke is usually a hit or miss for me. But he does the down on his life writer well. The family around him aren't giving much to do. They help convey the story well. I was sucked into the story wanting to know what happened next. Derrickson knows his horror. There are inventive shots. He has a nice style on display. The movie moves at a pace that keeps the story from not getting too boring. When it starts to slow, there is a moment where something small will happen just to get the mind racing.I was on the edge of my seat from the beginning. I'm not easily scared. The jump scares do nothing for me. But not being able to see the brutal horror filled my mind with thoughts of unease. The film spreads dread from opening to end credits. That's something you don't get very often. It sat with me for hours after the film was over. It didn't help that I had watched The Conjuring hours beforehand. A small creepy film great for a late night viewings is what Sinister is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""Sinister"" is overselling it...","Amityville with an unlikable crime writer. It basically amounts to Ethan Hawke wandering around a dark house for nearly two hours, pretending to be scared, like an unwitting Pied Piper.It has all the elements for a spooky story, but either overuses images that could be creepy in isolation too many times to be consistently effective, or else doesn't want to put any proper meat on the bones of its central idea. Like a cheap fairground ride, there are a few jump scares, but any substance of true terror vanishes the second you emerge into daylight.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Psychologically terrifying.,"I am going to lose some man-points here but I found this absolutely terrifying.I am a big Ethan Hawk fan and he played the rather unlikeable main character very well.Ghost stories tend to have two flaws in my opinion.One: The characters have to put up with the ghosts and not run away. Here Hawke forces his family to endure the supernatural for reasons of money and ego. I bought this, I was yelling at the TV for his wife to leave him but every time she was ready to go he managed to stop being enough of a douche so she wouldn't.Two: Ghosts aren't scary in the flesh. OK they may kill you but then so can a peanut. Here the director teases you with the supernatural element bringing it out in short sharp horrifying doses.The film is a little slow (almost to Japanese levels), but this helps store larger amounts of suspense.Loved the cast, loved the story, watched most of it between my fingers, don't judge me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Spooky and Gripping,"I recently watched Sinister and thought it was just good. The story follows a true-crime writer named Ellison who moves into a house with a dark past to get inspiration for his next book. While there, he finds a box of old home movies that reveal disturbing footage of families being murdered. The plot is intriguing and has some genuinely scary moments that kept me on edge.Ethan Hawke did a great job as Ellison. He really made me believe his character's fear and obsession. The atmosphere of the film is also really well done. The house feels creepy, and the old film footage adds a lot to the eerie feeling.However, the movie had some flaws. The pacing felt slow at times, and there were parts where the story dragged a bit. Some of the jump scares were predictable, which took away from the overall scare factor. I also felt like some of the supporting characters weren't developed enough, making it hard to care about them.Overall, Sinister is a good horror movie with a solid story and a few great scares.

Would recommend viewing this though but didn't think there was enough historical occult background information to follow the plot.

But the layers started adding up. The suspense was suspended by Ethan's character studying the ""planted"" evidence he found in his newly-moved-in home.

Sinister,"A novelist turned true crime writer moves into a house where a mass murder was committed; one of the victims has not been found, a young girl, but she is presumed dead by the local sheriff, who doesn't like the newcomer on account of things he's said about police officers in general.Our scribe has of course told his wife about the connection, although she has no idea they are living in the actual house where the murders were committed, and when she finds out, she is understandably livid. Well dear he tells her, the victims weren't killed in the house but in the back garden, hung from that thar tree. Unsurprisingly, she's not buying it.On top of that, their son suffers from night terrors and his daughter wants to move back to their previous palatial home. Naturally this doesn't wash, and of course he wants to both solve the murders and find the missing girl alive. Then he makes a mysterious find, some old style film and a projector in the attic which the police and everyone else appear to have overlooked. When he views this film and with some help from a junior law officer who has a degree in criminology, he becomes convinced this is the work of a serial killer who has been at large since the 1960s. Or could this be some sort of cult? More to the point, how much of it is in his head?His helper with the badge points him to an academic who suggests there is indeed a demonic connection, an ancient deity called Bagul, the devourer of children. So is he looking for a serial killer, a demon, or maybe he should just pack up and run? After yet another scare he chooses the latter, but is flight the right thing? Somehow you get the impression this is all going to end very badly.This film has some good atmospheric moments; the implication is that the ghosts of the victims are not in his head, and some of the happenings defy rational explanation. Many films of this type are confusing with dream sequences, flashbacks and so forth. By and large, ""Sinister"" avoids these pitfalls, but don't watch it if you like happy endings.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Mark my words- Watch Sinister to get horrified,"Horror movies should have a nice reputation with spine- chilling-with-a- twist ending something like Sixth Sense, Dead Silence, The Grudge and to some extent SAW franchises( might not come into horror genre) . As I was craving for a good horror movie, I noted Sinister directed by Scott Derrickson in 2012 and curiosity ran through me to watch this one and I was glad to get scared with the spooky thriller.A true crime writer shifts to a new place to get idea for writing a book. He discovers a 8 MM camera which plays the old record of killings occurred in that place which eventually puts his family in danger.Now this is some spooky thriller that has some hair-raising and heart- pulping moments. Scott Derrickson who has given some of good horror drama like The Exorcism Of Emily Rose and Deliver Us From Evil succeeds with this one as well. Nice background score coupled with solid story and attention grabbing screenplay, Sinister is one of best horror movies I have seen recently. The flip side is that screenplay looses the steam in the 2nd half and less spooky moments should have been more. Performances by the star cast is good and convincing.

Stupid,"I am so sick of scary kids in movies. They are just not scary f one came at me I'd kick them in the throat. Despite a truckload of positive buzz I never jumped on the Sinister train completely the trailers and TV spots just didn't look very good. So I went into this with not low but mid level expectations and came out a little disappointed to be honest. Not to say there weren't things I liked about this film. There were a few decent scares and the home movies usually feeling forced come across quite genuine, amateur and disturbing. That aside honestly there's just not very much to recommend here. There is a good idea here and Bagul could have been a frightening character but that last twist just throws off the movie completely in my opinion and the worst thing is that you see it coming and your still hoping for something more. And thats basically the film a waiting game that rarely pays off and when it does it's decent enough if a little generic. The film stars Ethan Hawke slumming it as an author of true crime novels who moves into the house of a murdered family he's basing his next book off of. He discovers some old home movies in the attic featuring some of the old murders and creepy things start to happen. As the movie plods along unenthusiastically we learn about a Deity named Bagul who ""eats"" small children. I don't wanna spoil anything for those of you who are going to see it. You should relish every small twist because there's not many and don't look at any of the trailers, TV spots or poster because they show everything. When it finally culminates it's not very exciting and moves into even more forced generic territory coming off like a mediocre rip off of the Amityville Horror remake without Ryan Reynolds abs sadly. All in all it's a mixed bag and although it has some decent qualities it's nothing special. And it's all really just kind of stupid.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Sure, it's not the most incredible plot ever written, but it's engaging enough. For those of you who are wondering why I gave this movie a 9, allow me to explain. I typically rate movies according to their genres, and intended reactions. In this case, the purpose of a horror film is to scare the crap out of people.

"Scary and creepy, 'Sinister' is a fine horror, but nothing too terrifying.","Certainly creepy on a regular basis, 'Sinister' is able to sustain a chilling atmospheric feel throughout however you won't be requiring a new pair of pants.Ethan Hawke is outstanding and believable as a man who's insanity is tested to the limit. Ellison Oswalt is a wannabe author who moves he and his family into a new house in search of an interesting non-fiction tale to tell. Keeping the house's gruesome past to himself, Ellison attempts to figure out answers to the investigation, only to come across forces even he thought unimaginable.Yes, the narrative and the scenes are clichéd. However, its the clichés which are so scary. 'Sinister' is certainly scary occasionally and without crying out with fear or whimpering in the corner, it certainly leaves its mark - if you're a timid person in search of scares, 'Sinister' should tick the boxes. Perhaps if you are more relaxed with the horror genre, you may be a little disappointed.The actual story is rather intriguing and the whole investigation had me hooked. The story may not be pact full of terrifying moments, but their is certainly a shivery ambiance throughout - this certainly compelled me into the film further.Critics have described 'Sinister' as 'the scariest movie in decades' and others say that Scott Derrickson the films's writer and director did 'absolutely nothing right'. Certainly the latter is not true and extremely harsh however the former is perhaps a little to generous.

Sinister - When Writing a Book Takes You Straight to Hell,"Ethan Hawke plays a washed-up writer who moves into a haunted house and thinks watching creepy home videos in the attic is a good idea. Well done, champ, you've just unlocked the expert level of psychological horror. Those Super 8 reels? They're not Charlie Chaplin comedies-they're homemade snuff films soaked in a chilling atmosphere. This isn't a house; it's a museum of discomfort.The demon Bughuul is basically the horror movie version of the dreaded mother-in-law: he doesn't say a word, just stares at you, and you're already drenched in cold sweat. There's no need for excessive gore here-the sound design and visual suggestions are enough to crush your nerves. Every creak of the floorboards, every whir of the film reel is an auditory slap telling you, ""You're sleeping with the lights on tonight.""See this guy? He thinks moving into the scene of a murder might be dangerous. No kidding, Sherlock! But the issue isn't that he's dumb-it's that he's a writer.

And Ethan Hawke, with his wrinkled pajamas and perpetual look of a man on the verge of a breakdown, reminds you of this every two minutes.The special touch of Sinister? Creepy kids. As if Bughuul lurking in the background wasn't bad enough, wait until you see those cursed children lurking in the hallways. This is top-tier horror where even a game of musical chairs feels like a death sentence. Here, the kids aren't playing Fortnite-they're secretly working for Satan.No happy ending, sorry. The final twist hits like an uppercut: you see it coming, but it still knocks you out. Ethan thinks he's solved the mystery? Too bad, buddy-he realizes too late that he's just kicked open the gates of hell. And when that final reel starts spinning, you'll be screaming, ""Of course it ends badly-you're in a horror movie, damn it!""Sinister isn't just a horror movie-it's terror therapy. It throws oppressive sounds, disturbing visuals, and Ethan Hawke spiraling into madness right in your face. The result? A nightmare on screen that reminds you why you should've picked the romantic comedy instead.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
High expectations - still satisfied!,"The last time I went to see a horror movie in the cinemas was when I saw ""Insidious"". While Insidious didn't deliver, this one did, oh yeah it really did!Its about a couple who moves to a new house because the father in the family wants to write another successful book. He is a famous writer who tells stories about crimes that hasn't been solved. In the new house he finds evidence on crimes that are too horrible even for a ""Crime-author"" like him. He struggles with his feelings about either calling the police or unravel one of the biggest crime mysteries ever.Actually I don't know why I had such a good feeling about this one before i stepped in to the theater. But my gut feeling was right!The best horror movie since paranormal activity! I think the main reason I liked it so much was because of the ending. Just as Paranormal Activity you sit with chills and pumping heart in the end, waiting for what will happen!Great movie! 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not Scary BUT Disturbing,"Sinister is one of the rare horror movies to come out in recent years that actually makes an impression on the viewer by being an original work and will be remembered. I'm a HUGE horror fan, but I have to face the awful truth time and time again that horror movies today SUCK. They suck so incredibly bad. With the exception of Insidious and now, thankfully, Sinister, every horror movie to come out of recent years is certifiable trash. Everything is either a remake from earlier successes, a remake of a more successful foreign film, a movie about demonic possession, ""torture porn"" (and I did love the original Saw) or a mash-up of every cliché imaginable overdone with cheap CGI. Sinister works because it avoids all of these.Instead of relying on cheap tricks, Sinister uses atmosphere, mood, tension and pretty good acting to heighten the horror. I didn't find the ACTUAL story all that scary; the ""deity"" didn't quite do it for me, but luckily, the movie didn't need to rely on it as its only means to produce scares. The one word that comes to mind when I think of Sinister is DISTURBING. It's not essentially a ""scary"" movie but a very dark and DISTURBING one. You understand this from the opening scene. The home videos that Ethan Hawke's character watches will definitely linger with you.Sinister of course isn't perfect. I guessed the ending almost right away and knew what was happening. And why doesn't anyone turn on a light when they hear something scary at night? TURN ON THE FREAKIN' LIGHTS! Your kid suffers night terrors and wanders around outside? Lock his damn door! Characters in horror movies are usually pretty stupid and don't do what they're supposed to do anyway so you really can't hold that against this movie. The ""pop-up"" scares were predictable as well.Even with silly flaws Sinister is successful because it goes back to the basic formula for making a genuine horror movie. Mood and atmosphere are scarier than any cheap CGI monster.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Great horror, really worth a watch!","If you hadn t watched this movie yet then I would really recommend it. Story of this movie is just so simple but on the other side very complex!Ethan Hawke is an incredibly talented actor who just suits this role perfect in my opinion. My rating might be high compared to IMDb overall rating, but I just see this movie as very interesting with all incredible jumpscares and tape videos. The end of the movie is quite unexpected, but I am aware that there is a second part (Sinister 2), so it probably sets a story for a second movie. (I have not watched the Sinister 2 yet but because of how good this movie is I will definitely give it a shot.)Really recommed watching it !!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great Start but sadly drops the ball,"I've got a soft spot for this Horror movie and I'm still confused how a production can be so great yet so bad at the same time.The first half of Sinister is one of the greatest build ups in Horror Movie history. Is this a hot take? Probably, but I really mean it. They always say, the fear of the unknown is the greatest fear there is and Sinister completely understood the assignment.Maybe it's a personal phobia of mine for these types of found footage style movies, but something about the expertly handled exposition and build up of tension just still gets me, even after years of first seeing it.Sinister also integrates the found footage trope in a very interesting manner into its story. Good stuff, more importantly, downright terrifying stuff.This makes it all the more frustrating, that the resolution to all of this build up is simply said just not worth it. I might even go as far to say that it's disappointing. It feels like it's two completely different movies that were stitched together halfway through. Almost like Blumhouse has taken note that there's a actually scary movie in the making with the potential to be one of the greatest ever, intervened and forced the production crew to fit in the status quo of other jumpscare fest productions.The first half alone is still worth to watch this movie and since I've got a soft spot for it, I can't go below a 7/10.It's always sad to see wasted potential.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Sinister indeed. Freezes your blood to inky black.,"It isn't easy to come across a horror movie that genuinely scary these days. So when a flick like the effectively creepy, gripping Sinister comes along, one must take note. It contains many of the tropes and tricks we see employed in countless cannon fodder horror duds churned out by folks that wouldn't know an effective scare from a hole in he ground. And yet, the makers of this one, especially the composer who I'll touch on in a moment too, craft their story in such a way that all of that feels fresh, organic and most of the time downright terrifying. There's such a thickening blanket of dread over the movie that I had to watch an episode of Wet Hot American Summer right after, just to undiminish the creeping fear that it set on me and ensure I could get to sleep OK. The plot is familiar within the genre: an edgy true crime writer (Ethan Hawke) arrives at a new house, where murders took place (which he doesn't tell his wife, the prick) with his family to document the horrors of the past for his new book. He discovers an old box of super 8 film stock in the attic, containing blood freezing, candid accounts of various different murders, each more panic inducing than the last. These tapes hold the core of what makes the film so scary: They're jagged, nightmarish POV visions of atrocities too unsettling in nature to mention here. Composer Christopher Young should be truly proud of his work here; the sounds he makes to go along with the films are beyond anything I've heard on film before, and resemble actual passages of otherworldy music floating through a rift from another dimension. As soon as he watches the tapes weird things start happening, of course. His kids get hellish night terrors, he sees things, and a malevolent forces encircles him and his family. The human drama and writing, an element which is tragically often left by the wayside in the horror genre, is excellent here, a particular standout being a third act fight between Hawke and his wife that feels realistically desperate, handled wonderfully by the duo. There's nice work form actor turned politician turned actor Fred Dalton Thompson as a cranky local Sheriff, and a cameo via Skype from Wilson Fisk himself, Vincent D'Onofrio. Seldom these days do we find a horror that really sends the creepin willies up your spine and hurries your walk from the dark kitchen to tour room at night by double time. To any movie that manages this for me: mission accomplished.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not perfect but close.......Definitely well worth a look.,"This is a really good film, good plot, good choice of 'murderer' and good idea for the Evil What/Who that possesses the 'killer'. I actually hadn't figured out who it was....which is a hard thing for a film maker to pull of...so, that's a huge bonus. There's lots of tension and creepy atmoshpere in the film, the brilliant soundtrack aiding that, so if that's what you're looking for you'll get lots here. I didn't give the film a 10 because the director/writer got the 'murderer' to act way too clichéd..?!! The over-acting is so hard to ignore it takes away from the impact. I'm also taking a point off for the scene where a thick branch of a tree is sawn off - from a distance - by someone using a little saw at the end of a long long handle! An impossibility. Also, though the characters bickered like any family, I didn't feel that these 4 individuals were family. There are a few more bad bits that I could point out but...let's get back to a major good point...the film left me wanting more. What's the story behind the evil Who/What....why did the killings begin...etc. So yeah I do want to see ''Sinister II'...even though sequels are never as good, but,...well, you never know...let's give it a chance.

One of the better horror movies,Sinister is a horror/thriller movie.This review has no spoilers.The movie follows a guy that writes books based on real-life murders or something.1st problem with this movie is the premise.I found it extremely idiotic but that wasn't a huge deal.The movie is really really really scary though.I mean seriously Baghuul is frightening on its own but the entire movie is just filled with great scares that don't focus on the Boogeyman.The tapes are also take a part in this movie.They are terrifying and really disturbing.The other issue that bothered me is the trailers that reveal too much of the movie.The movie has some issues that are minor and i won't bother explaining them.All in all sinister is a good movie that every horror fan must see.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the best movies I've seen in years!,"I don't tend to give unqualified praise often, but this movie was amazing. It was wildly atmospheric right from the start and while the images/ideas were very disturbing, it was never too gross to watch (which is a big hang up for me - I shouldn't want to close my eyes while watching a movie). But do be warned that the ideas are truly disturbing. This is particularly true if the idea of family violence is bothersome to you (my husband, for example, won't watch anything where people have to see/hear loved ones die). If you can get past that, you will be well rewarded. Ethan Hawke is amazing in this film as he vacillates between washed up, downtrodden middle aged writer and hot on the trail of something big alcoholic. He is so captivating that at a certain point you actually forget/don't care about the possible danger he puts his family in. And that makes the climax all the more enjoyable. Furthermore, this is not a film that is full of those ridiculous moments that horror movies are typically known for. Characters in this movie make exactly the same choices that I would reasonably make in such a messed up situation. It was quite refreshing to not have to spend most of the movie thinking that the characters are going to get exactly what they deserve for being so dang stupid. In fact, the only real issue I saw in the film (and it did bug me a lot), is that the whole premise is that in their new home Hawke finds an old school (50s-60s) reel projector with home videos. Even as a 40 year old man, the odds of knowing how to so skillfully work the old projector (not to mention hand splice the film) is a bit out there. Particularly since he sows no penchant for film in his every day life as a character. But perhaps that's just a back story that was never written in. I was certainly willing to overlook it given how truly terrifying the rest of the film was. It was worth every minute.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
More scary then quality movie,"I have to admit that I liked the story because it is rarely good in horror. Hawke is very good in the lead role. The film is very creepy and scary.

A great modern horror,"This is one of the few films I rate out of the modern horror era. In my view 80% of horror films have always been a little predictable. The new horror era has produced some absolutely awful films claiming to be horrors. Sinister however has a beautiful haunting muster that will linger with you long after watching.Sinister starts with Ethan Hawke and his family moving into a new house, where they are welcomed with indifference and hostility by the local PD. As we come to discover Hawke has moved his family into an old murder scene residence..Then finds a box of old 8mm tapes in the loft, the only thing left in the house...I've always rated Ethan Hawkes natural presence on screen and this role is perfect for him! He brings a sense of realism and grounding to the story and dialogue, making the film more believable, and thus, more intense.Sinister brings many beautiful film making aspects to achieve its end result. The lighting, editing, sound department all did incredible work and together, create an incredibly eerie atmosphere for our characters to exist in. The music from each 8mm lingers in my mind to this day..Don't miss this intense suspense horror.7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Endlessly creepy, well done","Deeply compelling, twisted, and interesting- Sinister may not hit every mark just right, but it is still one of the creepiest and most human horror films to grace the screens in the last decade or more. Scott Derrickson writes and directs the original horror flick, and does a pretty good job if I do say so myself. His other credited works before this film were not too much to be proud of, but I would like to see him continue to do this type of work in film in the future. The script of which he wrote with frequent writing collaborator C. Robert Cargill, is very well toned and very realistic. There are certainly many disturbing parts of the film, making it definitely not for the faint of heart. The film does struggle a bit towards the beginning, and a little throughout to get its concept on the screen in a perfect fashion, but what the film does so effortlessly is truly invoke the fear it is set out to make. It's a truly horrifying tale, with some great atmospheric work, and cinematography, and every little bit of the film feels like it means something, which I haven't seen in a horror film in quite a while. It may not harness its full potential, but Sinister has more than enough to keep it going rather strong throughout its nearly 2 hour run. It's never boring, or tiresome, and it's often very clever and unique. Derickson provides an excellent look and feel to the film, and I hope this will later be recognized for the often brilliance of horror it encompasses throughout.
My Rating: 9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Avoid the trailer, watch it cold & clench your buttocks.  Or watch the trailer and have the experience spoilt.","It was with great trepidation that I took my seat for Sinister. I often veer away from horror films, as frequently they tend to be less about chilling and more about shocking with gratuitous violence. No sensitivity required, just a strong stomach and a certain bloodlust. The likes of Hostel and the latter Saw gore-fests may have made mucho $$$ but were never going to trouble Oscar or satisfy a discerning audience in the way The Exorcist still manages.Oh, and I was clenching my buttocks even before the lights dimmed having read a fellow reviewer's comment: I have never heard a female audience member scream as loud as I heard last night...Oh, dear.Post event? Well, the midnight drive home through dark, winding country lanes wasn't the most fun I've had on my own but Sinister is nowhere near the terrifying experience that some would have you believe. If you've seen the trailer, you know what's going to happen, you'll know when the biggest shocks are coming and there is nothing left to be surprised by. If you haven't, I'd urge you to ignore the link above and go into Sinister blind and completely unprepared in order to benefit fully. When is Hollywood going to relearn the art of 'teasers' rather than feeding us 'show all the best bits' trailers that destroy the experience? Watching Sinister after viewing the trailer is akin to sitting through The Others when you know they are ghosts.Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) is a 'true-crime' writer whose success has dwindled. Close to financial ruin, he uproots his family and moves to a new home, neglecting to tell them it is the scene of the murders in his latest book. Oswalt then finds a Super 8 projector and spools of films in the attic. Spools of film that show grisly scenes. And then bad things happen. Very bad things.There is more than a whiff of Jack Torrance about Oswalt but that is almost inevitable given his career choice and location (author writing in a building with dark secrets). However, the hints of madness, the inner torture and the genuine fear with which Hawke imbues Oswalt are original and not lifted from another character. His determination that evolves into stubbornness, teeters on the edge of insanity and then tumbles into considered panic is real enough to feel from the safety of a cinema seat and highlights again the quality of Hawke. Perhaps true movie stardom has bypassed him but he consistently gives fine performances and is an actor who will paint multi-faceted characters for us to watch, admire and shy from for a great many years yet.The lack of impact from the supporting actors implies a heavy-handed editor or over-bearing producer. Juliet Rylance is given little to do as Oswalt's wife, Tracy, other than to react to his actions. Likewise, the children, Trevor and Ashley, feel as though there was more given to them that was consigned to the cutting room floor. Yes, they have an impact, they are important to the plot in their own ways but neither is allowed to develop fully. Upon arrival at the house, Oswalt verbally spars with the sheriff and we see the mutual contempt they feel for each other's roles but again, this left unexplored and the most we get is a cameo, that is almost humorous but never really effective, in the shape of a cop forever known as Deputy So-and-so.But, flaws aside, Sinister is a film of tension, a film that, given a dark room, no fore-warning and the right mindset, will really put the willies up you, not least of all for the soundtrack. The music frequently feels little more than moans, screeches and rhythmic noise that claws its way under the skin and scratches at the underside of your hair follicles.Inevitably, given the success of the Paranormal Activity series, writer/director Scott Derrickson (The Day The Earth Stood Still, The Exorcism of Emily Rose) has set Sinister up for both sequels and prequels. But with his next film an adaptation of Stephen King's The Breathing Method, it remains to be seen if he takes the easy money or leaves it to another b-lister on the rise. Regardless, Sinister is a film that currently belongs at the top of his CV.Now switch the light off, try to ignore the banging and creaking in the attic and sleep wellFor more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Oh! So That's What A ""Bughuul"" Is!","I'd say that Sinister was a perfect example of why I've now gotten to the point of absolutely loathing supernatural-horror movies to the max.Not only was Sinister's preposterous story a total insult to anyone in their right mind. But its plot-line actually expected the viewer to completely suspend disbelief for the sake of some predictable, 3rd-rate scares and a mess of icky gore.Sinister introduced such a ridiculous overload of implausible nonsense into its demented, little story that I'm convinced that its screenwriters couldn't have had anything but pure contempt for the intelligence of their intended audience. It was so clear to me that they obviously perceived the viewer as being just a stupid, gullible fool.It sure didn't help matters at all that every single member of the Oswalt family in Sinister's story came across as being nothing but an annoyingly dysfunctional misfit (especially Trevor). And, so, in turn, how could I possibly give a bloody damn about what sort of nasty devilishness eventually happened their way?",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Sinister,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, this film surprised me greatly. After watching amazing horror films like The Babadook, The Conjuring 1 and 2, and The Descent, I went into this film with low expectations and was thoroughly entertained. The story is dark, disturbing, and gruesome. The imagery used throughout the film is very scary and the tapes add to the horror. The plot twist was very good and the ending was frightening.The acting is mostly good. Ethan Hawke always performs well in every o=movie I have seen him in. Hawke is accompanied by Juliet Rylance, Fred Dalton Thompson, Michael Hall D'Addario, and Clare Foley who all perform well. James Ransone performs the worst because his character is dry and he can't act very well.The pacing is slow in some parts but it is mostly consistent. The runtime is a little overlong.Pros: Dark and disturbing story, the tapes, good plot twist, a scary ending, good acting, and Ethan Hawke's performanceCons: Some slow pacing, James Ransone's dry performance, and an overlong runtimeOverall rating: 7.0",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
By-the-numbers horror for morons.,"So full of gaping-wide plot holes... here are some:A writer moves into a house where a family were murdered without telling his family, and somehow they manage to embark on their lives there, kids start school, etc., without any of them finding out, not to mention the questionableness and unlikelihood of his doing this in the first place.The writer finds a box in the house containing evidence which, within what seems like minutes, leads him to link together a series of murders. Seemingly the police (and surely the FBI, given the serious nature of the crimes) totally missed this obvious box of evidence left right in front of them.A cop assists the writer all the way through, but never deigns to report the link between the murders to anyone official (!!!).The gaping plot holes are only the tip of the shitberg in terms of the problems with this turkey of a film.Don't let your intelligence be insulted!",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The tantalising mystery we discover alongside the main guy made me feel conflicted on whether I want to tell him to get out while he still can or to keep digging that little bit more to uncover the mystery.The other characters are pretty annoying but a lot of visuals make up for that.

Not bad but not great,"If you are thinking of seeing this movie you better do it while it is still in theaters, because if you don't it won't be anything too special. The movie plot is cool and interesting but very predictable. If you have seen the trailer for this film than you already know one of the key points to this movie, that being a re-occurring image that appears in all the home movies of different families that were murdered. However I was not over impressed with the ""scare"" techniques in this movie. I saw this in the theater and yeah i did jump and get startled more then once, but only because of the loud bang/sound or music being played when a scary sight flashes quick in front of the camera. I can imagine if I was watching this movie at home the intensity would not nearly be the same and I do not like the fact that if I wear to have the sound off or even low, I would not be scared at all by the scenes meant to make the viewer jump. Now I know a lot of scary movies used sound to intensify these parts but more of a sound that the killer/monster/ghost/etc makes... something that will always make you remember them, like the creepy noise the girl makes in the grudge, leather face starting the chainsaw, Freddy laughing, the voice disguiser from scream, things like that. That is something lacking in this movie, as I said before without the loud bang or sudden loud music the scary parts would not be scary in my opinion. As for the creepy face or 'Mr. Boogie"", he is scary looking and creepy but to me he resembled the jigsaw doll (saw) too much, or he may be a member from the band slipknot, which made me feel as though I was not seeing some kind of new villain. Having said that this movie has some of the most disturbing scenes involving the family movies shown on the film projector, which I think was twisted genius to think of. No problem with the acting and as I said before I found the storyline very interesting and was easily caught up in it. I give this a 7 with it losing points based on the fact that it was not as scary as I had heard or expected, but it is worth seeing, but I highly recommend that you see it in the theater, makes the experience more enjoyable and scary.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A chilling yet flawed horror experience,"""Sinister,"" directed by Scott Derrickson, is a horror film that brings an eerie atmosphere and spine-chilling moments. The story follows true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke), who moves his family into a house with a dark history to research his next book. As he uncovers a box of old home movies depicting various gruesome murders, a malevolent force begins to haunt his family.The film excels in creating a deeply unsettling ambiance, with Derrickson's direction and Christopher Young's haunting score amplifying the tension. Ethan Hawke delivers a compelling performance as a man driven by curiosity and desperation, adding depth to the character.However, while ""Sinister"" effectively builds suspense and delivers some genuinely terrifying scenes, it falls short in its reliance on jump scares and familiar horror tropes. The plot can feel predictable at times, and certain narrative elements lack originality, preventing the film from reaching its full potential.Overall, ""Sinister"" offers a decent horror experience with memorable scares and strong performances, but its predictable moments and reliance on clichés keep it from being truly exceptional.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Jumpscare does not equal Horror,"""Sinister"" falls short of expectations with a 4/10 rating. The film heavily relies on jump scares as its primary source of horror, which quickly becomes tiresome and predictable. While the cast does a commendable job with their performances, it's not enough to salvage the monotonous and repetitive nature of the movie.Jump scares can be an effective tool when used sparingly and strategically, but in ""Sinister,"" they become the go-to formula for generating fear. This reliance on cheap thrills takes away from the potential for a more nuanced and psychologically unsettling horror experience.Despite the actors' efforts, the characters lack depth and fail to engage viewers on a meaningful level. Moreover, the storyline feels like it's stuck in a loop, offering little variation or innovation as the film progresses. This lack of narrative development results in a tedious viewing experience that doesn't hold up well over time.In summary, ""Sinister"" may have had potential with its talented cast, but it ultimately disappoints due to its overreliance on jump scares and its inability to break free from a repetitive and monotonous storyline. A 4/10 rating reflects the missed opportunity to deliver a more engaging and thought-provoking horror film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The filming location of the movie was just a big house in the countryside. It was a very scary movie and there were many jumpscares, even though most of them were kinda predictable. The opening scene of the movie was definitely unexpected, very creepy and kinda disturbing. Also, the score of the movie was very creepy and the sound effects were definitely spooky. I have to admit, the plot twist was kinda unexpected, even though I had expected something way more shocking. Last but not least, the ending scene was kinda unexpected and it was definitely disturbing. Overall, it was just a nice horror movie, totally terrifying and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Fairly rote jump-scare-a-thon, never scary","I was underwhelmed by ""Sinister"". I have seen people describe it as the scariest movie they ever saw. It didn't scare me at all, and I'm not exactly hard to scare. It reminded me of those silly ""Insidious/Conjuring/Annabelle"" flicks, where the plot just seems to exist to hold up the jump-scares. And none of these were effective.It's a shame, because the movie actually had a pretty school story. Something to do with an ancient god who eats children, and a serial killer who wipes out whole families but always takes a child hostage, who is never seen again.It was also interesting seeing a main character who is a hack writer of ""true crime"" that people either love or hate. Even police are totally on board with helping him, or want him gone, apparently depending on whether or not you follow the fiction that he dredges up hideous memories of violent crimes to see justice being done, rather than to line his own pockets.All of this is lost underneath the style, that shows director Scott Derrickson totally believes in style over substance. Or perhaps he just didn't really know how to bring the subtance out through the style?",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great Horror Movie,I am writing this after watching the movie three or four times. The movie still gave the same feeling as it did during the original viewing. It is a great movie for horror movie lovers. It has everything one can ask for. The good thing is it doesn't stop at nothing. It does not shy away from things and goes for the ultimate. The performances of the lead actors were wonderful. Just go for it.,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Truly terrifying but long-winded.,"'Sinister' is about a crime novelist who moves his family into a new home to start his new book. He finds found footage in the attic which reveals a string of related murders. In every murder scene, there's a symbol and an image of a paranormal entity. So obviously, he starts to investigate; with devastating consequences.The trailer for this movie is one you see and go 'screw that, there's no way I'm watching it!'. And it definitely delivered the scares. It was terrifying. I've never jumped so hard at one of the moments in it. There was also loads of creepy and disturbing imagery, dark cinematography and PLENTY of jumpy bits. The only problem I had with it is that it spent too much time focusing on the footage and not enough action happening to the family. I don't know anyone else with this opinion but I definitely felt that way about it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Extremely scary film!  Very well done!,"I went into this movie not knowing what it was really about, but thought the trailer looked quite interesting. Having just finished the movie, I have to say that this is one of the most terrifying movies I've seen in a long time! Everything from the acting, to the environments, to the ambiance/ sound was just absolutely great! There were several times throughout the film that I felt true terror. Some good jumps, but most of all just an overall sense of uneasiness and horror. I wouldn't want to spoil this movie for anyone so I will keep it short and just say that I highly recommend you it! If you can handle a little bit of scary it's definitely worth watching! I recommend watching it with a friend or family member so that you can both be scared together, but at least have each other. And I can imagine this would be a good one to talk about.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
As far as being creepy and disturbing the movie really works!,"'SINISTER': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Supernatural horror film from writer/director Scott Derrickson and starring Ethan Hawke. The film has Hawke playing a true-crime novelist who moves his family in to a house where the previous family was murdered, except the youngest girl who went missing, in hopes he'll find material for another hit novel. Derrickson directed and co-wrote the film with C. Robert Cargill. He performed the same duties on other horror films like 'HELLRAISER: INFERNO' and 'THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE' (which is one of my favorites). This film isn't quite as deep or thought provoking as 'THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE' but it's a pretty effective and chilling horror film nonetheless.Hawke plays Ellison Oswalt, a true-crime novelist who had a hit book a decade earlier in which he also helped authorities solve a crime. The books he followed it with were not nearly as successful and now he's looking for another hit in the house where a family was murdered and the youngest girl went missing some months earlier. He doesn't tell his wife (Juliet Rylance) or son (Michael Hall D'Addario) and daughter (Clare Foley) what happened there. Upon moving boxes in to the attic he discovers a box left there with a projector and multiple reels of Super 8 footage inside. He discovers a recording of the family that lived there prior to them being hung from a tree on one reel and four other families being murdered on the other reels. As he investigates further in to each killing he finds they're all connected and much more as it starts to drive him mad.As far as being creepy and disturbing the movie really works. The music (by veteran composer Christopher Young) is very haunting and effective and there are several startling moments which are definitely satisfying if that's what you're looking for. Hawke dominates every scene and Derrickson's directing is stylish and fitting. Derrickson's screenplay is intriguing as well but once it gets to the supernatural elements of the story it starts to lose it's effect a little and becomes a little clichéd. I found the film much more effective and disturbing when it was just about murders that were probably arranged by some deranged lunatic rather than some form of a supernatural being. Once a film like this turns to fantasy it seems less creepy and disturbing (to me). A horror film is much scarier when it's something that could really happen. Still it has plenty of great scares and memorable scenes and it works for the most part. It is a grade A production made on a budget of just $3 million so it's an impressive achievement by any measure. Fans of horror films should more than be pleased.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qTKOxmDvq0",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

RaTKiN's Movie Rants: SINISTER,"As his career is in a slump, a true crime writer is desperate to write another best-seller. He likes to be close to his writing subject, so he moves to a house where, unbeknownst to his family, terrible events occurred. It gets even more sinister when he finds a mysterious box in the attic, containing several tapes of 8mm film stock...Writer-director Scott Derrickson serves up a horror movie not unlike his previous scare-fest The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005) in terms of mood and execution. Through an exceptional and non-conventional soundtrack, the grainy and scratchy found film footage and the overall solid acting performances, Sinister manages to evoke a very chilling atmosphere, without feeling the need to resort to gore.The first Act does a good job setting up the characters and their conflicts. Even though their initial predicament is quite common in horror films, it doesn't ruin the uncomfortable eerie mood the film is going for and it offers some form of explanation for the choices certain characters will make. For some, this explanation may not be sufficient to suspend their disbelief later on in the movie, but I personally didn't find this to be that troublesome.My biggest gripe with Sinister is its structural repetitiveness. Starting from Act 2, tension is built and released at least five times in the exact same way: Family conflict/character development => Man watches some film and switches it off because he got freaked out by it => Man hears strange sounds in his house and sneaks through the hallway to investigate (these scenes are mostly too long) => Back to family conflict, etc.Generally, this kind of repetition would not be fatal for a sober, slow-burning movie like this one, if each iteration would present something new or if some kind of plot/character evolution is shown throughout. Sadly, except for the fact the strange phenomena get worse, this really isn't the case. This lack of fresh content makes for a second Act that feels much too long. It doesn't help that a lot of the tension build-ups end with the typical sudden movement - loud noise combo. Luckily, these cheap scares are supported by the feelings of dread during the moments that precede them. Ultimately, it's up to you to feel or decide if you can forgive the film for its ""easy tactics"".The middle Act is also where the ""face of evil"" is shown. I don't know how to feel about this. If this movie had different pacing, I'd probably say the enemy is shown too early and therefore loses all of its mystique. This rings even more true when make-up effects and creature design are rather uninspired, and you get the feeling you've seen it many times before. But in Sinister, I guess the relatively early revelation moved the plot forward in an already (too) slow-moving plot, so it didn't bother me as much as it might have otherwise.The third Act starts off with one of the characters making a decision that some viewers will say ""should have been made earlier"". As I said before, to me the initial character setup was enough to buy this character's decision-making, but I wouldn't be surprised if not everyone will feel the same way. While the movie really took its time in the second Act, it's a shame the ending felt pretty rushed. It deviates from the classic ""screenwriting 101: how to write a smashing knicker-soiling ending, the Hollywood way"", which will probably polarize viewers. I found it clever in some ways, and it certainly produced a smile on my face, as it was easily the scariest sequence for me.If you're not a fan of the genre, I doubt Sinister will offer you a rewarding movie experience. Gorehounds will need to look elsewhere as well. It's certainly not a terrible film, but it needs to rely too much on its atmosphere of dread. If you like your horror served creepy and slowly getting under your skin, with feelings of unease very aptly evoked by a great unorthodox soundtrack (check out the band ULVER) and grungy found footage sequences, and you can forgive the film for some of its cheap scares, then this film might be for you.There once were ten little rats, who went in their movie-hole to watch SINISTER.

Different horror experience,"Sinister was different horror experience for me. It had well written story, quality actors and a genuinely creepy atmosphere.

"A Good Movie, But Didn't Scare Me","Good movie Sinister is, but a bit disappointed that it couldn't scare me one bit.

The acting of some of the kids was poor - they overdid their creepiness a bit too much.The storyline was nice, the way everything came together was admirably directed.

"Not the worst, but not the best by a long shot","Sinister. Well I was looking forward to this film since I seen the trailer. Which drew shivers just watching. However this is where it stops. I saw this in an advanced showing and am so glad that I never paid for it. Its not the worst film that I've ever seen but more of a film that should have gone straight to DVD and not lure anyone into the cinema to spend there hard earned money to see. (or is that maybe the Scottish coming out in me). There are plenty of jumpy parts in the film. Mainly due to the volume being very quiet and then booming in really loud, rather than jumpy content. So I really doubt this film will have much of an impact at all if you were at home watching this on your telly. Now I am a bit of a hardened horror film buff. And really enjoy fast moving scary, creepy, blood filled, gruesome films which this does not fall into any of these brackets. Maybe to the more novice horror fan or easily frightened it might appeal but in my opinion give this a miss.

Great Horror Movie,"Me and my friend watched this while searching for some truly scary horror movie, so it fitted perfectly in our taste. The movie has a great story and plot and it tells it so good, we think that some subjects about the creature could have been more explored. About the scenes, all of them brings a very good storytelling and ambience about what's going on, and it's the best aspect of the movie in our opinion. Furthermore, the pace and emotions that this film brings along the watch time, fits perfectly, because they're not too fast and not too slow, plus the great composition of lights, shadow, silence and sound makes the scene's auras so much incredible. Therefore, its a great movie, some decisions about design makes me wonder why, but it doesn't hurt the core of the movie.

Enjoyable but highly predictable,"So being a huge horror fan, I went into the cinema with the thought that this was either going to be passable or laughable. An although it wasn't the latter it was barely the first.Dragged out in places and incredibly predictable its a typical movie of the present day horror genre where its more 'lets mess with your head' than 'lets build atmosphere and give you a good story line'.There are the usual popping up from behind doors, loud noises and mediocre 'scares' that most will find satisfying but are tiresome for horror fanatics like me.It had potential and i must admit the ending is enjoyable and slightly warped when you realise who the 'killer' is, but by this point the film is beyond saving and you'll be glad its ended.At home it will have little effect and should be viewed (if at all) in a cinema setting.Whilst leaving the cinema many said how terrifying it was and it was the best horror they had seen in years. I and many other horror fans will probably beg to differ.Good for some 'jumpy' moments but not for people who are expecting a decent horror",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Sinister is creepy at times but still delivers some cheap scares,"Just because something pops into a screen and makes a loud noise, doesn't necessarily make it scary. Most of us are more afraid of what we don't know. If you are on the edge of your seat because you are creeped out and you are anticipating something, but you aren't quite sure what that thing is going to be, then you are really scared. However, if you are anticipating a loud noise and then that noise that you are braced for actually happens, then you aren't scared at all. Predictable jump scares can ruin a movie.Sinister is the latest horror film coming out this weekend that stars Ethan Hawke. Hawke plays a crime novelist that has just decided to move into a home where a family was murdered. He is hoping he can uncover something about the case so he has a story for his new book. During his investigation, he stumbles upon some old super 8 footage in his attic. After watching some of this disturbing footage, strange and unexplained events start occurring in his home.There were parts of Sinister that I loved and then there were parts that I absolutely hated. There were moments in Sinister that were very creepy and I was genuinely scared. I was even thinking to myself, ""Finally, a horror movie that is actually scaring me without resulting to cheap jumpy noises."" Unfortunately, there are a lot of parts in Sinister, that lead up to cliché horror moments. For example, you hear a dull thud. The character goes to investigate and the music is slowly building up. He stops to peer into the darkness and the music comes to a quiet. After a long pause, BOOM! A face appears and a crash or a loud instrument sound erupts into your eardrums making you jump out of your seat. How many times have we seen that before? When you're expecting it, it's not scary.Jump scares make me furious. I'm not mad because the movie startled me; I'm mad because this is lazy writing. Anyone can throw a loud moment into a scary movie. It takes real creativity to come up with something that is truly scary and completely unexpected. Fortunately, there are some of those creative moments that a fan of horror movies can appreciate. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of aspects of this movie that I enjoyed. I was very pleased with the performance of Ethan Hawke. Also, the music in Sinister is awesome. It has an edgy feel to it and it really sucks you into the scene you're watching.Sinister could have been a fantastic horror movie and a breath of fresh air to a dying genre. The movie really did have a lot of good direction and great pacing with very scary moments. I will say that there are a tad more of the actual terrifying moments instead of the dull predictable moments making this more of a good movie than bad. For some reason though, the director decided he needed to throw in some clichés which may work for some viewers but will definitely anger the true fans of horror. B-",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Effective horror film,"Sinister is a classic horror story told with style. A family moves into town to live in an old house that was the place of a brutal tragedy some time ago. Now, in real world, this would merely bring the price down a little bit and that would be it. But of course in cinema world you can pretty much kiss most, if not all, of the family goodbye instantly, as all of you pretty much guessed the very instant I uttered the words ""old house"". This could very well be a Stephen King novel. It even has a writer as a protagonist. Yet I don't mean that in a bad way. It's an effective formula, if you can keep it from feeling too stale.Which Sinister does, for the most part. Much of that is helped by the lead man, Ethan Hawke, whose acting capabilities and charisma keep you focused on the film. The atmosphere builds largely around his growing unease and horror as he starts to realize that this time he might have found something real - without having considered what that would mean for him and his family.The rest of the cast does okay, but none of them stand out or really shine all that much. I have to wonder what this movie might have been if they had gotten another actor of Hawke's caliber.The other major problem is the ending, like it often is. The majority of the film is mood and atmosphere over slasher horror and jump scares, which is a major plus. There are a couple instances of both, but they're done well and you don't grow tired of them. And then the ending just sort of happens and it's not as satisfying as it could have been. I would like to say I don't mind it being predictable, because in horror the journey is more important, but I will say that it wraps up the loose ends a bit too nicely. There's no punch to it. I will remember Hawke's performance long after I've forgotten this particular ending.Sinister is one of the better horror films I've seen in years, which to my regret isn't saying all that much. It has a lot of good things going for it, but I get the sense that they just didn't manage to pull in enough talent to really make it work. Definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of horror, though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A truly 'Sinister' film.,"I found 'Sinister' to be impacting on the viewer, dark and it also required the viewer to do some thinking. To start off, the film doesn't go straight into pop up scares as others do. But it does what all good horrors do: it built suspense, it made the viewer be on the edge of their seat for the whole duration but and it made them wonder. It's a hard thing to do to make someone scared by a film but still want to watch more, to want to know what's going to happen; this is a powerful attribute Sinister obtains. I found the plot of the film very gripping and original in its own way. I think the acting is excellent in this film, as the main character is almost perfectly portrayed the fear and emotions someone would feel in that situation. If there was one particular seen I thought was most effective it would have to be the scene in the hallway with the box; I found this seen made the blood really flow. Also after the so called 'pop-up' had happened the audience were still gripped with what was going to happen next. As for the 'ghoul' of the film, 'Baghuul' I found that the scene with the photograph of the bush really shocked the audience. However, I must say that the desirable trait about him is not seeing him close up; this is what makes him intimidating, fearsome and terrifying. My one criticism of the film is that it's scarier to see him in the bush than in the attic. The attic scene gives the audience a cheap scare, whereas the bush scene gives the audience a feel of bloodcurdling dread. Other than this, the scene was one of the best horrors I've ever seen. It was well-acted with a good plot, spooky lighting and an excellent villain!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

As satisfying as a urethral swab.,"The trailer for ""Sinister"" promised a lot... and, like many films of the genre in recent years, subsequently delivered nothing more than a poorly realised ""stab in the dark"". Speaking of darkness- could a filmmaker be any more literal? Perhaps if the characters had managed to survive beyond a severe lack of cohesion and groundedness- apparent early in the film- by ever having a brilliantly constructed life-raft of ideas and execution to cling to, then I may not have been alerted to the gaping technical failings that ultimately dragged the whole thing under. The resulting power savings could very well earn ""Sinister"" the very first ""carbon neutral"" rating in film production- but unfortunately the intolerable lack of lighting does not a dark thriller make. Nor does it hide the fact that the makeup effects team obviously thought that black eyeshadow and a tub of clown white would suit the HD format perfectly! It does, however, provide a peaceful sleeping environment for the film's family for a majority of the film- regardless of various crashes, desperate yells, thuds from and around the ""tortured"" Ethan Hawke that would otherwise wake a coma patient. I like some of the ""events"" that unravel before the Writer's (Hawke's) eyes as he tries to piece together the truth of his predicament- but again special effects marr any hope for shock value from the get-go. I would like to offer Director Scott Derrickson, along with co-writer C. Robert Cargill, these tips upon embarking on another similarly charged journey;1. Hire one or more lighting technicians2. Hire special effects/ makeup people that understand horror beyond a halloween party3. If they don't get it at first, tell the actors who they are and how they are related to each other and the situation (i.e- direct them)4. Actually put Vincent D'Onofrio in your film (I've heard of ""faxing in"" a performance...but Skypeing??)5. Understand that without direction, or given enough rope, actors will resort to unrestrained externalism to get through6. Understand that grainy, super 8 filmstock and filters are not a remedy for the unforgiving microscope of HD7. Hire one or more lighting technicians8. Perhaps watch ""Poltergeist"" again to remember how masterful films are made.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

When I saw the trailer I thought this had some potential, I don't find many movies scary these days but the Paranormal Activity films I found to be pretty creepy, so I was really hoping this might be one to do it for me, alas it was not.

Not nearly as scary as you all made it out to be,"So I read a lot of the reviews on here before going out to see Sinister on the second weekend after it was released and these reviews got me all fired up to see it with all the ""scariest horror movie in a decade"" reviews. But alas, if these people find this movie one of the scariest movies ever, would they even be able to survive The Exorcist, the first two Halloweens (the originals), the first Friday the 13th, or most episodes of Paranormal Witness on SyFy? While I thoroughly enjoyed this film, with its inventive take on the too tired found footage genre, only once or twice did I actually jump in my seat and those instances were not followed up by much to make me scared. I have to admit, I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for something to happen, as this film is creepy and does a good job of making you uneasy, but by the time it was over I realized, ""I never really got scared"". If you are interested in a decent mystery with a ""sinister"" plot, thus the title I guess, and can take some somewhat gory images, then this movie is recommended. But if you are a true horror fan, don't go see this expecting to be scream out loud frightened or cover your eyes horrified. No real gore, no true frights, just an interesting story that in the end is a bit predictable but worth a look.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Pretty good,"This is one of the better horror movies. It has decent story, acting works (although the male lead wasn't really the best choice imo) and it's creepy enough. The sound fx is too loud but that is pretty normal in these movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Overall a good film.,"I had heard of this movie for a long time but hadn't watched it until recently. One of my good buddies always hyped it up a lot and said he loved it. After watching it, I would say the same. The atmosphere of just plain creepy is very well executed, especially by the very nature of the house they live in.
I'll be honest, the pacing at the end of the movie does seem rushed and the events that take place seem like they could/should have taken up a larger chunk of time. However, the rapid change of pace could be seen by some as exactly what the movie needed considering most of the film does move rather slow.
Generally speaking though, this movie is very well done and better than most horror movies that came out around the same time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Finally: one creepy horror movie!!,"Even though Sinister has a plot that will surely ring a bell to everyone (typical ""haunted house"" theme, spirits haunting children, murderer ghosts, etc), this time I can say that this finally works out. Sinister shows how you can make people feel really scared, while so many other movies failed to do so using the same setup. One of the most outstanding features of this movie are the sound effects, that will make you jump from your chair more than once throughout the whole movie. But that is not it, the story itself also holds a really creepy logic, and interesting too. The acting also is quite better than most of the horror movies we are used to seeing. To sum up, if you are looking for a good horror movie and you did not see Sinister, then you will not be wasting your time with it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Author Ellison Oswalt and his family move into a house that is the setting of his new book, and of a vicious murder.","This movie gives the horror genre great outlook in such a crummy time for film. Sinister manages to captivate the audience with not just the same old cheap scares most films do in this genre. They find the captivation in the story, which is rich and very moving. The twists and turns in the plot keep the viewer itching for more, and is satisfied by every event. My only bone to pick with the movie is that of its delivery. Some of the shots in the film are a bit iffy and could have been done to better represent what the story was looking to convey. The three aspects to this film are the mystery, terror, and horror. I think it might have done better had it been classified as a mystery suspense film. I know some viewers like their blood and gore, but a greater number of audience member could have been engaged with this story that had great potential. The terror was done extremely well and was intensely built.I would strongly encourage those that enjoy horror films to go and see Sinister. It will not be a let down. I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 only if I had felt a little more of the terror aspect of the movie as to the horror. Other than that Sinister is a great film and the actors were magnificent. I encourage you to see it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Good but classic,"First of all I want to say that it was a good movie. The scenario was very good but the end had a lot of unanswered questions.The flow the first 50 minutes was very slow but the last hour was very good with very fast flow and very interesting comeback! Ethan Hawke had a solid performance in this movie and I believe that he is all the movie! I had seen the trailer and I was expected something different but I believe it was a good classic horror movie with 4-5 very scary point that makes you want more.If you want to see a good horror movie this is a good choice but nothing special and innovative, just a good American horror movie to spend your time entertaining. The only difference with all the classic horror movies is that this one is a 110 min movie and not a 90 min :) Anyway I admit that is one of the best movies lately and i hope to see more such films like this one in the future",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scary in a different way,"This movie was great, it's not like the stereotypical scary movie, it wasn't full of jumpscares and had more of a eerie vibe to it rather than a scary one. Really recommend this if you hate movies with jumpscares!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Sinister Sinister.,"There isn't many actors that can stand alone in a horror movie. Ethan Hawke manages just this. Although his character has a family, Ellison (Hawke) spends his waking hours in solitary confinement, or rather, his office, writing a book about a murder that happened in the house he currently resides. His wife and children are kept out of the loop, therefore, they are the ones to suffer. A sinister presence lurks in the shadows, waiting to tear Ellison's family apart. This is gorgeously shot. Ironically the nasty, scary hubbub happens when the sun's gone down. The house is populated by shadows and dim lights. You'd think Ellison would turn a light or two on. The story is strong; governed by a murderer that's been killing since the 60's. It's down to Ellison and Ellison alone to discover the truth. 8mm videos are his only source, and they're highly disturbing, and not for the faint-hearted. Sinister's shocks come with such perfect precision. It's scary, but mostly jumpy. Hawke is superb, becoming a nervous wreck the deeper in to this case he gets. Liqueur is his only company because his family manage to sleep through all the chaos that occurs. Sinister is a great horror, and will be remembered for its shocking material and creepy killer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""Sinister"" is a masterful study of dread.","Don't be fooled by comments from random viewers who say this movie isn't scary. It works its way into your head and, aided by Ethan Hawke's intense and convincing performance, it will follow you into your nightmares. It's not surprising in fact that the screenwriter based the story on a nightmare he had after watching ""The Ring,"" itself one of the most disturbing horror films ever made. The central conceit of ""Sinister""--that physical images, whether drawn, painted, photographed, or filmed, can have a life of their own--is ripe material for our media-saturated society. The idea that merely seeing an image will cause the viewer to be possessed by it is the stuff from which every child's nightmares is born. Hawke's character is obsessed by the horrifying images he sees on the 8mm films, but like us, he cannot look away from them. Like the girl who climbs out of the well and into your living room in ""The Ring,"" ""Sinister"" insists on the power of the photographed or filmed image to come to life in the mind of the observer; because we are watching along with Hawke, we are ""infected,"" as is he. ""What has been seen cannot be unseen,"" as the wise saying goes; images live on in the memory, at the very least. And one of the film's most brilliant features is the masterful score, which at times brings to mind the repetitive industrial clacking of machines in motion--relentless and unstoppable--whether it be the sound of typewriter keys, the rotation of reels in a projector, or the maddening rhythmic thrumming of your beating heart on a sleepless night.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
You cannot process 8mm film,"This films major hurdle is that the temperature sensitive 8mm colour or color film which needs specific room temperature chemicals that oxide in storage and expire cannot be purchased in the 21st century or manufactured as it can only be done by Kodiak which stopped processing it 2010. As technicians would check the processed image would have immediately called the authorities and FBI after noticing disturbing images of murder on celluloid so why have they tried to put this idea onto film. Most likely their jumping onto the Japanese Horror Franchise ""The Ring', with the deadly VHS tape, again even less likely as not everyone would use Video tape and most like use DVD, Blu-Ray or Netflix as their putting on quite a lot of horrific stuffSuper 8 can be processed in Black & White as monochrome film will result not colour/color but is easier to do as colour processing requires total darkness as I used to process it myself years ago and it was very difficult as you had to maintain 37.5 Celsius.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Genuine scary movie,"The first movie since I was a child that actually scared me. This movie produces constant dread with a few shout out loud surprise scares. (I did not scream. A lawyer in his 70's does not scream. Those were high pitched shouts.) Ethan Hawk, who does a good job with any part he takes, plays the washed up author who had one best seller too long ago. Desperate to repeat success, he moves his family into a house to write a book about the prior residents who would up handing around the tree in the back yard (literally).

Wasn't Bad at All,"Saw this movie when it first came out and I'll be the first to admit it was not a bad horror movie by a long shot. There is an excellent tension established early through the movie that lasts throughout. The story line is decent and Ethan Hawke does a super job bringing his character to life. As for the rest of the cast its pretty much a hit and miss even the children I find hard to believe are real at times, but then again their young and learning and they managed to keep the film going. The only true downside I'd say is that if you've seen the trailer you've pretty much seen all the jump scares the movie has to offer. I mean a scene would start and I would go, oh this is when so and so happens... so your never really surprised though it doesn't lessen the fear. My theater was pretty much halfway full of boyfriends and girlfriends and the girls screamed pretty much every time a jump scare happened. The guys on the other hand seemed to find the movie funny rather than scary, I don't know if it was a macho thing or what, but I personally didn't see anything funny especially towards the end. By far the SCARIEST thing about this movie to me was Bagul. I give total props to the design team and everyone who made that deity come to life because from the first time I saw him I was terrified of him. That mask or face or whatever is truly chilling and throughout the movie you hope you don't see him. The movie is far from Insidious scary and won't cause you to lose sleep, at least it shouldn't, but its definitely a good movie to get a few chills in or to bring a lover to and cuddle up with. I would definitely suggest seeing this movie in theaters as I think watching it at home will make it lose its luster I definitely don't think it will be as scary unless you have some serious sound systems going and a decent sized screen. Well worth the money and I'd give it a solid 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
scary and original,I went into this film not knowing much about it and was pleasantly surprised at how good the film is I am also shocked that the movie is rated as 15 as the story and concept is pretty disturbing to say the least and I personally would put it in the 18+ bracket. The scenes are well shot dynamically put together and executed well although some of the acting could be better. This is a must see movie for fans of the horror franchise and will keep you gripped till the end of the movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie to under 18s though as although the movie itself is left to the imagination the story itself is truly disturbing best watched with the lights out and surround sound the movie is a total gem and looking forward to a sequel if they do intact do one,9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
had a lot of potential,"I watched it a long time before and decided to rewatch it after watching a YouTuber mention it.The movie had a lot of potential but it was disappointing at the end, it is not a bad movie in fact I really liked the mystery at the start and found it to be scary however a lot of stupid bad decisions were made by the protagonist, like why can't you just turn on the light when you know or suspect there is someone in the house! Is he trying to save utility bills?!! Nonetheless, it made me shiver and I even jumped on a few scenes probably because of how it was filmed and the music that was playing in the background sadly it didn't last to the end, and I also found the ending very disappointingIt is still worth giving it a try if you have not watched it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Fails to deliver in every way!,"This movie was just plain terrible. The movie was predictable in every aspect and gave the same tired cliché misdirections.

I found nothing wrong with the acting, I thought that was the strongest part of the movie. The problem is that the story line is so weak that is overshadows the acting. I don't think any actor could carry this movie. I haven't looked at who directed the movie, but I'd be surprised if any of their past movies were successful, at least in this genre.

Acting superb yet the predictable ending binds my hand for a six out of 10 for this movie. But still it will come to my top 10. But cant defeat my craze about The Orphanage movie.

A good time passer but as time passes you won't remember it,"One thing I can guarantee you as a movie goer, this film will not bore you. I was expecting to sh*t a brick or two while watching this movie kinda like I did with Insidious.However, No bricks were shat.The movie kinda hits you over the head with the fact Ethan Hawke's character has not written a successful novel in awhile. In fact, I believe 5 people on screen within 10 minutes make some remark along the lines of ""hey so are you gonna finally write a good book this time"" Once you get past that though the story is fast paced fun from there on out.If you have seen the trailers for this movie then congrats...you have just viewed about 90% of this movies scariest scenes. This movie could have been one of the scariest films known to man if it really wanted too with crazy pop outs of Bagul and all that but for the most part they play it pretty casual and I respected that part. The problem is the couple of times I did jump in this movie were all from just loud sounds and not from anything in the plot. The movie wants to be scary but to horror fans you really aren't going to get much more then some Paranormal activity type scares here.The reason I do give this movie a 7/10 still despite it not being that scary is because it was entertaining. It does not take 50 minutes to set up the story and build up character development. This is a fast paced cant wait to see what is next film. Where it falls short is how it is handled. Etahn Hawke investigating who Bagul is and the links of the murders is what made this movie entertaining. This film would have been talked about for years if it had been focused on Hawke being more of a detective and the back story of who/what Bagul is and who the murdered family's were and all that good stuff. Instead we get mild at best scares,loud noises and stupid children running around the house attempting to be scary all while a very entertaining investigation is being thrown on the back burner.Sinister is more thrilling then it is scary. It is a fun film but for people familiar with the whole ""show creepy thing but don't show too much of it because its super scary to leave stuff to peoples imagination"" genre, I highly doubt you will walk away from this film genuinely scared.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""A projector that goes whirr in the night.""","Ethan Hawke plays a crime novel writer, who had a terrific novel. He moves to a house in a small town, and the sheriff pays him a visit, letting him know he is not welcome in the town. The reason is that he solved a case that the police messed up. He moved into a house where four people were hanged in the backyard, but didn't tell his wife about the murders, which is not a good idea. In the attic home movies show up in a box, and he starts to look at them. It includes a film of the hanging. He starts to become obsessed about the murders, and starts to uncover what he feels is a pattern. The house creaks, there are dark scenes, and the projector starts up in the middle of the night, without anyone around. One night, it seems that someone has broken into the house, but naturally he doesn't turn on any lights. The first two thirds of the movie is really intriguing, and gets one into the sense of the movie. To say anything about the last third would give spoilers, and one will either nod in agreement, or throw up their hands. It is well acted, and effective at what it sets out to do.

Come on. It is cheap to rely on darkness for half your scares, and even cheaper when it accounts for almost all of them. To me, a movie is far scarier when the frights come with the lights on. At a minimum, at least have the lights actually on under normal circumstances when normal people would have lights on. Ugh. Beyond distracting.
