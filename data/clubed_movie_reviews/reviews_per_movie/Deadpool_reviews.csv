Absolutely hilarious but not for everyone,"""Deadpool"" is absolutely hilarious. The story isn't groundbreaking, but it does the trick and the same goes for the action which isn't bad either. The greatness of this film lies in its humor and its uniqueness. It isn't like every other superhero film. Whether you talk about the constant breaking of the fourth wall, the R-rating, or any of the very different characteristics of this film that differentiate it from other superhero movies. To be frank, it's arguable doesn't even justify the ""superhero"" stamp. It's something different.It needs to be said, the film might not be for everyone. It's very crude and it's filled with nudity and violence. The humor won't appeal to everyone either. It's quite dark sometimes and very satirical. Sure, ""Deadpool"" isn't for everyone, but to the right audience, it's a masterpiece. The humor is great and there are countless hilarious jokes throughout that will make you laugh. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for Deadpool and he does so well in the role. It is a truly great performance by him.To sum up, ""Deadpool"" is a great film that might not be for everyone. I recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"""Please don't make the super suit green...or animated!""","One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humour) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.Never have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it is a masterpiece of all comic book movies I did have fun watching this movie. It's a film that fans wanted and got.I can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and has made the character of Deadpool his own. He was terrific as the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.The writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.I'm so happy that this movie is rated 18 and not some watered down movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated anything less then you really don't know the character at all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One of my favourite comedy's,"I really enjoyed this movie and I didn't expect to, I don't really enjoy a lot of 'superhero'
movies so I didn't have high hopes , but this movie was amazing. It was funny, violent and action packed. A really good thing about this movie is that it was different to a lot of comedy's , which easily could've made this movie a disappointment.

"Dirty, funny, sexy, violent and unabashedly romantic: Deadpool has arrived!","I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.Despite all my praise, it's not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he's not a hero) justice: but it's a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it's actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we'll hopefully see more of them in the future.Many people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I've grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there's a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it's ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.As it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"""Bad Deadpool - Good Deadpool Film!""","If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.As for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!""Deadpool"" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
This is what it looks like when filmmakers take risks,"Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
a much needed breath of fresh air in a stale genre,"At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show up, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years.The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. In typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in Deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like feel, in a good way.Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero film. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times in my SECOND watch).As for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placements were well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is important in understanding the story. Final rating 10/10 this is a great nominee for movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever made",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I am NOT the target audience for this one...please keep this in mind as you read.,"I am a 53 year-old man...and the target audience for ""Deadpool"" is much, much younger. So, it's not all that surprising that I wasn't bowled over by the film like so many younger people I know. And, when I am not as enthusiastic about it, understand that I am writing my review mostly for folks who are NOT huge fans of superhero films. Sure, I've seen more than my share but I am growing tired of the whole genre. And, while ""Deadpool"" deliberately avoids some of this, it's STILL a head on assault to your senses due to all the action and explosions...my primary reason for not being a superhero fan. Yes, there are tons and tons of explosions and action...that left me pretty cold...as did some of the ultra violence. What I did like was how Deadpool occasionally broke through the fourth wall and talked to the audience or made commentaries about superhero films...that I really liked.

A movie too conventional for an unconventional anti-hero,"Let me just say off the bat that I liked this movie overall. The action and the humor were both very good, and Ryan Reynolds nailed the role of Deadpool.With that said, Deadpool, the infamous anti-hero known for constantly breaking the 4th wall and just overall being unconventional, is stuck in a way too conventional movie that doesn't take enough risks. Deadpool in this film is very much himself, and there's plenty of R-rated humor the usual PG-13 Marvel film tries to avoid, but in the end, the film gets bogged down by a typical 3rd act finale (the weakest point of the film), another forgettable Marvel villain in Ajax (possibly the worst),plus the typical supporting characters like the love interest and goofy sidekick. It's all a little too conventional for such an unconventional character in Deadpool, and the movie suffers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Funny, entertaining and refreshing","I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory, unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only.Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization.Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"It is a good 6.5 or 7 movie, but 8+ is overrated","Just watched it and would say it is a bit overrated. And definitely should not be in top 250.

Marvel should say thanks to the fan-boys. At first i liked the humor, but it was repetitive and turned boring to me. Looks like Marvel has got the key mantra of success after Iron Man and GODG. Just add some humor, some cheeky action, some sarcastic abuses and here you get a blockbuster. In the end i would say it is not a bad movie, but not something to be in top list. i will give it 7 stars out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Unpopular Opinion: This film isn't that good.,"The long awaited Deadpool is finally and with its much talked about ""hard R"" rating. Starring Ryan Reynolds as a quick taking, fourth- wall breaking, insult throwing, masked superhero, we hear about how Deadpool became Deadpool told in flashback sequences, while simultaneously following a present day plot as well.The question for the average movie goer is ""Is this film really as good and as raunchy as everyone says?"" No it isn't.I don't mean to ramble much so I'll start with the good, this film does have some humorous moments and most of the supporting characters are very entertaining to watch. And yes this film also does have some good action sequencesSadly, that is where the good ends. This films tries very hard to be edgy and raunchy, as well as claiming to not be your average Marvel film because of those following reasons. But let me assure you; This film is most definitely very similar to all of the other Marvel films. By saying ""fuck"" a few times, showing breasts at a strip club and throwing childish insults such as ""dicktits"" is not smart filmmaking or screen writing. It is easy adolescent humor. This film has a simple plot that is easy to follow and is spoonfed to you. I have seen good comedies and I have seen good superhero films and this excels in neither.In this films defense it may not try to be anything other than feel- good-fun-turn-your-brain-off type film, but that within itself is lazy filmmaking. I shouldn't have to turn my brain off to have enjoy a film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Well, blow me!","Let me say at the very beginning of this review, I loathe super hero movies. I can not stress that point enough. For me, watching anyone of the countless driveling movies which have been pumped out by studios in the name of entertainment over the past decade is, for me, akin to having teeth pulled. Painful to say the least. My friends however are addicted to every single bombastic franchise, and through sufferance, I've endured countless hours of mind numbing boredom watching yet more Lycra-clad numpties saving the earth from ridiculous threat (there are of course exceptions to the above; 'The Dark Knight', the original 'X-Men)I was once again convinced that spending an evening with chums watching Deadpool would be an excellent waste of my time. I envisaged 15 minutes of feigned interest, followed by an hour 45 of updating my email and some cheeky online shopping. Well that new Morphy Richards kettle and toaster are still waiting for me to purchase as low and behold, shock of all shocks, this film is bloody marvellous!! Bloody, hold your knickers cause they are about to get blown off, marvellous!The dialogue is witty, sincere, and delivered by every single actor with a naturalism which seems more like improvised off the cuff genius, than drab scripted nonsense.The pacing of the movie is excellent. It held my interest through its entirety.The actions scenes directed with the skill of a more seasoned director.I was so pleased that for once, I was being forced to watch a movie that treated me like an adult, with adult humour and themes, made for adults.

"Not MCU, but still great","Or maybe you like it even more for not being part of the other Marvel movies. Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially the X-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never read the comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my Playstation. And I did think it was hilarious.The ""wink wink"" humor of it, is not everybody's taste of course, but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this, leaving behind the ""shame"" of being ""green"" (another Superhero he played, not as successful, if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you will find many things to like.

Dead pool,"Silly fun film, but also not great. I can see why it's overly hyped and the parody-like humour was intense and far fetched. Although I enjoyed the humour, I found it pretty silly and unconvincing for mostly being filled with sex scenes and nudity, foul language or sexual puns, sarcasm and blood. I couldn't really take the film seriously.I also got the sense that the screenplay tried to break ""stereotypes"" with men and women and whom is more acceptable to ""hit"" in a fight. Also, the mutant girl seemed boyish and mean, while Colossal was sensitive and polite. Plot was strange and never had a glimpse of how Deadpool's girlfriend was coping with his sudden disappearance. Character development was quite poor overall. It was difficult to focus on the story since the humour and gory torture scenes were the main atmosphere. There were no triggers or signs of mental trauma after being abused, but I still appreciated Deadpool's happy persona and his fight against cancer.I was also quite shocked at the nudity scenes and even seeing Stan Lee appearing as a cameo in a strip club with naked women. I don't think this is true to Marvel's legacy and the meaning behind their superhero/villain movies. Yet, it appealed to a certain audience and I guess it was a ""money-maker/parody/Let's shock audiences"" type of film rather than being focused on Deadpool's character. They even had to create a short origin story halfway through the movie to reframe the storyline and basically says ""Oops. There, there, ya happy now?"" Talk about being distracted.I normally enjoy Ryan's movies, but it's almost as if Ryan Reynolds himself directed and wrote the entire script. Nothing serious and characters had nothing to hold on or relate to. Deadpool had a greater chance for more creativity and depth, but the ""fast entertainment"" was the only potential. I still enjoyed the film and also because I love the X-Men franchise.

"Meta breaking 4th wall, juvenile humor and CGI action, with Iron Putin to save the day","What mythology and stories about Gods were for the ancient Greeks, the superhero movies are for 21st century Hollywood. There is no contest in which one is better, though a handful of Hollywood superhero CGI action cows stand out and have some substance, like Joker 2019, original Superman movie, Dark Knight etc. Deadpool is not to be appreciated on such grounds, but on the other, lesser forms of originality, entertainment and sheer nonconformism in the realm on the industrially produced commercial action flicks, from which it does stand out.What the movie has is lots of extremely juvenile jokes and rapid if not always quick wit of an unrestrained and lustful teen imagination, then over the top 4th wall breaking, in addition to the usual CGI animated flashy and senseless action. But to top the cake, we also have a cameo by what can be best interpreted as an Iron Putin, which would add a subversive layer that probably was not even intended. But in order to upgrade this silly flick, I am going to interpret it that way nevertheless.Deep this movie is not. Amusing, certainly, in a pretty juvenile way. If you stretch it, it is even subversive.

The pacing is quick and sharp, the screenplay by Rhett Reese & Paul Wernick is fantastic, the explicitly violent and gory sequences are, well, gory, and the on-screen chemistry between characters and we, us... the audience, is genius. Breaking multiple fourth walls and walls within walls, Reynolds has given us the 'Merc with a mouth' we all deserve.This is an origin story, but it realises this and drifts completely from the usual formula or story arc used in superhero movies. Instead it kicks off with Wade Wilson as Deadpool, in a taxi, with a mission. To find the guy that messed him up. Then, as the film progresses, Deadpool tells us how he became who he is. It's very unique, and it's one of the things I really appreciated about this film.The original music score by Tom Holkenborg aka Junkie XL is perfect. The synthesisers incorporated fit the character of Deadpool with absolute ease. It's not used to extremes, but you notice its presence. More notably, the soundtrack is brilliant. It has some classic tracks intertwined into the story, reminiscent of Marvel's Guardians Of The Galaxy back in 2014. This just adds to the chaos of Deadpool on his road of rampage, quite literally.The visual effects and set designs are substantial, I felt the main CG characters were nicely handled, and rendered into the surroundings really well. But I felt a lot of the overall CG versions of set pieces could have been worked on a little more, just to smoothen it out. The opening credits are perfect. Very fun, unique and amusing. The animation is spot-on.I really had a lot of fun with this film, and I believe it's the best Marvel has offered, period. Everyone involved has done a terrific job bringing the beloved Deadpool to life, and it has paid off big time. Bring on the (now confirmed) sequel!One more thing I'd like to praise is the editing. I feel with a lot of action films these days, there are way too many sharp cuts that pull you from what's happening. Editor Julian Clarke has handled this outstandingly, with longer shots so you can really focus on everything that's progressing on-screen. This is a good thing, but I really wish the overall cut was longer. Maybe they'll be a special cut for the home release.You're probably wondering if there's the usual 'Marvel post-credits scene' and of course, there is. It's a little different, as you'd expect from Deadpool, but it's just as brilliant as the film itself. You have to wait until the very end of the credit roll to see it, so sit tight. It's worth it. Also, there is a Stan Lee cameo, and it's hilariously planned.My verdict; Deadpool is now my favourite on-screen Marvel character, taking over from Ant-Man. I believe Reynolds and Miller will have pleased the many fans that have been wishing this day would come... Come? (Oh, you're naughty.)Deadpool, 9/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

How a superhero movie is supposed to be,"Ryan Reynolds is the embodiment of the Deadpool character. He did an absolutely awesome job and made the movie as epic as it is. In my opinion his sense of humour perfectly matches that of the original character. Before watching the movie, I was a bit afraid the story of Wade would slowdown the roller-coaster ride, bit it is nicely scattered throughout the movie. Not so much to lose track of the original storyline and not too little to be oblivious of where the superhero comes from. I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more if more of the Marvel universe was pulled into the story, but I'm not completely sure of it :).

Best Marvel movie ever,"I enjoyed every minute in this movie. This will become an instant classic and one of the best movies Marvel has made. From the first scene i was blown away. If you are 12 or older i highly recommend you watch this movie. I can't say more without spoiling the movie so go see it. I was at the cinema with my girlfriend and she is not a Deadpool fan, but after she saw the movie she wanted to buy the Deadpool comics to learn more about him. This is how good the movie was.

Chimichanga time!,"Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. It is the eighth installment in the X-Men film series. It follows Wade Wilson who, after being subjected to an experiment that leaves him with new abilities, hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his life.From the studio that inexplicably sewed his *beep* mouth shut the first time, comes... Deadpool. It may not have been the superhero that Hollywood wanted, but he's certainly the one they deserve. After years of speculation as to whether or not everyones favourite anti-superhero would actually get made into a standalone picture, Tim Miller's Deadpool has arrived. Do not let the February release date fool you, this is very much the film that both fans of the character and Ryan Reynolds have been waiting for. Full of comedic snark and constant fourth wall breaks (and Inception style fourth wall breaks within those), it delivers every bit upon its promise, a truly entertaining ride from start to finish. Minutes into opening credits, you are gracefully dropped into the self-aware world of the film, with notable credits such as ""directed by an overpaid tool,"" and ""produced by *beep*hats."" If that does not sell you on what kind of comedy Deadpool brings to the table, then you can always catch a screening of Zoolander 2 next door. When it comes down to it, Deadpool is one part vendetta film, one part romantic tale a la ""Beauty and the Beast"" style. This is the role that Ryan Reynolds were born to play. It's been a passion project for the actor for many years, and it shows. He is to the Deadpool franchise (the sequel were already planned ahead of its release) what Robert Downey Jr. is to Iron Man. You cannot imagine anyone else possibly playing the role. Erased from memory is the X-Men Origins: Wolverine version that Reynolds played in 2009. What a relief. The tie-in to the world of X-Men is somewhat limited aside from the inclusion of Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead. I will not saying more. At the end of the day, Deadpool's re-watch factor is sky high, possibly the most important success of them all. I'm touching myself tonight.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Over-hyped average movie which tries to be funny.,"This movie is not awesome. It is a one-time watch only. I don't know why people are so hyped about it. This movie just tries to be too funny yet it doesn't succeed always. Comedy in every 2 seconds in the movie becomes annoying eventually.Nothing new. The editing was nice. Music was good. Some scenes were funny. But the movie was predictable. I predicted what was gonna happen next in the movie and I was right. The most foolish line in the movie '' Did I leave the stove on ?''.

Deadpool: Early review. Kicking off the 2016 superhero flicks in a big bad way.,"Deadpool is the movie equivalent of the parents going out of town for the weekend while the high school throws a party, gets drunk, has sex in the backseat of the car and then pukes in the driveway, and in a good way. It appears as though Fox has turned a blind eye while director Tim Miller, star Ryan Reynolds and screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick run amok, having the time of their lives and thankfully bringing us along for the ride.Deadpool stars Reynolds as the mentally unhinged hit-man, Wade Wilson. This is not a story where the upstanding protagonist is flung into the throes of an extraordinary situation. No, this superhero tale about an unstable bad guy who gets superpowers, and it's refreshing as hell. Without getting into spoiler territory, this is a revenge movie masquerading as a superhero origin story.Following what may be the most creative opening credits sequence in the history of film, we are flung mercilessly into the maelstrom of Deadpool. Once the light turns green, all bets are off as Deadpool takes us through his journey, explaining his origin, his revenge mission and even his unconventional, if at times endearing relationship with his girlfriend, Vanessa, who may be as, or more, damaged than Wade himself.There really isn't anything bad I can say about the movie, except that I was sad when it ended, but they were able to cram just enough crazy into this 107 minutes that it just works perfectly.I plan on watching movie at least three more times.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Deadpool is an unfunny drudgery that brings nothing new to the table,"I've heard it again and again over the last few weeks, people keep saying that Deadpool brings something new to the superhero genre. The problem with this claim is that no one seems to be able to tell me what it is that is so revolutionary about this flick. Is it the dick jokes? The fisting jokes? The prom sex jokes? The face sitting jokes? So revolutionary. I suppose it's necessary to say that I am no prude, and that I take no issue with those types of jokes, other than the fact that they just didn't make me laugh. The humor in this movie just reeked of desperate immaturity. The jokes seemed aimed at the middle-school-boy-who-lurks-on-Reddit-crowd, which is, thankfully, a frame of mind that I have long since moved past. The ""humor"" often felt like it was trying too hard, as if it was screaming at the top of its lungs, ""LAUGH AT ME! I'M SO HILARIOUS!"" And if the humor doesn't work for you, which it did with many people at my screening for some reason, then there is really very little for you there. The beginning credits of the film call the writers the ""real heroes"" of the film, an assertion that I must wholeheartedly disagree with. The movie is remarkably light on plot and what is there has been painfully rehashed from every superhero origin story ever. The non-Deadpool characters are all paper thin, none of them are given sufficient arcs to make them interesting. Even Deadpool himself is not entirely interesting. He begins the movie the same way he ends, smarmy as ever, violent as ever, wanting the same things he did 1 hr and 48 mins ago. The saddest part of all of this is that because this movie made so much money, there will be a sequel, as well as many worse rip-offs of it that are even more cringeworthy and forced.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"""Shh - my common sense is tingling""","Wanna know what reading a Deadpool comic is like? It's like waking up pants-less, ferociously hung over, and covered in a variety of cuts, bruises, and condiments, but then getting to eat a big stack of pancakes off the back of the hooker still sleeping next to you. Or, it infects your brain enough that those are the sort of similes you're liable to cough up. And yet, for the reigning king of contemporary nerd humour, who plays like a cross between Kick-Ass and a Canadian Guardians of the Galaxy (smaller- scale and more belligerent), it's been surprisingly agonizing bringing everyone's favourite chimichanga-chomping Merc with the Mouth to the big screen (and you'd better be wearing the brown pants if you bring up that X-Men Origins garbage). Thankfully, Fox's common sense was tingling. So, fans: think long and hard (snicker) about the uncompromising, mostly amoral, full-on bonkers Deadpool movie you'd lacerate any limb for. Your wishes have finally been granted.Debut director Tim Miller manages the impossible: a film quintessentially built on fan- service that doesn't suck. It's appropriate that Deadpool has borrowed DMX as his theme tune (at least until the George Michael kicks in), because this crudely charitable spirit ebbs throughout the flick. Want some deliciously profane, sex and hyper-violence-stuffed whimsy, replete with a Guardians-calibre hilariously on-point soundtrack, and the comic's fourth wall-shattering snark integrated in a way that's actually funny? How about daring to dream even bigger: a big studio production that mercilessly pokes fun at its skittish budget cuts, the former cinematic bungling of the titular antihero, and even the requisite Hugh Jackman appearance in every X-Men spin off - even the magical (jizzing) unicorn of a superhero origin story without waiting an hour for the lead to appear in costume. Want all of that? Wade gon' give it to ya.But don't make the mistake of dismissing the film as a feature-length meme: Miller is savvy enough to understand there's more to Deadpool than quips and dismemberment. Sure, the plot is about as flimsy and insubstantial as anything, but, like a messier, crunchier Guardians, that's not the point. The point lies in the emotional and character beats, where Miller delivers in Wadeser, spades. Like most of cinema's funniest, Deadpool's psychotic humour roots in real pain, and Miller doesn't shy away, lingering on the physical and emotional pain of Wilson's cancer and his multifaceted torture in attempting to cure it through forcible scientific mutation to a genuinely uncomfortable extent, to ensure that neither plays as gratuitous.But lest you be feeling goth enough to slink off to the premiere of Blade III, the film's real surprise is yet in store. For all the gleeful irony of its Valentine's Day release, Deadpool is a surprisingly heartfelt, hilarious and tragic romance at its core. Yes, really. Only the most 'Pool-schooled readers would recognize that peeling away the irreverence, pancakes, and phallic samurai swords reveals a hugely self-conscious, sentimental sap within, but Miller is clearly one of the initiated. Appropriately, some of the film's most charming, hilarious, and devastating scenes involve Wilson daring to let his guard down enough to fall in love, and, like a reddit-rattling Phantom of the Opera, too crushingly ashamed to reconnect after his superpowered facelift leaves him looking like, as T.J. Miller's Weasel puts it, ""an avocado had sex with an older avocado"". This is about as profound as the character ever really gets, but there's poignancy and pathos to be gleaned from Wilson's grubby fumbling at sentiment, and Miller and Reynolds nail it here.But don't worry - we're still miles away from the doom 'n gloom of the average contemporary superhero austerity, and their generic 'all the CGI sets crumble' climaxes. Sure, Deadpool being pared down to three action sequences does draw attention to its comparatively tiny budget, but in this age of bloated superhero excess, seeing fights kept this lean is a godsend in itself, even if it weren't clinched by a not-so-subtle hysterical recurring gag justifying their sparsity. Still, we're hardly left wanting: the fights are short, snappy, creatively ultra-violent (""count the bullets"" being the most meta and thrilling), and stylish as hell, just as they should be, while fellow X- folk Colossus (flawlessly animated and finally Russian; a hilariously po-faced foil) and Brianna Hildebrand's amiably sulky Negasonic Teenage Warhead allow for some buddy banter and help keep the action beats bumping all the while.There's no secret that Deadpool is the Ryan Reynolds show though, and his burning passion for the character fuels a now career-defining performance. Imbued with the divine gift to make even the crudest riffing gleam with cheery, sparky charisma, Reynolds nails each beat of wacky humour, springy physicality and seething, volcanic rage and hurt so effortlessly there's the uncanny feeling of him dripping ink from being lifted off the pages of a comic. Despite having to combat a disappointingly under-written part, Morena Baccarin matches Reynolds in adorable damaged snappiness, steering just shy of sultry, manic-pixie-dream-girl stereotype by keeping the right amount of crazy in her eyes. T.J. Miller is consistently hilarious and uncompromisingly unsentimental as Wilson's buddy Weasel, while Ed Skrein as ""that British villain"" brings enough pompous, brawny sadism to make his Francis-ahem- Ajax only feel slightly generic. The under-used Leslie Uggams is perfectly salty as Deadpool's crusty roommate Blind Al (not an abductee here), making a recurring IKEA joke surprisingly sweet. Meanwhile, keep your eyes peeled for half of Vancouver in the background; we're all in there somewhere.I'd waste time with more adjectives, but you get the idea, and can use a thesaurus as well as me. Basically, Miller and Reynolds have delivered the most cathartically satisfying cinematic Deadpool imaginable, sure to capture the hearts or slice off the heads of diehards or inductees alike. Dead2l soon, please. WHAM.-9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Just non stop jokes that mainly fall flat (NO Spoilers),"First off, I do not read comics so I do not know the source material, I am not a fan-boy of Marvel or DC I just want to see entertaining movies, I may be in the minority at least during it's first week of being in theaters but I wanted to write a review to warn others what Deadpool is like.The movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially. I am fine with low brow humor when it is funny. The writers just seem to have Reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny. I think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes. There is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor. It is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumb.The plot is nothing more than a simple background (origins) story and it is run of the mill. The movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative. The movie is very similar to Super and the Kick Ass movies. However, those movies were superior to Deadpool on every level IMO. The movie also reminds me of the Vacation remake. The 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funny.This movie may just be better for younger audiences but I still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source material.I give it a 2 out of 10. It gets an 2 instead of 1 only because Morena Baccarin was a side character. She did the best she could with the limited material.Dean",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Summer fun in February!,"Hooo boy! The year has barely started and already we have shots fired. In the battle to earn your comic book movie love (And dollars) Marvel has come charging out of the gate. After a dearth of comic book films last year Deadpool comes out swinging giving us a reason to love the summer again and it ain't even March. The film begins with an ambitious opening scene, the credits of which, perfectly set the tone of the movie from the get-go: funny, irreverent and self-aware. Marvel appears to have adopted a doctrine of making their films be entertaining (Imagine that!) above any other concerns and Deadpool seems to be a culmination of that philosophy. It is a testament to the skill and commitment of Marvel and the makers that they can get so much mileage out of one second tier character, and half the budget, than other companies can with four first rate ones, fantastic or otherwise. (Way to redeem yourself 20th Century Fox!) Not bad for a character that was a created as a joke. (For the non-initiated, Deadpool started life as a blatant clone of Deathstroke, a character from DC Comics, Marvel's main competitor.)In all this the film is aided in great part by a crackling script that never lets up. Whereas too many action movies treat the scenes between set pieces as filler packed with exposition and the occasional comic relief, Deadpool deftly weaves between wise- cracking slapstick, violent acrobatics and scenes of serious peril with effortless ease. The result of all of this is a movie that is engaging throughout whether featuring profane, brilliant banter or graphical, bloody shootouts. For the film wears that R rating proudly with enough sex and violent to make Paul Verhoeven get all misty-eyed. It is not surprise there is already a sequel in the works.Another revelation here is Reynolds himself who in Deadpool seems to have found his Iron Man, a character so indelibly linked to the actor that plays him that you cannot imagine anyone else playing him. And his work here acts as vindication of that whole Wolverine debacle which we won't mention ever again. But the secret ingredient in the Deadpool stew is geek heroine Morena Baccarin, who, besides being cute as a button brings the acting chops honed in fan favorites like Gotham and Firefly or even as the darnest adorable reptilian alien ever in the short-lived ""V"" reboot. Baccarin has the perfect easy-going confidence to match Reynold's sardonic bravado and their superb and convincing on-screen chemistry provides the impetus for Deadpool's heroic arc.For despite all the foul language, gore and masturbation jokes, this is a story that is surprisingly tender. It turns out it wasn't just a marketing gimmick and, Deadpool, really is a love story. To be sure, one with more severed body parts than your average love yarn but a love story nonetheless. Starting a new franchise is always risky and studios hate taking risks. Whatever your stance on comic books is, the fact remains this movie should not have been this good. The writers and director have shown what can be achieved with bold writing and an unapologetic attitude, and, more importantly, that comic book movies need not be made for kids to be enjoyable or, indeed, successful. Here's to hoping that trend will continue. Hopefully Hollywood will take notice.Parent's BriefRated: R Running Time: 108 minutes On Sex and Violence: Plenty of both. There is graphic violence of the gratuitous kind. People get shot in all kinds of places and I mean their bodies not exotic locations. Limbs get bloodily cut off. A lot of foul language which I don't mind but I'm not here to judge. Deadpool and his love interest get into some vigorous love making and elsewhere there is some brief frontal nudity. Boobies. Boobies are shown. So yeah. Don't take the kids.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"The r-rated spiderman, who exceeded all expectations","Deadpool is a controversial character with many X-Men-fans hating him, because of his rivalry with Logan and a lot of critics first thinking that the humor ad violence in the trailer scenes seems artificial.
But with its release the movie, which had arguably one of the biggest impacts in 2016, has proven, that with the right actor, who was undoubtedly Ryan Renolds, you can keep up the action, while creating a unique atmosphere through the constant black humor and satire.
The movie is making fun of other movies as much as of itself with its 4th-wall-breaking, while Ryan manages not only to play Deadpool but to define Deadpool.
The film starts with an action scene grasping the viewer tightly from the beginning. The action scene is like the others equipped with insane-looking filmmaking techniques. From there on the movie continues with its unique time-jumps to then explain the beginning of the story in which Ryan manages to build one of the best love stories in superhero films for years on the way with the help of Morena Baccarin as Vanessa. Thus creating a deep emotional ground for the viewer to watch the following drama grow.
In these scenes, the villain ""Francis"" as Deadpool would call him, is introduced. The following plot is rather basic, but what many don't realize is that the movie isn't trying to have a unique plot because Deadpool tries to follow these cliches so that it can make fun of them.
Also, the humor, that many feared to be artificial, has a very different effect, when experienced in the movie in contrast to as it looks like in the trailer, because the trailer isn't showing how these situations came to be, which is always done in a very natural way, justifying it perfectly.
To conclude you can say, that the movie has amazing production techniques, acting, and pacing. Although many think, that it was the best film of the year, there are people, who don't get the charm of the film.
If you are interested in this kind of humor and satire you should watch it because the chances of you getting the charm of the movie should be high then.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Not for everyone, despite the high scores","Rather than tell you whether I liked this movie or not, I'll try to tell you what to expect, and you can make up your own mind if you want to see it.Story-wise it's really not that interesting: Punk gets super-powers but because of how he acquired them he holds a huge grudge against the person responsible for giving them to him. Revenge ensues.This is the introduction of a new Super-character, Deadpool, from the Marvel Universe. There's plenty of action, much of it gratuitous and with ridiculously violent and cruel one sided slaughter scenes of people with no super powers.The most entertaining action of course is when adversaries are evenly matched, and whilst there is plenty of this too, the villains are ultimately hopelessly outgunned and that puts a cap on the potential for a nail-biting climax.The dialogue: Deadpool wise-cracks his way through the 108 minutes. Sometimes he's genuinely funny, but mostly he talks fast to keep things from slowing down. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, and equally there were others that were just embarrassing in their vulgarity.What makes this film different is that Deadpool knows he's in a movie and takes time out to joke with the audience. It's an interesting move for such a high budget film and generally it worked out pretty well.The target audience is undoubtedly male, from 16 to 25. Teens are going to love it but there's probably not enough story there for everyone else and it's just too violent for anyone under 16.This is a movie of our time, violent with a wayward moral compass.

Not your average superhero,"For those who are familiar with the character Deadpool, this film does him justice. For those new to the character and his story, you're in for a treat. Needless to say, I was excited about seeing this movie for the first time. As a character, Deadpool is the embodiment of comedy, parody, and slapstick while still delivering a satisfactory level of gore and mayhem. Ryan Reynolds gave his character a new, refreshed life which was much needed after his unfortunate and painfully inaccurate portrayal in X-Men Origins: Wolverine.If you love the action-packed Marvel universe but also crave a healthy dose of humor and a surprising amount of heart, then search no more.

"Good, but not without its flaws","Wade AKA Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) tells the story of how he was subjected to painful experiments, now with mutant abilities he seeks revenge.Deadpool is a superhero movie unlike anything before it. First off it's extremely R-rated. Second throughout the film the main is constantly braking the fourth wall, not mention there are some great jokes about the studio.Deadpool has LOTS of comedy, but with comedy being very subjective I personally felt this movie was very hit-and-miss, though when it hit it was hysterical.Next the story, its nothing outstanding, a simple predictable revenge story, the villain is really nothing special.Last the action, it wasn't as awesome and exciting as I was hoping, there was an overuse of CGI, given some scenes required it, but still, it feels faker looking then other CGI heavy films I've seen. Early on there are some pretty crazy action scenes, but the further the film goes the duller the action got.I personally feel this film was perhaps rushed? More time could've given them the chance to focus on crazier stunts and in the least a more balanced sense of humor.One last note, the one reason Deadpool actually didn't meet my expectations was that I kept hearing how this film was setting the new standard for R-rated films. I don't know what those people mean, I've seen movies push the envelope way more.In conclusion its worth a laugh, but don't expect anything Oscar-worthy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

The Fourth Wall is broken too many times and him knowing he is in a film is also one of the other factors ruining the film. The scripting is terrible and the jokes are poorly written.

Unconventional comic book movie that is bound to annoy and frustrate tame, unadventurous viewers: check.Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a former Special Forces operative turned mercenary who protects women from would-be stalkers.

His life is shattered when he discovers that he has multiple organ cancer. He undergoes an experimental procedure to cure his cancer but the serum injected by Francis aka Ajax (Ed Skrein) proves to be torturous and life changing, leaving him with special healing powers and a disfigured face. Not wanting to upset Vanessa, Wade leaves her and lives with a blind woman named Al (Leslie Uggams). With the help of X- Men Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) and Colossus (voice of Stefan Kapicic), the masked vigilante Deadpool as he is now known, seeks revenge and will stop at nothing to acquire a cure for his disfigurement.The opening credits such as 'Directed by an overpaid tool"" played over the song ""Angel of the Morning"" by Juice Newton are a precursor for the unconventional comic book antics to come. There's flashbacks, flashbacks within flashbacks, the protagonist talking to the camera, raunchy sex scenes, nudity, excessive profanity and extreme violence including severed body parts, all features that you don't expect from a comic book superhero. People expecting the 'normal' movie based on a comic book will be disappointed. Let yourself go and you're going to have some fun.Ryan Reynolds makes up for the atrocities of his previous portrayal of a comic book character in The Green Lantern. He's in excellent form here, showcasing his comedic talents which even include poking fun at himself. He lives and breathes the part of Deadpool and is sure to please fans of this 'superhero'. The in-jokes involving the X-Men characters are just one of the many highlights of the unorthodox comedy strategy employed by the writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wenick. Credit must also go to the director. This is Tim Miller's first feature length film. He is better known as a visual effects artist and it's evident in his direction how much he knows about this field. Even the CGI creation in Colossus is a character you have to admire.Ryan Reynolds gets most of the best lines. The other human characters are adequate more than exceptional. They are merely pawns to Ryan Reynold's King. There are a few flat moments when the over- the-top humor doesn't always work and the violence becomes gratuitous. And of course if you're a prude, you won't be feeling comfortable during some of the scenes.This is unlike any superhero movie seen before. It's definitely not for the faint-hearted and those who are easily offended. It's a fresh take on the comic book movie genre, breathing life and vigor, and most importantly, making up for the disappointment of the previous Marvel movie in ""Fantastic Four"". http://mlaimlai2.wix.com/magical-movie-review",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I generally hate super hero blockbuster films...,"... but this one is different. It's certainly not for the kiddies with its sex and violence. But here are not a bunch of ""all for one"" people with super powers trying to save the world. You have one guy for whom things have gone terribly wrong - metastatic cancer in multiple organs. He's promised a cure, but is double-crossed by the guy who promises to save his life - he does . However his face and body are disfigured by scars by the treatment. The worse side - he is to be made a slave and enrich his healer. So after breaking free, ""Deadpool"" is off to find the guy who did this to him and get him to undo it - he claimed he could. In the meantime he's not averse to killing everybody who worked for the guy if they can't answer the question of where he is.What's so marvelous about this film is that Deadpool is so human. What's fantastic about it is that he is a smart mouth extraordinaire. It's like House, M.D. meets Iron Man. He doesn't want to save the world, he wants to pound his tormentors into the pavement. And the film is constantly making fun of itself. When Deadpool meets the X-Men he mentions how they could have afforded more and better X-Men with a bigger budget - a little swipe at Fox studios which had no faith in this project that will probably net them a billion world wide.And finally, who would figure that a girl who takes her clothes off for a living would be Tess Trueheart? Highly recommended, but only if you have a tolerance for all of the stuff that comes with an R+ rating.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Wild, irreverently funny and unique. Don't miss ""Deadpool""!","Sometimes a movie's very first scene perfectly sets the tone – and serves notice that you're about to have a unique cinematic experience. Allow me to illustrate by describing the opening sequence to the big-screen adaptation of Marvel Comics' ""Deadpool"" (R, 1:48). We see a single moment frozen in time – the inside of an SUV as it flips over on a busy highway. In slow motion, the camera travels through the vehicle documenting the precarious (and humorous) positions of various bad guys who have gone airborne because of the crash. As we journey through this increasingly bizarre montage, the only sound we hear is Juice Newton's 1981 hit song ""Angel of the Morning"". We also see the movie's opening credits – not names, but tongue-in-cheek references to the actors and filmmakers, employing phrases like ""The British Villain"", ""The Comic Relief"" and ""Overpaid Hack"". Wild. Irreverently funny. Unique.Before he was the violent, wise-cracking anti-superhero Deadpool, Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) was just a violent, wise-cracking neighborhood tough guy for hire. (He's the kind of person you'd go to if you wanted to intimidate someone else into doing something for you – or just leave you alone.) Wade seems to have only one friend, a bartender called Weasel (T.J. Miller) until Wade meets hooker/waitress Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). They each have an acerbic wit, an irreverent personality and a messy life. In other words, they're perfect together. They fall in love, start living together and even discuss marriage. It seems like they're each as happy as they've ever been before until the other shoe drops. Wade suddenly falls ill and is diagnosed with cancer, which has taken hold in different parts of his body.A mysterious ""recruiter"" meets Wade at Weasel's bar and tells Wade that he can cure that cancer – and make him better than he was before. With no other options, Wade enters a secretive and ominous-looking facility where he is subjected to torturous pseudo-medical treatments designed to force his body to mutate. Wade emerges cancer-free, and with impressive strength and athletic abilities, as well as the ability to rapidly self-heal, but also with a face which Weasel says looks like ""a topographical map of Utah"" among other things. To hide his disfigurement, Wade makes himself a red and black suit and mask and adopts the name Deadpool, after the dead pool that Weasel runs for the patrons at his bar.Deadpool may look and move like a superhero, but the man behind the mask rejects that label. He's an anti-hero on a mission. Deadpool is out to find Ajax (Ed Skrein), the man who, along with his assistant, Angel Dust (Gina Carano), ruined Wade's good looks – and force Ajax to fix what he messed up. With a decidedly anti-superhero attitude, Deadpool (gruesomely) kills anyone who comes after him and tries to stop him. Two other mutants (a large metallic man and a teenager who can release powerful bursts of energy from her body) try to get Deadpool to join them and their fellow X-Men. No dice. Deadpool is a solo act – only interested in getting his complexion fixed so he can reunite with Vanessa and (besides Weasel) only associating with his old lady roommate, Blind Al (Leslie Uggams).""Deadpool"" is not your father's superhero movie (or your son's, for that matter). As much as we all enjoy a good superhero flick, the whole R-rated anti-hero/superhero thing is a refreshing change of pace. The script (by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick) is witty, hilariously self-referential, and the conceit of Deadpool breaking the fourth wall works surprisingly well. Under the guidance of visual effects guy – turned director (FIRST TIME feature director - !) Tim Miller, we get some great action sequences and visuals (despite the production's incredible shrinking budget), a story that's fairly simple and easy to follow (despite its non-linear presentation) and a main character that's faithful to the source material.Although you may have your doubts just reading through the list of actors in this film, it's actually perfectly cast. Skrein and Carano make a great villain and henchman (henchwoman), respectively, Miller is a terrific weasley friend, it's wonderful to see Uggams back on screen (especially since I kinda thought she had died) and Brianna Hildebrand (as Negasonic Teenage Warhead) as well as Stefan Kapičić / Andre Tricoteux / Greg LaSalle (who, respectively, provided the voice, body motion-capture performance and facial motion-capture performance for Colossus) brought a lot to their mutant roles and left me wanting more. Maybe most surprising of all, Baccarin made me forget her many famous well-dressed small-screen characters, like the stressed-out former POW's wife in ""Homeland"" and the devious otherworldly leader, Anna, in ""V"". Then, of course, there's our star. Reynolds plays his character like a combination of Bill Murray (in ""Ghostbusters"" or ""Groundhog Day""), Daniel Craig (in ""Casino Royale"") and Bruce Willis (not as the incredulous superhero in ""Unbreakable"", but more like his heroic but mortal somewhat heroic anti-heroes in ""Die Hard"" and ""Hudson Hawk""). That all may sound like kind of a mess, but the sensibilities of those characters joined with Reynold's natural charm make for a winning combination.But don't just take my word for it. Let the data be your guide. This film started breaking box office records (albeit very specific and obscure records) as early as its Thursday night previews and Friday opening day. Still not convinced? Here's an idea – see the movie! Even if you don't like it, at least you'll know what everyone else is talking about. You'll also be ready if you get dragged to the sequel, which Reynolds/Deadpool announces in a post-credits scene. Of course, no one can guarantee you'll like ""Deadpool"". After all, it's ""only"" a superhero flick and it isn't exactly Oscar material, but I, for one, can't remember the last time I had so much fun at a movie. And, after all, isn't that the point?

"Anarchic and hilarious: Introducing Mr Pool, Dead","How the hell do you review a film like Deadpool? It's almost in a category of its own.Ryan Reynolds is no stranger to superhero pics: he played the disappointingly limp ""Green Lantern"" in 2011 and before that he played this character - Wade Wilson - in ""Wolverine: Origins"" with Hugh Jackman (who is the butt of one of the many in-jokes in this film). Reynolds, as heir to Bradley Cooper as the pretty boy of Hollywood, has never really found a break-out role but here, hiding behind a face that looks like ""an avocado had sex with another, older, avocado"", he achieves true stardom: a franchise that looks like it could run and run. And he is very good in it too.In this 'origins' story, told partially in flashback, Wade Wilson, a fairly unpleasant mercenary bad guy ""who gets paid to f*** over worse guys"", has some bad news from his doctor. He tries to do the honorable thing by up and leaving tart-with-a-heart Morena Baccarin (Brody's wife from the first series of ""Homeland"") to go in search of a way forward. The superhero cure is offered by semi-super Ajax (Ed Skrein) but comes at a price (cue the guacamole) making it difficult for him to return to his lover. (Erm, so not a great morale boosting story for any burn-victims then?)Let's start with the script by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick - two of the guys behind the highly entertaining and anarchic ""Zombieland"". ""Deadpool"" sticks its tongue firmly in its cheek from the spectacular opening titles (the Director is described as an ""overpaid tool"") and the script bounces from great comic line to great comic line almost without a pause. As an example, Ryan says he wants to live until 103 and then die... ""just like Detroit"". LOL.Stan Lee cameos aside, some of the Marvel films can be quite po-faced and serious but this one comes from the more comic ""Ant-Man"" end of the stables. In general the script is highly disrespectful of the Marvel world it inhabits, with shots being fired at various sacred lambs, particularly the X-Men. As such, I'm not quite sure how some of the true fan-boys, (those who wear spandex under their day clothes), might react to this. The film makers are pissing on their 'reality' - albeit with love - from a great height here!In mood it is like the bastard child of a genetic experiment combining the genes of Spider-man, X-Men, Kick-Ass and Kingsman. As a viewing guide, if you really didn't care for the anarchic and violence-laced humour of these last two films then in all probability you really won't like Deadpool.I personally thought it was great fun, and a blast from beginning to post-credit end. The movie breaks the fourth wall shamelessly - something I often hate in a film - but gets away with it and even has the kahunas to have Reynolds address the fourth wall by making a joke about breaking the fourth wall! Audacious!However, my positive feelings are tinged with a feeling that we, as the audience, are all being 'had' to a degree. The whole thing is a bit overly smug. If Blackadder was writing this he'd describe it as being directed by Smug McSmuggerson, the king of Smugland. A recurring joke is the low budget afforded the movie, and we get hit over the head with that multiple times. It's all a little bit too knowing. The director is actually Tim Miller, and this - extraordinarily - is his feature film debut. But the guy clearly has class - this is off the back of him winning an Oscar no less for his animated short film ""Gopher Broke"".In summary, with curious timing, a surprise summer blockbuster while there is still ice scraping of windshield required.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

It's OK,"Well, they got the basics right: the jokes and the violence were quite what I'd expect when seeing one of my favorite comicbook-characters come to life. I had a lot of fun and the movie had the audience roaring with laughter more than once.However, the story and the way the other characters were portrayed couldn't keep up with that. It felt like they put in so much effort to make Deadpool really really Deadpool-ish that they forgot how crazy insane his usual story lines are and just used a 'superhero-movie'-template to make something up. I was disappointed by most characters too, apart from DP only Colossus (to my surprise) and Blind Al seemed to have some substance.Over all, I'd recommend seeing it, but keep your expectations low and just enjoy the fun.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Combining brutal material with childish humor yields a fun movie which is going to irritate more serious among you,"When a friend of mine first invited me to see Deadpool my expectations were quite low: I had known nothing about Deadpool and expected to see a classical super hero movie suitable for all ages which I usually don't enjoy. Little did I know Deadpool was a full blown comedy super hero movie made for mature audiences.Watching Deadpool 4DX was amazing experience. A scene where Deadpool jumps from bridge into a car was one of the most entertaining movie experience I've ever had! If only the rest of the movie was this good... if you're still somehow able to see it 4DX, don't miss the chance.Deadpol is very bloody with a lot of violence and mayhem. Language used is too obscene for my taste. Many conversations and scenes are very childish. The whole movie is very immature. Deadpool is going to strongly entertain younger audiences. So yes, Deadpool is pretty bold and quaint experiment: you have brutal violence combined with childish humor. For it's authors audacity I give it a seven. Objectively, it's more of a six.Still, Deadpool's delivery is pretty homogeneous. All the violence and mayhem fit nicely within the context fostered by Deadpool's character. Ryan Reynolds is the guy! He delivered much, much better performance than in Self/less. Morena Baccarin played Vanessa, Deadpool's girlfriend. And when I say she's Deadpool's girlfriend, I mean she IS Deadpool's girlfriend. If you've seen the movie you know what I mean. Let me mention that soundtrack plays a somewhat important role (Deadpool loves good music!) - producers picked good hits which contribute to milieu.

Waste of Time and Money,"This movie is a huge disappointment, and a waste of money and time. The jokes are stupid and I realize that Deadpool is not what it was cracked up to be. Too bad as I usually love the Marvel movies. It seems forced, and the jokes actually become tedious and not really with any sophistication at any level, more adolescent bathroom style humor. The story and plot is also dull and tedious which goes along with the dull and tedious jokes. At times I thought to walk out, but kept hoping that there would be a redeeming aspect as many of the reviews were positive, I kept hoping. This movie is more about money-making hype, with its non existent story/plot and childish humor with no depth. A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Exactly what the genre needed,"Deadpool is completely unashamed of its incredibly juvenile sensibilities which would've been enough to succeed in a genre so risk averse and completely afraid to show any violence or sex but what makes it even better is that it's a sincere love story deep down so it has real heart in between all the gleefully bloody violence and dick jokes. It's a meta parody of origin stories that also happens to be one of the best origin stories.Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool is perfect casting that puts him in his natural element. This proves why people deserve second chances because it shows Reynolds was born to play this character, regardless of the hiccup that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. He has an endless supply of quips that land constantly, especially the ones that poke fun at his own career and every 4th wall break is immensely satisfying.Ajax is a generic villain in the hands of the right actor to make it work. Ed Skrein has a gift for elevating one-note antagonists into something more memorable and that's exactly what he does here with a British bad guy worthy of an 80s action movie. Morena Baccarin's believable relationship with Reynolds keeps the heart of the film alive and Stefan Kapicic gives Colossus a wholesome nature.Tim Miller's direction is some of the most dynamic in the whole genre. It takes the comic book part literally with so many striking frames that feel ripped off the page from the very first frames which are as inventive and funny as the credits that serenade them. The CGI is really impressive because it looks as good as all the other superhero movies whilst only being a fraction of the cost and Colossus in particular looks fantastic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

It also does a great job fleshing out Wade Wilson's character, instead of making him a service-level comedian; they showed us his prior life and love life, and it was executed very well.

The same crap served on a different platter.,"Deadpool: The story of a movie with a poor storyline, which tries to be atypical using vulgarity, crudeness and nudity to distract from how typical of a super-hero movie it is.It's what you've been seeing for years, but it has been disguised and repackaged through means including clever marketing, shock-factor and being just-different-enough to make money at the box office. Audiences must surely be beginning to tire of this movie genre, and should not be fooled by the new wrapping and trimmings. Deadpool, while a solid movie in itself, is not the change that this genre needs but is different enough to entice mainstream audiences back (if they can stand the in-your-face overstylisation that has been relied upon to make this movie marketable).The Humour.......................................................... Not only are the forms of humour used in this film some of the lowest forms of humour, but also they have the effect of detracting from the movie's potential because they are over-used to the point of being tedious and because they take away from movie time which could otherwise be spent developing a quality story and purposeful dialogue. Gratuitous nudity, action and an over-commitment to being 'funny' are not going to leave any lasting mark in the film industry. Audiences may view that this was memorable, but this is likely only due to the shock-factor and should not be viewed as making this a ""Fantastic movie"" as some fellow reviewers have remarked.Induced misconceptions....................................... Audiences are sold a concept of a non-linear, alternative, less idyllic and exciting perspective on the warn-out ""Superhero Movie"" genre. However, that is a misnomer, a misconception induced by the Producers, the Director, and clever marketing minds. Mainstream audiences are fooled into consuming the same old crap they've been served for almost a decade now: Meanwhile, the discerning few who see the Deadpool character for what he truly is (a conglomerate of many of the characters we've been spoon-fed for years) are lead to believe that the dialogue is sharp and the humour is ""witty."" Also, audiences are lead to believe that the use of meta-cinema techniques (i.e Deadpool being aware that he is being watched) is a new or original feature of this movie,and makes this movie deserving of praise. When, in fact, the humour and dialogue relies on shock-factor and being over-emphasised in order to be effective, and the 'fourth wall' is only broken down for comedic relief. It's the Deadpool equivalent to the annoying cutesy/silly troupe that you are likely to find in a Disney movie - ironically the very same troupe that Deadpool Movie is trying to distance itself from. The audience can easily tire of this movie's over-the-top action, and over-reliance on low-brow crude or vulgar content which is disguised as wit through methods such as having the Deadpool character talk quickly or give dialogue at ridiculous times such as during a fight sequence.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
dead funny,"Former Special Forces Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is the good kind of mercenary. His best friend is bartender Weasel (T. J. Miller). He falls for equally irreverent Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). Their warped love story is interrupted when Wade gets cancer. Agent Smith recruits Wade for experiments. Francis 'Ajax' Freeman with his sidekick Angel Dust (Gina Carano) turn Wade into an immortal ugly superhuman. Wade takes on the identity of Deadpool as he hunts down Francis for a cure. X-man Colossus and his grumpy trainee Negasonic Teenage Warhead try to recruit Deadpool into the X-Men.Simply put, this is funny. Ryan Reynolds is built to play this smart-aleck, crude character. From 'Two Guys and a Girl' to 'Van Wilder', his early works show his truest persona. It's unlikely anybody else could play Deadpool quite as well. This is a non-stop, fast-paced, 4th wall breaking, no holds barred style of comedy. I guess a minority could object to its crudeness. There is a monotone to this style. That's why the funniest moment is the cabby's second ride. It comes out of nowhere. The shock and awe of it is hilarious. I like Negasonic and Colossus. Gina Carano again proves that she's no actor. Morena Baccarin more than makes up for it. All in all, this is funny and an action-packed superhero movie with a solid story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Lots of dick and jokes and blood, but that's not a good thing","Let me be perfectly frank. There's a very small market for the new Deadpool movie, and that seems to exclusively be teenage boys who enjoy the odd breast, decapitation, and curse word. While superhero films are all the rage today, Deadpool has always been a very niche superhero, and it seems to me like it won't exactly bring in the female crowd (although I could be entirely wrong about that), and it's rated R (mostly due to its gratuitous violence and nudity), so let's just nix the children right now. This leaves a very small window for the movie, but it's success depends on them, and I feel as if it WILL succeed, although it doesn't entirely deserve to.""Deadpool"" follows mercenary Wade Wilson (a typical Ryan Reynolds) as he is lured into some dark, dingy underground lab in order to receive experimental medical attention in order to cure him of his debilitating cancer. Of course, as if often the case with these superhero films, things to awry, and Wilson is left horribly disfigured, much to his chagrin. This leads him to adopting the Deadpool moniker and beginning his violent adventure to find and kill the man responsible (Ed Skrein). If this sounds overly- familiar, that's because it is. While the movie may want to subvert typical superhero expectations and tropes, it ends up being entirely unoriginal, which is definitely a downside to this otherwise well- intentioned film.It seems to me like the only thing this movie has going for it is its violence and adult-oriented content, but even that is highly unoriginal. I'm thinking specifically of what last year's ""Kingsmen"" did to the spy movie, or even what ""Kick-Ass"" did to this very genre. It presents an atypical hero in an atypical movie, full of blood, carnage, swearing, and nudity that you wouldn't otherwise find in a Hollywood blockbuster superhero film. ""Deadpool"" wants to market itself as a highly original film that's regarded as an intelligent subversion of superhero tropes, but it often falls into the very own tropes that it's parodying that it loses most of its originality and muster. While teenagers will undoubtedly gobble this movie up because it's filled with boobies and gore and swearing (and that's cool for teenagers, specifically boys), everyone else will find it a merely average, watchable movie that fails at its own ambitions.Ryan Reynolds is good in the role, as his typical sarcastic humor fits the character of Deadpool perfectly. It's also genuinely stylish, and some of the jokes are admittedly very clever and funny. I'm thinking specifically of the opening credits, where the usual ""directed by,"" ""written by"" titles are replaced by funny declarations like ""from this douchebag,"" or other, similar titles. It's an original concept, but unfortunately, the film loses its own way immediately after these credits and devolves into a typical superhero film, just with the odd severed head.For fans of dick jokes, this movie is sure to bring tears to the eyes. But dick jokes can only get you so far, and you can only tell enough of them before it starts to get tiring. Seriously, there's enough jokes about the male genitalia here that it could fill a book and become the Bible of dick jokes. But for anyone who isn't 17 years old, this can get very annoying and unfunny, as it often does. The movie aims for these types of jokes because it isn't what you'd find in a superhero movie, but the film overshoots its own goal and tires its audience out well before the movie thinks it's told enough of them. The same thing goes for the violence. We've seen enough bloody violence in cinema before that these instances are nothing new, yet the movie is so smug and so naive as to think that we'd be amazed at how subversive it is being. It's not. We've seen this all before, we've seen it better, and we've seen it funnier.In the end, ""Deadpool"" becomes what it is parodying. The movie wants to make fun of superhero origin tropes, but it becomes one in the process. Wade gets bad news, he becomes the guinea pig of some form of experimentation, he gets magic powers, and he fights his way to the big bad in order to stop him. The only difference here is that his path is littered with tits and severed heads rather than handcuffs. If that's enough for you, you'll be thoroughly entertained. For everyone else, maybe you'd best to rewatch ""Kick- Ass"" and ponder at what could have been.C-",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Violent, funny, foul mouthed, and plenty of sex jokes.  There's something you don't see in a lot of superhero movies as Deadpool is brought to life on the big screen.","To be honest I had never heard of Deadpool before. I briefly was introduced to his character in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) and save a lot of internet rumours that Deadpool was going to be made into a movie. Finally we can fast forward to 2016 and Team Marvel brings the titular Deadpool to the big screen with Ryan Reynolds anointed as the character. I was expecting it to be another superhero movie watered down to attract a wide audience, however upon viewing the red band trailer on YouTube, I found myself excited at the prospect that Deadpool was not going to pander to family friendly audiences. There's plenty of graphic violence, profanity, a strong sex scene, and plenty of sex jokes which is certainly not something I was expecting to see. Deadpool kicks all goals as a funny and exciting movie.Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a former special forces operative turned mercenary who spends his time protecting teenage girls from stalkers. Upon meeting Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), his life starts to look very bright until he collapses one night and is later diagnosed with terminal cancer. In fear of losing Vanessa, Wade starts to explore alternatives for a cure until he meets a mysterious recruiter (Jed Rees) who offers Wade to join his organisation as well as enticing him with a cure for his cancer. Wade reluctantly accepts but later finds himself horrifically mutated at the hands of Ajax aka Francis Freeman (Ed Skrein) and Angel Dust (Gina Carano) and later left for dead. Upon his advice from his friend Weasel (T.J. Miller) Wade Wilson adopts his new identity as masked vigilante Deadpool and swears vengeance upon Ajax and his organisation. Along the way the X-Men Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) join Deadpool in bringing down Ajax.Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool. The comical timing, everything is just perfect. The rest of the cast also support the movie well but the focus is more on the hilarious jokes and breaking of the fourth wall. Even during the opening credits Deadpool was never going to take itself seriously and it does so with style. In what could have easily just been an action-packed adventure turns out to be an adult humoured action comedy with perfectly placed comical moments throughout the movie that did not look out of place one slight bit. The soundtrack also has taken a cue from Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and has added some old gems from the past in the movie along with composer Tom Holkenborg aka Junkie XL (Max Max: Fury Road) ensuring the film is kept at an crackling, energetic pace. Director Tim Miller has done a superb job bringing Deadpool to life.There have been warnings that Deadpool is certainly not a movie for very young children and I highly concur. It is strongly recommended that parents use their discretion when letting their children watch this movie. The easily offended won't like Deadpool anyway.It's only February and Deadpool deserves to be one of the biggest movies of 2016. There's plenty of more movies to be released this year but without a doubt Deadpool deserves to be one of the biggest movies of 2016.Think of Deadpool as having your favourite dessert and you're finding yourself in a dilemma when you ask yourself it is healthy or is it bad for you? It doesn't really matter, you just can't resist it and that's what exactly what Deadpool feels like when you watch it. It's violent, foul mouthed, and lots of sex jokes but you just can't help but like it. Don't take Deadpool seriously and just sit back and have an awesome time. There's never a dull moment throughout the movie.I'm looking forward to seeing Deadpool return with a sequel but until then, I'll be re-watching this movie once it is released on Blu-ray and DVD.Stay tuned until the end of the credits for a surprise post-credits scene. Ensure you don't leave early.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Like its hero, rough around the edges but not without its charms","Like Marvel films better than some do, have never been and never will be part of this ridiculous MCU vs DCU war, and the positive critical reception drew me in to seeing 'Deadpool'.Having now seen it finally, seeing as audience reaction seemed more divisive (especially here where the dislike is unnecessarily vitriolic) which did put me off watching it for a while, it was a good film if not a great one. It was very entertaining, and credit is due for trying to take more of a comedic edge to a genre that can be taken seriously (sometimes overly so) and for taking risks. At the same, 'Deadpool' is also uneven.'Deadpool' for me did have its issues. Tonally, it is not always balanced, with too much emphasis on the humour and not enough on the action. Contrary to what others thought, most of the humour was enjoyable but there were jokes and lines that didn't land very well due to taking it too far with the crudeness and childishness (some of the superhero cliché jokes felt very out of date and stale).Other minuses are the overlong length, some repetition, a pretty forgettable villain and a rushed and muddled final act.However, 'Deadpool' is very well made visually. Slick, stylish and brooding with typically well crafted effects. The music is haunting and rousing and most of the direction is very assured and sharp, if at times not always in control of the tonal balances. The action is dynamically choreographed and exciting, and the romantic and emotional elements just about avoid the mawkish sentimentality trap and instead give 'Deadpool' its heart.Most of the humour is very funny, though its extremely black comedic nature has proven to be an acquired taste. As said, that it tried to incorporate humour into an often taken seriously genre was interesting and refreshing, even if there is a try too hard element at times with how it's balanced with everything else. The story is a pretty lightweight one structurally, but the hugely energetic pace and sense of fun elevated it.Ryan Reynolds brings charismatic charisma, vulnerability and great comic timing to the title role, one he was born to play and he successfully allows one to root for his character. All the cast do a more than serviceable job, Morena Baccarin coming over the most confidently.In summary, good film if not great. Rough around the edges but not without its charm, like the titular character hero himself. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Not my jimjam - seen it, been there, boring","I avoided this character since it's inception in the comic book world. I was done with super-hero BS movies. And this character was basically my sentiment brought into the media I stopped consuming. So this franchise was lost on me. Basically saying what I was feeling about the comic book world. But I finally decided to give it whirl after all these years. And I was not surprised by my reaction, BORING!!!. I've seen hyper-stylized ultra-violence before, it's been done so much it's like a staple now. The fact that this film is somehow the apex of some peoples film palette, just tells you the sentiment of viewers of this comic-to-film genre. If this film found you in your adolescence or found you stuck in arrested development this will definitely appeal to you. I'm happy to be in the minority on this one. I got my nephew the toys for this character. I got the t-shirts. I know who this appeals to and I could get into it if I wanted to waste my time and I probably will get through the series for the sake of my compulsive need to complete things. The problem with content like this is, once you go this far, more nuanced and in-depth content isn't going to satisfy you. ""I'm no Super-Hero"", let me thumb my nose at the very content that the viewer consumes, is the deepest cut of irony I've seen. How can you possibly watch anymore of this Comic-book garbage after loving this film so much? It's all non-sense, it's a bunch of flashing lights and tight-fitting costumes for the sake of grabbing your eyes like a fisherman uses shiny bait. Enjoy the ride while you can, I'm sure the franchise will milk you for what you're worth, and you can whine and cry when they run out of ideas just like the comic-book industry did and then came up with this idiotic character.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Contender for film of the year.,"This is perhaps the ultimate superhero movie. Its got so much rewatch-ability factor its off the scale.There is a brief scene of sex and nudity, a few swear words but nothing too serious. Its got lots of killing but even more jokes. And jokes that work on every level. If the Martian can win a comedy award, this should take every award at the next Golden Globes and Oscars by miles.There is an after-credit scene, and its worth sticking around for.From the hilarious opening credits, to the references to both X-Men and Avengers films, its perfect. Colossus is finally given some okay CGI and actual has a decent role in the story. Its nice to see his character used properly for once. The girl has her uses, but is best used to bounce jokes off, just like the villains. But its ll good.It will be hard for any film to beat this for best film of 2016.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
'Deadpool' is the world's most violent and vulgar Bugs Bunny cartoon,"If you're a fan of the ""Deadpool"" comics, I think you'll be pleased with this long-awaited film. It is the Marvel comic faithfully adapted to the big screen, just with a lot more profanity and nudity. Few superhero movies are as faithful to the original source material as Deadpool is. From the chats with the audience through the fourth wall to the cartoon character hijinks, director Tim Miller really nails it. And even if you're not a fan of the comic, this is an entertaining addition to the superhero film genre. If you combined The Mask with Watchmen,you start to get a sense of what to expect. It's a raunchy comedy mixed with a superhero movie, yet somehow the two work well together and are unlike anything we've seen on the screen before.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Pay for it to demand more of this cool s***,"When they shut him up in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", I was outraged! But that movie is what I hoped to get and more. I was laughing in the opening credits... That takes genius... and madness~I suggest that you pay to see it in IMAX, you'll see more blood in bigger details, and with the added bonus of doing a big FU to the people who denied us this juicy pleasure for years!!! Because they thought it wouldn't be profitable, so let's prove them wrong to get more. They thought that people would be too narrow minded and boring to be able to enjoy crazy originality.I know I did~ And many others too, it became an instant classic. I thought that it rated in the best movies released lately, but it was in a list of the best movies of all times!!!I just adore his WTF humor. But the vulgarity might be trying to hide a sensitive heart~ Murderers and w***** can love too, you know!!!Ryan Reynolds, thank you for fighting to have this movie come to life, and the way it should be this time.

This movie is second only to tacos...p.s. Don't take your kids...,"Yes, you read that right... Hi, I'm Review Pool, and want to give the casual Marvel enthusiast or the curious party wanting to see this movie the skinny. Here's the thing, and forgive me for being so blunt, but if you do not know this character, you will not understand this movie. You probably won't like it. It'll confuse you more than how the Kardashians are still famous. More than how the 'Real Housewives' are still a thing, and even more than how the Danish word for 'poop' (bae) became an endearing term for your boo. But I digress... Yes, this movie was created for the fans. The 4th wall breaking, wise-cracking, ultra-violent, and gratuitous dirty mind that makes up this character is completely embodied throughout this film. That being said, do not take your kids! If they are under the age of sixteen and haven't been exposed to the internet, or the characteristics previously mentioned, you will have CPS called on you. Doesn't matter how much they whine, how much they beg, do not EVER, EVER, feed them after midnight...oh wait... This movie takes a lot of elements through Deadpool's comic history, and blends them I together as best as a 1hr and 40 min movie could. Even for a fan of the character since '92, can appreciate the things that were overlooked and condensed for the sake that it graced the big screen at all. I enjoyed the elements from some of the smaller issue Deadpool comics that were thrown in there (Pizza boy scene, thank you RR, I recognized it immediately). Yes, it was raunchy. Yes, it was violent. Yes, it was full of f-bombs! But that's what makes this character so wonderful, is that it doesn't stick to the traditional do-gooder rhetoric. And fans will not be disappointed with the Stan Lee cameo...pay attention to everything in this movie, including the opening credits. And don't forget to stay through the ending credits...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Yawn at this Sausage Party,"Unique character whose sense of humor is appreciated. Those together and a fairly good story would have made this movie better than most superhero fare of late.But, the sheer number of references to DICKS dropped my rating by 4 points. Dragging out sad, tired punched-in-the balls gags, one- liners about dicks, penis, constant mention of masturbation, hand gestures, lots of un-sexy sex on repeat, and DAMN just IN YOUR FACE DICK DICK DICK. It got old quick.It just seemed obvious to me that the movie was aimed boys in the earliest stage of puberty, which is too bad because it could have had a wider appeal. That his GF worked in a strip-club (as a waitress, yeah big diff) hit the limit of my patience. It's too bad guys will get the idea they could rank such a gorgeous woman, because no woman would put up with such a juvenile personality, much less share it herself. (To those, here's a warning: no GF worth having appreciates a boy- man who still lives with his mom and plays games all day. Pure comic book fantasy - which I'm sure somebody will write one day).There was so much wrong with this whole setup. I mean, I was ready to get into this movie for the unique elements, such as the anti-hero bit, humor, experiments gone wrong, etc.Then I realized it was just a bunch of boys in a circle jerk, touching each other, then all laughing their heads off after the awkwardness subsides and they start farting. If you're not 11, it's gross to watch then just pitiful to remember.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Above-average superhero movie,"Deadpool is certainly a film worth your money. However, I would say it is an extremely overrated movie. Notable for breaking the typical superhero boundaries-especially when it comes to a Marvel product-Deadpool is a violent, obscene and gory movie, yet not in a bad way at all. I strongly disagree with it being in the top 250 (above Dances with Wolves, might I add), but a perfect movie for lovers of action, somewhat-cheap comedy and tons of pop-culture references. The humour wasn't really my thing, but certainly elicited a few chuckles and some hearty laughs, action was superbly done, plot was shaky, characters interesting and colourful. Overall, a good superhero movie but not incredible.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Ryan Reynolds is hot,Ryan Reynolds does another great job as a superhero. His first movie Green Lantern really showed how great he was as a superhero. I hope Deadpool gets to meet Ryan Reynold's Green Lantern. Ryan Reynolds should totally where the green lantern mask more.

"A ""different"" superhero movie that tries too hard to be funny","Deadpool has two things going for it, it is not a typical heroic superhero story and it is very explicit with the violence and language. So, there was some potential, but sadly it wasn't turned into a good movie.The love story is special and I actually enjoyed it, Deadpool's origin story fits with the atmosphere and overall plot, the action scenes are entertaining and the cast is alright.Everything else is pretty weak and the largest issue is the humor. The movie is supposed to be funny and even with the serious background it could have worked out... if the jokes were actually funny. But in the end it is all 4th wall breaks and childish jokes that in the best cases just dont land and in the worst cases completely interrupt the scene and ruin the mood.Another issue are all the scenes and characters that are in the movie but dont do anything. The movie is barely 100 minutes long and yet there is so much stuff in there that could be could or should have been explored more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Funny character, bad story","It wasn't a bad movie but I came in with high expectations. In the end, the funny moment cannot save a movie without a story. If by throwing in some punchlines and some CGIs, the studio can expect a big pay day, I will be very disappointed of the audience preferences. We should have better superhero movies.In addition, a superhero movie is as good as the villain in the movie, and I will have to say this one is rather pedestrian. Normally, bad people still have their reasons to do the things they do, and it needs to be sufficiently explained and exploited to tell a good story. I am not sure about the bad guys in this movie, there really isn't an epic struggle to be remembered, no matter how much CGI is in the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Film should have a maximum age limit of 10,"The film is made out of Ryan Reynolds, throwing lame jokes to the camera. In between there are bullets and knifes. No surprises. No ideas.

(Teens like to be special) Man becomes special and kills all bad guys around him. THE ENDThe jokes are not only lame, they are old.

A way better love story than Twilight,"2016 is going to be an insane year for superhero movies, yet the only one I was really interested in is this one. Seriously I am so disinterested now with the big budget superhero films with such convoluted plots, excessive and gratuitous use of CGI, awful pacing, and even being unfaithful to the comics.Speaking of unfaithful, I was so looking forward to seeing Wade Wilson in the 2009 Wolverine movie, even more when I heard Ryan Reynolds was playing him. That's perfect! Van Wilder can quip like no tomorrow so he's perfect for playing the Merc with the Mouth... sewn shut. Yea great job there Fox. And great job with Fant4stic too...Then the leaked test footage came out and all of us were like DO THAT! And the coke snorting corporates at Fox listened. From the cleverly designed marketing campaign you knew exactly the direction they were going and man did they not disappoint.This movie was so much fun. They really got the character so right because I was laughing non-stop. This was a really funny movie. Deadpool is one of the very few characters in the Marvel universe that can break the fourth wall and is self aware. And the movie really got because it is rife with meta-humour which can be seen in the very beginning with the best opening credits scene ever.And yes we see him breaking the fourth wall, making pop culture references, and slicing up bad guys. The film is not tame. The humour is nowhere near South Park levels but it does give the biggest middle finger to PC culture.The action scenes are also a lot of fun. From the sword fighting, to the shooting, to the acrobatics, they were all filmed really well. It delivers on the violence too, which is cartoonish enough but it doesn't go too much into Blade territory. Although with Wade Wilson's face, in the comics it is really boiled and deformed and here he just looks like a prune. Guess they wanted to use Ryan Reynolds as much as they could.The story is quite simple here. Its a love and revenge story. It is well paced though as it is told in a non-linear style. It somewhat slows down for me when it does get to the love story part but thankfully those scenes are mercifully short. There are some plot holes, but you really don't care because of how fun the movie is.This movie is so refreshing. I thought I was too jaded by superhero films but when you pick the right character to adapt, you can have so much fun with him or her. Honestly I really don't care about any of the upcoming Avengers films or this new X-Men film or the Superman vs Batman film because they're all so formulaic. Deadpool brought us something different and it was awesome, like a chimichanga.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Best comic book movie ever,"My most anticipated movie of the year, I went nuts for it, I had a hard time sleeping because I was too excited.So was all the excitement and marketing worth it? Yes, yes, yes, it's so great, I had so much fun, this movie will be for everyone and has you entertained from start to finish. Wait, not everyone, because it's a hard R. Seriously, anyone under the age of 17 should not by any means see this because it's very violent, has bad language, graphic nudity, drugs, has some ""love"" scenes and has a lot of overall jokes that kids won't understand.For the ones who don't know who Deadpool is, he is someone from the X-men universe which is made by the comic book company Marvel. If right now you're thinking ""so it's a superhero movie and I don't like those"" don't worry, it makes fun of superhero movies a lot.The story is about a man called Wade Wilson who is a mercenary that get's diagnosed with cancer one day. The only way he can survive is to make him a mutant so that his body can fight the cancer. So when he does become Deadpool he appears to have made an enemy that goes after his girlfriend.That's what you need to know about the movie, now everything that is awesome about this movie. First off the genre, it is everything, seriously it has aspects from every genre. It has a love story that actually makes a lot of sense so it has romance. It also is a superhero movie because it involves the X-men but it also makes fun of all the superhero movies.So it is also a satire, but not only a satire on superhero movies but also on pop-culture today and on movies in general. It's also definitely a comedy, I laughed so hard during this movie that I had issues catching my breath for laughing uncontrollably. The jokes are varying and everything in it is so funny.It also of course is an action movie because the action in it is very good and very violent and this movie definitely couldn't be done without an R-rating. It also has some horror things in it, when Wade is made into Deadpool it's actually horrifying.Then I will say that every actor portraying a character in the movie works perfectly, Ryan Reynolds is born to be Deadpool. He was exactly what the character of Deadpool should be: A kid in a man's body that breaks the 4th wall and has fun throughout the entire movie.Also his girlfriend works perfectly and their relation is totally weird but believable. The villain Ajax, played by Ed Skrein, is a very good villain and you understand why Deadpool wants to get him. And in my personal opinion, this is by far the best portrayal of Colossus in a movie to date. Then we have TJ Miller as the best friend of Wade who is hilarious and even the taxi-driver Dopinder who they also managed to make funny.I have one single issue with the movie and that's that it is too short. The movie was so brilliantly put together that when they got to the 3rd act of the movie I thought: ""it's almost over but I don't want it to"". Luckily there has already been an announcement for a sequel, so I'm happy. Also if you haven't seen it yet, stay in the theater to the end of the credits because there is a great end-credit scene.Deadpool is the most entertaining experience in a movie theater I had in a very long time and it's a brilliant movie, go see it if you haven't already. Definitely a 10/10 which is my 10th actual 10/10 I ever gave.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
My first and most likely my last review but this film deserves the honor,"Now I knew I wanted to see this film. Not because I am one of those fanatic, over the top, comic hording maniacs. But just because I am a sucker for the easy to watch super hero movies. My expectations did not exceed the ones I had prior to all of the xmen films or any other film of the same genre for that matter.This last week I had some trouble reaching my goals at work, so to reset my good mood, I asked a friend to go see this film. Without thoroughly reading reviews, I quickly scanned some headlines that already had been written about Deadpool. I seemed promising!I can ensure you with near to definite certainty, this will be my first and my last review. But this film deserves every misspelled, every typo and every sentence which in English does not fully cover that what I am trying to express to you on how much I liked this Film.Deadpool does not have loose ends, does not have moments which leave you wondering afterwards about how do they not make sense. Some people may find the abundance of humour confusing in a superhero movie, but hey, how would you be if nothing could kill you?I enjoyed every joke, every one liner, every reference to other movies. The entire audience in the cinema couldn't stop laughing. And for your information, the Dutch are the hardest audience to entertain.Now the only thing I am not sure off is that female viewers may go home with severe lack of self esteem due to the overload of extreme good looking women (and the occasional nudity.....skip that....loads of T&A)I am also worried about milking Deadpool. The sequel will never be able to top the first. So unless the studio is confident they are able to make something better, my advice would be; please don't bother. Let this one become an icon. This film raised the bar and set the standard for films to come in this genre.If I was asked to say something about this film in one sentence than it would be this; Too much of anything is never a good thing, until deadpool was made...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Don't Let the Fanboys Get to You,"I remember stumbling into my father's office one day as he was editing footage of a thirteen- year-old boy's Bar Mitzvah. He was trying to figure out what to do with this horrible chunk of film wherein the boy and his friends were passing around a microphone, shouting any and every moronic, inane thing their brains could come up with. I recently rewatched bits of that footage under a new name: Deadpool.Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), former Special Forces operative turned gun-for-hire, finds the love of his life, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). They understand each other, they have great fun and great sex together, and Wade is the happiest he's ever been. That is, until he inexplicably develops late-stage cancer throughout his body, and randomly leaves his girlfriend in the middle of the night to participate in some super secret experimental procedure that will cure him. The procedure turns him into an ugly freak, but grants him extraordinary healing powers, prompting Wade to seek revenge on the man who changed him, and win back his girl.The biggest problem Deadpool has is Deadpool himself. For some reason, people seem to mistake his rampant profanity and poorly cultivated sexual humor as comedy, because it comes from the mouth of a comic book protagonist. I thought we had matured from beyond that point. I thought that Watchmen, a product of the 80s, proved that we could expect more from our superheroes. Why people choose to settle for comedy that was stale when we were middle schoolers, I don't know, but I think it bears mentioning that Deadpool doesn't tell jokes. He just curses and makes half polished ""that's what she said"" quips. His breaking the fourth wall shatters any sense of immersion a viewer might have experienced, and while Godard gets a pass on such antics because he's not directing story-driven action films, Tim Miller gets no such pass. Similarly, Deadpool's discussing the actors who play other X-Men characters is beyond frustrating. I want to grab the scriptwriters and scream at them. What kind of universe is this where Ryan Reynolds references himself, but doesn't acknowledge that he, himself, is currently playing Wade Wilson? I hear the argument all the time that all of this is satire. Deadpool comics exist to lampoon preexisting tropes and archetypes, but satire requires a point of view, which Deadpool ultimately lacks. In actuality, the film succumbs to the same trite stereotypes it pretends to transcend.All that aside, there is still a considerable amount in this movie to like. Most notably, Wade and Vanessa's love story, prior to the ill conceived revenge plot. Reynolds plays Wade with charisma and energy, and Baccarin reciprocates in turn. Their characters are engagingly quirky, and some of the most well crafted and cinematic jokes come during these scenes. One scene in particular, which takes place in an arcade, stands out as my favorite sequence in the entire movie.Unfortunately, when your movie is called Deadpool, and Deadpool is nothing more than an obnoxious man-child who leans so heavily on the crutch of generic, crass, uninspired R-rated humor, it's hard to look too fondly upon the film as a whole. Don't succumb to the fanboy hype. Realize Deadpool for the manipulative, immature rehash it is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A superhero movie that is at its best when it's not taking itself too seriously.,"Deadpool wasn't supposed to be made, but I am glad it was. As with the comic book character, Deadpool is at his best because of his self-deprecating humor and his fourth-wall-breaking style. Ryan Reynolds inhabits the character with aplomb, making good use of his well-honed comic timing and a genuinely funny script to deliver a character so funny, irreverent and relentless, you begin to wonder why it almost wasn't made into a movie, and why studios weren't that much into it in the first place.No one knows who actually leaked the test footage that kicked all of this off, but thank goodness it happened.What a ride! Here's waiting for the next one!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Wow. Disappointing,"Deadpool is a slightly better than average superhero movie, but that's it.It has a lot of weaknesses. Here are some of them:1. If you've seen the trailers, you've seen the movie.2. The storyline is bog standard. The writers/director try to mix it up through an unusually (and unnecessarily) complex flashback structure that feels like a failed magic trick.3. All the characters are underdeveloped (including Wade Wilson). Whilst there seem to be a lot of scenes dealing with character development, we are nonetheless left with very superficial, simplistic and clichéd motivations.4. It's got tons of jokes but only a few are actually funny (at the chuckle level only)5. It's filled with violent action but none of it is particularly creative (see a Tarantino film) nor does the violence carry any real emotional impact (see Tarantino, Netflix Daredevil & Jessica Jones, or even Kick-Ass)6. It's got plenty of nudity (and a little sex) but it feels gratuitous7. It breaks the fourth wall but it's for no reason. The way it breaks it doesn't actually draw us into the movie, nor does it give us a deeper understanding of Deadpool himself. At best, it's used as just another chuckle level joke. At worst it takes the place of the laziest expositional voice-over.8. Limited sets and settings make the movie feel a bit cheap. You can see where the bulk of the limited (?? - $60 million) budget was spent (initial freeway fight) and where they cut corners (just about everywhere else)On the plus side;1. Whilst the story is standard, it's paced well. The action, jokes, swearing,nudity, etc. are all seamlessly orchestrated. It never feels flat (until you leave the theater).2. Ryan Reynolds does a great job carrying the energy and the pace of the movie. His acting is fine, but it's his enthusiasm and alignment with this version of Deadpool that is the foundation of the picture.3. The opening action sequence is excellent, well envisaged and choreographed. The film starts with a bang and the energy of that bang carries you through most of the film.I'm not familiar with the comic book version of Deadpool but, based on what I've read leading up to the release of the film, he does sound like a cool character. He does feel as though he could form the basis for a smart, self-aware, complex and edgy superhero movie. Unfortunately, this is not that film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Awesome Movie!!,"I never knew of the character Deadpool until the X-Men movies. I was skeptical about seeing the movie. Now that I have watched the movie, I am waiting for the sequel. The movie was definitely made for adults and I found myself thinking....the character is actually doing what we secretly wanted super hero's to do to the bad guys all along. Just like the movie ""The Punisher Warzone""...""Speak softly and carry a big stick"". There was a perfect blend of CGI and the chemistry between the actors. The one liners between the characters provided a perfect combination of comedy and action. Stan Lee,s cameo was the icing on the cake. The re-watch value for this movie is high, when the DVD is released, it will be in my collection.... I can only imagine the deleted scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

as far as comic book movies go.. perfection!,"Back in 2008 (or 2009, who cares?) We got our first glimpse of Deadpool on the big screen. What we got took away everything decent about the character, he is the merc with the mouth, yet his mouth was sewn together! Ryan Reynolds seemed perfect for the role, how did it all go so wrong? Well now, in 2016 Reynolds returns and we get our first official Deadpool movie. In that we get the world's greatest apology for one of the most abysmal films in the superhero genre, and a highly original film that does 100% justice to one of the most lovable douchebags of all time!So, here we follow Wade Wilson, a former mercenary who is diagnosed with terminal cancer. He undergoes an experimental procedure and is transformed into Deadpool, a badass loudmouth with the ability to heal. One problem remains, he is now ugly as sin. We follow Deadpool on a revenge story, as well as a love story of sorts that really raises the bar for future comic book movies. What i absolutely love about this film is that the whole origin is told through flashbacks looking over Wade's life. Deadpool is a character who is well known for breaking the fourth wall and the way that is addressed in this film is both hilarious and amazingly true to it's source. It is also easily one of the funniest films for a very long time. The opening titles had me laughing out loud alone and if they don't peak your interest right away then I'm afraid you're in the wrong film! I love self aware jokes like that and there are a fair few of them scattered around.The supporting cast do amazingly well as well. Colossus and Negasonic TeenageWarhead from the Xmen are just the greatest additions to this film. This is easily the best incarnation of Colossus we have ever seen and with such a low budget he looked beautiful. Of course, with them on board there are some very funny Xmen jokes to look out for. Morenna Baccarin (did i spell that right?) Is the perfect love interest for Ryan Reynolds. Her character is a lot better than other 2-Dimensional females in comic book films. When she is introduced and the way that happens shows how much of an impact she makes and it is great. As for villains, Ed Skerin was so unlikeable, which is great because with a character like Deadpool it is important to hate our main villain and the inclusion of Angel Dust was also a good decision. And lastly, TJ Miller acts almost as Wade's second in command, Weasel. He stole quite a few scenes, but in the end this is Ryan Reynold's show and nobody tries to take that from him.So do i recommend? Hell yeah i do! Its the perfect comic book film for the fact it really sticks to it's awesome source material and i could not imagine a better film for Deadpool. Stick around for after the credits because we get a great little surprise. Definitely not for the faint of heart because as well as being very violent in an over the top way, there are also some pretty dark and shocking scenes that can even be a little hard to watch, but they don't last long. Anyway, go and support Deadpool because we need more superhero films like this. Now i have the sudden urge to listen to 80's music and eat chimi changas...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Deadpool. A new class of superhero!,"From the studio that inexplicably sewed his *beep* mouth shut the first time, comes Deadpool. Yeah Deadpool, that sounds like a *beep* franchise. Absolutely amazing movie by Marvel. Now I can say that I forgive Marvel for messing Avengers 2. Deadpool is the first ""R- Rated"" movie that I have ever seen in cinema and I enjoyed every second of it, thanks to the censor board that they didn't ban it in our country otherwise my weekend would've been ruined if I hadn't got to watch Deadpool. Deadpool is not a typical superhero movie, so even if you don't like to watch superhero movies, you will love Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds was a perfect choice for Deadpool who did a fantastic job in his role and the script was very original, funny and well written. It has multiple elements including action, comedy, romance and most of all emotions. Moreover, this is not just a superhero movie, this is a love story that's why it's being released on Valentine's day. So, go on see it, enjoy it and have a laugh later. Especially for single people who do not have any date on V's day, Deadpool is the best gift that they will ever get *haha*. No doubt it is and will be one of the best movies ever produced by Marvel along with The Avengers. I'd recommend this movie for everyone who is allowed to watch it in their jurisdiction. Have a great weekend!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Keep making movies like Deadpool,"We really enjoyed this one. Great writing, lots of action, excellent comic timing, blowed lots of stuff up real good... Keep this team together and make more I say. RE Ryan Reynolds, I never took him seriously before, and maybe it's because this happens to be the perfect wisecracking witty role to finally showcase properly, so now we have one good memory to erase the sadness of Blade Trinity, RIPD etc. RE writers Rheese and Wernick who also wrote Zombieland screenplay - I really think you have a good team there - keep doing what you're doing, don't let egos, a Yoko or agent split you up. Director Tim Miller comes from an animation background and applies an animator's sense of motion that really added to the pacing and style. Some may say there's too much gratuitous violence and nakedness but, they may be getting used to the sanitized family content of most comic book films. As long as this gets put into the adult category with Tarentino and Frank Miller (Sin City), the rest of us will have a place to party away from the Harper Valley PTA.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Dead pool,"Deadpool was everything as ADVERTISED and so much more. This is a superhero movie for adults. It was in the comics and even more so in the movies. To those who are so pent up over the idea that a movie would have sex, jokes, break the fourth wall, grotesque violence, and so much more, please get over yourself.To begin with, I have four kids, two younger than 18. When the previews came out I did a littler research. Not for kids. So I didn't take mine. I knew what I was getting into. Sex, violence, jokes, jokes about sex and violence. I am 38 with a master's degree and teach at the high school level. And the movie was great. I laughed until I cried and ended up coughing because I was laughing so hard.To those who were offended by this movie. You obviously have a a certain set of standards for movies that you think ALL movies should have. You knew what you were getting into. It had an R rating. It was very evident what would be in the movie. To trash the movie because it did not fit into your world view that all superhero movies should be exactly like X-Men or Batman. Please get over yourself. Sometimes people want to see something nasty and over the top and get a good laugh. Mission accomplished. See this if you want the low hanging fruit.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A good start with room  to improve,"Marvel has earned the right to take some chances when it comes to it's cinematic universe, and while Deadpool does not fall into that just being able to put a marvel logo in front of your movie goes a long way. Deadpool is more related to the X-Men universe, a universe that seems less fit for the merc with a mouth but none the less it is where his story resides. Deadpool brings some adult comic relief to comic book movies that is not necessarily the first of its kind, but definitely the first to take it this far.First the good things, right off the bat I will mention that this movie has earned its R rating which for a Deadpool movie is almost necessarily a must. This was the right choice for so many reasons namely the violence and the dirty words laden through this movie. It's nice to see what may actually happen to an unlucky civilian if they were toy get into the crossfire with one of these superheros. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for this role and we all knew it since X-Men Origins. His comedic style fits the role perfectly and it's always nice when an actor really throws himself fully behind a character the way Reynolds has done here. The story is surprisingly well paces mixing back story with action sequences in a creative way. Unlike most if not all other comic book movies the humor in Deadpool has no cheese ball factor. Not every joke is a home run but most of it fits the characters. Another problem comic book movies have is too much back story/personal stories interfering with the main plot of the story. They may add some light to these characters but ultimately bog down these movies. Deadpool pays its service and gives him a reason to go on his quest, without spending more time than needed.I do have some problems with the movie, none of which ruin the movie, but if some were not there it would have been a much better movie. While Ryan Reynolds is perfect in his role, I thought he was almost underutilized. The character was without a doubt written with him in mind, but I think the writers tried too hard to make the Deadpool fit Ryan Reynolds rather than letting him fit into Deadpool. The movie also sort of teases us at the beginning. The opening is so different than anything in any comic book movie to date and gives hope that not only will the comic book movie genre get lampooned a bit, but also that Deadpool will be different than all of these movies. As the movie goes on though that seems to fall away and we almost get left with a basic comic book movie plot in the end. This genre has been so flooded in the last few years, it can feel like I am watching the same story unfold over and over again and I had hopes that Deadpool would avoid this structure.Overall Deadpool is a great deal of fun for anyone who is a fan of the genre but has been getting bored with the same 7 characters being re booted and re made. Deadpool took some of what Guardians of the Galaxy had going for it, new characters, solid well thought out comedy and a sheer passion to make the movie happen. You can tell that even while there seems to have been some slight interference from the studio, Deadpool seems to be almost a passion project for some people involved and that always shows through. A truly enjoyable movie for any comic book fan of legal age that is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Irreverent, hilarious and ballsy. Just awesome.","Kick-starting 2016's superhero season with a bang, this adults-only comic book adaptation is ballsy, irreverent and hilariously cheeky. Think a Kick-Ass flavoured X-men movie, but even filthier. Wisely opting to forgo the typical U.S. PG-13 rating the vast majority of blockbusters aim for (in order to widen their audience reach), Deadpool doubles down on its brain-splattering violence, vulgar jokes and disgusting potty mouth, all to great effect. There's also the unique tone to separate it from other comic-book flicks; not only is it subversive and amusingly juvenile, but it whole heartedly embraces its fourth-wall-breaking and meta humour roots. Wolverine and Hugh Jackman: beware. Screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick earn praise for more than just the snappy dialogue and pitch-perfect gags though, for they have crafted a franchise starter that evades the usual origin story pitfalls by messing with timelines and genre tropes. Working with a relatively low budget of $58m, debutant director Tim Miller puts every dollar to work to ensure the action sequences are inventive, exhilarating and high calibre, augmented with CGI as good as anything you'll see in the MCU or DCCU. None of this would be possible, however, if it wasn't for Ryan Reynolds. Having pushed for this film incessantly over the last seven years, Reynolds finally gets his wish to properly portray the smart-alec character he was born to play. After the debacle that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine – where his Merc with the Mouth was idiotically sidelined and silenced – Reynolds relishes the opportunity to finally give the titular antihero, and alter-ego Wade Wilson, the spotlight he deserves. The support is top notch too: Morena Baccarin is game for anything as Wilson's tough-as-nails fiancé, T.J. Miller gives good comedy relief, and Ed Skrein and Gina Carano are suitably nasty as the merciless villains. Holding absolutely nothing back, Deadpool is a rip-roaring movie that will have you squirming, cheering and laughing possibly all at once.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"A comedy, that's actually funny","This movie surprised me. I walked into this movie hoping for it to be good; and man am I glad to have gone. This movie was brutal, crude, indecent, and a hell of a good time. The casting for this movie was nothing less than absolute perfection, Ryan Reynolds shines with his secondary characters T.J. Miller (Weasel), Brianne Hildebrand (Negasonic Teenage Warhead), and Stefan Kapicic (Colossus) providing great performances that really worked with Deadpool's character. I was taken aback, I knew I would laugh at some jokes, but not THAT many jokes. This movie, although following a by-the-book plot line, covered up the story with it's action and comedy and made it feel brand new. This movie may not have reinvented the superhero genre, but it surely provides a fun and refreshing good time while it lasts.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Ryan Reynolds brought a comic accurate Deadpool and the film is a masterpiece in the superhero genre,"It took a long time for 20th Century Fox to have Deadpool appear in their X-Men Universe, the character's first appearance in love action was in X-Men Origins: Wolverine and it wasn't the Deadpool many fans wanted. But the beloved anti-hero, Deadpool is back and stays true to his comic book counterpart. Huge thanks to Simon Kinberg, Ryan Reynolds and Lauren Shuler Donner who served as producers for the movie, and what they have given us is something incredible... Something amazing and memorable for years to come, it have grown to be one of my favorite action/comedy movies of all time. The adult humor is wonderful, it's funny and at times really raunchy but it works, it's Deadpool after all.Deadpool is directed by Tim Miller from a screenplay by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. It was his directional debut and he did an excellent job, I don't really have anything negative to say but it isn't anything mind blowing. The writing for the dialogue, jokes and characters are great. The plot isn't very original but it works fine, you will be entertained from start to finish and they succeeded with that.
It stars Ryan Reynolds in the title role alongside Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T. J. Miller, Gina Carano, and Brianna Hildebrand. Everyone did a great job with both the action sequences and the dramatic parts, but Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson / Deadpool is breathtaking because he is Deadpool, no one could do it better than him. It's his passion project and you see how passionate he is in the performance, good job Ryan.For a superhero movie, the film received many awards and nominations, including two Critics' Choice Awards and two Golden Globe nominations. It shows how good the movie is and I would say it is a masterpiece in its genre. They got so many things right and almost none wrong, the choice of music is on point and so was the jokes that were told, the improvisation.
I've watched Deadpool three times now and I will continue that route, re-watching it an endless amount of times. I like it a lot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Marvel film like no other. An astounding achievement in humor and action!!,"They said it couldn't be done. They said ""Deadpool"" will never be made and I, as well as others, almost agreed. After his abysmal performance in X-crement Origins: Wimperine, the potential of The Merc With A Mouth, was almost terminated without fanfare. Good ol Wade Wilson just couldn't get a break.Well, after so many trials and tribulations, Deadpool was finally given the green light and lo and behold, he bursts out of the comics and onto the silver screen with spectacular results so vulgar, so violent, so crude, yet so refreshingly simple, that it set the bar for R-rated comic book movies; quite possible for years to come. This film proved that violent superheroes...actually...make that anti-heroes can be immensely profitable; judging be the film's juggernaut box-office success. As an origin story, Deadpool is great, showing us a side to the Merc With A Mouth with a violent, vulgar side to the character, but also surprisingly, with human depth; something Origins failed to achieve. Character development and human pathos combine to make a troubled and flawed jerk with a heart of gold, a very likable and relate-table jerk with a heart of gold.Yes, the action is bloody, yet great with slo-mo effects and yes the humor is vulgar and narcissistic, but it fits the character very well. But most importantly, is the acting and Ryan Reynolds NAILS it perfectly. I can think of no other actor that is much suited for the role and he is simply perfect; with his manic personality and spot on wisecracks. The film simply wouldn't work without a hard R rating. Thankfully, the studio let the filmmakers run wild in high octane adventure and explosive gravitas.Props to all involved in Deadpool. It's smart, stylish, and refreshingly original. I'm glad they had the balls to make a R-rated Marvel comic book movie and they achieved it. One of the best films of the year and I can't wait for the inevitable sequel. A second and third viewing is definitely not out of the question. Great film, great cast, great direction. Simply put. Great R-rated comic book movie!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"The sequels are much better, but it's still entertaining","First up, I really don't know why people love this one so much. Both Deadpool 2 and Deadpool and Wolverine are infinitely better than Deadpool 1 for me. Better stories, better action and better comedy.As for the movie itself. Yeah, it's pretty decent. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool is genius casting but he definitely improves in the sequels.Plot is pretty basic, kind of a generic superhero origin story. I actually found Vanessa to be pretty annoying in this one but I know most people wouldn't agree. Some hardcore NSFW scenes that aren't present in the sequels for whatever reason. Action is fine but compared to the sequels it's not great. The antagonist (Francis) is very forgettable and mostly works as a plot device to give the protagonist motivations to do something.As for the jokes, there are a couple of really good ones but I found most to just go over my head in this one. It may just be a me thing though. And other jokes were clearly supposed to be really funny but I barely grinned. And I hate every single sexual joke here, please make them stop. As mentioned before, they improve drastically in Deadpool 2 and Deadpool and WolverineI recommend it, but please do watch the sequels after it since they are the real good ones in my opinionScore: 6/10 (Decent)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One of the funniest films that I have seen,"Deadpool is an amazing clash of a comedy and superhero origin story which clashes incredibly funny. If you are under 15 then I do think you shall wait because of the violence, sex language and even more violence. In my case it was these factors that made me love this film. For my case in watching this film I did find it a tiny bit underwhelming but it didn't strafe to far from my expectations.There wasn't anything bad actually in the movie its just that some of the jokes did feel a bit underwhelming. The fight sequences where good and probably the best part of the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Definitely different but hardly better,"This has been among the most hyped movies to have hit the screen recently. The trailers and commercials were very indicative of a hilariously rendered action flick. And for the most part, it delivers. It's different, wacky and cheeky, in that it is very conscious of itself as a superhero movie, and it exercises this to the fullest. The story and villain however, are disappointingly mundane.The central performance by Ryan Reynolds is perfect; he effortlessly captures the essence of Deadpool, portraying him with the requisite quirk and gleeful abandon. The music is another entertaining aspect of the movie and complements the adjoining scenes wonderfully. The movie is funny right at the get-go, the opening credits was definitely the funniest and most innovative introduction to a movie, and is sure to have everyone in splits.The beginning of this movie is about the only time it's able to be consistently funny, starting with the opening credits and the car chase/shooting sequence. Post the first 20 minutes however, things take a turn for a worse in these poor transitions to Deadpool's past which act as a sudden mellow to the intensity of the opening action scene. We're then subjected to the quintessential romance that I felt was largely unsatisfying, for as much as Deadpool The Movie detests conformism and cliché, it was unable to do anything new with its half baked romance in the entirety of its runtime. The story hardly progresses in the first half, because it only orchestrates a lot of catching up on the part of the viewer. The origin story was already quite clear from the amazing trailers, and so it oddly felt like a retread. Also, the trailers featured almost all the funniest lines in the movie, so there impact in the movie itself was alarmingly shallow, what with the absence of any MORE funny scenes with the exception of a couple in the latter half of the film.The action too was quite standard, with no real off the chart sequences, barring possibly the initial scene. The story, as I already stated, was conventional comic book-esque fare. In the second half, the film picks up, since it focuses on the present and does not waste anymore time on the ramblings of the past. The humour once again finds its place and the action hits the crescendo, all to once again collapse to a lacklustre climax. The villain, lest I forget, seemed more akin to being the second-in-command to a villain, and was hardly menacing.One last aspect I'd like to dwell upon is the character development. It's safe to say that this movie has very little to no character development at all. There is also little to no back story for the two funny, but disappointingly inconsequential X-Men in the film. Deadpool's love interest too, is hardly explored.So all in all, this movie has a great wise-cracking comedian in Deadpool, for I wouldn't call him a hero. There are a plethora of ingeniously funny scenes, betrayed ONLY by there revelation in the trailers themselves. The story is dull and generic, something that the movie claims so hard to detest. The villain and the romance are half baked.So that's what this is, a comedy with action to complement. If you're looking for plot, character development arcs, ""romance"", or even an immediacy or urgency of knowing something is at stake, that you're familiar with in other comic book movies, you'll find yourself disappointed. It's apparent that it is receiving a lot of love from viewers which most likely is driven by the insane amount of hype created by the trailers to the movie. For if we were to keep the laugh riot aside, it would be quite apparent that its current rating of 8.7 on IMDb, is exaggerated. Go in with lower expectations and you'll definitely be entertained, if nothing else.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A simple summary (without the spoilers); what you need to know,"We live in a time where super hero movies are all the rage. Who doesn't love a good super hero throw down, cool origin stories, and awesome villains? While decent hero flicks are easy enough to find, occasionally a masterpiece, like ""The Dark Knight"", will come along and in the process wow the critics and audiences alike.And then we get Deadpool. Where to start with this one? To give it some comparison, it makes ""Batman and Robin"" look like an Academy Award-winner by comparison. How is that? Quite simply put, the movie is terrible in every sense of the word.Deadpool is untrue to its source material and to the very character himself. The character is known for his violence and humor throughout his comic book, TV show, and video game appearances. The filmmakers, in their apparent efforts to make the character more ""edgy"" and appeal more to adults, have stripped him of this, instead replacing the comedy and fun with crude dialogue, sex, sex, more sex, and more foul words than possibly all of Eminem and Lil Wayne's albums combined, and all of this without any of the substance that have made Wade Wilson's adventures and misadventures alike over the years so memorable, exciting, and laugh-out-loud funny.No wit, and no soul. It insults the intelligence of its audience, and then expects them to pay. We've come a long way in terms of the quality of super hero films; to call this a step back could potentially be the biggest understatement of the year.For those who have been waiting for a good Deadpool film, this unfortunately is not it. Perhaps the best on-screen appearance to- date can be found in the animated short ""Hulk v.s. Wolverine"", but for the time being we're still going to have to wait for our favorite ""Merc with the Mouth"" to get the big-screen sensation that he deserves.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Ryan Reynolds did to Deadpool what peanut butter did to jelly. Yeah!! That good! The movie is made for the fans the comic book, but more importantly its made with one thing in mind. Don't hold any punches, literally & figuratively. Now you may not get all the comic book jokes or puns, but you will get satisfied with not only the humor, but great action and effects. I have waited along time for one of the X-Men movies to do my boy Colossus justice, whoever thought it would be in Deadpool. Date movie, sure (if she likes that kinda of thing), family movie/kids movie... not so much. Deadpool will make waves in this industry with it being a lower budget comic book movie that was a hit in my eyes.

Hi Teacher,"A new word should be added to the Oxford dictionary: Deadpool-a combination of humour,action and romance (and I feel like I'm missing something). 
Deadpool, the 2016 Tim Miller movie that got fans to both Anti-hero concept and Ryan Reynolds. Some may say it was all about the advertisement but the movie actually was amazing (even though you won't get any morals from it other that staying away from strangers with suits).The beginning was unpredictable : unlike typical superhero movies where they start from the child sad story.Reverse chronology was used in Deadpool by getting straight to the fight leaving the audience confused before the story gets more clear. The asides in my opinion were the best part maybe just because we dont them that often in movies if not at all .My most recommended superhero movie is surely Deadpool (not for kids of course).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Some good wall-breaking,"This whole movie tried wall-breaking since it's the main point of the character. And it actually made laughs sincerely for us. But with that also had some bland moments. Really, just the whole aesthetic of it.It was also clever to not have this be the highest budgeted movie ever. It paved way to have gigs on this broke dude making fun of how much these heroes are and studio deals that has to go through.But with that, the origin story pushed the movie back. We could've had more Deadpool time. This is the troubling concern.The movie had too many themes as the origin story continued. It tried to have a cool revenge story and then filled the movie with a bunch of blocks about Deadpool's little past bits as himself b.d. (before Deadpool). Still, this didn't give much weight to Wade Wilson, as he kept on doin funny jokes and 4th wall-breaking to fit his superhero persona.So yeah, gigs and revenge (maybe love story too).

*The Merc with a Mouth Breaks the Mold*,"First of all i want to say, i didn't watch Deadpool 1 and 2 until today. I watched both films because Wolverine is in Films 3rd instalment. I watched both movies in one day and i must ask myself why didn't i watched these films before?Deadpool is a revolutionary superhero film that shattered expectations and redefined the genre. It's a raucous, irreverent, and often downright vulgar comedy wrapped in a superhero action movie.Deadpool was a game-changer for the superhero genre. It proved that R-rated, irreverent films could be both critically acclaimed and commercially successful. By embracing its adult audience, the film pushed boundaries and challenged the conventions of the superhero genre.The film's success paved the way for other studios to experiment with darker, more mature superhero films. It also demonstrated the power of character-driven storytelling, proving that humor and heart could coexist with violence and action.One of the film's greatest strengths is its character development, despite its over-the-top humor. Deadpool's vulnerability is hinted at beneath his brash exterior, creating a complex and relatable character. The film explores themes of loss, redemption, and the search for love, adding depth to the otherwise outrageous protagonist.Ryan Reynolds is the perfect embodiment of the titular character, bringing a manic energy and razor-sharp wit to the role. The film's humor is a masterclass in comedic timing. His fourth-wall-breaking antics and constant stream of pop culture references are both hilarious and refreshing. The film's ability to balance humor with heartfelt moments is a testament to its skillful writing. The film doesn't shy away from violence or profanity, creating a unique and edgy tone.While the plot is relatively straightforward, it serves as a solid backbone for the film's real strengths: the character comedy and action sequences. The fight scenes are brutal and entertaining, with a healthy dose of self-awareness. The supporting cast, including Morena Baccarin and T. J. Miller, provide solid comedic relief.Deadpool is a film that knows its audience and delivers exactly what they want. It's a celebration of comic book absurdity, wrapped in a surprisingly heartfelt story about redemption and love.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Bad-ass action film with humor and bloody action i have ever seen,"Deadpool is a damn good bad-ass action film in the MARVEL comic book section movies I have seen. The film is rated R with blood squibs, filed with explosive action, I love this film from end till end, it is one of my favorites. It has jokes and humor I was laughing, the same time I enjoyed a bloody action sequences. In the opening scene you have a bad-ass action sequences in which Deadpool jumps in too van beating thugs. On a bridge is fantastic sequence in which Deadpool has only 12 shots in his IWI Desert Eagle Mark XIX gun and he kills bad guys one by one while mercenaries are firing at him with machine guns.The best thing is the Ajax's motorcycle mercenaries use the Heckler & Koch MP5K against Deadpool firing thousand rounds on him dodging Deadpool's gun firing bullets at the motorcyclist. Maximum Effort is a bad-ass theme for Deadpool that is why I enjoy the film so much for the action and humor. Ryan Ryanolds know how too make a good movie. Deadpool bullet countdown scene awesome in which he counts bullets before he kills bad-guys he shots with one bullet a mercenary in the grenade causing explosion bad-ass. This is a bad-ass action film but it is also an origin story about Wade Wilson how he become Deadpool.The movie isn't about superhero who has a nice life or is rich or billionaire no Slade Wilson is poor he has a hard life. He has to earn his money with hard work. He is an ex special forces operative now a criminal as an mercenary helping youth people like he save a young girl from a stalker a real stalker yes he was mean he still saved a young girl of course he was paid. He meet his girlfriend who is a prostitute and he lives normal life until he finds out he has cancer because he doesn't want to die he accepts invention for faculty for experimental treatment for his cancer. He is taken to Ajax and Angel Dust, who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes. They torture him until the faculty prison doesn't explode caused by Wilson while Ajax stabbed him with an iron stick Wade Wilson survives and promise revenge on Francis Freeman / Ajax (Ed Skrein) Honestly one of the best rated R action films I have seen.I absolutely love Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson / Deadpool he Is a bad-ass in this movie not only he jokes but he acts really believable. Love his character I love the action sequences. Gina Carano is in this movie and she is a bad-ass the fight sequence between her and Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) is excellent in the movie. Stefan Kapicic who provides the voice for Colossus is excellent right from the comic book his character. Brianna Hildebrand is Negasonic Teenage Warhead she is likable her character is a good superhero Character. Ed Skrein as Francis Freeman / Ajax is a great psychopath villain who tortures innocent people with his experiments until Deadpool stops him. Morena Baccarin as Vanessa as a good love interest of Wade Wilson.I love the ending sequence in which Deadpool recruits Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead to help him fight against Francis Freeman / Ajax and Angel Dust that is a bad-as action ever, love the rescue mission on Vanessa.Tim Miller directed perfectly this movie that I had blast watching it. The action sequences in this movie are completely insane that is why it is so good film. I would gave this movie a 10 but the song Chicago You're The Inspiration by Berracelik in which Vanessa lies and you see some animated animals and that song plays that scene ruined the movie for me, sounds from ""The Karate Kid Part II"" The Glory of Love - Peter Cetera that is why I hate that song in this movie, that is why I gave a 9 which is a good score. The soundtracks could have been better in this movie, there Is neither one soundtrack that I like in here. The rest of the film I enjoy and I love it. It is fast paced and goes quickly around.Just too let you know this isn't the greatest film of all time, the best one, but it is a damn good action film I recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Now Deadpool is my favourite superhero,"I had never seen or heard about Deadpool before the movie was announced. I later got to know there was a game on this too, but I thought it must be just any regular superhero game like the non-Rocksteady, non-Insomniac ones. When I read the reviews of the movie that said it's outrageously hilarious, I thought it's because American humour is very bad so even mediocre jokes are funny to them. Also it was 2016 so ""abusing funny"" was something on a rise (AIB, TVF, BB Ki Vines, CarryMinati etc). Thus I completely ignored this movie. As such I wasn't into superhero stuff so I wasn't even gonna notice it anyway. Then one day we were going on a trip so I saw this movie in a flight. And now I simply love it.Deadpool was the first X-Men movie I ever watched from beginning to end. I didn't even know anything about the X-Men franchise. And it's a good thing this movie barely borrows anything from its predecessor. There are only easter eggs spread here and there. It's all clarified by Deadpool himself when he asks Colossus where everyone is at Xavier's School. Colossus says they are all out on a vacation, to which Deadpool replies it's a lie, and that they are not here because this is a low budget movie. By just mentioning that dialogue it makes it very clear what kind of a sense of humour this movie has.Deadpool continuously breaks the fourth wall. He talks to the audience, mentions that this is just a movie, references Ryan Reynolds' previous movies like Green Lantern (please don't make my costume green, or animated!) and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. He even roasts himself in a scene after his face gets disfigured, where he says that only good looking people have a chance in this world, for example Ryan Reynolds is famous only because of his good looks and not because of his acting. There's also a scene where he breaks a fourth wall and gives a flashback and then breaks the fourth wall in that also, so he says he broke the sixteenth wall.The sense of humour of every character is intense. Dopindar kidnaps his cousin Bandhu so that he can marry Gita, which he had done on Deadpool's suggestion. The scene where Deadpool forgets his weapons in Dopindar's car almost made me fall from my seat laughing. There was also Colossus who was a stooge the whole time, and Negasonic who mostly completed the jokes. Same goes for Ajax and Vanessa also.The action scenes are also very well choreographed. For some reason it's so much fun to see Deadpool fight. It was easily better than any superhero action that has been shown in any X-Men movie (other than the Quicksilver ones). In the beginning it was so funny when he shows the drawing of Francis to everyone and asks them if they have seen him. I really liked that part where he had numbered all his bullets and shoots one guy who runs out of bullets.The story is also very good. The way of narrating it is something only suitable for a Deadpool movie. It gives the complete origin story of Deadpool and also fills in with comic relief over the otherwise grim story. There is also a heavy amount of character development, as Wade Wilson goes from being a carefree guy to having to leave Vanessa after he got cancer, and then trying to get back to her but thinking she will be horrified to see him, and then finally accepting who he is.Personally Deadpool is one of my favourite superhero movies. It was my favourite back when I saw it, but now things are different because, you know, I saw the sequel. I'd surely recommend anyone to watch it even if they know nothing about the X-Men movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Too forced,"Production is great, but almost all movies nowadays have a good production ...This is definitely a different 'Deadpool' than in 'Origins:Wolverine'. Also, I would've understood if they really want to get this Deadpool character from the Marvel comics on the screen that is too talkative and breaks the 4th wall, but almost every character in this movie is partly a comedian. For me it was too much, I prefer serious movies and parts were good, but overall this was over the top and honestly I got headaches from this movie cause it's exhausting to bear a forced comedy.Maybe it's a good movie for binge-watching, but not my cup of tea.I guess it's good they introduced the 'funny' Deadpool character now for future Marvel movies where he would only play a small part, I'd prefer that. Or maybe I just need to let this movie sink in, cause I don't think I hate the Deadpool character they presented, it's just, it was too much at one point.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The Return of the R Rater Superhero Movie,"Deadpool isn't your typical mainstream comic book character, he is rude, crude, violent and not for the kids. And this movie encompasses everything that has made Wade Wilson an unforgettable comic book icon.Deadpool is one part origin story, one part love story and whole lot of ass kicking action. It's humor is unmatched in this genre and it is my belief that after the movie's release you won't be able to escape the Deadpool's grip on popular culture.While the film's villains are definitely its weakest parts, their is a plethora of things to love in this film so it's easy to look past them. The highlight are X-men guest stars Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (picked solely based on her name). Deadpool interacting with the heroic X-Men was definitely my favorite part and really gets you excited for the inevitable sequel.Deadpool is a superhero film we have yet to see grace the big screen and let's hope it starts a new trend of adult orientated superhero films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Deadpool is low & dirty & full of heart,"Who knew when Wade Wilson first appeared in Marvel Comics in 1991, created by Fabian Nicieza and Rob Liefeld as an answer to DC Comics' character Slade Wilson, that his wise- cracking antics would become media gold. Deadpool, the new movie based on the character, solidifies the Marvel anti-hero as a big hitter and a money maker, able to stand on his own. That may not be so surprising with such a long-time fan base eagerly waiting for any and every fourth wall the character will break. What is surprising is that along with all the quips and punches that are expected of Deadpool, his movie brings actual weight and story that grounds the craziness.Deadpool is debauchery. The film rides low and dirty on filthy humor and over the top fights, guns a-blasting and swords at the ready. It cashes in on just about every stereotype that comes with the machismo action genre, but pokes fun at it and at itself. More than that, it oddly turns much of it on its head in various circumstances. Everyone, including Deadpool himself, is a sex object here, and rightfully so. This is a very sexy movie. At the same time, all of the major women of the movie hold more than their own strength, in their own way. These are nice rules to break.While the film is unrelenting in its one-liners, puns and references to pop culture, most of which are spot on and hilarious, there is actually a lot of heart here. The story has a depth that is shocking, and the editing helps to balance that flow in and out of the sane and the loony. It somehow is a cathartic film, not only getting out all that naughtiness and aggression, but also finding ways to connect its characters through heart, love, trust and companionship. So that's why it was released Valentine's Day weekend! It's even a great date movie.Deadpool is a sweetheart, and the role that Ryan Reynolds was born to play. For as silly as it is, Reynolds takes the character seriously, able to deliver the most absurd jokes and the most ridiculous lines of dialogue with complete feeling and gravity. He also shows the most range that I believe I've ever seen him do. This is a flamboyant and spastic character, which is hard enough to make believable and not campy on its own, but to have to run through everything that this film's plot throws at you on top of that is a feat. Reynolds has really found a great performance in the Merc with a Mouth.You come to a movie like Deadpool for the comedy and action, but you get swept up in the love, the horror and the drama, ending up with quite a well rounded flick. In fact, it's one of the heftiest superhero origin stories told on film in recent years. This is a dessert with something for everyone to enjoy, including nuts and a great big banana, topped off with cherry popping childishness. But please, do not bring your children to see this movie. It's a great date movie, remember, but for perverted, consenting adults, like us!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Great fun,"The main triumph of Deadpool is its capability of making its title character sympathetic yet wildly outrageous with his inappropriate sense of humor. Ryan Reynolds certainly deserves much of the credit for this because of his unequivocal commitment to the role; any hesitation or lack of conviction in Deadpool's lines would significantly lessen his character's appeal. Reynolds manages to make Deadpool seem lovable in his most irreverent moments as well as his most vulnerable. However, Deadpool is mostly allowed to get away with his heinous crimes because he is trying to save the ""perfect"" girl against an undeniably evil villain. The writers go all in with both of these overused elements. In any other superhero movie, his romance and revenge quest would be trite, but the enthusiastically delivered snarky jokes overshadow this. 
The humor in Deadpool is for the immature at heart, and isn't nearly as clever as it would like to think. Attempts to poke fun at the superhero genre aren't necessary and seem forced at times. Luckily, the movie is funny enough in its own right to cover for these missteps. The main laughs come from Deadpool's interactions with colorful characters such as his girlfriend, a confused taxi driver, a blind African American woman, and two superhumans. The secondary characters complement Reynolds well despite their limited development and screen time. 
The movie is a joyride until the third act, where unfortunately the requisite action takes precedence over both humor and narrative. The drawn-out battle sequence is bearable for a while because Deadpool is a sympathetic character, but it eventually overplays its welcome. Two characters are present for seemingly no reason at all except for comedic relief (and perhaps sequel material).When the action finally does come to an end, it is abrupt and the movie makes no concluding message. Thus, Deadpool certainly deserves the praise it gets for tapping into a creative use of the superhero genre, but it should not be lauded as groundbreaking. It's pure fun; nothing more, nothing less.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Hands Down,"Best Comic Movie EVER!! laughter after laughter, I can take these insults just like Deadpool can, he is the man.People take these movies too seriously these days, I mean after awhile you forget why you were mad in the first place, some are just too neurotic and judgmental on almost anything they can see or get their greedy hands on, the movie will be a classic and for future generations, this movie was spot on no doubt about it.I will keep seeing this until it runs dry in Theaters and then I will burn it red hot on DVD player.I would easily give half my life to dedicating this movie as the all-time greatest comic movie ever until another can top it but it's DEADPOOL!!, because future movies will suck.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Loved it. Puts the other boring Marvel movies to shame.,"I've only ever cared for Blade and the X-Men films as a movie buff. The other rubbish like Spider-Man, The Fantastic Four, Superman, Guardians of the Galaxy and the myriad of Avenger heroes and their own crap films that they keep rehashing every few years are the most boring, generic, ""epic"" cinema experiences I've ever put up with that weren't aimed entirely at little children such as Ice Age 4 and whatnot.Deadpool was a breath of fresh air. It couldn't have been better. They finally made a superhero movie for people who were kids when these superheroes were big commercial comic book successes. I bought Deadpool comics all throughout the '90s as a teenager and knew exactly what to expect. Ryan Reynolds couldn't be more perfect for the role and Deadpool couldn't be a more perfect character for an adult-oriented hero movie.What bothers me is the amount of 1 out 10 ratings I'm seeing here. Some calling it too foul-mouthed, others calling it too violent, others again, whining about the sex scenes and then others who took their children to see all of this! What, I have to wonder, were you thinking? This movie is rated R and months and months before it was released this was made very, abundantly clear through advertising and Reynolds' own interviews. This movie is rated the same as Reservoir Dogs! The same as Saving Private Ryan, Django Unchained, The Green Mile, Traffic, The Wolf of Wall Street, Seven and Schindler's List! You came into this movie not expecting violence or swearing or sex? You brought your children to watch this movie?!? Why is this getting 1 out of 10, I wonder? The onus, then, is on yourselves. Obviously the fault here is with the common sense of the people buying the tickets and expecting some sort of PG-13 fare. Because as somebody who pays attention to a movie's classification rating I knew exactly what to expect. The movie did not swindle us as movie goers into thinking this was a family film.Once again, I loved this movie, I got all of the references and all of the fourth wall breaks which, no doubt, would have flown over the heads of those who haven't had a keen investment in Deadpool for a long time and would probably take away from a lot of the laughs, so that's to be expected, but I'll just say to anybody reading this review that if a person complains about the violence or the sex or the swearing just disregard their rating of this film just as they disregarded the actual rating of this film. Movies rated R are rated R for a reason.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
This changes everything.,"Ten out of ten doesn't even do justice. Ryan Reynolds and Deadpool have torn apart what you expect from a superhero movie and now offer you a comic book franchise that no other studio can, they have given you a superhero film for strictly adults only. There were 10-12 year olds in the theater, if you let anyone under 16 see this then you are a horrible parent. Deadpool earns its R rating the hard way, lots of brutal violence, lots of nudity and excessive language. Does anyone else miss the old days when our action heroes were in your face brutal, unforgiving and not afraid to use bad language? Take the original Blade for example, it worked brilliantly. Now imagine that with five times the language, more stylized action and a boatload of laughs. I literally laughed from start to finish with this movie, but still found our hero incredibly badass. What do I mean by this changes everything? Fox now has the one thing no other studio does, an over the top hero not only worthy, but demanding of an R rating. Now Warner Bros, Sony and even Marvel Studios will guarantee follow suit. I believe we could now get R rated Wolverine, maybe R rated Batman even. Point is that it is now proved that you can go true to your comic, aim for adults and not just succeed, but bring me back. I'm going tomorrow to make twice in 2 days. If your over 18 and don't like it, then hang yourself, cuz you'll never be entertained.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"A Movie that did no wrong..except for maybe the dirty, dirty, dirty stuff....","...but then if you had any clue, you expected that, whether you appreciate the dirty or not. I will not not go so far as to say it is a perfect movie and I don't know why. Somehow I feel Deadpool, if real, would not appreciate it being called a perfect movie. He would care less what I think as long as I shelled out the money to go see it, although I did cheat and went matinée. I asked my son on his birthday LAST YEAR if there was a movie he wanted to go see. He replied,""Deadpool"", which was 4 months later. I am not a geek or a comic book man and most of my Super Hero knowledge comes from TV and movies. Obviously, I had no idea who Deadpool was. I decided to let the movie introduce me to him and whatever my son was telling. Deadpool is a favorite of his. He would rate the movie at 8.5.Fittingly enough,it has B movie feel, but the CGI is top rate. It is easily the perfect format for Deadpool. BTW - don't be late, the opening credits set the tone for the entire movie and perhaps all you need to know about the movie. Everybody is so afraid that Ryan Reynolds would ruin Deadpool like he ruined Green Lantern or like everyone was afraid that Jack Black would ruin King Kong, but as I understand it, Ryan inserted himself into the creative writing process, which made the words his words. Like a song a singer writes, it is always better and Ryan Reynolds was awesome. Morena Baccarin is perfectly in sync with Ryan in a love and romance for the ageless and immature. Her training in Firefly/Serenity as a high price ""escort"" with Nathan Fillion as love interest was very helpful. Ed Skrein is great as the bad guy. This maybe the only drawback. I imagine that it is Dead Pool's style to focus on the problem in front and not go for the bigger boss or the money behind the bad guy. Of course, that is probably in Dead Pool 2.Like I said in the beginning somewhere, they did no wrong, which is helpful when you are telling a lot of jokes. All of them hit at the right time with the right tenor/tone, which is really difficult to keep it fresh and keep it from being a one joke movie, especially when all the material is irreverent.My recommendation is if you want to see a Super Anti-Hero Action Comedy movie, where most of the jokes were created by the cartoonists of Playboy, Penthouse, High Society and so far way down the sewer and approved by Drunk Frat Boys who whose humor never grew age 12(redundant, I know), then you should sell everything you have and sprint to the best theater near you and plan to live there until Deadpool hit Blue Ray.BTW – I called the ending at the end of the credits. On the way, I told my son that what I want to see is (not going to be a spoiler sport) and they did it. My son thinks I am a Super Hero now and true he thinks I am like Gleek from the Wonder Twins than Thor, but I will take it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
My Thoughts on Deadpool,"Deadpool is the second time Deadpool had been adapted into live action and they did it well this time. There's plenty of well done action and comedy. The action involves a lot of blood, like the R rating suggests, so it's not the best thing for young children or anyone who doesn't like anything too gory.Deadpool is definitely one of those characters that deserve the R rating in which he actually got with this movie with his healing factor and him being the well known merc with a mouth (merc = mercenary), in which ties into what I just said previously. He is the Marvel characters that is most likely to use f-bombs in my opinion, so yeah. So if you don't like a lot of gore or swearing, simply this isn't for you.This movie does showcase Deadpool getting his healing factor and has him taking revenge on the person took away his looks. That's the main thread that ties the plot together, so it can be a good movie for those people who likes action and simpleness behind the action.That's mainly what I want to say about this movie, so if you like action, with that, gory action, and comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Well, that was fun","A lot of superhero movies favor special effects over character (I'm looking at you, 2012's The Avengers), but perhaps because Deadpool had a relatively low budget for this sort of thing - something I only know because I read it on wikipedia - this movie is full of character. The protagonist is a vengeance seeking madman constantly breaking the forth wall, his best friend is a hipster bartender who gambles on his brief longevity, and he and his girlfriend (the ridiculously attractive Morena Baccarin) engage in the dark clever banter you'll love if you're a fan of the series You're the Worst).Deadpool proves that giving your characters personality does not mean you can't also have great action scenes, such as the crazed one that begins the movie (and clarifies the funny and perplexing title sequence). I found the action in this movie far more exhilarating than the bigger-is-better approach of some movies (I'm looking at you again, Avengers).Overall, this is as fun and funny as Guardians of the Galaxy and has action as memorable as that in X-Men: First Class. Ryan Reynolds beautifully plays Deadpool as a psychotic version of Spider-Man, and really, the whole cast is excellent.This is a sort of tangential X-Men movie, but it still exhibits a lot of what makes that series the best of the Marvel universe.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Pretty hilarious, but not as great of a Marvel film I would say","It was certainly one of the most intense films I have seen the studio do. I've seen and love Kick Ass, so none of the raunchy crap doesn't bother me. Ryan Reynolds is a pretty decent comedian with his fast-paced dialogue being a plus. The film also keeps the audience engaged with the rampant comedy and hardcore action. I wasn't too terribly satisfied with some the storyline, although the in-between-time scenes during the first half of the film were a unique idea. As a joke, he would probably fit pretty terribly with the Avengers squad, let alone the X-Men with his ""annoyance."" A decent fast-paced superhero comedy overall.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The movie that deserves 11 stars out of 10,"After seeing the trailer a few times and while becoming slightly impatient, we had very high expectations, however Deadpool overtook them. It is a movie for big children, forbidden to children, so do leave your -14 at home :) A very blunt humour, which makes it more realistic, awesome special effects and the general idea that all the cast had lots of fun making it. Ryan Reynolds is at his best, so much better than the Green Lantern, which was not his fault, but this is one of the differences between DC Comics and Marvel Comics.

The Surprise of 2016!,"People thought this movie was going to be an overhyped, poorly-made Marvel Film, but turned out to be one of the very best Marvel films, ever.

R Rated Comic Book Story,"This movie is definitely for the 20's crowd. It is a comic book story which appeals to the young, but the lewd scenes and language is not for teenagers (it's rated R) and definitely not for the morally faint, and the body count gore is not for the faint-hearted. I gave it a 7 because it is overall fun, funny, and entertaining; but the plot is simple revenge, with a side note of shallow romance, with a few snide remarks in psychological therapy. It's an experiment in the anti-hero where the protagonist character traits are worse than ever, looking villainous. A few scenes don't make sense, such as what the villain was trying to accomplish, how the hero escaped the rebar, and a few others, that left me wondering how to fill in the blanks. Finally, some lame explanations were made for a few puzzling scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

The Movie We Have Been Waiting For,"This is the movie all Deadpool fans have been waiting for. Crude, rude, and anything but subdued, Deadpool at times plays too much like fan service than a movie, but what better character to finally get his moment in the spotlight.Everyone, behind and in front of the camera, did a phenomenal job bringing the merc with a mouth to life. Tim Miller did a great job with Deadpool's origin, and the way it is handled is brilliant. Ryan Reynolds is Deadpool. He is perfect in the role, no one else could possibly play Deadpool. The cast around him is great as well, with Morena Baccarin playing a very believable love interest and T.J. Miller supplying some nice back-and-forth scenes. Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead are also great additions, and I hope more X-Men characters interact with Deadpool in the future.As far as pure entertainment goes, this is as good as it can get. 90% of the jokes hit, and the ones that don't were in the trailer. The humor is raunchy and juvenile, working perfectly with the awesome action scenes. There are countless bad ass moments in this film, and the R rating allows them to have these moments. They don't abuse the R rating, but it serves it's purpose.The only ""flaw"" I have with this film is at times it kind of gets lost in its fan service. There are a few scenes that are definitely funny, but serve no purpose but to please fans of the comics. I still enjoyed the moments as a fan of the character, and I get why they did it was to make sure hardcore Deadpool fans were satisfied after the long wait for their character to hit the big screen.Overall, Deadpool gives its character the movie he deserves. It's consistently hilarious, and the action scenes will leave you with plenty to discuss with your buddies. It's more fan service than a complete film, but I am definitely OK with that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Bad taste extragavanca,"I think most of us have been expecting this movie. Or at least something like it. A superhero film that is a bit more... I would say adult, but that doesn't quite fit. More willing to cross the line of good taste, a film willing to be gory, immature and full of adult humour, as well as brutal violence.And who better to embody the ideal of bad taste than Deadpool, the fourth wall breaking punkster of Marvel. He's pretty much what would happen if you gave a Looney Tunes character Wolverine's powers and removed the kid filter. And he's awesome because of it!Now, this is not actually Ryan Reynold's first time playing this character, as he also appeared in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, but the less said about that particular incident, the better. Suffice to say, they didn't treat the character kindly, and apparently Reynolds has always wanted to return back to the character and give him a movie worthy of his insanity. Well, mission accomplished. Deadpool is exactly the kind of movie it needs to be. It's ugly, hilarious, constantly veering between brutal violence, cringeworthy dark humour and the occasional somber moment, doesn't take itself at all seriously and is actually well-done movie in general terms as well. Especially because they crack jokes at the expense of the relatively cheap budget. Like the fact that they could only afford the licences of two very minor X-Men characters.If you like Deadpool, you're going to love this film. If you have no idea who I'm talking about, do go see the film if you like dark humour or the idea of an R rated superhero film. Because trust me, it earns that rating.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Marvel's maximum effort to deliver wet dream about super anti-hero. Yes, it's as delightful and vulgar as it sounds, especially delivered by the Merc with a Mouth.","From the first minute you'll know what to expect from Deadpool, this is a movie which bluntly admits the director is overpaid and one of the characters is CG, then using Ryan Reynolds in the cover of magazine while random henchmen is burning as introduction. Aside from all the silliness, its love story manages to establish connection better than Wolverine ever had with his unhealthy obsession with Jean Grey and that one girl from his origin story.Ryan Reynolds works as the titular character Deadpool in the same manner Robert Downey Jr. worked as Iron-Man, he's already half the character he's playing. He does not shy from self-deprecation, in fact most of the jokes are in expense of the man, mainly about how ugly he is. A healthy dose of pop culture references also helps in making him more amiable even though he's made out of profanity and vulgarity.Ed Skrein finds a better success as the villain here than he did as the new Transporter. He's the fine opposite of Deadpool with almost the same physical built and quite the charisma, though more on the grim side. Morena Baccarin as Vanessa is looking like normal lovely brunette, yet she's humorous enough to set her character apart. Apparently, the experience as love interest in Gotham might help in that.Deadpool live and die, or perhaps regenerate, by its comedy, it's his thing, breaking the fourth wall with real life references and talking with audience. This is an advantage other superheroes are deprived of, he's already more enjoyable due to his ability to mock practically everything. Between all its galore of decapitation and cursing, this is a legitimate comedy for not all ages, certainly not for kids.Action is pretty solid, presentable CG and choreography make it a visual treat. Its chase scene has high resemblance from another blockbuster and even animation from video game. This is not the world's end type of crisis from Avengers, Deadpool is not that selfless, yet it's a proper visual one might expect from Marvel. Selection of soundtrack is also commendable, using a more direct and classic approach for the tunes from Deadpool himself.Deadpool delivers what other superheroes, lacking figurative regenerating balls or guts, won't even attempt; crude jokes, brutal display and heavy set of sarcasm. This might not be for everyone, but it's every bit orgasmically fun as one expects from Merc with a Mouth.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Absolutely HILARIOUS - DEADPOOL (#1),"NOT only did I find this movie absolutely hilarious, but the way they made Deadpool pick on X-Men, Ryan Renoalds (himself), and the Green Lantern, JUST made me want to watch it even more !!!! The way they phrase words and emphasizing on certain words and phrases, is just out-standing ! I have watched this movie over 10 times the night I purchased it, and I can not stop laughing !! It is GREAT !! I LOVE IT !! Now, as I was doing research, I did not know until today that Deadpool IS part of the X-Men series ! The original title of this movie is -----> X-Men Orgins: Deadpool, also known as - X-Men: Deadpool. Another part I noticed is, in the beginning, in the black truck, one of the bad guys' head was being rammed into the stereo. Each hit changed the station. JUST for a brief second or two, you will hear Batman's music, which I thought was funny too. There are a bunch of little things like that, that are hidden within the movie that you will hear and see, but you will not realize it's there.

its good if you like comics not if you like x-men movies,"I'm not a fan-boy of anything so I don't give 10/10 for anything I liked slightly. So 7/10 is a good review from me. There was only a couple of times I found my mind wandering in this. There were times I found the wisecracking annoying, but I did not mind that because it was supposed to be annoying. I liked the comic book style. For example, we spend a lot of time in silly dialogue with a taxi driver while ignoring the main plot - just as you'd expect in a comic of this nature.I found the story to be interesting and sufficiently different from other hero films to make it worthwhile (some reminiscences of Watchmen - which I enjoyed). I found the main villain also to be good; robotic in his evil as to be expected but also in some ways human (in a ""its nothing personal friend but I'm forced to hurt you now"" kind of way). The villain side-kick is also quite a scary woman. The involvement of the x-men was rightfully a side-issue as this was the story of Deadpool.On the whole its slightly more artistic than the usual pulp superhero movie, as was Watchmen and dare I say it, Guardians of the Galaxy (but more adult than either of those).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I'm not sure,"Okay I don't know where to start there were times where I liked it and times where I didn't like it all. I feel like it had more potential. first of all too many dirty joke. and I like dirty jokes but this was just too much.. I felt like I watched a teenage boy trapped in a grown mans body and he had just discovered the words: D***, penis, fart, masturbate and F***. AND I don't know the whole ""be a bad ass douche and you'll get your D** wet"".. I don't feel like that sends out the right message to young guys.. I don't know?? One thing I liked a lot though was that they opened up/broke the fourth wall. (if you don't know what that is look it up it) Overall it was pretty entertaining and a lot of raw action, but you have to see it for what it really is ""FANTASY, MARVEL, Fiction"". Oh, and there are better films to take your girlfriend, this is more of a ""chilling with the mates"" kind of film. Words to help describe this film: cancer, revenge, D***, fart, mansion, self touching. I give it 7 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A very fun film,"Deadpool is a Marvel film that steps outside the box a tad; they go for an edgier film this time around, that breaks the fourth wall, has a good bit of gore (which many Marvel films lack), and is more humorous. Personally, I feel the formula worked well. Deadpool is an enjoyable films, with a ton of laughs and some good action.The film follows Wade, a sarcastic mercenary with little to care for in the world. He falls for a prostitute, Vanessa, and the two fall head over heels for each other. Wade, however, is diagnosed with terminal cancer, and in desperation, leaves Vanessa for an experimental medical facility that turns ordinary people into mutants, a la X-Men. The goons who run the facility, however, are sadistic, and wish to turn their patients into mindless drones for hire. Wade is scarred from the procedure, and seeks revenge on the Facility manager, Francis, and his goons for what they have done. He also looks to get back Vanessa, even though he looks a bit like a hamburger patty.Deadpool's story is pretty bog-standard super-hero stuff, and has little to offer. It felt generic enough, as many Marvel films do, in my opinion. However, the romance between Wade and Vanessa was genuinely interesting. Both played rough but fair characters, with a lot in common, and the banter between the two was sweet and fun. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool is also a great fit. He plays the part like he was born to do so. The films itself is quite funny, with tons of fourth wall breaking winks, small jabs at the entertainment industry, self-referential humour, and the like. Reynolds even makes jokes about himself. Their were a lot of funny pop-culture references as well, although these will surely be dated by the time next year hits.The action in the film was quite good as well, as it is in Marvel's films. Lots of fancy explosions, good fights and so on abound. Two x-Men make appearances as well, and it was great to see Marvel taking on a few - hopefully they will retain control for a Marvel led X-Men film in the future! Small complaint about the CGI, however. Their were some parts with excellent CGI, but some very poor ones as well. The establishing shot of the aircraft carrier under construction in the final act is especially poor, and jarring enough to bring me out of the film. A few of these issues exist, but the CGI in much of the action scenes holds up well enough.All in all, a really fun and enjoyable Marvel film. I do enjoy the more humorous Marvel films (this, Guardians etc.) as it adds an extra layer of entertainment beyond the bog-standard superhero film, played to death almost in modern times. Reynolds was great, as were most of the side actors, the action was cool and fun. Aside from a weaker story and some shaky CGI, this film really holds its own. I look forward to more of this from Marvel, and this film can be easily recommended for superhero fans, action film junkies, and those into dark comedies. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
MY Two Cents,I will admit that I had trepidation's about seeing this movie I was concerned that they wouldn't do the Character of Deadpool Justice. I am happy to say I had no reason for concern. I can honestly say that I was totally impressed with this movie. I found that they kept to the spirit of the comic character extremely well. I thought the writing was exceptionally well done. I like the way the story unfolded. The Special effects were there but they weren't over the top. Lastly I have to say that in the end I think it was one of my favorite movies to watch this year thus far. It had action it had laughs and a bit of a twisted moral in its own way. I know some people were upset with it but I have to be honest I think those are the people that had never picked up a Deadpool comic or even bothered to actually watch the previews. Which to me is the fault of the viewer not the movie.. I mean if your going to go spend money on a show do some research. That goes for those parents that took their kids to the movie.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
As good as a Deadpool movie was ever going to be.,"Deadpool is a superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. It is on the same universe as the X-Men films and it is directed by Tim Miller. It stars Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T. J. Miller, Gina Carano, Leslie Uggams and Brianna Hildebrand. In Deadpool, Wade Wilson hunts the man who gave him an accelerated healing factor but also a scarred physical appearance. I liked this movie a lot, it's probably up there on my X-Men movie ranking. Though my favorites are still First Class and Days of Future Past. Ryan Reynolds is P E R F E C T on the role of Deadpool. He has comedic talent and is very good at acting. The jokes he makes on the movie are straight up hilarious, and the puns are just as clever. This is definitely as good as a Deadpool movie was ever going to be. Though it was clear they had a small budget, they still made the most of it and nothing looks fake at all. The action is amazingly shot and superbly done. There's no shaky cam or whatever that thing is that other cheap action movies do, here is just great stunt work mixed in with great visuals and hilarious one liners all around. The fourth wall breaks are genius and well though out. They had great timing and were actually funny. While the overall story might be a bit formulaic, still all the other amazing things just surpass that and make us forget the abomination that was X-Men Origins.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Try-hard dross topped such mundane Hollywood humour.,"This is another one of those movies that try to be fresh in its genre (which it does achieve) but try exceptionally hard to sound witty and unfunny (which it didn't achieve) and instead end up being downright annoying. Sure there are parts that I really enjoyed, but with the amount of hype this had, I expected it to be the movie of the century. Try Kick-Ass if you want an actual laugh out loud experience. This ""Oooh I'm different from all superheroes because I'm arrogant and funny and quick witted"" character didn't work and it's not because I didn't get or get offended by the humour. Sometimes it was funny and cool, but 9/10 the jokes just made me roll my eyes. Nice try though. Oh and it is incredibly violent throughout for your average superhero viewing so be warned. I'm not sure if that made me like or hate the movie more, it was just an added feature that did nothing to fuel a reaction from me.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Leave the kiddies at home,"Wow, where to start with this one??? It was my favorite movie I've seen in a long time...(yes that includes Star Wars the Force Awakens).I'm used to taking my two sons to every Marvel release, and although it's rated R and my kids wouldn't be allowed in anyway, I still blush at the thought of it. This one is definitely a mashup of Jackass and the X- Men.Deadpool is as deprecating of a film as you're ever likely to see. It also skewers the entire superhero genre, as well as the acting talents of many of Hollywood's biggest stars, including it's own leading man. Much has been made of it demolishing the ""Fourth Wall"" of Hollywood as well...but it also destroys ""Walls 5-10"" as well.Ridiculously profane, heaps of gratuitous violence, nudity, and sex..and yes grandfatherly Stan Lee, in a cameo as a DJ at an all nude strip club...what's not to love??Deadpool breaks all of the non-existent rules of superhero movies, because no one said that all superheroes have to strictly adhere to an unwritten code of conduct. There's not much to the movie we haven't seen in other superhero/mutant films. Guy turned into a mutant by some bad guys. Guy wants revenge against those bad guys. Guy gains revenge on these bad guys using his mutant powers.Yeah it's a formula we have seen before, but not in this over the top way. This movie is big and bold, and not afraid to take shots at everyone, and everything within its genre and beyond. I haven't laughed so hard at a movie since I saw Bad Grandpa, and its no mistake that I mentioned that particular movie, while providing my two ""cents"" on Deadpool.Somewhere Captain America is shaking his head right now, and Johnny Knoxville and his band of puerile mischief makers are laughing their butts off.Decidedly different, and hilariously funny this is something you HAVEN'T seen before...just make sure you leave the kiddos behind for this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
This film has its audience.,"I'm aware most will feel a 10/10 is unjustified and that even an 8/10 is too high. People are also very upset this is becoming considered one of the best rated super-hero films of all-time. What they are missing is that this film did exactly what it set out to do and was everything it promised its fans. We had the test footage of this video, we had trailers that revealed just about everything. Those of us that loved it, knew exactly what this film was before filming was finished.This is a film that fans pushed for. This is a film many can say they had a hand in helping become a reality. Fox was terrified to make this film, it barely squeaked through the cracks. Their jaws are now on the floor and are probably ready to listen when it comes to some fresh ideas.If you have ever read a DeadPool comic you know how faithful this was. The things they had wanted to do and planned, weren't in the budget. They cut entire scenes out and had to change others. Seriously, just watch him talk about all the things they had to do just to stay in budget. The bullet count had to be low, the character forgetting his guns in a certain scene, the lack of other x-men, all cut corners. However I think working in these parameters did nothing but help push the creativity.So,this film was perfect in the fact it was enjoyable and it ended up being what was promised.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie.From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years.After all the 'straight' superhero flicks of which we might have seen too many, this is a fresh breeze and welcome addition to the genre.

You either like it or hate it.,"WHEN watching the trailer for Deadpool, I expected it to be about a wise-cracking and crass superhero with a penchant for showing off his taut body in a red spandex outfit. My expectation was proved true when I watched it. I just never expected it to be filled with dollops of crude humour.The film actually has a soft spot, even though it's littered with profanities and action scenes that would make Arnold Schwarzenegger go green with envy.On the surface, it's about a superhero whose face is so scarred that people in the streets avoid walking near him. Deep down, however, it's about whether his girlfriend can look him in the eye and accept him for who he is.Ryan Reynolds doesn't have a good track record playing superheroes. His Green Lantern (2011) quickly faded into oblivion.

Reynolds Wraps It Up Nicely,"(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Ryan Reynolds makes us care about this violent superhero and that's the better half of the fun.GRADE: B-PLOT SUMMARY: After a scientific experiment renders him disfigured but endowed with superhuman strength and powers, Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool, an anti-hero who wants revenge.JIM'S REVIEW: The Marvel Superhero Factory unleashes another action figure from its assembly line of comic book personalities, a hip but crazed vigilante who goes by the name Deadpool. Coming from the second tier of players, instead of its popular A-Team of Avengers, this brand of superhero has some interesting traits unlike his predecessors. Besides loving to kick ass and destroy his foes, this character lobs double entendres and curses to anyone in his vicinity, beats everyone to the bloodiest of pulp (hence, the film's adult rating), and breaks down any walls in his way, especially the fourth one with his pithy and snide asides to our movie-going audience.￼The plot is a typical revenge / action movie. Wade Wilson (a wonderfully charming Ryan Reynolds, who uses his sex appeal most appealingly) takes the form of our favorite mercenary, Deadpool, ready to do battle with his maker, Francis Freeman a.k.a. Ajax (a menacing Ed Skrein), a sadistic scientist and his lovely Igor named Angel Dust (Gina Carano).Of course, Deadpool has help from a supporting group of friends that include his girlfriend, Vanessa (a winning Morcena Baccarin), loyal sidekick, Weasel (a wise-cracking T.J. Miller), and some other X-Men crusaders, Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The action is non-stop and so are the jokes, which land most of the time. Deadpool's foul mouth works overtime to entertain his adult followers between the blood spatter and it all surprisingly works, excluding the over indulgence of too much slow-mo and CGI effects, frenetic editing, and shaky hand-held camera-work.￼But the filmmakers never take the character or his plight so seriously as in other films of this ilk and are more obsessed with the dark humor aspects in their story. Credit goes to the screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick with their zingy one-liners and director Tim Miller, who gives the film the needed jolt of energy which allows this hero some distinctive qualities that other superheroes in the Marvel universe lack, primarily a underlying sadness that define the human character inside the superhuman.But it is Mr. Reynolds who contributes the most to the film's success. The role fits him like a suit. His anti-charm is the real thing and the actor uses his physical presence to the nth degree, frontal nude scene notwithstanding.Deadpool is far from dead. This avenger has legs (and muscle) with just the right amount of appeal. The movie will make a killing at the box office with a sequel on its way as we speak. So, fans of this comic book genre (and many new devotees) can enjoy the start of a beautiful friendship with a new adult action hero and all of his profanity and insights.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Rude, crude and wonderfully entertaining","I saw it last night and thought it a wonderful, hilarious and entertaining film. So many different and clever humour to laugh at and Deadpool's character was magnetic.I thought the bad guy was very well played and liked that the story was a simple origin/revenge tale rather than some over the top/end of the world/buildings being sucked into the air extravaganza.It meant they concentrated on the characters more and were less worried about achieving the killer money shot for the trailers. Maybe having less budget is not such a hindrance.I loved all the interactions, the romance was wonderfully refreshing and the action top notch. There was laughing and gasping out loud.I really hope the film does well as I've been impressed with Ryan's efforts to get this made, loved the novel marketing and respect the studio's courage to sink some dollar into an r-rated Superhero film. I'd love to see the making of features on this as I think they would be fascinating.I'd put this up with Kick Ass and Kingsman for providing all round adult entertainment.Great work Ryan and Tim, can't wait for a sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Funny but corny and juvenile,"Like so many of today's ""action"" movies, millions of dollars are spent on CGI explosions, people beating each other up, and highly realistic renditions of bullets and swords ripping apart human flesh and bone. If these are the kinds of movies you like, you might like Deadpool since there is PLENTY of that going on.Many Hollywood movies today also have a highly simplistic moral plot which boils down to getting the audience to sympathize with ""good people"" hurting ""bad people"" in horrific ways because the bad people hurt the good people first in equally horrific ways. Essentially it is all about justified violence and hatred, or an eye for an eye if you will. Beneath this simplistic moralism, the writers usually try to throw in a love story to make you feel good about killing all those bad people because there is romance going on. In this sense Deadpool is exactly like every other big budget action movie coming out of Hollywood these days, especially the Marvel comic variety - endless fights, brutal killings, non-stop explosions and car crashes all done in hyper-realistic fashion with the audience rooting to kill the evil-doers.Where Deadpool differs somewhat from this formula is that it seems more like it was written by the cast of Mad magazine, with more clever, if still childish jokes that do make you laugh more than a few times. In fact virtually every line delivered in this movie is either a hyper-sarcastic joke or a clever put down. While often funny, the dialog is too contrived for me and polished to give it any soul or sense of believability, despite the many laughs.You can probably tell that I am not a big fan of these kinds of action movies, and that is true. Many people will probably like this movie but I found it totally formulaic and it seemed like the writers were trying too hard. On top of that, too much CGI and too little soul. Still it was a fun movie to watch even if I kept rolling my eyes throughout most of the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Pathetic,  violent,  pointless movie","I really regretted spending money on this. Wanted to leave the cinema after first 15 mins. Chosed it as the ratings were high and was described as a comedy. I did not laugh once. The movie shows detailed violence - not sure who enjoys watching heads to be shot through or cut off. Total disrespect towards human life. There was lots of unnecessary swearing and pathetic predictable jokes, i.e. penis jokes, saying f***ing in every sentence etc. Unless you enjoy watching violence and think swearing is funny you won't enjoy this movie. Maybe it's suitable for someone with low IQ or a teenager. The plot is also pointless and some nudity and sex scenes are included too as a predictable part of the movie.

Brill,"This might be my favorite superhero movie of all time. There is simply no comparison. Let me start by saying how happy I am that they did not let Hollywood ruin this film by giving it a pg 13 rating. They allowed deadpool to be himself. It is witty, funny, and of course action packed with violence. I am kind of ticked they cut the budget on this movie, I can only imagine how much better the original script would have been. Usually when they do superhero movies I look at them with dread. Seeing Ben Aflack as batman makes me think instant bust. When I saw the horrible actor from green lantern staring I thought man they are going to trash another superhero movie. But absolutely nothing could have destroyed this script. It is so well written. The director did a great job in keeping it together and the acting simply did their job which is all they needed to do. I would watch this movie again in a heart beat.

Celebrate Valentine's Day with Deadpool,"After years of development hell we finally have a version of Deadpool that comic book fans were asking for. Ryan Reynolds returns once again as Wade Wilson (he played the character in X-Men Origins Wolverine) and delivers a performance that is one of the highlights of his career.Minor spoilers of the movies plot. Deadpool follows a mercenary turned good guy (one could argue) who finds a girl who's ""crazy matches his crazy""; everything seems perfect until our ""hero"" gets diagnosed with terminal cancer. A mysterious organisation that promises to cure his cancer and give him powers beyond his imagination contacts him. In a not so shocking twist they turn out to be using people with serious health conditions to experiment on and use them as ""super slaves"". I was a bit worried that the backstory of how Wade Wilson became Deadpool would take half of the movie. That is not the case the blend between action and story development makes this movie one of marvel's best.The main thing everyone wants to know is the movie actually any good, and the short answer is yes. At the beginning of the production there were talks of making the movie PG-13 (American equivalent of 12A), fortunately it was announced that the movie would indeed be rated R (American equivalent of 15 rating). Of course because the movie is rated 15 the budget was not as big as it could have been and it shows. The whole scale is smaller compared to other superhero movies, but I think that makes the movie stand out even more. Even with the rating everyone was hoping for, there were doubts if the violence, swearing and the nudity would not be toned down. I can gladly say that there is no need to worry. We were promised a movie for the fans and that is exactly what we got. The main reason why Deadpool is so popular as a character is because of his personality and wisecracking attitude, the movie is great at showing that. There are numerous 4th wall breaks, dirty jokes and surprisingly a lot of swearing. Even the opening credits make fun of the cast and the director of the movie. If you are familiar with the X-Men movie universe you might catch few more inside jokes jokes, but if you are not, that does not make the film less fun to watch. The movie even makes fun of the budget of the movie by saying that the only two X-Men that we ever see are Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (in my opinion the greatest superhero name ever) Lets talk about the supporting cast. Morena Baccarin plays Vannesa, Wade Wilsons love interest, which automatically makes her the damsel in distress, that our ""hero"" has to save. Her character is not really developed enough to form an opinion, but the few scenes she is in Baccarin does the best she can with the character. Next I want to talk about my favourite character in the movie (excluding Deadpool) Weasel. Played by T.J. Miller Weasel is Wade's best friend I have to say he is not given a lot of screen time, but when he is on the screen he does a marvellous job. You have to remember that the movie is short and the supporting cast suffers from that quite a bit. Ed Skrein and Gina Carano play Ajax and Angel dust respectively. Their characters are a bit one-dimensional. They are evil just for the sake of being evil. There is no back-story for both of them. There are rumours of an extended cut, so we can hope to learn more of them in that. The two X-Men in the film are great especially Brianna Hildebrand who plays Negasonic Teenage Warhead. She acts like a typical teenager would, some of the best jokes involve her and Deadpool talking. All in all even with a small budget the action is still great, the violence is oven the top and while the special effects are not perfect they are still good. Even if you are not a fan of superhero genre but you like fun action movies you should at least give this movie a chance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The role that Ryan Reynolds was born to play,"Deadpool is a superhero comedy film based on the Marvel comic of the same name. As an adaptation of a crude, violent and hilarious comic book, it is very successful. For me, it has dethroned Kick-Ass as the funniest comic book film I have ever seen.Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a wise-cracking mercenary who protects his clients from unwanted associates. One day, Wade is diagnosed with cancer in most of his important internal organs. In an attempt to cure the cancer, Wade undergoes a top secret experiment which leaves him with accelerated healing powers and a sick, twisted sense of humour. As a result, he becomes Deadpool, the ""Merc With A Mouth"".Filled with all the meta-humour and action one would expect to see, Deadpool is one of the best comic book adaptations to date. You know a movie is off to a good start when even the opening credits have you laughing. There's no denying that this is the role that Ryan Reynolds was born to play. He embodies Deadpool so perfectly, that it is impossible for me to see any other actor portraying the character. There's rarely a dull moment.I rate it 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Ryan Reynolds was born to play this role.,"Where do I start...Well, this is complete redemption for Fox. After the awful introduction in X-Men Origins: Wolverine(less said the better), this movie was an apology to the fans.Now, I'll be honest, the plot is a pretty straight-forward revenge story. It's very simple and easy to follow. It doesn't do anything new in that department as it is an origin story, but it's told with more flare. You would think jumping from place to place, flashback to flashback would confuse you and many other people, but it doesn't. So kudos to director Tim Miller, Ryan Reynolds, and writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick for a sharp clear vision of the movie. They knew what they were going for and executed it very well. The origin told through flashbacks was a breath of fresh air. Something I admired about Man of Steel. I feel superhero origin stories are best told through flashbacks.The visuals are solid, and the action sequences are pretty stellar. Small in scale(cause of their budget) but nevertheless, very fun. There's no PG-13 compromise here, the filmmakers absolutely do not hold back. This is hard R, with nudity, including Ryan Reynolds's bare ass, hyper-stylized violence, blood, gore, foul language, and dirty jokes. So if you're someone who gets easily offended by this, I would advise you to stay away. But even with that being said, one must admit, this brings something new to the superhero genre, and it's a film made for comic fans such as myself.The cast is great. In typical fashion the villains are not too fleshed out, they do present a threat, but it's nothing special. Ed Skrein as Ajax and Gina Carano as Angel Dust do their job at being evil. T.J. Miller as Deadpool's sidekick is hysterical with quippy and crude lines. Leslie Uggams is Blind Al. She and Deadpool share some nice and funny banter with each other. Colossus is voiced by Stefan Kapicic, played by Andre Tricoteux, and his young trainee Negasonic Teenage Warhead is played by Brianna Hildebrand and they have their fun moments with Deadpool as well. Colossus certainly does a lot more than he ever did in the previous X-Men films, although I am a bit annoyed Daniel Cudmore did not return for the role for continuity's sake, this Colossus is a more faithful interpretation to the comics.I'd also like to mention I'm not big on superhero romance. On occasion they do work, like Captain America and Peggy Carter, Spider-Man and Gwen or Mary Jane, and I guess Tony Stark and Pepper Potts, but outside of that I never really buy into them, they just seem like an afterthought, but here in this film the chemistry works. Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin have fabulous chemistry between each other. I know it sounds like a broken record, but chemistry really counts in all type of films, so it was pleasantly shocking to see it work on screen, especially from a movie like Deadpool.Now lets talk about Ryan. Man, from now on, every time I read a Deadpool comic, I'm going to hear his voice. Like the title of my review, he was born to play this role. Even in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, prior to the abysmal transformation, when he was just Wade Wilson, Reynolds killed it. He carries the film very well and he does a great job making him almost sympathetic. You know for a fact Wade Wilson is not a great person, but what he goes through in the somewhat difficult torture sequences, you come to care and personally want to see him get his revenge on Ajax. Again, Deadpool's jokes are hilarious and Ryan definitely knows how to deliver it effectively.Deadpool isn't a perfect film, it does have some minor problems, but it's a hell of a fun ride. It's face paced, never boring, consistently funny, and filled with clever fourth wall breaking moments. Deadpool himself even pokes fun at Ryan's career, other superheroes and even Fox, the studio itself. Deadpool subverts the superhero formula resulting in a hilarious and violent thrill ride all in it's non-family friendly glory, and if you weren't sold on the marketing of this film already, then I don't know what to tell you. I have no doubt that this will be successful and I'm only anticipating the sequel even more. I hope this film will un-retire Hugh Jackman so I can see a proper Wolverine and Deadpool fight in a future installment or even X-Force.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Deadpool is the most unpleasant and surprisingly entertaining superhero movie with brilliant humor.,"Deadpool (2016): We may have seen a lot of superheroes but you will never meet the one as Deadpool.He is the most mischievous,obnoxious humor filled guy I had ever seen.He is always mean to others and never takes things seriously.He is selfish,vulgar,rude and what not.He didn't have any quality to be superhero except having some mutative abilities.This is the first feature film of this crazy guy.So how is it???Plot: Wade Wilson(Ryan Reynolds) is a small-time mercenary. He meets Vanessa(Morena Baccarin) and falls in love. Life is idyllic until one day he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Things look bleak but a man appears who says he can be cured, through a treatment that gives him superhero powers. After initially turning him down, Wilson agrees, and meets the man behind the project, Ajax whose actual name is Francis(Ed Skrein). While undergoing the treatment he discovers that it will involve him becoming a mutant, and he will need to undergo several painful tests to discover what his mutant abilities are. Plus, Ajax is a sadist. The treatment results in Wilson getting powers of accelerated healing but also leaves him terribly disfigured. Ajax tries to keep him a prisoner but he escapes. He now has two aims: find Vanessa and make Ajax pay for what he did to him. Killing Ajax may not be as easy it seems, as Ajax is also a mutant and the meddling superhero Colossus and his sidekick Negasonic Teenage Warhead keep getting in the way. Oh, and Wade Wilson is now operating under an alias: Deadpool.Plus Points:1)Deadpool: Deadpool is one of the most fun superhero I had ever seen.While all the superheroes are busy in saving people's lives,Deadpool has his own issues and deals in hos own way.He has zero morality and kindness.Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him.He even broke the fourth wall and talks with audience which is a good point.2)Humor in latter half: Initial half of Deadpool has some good humor but nothing special.But in latter half I couldn't stop laughing because Deadpool never looked back with his humor.There are a lot of LOL moments which I loved.Especially few scenes are remarkable for its humor.3)Climax: Climax is awesome with brilliant mix of humor and action.The scene where they make a slow motion walk and the scene where villain gives a superhero entry is hilarious.Even the scene where Collosus fights with Angel is awesome.4)Performances: Ryan Reynolds is perfect as Deadpool.He showed the character's innocence and insanity pitch perfectly.Others also gave decent performances.5)VFX: VFX is awesome and flawless.Initial scene where car blasts with Deadpool inside is creative and is one of the best ones.Minus Points:1)Initial half: Initial half of the movie is not as expected and gave some mixed reaction on this movie as it has no great moments.Even humor is not that good so I wondered how this movie got such highly positive reviews but latter half proved me wrong.2)Level of Profanity: Deadpool is one of the most obnoxious superhero movie with high level of profanity.There is at least a single use of f**k,a*****e etc...So this movie is surely not for everyone.Mostly its focuses on teens.So,Deadpool is the most unpleasant and surprisingly entertaining superhero movie with brilliant humor.My rating 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Congratulation Ryan Reynolds !,"Now i'm going to be honest i didn't know what to think going in to this movie and so i didn't really have high hopes and HOLY HELL did this movie amaze me!!!Right from the opening credits you get an immediate idea of the humour in this movie and it is hilarious whether it's the crude humour, the sexual innuendos, the 4th wall breaks or the puns aimed at Reynolds previous movies it was hilarious. Reynolds perfectly portrayed the character of Deadpool and i am so happy they gave him a second chance because he is the perfect choice.I can't really find any negatives to this movie except maybe the simple plot and the bland villain but then i would say that it was just so we could focus on Deadpool so in my opinion a good choice.Overall this not just a great superhero movie but a great movie and with the huge amount of superhero movies being released this year Deadpool has set the bar high and all the others will have hard work to do to follow it up !9/10 Awesome!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
An odd and fun parody on the genre,"Deadpool, this crazy superhero that mercilessly kills and refuses to call himself a hero. Wade Wilson is an ex special forces operative who after his service works as a mercenary in New York. He meets the prostitute Vanessa and falls in love, but cancer forces him away from her. After voluntarily signing up to a clinic that claims to be able to cure his illness, he is deceived and tortured until his body deforms and mutate so he gets superhuman powers. Ashamed of his new appearance and driven by revenge, he takes the alter ego Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds plays the red avenger that half mad kills his way through the underworld of New York, looking for his creator.Deadpool joins Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man, as Marvel's latest more comical superhero films. The humor has always been there in the Marvel films, but these three films at times, belongs to the comedy genre. Deadpool is really a sort of parody that both mocks and salutes the superhero genre. Movie references and classic clichés are fired in all directions when Deadpool also turns to speak directly into the camera. Also sometimes the film completely stops and our hero narratively and humorously explains exactly what is happening. It's sort of playing with the genre and mixing different styles, matching Deadpool's crazy personality.It is Ryan Reynold's interpretation of Deadpool that is the driving force of the film. Many scenes last quite a while so that we all can get in on his jokes but the rest of the film actually isn't that long. I guess that's the weak spot of it. When we've understood Deadpool as a character and the parody around the genre, there's not that much left to lean on. The British villain's motive to mutate other people and his personal grudge against Deadpool's sassy attitude, eventually gets tiresome. Even Deadpool's jokes are at times childishly foolish and also the brutal violence loses its meant effect after too many decapitated heads. The best thing about the film is actually the short romance between Wade and Vanessa at the beginning. I want to see an entire romantic comedy with just the two of them. However, I don't think that Deadpool should be taken as serious as other superhero films. It is a small and odd contribution to the Marvel family, meant to provoke and take other paths than their big flagships.

"Overrated, childish, boring, raunchy - and not funny.","I don't care about the amount of raunchy jokes and profanity in the movie. I do care that the movie is not funny at all. You can be both raunchy and funny, but this didn't happen in Deadpool.Ryan Reynold's performances are usually laughable, but here it reaches the level of pity. I pity the fact that he accepted to act in such crappy movie. It feels like something a dumb teeanger would watch. A very dumb one.If you don't wanna waste your time, don't watch it. It's definitely not worth it. I guess the overhype around everything about this movie is a circlejerk mess. Definitely the worst movie of 2016.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Campy fun flick - if you can take the blood and gore,"My teenage son encouraged me to watch Deadpool - theoretically an R- rated love story. Wow, what a different kind of film. Self-deprecating, witty, different, funny, all these apply to Deadpool. I guess you could loosely call it a love story. There are some sex scenes, and lots lots of blood and violence.The story constantly pokes fun at Marvel, Ryan, previous flics, future films, but mostly continually at itself. This self-humorous approach, roughly similar to Ant-Man, hits the mark. Deadpool is a pretty cool, innovative story.Ryan plays the role of Wade who eventually becomes Deadpool. The story pokes fun at him over and over, especially around his love for sex and his lover. The editor had a ball with stop action film sequences where Deadpool stops to tell us what is going to happen, pulling himself out of the scene, then diving back in. It works.The movie does slow down a bit in the middle - it was impossible to keep up the non-stop level of witty repartee that introduces the film, starting with the introductory credits - just watch - you'll understand.The end was somewhat predictable, good guy against bad guy. There also is the tie-in with X-men, so I expect that will continue. I understand there's already a Deadpool 2 en route, so buckle up for more fun.I loved Deadpool, and you will too, if you don't mind the blood/violence.

It's time to make the chimi f*cking changas!,"Deadpool is one of my all time favorite heroes so I was waiting for this movie since ages and luckily it turned out great! I've watched it three times in the theaters, I usually never watch a movie so many times in such a short time. This was so fun I just couldn't resist and I had to watch it again and again. It felt like the creators of the movie were also big fans of Deadpool and really enjoyed creating this movie. It is very accurate to the comic version and it's a great movie interpretation. To really enjoy the movie You need know some comics, the 90's and of course movies but there plenty of jokes and easter eggs about all kinds of stuff. The action scenes of the movie were also top notch, brutal and bloody. Also as we are talking about an R rated movie and Deadpool, well we can hear a lot swearing 'it's a different kind of superhero movie'. It's easily one of the best superhero movies and I've enjoyed every seconds of it, would watch it again 10/10. Can't wait for the sequel!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Great comedy, good action.","I don't usually watch comedy movies as they most often fail to achieve their purpose, of making me laugh. Deadpool was a stunning combination of stupid but funny jokes, jokes and the occasional bad jokes. Ryan Reynolds seems to play Deadpool as natural as if he'd written the role himself, while also respecting the comic book character's persona to a high degree. Deadpool is one of the best comedy movies I've ever watched if not the best, and I'd also place it in my top overall movies. The reasons why it's considered unsuited for children and R-rated are pretty obvious, but if you're not planning to see a movie with your kids, it's definitely a title to keep in mind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Super. But no hero.,"Mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) falls in love with escort girl Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin), but soon-after discovers that he has late-stage cancer. When a strange man approaches Wade saying that he can not only cure his disease, but also give him incredible powers, he is sceptical, but eventually undergoes the treatment—a long and agonising process that scars his entire body—unaware that the people conducting the operation intend to use him as a 'weapon for hire'.From the ironic opening credits to the inevitable post-credits sequence, Deadpool is an absolute blast, a side-splittingly funny, hyper-kinetic and incredibly bloodthirsty superhero movie for those fed up with normal superhero movies. This one takes everything expected from the genre and subverts it, creating a deliciously dark adventure in which the lead character, imbued with invincibility, doesn't want to be a hero he simply wants revenge. As Deadpool sets about finding Francis, the man who caused him so much pain and melted his good looks, he takes special delight in countless outrageous acts of extreme violence, pausing to break the fourth wall with witty remarks aimed at the viewer. This 'self-awareness' only adds to the fun.While not 'the best superhero movie ever' as some people claim (that honour still goes to Days of Future Past), it's a very close second. I loved it! 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Deadpool, the first truly postmodern superhero. And it's not a compliment","Back in 2008 when Scarlett Johansson married Ryan Reynolds, who I only knew back then as the sidekick from Blade Trinity, the celebrity gossip sites (another one of my guilty pleasures of that time) praised that guy for having a typical Canadian trait of self-irony. Back then it seemed like a good thing. Now, eight years from then, Ms Johansson is in the past and Mr Reynolds is by no means a sidekick anymore. But the self-irony still remains, and this time it found a fresh, almost gargantuan outlet.The genre of superhero movies is always at risk of catching a disease of repetitiveness and predictability, which is no wonder considering those big manly chins that are constantly pulling you down. So, just like Wade Wilson, at some point it had to start mutating into something fresher and more curious to retain the viewer's attention. It may be a pleasure to watch a superhero, but it's a much bigger pleasure when he is not exactly super, or not exactly a hero. Tobey Maguire might not be Spider-Man that every kid dreamed of becoming one day, but his Spidey was a person we all could relate to, with his own flaws and imperfections. A superperson who's still genuinely human inside.Then it was time for the genre to mutate again, to show that heroing can actually be fun (contrary to Christian Bale and all the X-Men's sullen faces). First it was Kick-Ass, an amazing example of how great it can be to make the protagonist a total amateur. And then, of course, Green Hornet, with Seth Rogen taking the concept of a superhero to a completely hysterically ridiculously awesome level.Well, apparently the world needs a hero again. And since all the big-chinned roles are already taken by the likes of Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth, this time the filmmakers decided to go deeper and produce a completely new type of a superhero - one that takes nothing seriously, himself included.There's no denying that Deadpool is good at being that type of a film. With Reynolds giving us a wisecracker who's both marveling at and deriding himself at the same time, and with the entourage that from the opening credits rams home the idea that no ego will be left inviolable tonight, Deadpool feels like a hot stand-up show but with fists flying, bullets buzzing and swords clashing, all in a single bedazzling whirlwind.However, the first stun only lasts for about a half of the movie, after which you start realizing that Ryan Reynolds indeed got this far not thanks to his superior acting method. The gay jokes wear out, the snarky remarks miss the spot and become annoying, and the shallowness of the sidelines gets so obvious that even the constant breaks of the fourth wall to self-admit it don't make it much better. The only thing that keeps holding you is the villains, who, despite being made of cardboard by design, hold their ground exactly because their typicality is authentic.And that is what's wrong with the postmodern approach. In attempt to bring it further on by parasitizing on the idea that there could be no ""further on"" at all, Deadpool eventually loops and bumps into its own rear. And no matter how Mr Reynolds might enjoy his rear to be bumped into, it doesn't compensate for the lack of heart he brings into this film, which is even comical considering the obvious binding to the theater release on the Valentine's Day, and equally tragic considering that Reynolds can, in fact, pull off decent roles, like the one in Mississippi Grind. Sorry Ryan, but this time watching you was like listening to Barenaked Ladies: the music is good and the vocals are decent, but at some point you simply realize that the lyrics are just whiny and immature, and that spoils all the fun. I only hope that Chris Evans will bring that fun back, because despite the big chin, his Captain America also has an equally big heart.I'd give it 6.5, but since IMDb only deals in whole numbers, let's round it up. For the sake of pioneering at something at least.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Ryan Reynolds ""gets it""","Golf clap for Ryan Reynolds and the team that brought this film together. For all the wrongs in super hero cinema, Deadpool will give you hope that it will be all right. Of course, then 'they' released X-Men: Apocalypse...Deadpool is not the greatest movie ever made. No super hero movie ever will be and Ryan Reynolds likely did not set out to make the greatest movie ever made. But what he did accomplish with Deadpool is something more important to the future of the genre. He has the credibility to trust his instincts and to make super hero films fans want. He is an authority now and the success of Deadpool will reverberate through Hollywood. This will transcend into other genres as well; such as sci-fi and fantasy (Star Wars, I am staring directly at you right now... don't divert your eyes from me I'm going to make this hella awkward for you right now)Reynolds and company captured everything that makes the Deadpool comic loved and successfully transferred it to the big screen. He even corrected long-time failures like Colossus and was able to make a seemingly absurd and obscure character, Nega Sonic Teenage Warhead (did i get that right?), relevant, relatable, likable and memorable. What's more is he did all this while not diverting from the central story with cloddish origin stories or other blockbuster tropes.I don't write reviews but this film left me so happy after years of disappointment with my favorite properties that I was compelled to publish something to show my gratitude. RR, please executive produce every Marvel film from here on out because you get it.Thank you.P.S. Singer and Abrams can eat a d***.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Makes a great case for R-rated comic book movies,"Admittedly, I walked into ""Deadpool"" hoping for little more than just a decent treatment of the character. He's not complicated; he's got Spidey's witty banter (jacked up with vulgarity), Wolverine's healing factor, two guns and a pair of swords. Not complicated. He looks like what you'd find in the margins of some twelve year-old's notebook.And they finally did it. Ryan Reynolds works well as the Merc with a Mouth, fluent in his own language of potty words. What's refreshing about this movie is that it's a love story disguised as a very naughty action movie. The fight scenes (slo-mo notwithstanding) are pretty cool, the sex scenes are funny, and it's somehow a breath of fresh air for those suffering from genre fatigue.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Important Step Forward in Comic Book Movie Genre,"Marvel has gone hard-R before, but never like this. Deadpool is the latest comic book movie and tells the story of Wade Wilson, an ex- mercenary, who is transformed into the wise-cracking, 4th wall- breaking, sword-wielding, revenge-seeking super. hero? Outside of a guy wearing a suit and having superpowers, the comparisons to your traditional comic book movie end there. Deadpool's obscene, violent, and hilarious take on the superhero genre is a thoroughly entertaining, though imperfect, step closer towards reaching the full potential of the comic book movie industry.The success of Deadpool rested almost entirely on the shoulders of Ryan Reynolds. Thankfully, Reynolds is one of the best casting decisions I have ever seen in a comic book movie. Reynolds was born to play Deadpool, and his enthusiasm while playing the role is unmatched. I cannot imagine anyone else pulling off Deadpool, and this is a huge credit to the studio for trusting Reynolds with another chance to play this controversial and explicit comic book character.Deadpool's entire hour and forty minute runtime is filled to the brim with laughs. Dirty jokes, shocking images, and 4th wall breaks are just a few of the many forms Deadpool's laughs take. However, when you have 100 plus minutes of jokes, not every one of them is going to hit. Thankfully, after every miss, the downtime between that and the next funny joke is very minimal. Deadpool definitely goes for quantity over quality when it comes to laughs, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.Deadpool is extremely violent, but all of the violence works in tandem with the character himself and the tone the movie strives for. The film is directed by Tim Miller, and while this is his first feature film, he does a fantastic job of actually showing the gory action in a coherent and enjoyable manner. The punches, gunshots, and slices all have visual impact and are NOT hidden or censored by the use of many cuts or other lazy filmmaking techniques. However, some backgrounds and images that have a deep depth of field appear unfinished, and at times, don't look good at all. I'm not sure if this was from budgetary constraints or a rush to meet the release deadline in post-production, but it was a minor distraction and worth noting.The story in Deadpool ties all the gore and laughs together. The story is a fairly simple revenge tale, but it has some emotional weight to it that gives the movie an element I was not expecting. I cared about the man under the mask and his relationship with his girlfriend, Vanessa. And although this relationship is impossible to relate to (at least I would hope so), you still buy them as a couple, and this gives the movie higher stakes. Another thing I liked about the story is it goes back and forth from the present to Deadpool's origin story, which I thought gave the movie a good sense of pacing.One of my biggest complaints I have with the movie is the villain, Ajax. I'm not super familiar with Deadpool and his comics or who (if anyone) is his main antagonist, but Ajax is a very boring and stereotypical villain. I get that his stern demeanor contrasts with Deadpool's wise-cracking personality and opposites facing off generally makes for an interesting dynamic, but I found him as a buzz kill to all the other awesome things going on around him. His powers are not even interesting either. Just because villains sometimes have a tendency to overshadow the hero, like the Joker overshadowed Batman in The Dark Knight, doesn't mean you have to copout with a villain like Ajax.The highest praise I can give Deadpool, that I can rarely say for others movies, is everyone in front and behind the camera feels like they are having a blast making it and are trying their hardest to give fans and movie lovers a movie that's not only a lot of fun, but also good. I hope this movie does well financially to reinforce the fact you don't have to follow a standard superhero formula in order to satisfy fans, and critics alike. If the subject matter requires it, you can go R-rated and not limit yourself creatively. There have been other R-rated Marvel comic book movies, but Deadpool embraces its R rating like no other and hopefully paves the way for other brilliant and unique places comic book movies could go in the future.If you're easily offended by extreme violence, nudity, etc, skip Deadpool altogether. Everyone else? Get your brown pants/red pants/whatever color pants on, and go support a movie that is unapologetically different from any other movie I have ever seen.If you liked this review, check out my website www.watsonmoviereviews.com to talk movies or read some of my other reviews.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Fast, fun, furious and original","Fast funny and furious, summarizes well the three elements that combined in the right dose make this movie such a success. Fast -- action packed at the right pace. Fun- Humour all over, witty humour, gross humour, cheeky humour, white humour, sexy humour, intellectual humour, smart-ass humour, you name it, it is in there. Furious - violent to the extreme, no concessions to the sensitive stomach, but funny violent if that can be said. The movie also has a great script, great characters, awesome dialogues, spectacular action scenes, amazing staging and production, great tempo, crazy fun credits, a good ending, awesome music (just when it is needed) and the right length. The result is one of those super-hero movies that will delight both super-hero movie fans and people who, like me, aren't usually into the genre or into super-violent movies.Reynolds really shines in his role of Deadpool, because, in a way, his personal humour is that of Deadpool, and the character fits him like a glove. I honestly think that all actors are perfect in their respective roles, really well cast.It is really refreshing finding a super-hero movie that doesn't feel cookie-cuttered, that addresses adults with respect, a movie that feels fresh and modern, that is not only entertaining but well filmed, well acted and well-rounded overall -- a super-hero movie that is actually very good.I'm looking forward to seeing the second installment.

Funniest comic book movie,"Deadpool is a new comic book movie and its the story of how the anti-hero gets his identity and his name, and also how he sets in a path of revenge against Ed Skerin. This has to be the best Marvel comic book movie I've ever seen (its debatable with The avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy). The script is very funny, clever and aware of the mistakes Marvel has done of the past about Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds portraits again Deadpool and does a great job doing so. The love interest with Wade Wilson and Vanessa its handled very well and gives the story some weight because you want Deadpool to succeed, you want him to get his girlfriend. The action is done masterfully well blending CGI with practical effects. T.J Miller was also hilariously funny with a lot of great lines, and Colossus is there because he wants to use Deadpool's powers for good, and he wants Deadpool to join the X-men, so it gives a reason for Deadpool to decide who he really wants to be in the future. The name Wade gives himself its amazingly clever and unexpected. The end credit scene was hilarious and its aware of what marvel has done in the past, as the general audience expects information about the sequel or future installments. The music is very well incorporated, the R rating finally gives the movie freedom of doing what they want, the villain is very hateful, and the first credit scene is gut- bustlingly funny. This has to be the funniest movie I've seen in quite some time. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Better than the garbage Marvel usually throws our way,"Last year I said I hated Avengers Age of Ultron because it was just throwing one-liners at the audience. And yes, Deadpool was one one- liner after another, but Deadpool is different. It has substance where Avengers doesn't. It has a character we've been waiting for so many years.The movie is hilarious. Basically the audience got to laugh almost all the time. I think it's almost useless to say that Deadpool was funny, because we have been able to see that from the trailers and the marketing of this film alone.The story was good. It was very similar to X-Men Origins: Wolverine, to be honest. Wilson gets new powers through experimentation he agreed to, but which turned out to go not as smoothly as previously thought, and then he hunts down the people who did that to him - and of course there's romance. But Deadpool does that story way better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine, mostly because it doesn't ruin any characters and other story lines while doing so. Quite the opposite: Deadpool introduces old familiar characters (Colossus) and some really cool new characters (Negasonic Teenage Warhead), and doesn't ruin them. And in Deadpool Colossus has the right accent, because I don't remember him having any accents in the other movies we saw him. Did he even talk in those? I doubt it.The action scenes were alright. But the thing is, in superhero movies - especially anything related to X-Men - I kind of hope to see a lot of different mutant powers during those fights. Like sure, we might not know who those people are, but the powers are cool. Well, here we had like two villain mutates, and both had pretty boring skills. Of course Negasonic Teenage Warhead - whom I am in love with - pretty much made up for everything else.I love the soundtrack of this movie. Thankfully it's on Spotify!Deadpool is kind of like one of those new wave superhero stuff, like Kick-Ass: incredibly violent and filled with twisted jokes. However, comparing Deadpool to anything else than a superhero movie, it's just decent. And of course I have to compare it to my favourite action movie, compared to which Deadpool is only okay.Deadpool was everything I wanted it to be - it was funny in a lot of different ways, it had enjoyable battle scenes and cool characters. It might not be the best action movie there is, but it definitely beats every Avenger movie there is.

Very overrated.,"This the most smart-ass, smug and arrogant film I have ever seen. It is like an annoying teenager who won't stop shouting and swearing to get your attention before saying ""I don't care what you think"" when you know very well they do care what you think. It wants to seem fresh and clever but panders to it's unpleasant teenage audience by including mediocre violence, a linear Super Hero origin movie plot, limited fourth wall breaks that are not creative and constant swearing. The narrative structure is irritating as it constantly flips back and forth in time which stops you becoming engrossed in the action. The main character is very unlikeable. He comes across as an aged school bully and the other characters are not memorable at all, particularly the bland villain and the protagonist's girlfriend who is a stripper (that's not sexist at all). He only breaks the fourth wall by talking to the audience which so many other films do already and the satire doesn't work as it seems just like the films it's satirising just with more swearing. The only clever joke I recall is the opening credits that I won't spoil if you actually want to watch this film. From then on it is boring, unpleasant rubbish.

DEADPOOL is Almost Everything I'd Hoped it Would Be,"It might sound cliché now because the market is being flooded with the character but Deadpool has been my favorite comic character for a while. I've wanted the Merc with the Mouth to get his own big screen movie for years, thinking Ryan Reynolds would be perfect for the role since his performance in BLADE TRINITY as wisecracking Hannibal King. I was excited for Reynolds to assume the role of Wade Wilson in X- MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE and devastated when the character was mutilated by the studio. I'd come to accept the fact that we'd probably never see a true Deadpool cinema incarnation and, lo and behold, Reynolds and crew come through in 2016. DEADPOOL wasn't just a fun, relatively faithful adaptation of my favorite Marvel character but a much needed break from comic book movie routine with the film's proud embracing of the R-rating and utilization of the Deadpool comic tropes we'd come to expect but assumed studios would nix for being ""too weird"" for general audiences. In an effort to reeducate the unknowing masses, DEADPOOL serves as an origin film, explaining to those unfamiliar how Deadpool came to be horribly scarred, certifiably crazy, and essentially immortal. Wade Wilson (Reynolds) is a mercenary for hire who, shortly after finding his soul mate in equally damaged working girl Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With limited options, he turns to the mysterious Ajax (Ed Skrein) who claims he can heal Wilson of his disease. And an antihero is born.DEADPOOL gets a lot of things right and a few things, well, not so much wrong as poorly handled. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy this movie and I'm psyched at the level of success this little ""comic book movie that couldn't"" has achieved. It was a stroke of luck that the movie ever saw production and the love of audiences to the tune of almost $800 billion in worldwide gross box office all but guarantees we won't have to fight so long to see the continuing adventures. Reynolds is exactly as perfect for the role as we'd all known he would be. He gets the character and truly brings him to life with all the wisecracks, juvenile humor, and bloody violence we'd hoped to see. The costume is fantastic, staying incredibly faithful to the comics and even giving his mask expressive eyes to bring it to life. I also loved the inclusion of T.J. Miller to the cast as Deadpool's buddy Weasel. I've been a fan of Miller for a little while and figured his absurd brand of improvised comedy would be an apt fit in the world of DEADPOOL. The two of them ensure that DEADPOOL is just as much a comedy as it is an action movie, which is exactly as it should be. Deadpool doesn't bring the senses of dread or stoic heroism that comes with the usual X-Men film. In DEADPOOL, our hero puts bullets in brainpans and turns violence into insane performance art.Deadpool is, of course, a character from the X-Men universe and as a result we get a couple of cameos to establish this. As to which X-Men cinematic universe we're rooted in, it confuses even Deadpool himself (""McAvoy or Stewart? These timelines can get so confusing.""), but he's given the chance to fight alongside fan-favorite and criminally-underused Colossus and his current mutant trainee Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). These two act as the straight-edged, voices of reason to Deadpool's fourth-wall-breaking craziness in his search for revenge against Ajax. I loved both of them, especially Negasonic. We don't get much out of her character but her angsty teenage persona sets Deadpool up for some fun punchlines and her explosive powers come in handy during the final battle. Colossus is here to give valuable life lessons to Deadpool in hopes of swaying him to the forces of good. I enjoyed the odd-couple pairing of Colossus and Deadpool but I imagine we'll get better banter in the sequel where the end credits coda promises we'll be introduced togo watch for yourself. No spoilers here but it should be obvious to fans. Meanwhile, Colossus serves the role well even if he is comically preachy in his heroic speeches. I love that we finally get an accurate on-screen portrayal (huge, muscular, and Russian) but the CG wasn't always the greatest. It's easily forgiven, and still pretty impressive, considering the limited budget. It makes one hopeful we'll get to see Deadpool's unique brand of crazy interact with other X-Men in future installments.DEADPOOL isn't without its flaws. The plot is disappointingly simplistic. It's your average origin tale intermixed with a revenge plot, but at least it uses nonlinear storytelling to break it up a bit. Most of the origin element is given through flashbacks over the course of a freeway chase/battle that fills the first hour or so of the movie. Plus everyone beside Deadpool is relegated to two-dimensional characters who only exist to serve a plot purpose. Ajax, Vanessa, Weasel, and especially Ajax's second-in- command Angel Dust (Gina Carano) are pretty thin characters. DEADPOOL is pretty much a one-man show with the Merc with the Mouth taking center-stage and everyone else taking a backseat to his showboating. It's fine though. It's fun. And pretty violent so, you know, leave the kids home for this one. As Deadpool would tell you, he's the best there is at whatever Wolverine does. Wolverine never quite got to cut loose in the X-Men films to the extent Deadpool does here and, superhero or not, this is not a family film. The R-rating should've been a dead giveaway but I'm amazed at how I saw kids at my first screening. In short, DEADPOOL is a comic book movie for people who are tired of comic book movies, while still stumbling into same pitfalls of franchise-opening comic book movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Excellent super anti-hero movie,"Hm why did I like it so much? First of all I liked it so much because it was a different kind of super hero movie compared to the others I have seen.I liked it so much because I was more interested in the crazy funny scenes and words that came out of Deadpool's & W. Wilson's mouth than in the plot & story of the movie. Or in other words, I went to the movie to laugh and didn't expect an amazing plot. And, I didn't get disappointed.I loved how they made fun about a lot of other superhero movies. Surely, not every joke belonged to my kind of humor, but some jokes & scenes were just done brilliantly & funny.If you do not take this movie's story, plot, and maybe some jokes too seriously than you will definitely like it. But the plot isn't that bad, better than a lot of other super hero movies I have seen.I've read that some people are complaining that there is nudity and a sex scene in this movie... So? Come on people we are living in the 21. Century where almost everyone has access to the internet and not in the middle ages...! While I was watching the movie there was never a second where I felt bored. You always wanted to know what Deadpool/ Wade was going to do or say next.Ryan R. and the rest of the cast did a great job, Ryan is definitely billion times better in portraying Deadpool than the other super hero with the green suit :).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Gun Fetishist's Wet Dream,"""Deadpool"" was billed as a superhero movie for adults. I was skeptical about that claim, because I'm still not convinced that those two terms aren't mutually exclusive. I've seen it now, and as near as I can tell, ""adult"" really means that it's got a dirtier mouth and more graphic violence, which makes me despair a bit about the state of adulthood in America. But I will say that I enjoyed it much more than any superhero movie in recent memory, because it's actually funny and doesn't take itself seriously. But that's also fairly faint praise, because I've pretty much given up on superhero movies and can't even remember the last one I saw.Ryan Reynolds can be very funny, but he can also be very annoying, and he's about equal parts both in this film. The movie has a potty mouth that is mostly used to clever and witty effect, and some gratuitous nudity is always a-OK with me. But what kept me from really enjoying this film was the casual violence, much of it played for laughs. I guess this is where the ""adult"" thing comes in, because I just can't find myself enjoying the gun fetishism in a movie like this. The actual gun problems in the real world are too immediate and too concerning to me to be able to relax into the fantasy of a movie like this, and my stomach curdles at the thought of the whooping and hollering that I have no doubt went on in audiences of this film as the bullets and the blood flew.And though there was talk, however brief, about this film actually getting some Oscar attention, that talk was ridiculous. Nothing about this movie was that good.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Epic r rated marvel movie.,"Thanks to fox bringing marvel's mercenary with the mouth to life and got him right after x-men origins wolverine. Ryan Reynolds is amazing as Deadpool, he acts like he always want to be a marvel superhero. The fourth wall breaks are hilarious as well as Deadpool interacts with the audience. It's like he's actually talking to us during the movie. The rest of the movie is just amazing with its incredible action sequences, funny pop culture references, and what the Deadpool comics are all about. The villain nothing new though. He's like this mad Doctor who wants to Make experiments on people but i will give him credit that he can do some awesome fights with wade. This movie is just one heck of a thrill ride of awesome Visuals, descent fight scenes and some pop culture references and fourth wall breaking to make every Deadpool fan exited.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Deadfooling around to a super hit,"A superhero with God like powers of immortality added with a wicked sense of humor. Yes that is our R rated superhero who saves the day after you have movies like Iron man 2 and Wolverine. He is the laughing ninja who has a bad joke for every occasion which will make you laugh hard. And yes he directly speaks to his fans without giving a sh#% to the script or to the director screaming a cut. ""Who cares we have our own movie and we will rock it"" is the sole mantra of this red spanks and no cape awesomeness.The story is not very complicated and basically can be summarized in few sentences. The plot is OK for the introductory movie of this new superhero but the action and the comedy is the actual spice in this curry. It will keep you laughing and entertained, Nopes there is no social message in this movie and you don,t need one. The Director whoever he is has done an awesome work by keeping it less complicated and filled with fun. This can be really entertaining if you have a good sense of humor or even if you don,t have one.

Deadpool arrives on the big screen!  Again...,"Most fans would rather forget the character's first film appearance, but it was that appearance that did lead to this film. So while the character did not really get fleshed out all that much at the beginning of X-men Origins: Wolverine nor was he portrayed correctly at the end, the end result is one of the funniest movies I have seen at the theaters in many years. Truth be told though, I am not really big on comedies for the most part. Still, this film was a great spectacle to behold and it is nice seeing Ryan Reynold's film really take off. Not only because I always enjoy seeing him in films, but also because he made a comic book movie the right way, something Hollywood seems to scared to do. He made a comic book film where the character acts like he does in the comic, looks like he does in the comic and it has not been made for the general audience. No, we get Deadpool in all his crazed glory, doing what he does best...killing! When he is not killing, he is constantly breaking the fourth wall as Deadpool knows he is a comic book character and Reynold's portrays the crazed 'hero' with magnificent glee!The story, well that is simple. Deadpool wants to kill someone! Why? Well, through a series of flashbacks we learn of the way the merc with a mouth has become the way he is and a love that is lost to him. To not only fix his deformed face, but to also get revenge he must find a guy named Ajax, who is actually named Francis. Deadpool will get help in the form of the mighty Colossus and his teenage protégé. He also has allies in a man who runs a bar that deals with problems, a cab driver who does not seem to mind getting paid in high fives and a blind roommate who enjoys cocaine. Yes, all the typical things one tends to find in comic book movies...not! Did I mention boobs? Yep, they're in there too! So Deadpool must go find the ones who wronged him and do some slicing and dicing too!I am very happy with the film's success; unfortunately, I do believe that Hollywood will get the wrong idea by the results. They are going to just assume that making every comic book film with a slightly edgy character should contain gratuitous violence and nudity and all that when the real reason the film is doing well is the fact it was made for those of us who enjoy reading comics. Too often they soften up a character and completely change things to suit a wider audience, but this film proves that is not necessary. The characters have been portrayed a certain way and I find it insulting when those of us who read comics get dismissed and things added to other comic book films to attract say more female viewers. Seriously, did having Bruce Banner and the Black Widow have a thing really work? Never happened in the comics and this is just one example in one of the more recent comic book movies. Just look at Colossus in this movie. He finally has a Russian accent and he has a better fight scene here than he did in any of the X-men movies. This movie proves you can do things by the book and the film will do good, but the lesson they will learn is just to make everything R.So, I enjoyed this film immensely. Had it opened last year it would have trailed only Mad Max: Fury Road as my favorite film of 2015. My only problems with the film are the fact I thought they showed a bit too much back story in how he became who he was as the film did have a bit of a romantic subplot going itself. Still, in the end it was about shooting and killing and learning that if you are going to be killing and bleeding a lot to make your costume red. This film took awhile to finally get off the ground and I am glad Ryan Reynolds did not give up as he made a very funny comic book film on a rather small budget by today's standards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Completely off the chain - one of my favourite superhero movies ever,"This movie is completely mad. Thanks to the brilliantly funny, no- holds-barred brand of comedy that is absolutely everywhere from start to finish, Deadpool is a consistently hilarious comedy, made even better by a very well-written plot, excellent performances, and amazingly-directed action.Deadpool is a movie made first and foremost for the fans. In comic book lore, he's the ultimate foul-mouthed, wise-cracking rogue superhero, and the movie takes that character and places him on screen in exactly the same form. Therefore, rather than the more family-friendly, action-oriented superhero movies that dominate the box office nowadays, prepare for something completely different.Although the story and action are great, and I'll talk about that in a second, it's the humour that's the real stand-out of this movie. There's so much bad language, and so much adult humour, but in this movie, it works like magic.I didn't think Deadpool was the funniest movie ever, but I was laughing on a consistent basis right the way through this movie. The shock value of the swearing, extreme violence, self-referential humour and countless fourth wall breaks didn't wear off at all, which is testament to just how brilliant a script this film has. Even if you're not into the world of superheroes, Deadpool can still be a fantastically enjoyable movie just because it's so funny.That leads me into talking about Ryan Reynolds, who was amazing in the lead role. He pulls off the chatterbox superhero so well, delivering on the comedic front time and time again, whilst also managing to make a character that really won't shut up hugely likable, which again meant that you could keep enjoying the mad comedy right up to the end of the film, because everything that came out of Deadpool's mouth was just hilarious.But don't think that this is just a comedy, because it does shine on the story and action front too. Whilst tying into the X-Men Universe, Deadpool is a very unique superhero movie. It's not all about saving the world, it's just a story of a guy who wants to get revenge on a man who completely ruined his life. And because of that, you can actually relate to this guy more so than any other big blockbuster superhero because his determination is so simple and real.As well as being a revenge story, Deadpool is also a bit of a love story. It's the revenge that drives the film, but the relationship between Wade Wilson and his old girlfriend is a genuinely believable one (helped by the fact that Reynolds and Morena Baccarin work so well together), and is yet another brilliantly-written plot point that allows you to get more invested in what is a hugely entertaining film.Finally, let's talk about Tim Miller's directing. Despite being his feature debut, Miller has done an absolutely stunning job with Deadpool. Whilst the comedy is the driving force, one of my main takeaways from the film was how brilliant the action was. There could definitely have been less CGI, but when we see Deadpool either in gunfights or hand-to-hand combat, it's thrilling to watch, getting better and better until the excellent final act, which I absolutely loved, making this one of my favourite superhero movies ever.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
it was okay,"I didn't really find it funny, the humor seemed very gimmicky after a while since a lot of the jokes are 4th wall bending. I didn't find it really that clever. They put Deadpool through a lot in this movie and they like to show his pain because I guess that would make the audience feel sympathetic towards our main character. However it doesn't really feel uncomfortable for the viewer at any point. I would've liked it if they added some actual anguish, and not just Deadpool saying ""this is terrible but I joke about it"".Facing losing your life to cancer is hard enough in itself. I felt like the film tried to get it more powerful and effective by piling more and more things on to their character, but it's really how the characters react to a certain situation, not the severity of the situation itself. For the character they built and the amount of tragedy there supposedly is, there is really not that much emotional reaction that they are able to actually get out. It doesn't go very deep into the world that they are in either, I didn't really get a fullness feeling out of it, so fourth wall breaks don't feel very outrageous at all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Deadpool Review by Deadpool himself: Breaking the fourth wall!,"You saw a bullet create a hole on my body in those trailers, though Indian censor had some culture supporting cuts, my movie is worth watching. Oh wait, you may be wondering why the Deadpool narrative review, that's because reviewers don't make me bleed! What do they usually start a review with? The storyline right, my movie doesn't have a great story to deal with; like those Marvel films, yes the Wolverine film, I hunt the ones who gave me super powers and get back my girl –but stop, I got a better love story here, Indian audience won't get to feel the 'love' completely. The plot isn't that twisting or philosophical uh...oh, I saw some of them complaining my lukewarm plot, were you expecting Nolan or what? You can actually relate my film to Guardians of the Galaxy, well, the whole pack wasn't as abusive as me indeed, but the fun factor resonates. May be, I could have coffee with those guys in some crossover film.Yeah, I know that you all saw my Red band trailer, so you might've got an idea of what kinda superhero I'm- I'm of the rambunctious sort, thanks to my creators they have allowed me break the fourth wall and even re generate my body parts. I know that this thing interested you guys, you wanna see blood spurt in slow motion and the sharp blade take a full view on the screen, don't worry, though debutant, Tim Miller has packed stuff to keep you guys appealing, but nerds stay away. I'm not the type of superhero who protects the city; I'm neither a watchful guardian, nor a genius, billionaire, whatever. When you step into theaters, right from the opening credits, you stay entertained, even after the end credits. That's more important for me, when you get to see a sarcastic anti-hero like me, which is what matters more. I troll almost everyone I know, right from all those superheroes to that once-failed super hero guy, Ryan Reynolds. Uh oh, time to enter performance side, this guy is the show stealer of my film, he portrayed me in the most lovable manner, thanks man – hope you guys are reading this in his voice! Without his narration, my film wouldn't have been so effective, well, this role will patch is career. So cool he was. Ed Skrein too did his part well, he was sleek, and so were the ones who did the supportive mutants. Morenna Baccarin was sexy while TJ Miller had a couple of extra scenes than what you have seen in all the trailers combined. I did even spot Marvel's chairman, maybe he was being cautious of me breaking the fourth wall.At the making part, as I've already said, Miller packed things together to make my movie as engaging and entertaining as possible, you won't feel even the slightest trace of bore. The action sequences are of top class, they appeal both visually and violently. Another factor that pumps energy is the music by Junkie XL, I know most of you've fallen in love with 'X Gon Give it to Ya', I saw the theater go crazy when I walked in slow motion for that song. Is there anything remaining to mention? Yes, editing was crisp with those sharp cuts and the film is technically brilliant.You guys are still reading this? Aah, got it, the tail piece right? These days people make a statistical analysis of money spent on watching the film, I'm not gonna do that! If you wanna really see the different kinda superhero, I mean, anti-hero, go get your tickets, don't gather reasons to watch the torrent print. Though Indian censor tried to make me cultural, I'm still entertaining cause I'm Dead-f**king-pool! I hired this Sooraj Pattazhy to write this review as he was watching the film while I was slicing the baddies! I promised him that my fans are gonna shower this post with likes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Spunking,"Marvel has repeatedly toyed with ways to riff on their overblown antics. They had Ant Man last year where he shrunk and all that and the all important fight to save the world took place among toys. They had Tony Stark in the last Iron Man as screwy actor struggling with superhero machinery that blew up in his face. The first Thor of course, with the savior hero washing down in 'real life' from his astral world above and shown to be a big jock.That's what they do here, a superhero narrator plowing his way through the superhero plot while commenting on the absurdity of tropes. It's mostly matter of engineering gags from that point. He's hideous looking, rides to the big showdown in a taxi. He has only 12 bullets, misses a few times in close range then gets a miraculous shot. He's only incidentally fighting against evil and would rather chew his own hand out of a bear trap than join the goody-two-shoe X-Men. He's basically this snarky dude who was plopped inside a Marvel movie and is fighting his way out of being a superhero (but meanwhile enjoys the mischief possible with playing the part).Far from novel but they decided to keep the kids out this time so we have a bit of personality, a stoner imagination. His flatmate slash sidekick is an old lady and they get to toke together. Unlike an Avengers Walmart, you don't get the sense that it's corporate wash aimed at everyone and no one in particular.My favorite bit was probably the relationship with the girlfriend. Love as unabashedly chasing each other outside norms. It's not as easy to seduce that twinkle in the eye out of actors as it looks.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The Deadpool movie you've been waiting for!,"I had high expectations for this, the trailers looked awesome, and it was R rated! When was the last time a good comic book movie was R rated? (Answer: 2012's excellent Dredd). Ryan Reynolds gets to redeem himself after the disappointing Deadpool-in-name-only from 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, although nobody blames Reynolds himself for that, as it was clearly the writers and studio. Instead with this film we get the Deadpool we always wanted: fourth-wall breaking, constant quipping and the aforementioned R rated violence. Reynolds is perfect in the role, banishing memories of Green Lanterns and mouth-sewn-shut mercs of the past. One a side note, I much prefer this Colossus to the one in previous X-Men films. Stefan Kapicic provides the voice for the motion-captured X-Man and he really nails the character. Brianna Hildebrand as ""Negasonic Teenage Warhead"" was lots of fun too. Add to that a fantastic soundtrack and one kick ass final action scene, and this is one hell of a good time. After the non-event comic book movies of 2015, we've got our first winner out of the gate for 2016, and in a year where we'll see not one but two films with heavyweight superhero smackdowns, this one may have already beaten both already. I'm going back to see it it at least twice more.

The funny lines of Deadpool are what makes this a very enjoyable movie to watch. I heard from others it was completely different then the usual X-Men movies and I have to agree with that. It's totally refreshing. The cast is well chosen and are perfect in their characters. It's the first time I actually can't wait to have a sequel for a super hero movie.

I disappointed her and the movie disappointed me. Instead of watching 'The Revenent' I made the bad choice of not wanting to wait until I can see Deadpool later. I regret it a bit.I am not saying it was a total failure but I think they could have made it a lot funnier with a real story ( not the story about his girlfriend).

All the effects are awesome, and it feels like this movie had a much higher budget than it did. The director knew what he was doing.Comedy - This movie is hilarious. Not a single joke falls flat. A lot of the comedy is fairly violence-based and profane. If you don't like that for some reason, then don't watch it. This movie has pretty much everything that could qualify it for an R rating in it.Plot - Though there are a few cliches featured in this movie (mostly for comedic purposes) this movie is pretty original. Not a lot of movies tell their stories in this manner. If you're interested in watching a boring conventional superhero story, look elsewhere.Cinematography - Looks awesome. Everything is well-shot.

"""Cabin in the Woods"" of Superhero Movies","""Deadpool"" joyfully and audaciously pokes fun at other superhero flicks while being one in itself. The film's rapid-fire humor, self referential gags, and ballsiness satirize not only superhero movie clichés but also movie clichés as well. Yet what holds it back from greatness is its superficially structured story, unimpressive CGI action, ineffective resonance and bland one-dimensional characters excluding the titular character.""Deadpool"" tries desperately to stand out, and to not be seen as just another superhero movie. Well outside of the self referential humor, pop culture references, and the always funny Deadpool, the film becomes exactly what it is so afraid of being labeled as: just another over-the-top, oversaturated, and superficial action extravaganza. The only thing that saved ""Deadpool"" from being another mediocre excursion into the marvel canon was its non-stop jokes and compelling freedom to do whatever it wanted.""Deadpool"" could have been great if the writers put the same amount of time, effort, and creativity into the plot, and characters as they put into their jokes. The characters were just same old same old clichés particularly the forgettable villain. The character motivations behind Deadpool getting revenge were silly and almost absurd. Like seriously, he signed up for what happened to him. Also the movie does not suffer from the occasional 'save the world' plot, but maybe just as unoriginal, it suffers from the 'save the girl, kill the bad guy' plot. The worst sin of all is that even though the movie pokes fun at these clichés, it still ends up being guilty of them.With all this said ""Deadpool"" is still an enjoyably funny fast pace superhero flick that most will like for its new and refreshing humor.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

R rated fun and all,"Never mind all the fuss about the movie being unsuitable for kids. Parents would be very stupid if they generalize all movies with costumed characters in them as movies suitable for kids. Deadpool finally received justice in treatment for a movie. This movie kept it staying true to the character's whole aspects; the fourth wall breaking, the smart mouth, the crazy comedies, and all the nicely flowed action. Though it seems that the studio put some distance to the wider X-Men franchise by only showing the group's name and references without any cameo from the previous movies, Deadpool in itself has already been a great fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Horrible,"This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It is nothing but language and gratuity, with very little worth watching. Yes, it was a good plot and I enjoyed it, but the senseless language and sex put into it ruined it for me. If Marvel does this to another movie I may very well stop following Marvel movies altogether. Also if I could rate this lower than 1 I would do so. This is completely unsuitable for any movie, and as Marvel movies have been geared mostly for family viewing this is entirely unsuitable. It would be like Walt Disney producing cartoon pornography - just wrong. Save your money and your brain cells - this is not worth the time it would take to steal it, let alone pay for it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Funny, bloody and entertaining superhero movie.","Deadpool is the new superhero movie starring Ryan Reynolds. Well, it's not new anymore. The movie came out 5 years ago, and I didn't see the movie because I didn't expect it to be good. Do you remember Green Lantern? Yep, that's why!I watched the movie because my brother forced me. I agreed on the terms, and it was more fun than I'd really expected. I've already watched the movie 3 times, and watched the sequel even more times. I actually likes the sequel a little bit more. There's several reasons why. It's a little bit funnier, arguably more violent, and not as vulgar as the first one. This movie is also hilariously violent and funny. This is one of the funniest superhero movies I've seen, and should be watched by every adult superhero fan.Ryan Reynolds is perfect as Deadpool. He does the movie a complete comedy, and breaks the 4th wall several times. He even jokes about it. He even jokes about himself. There's references to Green Lantern, Wolverine, X-Men, Professor X, and Ryan Reynolds. It makes everything so fun to watch. Even Ed Skrein is perfection as Ajax, the british supervillain who ruined Wade's life.I know I've sad that Deadpool 2's better, but one thing this movie does better, is the storytelling. It begins in a violent action scene where Deadpool kills a bunch of men. And so, it jumps back two years before this, and tells his happy life until he gets cancer and takes the opportunity to get a cure. Well, it ruined his life.This is with no doubt a highly recommended superhero movie if you want to have some fun. Well, this movie gives you an overload of fun. The only bad thing in this movie is that there is some serious and emotional scenes in the movie, as well. It completely blocks some of the dark humour that ends the scene. These scenes didn't have to be in this movie, or at least they could have made it shorter. Another bad thing in the movie is that it has some moments where you just want to see action without humour. But there is humour in every action scene. You may don't want to laugh, but you do it anyway. That's kinda irritating. Besides from that, almost everything that's meant to be funny is funny. You should definitely give this movie (and the sequel) a chance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A Cesspit of Actual Filth for Children direct from Disney Corps!,"This flick had some pretty funny dialogue, penis and poopoo humor, action and heart. A smart mouthed former military mercenary with an attractive girlfriend gets bad news, and tries to change his fate. A organization tracks this guy down offering him promises. Lot's of violence, and halfway through the movie God was cursed, and the rating got dropped! Good story line, and the effects were all right. Other than the swearing my only other disappointment, was too much stinky and defecation jokes that started to wear a little thin, after a while. This is a movie that a modern day Sodom and Gomorrah would be proud of. I've lost my respect for Marvel and I've lost my respect for Disney.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Refreshingly filthy superhero movie that is bound by its origin-story trappings,"It is evident for around 5 minutes of Gavin Hood's disastrous X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) that Fox were onto something with their casting of Ryan Reynolds as the gobby mercenary Wade Wilson aka Deadpool. That was until he had his mouth sown together and turned into a super weapon before he could resemble anything like the character who had garnered a legion of loyal readers in Marvel's comic-book world. Talks of a reboot were in the air even since, and despite Reynolds' public support of the movie and obvious fan anticipation, it felt like it would never happen.With Fox now piecing their beloved and highly lucrative franchise back together following Days of Future Past's re-setting of the timeline (deleting Hood's movie and Brett Ratner atrocious X-Men: The Last Stand in the process), the 'Merc with a Mouth' finally arrived to glowing reviews, fan adoration, and a box-office taking that was beyond anyone's expectations. The early trailers teased that the character would be at his foul-mouthed, sarcastic best, and although Deadpool is set firmly within the same universe as Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, it certainly doesn't follow the same rules.Deadpool is all about Deadpool, and so the plot can be summed up within the same sentence. The climax essentially plays out throughout the entire movie, with Ryan Reynolds' already-suited-up hero ambushing a gang of bad guys on a freeway and taking them out in various gruesome ways. We flash back to his time working as muscle-for-hire in New York, where he meets escort Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) at a bar and the two fall in love. Wade soon learns he has aggressive cancer, and, without Vanessa's knowledge, volunteers for an experimental treatment that he soon learns consists of torture at the hands of Ajax (Ed Skrein), who hopes to awaken latent mutant genes in his subjects. He escapes the lab with the ability to heal but permanently disfigured, with a plan to take revenge and win back Vanessa.A lot of Deadpool's success has been put down to its R rating, and the film certainly flaunts its freedom to make dick jokes and kill its characters in a variety of gruesome ways. While this may be the case to some degree, it seems that people forget Deadpool is, most importantly, offering something different in an already-overcrowded superhero market. While the filthy sense of humour does grate at times, especially whenever Wade's friend Weasel (T.J. Miller) is on screen, Deadpool is anything but the traditional brooding superhero with the weight of the world on their shoulders, he is selfish and self- absorbed yet motivated by his love for Vanessa, repeatedly breaking the fourth wall and informing us that he is fully aware of his role in the movie. When he is dragged by X-Men Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) to Professor X's mansion, he wonders whether it will be Patrick Stewart or James McAvoy awaiting him.But the low-key approach, although refreshing, also shrinks the movie. The fragmented narrative offers a slightly new take on the origin movie, but take this away and the film still falls into the same genre trappings. There's the love interest, the life-changing experiment, the forgettable bad guy - all tropes covered in a hundred films before it. So without an enticing plot to sink the teeth into, a lot falls on the charisma of Reynolds as a character intended to provoke a strong reaction. Thankfully, Reynolds gives his best performance, a role worthy of his natural screen presence and slightly idiosyncratic delivery. Whether the humour is for you or not (it certainly made me laugh out loud throughout), you have to admire director Tim Miller's belief in such a risky project, and it will hopefully open the gates to the possibility of more adult superhero movies in a genre always in need of fresh input.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Ryan is one hell of an actor.,"Without Ryan Reynolds, this movie would not be what it is today. Yes, the Deadpool character from the comics is already a cult legend, but still, there is not a single actor who could outperform Ryan in this role. The fact that he is the same kind of a cool guy in his private life gives the extra taste of dedication to the role he was given. The references to other movies and to himself were also very entertaining, altho I think that maybe just a bit less nudity would be more appropriate, but still. this is Deadpool and that is what he does.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Enjoyable Experience,"Deadpool is a unique nut ultimately flawed movie. It's a nice middle finger to the standard superhero genre, but, other than that, it does not have much substance.Don't get me wrong. I like the jokes. I like the gore and the meta humor. But I also want an engaging story. The whole film is your run of the mill, average story with some engaging sequences. The effects haven't aged well, but that's excusable with the budget it has. The side characters and the opening title sequence are pretty subversive, and so is the end credits scene.But if the only thing holding up the movie is the comedy and the R rating, then that's not enough. This film tries to make fun of superhero tropes and use them as well. You can't have keep your cake but also try to eat it. Either be a generic film or be a complete subversion of the genre.The first action sequence at the beginning is by far the best one. In fact, every action sequence after it is kind of a letdown comparatively. The villain was pretty weak, but serviceable.I don't hate this movie, I just feel like it's wasted potential. They could have done a lot more than this. I am still glad that this movie made a lot of money, and I'm glad it had a large impact. I hope that, as time goes on, we get more super-hero movies that are rated R and try something that hasn't been done before. I hope more studios will be confident enough to give filmmakers more freedom to tell unique stories. At the end of the day, I'm more glad of the impact this film had rather than the film itself",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"OK movie, not the best.","OK so i went into this movie knowing that it was going to be very immature and dirty, and i left the theater not laughing as much as i wanted to. If you are a person who loves sexual humor (i don't) you will enjoy this movie a lot more then most people. Not going to say that there isn't other type of humor, but it is mostly is sexual. The story was very predictable, there was no big turns or plot changes. In my own opinion i left the theater liking Colossus more then DeadPool. The action in the movie and the special effects and the fight scenes were on point. They were very fun to watch and enjoy and sometimes left you cringing at the amount of gore and blood. So to sum up why i gave it a 6 out of 10, well it gets the 6 points for being good in action scenes and special effects. They seemed very realistic and made a good watch like a super hero movie should be. I did not give the 4 extra points because it was to predictable, the script was cheesy at times, sometimes it lacked a bit of seriousness when there should of been. Also, this is a superhero movie, which means it should of been available for all ages. Now i cant bring this movie home and have my family watch it. I hope in the second one they tone it down. Also if they could make a clean DVD version would be nice. That way children could watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Demands your money and rewards your obedience with a nearly two hour cacophony of violence, language, and debauchery","Even if you downright despise Tim Miller's ""Deadpool,"" Marvel's R-rated, vulgar and violent superhero film, you almost have to admire the lengths to which this film was marketed. ""Deadpool""'s colorful and eclectic marketing campaigns, which featured interactive theater standees, a multitude of different posters and banners with tongue-in-cheek lines, bold and self- referential Television spots, professional interviews with the cast in character, and a release over Valentine's Day weekend to further its lack of boundaries, is among one of the best of the new decade in terms of getting people excited about what was predicted by many to be a tough film to market.The fact of the matter is something like ""Deadpool"" is what the Marvel brand needs. Even amongst superhero fans, the recent influx and market-saturation of heroes getting their first origins story on film or sequels furthering another hero's saga, the genre is breeding familiarity and contempt at the same time (I've spoken about this on a personal level many times). Superhero films often bear a PG-13 rating for strong violence, sporadic language, and sexual innuendos. Meanwhile, here's a film of the genre that earns its R-rating like most Judd Apatow comedies do; comparatively, with all the four-letter words tossed around like sentence articles, it would the events on Saturday night at a city bar look worthy of a PG-13 rating. Finally, its bloody, often wince-inducing violence reminds us that, even in the modern day, superhero films aren't nearly as rough and ugly as they could be. The film is less Marvel's red-headed step- child amongst superheroes than it is an unearthly, oversized meteor that has just crashlanded in a multiplex near you, demanding your money and attention for nearly two hours in return for some of the most cacophonous violence, language, and debauchery you're likely to see from a mainstream film all year.The film revolves around Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), a mercenary who now spends his days in New York City protecting teenage girls from stalkers and ex-boyfriends by working for a company that specializes in taunting and assaulting them. Wade winds up becoming romantically entangled with a prostitute named Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin) with plans to marry her until he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. As a response, he leaves Vanessa and undergoes an underground procedure to kill his cancer, only to be injected with a serum that leaves him horribly disfigured. Upon escaping from Francis Freeman's (Ed Skrein), the man who has surgically altered him and his body, Wade learns that he now has the ability to rapidly heal, as well as maneuver and contort his body in inhuman ways.In effort to mask his horrid appearance, Wade ""squeezes his ass"" into red and black spandex, attaches two machetes to his back, protects himself with an endless supply of guns and ammo, and becomes the violent and unpredictable Deadpool. He plans on taking out Francis for ruining his physical appearance, rescue his girlfriend from her captivity by Francis, and continue to assure both Colossus (Stefan Kapičić) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead's (Brianna Hildebrand), two individuals that are part of X-Men, that he doesn't need to join X-Men in order to become a more competent, proved superhero.""Deadpool""'s approach to humor is much like that of ""Dirty Grandpa""'s, a film I saw about two weeks ago that has already faded from the minds of most consumers; it's a film that throws numerous lines, jokes, and concepts at a wall in order to see what sticks. Throughout the course of this film, Reynolds' Deadpool probably has a good one-hundred and fifty lines rooted in jokes, and while less than half produce a laugh, they help articulate that this is a character none of us have really seen before. Deadpool's unapologetic lack of political incorrectness is what makes him such a monumental, albeit exhausting, presence. His unwillingness to cater to the tendencies of the mainstream or the ordinary are precisely why we watch superhero films in the first place; it's only recently that we, along with the core themes of the films, have lost sight of this in favor of quantity over quality.The consistent pestering of Deadpool by Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead works to illustrate a nice metaphor of how Deadpool's inception on-screen came to be. Some studio executives probably wanted to neuter or clean up his attitude and story to make him a more marketable character rather than an outspoken anti- hero; perhaps make him a dark, but not too dark, X-Men character that at least had some semblance of discipline. Through Reynolds', Miller's, and screenwriters Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese's respect and loyalty to the character and his brand, they've created a film that will satisfy, or at least entertain, almost all who choose to see it. While its humor is a bit infrequent, its ability to entertain is quite prolific, merging meaningful drama with raunchy comedy and gratuitous bloodshed to create the Quentin Tarantino of superhero films from the ground up.Marvel needed a superhero that the wearying audience could look unto and smile and through the fourth-wall breaking, crude and careless, unapologetically ruthless Deadpool, they've crafted a hero that is worthy of your attention.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"A barrage of hilarity, profanity and gore kept in check by a strong script","A superhero movie has never been funnier than ""Deadpool."" Or more outlandish – or obscene. That should come as quite a relief to fans of Marvel Comics' foul-mouthed anti-hero and especially Ryan Reynolds, who labored a long time to get Deadpool's his own solo adventure on the big screen, a process that entailed – according to Deadpool, at least – fondling 20th Century Fox's prized asset whose name ""rhymes with Pullverine.""Reynolds and Deadpool are truly the perfect actor-character marriage they've long purported to be. The showy, insult-driven and vulgar humor of the part recalls the ""Van Wilder"" days that launched Reynolds to stardom, and even though audiences are familiar with his shtick, there's a whole other degree of wit applied to make ""Deadpool"" funny in an original way.But ""Deadpool"" would be nothing but a crass cult film if it weren't for strong bones from Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick's script holding it together and giving the humor (and the entire movie, frankly) purpose. The ""Zombieland"" duo builds a clever and engaging story structure that serves as both effective origin story and a big showcase for Reynolds and the film's panache-heavy approach.First-time director Tim Miller succeeds with the flair, which is saying something given how clear it is that the visual effects budget for this one isn't as high as it is for your typical superhero film, but the film is a little bumpy and chaotic at times, visually at least. Action, however, is not the film's primary export, so much as cartoonish gore and comedy-driven sequences.Yet the wit is where ""Deadpool"" really exceeds expectation. Fourth wall-breaking humor (and jokes about breaking the fourth wall) is a hallmark of the Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza comic and the script really uses this technique appropriately, along with a litany of self-aware meta-humor that will elicit chuckles from superhero movies fans, from references to Hugh Jackman to jabs at Reynolds' previous superhero failures. These jokes help keep the barrage of foul- mouthed humor from feeling too grating, though with any comedy that goes for the quantity approach, it has noticeable misfires.You should know if you're into movies like ""Deadpool"" before you even set foot in a theater, and if you are, your expectations will likely be met. If you're not as into the genre, you still might be surprised. Either way you're likely to laugh harder than you ever have watching heroes in spandex, and that includes ""Kick-Ass.""""Deadpool"" doesn't succeed in all phases, but you'll be surprised at the level of investment you feel in the story and the outcome thanks to the Reese and Wernick. That's not an easy feat for a film that also knows it can't take itself too seriously either. ""Deadpool"" finds that balance just long enough to hold the viewer through its more than reasonable runtime and deliver an enjoyable rump (sic) at the movies.~Steven CThanks for reading!

A super hero with a bad mouth,"When a Deadpool movie was first announced, it sent the fans into a frenzy but things were little pessimistic considering the content would be too mature and too ugly for a comic book super hero and a possible R rating could actually be cutting off a large section of the target audience, this resulted in a development hell for over 10 years.Finally the reins were transferred to Tim Miller and Ryan Reynolds was roped in to play the eponymous role. Deadpool was the first of its kind superhero who comes in with an inbuilt sarcasm trigger and knows how to use his superpowers both selfishly and irresponsibly. Well! You can say therein lies the charm of it all.Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a kind of mercenary who helps teenage girls get rid of their stalkers. He runs into Vanessa Carlysle (Moreanna Bacairn) an escort and they both hit it off instantly. They move in together and start making love as much as they can and finally year later, Wade proposes to her, which Vanessa readily accepts. Their joy is short-lived as Wade is diagnosed with terminal cancer, he chooses to break up with Vanessa as he cannot bear the thought of her being stuck with him, Vanessa refuses. Wade is soon approached by a recruiter (Jed Rees) of a top-secret private program which promises Wade to cure him of his cancer but also give him super powers as a bonus. Wade brushes of it as a joke, but then one night leaves a Sleeping Vanessa and enters the program.The program is run by Ajax (Ed Skerin) and assisted by Angel Dust (Gina Carano) who run a series of tests on Wade bordering on gruesome tortures and finally insulted in a verbal battle Ajax reprograms things in such a way Wade's cancer is pushed to go as far as it can go triggering the mutant factor, leaving Wade with a disfigured face and strong super powers.Faking his death, Wade goes in search of Vanessa, but comes to a conclusion with his disfigured she may not accept him, he stays clear of her.He soon dons the red costumes names himself Deadpool based on a death guess game which his friend runs in the bar. Deadpool goes after Ajax aka Francis as the latter had once commented he has the power to change the former's face back to normal.Meanwhile on deadpool's tracks are Collossus (Stephen Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Gina Carino) who want him to join the x- men team.The movie is one hell of a laugh riot and a roller coaster ride of gruesome violence and curse words. Ryan Reynolds is a wow as Deadpool, and brings the character to life.Morena Baccairn is enchanting with her trademark smile and It is Gina Carino as the teenage warhead who gives the movie's most funniest moments, her dead pan expressions are a riot.Tom Holkenberg's music complements the movie's theme as does the crazy credit sequence in the beginning of the movieTim Miller has been successful in getting the comic superhero to life and at the same time should have opted for a more dangerous villain than Francis (Ajax), all in all the movie delivers what it promises.I was just a tad disappointed because of the weak villain, but yes I would recommend it to anyone who would want their superheroes delivered a bit differently",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
what a (very good) Deadpool movie needed to be,"As I left the theater I told my wife, 'you know, Deadpool is kind of like the Muppets of comic book-superhero movies'. It wasn't the wisest comparison (maybe filthy f***ing Bugs Bunny is far more accurate, but I digress), in large part since the Muppets are family entertainment with an edge that can appeal to adults and yet still be good fun for kids, while Deadpool is hard-R action carnage with sometimes (ok, a good lot of the time) lines that will make many, many, many teenagers laugh (and some folks who get a few key references to things outside of this decade). I think I was just responding to the total irreverence of the whole thing, not to mention the constant breaking of the fourth wall - it's not something completely groundbreaking on its own (Spider-Man talks to the audience, for example), but here it's aware of many of the faults that have come up on comic book and super-hero movies, including its own franchise. For me one of the most cathartic moments of this or any recent movie is seeing a short but noticeable image of an action figure of Deadpool from the 2009 Wolverine movie. Which sucked.Why it did is for reasons outside of the 'not getting the character' right thing (though that's part of it), but suffice it to say what director Tim Miller (first timer! impressive that) and the writers (previously of the also super-self-conscious/meta Zombieland), needed to do was to take the p*** out of the genre while also delivering a story that had some heart to it... wait, heart, in a movie that has the ""Merc with the Mouth"" Wade Wilson,, the guy who goes through Weapon-X-program-stuff and comes out with the skin of insert-TJ-Miller-Joke-Here appearance? Sure, why not? If I can take it back to the Muppets one last time those movies had heart to them underneath as well. With this Deadpool movie, there's only a couple of scenes where there's no sarcastic lines or quips or just outright 'I'll talk s*** till the cows come home' stuff, but they do help to give the movie some grounding and keep things moving along well.When I say it's hard-R, I mean it - if you take your kids, make sure they know what they're in for and that despite the appearance of the Xavier School, this is very violent and bloody and with limbs flying and heads rolling and little tiny hands regenerating and... too much said. But for me, at least in the first half of the movie before it got to the climax (which I'll get to in a moment), it was refreshing to see how violent it got. I'm not completely sure if it was Miller and the filmmaers' intentions but I suspected all of bodies laid to waste in sometimes horrifying ways is some kind of comment on how bloodless many of the comic book movies and other X-Men films can get. Sure people die and get stabbed by Wolverine and so on, but there's no consequences. Deadpool is the kind of movie where Colossus (that one big Russian metal guy who was in the other X-Men movie that I don't remember the name of) tries to tell Wade not to hurt any people on a highway where a big gun-sword-battle has happened, Wade says nobody got hurt... and then a guy just falls from up above in the background from his wounds. Oops.It's a big comic spectacle that works better as a comedy, and somewhat as a love story, than as an action film. I say this despite a relatively coolly shot and choreographed opening sequence on a highway - which gets sort of cut back to in time during Wade's introduction in flashback - since when it gets back the fights and stunt work later on, the big climax included, it's just acceptable. The real skill of Miller and his team is in letting Ryan Reynolds take this character where it needs to, which is being a constant talking-s*** badass; by the time it comes down to Deadpool facing down the man who made him who he is, ""Ajax"", the tension isn't fully there just for the reason that Wilson has the ability to regenerate from his injuries (it's one of those they-worked-on-him sort of things).But what's further surprising is that the romantic side of the story works more than I expected thanks to a wonderful set up between Reynolds and Monica Baccarin as Vanessa. They trade barbs in such a way that you wonder if they'll run out of steam; some of their lines are crude, a lot of them very nasty and sex-related, and yet that made it endearing to me when things do get serious between them (the conflict of course that Wilson gets cancer, and all his troubles flow from there). If these actors didn't have good timing and chemistry it would falter, but they don't and so it doesn't, and by the time that the characters get reunited near the end the same spark is still there as are the real levels of sorrow about why they've been apart and what's kept it that way (some of it is Wilson's own doing, the sort of 'look a way I'm a hideous beast' cliché, which I forget if it's even a cliché).Could it have been less low-brow? Maybe. But it's smart enough to be exactly the kind of self-reflexive comic book movie that goes after all of the bulls*** with these movies, from the budgets to Jackman and beyond, and makes its own identity. I found it a lot of fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One of the best Marvel movies and one of the best action comedies in recent memory,"Deadpool is about a man named Wade Wilson who is subjected to a special experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, becoming the alter ego of Deadpool. Now this movie really surprised me. I was going into the movie cautiously, thinking that the jokes might not be funny or the R rating would be there just because. Well now that I've seen it, I can honestly say that this is among Marvel's best movies. To start off, the writing and the humor in this movie are amazing. You can definitely tell that the writers spent so much time trying to stay true to the character of Deadpool and they did an exceptional job. The humor was also hilarious. There are so many quotes that you can take out of this movie and there are so many moments that had me laughing so hard. My favorite aspect of this movie was Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool. He played the character so well that I can't imagine anyone else playing this character. All the other characters, including Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, were exceptional. One thing that surprised me the most was the love story. If you've seen the trailers, Wade Wilson has a girlfriend named Vanessa (played by Morena Baccarin) and their relationship with each other was perfect. The actors have great chemistry and their relationship was actually one that I cared about. Now one thing that the movie has been popular for lately is that the movie is rated R. This is one of the only rated-R superhero movies and it is all for the better. The movie has a lot of language, sexual content, and really strong violence. The good news is that all of this was for the better. The movie uses that R-rating and makes the best adaptation of the Deadpool comic. If there was one thing in this movie that could've been better, it would be the villain. While the villain isn't bad, he's not the best. I guess since everything surrounding it was so exceptional, the villain just comes off as weak. Overall, this is the best adaptation of a comic book character I've ever seen. It is also of one of the best Marvel movies I've ever seen. I give this a 9.5 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Offbeat but not subversive,"Acknowledging the generic nature of your film is one thing, but it's only a half-step towards avoiding being generic at all. For all its off-the-wall innovation, ""Deadpool"" is still a perfect fit for the Marvel movie mould: take a wise-cracking superhero with a helpless sexualised love interest, a 2-dimensional ""British"" villain, and an assortment of bizarre sidekicks, and sprinkle with explosions. Spelling this template out in the wacky opening credits is not defence enough against its conformism.""Deadpool"" attempts to subvert long-established Marvel standards through breaking the 4th wall - a technique which loses its potency in constantly occurring, seemingly more often than actual dialogue - and its absurd jokes. This at least is a success - irreverence piles up as sexual abuse victims, drug addicts and cancer sufferers are all thrown under the bus in the name of Offbeat Humour. Nonetheless, inevitable cringe-inducing superhero epigrams make appearances too. Pop-culture referencing is another tenet of Marvel films and this manifests itself abundantly, to the delight of Marvel aficionados in the audience. Superhero films have always cornered the market in special-FX budgets and cinematography, and ""Deadpool"" is no exception: the action sequences really are breathtaking, the violence fortuitous. The aberrant 15-rated certificate is made full use of with F-bombs and gory lacerations littered like bullet casings throughout.Even though it punches above the level of previous Marvel features, ""Deadpool"" still suffers from the usual pitfalls of plot holes, predictable story arcs, poor emotional pacing, and stock characters. What redeems it is its superior sense of humour, irreverent tone, and subtle boundary-pushing in the form of 4th-wall-breaks and gratuitous violence.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Superhero Acting is Believable,"I never liked superhero stile movies, because the actors who play those superheroes are so pathetic and unrealistic. I mean, you don't believe they have super powers in spite their serious faces and a lot of trying. But in this movie, wow! Ryan Reynolds acts like he really has Super Powers, and he doesn't even trying to persuade you to believe that his acting is good. And he is funny to boot. I didn't give the movie 10 stars, because in my opinion an actress who played Vanessa/CopyCat had to be much Younger and Prettier.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Not for everyone,"As I sat in the theatre on opening day, hearing roars of laughter burst from all around me at a scene I hadn't realized was meant to be funny, I realized that this movie is great. It's not intelligent, original, deep, or insightful in anyway. Obviously though, it isn't meant to be. It's a film which targets people who like crude and obnoxious humour (reminiscent of Archer), and succeeds in its entirety. Although I personally rarely laughed, I came to terms that it simply isn't my type of film. I appreciated that it's fourth wall breaking, self aware, over the top humour was done perfectly for mainstream audiences. Ryan Reynolds even gives a solid performance, portraying an adequate amount of emotion during his origin story while remaining light hearted and comedic during the majority of the film. I could dull this review down by naming countless minor flaws I found through the films runtime but that would be pointless.

This movie is a cliché,"of a movie that tries to be cliché.At one point I had to ask myself if the dialogue and jokes were written by a ten year old.The movie tries so hard to stay true to that edgy annoying shtick that was laid out, and ends up looking tryhard in the process of trying to be tryhard, if you catch my drift.The ""humor"" was extremely predictable. The plot was extremely predictable.You have to be simple-minded to enjoy this tripe. I love dark, sarcastic and dry humor, but this movie was a terrible attempt.That this movie has a 7+ rating shows you how simpletons easily fall victim to the hive mind hype carried out primarily by comic-dorks who struggled with aspergers in high school and their social life in general.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Deadpool: The Superhero Who Thinks He's a Comedian,"Deadpool is that guy in red tights who dishes out more jokes than punches. Here, we're far from the classic superhero like Superman or Captain America. Wade Wilson, aka Deadpool, is a lunatic, a guy who probably needed a therapist more than a skintight suit. And that's exactly why it works. Tim Miller throws you a movie where action mixes with dark humor like a pint of beer at a stand-up comedy show.Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. The guy has found the role of a lifetime, one that lets him say everything that's on his mind, especially about others. And damn, it feels good. Reynolds fires off lines like a machine gun that never stops. You laugh, you choke, you think, ""Did he really just say that?"" Yep, he did. And it totally works.The action scenes are intense. You can tell Tim Miller wanted to please fans of gritty brawls but with a healthy dose of absurdity. Deadpool shoots someone point-blank while throwing out a filthy joke, and honestly, it just works. You see blood, but you laugh. Because deep down, Deadpool is the guy who reminds you that life is one big joke, and sometimes, it's better to laugh than cry.Okay, we have to talk about the villain, played by Ed Skrein. Yeah, he's the guy who thinks he can go toe-to-toe with Deadpool. Let's just say he stands about as much chance as a cat in a bubble bath. But that's what makes it all the more fun. Deadpool gets under his skin, and we love it. Because in the end, we're here to watch the chaos Wade Wilson creates everywhere he goes, and the other characters are just extras in his one-man show.Deadpool is the movie that dares to do everything, even the unacceptable. And that's what we love about it. No morals, no lessons, just fun, trash, and unapologetic nonsense. If you're in the mood to laugh while watching people get obliterated, this is definitely the movie for you. And if you're easily offended, well... move along, because Deadpool doesn't have a filter. And that's exactly why we adore him.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Wow! This was not the superhero movie I was expecting, but man, it was hilarious and I thoroughly enjoyed the heck out of it!!","Alright, so I know I'm late to the party since this has been out for about 8 years, but I finally decided to watch ""Deadpool"" recently and I got to say: this was quite different from all the other typical superhero movies, and I loved it! All the self-aware humor, the ""breaking the fourth wall"" jokes, the action, and Ryan Reynolds made this movie stand-out and was quite refreshing for a superhero movie. Now it is definitely for adults or at least a mature audience, but still, that allowed for more creative freedom and among the other reasons, made ""Deadpool"" one of the best superheroes in today's world!So I will admit right-off-the-bat, the plot is one that is kind of used before (the hero strikes a bargain with someone for something better, but then they get tricked by that person who turns out to be the villain and something happens to the hero that negatively impacts their lives and they seek out revenge), but the way it was presented was pretty cool. Had a good blend of humor and drama and what the plot lacked in creativity it made up for with sharp dialogue from the characters and cool action sequences as well. So, the plot was pretty decent overall.Now for the part that really held the movie up: the abundance of self-aware humor and all the fourth wall jokes! I never read the Deadpool comics and therefore, didn't know the character broke the wall so much, but that came as a surprise to me when I saw the movie and the character was making so many self-aware jokes about himself and the other characters (and occasionally about the actors, particularly Reynolds himself) and a few times, I almost fell out of seat because they were so hilarious. Was not expecting that at all, but as someone who personally loves it when a film breaks the fourth wall and has self-aware humor, I was thoroughly impressed with how this movie did it and it was quite enjoyable.Besides the humor, the action sequences and the romance scenes were done pretty good as well. The chemistry between Wade and Vanessa was done really well and quite realistic and made you root for them (though there were a few steamy sex moments, so be prepared for that). The action sequences were done really well too and even if there was CGI involved, the direction of the action was nicely paced and kept you interested and focused on what was happening. They were pretty violent though, so I would say be prepared for that as well.Lastly, here's what made the move the best: Ryan Reynolds. I swear, his performance as Deadpool was hands down the best part of the movie. He played him so naturally and it was like he didn't even have to audition for the role. The man was hilarious all the way through, and I'm pretty sure most of Deadpool's dialogue was not written and Reynolds improvise most, if not all, of his lines (I know not all of them were that, but a good chunk of them seemed like they were). Also, to be honest, I think this was the movie where Reynolds really came out of his shell and established himself as a top, leading actor. I know he had already been acting for a while before this and was known in some films, like ""Just Friends"", ""Definitely, Maybe"", ""The Proposal"", and ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", but to me, he seemed to really step up with ""Deadpool"" and really showcase what he can do with his acting and compared to those films, he showed Hollywood that he can lead a film easily with sharp wit and clever dialogue. So definitely, I say kudos to Ryan for really stepping up to the plate and knocking it out of the park with Deadpool!That's pretty much all I have to say about ""Deadpool"" and why it was good. Like I said, it is aimed at an older audience with its violence, sex scenes, and some of the dialogue (the only discretions I'd advise), but still, the sharp witty humor and Ryan Reynolds killing it as the main character make the film a huge refresher for the superhero genre and I'd recommend it if you still haven't seen it yet.So please, go see it! (and the sequels as well!)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Goatpool,"We've seen Ryan Reynolds portray this character before, and thankfully the movie has too, this is a revenge story and a love story following one of my favorite superheroes, the merc with the mouth.I didn't know what to expect going into this film, we've already seen Reynolds portray this character once in X-Men: Origins, and man did that fail, never sew shut the mouth of the merc with the mouth, never do that again ever, ok? OkAnd I was blown away from this movie, I'm taking back what I said about X-Men: Apocalyse, this is my favorite X-Men film so far even though I haven't seen Logan yet, so that might change, I loved every single second of this film.Deadpool is one of the funniest superhero movies I've ever seen, honestly, it's the 2nd funniest Marvel movie right behind No Way Home, they had no qualms being incredibly crude, and it was all the better for it, the timing in which this film came out benefited it extremely, in relation to all the superhero saturation of 2015-2019, but Deadpool knows what world it's in, it breaks the 4th wall unlike anything I've ever seen before, Ryan Reynolds is one of the best comic book castings of all time as Deadpool, he had played the character before this but was 1000x better here, he didn't have one bad scene.There is not a single dull moment in Deadpool, let's talk about Tim Miller's direction, it is incredible, the action is phenomenal, there's no shaky cam, not too many cuts, and great bits of CGI, it is refreshingly in camera.Deadpool has a white knuckled, extremely high stakes and absolutely hilarious finale, which catapulted it to a 10/10 level.I loved everything about Deadpool, it's at least a Top 10 Marvel movie for sure, I can't believe I'm about to say this, Deadpool gets an A+The next Citizen Kane?

a timely trendsetter for the jaded superhero genre,"Ryan Reynolds' much hyped anti-hero, DEAD POOL finally bags his own feature film, seven years after his first-appearance in X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE (2009), and it becomes the latest box- office phenomenon, both domestically and internationally. What are the odds it is against? Firstly, its R-rate manifestly shows the guts to forfeit the increasingly important (profit-wise) Chinese market (the same as last year's MAD MAX: FURY ROAD 2015), and still profits; secondly, it has been dumped to a lousy February release signifies either that the production company doesn't have high hopes for it, or much more commendably, a left-field strategy to ignite the heat from the rock bottom; last but not least, its modest budget, estimated $58 millions, is significantly lower than any major studio superhero commodities, which promises a higher rate of return and indicates a new franchise is in the offing.DEADPOOL is director Tim Miller's feature debut, and it punchily and timely injects a paradigm- shifting novelty into Hollywood's mainstay genre where Marvel and DC Comics reside. From the stop-motion and self-mocking opening credits backing with ANGEL OF THE MORNING, viewers are induced to get enchanted by this unorthodox and loquacious mutant, his trademark breaking-the- fourth-wall (at one time it multiples up to sixteenth) interactions are tremendously entertaining, not to mention the ceaseless gags (its teasing victims vary from pop culture, comic book characters, showbiz celebrities, to the protagonist Reynolds himself), salacious innuendos, pulpy slaughters and gallows humour, which all dampen the pretty dark and grisly happenings of how Wade Wilson, a mercenary suffers from cancer eventually becomes Deadpool, a defaced super-human with impeccable healing powers.Surprisingly, the plot itself is a conventional boy-meets-girl, boy-leaves-girl, then boy-saves-girl three-act, and the British villain Ajex (Skrien), has no ambitious agenda to destroy the world or humanity, he is simply sadistic and enjoys beating the pulp out of his opponent or being battered since he has lost all the feelings, where Deadpool's recovery ability makes him a perfect rival. Noticeably, due to its budget, the movie doesn't involve too many exorbitant WTF visual spectacles, and action pieces are quite numbered, Deadpool's only mutant allies are the preachy Colossus (voiced by Kapicic), and a young Sinead O'Connor lookalike Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Hilderbrand), still, he beats Ajex, who has just one sidekick, Angel Dust (Carano, the girl who can fight but cannot act). Yet, the outcome is mostly rewarding, especially when viewers appetite has been pampered with too many bombardments.Reynolds spares no effort in showing off his ripped bod and pulls off Deadpool's unusually audience-friendly character, it is a long-waited recognition and hopefully his career will steer to a new direction. Wade's love interest Vanessa (Baccani), whose mutant background has been omitted here, is the only one who plays with a straight-face to at least verify the slightly uninspiring storyline, whereas T.J. Miller's Weasel, triumphantly upstages others with his competence as a constant purveyor of comic relief.The sequel has already been put on the agenda, so as a trend-setter, DEADPOOL sets up a new double-wining (both word-of-mouth and box office performance) template for studio franchises and a high bar for its follow-ups, let's wish it is not just a flash in the pan.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Deadpool - I don't care, I was bored, and I still liked it.","Deadpool - reviewI have to admit, after watching this movie, I believe I am becoming a little fatigued with these comic-book movies, and or maybe I just wasn't excited enough to see this movie. I've watched all of the advertisements and I've seen all of the trailers. I wasn't anticipating this movie as much as hardcore Deadpool fans. The only reason I paid a ticket to see this comic-book movie is because, almost everybody on the freaking internet has been ranting, raving, and losing their minds over this movie. Seriously, almost everybody on the god ""forsaken"" internet has been telling me how good and funny this movie is.Here it goes...Positives...1. I laughed two or three times2. The love story was engaging (I admit, I got a little tear eyed)3. The action scenes were well choreographed4. The action scenes were slightly well directed5. Ryan Reynolds nails it as Deadpool6. The final fight scene got my adrenaline pumping7. The guy who played Colossus did a fantastic job (keep him)8. Gina Carano is HOT! (Personal Note)Negatives...1. I was bored a majority of the runtime up until the end (I almost wanted to go to sleep)2. Action scenes could of been shot better (give me more wide frame shots, hold the camera still, and stop the fast editing)Overall...I didn't really have a major problem with this movie. The truth is... I just don't care about Deadpool. I would watch this movie again if someone wanted to see it for the first time. If Deadpool was on TV I'd watch it.

The Merc With a Mouth,"Tragic antihero ""Deadpool"", also known as Canadian mercenary Wade Wilson, first turned up in the comic book ""New Mutants"" in 1990. Created by writer Fabian Nicieza and artist Rob Liefeld he was originally portrayed as something of a bad guy. Like Doctor Doom, Magneto or Black Swan the character seemed to be a card-carrying member of Marvel Comics' growing collection of colorful villains. But boy, things were certainly about to change.In 2009, actor Ryan Reynolds donned the red spandex suit for the first time. That was in the movie ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" where Deadpool had a small supporting role. Unfortunately the production was plagued by problems right from the start. While principal photography rolled in Australia, the writers were struggling with an unfinished screenplay. Consequently, the film received poor reviews. Reynolds, though, was singled out for his fine performance in the lead role.Director Tim Miller began preparing a new movie with Deadpool even before Ryan Reynolds had finished his role in ""X-Men Origins"". The filmmaker wanted to ignore previous versions of the sword-wielding mercenary and instead return to his roots in comics. Miller was therefore looking for slapstick humor and sharper dialogue. By this point, however, the studio's executives had begun to worry about the film's R-rated content. Fortunately they calmed down when some test footage was leaked online. After all, the new material was met with an overwhelmingly enthusiastic response from hardcore fans.After an unconventional marketing campaign, ""Deadpool"" premiered in the United States in February 2016. To many people's surprise, the film was both a financial and artistic success. At the box office ""Deadpool"" took in over $780 million against a $58 million budget, making it the highest-grossing R-rated film ever. And, once again, the critics praised Ryan Reynolds for his accomplishment in the main role.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Everything Deadpool Should Be,"Deadpool might be the most original and innovative comic book movie yet. Not innovative in terms of the story or most of the characters, but in the execution and the title character, Deadpool. Now, I was not very familiar with Deadpool before this film. I first learned of the character's existence when playing the video game, Marvel Ultimate Alliance. Ever since, I've seen the character hyped-up like mad in the geek community, which surprised me considering I didn't even know of the character until recently at that time.The first attempted to bring this character to the big screen was in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which did not go over well to say the least. They didn't seem to get the character at all. I didn't even know much about Deadpool then, but I knew enough to know they dropped the ball in portraying him. This film feels very much like an apology for that train wreck.Well, apology accepted! Deadpool was an extremely fun and exciting film. On the surface it seems like another superhero/revenge movie like The Punisher, Dirty Harry, Deathwish, and so on, but that's not the case.It sounds incredibly formulaic on paper but it all comes down to execution, which this film does right. It doesn't take itself that seriously. This film is as much a comedy as it is a superhero/revenge flick. In fact, it's more of a comedy. I think it's great how this film can poke fun at all the clichés of these kinds of films and, at the same time, embrace them. This movie reminds me of the anime One Punch Man in that regard, and it works for many of the same reasons.This time around, the studio truly nailed what the character, Deadpool, is from the costume to his dark sense of humor. There is no doubt we're going to much more of Deadpool in movies in the future which I'm fine with. It's great that Marvel isn't the only studio that is taking more obscure characters and making them mainstream. I might have to read some Deadpool comics now.The production values are great as well. The action is top notch, the violence is on point, the effects are great, and it's competently shot. They even got two X-Men in the film which I did not see coming. But they turned out to be welcome additions that brought some good humor and action scenes. These X-Men look more comic book-esc than the X-Men in any of the X-Men movies thus far. In fact, this might be 20th Century Fox's first comic book film that is the closest to being a comic book yet. The closest being the first two (official) Fantastic Four movies.The film has a couple minor issues for me. There's quite a lot of raunchy humor in the film which I didn't care for. While I know it's a part of Deadpool's character, I'm not the biggest fan of that type of humor. I think it's the lowest form of humor, second only to fart humor. But, fortunately, there were plenty of other jokes to offset it. Most of the other jokes hit, particularly the fourth wall jokes.Overall, Deadpool is definitely the film the character deserved. The film is not for everyone. If you're squeamish or don't like raunchy humor this is probably not for you. If you know what you're getting into you should enjoy yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Banal, puerile, staid, mostly awful and predictable humourless 'super' hero movie","I'm so glad to see that there are actually other people on the planet who think this film was terrible. Everyone is losing their minds over the film on social media billing it as the best film they've ever seen ever. I think its got something to do with 'breaking the fourth wall' (something Malcolm in the Middle did expertly), making jokes only funny in a 13 year-old boy's changing rooms, unnecessary graphic violence and nudity which is absolutely unnecessary... that is until you realise that this film has been written by/for people who still think farts are funny. The humour in this film isn't even as sophisticated as White Chicks or Scary Movie. It's not a parody either. As an example, the guy behind the bar delivers his lines like he's reading them for the first time. No comic timing, no life, no urgency. That may be his character but whatever comedy is supposed to be in his dialogue goes missing immediately. They also take jokes too far. Sometimes, just leading a viewer into the realm of a joke is fine, leave them there, let them get it themselves - not Deadpool. It's like they knew people with the sense of humour of a 9 year old would be relishing every pointlessly gory banal second and they not only explain the joke, but they keep talking a good minute after the joke has been, gone and not been laughed at; still telling the same joke.In short - no, this is not the best film you've ever seen ever. For that (in a comic book adaptation), go watch The Dark Knight or The Avengers. This film's storyline, jokes and content have all been either written by or for adolescent boys who still think 'boobies' are things to snigger behind your hand at at the back of a biology lesson. Everyone involved in this film needs to grow up and so do the people leaving 10 star reviews. I'm sure if they watched Postman Pat the movie and he swore, they'd give that 10 stars too.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Funny, entertaining, and refreshing !!","The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film a strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.Yes, This is what it looks like when filmmakers take risks!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

This is how you suppose to make super hero movies,"There are always a ton of super Hero movies that have been made and are in the making.But I've always watched these super hero movies, and ""Deadpool"" hit a certain nerve in me. In the most positive way.Comic book movies seem to be all about franchises nowadays. ""Building a universe"". Setting up sequels, setting up spin-offs, setting up everything - and often forgetting to be a movie on their own, like what arguably happened with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron, and even more shockingly happened with Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice.I would not be not surprised if Deadpool is going to head straight into that circus of brands and formulaic nothingness, because at this point it's clear how successful this movie was. But I can hope for something better, because this movie was actually really fun to watch.This film is almost like a parody of superhero films, which is what the comics were, a parody of superhero comics. It is not only self- aware, but painfully aware of the whole superhero movie business too. Expect some jokes about that. In Deadpool, our main characters often say what the audience is thinking. The fourth wall gets broken, and sometimes the movie feels like it's more of a weird mind game than a movie. And that is what makes this so much more special and original among all of these same formulated superhero films.While ""Deadpool"" doesn't take many things seriously, and it sure enough is not a serious movie, it still seems to take itself seriously in what it's trying to do. And somehow it works. R-rated violence, strong language, weird sense of humor and this lack of restraint of course helps, but there is a real heart to this movie that isn't defined by any of these things. Perhaps it's the source material and the respect director Miller, writers Reese+Wernick and actor/producer Reynolds pay to it. Perhaps it's the fact they wanted to make a movie, not just something for brand recognition. All I can say is that in a crazy movie like this, I don't expect go see any heartfelt, naturally emotional moments. But I did. This movie has a heart.Reynolds is very entertaining as the main character, and right now I can't see anyone else pulling it off. Well done. Morena Baccarin is good, and special mention goes to Brianna Hildebrand, I had fun with her playing her role straight in a movie like this. Actors do a fine job, and even the CGI Colossus didn't bother me too much.One hour and a half went by quickly, and I got my money's worth. A simple, tight story that has fun with itself and the current state of superhero movies. Not once did I feel like there was a ""message"" being pounded to my head, and not once did I feel like I have to suffer formulaic boredom in the name of cinematic universes. No cities get demolished in this movie. I missed that. Not all comic book movies need to have the same threats, same boring 200 million dollar visuals of cities crumbling. The ending felt very fitting too, and overall I had a very good time in the theater.""Deadpool"" is a weird example of how less is more, and how at the same time daring to cross formulaic boundaries can be rewarding.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
DeadPool- Exciting and Funny,I am definitely late on this movie but I was blessed to get to see it last night. I must say that I was impressed. The movie was cleverly written and it also brought some things to the comedy genre that I had never seen before. For example the opening credits had a fun twist. It is good to see something different in the comedy genre instead of the same old techniques that we see in your everyday comedy movie. Along side the comedy DeadPool manages to tell an interesting story which is not common among comedy movies. It was also exciting to watch especially during the fighting sequences which were greatly choreographed and easy to follow. The final fight was really exciting and I enjoyed watching it. One thing that bugged me was that a lot of the best jokes could be seen in the trailer. I think I would have enjoyed the movie more if I had not seen some of the jokes that were played in the movie already in the trailer. However I laughed at them the first time I saw them in the trailer so still a success. Basically when making a comedy movie you have to put some jokes in the trailer to show it is a comedy so I can't complain too much. Overall DeadPool was a success and I am excited to see what else the franchise could have in store.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Truly awful,"The name Deadpool itself sounds pretty stupid, and it doesn't get much better than this. The name means nothing, like some inside joke that no one gets. It comes across in the movie trail like this is a hip character, but in the movie he comes across more like some unemployed loser who you'd expect living in his mother's basement geeking-out practicing fighting sequences and sewing his silly costume.It is hard to imagine something with such a big budget and hype turned out to be a complete and utter waste of time. It had zero entertainment value. The character Deadpool appears to be intended to be a sort of R-rated version of a hero, when it is more of a poorly created watered down version of Agent 86 but with unfunny lines. Not sure who the intended audience for this is, but simply having a superhero use profanity isn't funny or interesting. His motives make no sense and this movie is filled with overly long fighting/action sequences that are boring.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
OKish,"I am very surprised to see this movie with such a high rating, I was looking forward to watching it especially since nearly everybody had given it rave reviews. Having watched it, I must say I am bitterly disappointed - if ever a movie suffered because it was over-hyped, this is it. I'm not saying its a terrible movie, badly acted or even badly conceived action sequences - its all just OK. I didn't find it particularly funny, his inane quips even started getting on my nerves by the end of the movie. Its worth watching if you are a fan of comic book heroes, you may even enjoy it - I just found it all a bit samey, if this movie was a colour it would be beige, its OK but don't believe the hype like I did and expect it to be great!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Not for everyone,"The first reaction watching this movie, from quite early on, is ""where did they get the movie to make it?!"".Deadpool is a niche movie: it is for aging super hero fans, who like their violence and their geekie references. It can't by definition for everyone.If you are a in the targeted audience, then it's really fun: the jokes work, the violence is enjoyable and Ryan Reynolds delivers. You can tell he's passionate.It is not a GREAT movie either: you can feel some budget constraints + honestly the villains aren't that bad. I was however giggling the whole way and liked this fresh (at least on the silver screen) take on Marvel.Recommended",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Okay Okay Deadpool is Okay,"I am happy to say that DEADPOOL is an okay movie. It ranks alongside an adequate school play ... or a good musician in the park ... or a McDonald's cheeseburger. It satisfies your hunger for 90 minutes and is almost instantly forgotten. A lot has been said about DEADPOOL's sex, violence and profanity giving it an R-rating and making it unsuitable for kids. I agree that kids shouldn't see the movie, but not because it will haunt their dreams or corrupt their morality. The action is so cartoonish (in one sequence, in fact, cartoons actually appear on screen) that it can only be taken with a grain of salt. Ryan Reynolds' performance reminds one of Jim Carrey circa LIAR LIAR; hyper, snarky, sarcastic and overplayed to the hilt. Reynolds breaks the fourth wall early and often - at one point, when told that ""looks aren't everything"" he replies, ""Yes they are. Do you think Ryan Reynolds has had a career based on his acting ability?"" In another fourth wall-breaker, he notices that there are only two X-Men characters at the huge X-Men Mansion, leading him to say, ""You'd think the studio could spring for a few more X-Men ..."" Reynolds has fun with the character and does make it his own. Morena Baccarin is very appealing love interest, and the two X-Men counterparts are adequate. Of course this is a Marvel (albeit Fox) film so there is the wiseass sidekick named Weasel, here played by T.J. Miller and in other recent Marvel projects played by Elden Henson (Netflix's Daredevil), Michael Pena (Ant-Man), Ty Simpkins (Iron Man 3), Kat Dennings (Thor & Thor 2). Marvel's writers have obviously locked the stock wiseass sidekick into their word processors and won't let go of them. At least Miller's variation isn't quite as annoying as Henson's, which caused me to scuttle Daredevil after less than a half-hour. The villains are pretty standard-issue. Ed Skrein appears with no backstory, no motivation and lacking only a pitchfork and pointy tail to tell us that he's the super-evil bad guy. His character, like Deadpool, cannot be harmed in any permanent way, making them a pair of Terminators duking it out until one can figure out the secret formula. I figured that Deadpool had to go Highlander-style and cut off his head (hence the swords) to kill him, but apparently not. Deadpool is an amusing exercise but lacks the memorability of the best comic book films. After seeing The Dark Knight Rises, I literally hummed the ""Bane theme"" (Deshi Basara) for two weeks. I remembered the epic hand-to-hand battle in Gotham with everything at stake. The army of cops vs the army of villains. After Batman Begins, I couldn't wait to tell friends about the amazing cast, the new Batmobile/Tumbler and pictured the great scenes over and over. Avengers had moments that brought down the house, when Hulk smashed Loki and uttered ""puny god"" or when he punched Thor right out of the frame. Great comic book movies leave a taste in your mouth for weeks to come. You go back and revisit them over and over. Deadpool doesn't offer these things. There's no score of note (pardon the pun) or songs to remember, no set pieces to memorize, no toys to run out and buy. It's simply 90 minutes of motion with an occasional chuckle. It was like watching my kids play soccer - it was fun and made me grin, but now that it's over ... what's for dinner? Deadpool doesn't aspire to greatness but satisfies just enough to make it a mild diversion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Deadpool is a violent comic-book flick with bad language, nudity and plenty of gore to boot.","Comic-book/Superhero movies are not my ideal genre, I rarely watch them and baring the odd exception I find them relatively uninteresting. I had heard positive things about Deadpool, I was told it wasn't your average superhero movie and despite my reservations I decided to give it a go. Starting with a beautifully constructed intro scene, it was clear from the get-go that this wasn't what I have come to expect from previous superhero movies. It was violent with graphic gore, had bad language and had a unique spoof comic-book style; from the first few minutes I was laughing at the one-liners and enjoying the violence, I was hooked.I was expecting the humour to be forced and awkward, the trailers made it look this way and I honestly didn't expect to find it all that funny. At the start it did feel slightly off to me but once I adjusted to the style everything clicked and it worked, completely. From the timing of the one-liners to the witty narrative, it's simply a well humoured movie which had me laughing to myself on many occasions. Some jokes did miss the target with me but this is to be expected and isn't something which I can put the movie down for. The choreography in the action scenes along with the graphic violence was very refreshing and when it was mixed with a little dry humour it made for some impressive sequences. There's some slapstick in the action scenes with immature humour which isn't really to my taste. Thankfully this was relatively minimal and was balanced out enough to not bog the movie down. Whilst the movie is violent and graphic, it's not quite at Game of Thrones levels of gore so don't let this put you off too much if you're one of the squeamish types.The run-time is perfect, at 105 minutes the movie doesn't drag for a single second, and other directors should take note that not all anticipated, big screen movies need to be 2+ hours just for the sake of it. We are thrown into the action straight away before being shown detailed backstory through the use of flashbacks. This happens throughout the movie as the story unravels revealing how Deadpool was created. It's very well done and although a little predictable it doesn't give everything away too early and I was kept intrigued, wanting to know what was going to happen next.Despite being completely ridiculous and not taking itself seriously, Deadpool manages to achieve a sense of emotion; the love relationship is kept sharp and works with the plot. Love stories are a given in practically every single genre of movie nowadays, even more so in superhero flicks and Deadpool does a good enough job of not making it too overpowering or distracting. Paying homage to other comic books and other movies is a nice touch and although some I could appreciate I feel that many went over my head due to my lack of superhero/comic book knowledge or interest. The score was fantastic with a fantastic soundtrack, this is another thing which worked perfectly with the movie and was one of the things I really appreciated. Getting the music right is a tough ask for movies and an even tougher one for a movie like this. It has a great mix of music which all compliments the movie well.Overall my expectations for Deadpool were very low due to my own personal movie taste and also the trailers which didn't look overly appealing. As the credits rolled to yet another strangely perfect song from the fantastic soundtrack, I was filled with a huge sense of enjoyment. I had just watched a movie which I thoroughly enjoyed even though all the signs were pointing towards it being a film I was going to dislike. Its witty, violent, cool, excellently choreographed and downright adrenaline pumped. Go see it as soon as you can and don't forget the popcorn.8/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
It's not easy to pull Deadpool off,"Deadpool as a character is not easy to do. Many writers have tried their hand at the Deadpool comics, and for a lot of people, his sense of humor seems to be wacky, random, and of the nonsensical ""monkeycheese"" variety. I maintain that there is, and always has been, a method to Deadpool's madness. Without it, the character quickly becomes tiresome and annoying. It's the difference between a noisy eight year old and in-jokes shared with friends.Ryan Reynolds nails it. This movie is incredible. It is sharp, weird, and funny in all the right ways. This is the Deadpool I like. Over the top without being too over the top, referential, and not afraid to break the fourth wall -- but with just enough tact to save it from being incomprehensible. And it's violent. Deadpool *has* to be violent.The only complaint I have is that for the first half of the movie, it jumps back and forth a little too much, and there's a stretch where things drag just a bit when the movie threatens to take itself a little too seriously in order to give Deadpool some pathos. It's necessary, I suppose, but it also feels a tiny bit formulaic for my tastes; like the movie HAD to have some kind of romance because it's a movie and movies have to have romance, or something. It's a small complaint, though, and if we're being honest, it doesn't REALLY get in the way.Every other part of this is a movie worth gushing about. Just, gosh, wow. I almost don't even believe this movie exists, because it is so pitch perfect. You should probably watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"""And that's why Regina rhymes with fun.""","I had zero expectations for this because growing up I never cared for the comic book character Deadpool and the previous version of that character in the dreadful X-Men Origins: Wolverine, also played by Ryan Reynolds, was nothing to get excited about. But this was actually a very entertaining movie with lots of action and humor. I think it's one of the rare comic book movies that has just as much, if not more, appeal to the mainstream than to the fanboy set. Ryan Reynolds is funny and charming and I immediately wanted to forgive him for his past cinematic sins. The movie plays to his strengths as the likable frat boy (Van Wilder) much better than his last attempt at launching a superhero franchise (Green Lantern). The rest of the cast is decent, although this is Reynolds' show all the way. He controls every scene and thankfully has a good chemistry with all of his co-stars. The action scenes are very nicely done, as well, although the movie's climax is a little flat. The only real negative is that the CGI Colossus is pretty terrible-looking. Thankfully his role in the movie and how he plays off Reynolds and others provides lots of laughs. Still, he looks like a big cartoon and that is a little distracting. Anyway, this is a fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously and gives the audience some great popcorn entertainment. Definitely worth a look even if you don't typically like these kind of movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Ryan Reunolds' best yet!,"Ryan Reynolds is certainly a rising star in Hollywood! Deadpool is certainly proof! Reynolds has been one of my favorite comedians since Blade Trinity; his delivery of lines was superb and his on-screen presence was uncanny, hearkening back to my previous action-comedian, Eddie Murphy, so Reynolds was a welcome addition to the current actors in Hollywood. Deadool is a delightful progression to Reynolds' career and a wonderful departure from his lackluster string of weak movies and lame comedies. Action-comedy is a great fit for this actor. Deadpool's high-octane action is a terrific showcase for the delivery of the character's brilliant one-liners and other comedic elements. The nudity fit the tone of the movie and didn't feel gratuitous This has been addressed, but unfortunately this isn't a kid friendly movie, lots of violence, gore, profanity, and nudity, should appeal to most mature audiences who aren't prudish and or delusional. This movie's not for the casual comic fan, but someone who doesn't mind the grittier side of superheroes!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Great Deadpool Film, Decent Superhero Film","After Fox screwed up the beloved Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, fans wanted the character done justice, the right way. And, in 2016, Fox delivered. Deadpool is a fun superhero movie that tries hard not to be a ""conventional"" superhero movie. Does it succeed? Somewhat.Why I felt the film was fun and decent, but not great, was that it focused so much on being an R-rated superhero comedy movie that it fell short on being a really good superhero comedy movie (See my other ratings on the Marvel and DC films). Deadpool satirizes the PG-13 conventional superhero film that has not-too-violent action sequences, minimal swearing, and little to no nudity and basically overloads on everything that can possibly make the movie R-rated. The plot was minimal at best and doesn't expand on the X-Men Universe or storyline, because the film wanted to focus on Deadpool and his R-rated antics. The film has its emotional moments, but the comedic gist of this film overshadows everything and makes those moments a bit harder to soak in and absorb than any other superhero movie would.The comedy for me was hit and miss. There were sequences and meta-jokes (that broke the fourth wall) that I thought were hilarious and perfectly written and delivered; they were jokes that would please any fan who would speculate and imagine the perfect Deadpool movie. There were also sequences that fell rather dull; sometimes jokes were funny, but not THAT funny. It depends on your sense of humor of course; if you love X-Men and dirty, raunchy humor, you'll LOVE this movie. If raunchy humor isn't for you, you'll still find the movie funny. The comedy writing seems to cover all sorts of genres when it comes to humor, and, as a result, can fall flat at certain times while hit well at others.Fans of Deadpool will probably love this movie. Fans of superhero films might love it, but might also feel like something is missing with the writing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Well, maybe if you dunked Jim Carrey into the fountain of youth, he would've probably been able to blow everyone else away. Speaking of, that's what this whole thing kind of reminded me of. Deadpool is the Ace Ventura of superheroes. He wins any battle by being a total clown. Not only is Deadpool a joker, but this whole movie throws a pie at the Superhero renaissance of this decade. Every cliché and plot device gets their ass handed to them. I would say it breaks the fourth wall, but that would mean that there is a wall here to begin with, and there is none.

Daredevil Meets Terminator Meets Freddie Kruger: Comic-Action Thriller Which Breaks the Fourth Wall,"The antihero Deadpool engages in four main activities: body slams, body impaling, shoot 'em-up's, and wisecracks. Probably the last one is what gives Deadpool its primary trademark, although the wisecracks are not necessarily directed to other characters. Deadpool, throughout the film which was true of the original Marvel creation, stops what he's doing, looks at the camera and speaks to the audience in true Kevin Spacey style. He even breaks further walls when he references the studio who financed the film and how they couldn't afford other X-Men characters.The film begins with a kind of CGI still of one of the action sequences with unusual credits. Instead of the typical ""starring such-and-such"", the opening credits say things like ""Starring God's Perfect Idiot"" for the star and ""A British Villain"" for the baddie, and my favorite ""Directed by An Overpaid Tool"" instead of naming the talent. This was actually one of the cleverest parts of the film. Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) has donned a costume, using the name Deadpool, and is on his way to meet his English-accented nemesis. He's in a cab on his way to meeting the guy who corrupted his face and body. His face looks like Freddie Kruger of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" fame ""crossed"" with a topographical map of Utah, according to his sort-of-friend and bartender Weasel.Then we flash-back a couple of years before Wade Wilson became Deadpool. He was your friendly neighborhood rough-em-up for hire. If you were in bad company of people who were even more amoral than you, you could hire Wilson to rough them up, or possibly eliminate them, depending upon your needs. Wilson hangs at a bar of strange and very wicked characters who makes the guy wanted in ""12 systems"" in the bar at Mos Eisley in the original Star Wars seem like a high-class gentleman. Wilson takes care of business there, and a constant betting pool is shown on a blackboard at the back of the bar. People actually bet on whether a regular in the bar might be killed. Weasel even bets Wilson would be the victim! There, Wilson meets the love of his life, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), and they begin first as a sex couple but eventually fall in love with each other. Until, Wilson finds out he has terminal cancer.He explains the situation to Weasel, telling him he has ""el cancer"" in more parts of his body than he can count. Then he meets a strange man who claims to be part of a government operation to make those who are terminally ill into better and stronger people. Sort of the ""$6 Million Man"" for Mutants. He goes to the ""clinical"" where he meets Ajax, real name Francis (Ed Skrein), who informs him that this is not a governmental agency at all but rather an independent operation. They make ""new"" people out of terminally ill patients then sell them to the highest bidder as mutant slaves. Ajax injects Wilson with some kind of mutating drug which won't create a bodily reaction unless Wilson is subjected to all kinds of torture. The last one does, but it changes his skin and face into the equivalent of pale hamburger. The only positive effect: his cancer is cured. He is able to leave the ""clinic"" under a rather complex set of circumstances.Then Wilson tries to find Vanessa, but he is reluctant to face her because of his changed looks. He then moves in as a tenant of a blind woman name of Blind Al (Leslie Uggams). He wants a cure for his disfigurement and creates the red costume and adopts the name Deadpool looking for Ajax/Francis. He batters and slashes people in the most horrendous of situations looking for Ajax, but referring to him as ""Francis"". Ajax realizes he's on his trail, and in retaliation, he kidnaps Vanessa.This film is reasonably well-written, and I liked the breaking of the fourth wall with Deadpool's comments. Deadpool's witticisms reference pop culture such as ""I'm gonna do to your face what Limp Bizkit did to music in the late 90s!"" or "" I had another Liam Neeson nightmare. I kidnapped his daughter and he just wasn't having it."" At first he tells us the film is a love story but later contradicts himself and says it's really a horror movie.The storyline is pretty basic as far as superhero films go: baddie does something horrendous to the ""hero"" and kidnaps girlfriend, and hero has to save her. Within the larger framework is a whole series of very violent action sequences which are definitely not for the feint of heart. In some places, I thought the violence was a bit overdone. I'm not too fond of lots of impaling. Throughout all sequences are Deadpool's very off-hand and even tongue-in-cheek witticisms. The jokes to the audience made some of the more violent scenes a bit more tolerable but some scenes were quite over the top, particularly the initial action sequence. Still, a relatively original and alternative take on the superhero genre. He even admits at one point he's ""no hero"". No kidding.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
refreshing and different superhero movie,"this isn't your normal x-man spin off, thankfully.There are x-men in it, and it has all the cheesiness of xmen and other superhero movies, but it all made fun off, and using the similar light hearted comedy is mixed in with violence and sex that is definitely not used in those movies, along with some very dark humour, it's so out of place of what you'd expect from these kind of movies that it brings a fresh feel that is such a relief after being drowned in the same stuff of 3 iron man, 7 odd xmen, 5 spiderman, 3 F4, 2 Capt America, Thor, ant man, avengers...Unlike the mentioned above, this isn't one to bring your kids to see, and one of the greatest things about it is that it does stick to many of the rules the above movies follow, but it laughs at them and throws in jokes and scenes that tear those rules apart.If your a fan of super hero movies, watch it, if you hate super hero movies..

"An unexpectedly lousy movie, full of lowbrow ""humor""","I went to see Deadpool with high hopes, particularly since I like Ryan Reynolds and had heard several good reviews. I was not expecting the kind of juvenile humor that I was subjected to for the next 108 minutes. It's the kind of garbage you would find in a bad Jim Carrey movie. I only laughed once during the entire show. Admittedly, I appeared to be in the minority, since other people laughed throughout the movie. I just don't get it.I've seen and enjoyed most of the super hero movies, so I like the genre. However, I don't see the need for an R rated Marvel Comics movie. I found it especially painful to watch Stan Lee's cameo in a strip club with nude women. I would have thought he had better sense.Finally, as most viewers of Marvel Comic adaptations are aware, there is always a snip-it after the credits, to give you a hint of what's coming. This movie has one, but it's not like any of the others, and definitely not worth sitting through the extensive roll of credits to see.

The Perfect Deadpool Movie!,"For 10 long years, fans have been anticipating the possibility of seeing one of the fan- favorite Deadpool on the big screen. There were even times when it seemed like there wouldn't ever bee a Deadpool movie (X-Men Origins Wolverine). However, our prayers have finally been answered, with the arrival of this near perfect Deadpool movie. Let's start with Deadpool himself. In Origins, the couple of scenes that actually featured Ryan Reynolds playing the wise-cracking Deadpool, not the taped mouthed crap, showed that there was definitely potential for the character. Now we finally get to see him in all of his glory, and Ryan Reynolds does an absolute fantastic job of making that happen. Everything about Deadpool from his voice to his reactions, and especially his jokes makes it feel like him and Reynolds are one in the same. This is honestly the best casting of a superhero since Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man. Deadpool also receives a great supporting cast, with Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead being particular standouts. The scenes with these two are honestly some of the funniest, and also poke fun at the X-Men franchise in the best way possible. I don't care what others might say, but Ajax was a great villain. Early on, he proved to be much more lethal than expected, and honestly felt like a threat to Deadpool. The addition of Angel Dust was also a huge plus, as her fight with Colossus was very well done. Finally the best aspect of the movie, the comedy. There might have only been 10 minutes during the whole movie where I was not laughing. Pretty much every joke is spot on with perfect timing, and better yet, the jokes never felt overabundant . The 4th wall breaks were also very effective and well done. I mean by now you must get the point, Deadpool is a hilarious movie. For its budget, production value, and overall objective, Deadpool is literally the perfect movie. It may not have all the flashyness of the other big-budget superhero movies, but it sure matches up to them.

Deadpool,"A former Special Forces operative turned mercenary is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopting the alter ego Deadpool.After a BRILLIANT marketing campaign that set some pretty high expectations, the wait is finally over. The timing of things is perfect, especially with the superheroes overload we are getting lately. I'm not complaining. We like comic book movies, they're fun, but even the most hard core comic book fan can tell you that right now we are oversaturated . Some of them are really good and then we have the Fantastic Four. I was blown away by this film, I loved every minute of it. Coming from someone who didn't know much about Deadpool character, it surprised me in so many ways. It sure as hell beats Kick-Ass and is many, many cuts above Green Lantern. This offshoot of the X-Men series feels like a nasty child next to the shiny delegations of the MCU, as represented by Disney's Avengers franchise and Sony's not-so-amazing Spider Man. This wholesome ""reboot"" pulls off that postmodern trick of getting away with formulas and clichés simply by pointing them out. Deadpool knows what world its in and since it exists within this world, the movie is fully aware of it: self-aware in every way and self-referential. It completely breaks the fourth wall, with its main character looking at the audience and stating something that we are already thinking about in today state of comic book films, this is beautiful.Let's talk about this, as it's easy - especially nowadays - to watch a comic book film and just go like ""OMG! There's so much action and cool stuff, him punching things really hard, I loved it!"" Thats' not what I loved the most about. It's the script. The script is extremely funny. It's a smart structure, one that really sidesteps the major issue with origin stories: the suited up main attraction being mostly absent for the first hour or so. Plus, Wolverine or Superman require something interesting to do - for the most part - but what Deadpool is up to here is less important than the fuss he makes about it and the film still is quite entertaining (a fight, a kidnapping, a rescue attempt and roll credits).For years, Hollywood hasn't known what to do with this ""Sexiest Man Alive"" and his caustic charm. At least in this film they new exactly how to use Ryan Reynolds: an actor whose smooth leading good looking man roles have long disguised one of the sharpest funnyman in the business; as fans of The Proposal, Definitely, Maybe and Just Friends attest. Here he truly has his role of a lifetime, with his mad energy fuelling the film and his likable almost Clooneyesque goofiness. It's not the kind of star profile that immediately screams ""blockbuster"" and Reynolds first appearance as Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) offered sadly little hint of what he could do with the role. Indeed, this film function as a star vehicle for him, demolishing his physical beauty - a small price to pay when an actor's tongue is this gloriously sharp. Though, even with a face that's been horrifically shattered into what his friend likens to the ""offspring of an avocado that had sex with an older avocado"", Ryan Reynolds and his character are a blast of laughing. Giving all these self-referential potty talk a delirious comic momentum. He's at his best as Deadpool, nailing snappy jokes and slaying one liners; weirdly similar to his cousin Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man but with more sugar in the mix. Reynolds genuinely is fun and he seems to enjoy giving the chance to his chimichanga-loving hero the main stage he deserves. His love story with Vanessa (starring Morena Baccarin) doesn't appear like a plot devices at all. They have good chemistry that sells the love story even more, they feel like a real couple who really enjoys each other. Though Ed Skrein does a far better imitation of Jason Statham as this British badass than he managed in The Transporter Refueled, he doesn't look or sound like a proper villain. He looks more like the villain henchman. In fact, that ""British villain"" joke in the opening titles is misleading.

Joy to watch,"Deadpool is Marvel's take on Kill Bill. There's graphic violence, close shots of deadly injuries and a quest for revenge. It's the tone that sets Deadpool apart from your average action movie. The guy's nuts and we love him for it.Right from the opening credits (you will regret skipping them) it's clear Deadpool's not just another superhero movie. It could be argued it's not a superhero movie at all. Deadpool isn't the first anti-hero Marvel's ever produced, but he's certainly the first they've put no filter on. The shooting, stabbing, slashing and ass-kicking is balanced by his absolute determination not to give a f*** and ability to come up with a new sexual innuendo in every scene, making the movie super entertaining. Maybe don't watch it with your in-laws, though.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A Different and Better Kind of Super Hero,"Deadpool (2016)*** 1/2 (out of 4)I'm not sure people need a plot description here but we've basically got a man named Wade Williams (Ryan Reynolds) who comes down with terminal cancer and he accepts a deal to try and have himself cured. The ""doctor"" named Francis (Ed Skrein) instead does a horrible experiment on him and soon the deformed man takes the name Deadpool and goes out for revenge.I'm not a comic book person and I know very little about them outside of what I see in movies. With that said, it seems DEADPOOL got a pretty big group of people who gathered around to say that a R-rated comic book movie would never work and that the studio was committing suicide. Well, the box office numbers certainly proved them wrong as the film managed to take in a lot of money as well as please critics and fans. Personally speaking while most comic book movies are good, they are start to look and sound alike so getting something as fresh as DEADPOOL was terrific.I think the best thing that can be said about the film is that it just stands out among the various other comic movies out there. Naturally the R-rating is the selling point because this ""hero"" loves to cuss, have sex, tell dirty jokes and when he kills someone he wants their brains splattered everywhere. All of this madness is what makes the film seem so fresh because the action scenes are pure 100% action with non-stop bloody violence that is just fun to watch. The comic tone is hilarious at times due to the character's sarcastic nature and dirty mouth. Everything here works extremely well and this includes the real mutants and their super powers. Everything in the film is a joke and what's most shocking is that it's all funny.The casting was certainly the most important thing and Reynolds handles the role with ease. I think it's safe to say after watching the film that they selected the perfect man for the part and can you really think of anyone who would have done it better? Reynold's comic timing is flawless and he really makes Deadpool one of the most memorable characters out there. Skrein is very good in the role as the villain and Morena Baccarin is also very good playing the love interest. Even more great humor comes from T.J. Miller in his role as the comic relief.DEADPOOL certainly earns its R-rating and delivers the goods in terms of dirty laughs and graphic violence. I'm not sure how many other comic book movies are going to be willing to do this but this certainly stands out from the crowd and best of all is that the dirty humor isn't just a gimmick because it actually works very well.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Good,"This film is pretty good . It is diffrent from what we have seen so far in marvel's movies , and tells us the plot of movie from the deadpool's perspective .It made me laugh a few times and I have to say that Rahyan Reinolds acts deadpool as best as possible because of all the hymor , the action scenes , and the way he talks to the movie audience.However , the story is full of sexual scenes , which I didn't like and caused me enjoy the movie less than I expected . I thought they could have added more action scenes insead of that .Moreover , the villain wasn't pretty good beacause of the reason that he wasn't being developed throughout the movie , as well as the girl who worked with Colosus and had only few action scenes in end of movie .In conclusion , the movie is worthwacthing and really gonna make those who like it's houmor laugh .",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A truly fun flick,"Greetings from Lithuania.If you are tired of all Marvel Capt. America type of superhero flicks, ""Deadpool"" (2016) offers probably the best antidote imaginable. The movie itself is one very fun ride, which (finally!) doesn't take itself to seriously, and mocks everything and everyone - and does this truly funny. It's is rated R but it is not gore fest, back in the 80's and 90's R rated movies were much, much bloodier.Overall, ""Deadpool"" is a one highly enjoyable ride. At running time 1 h 40 min it runs smoothly and almost every scene has something more interesting to offer then your average one in a year Marvel movie flick. Thank god this one wasn't made by them, because we wouldn't have this bold and highly unpredictable (in the way it flows) picture. And while the true Marvel fans could be left disappointed that it doesn't play by their fan boys rules, everyone else will be highly entertained.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One of two ways modern comicbook-based movies *should* go,"Review by someone who is not a comic book fan.Deadpool is really funny and it is really meta-. It is not just meta- it is meta-meta; like the titular character says at one point, it doesn't just break the proverbial fourth wall, but a wall within that wall.Deadpool is also silly and it is fully aware of that silliness. It is written to feel like every choice in the script that remains faithful to comic book hero conventions is a fully conscious and somewhat ironic one.That said, there's still a decent plot (barring the pretty basic/unremarkable bad guy) and, somehow, we can still feel for the main characters and root for their romance.Coming back to my review title: I think this is a comic book adaptation done right. It's inventive, non-generic, and non-boring. With such an abundance of blockbuster adaptations nowadays, it's really hard to find one that stands out and doesn't just follow a recipe and the beaten path. It's even harder to find one that will appeal to an audience that likes cinema without being particularly interested in comic books and would like to see something more substantial than a generic action movie. I think the purely comedic and ironic take of Deadpool manages all that. I also think it's the only option to making great comic book adaptations, other than the gritty, dark, and realistic style that works so well in ""Logan"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Deadpool is redeemed!!!!,"This is going to be the kind of film that gets better with every watch. Some jokes I almost didn't catch and considering how many subtle touches there are I'm sure there are things that blew right past me. Good thing I intend to rewatch it over and over again. I have to be honest and say some jokes didn't land with me because I'd heard them a hundred times in the trailers. But don't for a second think the best jokes were wasted. The humor evolves throughout the film; waking you up during the opening credits, and building from there as you jump back and forth between the love struck Wade Wilson and the post ""cancer cure"" Wade Wilson. This style of story telling worked really well in terms of giving us lots of bang for our buck evenly across all three acts while still being able to tell us what we need to know about Deadpool's ""origin"".Ryan Reynolds makes this film. TJ Miller is kind of just TJ Miller, which is usually fine because no one's better at being TJ Miller than TJ Miller but as a really big fan of Weasel (yes such a thing exists) I was disappointed that writing wise they sidelined his canon purpose in Deadpool's life, but I have to be fair and say the changes worked for the story. I couldn't get enough of Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, and Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead was so damn cool and we better get more of her in this universe!But back to Ryan Reynolds. Not only was he born to play this part but thank the film gods that he was a producer. When that was announced shortly after the test footage leak I was so relieved. Deadpool is mostly masked for the film, and what a joy it is to see the scarred comic nut job come to life on screen.I had people in my group who weren't at all familiar with Deadpool before this and it was fun to hear them enjoy the film and talk about it afterwards with lots of praise and energy.

Deadcool!,"""Deadpool"" is a unique superhero film with a unique superhero. Ryan Reynolds stars as Wade Wilson, the former quarterback of the Minnesota Vikings; oops, wrong Wade Wilson.

Wilson then takes an opportunity from an underground group that promises him that they can cure his cancer and give him superpowers. I know that most of America, and the World for that matter, has seen this movie; but in order not to be in the spoilerpool , I will not divulge more on the plot. I do have to tell you that because of Wilson's dilemma, arises Deadpool. Writers Rhett Reese and Pauk Wernick did go into their pool of witty zingers to deliver to Deadpool's witty verbal attack. Director Tim Miller did pull through with some nicely orchestrated sequences, but at times did get trapped into the formulaic ""bang bang"" superhero scenic action. Reynolds was the superhero of ""Deadpool""; his performance was superb. So if you haven't already, take a dip in the ""Deadpool"". **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"A cheeky, funny and hugely entertaining superhero parody","Now that it's one of the most successful R-Rated movies of all time, and has started a new wave of comic book movies targeted at the older crowd (such as ""Logan""), there is little doubt that Deadpool will be a cult classic in the future. So is it as good as you've heard? In spite of a few reservations... yes, it largely is. Right off the bat, Ryan Reynolds is the key to its success. His performance is a perfect match for the character of Deadpool, and is among the best portrayals of a comic book character on screen of all time. It's easy to see why he got a Golden Globe nomination. Still, not everything works. There's a little too much time spent on the origin story, and the villains are too weak. You get the impression that they're meant to be parodies of generic movie villains, but there's nothing particularly memorable about them, save for a few good scenes. This leads to a finale that isn't quite as subversive or clever as the rest of the film. Now, back to the positives. The action is stylish, particularly in the opening scene, and the jokes are mostly hilarious. Sure, some of them are a little crude, but whether it's breaking the fourth wall or poking fun at past X-Men movies, the gags Land more often than not. Overall, in spite of some shortcomings, Deadpool is a blast for comic book fans, and Ryan Reynolds is perfect as the title character. Looking forward to Deadpool 2!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The story is a bit on the thin side but the character of Deadpool and the generally humorous tone adopted more than compensates for its shortcomings,"Former Special Forces Operative Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) takes part in a rogue experiment which on the flip side gives him the ability to heal rapidly, but on the downside this experiment leaves with permanent and unsightly scarring to his entire body. When Wilson is left for dead by Ajax (Ed Skrein) after the experiment has been completed, Wilson makes it his mission to gain revenge on Ajax and becomes Deadpool - Wilson's masked alter-ego.Within the first few minutes of this film I had an inkling that I was going to like it. The opening credits are amusing and quite imaginative; I particularly loved the Directed By 'An Overpaid Tool' caption.The opening segment of the film where we're introduced to Deadpool - the fast-talking crazed anti-hero are probably some of the best moments in the film and Reynolds is clearly at his best in this film when he becomes Deadpool. I have to be honest and admit that I did find it a bit jarring when the film cuts to the 'origin story' which ultimately took on a much more serious tone. This isn't a bad thing as the 'origin story' was interesting enough, but I still found it a bit of a shock to my system at first due to how impressive and explosive the opening few minutes of the film were.The story itself is rather weak and in some ways it seems ironic that the film spends so much time sending itself up and making fun of itself only to then have a rather clichéd and predictable plot line and outcome. The turn of events in the final third aren't bad and there are still plenty of amusing moments, but given the fact that it seemed to have some imagination to it I just expected a bit more that's all.Another slight problem with this film lies with Wade Wilson; although he is an anti-hero when he becomes Deadpool he is also an anti-hero when he is Wade Wilson himself. The problem is that before he becomes Deadpool he isn't a particularly likable person and I did feel that sometimes he got what he deserved. This, in some ways, made him a rather unlikeable character (pre-accident) meaning that it was harder to get behind him when he became his alter-ego. I personally feel that a good anti-hero should have some likability or a reason to root for them in order to be successful and I never really felt that way about Deadpool or Wade Wilson, but like I said the sense of fun that the film brings means that these things don't cause that much of a problem.That being said though, when Reynolds is Deadpool this film never lets up and is an absolute blast to watch. The sending up and parodying that it offers is imaginative and very funny. The fourth wall stuff is pretty amusing - although it does get a bit repetitive. If you liked Kick-Ass then I think that this film will be right up your street. Therefore despite a thin story and a rather flawed protagonist, this film is funny, imaginative and self-aware enough to more than compensate for its very minor shortcomings and is something that I would highly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Outrageous,"Remove this film's attitude and you have a structurally interesting, bare bones, and serviceable origin story of a super, well, super action personality with comic book origins. The attitude is really what carries it from beginning to end, and that attitude is almost all about Ryan Reynolds as the titular character. Reynolds takes the Merc with the Mouth from the comic book to the silver screen with a rapid fire set of quips that sometimes become quite witty from time to time that elevates the pedestrian origin story into a solidly entertaining one.Ignoring the original appearance of Wade Wilson and Deadpool from X-Men Origins: Wolverine (a wise decision), we start the movie with the fully formed Deadpool waiting on an overpass for some cars to pass by containing his nemesis, Francis. The first half of the movie is told in flashback intercut with the action scene that follows where Deadpool jumps down onto the car, crashes it, gets into a shootout with the survivors, and then is derailed just before he's going to exact his justice upon Francis by the arrival of two minor X-Men, Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Francis gets away, Deadpool cuts off his own hand to get away from the X-Men, and the movie just plays it straight for the rest of the way. Well, as straight as a movie like this can play it.I think the first half's structure is meant to mesh well with Wade Wilson's nearly constant voiceover, and that's true. The carefree attitude that Wilson so obviously embodies works in conjunction with the more chaotic storytelling devices. The flashbacks are never confusing, and there's a solidly straightforward story being told, it's just told in flashbacks, and I wonder if it would work better told straight. As it is, the extended look at the highway fight almost feels like it's stretching out its welcome after a certain point, especially once he gets Francis (and before we actually know who Francis is). However, the point really is Wade Wilson's attitude.He was a foul-mouthed mercenary who discovered his dream girl in Vanessa, a perfect comic/movie creation of a woman who can dish out Star Wars references, is as depraved sexually as Wade himself, and loves him completely. When Wade gets diagnosed with multiple forms of cancer, she stays by his side faithfully and fully until he abandons her to pursue a radical treatment from a shadowy organization. In comes Francis who runs this shadowy organization that injects a serum into its patients, tortures them to try and trigger a mutation, and then sells the subjects with a control collar to the highest bidder. Wade won't shut his mouth, though, and he receives particular odious treatment from Francis (who is ashamed of his own name that Wade figures out through a dry cleaning slip). The mutation allows Wade to heal like Wolverine, but it's slower and he gets horribly disfigured in the process. When he escapes, he makes it his mission to kill Francis for what he had done to him. Hence, the action scene that all of this has been interspersed with all of this.The second half of the movie is much more straightforwardly built with Wade going back home to his duplex with his blind old lady roommate as he waits for his hand to grow back. Okay, more straightforward for this movie. Wade has to regain his focus and his ability to face Vanessa who thinks that he's dead. When he finally walks up to her place of work to let her know that he's still alive, though, Francis has figured out her connection to Wade and kidnapped her, forcing the final act confrontation. Wade recruits Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead to fight with him, and there's a lot of special effects before the good guy wins the day by shooting the bad guy in the head point blank while the bad guy lays helpless on the ground. Okay, good guy is a bit relative.See? It's super straightforward stuff. What really makes it fun is Ryan Reynolds as Wade. Ryan Reynolds is a funny guy, and he carries this movie with energy and humor. His one-liners are rapid fire and come so fast that if one misses there's another one coming along to hit in a few seconds. He's a solid enough actor that he can convincingly give us the handful of small emotional moments required of him, but mostly he's there to shout obscenities and make quips. Your enjoyment of the film is really going to entirely hinge on how much of Ryan Reynolds' humor you can take, and I find it quite enjoyable. He's funny, not the funniest guy in the world and his stuff is rather scattershot, but it's enough to take what would be a moderately entertaining origin story and elevate it to solidly entertaining origin story.I've certainly seen far worse, and this actually ends up representing one of the great strengths of ubiquitous franchise filmmaking. When everything has to be part of a brand for financial reasons, it opens up different kinds of films within a certain context to audiences. Not everything needs to be big ensemble pieces like most of the X-Men movies. They don't have to all be dark and serious like the DCEU. They don't have to all be bright and lightly entertaining like most of the MCU. They can be immature and vulgar as well. This helped push the boundaries of franchise filmmaking a bit (Logan's mere existence owes almost everything to Deadpool's financial success), and that's a good thing. That the movie ends up a fun 100 minutes is a bonus, I guess.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Gotta be a better way to rate this,"I watched this today and had a good time. It wasn't really more or less than I expected. Top 250 quality? Hmmm... iffy.

I thought the pacing was good except for the sex/romance scenes. There were some funny moments, but it dragged sometimes there and felt too much like movies from around 1980 where sex was inserted whether you liked it or not.

I can appreciate bawdy humor, but that's the stuff for grownups.)For the most part, the writing is good. Characters are fun. Opening scene is very creative. CGI is what I expected.

The perfect combination of action and comedy!,"'DEADPOOL': Five Stars (Out of Five)A raunchy, and excessively violent, superhero comedy flick; based on the Marvel Comics character (of the same name). The film stars Ryan Reynolds; playing a very different version of the role, than he previously did (in 2009's 'X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE'). Reynolds plays a mercenary, named Wade Wilson, who's subjected to a secret experiment (to cure his cancer); which gives him superhuman healing powers, but it also leaves him severely scarred. The movie also stars Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T.J. Miller, Gina Carano, Brianna Hildebrand and the voice of Stefan Kapicic (as Colossus). It was directed by first time feature filmmaker Tim Miller; and written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (based on the comic book character, created by Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza). The film scored the biggest R-rated opening of all-time, at the Box-Office (grossing $150 million, in 4 days); making it (also) one of the largest superhero film debuts, ever (beating the likes of 'SPIDER-MAN', 'BATMAN', 'SUPERMAN', 'IRON MAN' and more)!Wade Wilson (Reynolds) is a former Special Forces operative, turned mercenary for hire, who suddenly falls in love with a beautiful escort, named Vanessa Carlysle (Baccarin); after meeting her at a local New York City bar. Then he's tragically diagnosed with terminal cancer. A mysterious recruiter (Jed Rees), for a special program, approaches Wade (at the bar he frequents); and offers him a cure for cancer (in exchange for his involvement in the program). Wislon reluctantly accepts his proposal; but the program not only cures him of his deadly disease, but it mutates him into a scarred, and somewhat psychotic, superhero, as well (with the nickname Deadpool). Deadpool will stop at nothing to get revenge, on the people that mutated him, and (hopefully) fix his disfigured face; so he can go home to Vanessa, again.The movie is the perfect combination of action and comedy; It's a hilarious (fourth wall breaking) spoof, and the action scenes are spectacular (and thrilling) as well. The special effects aren't bad either. I'd give it 5 stars, in both genres; which I never really thought was possible, before now. Reynolds is perfect, as the popular antihero; and it's such a redeeming, faithful adaptation (this time around). The writing is brilliant, and the directing is equally impressive (from a debut filmmaker even). The movie also has great social commentary, on most people's obsession with looks, in our society (Deadpool is insanely driven by this motivation). The film is also one of my new all-time favorite superhero flicks; and I hope they make a lot more R-rated comic book movies, like it, due to it's success!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/0d1sap746-M",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Not your typical superhero movie,"Deadpool is the 7th film in the X-Men franchise released in 2016. Its the first R-rated X-Men movie. Technically Deadpool was a low-budget movie; its budget was lower than any MCU film. Well, I went to see the movie with high expectations following all the promotional campaign and trailers. And it didn't disappoint me. Right from the opening credits scene, it showed its biggest weapon: humor and violence. Deadpool was hilarious, foul-mouthed, fun, 4th-wall breaker and Amaaziing. It was really fun to watch. The action scenes were great considering the film's low budget. Ryan Reynolds is perfect as Deadpool and the film addresses many things too. The romantic aspect of the film is better than many superhero movies and the storytelling is inventive. The film did the right thing: stick to the source. But it wasn't perfect; The villain could have been more memorable in this revenge story from both sides film.

A much-needed fresh and funny take on an anti-hero,"3.5/4The X-Men universe needed a fun superhero movie... After 6 X-Men movies focused on a hardened Magneto and a deliberate Charles Xavier, Deadpool was the least the franchise could do to keep your attention for another movie. It simultaneously provided Ryan Reynolds with his first good role as a comic-book character.Deadpool is the unlikely hero who'd defy all of the pre-set ""hero"" stereotypes: He can get the job done, but still chooses to carry himself like a kid. He's a good person at heart, but has an arsenal of R-rated humor to dispense at a moments notice. At the same time, he can present a more mature, dark theme and take himself seriously.What makes Deadpool great is his flexibility as a character. Whenever the movie takes a carefree or silly turn, it doesn't saturate the more intense, emotionally driven sequences (and vice versa). Deadpool truly has a plot, an issue, and a resolution. However, it's not scared to take you on too fun a ride replete with comic-book violence and profanity-laced hilarity.I am thoroughly pleased with Deadpool, as it showed that even the most morally-flexible of us can be a hero in our own right. He doesn't settle for light-hearted or heavy-handed, and he knows how to please the crowds...",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Long awaited Van Wilder Sequel continues the tradition,"Snarky, sarcastic, inappropriate, mildly racist Van Wilder is back and he's able to regenerate body parts (it's unclear whether he's immortal - would he eventually die of old age?). In this super rough, hard-R, cape-and-tights comic saga, the implausible combination of pretty and muscular Ryan Reynolds kills 90 people (by his count) and yet somehow is the titular hero. By comparison, Ajax (the name ""Mr. Clean"" was copyrighted), the main baddie only tortures people (who did, after all, come to him) and puts damsels in distress. The movie mixes ranch comedy with torture porn and Reservoir Dogs type violence into a volatile concoction that will have many of the millions who bought tickets leaving the theater early. While clever at times - particularly any time T.J. Miller is on the screen - the movie has only a nominal plot centered around Deadpool's mostly uninteresting and unlikely origin story (couldn't the techniques be refined to produce mutants with superheroes on an industrial scale; sure the process is painful but so is cosmetic surgery and people line up for that?) . Ryan - presumably stepping in for a part written for Jim Carey - presents another major issue mostly around the fact that his handsomeness is so overwhelming that the latex mask he wears still leaves him more attractive than your high school prom date. Also, note to the special effects team, ever time Reynolds turned his head right or left, the mask bunched and gaped like a 60's creature feature. In short, a mess but an entertaining and sometimes witty one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Best Marvel film to date,"As an old comics nerd, I was highly skeptical about a Marvel film featuring a hero who did not exist in the golden era of the 70's. My daughter had to drag me to the screening. But what I found was nothing short of miraculous. We laughed almost nonstop from the opening credits to the post-closing-credits teaser. Delicious millennial irony, 4th wall- breaking comic commentary, outstanding effects, rapid-fire dialog as compelling as the sophisticated comedies of the '30's, white knuckle action scenes, and maybe the best opening credits sequence in film history.For all the negative reviews, I get it. I can see why you disliked the film. But friends, you missed the point. Give it another try, take off the blinders, and approach it like a roller coaster. Enjoy the ride.

It's an OK movie - a little original but not much,"It was an OK movie. The dialogue was the best. The plot was a boring, standard revenge plot. The story telling was very unique. The scope of the movie was small - it all took place in one city. The characterization was poor. Many of the characters were flat, their motivation was unexplained, and some were even one-dimensional - just placeholders. The main character was OK though. By the way, Deadpool has an ENTP Myers-Briggs personality type. His friend, TJ Miller, who also plays Erlich Bachman in Silicon Valley, is also an ENTP. Rick Sanchez from Rick & Morty is also an ENTP. I don't mind the R rating, but it had very little adult concepts. Rick & Morty has more adult themes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

The jokes are too simple or only about sex, script lacks any point and the biggest plot twist was that there is no plot twist... maybe except for really ""unexpectable"" revelation that there is no cure for such problem as is ugliness.

Ryan Reynolds portrays Deadpool perfectly,"If you did not like or enjoy this movie, then it is quite clear that you went to the movie not knowing who Deadpool is, not having researched the character at all, or you did not see any of the advertisements for the movie. Deadpool's character is a ""merc with a mouth,"" which means he is going to curse and say sarcastic things at every turn. It would be like going to see ""The Punisher"" in theaters and being upset that he maimed people or seeing ""Spider-man"" and saying it was boring because all he did was shoot webs. The character is who the character is. If you do not like the character, you will not like the movie. My suggestion is to research your superhero characters before seeing the movie so you know what to expect. Ryan Reynolds perfectly portrayed the Deadpool from the comics, video games, and cartoons.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Full of Shits and Giggles,I went to watch this at the movies for my husband's birthday and it was hilarious. The movie theater was full but everyone respected the film and was quiet except when you couldn't help but laugh. I had never really heard of Deadpool before the movie so I can't comment on the movie compared to the comics but I hope there are more movies to come. Ryan Reynolds owned the character and I'm glad he was able to leave the green suit behind. Definitely don't take the kids or watch with your parents. I can't really remember ever being bored and thinking the film was too long or too short so that's also a plus. I would probably buy this and watch when I'm bored.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Deadpool Review,Not going to bother doing a long paragraph for this review but I have to write a review for this movie.At first I was aware that when I first hear of Deadpool was from the comics and I've only seen like a few panels not entirely the whole comic. I actually thought he looked a bit similar to Spiderman because of it's whole red costume and especially the white eyes. This is probably the best marvel movie ever so far because of it's humor and the differences in heroes in the Marvel Industry. Not those mainstream cheesy ones and with humor in it is what makes the movie extremely unique. 10/10. Would recommend this movie.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"The best superhero movie since ""Guardians of the Galaxy""","The superhero movie has become stale as of late. 2015 didn't do much for the genre, as its most notable entry was ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" which was a serviceable film at best. The genre suffers because of its formulaic core. Marvel can make a billion dollars off of pretty much anything these days, so they have little incentive to mix it up. The mold has been perfected in terms of box office success, and with it, originality has taken a fatal blow. ""Deadpool,"" however, doesn't fit into this mold, or any other for that matter, and that's why it's the best superhero movie to be released since ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014).""Deadpool"" follows Wade Wilson (played by Ryan Reynolds), a mercenary-for-hire that kicks the mess out of people for a living. After being diagnosed with terminal cancer, Wilson signs on to an experimental program that will cure his cancer and allow him to happily live out his days with his girlfriend. This program isn't what it seems, however, and Wilson emerges from the torturous experimentation mutated, disfigured and super powered. With his newfound abilities, Wilson christens himself Deadpool and goes on the path of revenge.From the first frame of the opening credits, it's clear that ""Deadpool"" is unlike every other superhero movie that came before it. Its ""hero"" isn't really much of a hero at all. He's prone to profanity, innuendo and brutal violence, most of which is done with relative taste.Anyone who's been on the Internet in the last month has surely seen some trace of the film's pervasive marketing campaign, most of which asserts the obnoxious humor characteristic of Deadpool himself. Initially, this worried me. I was afraid I'd be subjected to several hours of lowbrow, pre-pubescent humor, and although there was certainly plenty of that strewn throughout, it wasn't nearly as idiotic as I anticipated. Certainly not all of the ridiculous one-liners connect, but a surprising number of them stick the landing.In fact, most of ""Deadpool"" is genuinely hilarious. The film is insanely self-aware and, much like the comic books from which it came, it often breaks the fourth wall, addressing the audience directly just for the laughs. It plays off the absurdity of its genre's formula with refreshing effectiveness, using the tired tropes of superhero flicks to its advantage. However, much of this breaks down into a matter of taste regardless. For some people, ""Deadpool"" with be a humorless excursion into immaturity. But for those unburdened by seriousness, this film is a riot.However violent it may be, there's an honesty to be found amidst the carnage. Films like ""The Avengers"" (2012) deal with apocalyptic destruction that surely leaves hundreds of thousands dead, but the audience is never exposed to any of that. We've seen Iron Man save the day countless times, blasting his enemies to bits with his array of billion-dollar technology, but we're never shown the reality of his actions. Sure, he saved New York from an alien invasion, but half the city was destroyed in the process. Almost all superhero movies deal in this kind of flashy, soft-core violence.""Deadpool,"" on the other hand, shows us exactly what its hero is all about. Wielding twin katanas, Wilson cuts through swathes of his enemies, separating limb from torso, head from spine and ego from spirit. He's a killer, like most superheroes, but at least he's sincere about it. Characters like Wolverine have power sets that are entirely based in visceral dismemberment, and yet they're dressed up on screen as if the kills are somehow clean. ""Deadpool"" and its title character are much more honest.Any complaints made about the film's lack of plot or original characters are based in misunderstanding. The villain, for example, is an intentional cliché that's carefully crafted to reflect the tiresome habits of action movies everywhere right back into Hollywood's face. The plot is bare bones, lacking in any global-scale destruction or international crises, which is refreshing when considering the fact that the earth has come close to annihilation in nearly every other superhero movie. ""Deadpool"" knows precisely what it's doing with its own elements. It's all very intentional; it's just a matter of whether or not you like its intention.But this film has done more than provide us with an entertaining way to spend two hours. ""Deadpool"" has proved that there's a place for R-rated superhero movies in today's market. It's taken what ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" started and expanded on it, proving that the mold isn't the only way for studios to make money. Hopefully, this film's success will inspire future installments in the superhero genre to think outside the box.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
yes its stupid but its enjoyable,If you compare this to other DC and Marvel films Deadpool is not an outstanding film yes it does have some scenes that are Offinece and rude and Racist but its not that bad of for an anti hero film here are some of the things that I did and did not like about this film. 1. some scenes are rather inaporepet at times which could of been cut out of the film and be an bonus feather on the DVD and Blu ray release. 2. I think the film is a bit overrated giving it an 8.2 on IMDb I think at least give it an 7.3 instead just because some of the sexual scenes are a bit too much.I do like this movie as it is one of my favorite SCIF but The sex scenes where a bit too muchoverall its a great film if you don't take it too seriously 7/10,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
As Meta As Meta Can Meta,"Do you love taking the younger nerds in your life to see each new superhero movie? Of course you do! But for the love of God, do NOT take any kids to Deadpool, the most recent entry to the ""X-Men"" cinematic cosmos. Ryan Reynold's affectionate take on this C-level Marvel anti-hero fills a massive hole in the ubiquitous world of superhero films: fanboy fiction for proudly immature adults. A no-holds-barred, Guardians of the Galaxy-esque romp, it's gleefully violent and unabashedly debauched. Deadpool serves as proof that true passion projects are sometimes worth backing. Unfamiliar with the Deadpool character? No problem. The film catches us up to speed with some unique origin story-telling, jumping back and forth between his present crime-fighting life and his past normal life. It's a gloriously messy way to breathe some life into a clichéd story form. All the while, meta-references and in-jokes burst from every blood-splattered shot, starting with a wonderful opening credit sequence that features self-mutilating gags (i.e. referring to Ryan Reynolds as ""God's Perfect Idiot""). Reynolds, a guy often overly interested frat-boy shenanigans, revels and shines in a role he was clearly born to play. And hopefully this won't be his last time donning the red-tights and foul-mouth. If done correctly, the sequels have the strong possibility of only being better than this first one, as the setup of the character can be lost to more frivolous fun. How will this strongly R-rated character get tied into the larger X-Men story without losing his bite? Not sure; for now let's just enjoy this one-shot action-comedy as a one-of-a-kind superhero experience that you've likely never experienced before.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Simply enjoy this movie for what it is. And it is a gamechanger,"After months of all kinds of trailers, posters and tireless social media promotion, Deadpool is finally in the cinemas. To be completely honest it is everything it promises to be. What was obvious at a first glance is that this movie is different from usual superhero stuff we see almost every month. in fact,this movie should not be called a superhero movie,nor antihero movie. Why so? Deadpool (aka Wade Wilson),famously proclaimed as the Merc With The Mouth, is actually a really cool guy in a red suit. His role is not saving the world (or city) from an alien threat. He is a man on a mission but one that is more about himself than benefiting society. But as we all know it his most noticeable feature is his wit and there are tons of that throughout 105 minutes.Giving 9/10 is giving this movie a considerable weight and I was inclined to give it 8. Why didn't I? Because I simply enjoyed the movie,had many laughs and loved action scenes (which were kinda pretentious and over-pumped,but who really cares). As far as I am concerned that is mission accomplished.This movie definitely could have had more use of its plot. It is decent at its best and comparable to many other Marvel movies. As you can now guess the villain (played by Ed Skrein) is not that interesting and magnetic and gets completely overshadowed by somewhat egoistic main character. Those are some serious drawbacks but they are sacrificed for the best thing about this movie. It is bringing freshness to a bit mundane superhero world. Now,you don't really watch what he is doing next but how he is doing it. For once you get not only to love a titular character but you are ready to let him entertain you for an hour and a half.So is this is just an action comedy? You can put it that way,but it is difficult to really define it. This movie simply exists in its own universe,and it does it so effortlessly. And it deserves a massive applause for that",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Breaking all the walls,"It's been said of ""The Howard Stern Show"" that it appeals exclusively to the very stupid and the very smart. The same could be said of ""Deadpool,"" albeit with a narrower spectrum, trimmed at the latter end.Deadpool is unique among his superhero brethren, in that he's quite aware of his status as a fictional character--there's an existential crisis in that sentence somewhere. He is constantly playing to the audience, whether it be moving the camera to save his viewers from witnessing the coming violence, or shamelessly mocking his own genre--Hugh Jackman jokes aplenty; digs at the lack of financial support from Fox. As a character, Deadpool strips away all the respect and pretension that his compatriots have worked so long to receive.Unfortunately, Deadpool's impish presence doesn't bleed over into the narrative itself, which is the usual superhero fare of initially horrid transformations, lost lovers and the sweet revenge that caps it all off. While these steps are taken with an abnormal--but welcome-- amount of sardonicism and waggishness, it wasn't enough to grab my interest--merely tapping it on the shoulder and inquiring whether or not it's free for the next couple of hours, to which my interest declines, having been burned before. However, the disjointed structure of the film works in its favor, turning the dull bits into fleeting detours. In other words, anytime Wade Wilson isn't in the suit, the movie suffers.As far as the comedy goes, I respected the air of contempt more than the jokes themselves, which, more often than not, are foul balls. And Deadpool's ""creative 15-year-old who doesn't apply himself"" vocabulary becomes grating over time. There are a few winners however:--Deadpool informs a blind woman that 150 kilos of cocaine are buried somewhere in her house, as well as the cure to blindness.--When Colossus is going to take Deadpool to Professor Xavier and Deadpool replies: ""McAvoy or Stewart?""--The black knight scene--a tried and true gag.--The baby hand.The broadly talentless Ryan Reynolds--Deadpool said it, not me-- needs to hold on to this character like his career depends on it, because it does. Just as Downey Jr. has realized--failing financially and critically in anything where he doesn't where an iron suit--Reynolds needs Deadpool more than Deadpool needs him.I'm looking forward to the sequel, in which Deadpool fights his greatest foil, Kirk Douglas.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

This film was everything I expected and more. Childish but hilarious jokes. Breaking the fourth wall also worked incredibly for this film. The action sequences were fun and enjoyable.

"Funny, Gore & Naughty Deadpool","I went for this movie with high expectations after watching the trailers and the mini trailers plus the trust in Ryan Reynolds Well the movie opened with title credits which is very new to me and was very much impressive. Then continues with an amazing stunt which was totally good. Well, then i thought, WoW Marvel is not going to follow their typical chick flick superhuman movies. Story revolves around a navy returned wade Wilson who works as a mercenary in New York city. He founds his love interest from a bar and started to live peacefully. But fate struck him in the form of cancer. An agent approaches him to recruit for his secret organization that will give mutant abilities and he accepts the offer. But during the process he was disfigured and he calls himself as dead pool and takes the revenge on the organization forms the crux of the story. Dialogues, action sequences, comedy, one liner punches, scenes, background score, Ryan Reynolds of course with an ensemble cast are the positives of the movie.

So this guy in the red suit came and broke some records...,"I was not a Deadpool fan and I'm still not, but like any superhero films I'd pleasure watching it. The other reason was, we had other superheroes in our time, so this guy is kind of new to me. It was a stunning launch to the big screen for the Deadpool as well as for this new director. This film was merely an introduction tale than a fully stretched story. Like how a human becomes a mutant and later who seeks a revenge for ruining his natural life. But it yet to explain a couple of things and I hope it all will be revealed in its sequel.I am happy for Ryan Reynolds to get another chance, because his previous comic book character did not received well. I certainly liked the film, but nowadays there are plenty of superheroes to choose, in that, Deadpool's not in my top 5. So I am happy he joined the 'X- Men', because I never liked the boring 'X-Men' films or its characters, but I do love its spin off 'Wolverine'. I'll definitely look forward for his solo films like 'Wolverine'.This film broke a few records like the best box office so far for an 'X-Men' installment. A short film with the present and flashback narration shared the screen piece by piece alternatively. This was a strong R rated film so far I have seen in a superhero theme and there were plenty of other films referred. No offense to the people who liked it (and those who are going watch will do the same), but in my personal opinion it was a bit over-celebrated.6½/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
So impressed by how amazing Deadpool is and how dead on they got him.,"It's the first really good movie of 2016, and the perfect film to knock Star Wars out of the IMAX theaters.An Action Comedy like no other, though it's not the first superhero movie to be given an R Rating (Blade) it does take the concept to a new level. This is not a soft R rating, it's a hard R Rating filled with everything I love: vulgar humor, gory action and unnecessary (but always enjoined) nudity. Disney will never give you a flick like this in their version of the Marvel cinematic Universe, it's a XXX-Men event going on here.Ryan Reynolds reprises his extended cameo from X-Men Origins: Wolverine as Wade Wilson, an talkative mercenary diagnosed with terminal cancer, who becomes a lab rat to get a cure, that instead triggers his dormant mutant abilities to repair any part of his body that gets damaged, but left his body looking like crap.The movie starts with a bang, opening up with awesome crazy credits that make fun of superhero movie stereotypes (the movie stars a Hollywood Asshat, a hot chick, a British villain and a CGI character and directed by a guy getting paid too much). Then goes into one of the most fast pace action sequences I've seen in a while, and the whole time, Deadpool is shelling out some of the most hilarious one- liners.The momentum never stops, even when they do the flashbacks that tell Wade Wilson's origin story and the love story between him and Vanessa, the girl he has to save from the British villain (and never uses her mutant abilities from the comic).Deadpool is so funny, that I have to go back and see it again cause The audience was laughing so hard I missed a joke or two. It's so action packed with mindless bloody violence too. You don't get to see stuff like this anymore.I knew I would like this movie, but I impressed with how much I loved it.

Just so you know that I'm not a total prude, I can accept all of these in story lines where they make sense in context.

"Good, wholesome fun and entertainment...","Normally I am not overly keen on superhero movies, but all that I know who have seen ""Deadpool"" has been overly excited and thrilled about it, so I decided to cave in an give it a go, and check if it really was as fun and entertaining as everyone said it was.And they were right! Wow, ""Deadpool"" is a fantastic combination of action, comedy, satire and spoofs. The story in the movie is fairly straight forward, actually bordering on being generic. But it was the sly remarks, the physical comedy of the Wade/Deadpool character that really made the movie work out so nicely. And Ryan Reynolds, despite already having played other superhero roles, really was nicely cast for the Deadpool character.The audience is thrown into the fray right from the very beginning, and the movie kicks up into an impressive gear and high speed from the very start, and it never slows down.The cast in ""Deadpool"" were doing some good jobs with their given roles and characters. And I must admit that I was more than genuinely impressed with what Ryan Reynolds (playing Wade / Deadpool) managed to deliver with his part in this movie. But also Morena Baccarin (playing Vanessa) really brought something good to the movie with her skills and on-screen charisma. And T.J.

Good potential let down by questionable scripting...,"There's a lot to like about Deadpool. It has a good cast, humour and action. What is lacks, is a good script.Ryan Reynolds is perfectly cast as Deadpool. Comedy is where Reynold's shines and this film is as much a showpiece for his off the wall, politically incorrect and often ribald comedic talents, as much as it is an action film. The jokes can be crude but they are well timed and often, rather clever.The action scenes are not half bad either.They also mix in gallows humour that works well in the context of this film. Where Deadpool suffers, is in the scripting/storytelling department. The incessant oscillation between past and present, disrupts the natural flow established early in the film. The result is an annoying experience, where you start to buy into the storyline only to have it broken again and again by uncomfortable segues into Deadpools past.Worse still, the background scenes presented are often emotionally sugary, drawn out and frankly, at times, rather boring. This film, would have been much better served by getting the background out of the way, up front and in a more abbreviated fashion.The Deadpool franchise shows promise. It would be nice to see a second film that's more focused on Reynolds humour and the jokery action scenes, as these elements really define the Deadpool, anti-hero character.

I can see why Fox never wanted to film this,"The most misogynistic of all of Marvel's characters. I can see why Fox never wanted to film it. The script is loaded with sexist, borderline racist, pseudo-intellectual drivel (obscure pop cultural references are stupid, not smart). Why the hell would a middle-aged, disabled, African American woman put up with Ryan Reynold's arrogant white frat boy stupidity? My first reaction to seeing him lean on Big Al's shoulder was to punch his head. In Deadpool's world there are two types of women. The first is like his real life wife (Blake Lively)--the ""good woman""--thin, anxious, insecure, helpless, religiously adheres to the trappings of traditional womanhood, and lives only to make sure her boyfriend/husband doesn't leave her by crowning him the center of her universe. Then there are all the other women--the lesbian, the un-feminine, the older woman, the strong/violent woman, the woman that has other priorities than to run around pleasing men like it's the sole purpose of her existence (reality check: most women have a heckuvalot more problems and responsibilities in life than to run in circles trying to make some guy happy--it's adolescent male arrogance to assume otherwise). These are the ""inappropriate"" women and their silence is in stark contrast to Deadpool's endless prattle. No smart alec retorts will ever come from them because only Deadpool and his white male friends are allowed to be vocal and ""witty"". In Deadpool's world white male privilege reigns supreme. Neither women nor people of color are permitted to have a personality, strong opinions, or an attitude.I am a huge science fiction and fantasy genre fan. If Fox and Marvel are going to keep churning out sexist, racially insensitive crap like this, I'll be voting with my dollar and watch something less insulting at the movies.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
What an amazingly brilliant load of fluff,"11 February 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed this part.

Moreover, it's rated R for all the good reasons !Ryan Reynolds was epic in his role of Wade Wilson AKA Deadpool. Morena Baccarin plays his ravish girlfriend, Vanessa. TJ Miller is there for some comic relief. But..it's all about Deadpool. It's all him. Not the villains, not the guest stars, it's all him and his crude, vulgar yet, hilarious humor. The timings are impeccable.Villains and Guest stars, Gina Carano AKA Angel was pretty cool and sexy. Stefan Kapicic AKA Colossus was there for some impressive CGI showdown, and comic relief. Brianna Hildebrand AKA Negasonic Teenage Warhead, solely picked because of the name, was impressive. Specially her powers. The best guest star was not there in body, you'll find out.Overall, if you want great laughter, enjoy epic fights and a simple story, Deadpool is the movie. Marvel keeps on impressing us.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Marvel must never go away from an R rating ever again!,"Deadpool really made me see Marvel's movies in a very different way, and made me expect much more from their already wonderful movies. I was very worried when I heard of a deadpool movie (being a deadpool reader myself), but I must say they've done an honor to Deadpool's first feature film. The fighting/violence was very well done and more graphic than there has been in a marvel movie, if Marvel takes anything from this movie they should finally see and that regardless of the rating their fans will flock and awe over their movies. And will be excited for every evolution that takes their movies one step closer to the comics, regardless of the seriousness of the attitude.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The rogue marvel,"Merc with a Mouth clowns in his own movie after his cameo appearance in X-Men: Origins as mercenary Wade Wilson which also rather contradicts this film.Ryan Reynolds finally has a monster hit in Deadpool, wisecracking his way through and breaking the fourth wall multiple times. The film also serves as a origins tale which disguises the fact that this revenge saga has a thin story. Deadpool wants Ajax (Ed Skrein), the British villain responsible for leaving him with a deformed face after experimenting on him to unleash his hidden X genes and who has now kidnapped his girlfriend. Deadpool pursues him with the help of a few X-Men that Fox's budget allows.The film was made by first time director Tim Miller who sets his stall and tone of the movie with the flippant opening titles. As Marvel films go, this one is rude, the violence more visceral, the comedy a bit hit and miss as Reynolds makes fun of the X-Men and Marvel in general including the Disney Marvel films. Deadpool even finds time to make fun of a handsome actor called Ryan Reynolds.I found the film amusing but the plot was weak and the budget was low which the director was disguising with his own slicing and dicing. Reynolds though found the right tone.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The Only Marvel Film That Didn't Bore Me,"It seems there truly is a first time for everything. It's borderline painful for me to admit this, but I enjoyed a Marvel movie. I wouldn't have gone to see Deadpool on my own, but I was hanging with a friend for the weekend and he insisted on buying me a ticket. What happened next was extraordinary: I went an hour and a half without looking at my watch or wondering what was piling up in my inbox.Perhaps that was part of the movie's success: that it didn't push the 2 hour mark and that it wasn't straining, like some perpetually frustrated fanboy, to announce the credibility of comic book story lines to the world. ""COMIC BOOKS ARE COOL NOW TOO! SEE?!? THEY'RE MAKING MOVIES WITH BUDGETS OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHICH MAKES THEM OFFICIALLY ACCEPTED IN THE CULTURAL ZEITGEIST!"" No, rather Deadpool was made for less than 60 million, the script was clever and tight, and it focused on one of the strengths of the comic book format: their absurdity and over-the-top nature.Ultimately, it's another revenge story, but you can get away with following one of the tried and true plot templates as long as you put an original spin on it. Deadpool does this in spades with its buckets of irreverence, a few moments of sincerity to provide contrast, comedy that actually hits and some well filmed action. Also, by shedding the PG-13 shackles, Deadpool remained true to its roots and is another recent example of how film making for adults can still be commercially successful in the 21st century.My biggest gripe with the movie is its ""look"", especially the background shots whenever you're outside. Like most modern Hollywood blockbusters the environments have this weird, washed-out gray coloring to them that's about as far from authentic as one can possibly get. That's no doubt a cost cutting measure, relying on CG to fill in for well designed sets and difficult outdoor shots, but the ugliness and laziness of these cheap backgrounds is pervasive in the frame, spoiling what could otherwise be a spectacular looking picture.It's not an amazing film, but I liked Deadpool. It was well paced, skillfully written, it made me laugh and by being the antithesis of the last 15 years of lackluster super hero movies, it became the first good comic based film since Sin City.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Five Word Review: Massively Enjoyable, Hilarious, Subversive, Disjointed","Even since before the character was mercilessly ruined in 2009's forgettable 'X- Men Origins: Wolverine', Ryan Reynolds (Buried, The Voices) has been passionate about bringing cult comic-book character Deadpool to the big screen, with all his profanity, violence, political incorrectness, fourth-wall breaking, and generally un-superhero-like behaviour. So here we finally are, with unknown director Tim Miller and the writers of Zombieland leading Reynolds along with Morena Baccarin (Firefly), Ed Skrein (Game of Thrones), TJ Miller (Cloverfield) and Gina Carano (Haywire) on his honourable quest to inject some variation into the superhero film market.Deadpool is a film that knows exactly what it is, which is evidence by the funny, tone-setting opening credits. It's far funnier than most comedies, more exciting than many superhero films, and just more plain enjoyable than most of today's cinema. Reynolds could not be more perfectly cast (other than, perhaps, H. Jon Benjamin, of Archer) in this role. Under the iconic mask his snarky, insulting tone mocks and swears, whilst his action-film-star look is highly appropriate. He even manages to lend some drama to the role. The writers - as acknowledged by the opening credits, the true heroes - have written a tight, quotable script that is bursting with one-lines that will be seen across a thousand internet comment chains for years to come. Alongside exciting action with some good violence - refreshing in increasingly kid-friendly superhero films - and glorious profanity, Deadpool is a welcome change and hopefully a gateway to more adult action films on the general market.It's obviously not perfect: it often feels disjointed due to its (admittedly admirable) desire to showcase all its talents at once, and not all of the jokes fully land. Nevertheless, Deadpool is one of the best superhero films I've seen in a while; remarkably enjoyable and a very good watch indeed. 80/100.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Ridiculously funny, only dinosaurs will hate it!","All the dinosaurs are afraid of the t-Rex and all future comic book hero movies probably dread Deadpool. Reynolds sets a new standard for movies in the genre doing things comic book movies never dared before.The erotic scenes are lovely. There's quite a bit of nudity, but the entire sequence is hilarious so it's far from being porn level.The jokes are great. It's low-class humor, so if you're a snob you'd better go watch the Notebook or Titanic for the billionth time, this isn't the movie for you.The back story is cliché, that's why they get it out of the way quickly and with plenty of humor while the main bad guy makes me poop bricks in a very unconventional manner.As for the other characters. They're tools and have little depth themselves, which is just fine because especially the big guy also acts like a tool.All in all it was a great movie experience and the group I went with all loved it. If you don't then unlike Reynolds you probably do like having a stick up your you-know-what.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
bullshit ever seen,"i expected an epic out of this but i rather got boring and juvenile story.This movie is full of unparliamentary dialougues and nothing inspiring about.Is this what we give to our friends and family to watch ? btw ryan renolds did excellent job in the movie.i didn't get why wolverine was in the movieis he there to get kicked by deadpoolThe film's biggest weakness, if it has one, is in its supporting characters — there's just not a lot for them to do. Deadpool's fellow superpowered beings — Colossus (Stefan Kapicic), Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand), and Angel Dust (Gina Carano) — mostly just stay out of his way, though Colossus and Negasonic each have their moments. T.J. Miller is effective as Deadpool/Wade Wilson's BFF Weasel, but he feels like he was just ported over from HBO's Silicon Valley, where he plays a startup bro. Ajax, the movie's main villain, is sinister (and good-looking), but his mutant ability — not being able to feel pain — doesn't make him feel like much of a threat.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Deadpool is for anyone who loves a hilarious R-rated action superhero film!,"Previously, Ryan Reynolds had portrayed Green Lantern, which I remember enjoying but I later found out others had not. Knowing that, I have to say that me and my movie theatre-working friend really enjoyed him here as Deadpool, a wisecracking costumed hero from Marvel Comics who swears, kills, and is mainly after the guy who did something bad to him. He also has a fine-looking girl played by Morena Baccarin who seems a perfect match for him. This was quite a funny, action-packed movie we both enjoyed. The beginning credits were really funny and if you're familiar with a certain John Hughes movie, you really shouldn't miss the after credits scene...so that's a high recommendation of Deadpool.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

You get what was Advertised and it's PERFECT!,"So Deadpool.As the name might suggest won't be your typical marvel movie, and going by trailers and any kind of background reading of the comics won't be the ideal movie for Nanas who hate swearing, sex and violence. This movie is the perfect first movie for Deadpool which stays true to the comics. Simple plot line as it is simply an origins story. Origin stories are meant to be simple and predictable because everyone knows how it ends as the person becomes the embodiment of the comic book character.Ryan Reynolds nails it. Mostly because he is so similar to the comic book character that it's scary. His line deliveries are just right for Deadpool and the reason is because most of the main jokes were improvised (something Ryan and TJ are very good at).It's violent, it's crass, sexual and wrong. Exactly as it is in the comics, and pretty much what the trailers suggested (beyond the funny love story trailer, which probably caught the 1 star reviewers hook line and sinker!)If you like deadpool comics, watch it. If you like the crass Ryan Reynolds of past (van wilder/blade 2), watch it.Otherwise don't bother going just so you can affirm you wouldn't like it in the first place.(Insert sarcastic rant here) I give titanic 1/10 because it was too lovey dovey and there wasn't enough superpowers, gore and crass humour. ""But Adam, none of that was showed in the trailer, in fact, the opposite was shown in the trailer. Why would you expect anything other than what was advertised with the trailer and rating?""

They got it right with this one.,"Deadpool (2016) Directed by Tim Miller CinemaRyan Reynold has tried to get this Deadpool film off the ground for 10 years as he is a big fan of the character and desperately wants to make amends for how the character was butchered in the now defunct timeline of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. It took the leaking of some old commissioned test footage that got comic fandom buzzing to finally get greenlit. Then Reynolds and co wisely settled for a very low budget so they could keep the film R rated and have delivered a film very authentic to its origins.For those unaware of Deadpool, he is a former Special Forces operative turned smart mouthed mercenary who is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopting the alter ego Deadpool. He is part of the Marvel universe or more specifically within big screen parameters, the X-Men universe. He is famous for being the one character who constantly breaks the fourth wall and speaks to the readers directly, or in this case viewers. Everything about his character is not the usual fare for superhero films which is half the reason he has never made it properly for this long.Reynolds was born for the role and he delivers with the help of a smart script that does not hold back and my shock many who are used to the PG super hero films of the last decade. The supporting cast are great too and include some familiar characters. There is no shaky-cam for the action which is great and it really delivers. The budget may have been quite low comparatively but it rarely shows except for in the special effect in a small part of the finale. This may end up being the funniest comedy of the year, the best action film of the year, the raunchiest R rated film of the year and it wouldn't surprise me if in a year when there are more high profile super-hero films coming out than ever before, that this ends up being at the top of that mountain too.This is a smaller film that does not need for their to be earth destroying consequences to give it gravitas. Much like Ant-man from last year the situation is smaller but the film has relationships set up and some heart as well but not unlike the Daredevil netflix show, the gloves are off here and they are way off and anything goes!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Good Watch But Not a perfect 10,"I am very disappointed to see blatant vote manipulation on here for this movie. Don't expect this movie to be an 8, it's entertainng and a fun watch but does not merit a score of 8. IMDb really should start breakdown score instead of general score.This movie is an origin story of deadpool character in marvel universe, how he became superhero and join forces with other superhero characters. Deadpool is a superhero character but without the seriousness of a superhero.This is really more of a comedy genre with good amount of amazing action scenes. There's plenty of in-joke humor for the fans, not as funny for non-fans. I feel this movie tries too hard to be edgy and relies too much on profanity to be funny that it feels cringey at some parts. Maybe that's intentional.Storytelling-wise, I think it's quite effective. Due to it's less serious nature, the movie plays out quite well. It doesn't feel slow and draggy.

not just flogging a Deadpool!,"Like many other people who read Deadpool's (mis)adventures on a monthly basis, this film had a lot to live up to to make me happy. Getting the right blend of over the top violence and gore, crude jokes and 4th wall breaking references was never going to be easy, but it has been achieved with great success! The film is consistently funny from start to finish as long as you have the right level of maturity or aren't prudish.Ryan Renyolds is perfect as the regeneratin' degenerate, delivering gags as fast the the bullets are coming from the various guns, and DP's wingman Weasel is not short of wit either. One of the best things here was Colossus and Negasonic teenage warhead appearance, which gives not only more options for characters for Deadpool to mock, but also gives the movie the feeling of being a part of a bigger universe in the same way as the Marvel studios movies do.If there is one thing that I must criticise about this film, its that sometimes, the switch between the action to the origin flashbacks don't feel fluid, leaving the audience wanting more of the action, but instead just jumping back in time in what feels like the worst time. This could be to highlight how disjointed Wade's mind is though so I'll let it slide.Bring on the sequel! 9/10 for pure entertainment, I mean, why else would you watch a film if not to be entertained?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Deadpool - Movie Review,"Deadpool: ""From the studio that inexplicably sewed his f**king mouth shut the first time, comes... me!"".One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humor) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.Never have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it's an A+ like Chris Stuckmann rated it or a masterpiece of all comic book movies, but did I have fun watching this movie? ABSOLUTELY. It's a film that fans wanted and got.I can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and that's make the character of Deadpool he's own. He was terrific has the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.The writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.I'm so happy that this movie is rated R and not some water down PG- 13 movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated PG-13, then you really don't know the character at all. I'm taking to you Grace Randolph. Just because some little eight year old boy (who probably doesn't know who Deadpool really is), whats to see the movie, but can't because he's not old enough to see it, doesn't mean it should be changed to a PG-13 for someone who doesn't even know the character of Deadpool. These fans have waited 7 or 8 years for this character to be done right, so this little boys mother should teach him some patience.Now for the flaws: How much better would this movie be if it had visual comedy. I mean Edge Wright should seriously do a Marvel movie, because I know for a fact that he will make the best Marvel movie ever when it comes to it's comedy, pasting and execution (something that Age of Ultron couldn't do). I highly recommend seeing Every Frame and Printing video on ""How to do Visual comedy"", because Tony Zhou knows some much about movies better then I do. But that's what I felt was missing in this movie and I know this is Tim Millers first big film (And an impressive one as well), but I'm just saying that it would be really brilliant if there was visual comedy in a movie with Deadpool.While I did think the writing was great, but some of the jokes in the movie I didn't find that funny. And no, it's not because I didn't get it or I didn't understand the reference, because all of the jokes and reference in this movie I understood clearly, it's just that I didn't find some of it funny.Overall Deadpool is a fresh, entertaining comic book movie that it's hard for any comic book lover not to like this movie. You bet I'll be seeing the squeal when it comes out since I know it's in good hands.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Where exactly does Deadpool stand in the History of Cinema?,"If you could image your subconscious thoughts during a movie, you'd come up with a leather-bound thesis after watching The Godfather and Pulp Fiction, an exuberant treatise after La Dolce Vita, a double-retrograde flowchart after Memento and a dialectic paperback after The Dark Knight. After Deadpool..you can relay such thoughts using a binary alphabet;""Ha. Haa. Ha ha. Ah! AHH!! Hah. AAAH."" It humors in its own laughability. That's something, if you'll go for anything.Ryan Reynolds is inviolably cast as Deadpool (not-so-much as Wade), and Ed Skrein as ""A British Villain"", whose invulnerable machismo would have sipped the tension out of Game of Thrones, is appropriate here, sneezing at impalements-by-sword like they were fly-bites. Morena Baccarin looks good naked and is a good actress. The movie kindly lets her reveal one of those things as Vanessa.Up on the technical floor, does Deadpool have a unique cinematic vocabulary, in the way of Battleship Potemkin or even Un Chien Andalou...? The opening tableau vivant was more imaginatively rendered in Days of Future Past...and the concept was more provocatively employed in Cashback (2006), objectively; it's a tired, haggard dog of a trick. In its defense, there IS that ass-to-ass match cut, and...that's it. Other than that it speaks in the same bromidic visual clichés our optic ears are numb from hearing, it might as well be (and is) a competently made romantic comedy about a guy whose uprooted penis can grow back, each time with a ""boing!!""Yet it's billed as an ""action"" movie. Violence is a delicious promise from the trailers. Do its cartoonishly (the script admits as much) over-choreographed dance/fight scenes contain anything 1/10th as visceral as Morsov's Leap from Fury Road, or even Buster Keaton's locomotive hypercrobatics from The General (1926)? It fartin-wishes. More like those burn-worthy Kung Fu D-movies circa 1995, whose poster is the hero walking away from a 'blown-up' matchstick explosion.Down on the fundamental story level, there's only a string of 30 seconds during its 108-minute unspooling time during which Deadpool acquires the illusion of depth; stalking his girlfriend Vanessa and shamed by his burnt-sausage looks, strangers on the street throw censoriously disgusted stares at Wade Wilson; ""get a mask!"". This scene earned an echo of thought about the human condition; ""Yeah, they all do that."" A non-teenage film would use this development as a launchpad into balancing laughs and meditation on societal vanity versus individual dysmorphic syndrome. But hey, the movie tells me....meditation is for the temple, NOT the multiplex. Touche and ha ha. Safer to take the crowd's advice..and please them.So much for being a ""popcorn movie""--and only a passable one at that--Age of Ultron features one timelessly ponderable moment: ""What is This?"", wonders Ultron in basso elettrico upon awakening and achieving self-awareness. It's a bit of writing that invoked the same feeling of primal, dread-filled fascination in me as The Genesis of the Robot and the subsequent Birth of False Maria in Metropolis (1927). It also made me wonder, on an embryonic cogitative level...if that same thought had occupied my inchoate fetal mind at a point during my gestation. All this during an ultimately disappointing Superboys' Day-out Comedy.You see a different kind of self-awareness in Deadpool...Wade knows he's a comic book character in a Fox movie with an audience watching it. Only problem is this--apart from pandering to fan-men and fan-women (but ..fanboys, mostly)--does not serve the story at all. The existential disequilibrium between Deadpool and Ultron is; Ultron will always have achieved self-awareness, duplicated it and attempted to destroy all those who preceded him to it, while Deadpool ends up talking to himself if you go for a snack and leave the BluRay playing. Even he can't laugh at how kooky-ridiculous he looks doing that.Detractors of Deadpool cite how it only shuffles the deck without adding any fresh cards; breaking the fourth wall has been popular since The Tramp winked at us in Charlie Chaplin's films...die-hard fans bark at that, ""it's the first time it's been done in a comic book adaptation!"" Alrighty then. I suppose the next time a kid splits his knee open, and some Superloon licks the wound..it'll be heralded as novelty too.As one blasphemer--who hasn't been in the game much between 1994 and now--put it, Deadpool is the freshest script he's encountered since Pulp Fiction...except Tarantino's Film is a deconstruction, a subversion and a re-invention of the Hollywood Gangster Genre. Deadpool on the other pole isn't one cent more than a sardonic riff. The kind of insights Deadpool brings to the superhero-cash-cow genre are the sort you throw-away with pothead bar-acquaintances on a lazy Saturday afternoon (ouchie! superhero landings are hard on your knees!), or lying awake on the operating table..(the camera's the only thing that's pulling out tonight!)..waiting for the second half of your lobotomy. Apparently, say the fans, that's more than good enough for a Comic Book Movie. Ah.Am I a pedant-on-stilts who can't have fun at the (real silly) movies? Ha ha ha ha. ""Nah"", I'm just an adult who was thinking when I watched the movie. That's why, it earns a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

The Deadpool Rises...,"""Deadpool"" (2016) is the first superhero film to arrive this year, and sure has a lot of competition from giant blockbuster superhero films such as ""Batman vs Superman"" (2016) and ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016). Do to it's risqué R-rating full of violence, foul language, and awkward sex scenes/comments, it seemed that ""Deadpool"" had a lot to possibly loose or gain, especially for 20th Century Fox and their X-men character rights.Even though ""Deadpool"" is not the first R-rated superhero film ever made (""The Punisher,"" 2004 and ""Watchmen,"" 2009 to name a few), it is the first to push full on Marvel style fun with a raunchy R-rating. The film succeeds in being fun entertainment, while also staying true to the character of Deadpool.Ryan Reynolds completely redeems himself as Wade Wilson/Deadpool (after the underwhelming and dull ""X-men: Origins Wolverine"" 2009), and proves that this is the role he was meant to play. His snarky immature humor, hyper active personality, and especially his voice help make Deadpool one of the most lovable (or maybe unlovable to some) characters in superhero cinema today.The other supporting characters don't have as much to go on as Deadpool, aside from Colossus (whom shines more here than in any past X-men film). The rest of the cast seems to just be there for the story elements (a villain, henchman (or woman), girlfriend, and best friend). This is a Deadpool film, however, so Deadpool wouldn't want any other characters stealing his show.""Deadpool"" is well filmed, and the way he breaks the fourth wall feels natural and not out of place. Director Tim Miller may not have a lot on his film resume, but he proves that he knows this character through and through with his technique.This film is great entertainment and proves that you don't have to be associated with a PG-13 rating, or Disney/Marvel Studios to make a successful superhero movie. It will be interesting to see how Deadpool affects the future of its X-men franchise, and other superhero franchises in the years to come (especially now that the ""Deadpool 2"" is being made). I'm hoping that studios take this as a lesson in making a true character to the comics, not just making an R-rated film for the sake of an R-rating.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
'Looks ARE everything! Ever heard Dave Beckham speak?

It is apparently based on the Marvel Comics character by the same name (Deadpool is a fictional antihero Initially Deadpool was depicted as a supervillain but later evolved into his more recognizable antiheroic persona. Deadpool is a disfigured and mentally unstable mercenary with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor and physical prowess.

Even for those saturated with the endless expensive overblown repetitious Marvel Comic films that flood the market (making billions of dollars), This film is funny, not only due to the comedic writing of Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, Fabian Nicienza and Rob Liefeld, but also due to start Ryan Reynolds inimitable talent for admixing silly banter with heroic handsome good looks and fancy footwork.Very briefly (because there isn't much story), 'This is the origin story of former Special Forces operative turned mercenary Wade Wilson, who after being subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopts the alter ego Deadpool.

Success!!!Audiences and Critics Love the Film to Varying Degrees but No One can Deny that this is a ""Balls to the Wall"" attempt at Supercharging the Super-Hero Movie.It's Completely Nutzoid, Irreverent, Reverent, Sharply Written and Directed, makes Onslaughts of its Own Wallowing in Excessive Everything, and is the Most Fun that Fanboys have had at the Movies, maybe, Ever.Comic-Books have always had an Ability to Hold-the-Hand of the Reader as He/She Holds it in Their Hands and makes You Part of the Club, an Insider as You Enter that Nether World of Outrageousness. You're In with the In Crowd, You're In on the Jokes, You're Part of the Action.That's ""Deadpool"" in a Nutshell...Oops left it Wide Open for Wade with that one.Note...Thank the Comic-Book Gods for the ""R"" Rating. There's no wimp-out with this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Outrageously funny, original and entertaining","Wade Wilson (played by Ryan Reynolds) is a small-time mercenary. He meets Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) and falls in love. Life is idyllic until one day he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Things look bleak but a man appears who says he can be cured, through a treatment that gives him superhero powers. After initially turning him down, Wilson agrees, and meets the man behind the project, Ajax (Ed Skrein). While undergoing the treatment he discovers that it will involve him becoming a mutant, and he will need to undergo several painful tests to discover what his mutant abilities are. Plus, Ajax is a sadist. The treatment results in Wilson getting powers of accelerated healing but also leaves him terribly disfigured. Ajax tries to keep him a prisoner but he escapes. He now has two aims: find Vanessa and make Ajax pay for what he did to him. Killing Ajax may not be as easy it seems, as Ajax is also a mutant and the meddling, do-gooder superhero Collossus and his sidekick Negasonic Teenage Warhead keep getting in the way. Oh, and Wade Wilson is now operating under an alias: Deadpool.After all the all style-no-substance, CGI-driven comic book movies, this movie is a breath of fresh air in the genre. Outrageously funny, original and entertaining. Clever, snappy, laugh-a-minute dialogue. Some great cultural references and in-jokes, especially regarding other comic book movies.Basic but decent plot. Hardly Citizen Kane stuff but at least it has a plot, which is more than one can say for most comic book movies. Decent character depth and engagement.Good action sequences too.This all said, it really is all about the humour and Ryan Reynolds delivers it with aplomb. Good support from TJ Miller in the humour department and Morena Baccarin in the drama, romance and looks departments.Easily the best comic book movie made in a very long time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
We need this  sardonic actioner at this time of year!,"""You're probably thinking 'This is a superhero movie, but that guy in the suit just turned that other guy into a f----ng kebab.' Surprise, this is a different kind of superhero story."" DeadpoolRyan Reynolds' titular Deadpool is not like any other superhero; in fact he's an antihero. He murders men and women and murders language as well. Yet, his unceasing banter is sometimes witty and full of cultural allusions, especially to X Men, who would like him to join them.But he's not ready yet, for he needs to track down the baddie, Ajax (Ed Skrein), who gave him a horrible face as a result of an experiment that cured his cancer and gave him supernatural powers. In the course of the pursuit, Wade (Deadpool's civilian name) meets Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), a dark-haired beauty who makes his life worth living.Most of the film is of course the usual CGI comic-book roughhousing but peppered with so much irony and sarcasm that it's worthwhile just trying to catch half the tossed-off lines. Reynolds is a master of the one liners, many of which can be found in the IMDb sidebar ""quotes."" For example:""WAIT! You may be wondering why the red suit. Well, that's so bad guys don't see me bleed."" Or ""I didn't ask to be super, and I'm no hero. But when you find out your worst enemy is after your best girl, the time has come to be a f----ng superhero."" DeadpoolAnyway, it's the kind of dialogue best suited to adolescent boys, but this arrested adult critic finds the dialogue entertaining and the movie a refreshingly sardonic take on an inviolate genre. Enjoy this out of the summer-hero fest at a time of year when we all can welcome the relief from otherwise mediocre and boring fare.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Absolutely BRILLIANT!!!,"If you have a taste for Crude humor/Violent action/Abso-freakin'-lutely crazy love stories(?) then Deadpool is your thing.Downright, one of the best comic book adoptions I have ever seen made by Hollywood. Ryan Reynolds was born to play Wade Wilson. T.J Miller plays a brilliant supporting role.The direction, screenplay and CGI are all great but the one thing that I want to give a special mention to is the ""Script writing"". It is Fantastic!! It is difficult to gauge humor in words, you have to experience it for yourself to understand what I mean.Overall a 9/10 for me. If you are reading this review, I am guessing you are already interested in the movie but just making sure before taking the plunge. GO for it !!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Potty mouth archangel out for justice,"Highly invented parody of the super hero genre, with Ryan Reynalds at his cocksure best. It seems the super hero movie has been in vogue for the past few years now, with studios clambering to release any kind of movie, TV show or animation attached to a super hero premise. There was a time when studios waited to unleash their tent pole super hero movies onto the world. This usually followed a long laborious period of rumours of actors playing the part, directors walking in and out of production, script writers and script doctors being hired and fired. Now it seems that every six months a new super hero movie or new look super hero is being reborn, rebuilt, re-configured, renewed, re-hashed, re-imagined or just plain revealed. Add to this the fact that within these movies are a scatter gun of loosely attached characters who will go on to have their own movie releases. This really does say all you need to know about the state of the Hollywood movie making process at this moment in time, and perhaps says more about international audiences appetite for spandex clad crapola.Now add to this the new Deadpool movie. A movie which is so self aware of its roots as a super hero movie it borders on the pastiche. The joke in Deadpool is that the character is aware he is in a movie, that alone is enough to separate it from the usual slam bang visuals of the ordinary super hero movie. Now factor in that he is a foul mouthed, sex-obsessed, drug abusing, wise-cracking, mutant hero, and you begin to start wondering how this movie ever made it to the cinemas. In this age of polished, stars and stripes, hero obsessed genre of movie making, it is refreshing that Hollywood deemed it worthy to add to the cannon the antithesis of the super hero, and that antithesis is Deadpool.Whilst not totally re-inventing the wheel, Deadpool succeeds through it's sheer disregard for the genre. Deadpool wears it's 'R' rated badge proudly, neither trying to kowtow to the box office 'PG' crowd nor go full blood and guts towards insatiable violence. It straddles a fine line between the two, providing some clever 'meta' references to it's modern audience, whilst at the same time being visually eye popping with some deft cartoon style OTT violence. Even though at heart this is a super hero movie, with a character that has been present in comic book form for decades, and is straddled with a plot reminiscent of any Marvel/DC movie/origin tale that you care to mention. Deadpool comes across as fresh and a nice tonic to what we have seen of the tired comic book genre so far.When you start to analyse why it works you begin to realise that it falls nicely onto the feet of one Ryan Reynalds. Ever since Ryan limped onto our screens as Van Wilder in the early noughties, he has been an actor who has been left in a state of limbo artistically. Whilst good looking and toned and more than capable of holding a romantic lead, he could never quite shake his obvious comedic chops, always delivering a line as if he was laughing to himself on the inside. Thus we saw his peers such as Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio even Ben Affleck (all in the same age bracket) go on to make more serious movies with great success, all successfully transitionally from drama to action with little fuss. Whereas Reynalds appeared to be left behind still trying to define his acting, unsure if he was a romantic lead, action hero or a comedian.In Deadpool I feel Ryan has rediscovered his range. In essence he is not an actor to be taken seriously, nor a superhero who we can convincingly believe is capable of saving the world. For me he is a modern day Chevy Chase, all knowing smiles and smarmy charm. He is a throwback to the 80's comedic sensibility where it was OK to laugh at people who were different or less good looking than you. He is the actor we all love to hate, overly confident, limited in range, lacking in subtleties, and way too quick with a one liner. But when he is good, he is great, and when he is bad, he is just damn unwatchable. In Deadpool he is note perfect.That isn't to say that Deadpool is a perfect movie. As part of the X-Men entourage it does spread it's bets by including links to the X-Men saga, clearly with a view to cashing in on a Deadpool/X- Men collaboration at some time in the future. However, this link seems somehow fitting. Deadpool as a comic book character exists alongside the X-Men, furthermore the inclusion of Colossus is in itself a joke, and one that is cleverly interspersed into the script, rather than ham fistedly wedged in to tie the two entities together.A fun, inventive spin on the super hero genre, and a much welcomed breath of fresh air to the current status quo of Hollywood blockbusters. It will be interesting to see how Deadpool develops in his inevitable sequel and if the powers that be have the balls to put their money where their mouth is and give him free reign in an X-Men spin off. Judging by how well this movie came together, all signs look good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The best superhero movie after The Dark Knight,"2016 is a year full of blockbusters and comic book movies. Marvel and DC are the most popular here and they are both preparing spectacles for this year. This is the first one out of six. But I wasn't as excited about this movie as much as I was about Suicide Squad, Batman v Superman, Civil War and even X-Men:Apocalypse. I expected this movie to be pretty good but I wasn't super excited. And when I came out of the theater, I was blown away! This is the best superhero movie after The Dark Knight and the best Marvel movie.After awful Fantastic Four reboot, Fox kinda got a bad rap, but they totally knew what they were doing with this one. Screenplay is just awesome and I hope it gets nominated at the next year Academy Awards. It's full of clever 4th wall breaks and hilarious lines. Ryan Reynolds fits the role perfectly and fans have nothing to be afraid of. We already saw him in X-Men Origins:Wolverine, but he was criminally underused there and butchered to the point that at the end of the movie he was no longer Deadpool. Thankfully, it doesn't happen here, and why would it? It would be absurd if they did that in his own movie. The villain is a great challenge to Deadpool and is played perfectly. An R rating also helped the movie a lot and if it was toned down, it just wouldn't be as great as it is this way and it would butcher the character once again, so it was a very wise decision to have an R rating.This was one of my least anticipated superhero movies this year, but it will probably end up being the best and I doubt any of the others will top this. It's so much fun and you won't be bored for a second and it's very well written. And also, if you're a parent, don't bring your kid if it's younger than 13 or anyone who can't bear violence.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Deserves a sequel,"It's is a fun ride. This is not a typical superhero movie. It can't be 100% possible in real life but who cares. The movie is for the grown- ups, and they made sure all the fun was in there. Ryan Reynolds got a breakthrough role here. He is definitely the cool guy not for the bad guys want to be around. The actress is great too. Beautiful as she is, she can be a naughty, and it was a great joy to watch. She and Reynold had such good chemistry together. The movie is fast pace and the action scenes are great. This superhero definitely deserves a sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
This movie just tries to make you laugh,"This Movie marketing is much better than the movie itself! I expected, it would be great, well-directed, and well-written, but the fact is: it's just 'Kick-Ass' with 'Marvel' package. Violence, comedy, romance, violence, comedy, romance, violence, comedy, romance. Pointless. Meaningless. Bad script. Bad directed. So many movies have better romance story, 'The Raid' has better action scenes, and the jokes in this movie are crude, dumb, and dirty. With a bunch of pop references that will get outdated fast. Not even understood by people outside America. This movie tries so hard to entertain, but it's boring! It's absolutely cheap, this movie just tries to make you laugh, that's all, there's no good stroy! Mark Wahlberg should be in it.

"Well, I like it.","Ryan Reynolds is a good comedian and Morena Baccarin is always one of the most beautiful women ever (unfortunately for me: both Gemini and married). The movie is simply goofy, fun, dynamic, crazy at moments, off-beat and entertaining. Full of good one-liners. Jokes really aren't as bad as some of the reviewers suggest here. If we take the whole context into the account, the highlight of this movie is not exceptional sfx, but humor. Essentially, this is a mockery, but who says superheroes cannot be fun? As many observed here, not for children (and language is a minor issue here). Still exceptionally entertaining and I watched it with many smirks on my face. Let's say: intelligently fatuous. Just the way I like it. Worth watching several times to catch all the details (yup. it's fast paced). Go for it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Amazing!,"First of all, I am not a fan of comic book hero movies and i hate action films.This one is both but I absolutely loved it! Why? It's funny!

I judge a movie by the feeling I have after watching, and this one put a big smile on my face, made me feel good! And I never really liked Ryan Reynolds! Now, go figure! p.s.One of the fellow users put the fans of this movie into some categories.I find that very offensive, besides, I'm a middle-aged mother of three, and my favorite genre is horror and psychological thriller, so I don't think I fit anywhere.

"Deadpool was one dirty, sexy, bloody and overall fun ride to go on!","Deadpool I must say is the best movie I have seen since Star Wars: The Force Awakens. When I went in to see this with my dad, we both knew it was gonna be amazing, but we didn't know it was going to be THIS amazing! I loved every second of it and me, including everyone on the theater, completely laughed their asses off every time a sarcastic remark or pun or joke was made because this movie was that funny! Now for the action, it was perfect and gory, just the way I like it. There is a lot of flips, kicks, punches being thrown, cute little drawings being colored and heads and hands coming off. The romance is spectacular along with how much it ties into the drama, not giving any spoilers, but it all works and you know the pain he's going through when it happens. This movie perfectly has comedy, action, drama, romance, and horror(kinda) all represented in one movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone I know and I know I'm going to see this at least 10 times more. Deadpool is definitely something you cannot miss. Definitely check it out even if you don't have time, make time, because there is always time for Deadpool. If I could, I would give this movie 12/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
the best movie I've seen in ages! hilarious! this is all Ryan Renolds.,"An ex special forces mercenary who finds love is diagnosed with cancer and out of desperation to live with his new found love, accepts an offer in a dodgy experiment to become a mutant with super healing powers to cure his illness but the price is literally hideous and atrociously torturous so Deadpool is born and he sets out on a rampage for revenge on the people who so deceitfully made him the thing he has become.Anyone who doesn't like this movie has a very dismal sense of humour. It's so hilarious and Ryan Renolds gets let lose in his hilarity in this. This part is made for him like iron man for Robert Downey Jr. It is much more violent and explicit than the usual Xmen franchise but it's part of the entertainment for Deadpool is no hero nor a bad guy either. I found myself crying with laughter. This is such an off beat unpredictable movie. I loved it. Not for kids folks. That's for sure. Another fantastic Marvel flick!!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Not that funny,"You know, I wanted to like Deadpool because the action scenes were cool, but I wasn't laughing because his jokes weren't funny and he kept interrupting his own movie!

Deadpool is full mayhem.,"What a way to start the comic book movies of 2016 huh!?First of all, Ryan Reynolds shines in the role, truly SHINES. He IS Deadpool, and I can't think of any actor that can match what he did in the film. Second, this is rated R, and going in I was expecting, of course, a lot of violence, nudity, etc., and that aspect of the movie didn't disappoint me at all. It thoroughly goes all in with that, and I really enjoyed it. The humor was so executed effectively and was really sharp for most of the time. The action was good for the most part, especially in the beginning and right at the end. This is a fast paced movie, so for most of the movie I wasn't really bored. Score/soundtrack was awesome.With the things I didn't like with movie, it was mostly the antagonist and the second act. I didn't really care for the villain, for his character was empty and lacked background, for me. The things we learned from Wade Wilson and his back story, while was fine in the movie, it does take away some of the energy from the film itself. It started so strong that the madness does backtrack a little bit. That being said, there were some strong fun to be had during those points of the movie.Overall, this is a pure and genuine comic book movie that doesn't hold back from all the craziness and enjoyment. Don't take the movie way too seriously, and you're going to have a GREAT time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"It's entertaining, even breathlessly so at times, but it panders to the same ideals and structure it lampoons.","Sure, the 'merc with a mouth' may make his way onto our screens in all his uncensored, fourth-wall shattering and gut-spilling glory but once the initial 'shock' of 'Deadpool (2016)' has worn off, the antics of this anti-hero start to wear a bit thin. The constant turns-to-camera, pop-culture pilfering jokes and general crudity do become slightly tiresome since they constantly take the place of a varied and interesting plot. Don't get me wrong, it's entertaining, even breathlessly so at times. It's fairly funny fairly consistently and rather exciting on occasion, especially during its standout 'highway' action set-piece - which is sadly ruthlessly segmented. The sense that it panders to the same ideals and structure it lampoons is a strong one, though, and in the end it just can't escape the shadow of the genre it is trying so hard to defy. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Awesome.,"A true spirit of dead pool. Simply awesome! This superhero flick is a perfect example of how to make an introduction into fictional universe filled with super heroes. It's funny, charming and perfect. Raynolds had truly redeemed himself from the green lantern fiasco. He's an upgraded version of his Wilder days, and that's what we like. He captured the spirit of the hero to the perfection. I took two points off, due to lack of proper antagonist representation (IMHO), same Indian taxi driver\Wilder sidekick joke, stereotypical teen and righteous Collosus, and few more glitches. But overall, this movie is a true fun. Also I'm having a bit trouble to see how dead pool will fit into marvel universe, as the style is different. Never the less, this one is a gem.

Solid movie.,"If there was a 3 word-limit to write a review I would say: I love it. This movie was ALMOST flawless. Starting with acting and ending with highly sophisticated jokes about penises and anuses. The only thing that bothered me, however, was the fact that everything from the very beginning was expected. There is literally no turning points in this movie. Everything one expects to happen, actually does happen. However, this does not change the fact that the movie was just amazing and I was pleased to watch it.Deadpool was such a great comedy, solid romance, and a great action movie. All in one.

Excellent comedy and action,"Deadpool was entertaining from start to finish. It immediately establishes its tone - immature comedy mixed with over-the-top violence. It ""breaks all the rules"" successfully. The opening reminded me of Monty Python and the Holy Grail - they can't even take the credits seriously. The humour reminded me of the first few (best IMO) seasons of South Park - happy to offend anyone and everyone but with the focus still being pure comedy. I don't usually like dick and fart jokes much but Deadpool makes them hilarious. It's the juxtaposition of such immaturity with a well-made action movie that makes it work. And it has a story and dramatic moments as good as any recent superhero movie as well.I'm not familiar with Deadpool but it sounds like he's a very popular comic book character. The film-makers (and perhaps Ryan Reynolds in particular) have tried their best to do the character justice. He is irreverent, wise-cracking and likable even if he isn't exactly noble. He says and does what we're too afraid to say and do. He only fights bad guys. And he lives for the woman in his life. Where other superheroes are hypocritical and maintain a facade of moral superiority, at least Deadpool can admit what he is and make fun of everyone including himself while trying to fight evil and help the innocent.I liked the many times the fourth wall was broken. The film-makers know their audience and what kind of movie they're making and it shows. They use the device effectively where appropriate and without it becoming routine. It makes the movie more fun and the darkness easier to swallow. There are so many lines from the movie that I loved, both in concept and delivery. Comedically, it was very satisfying. I don't remember any missed jokes; every chance for irony or sarcasm was taken advantage of.The action was engaging and cool even if similar things have been done before. Every sequence is creative and infused with Deadpool's humour. In one part, he has only 12 bullets and counts them as he uses them. He wastes some and chastises himself but then makes up for it by killing 3 henchmen in a line with one bullet. It's a good sign if you can't tell whether you're enjoying the action or comedy more. I liked the fight choreography and even though some CGI must have been used, there seemed to be a lot of impressive stunt work. Seeing bodies flip and impact solid objects is just inherently exciting.This movie was a great introduction to Deadpool. His origin story was well done. It's pretty dark but it's nice to see something so odd and unique being presented sincerely. Comic books deserve proper film adaptations. The film makes good use of non-linear storytelling near the start. It's never confusing and the order of events is logical in balancing action and getting to know how Wade Wilson became Deadpool.You could say every person is flawed with good and bad qualities. But some people make you feel good, they make you laugh. And some people are self-deprecating and accept their mistakes and are open about their short-comings. Deadpool is like one of those people whose company you always enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The comic book movie we have been waiting for,"So, Deadpool is incredible. This really is the comic book movie we have been waiting for.This film is an incredible adaptation of the ever so popular dirty mouth anti-hero that is Deadpool. And it is not only an incredible adaptation, it is an incredible film. Tim Miller did a fantastic job on this film, and you can really see how much fun they had making it.Ryan Reynolds was born to play this character. His performance was incredible. It was energetic, charismatic and you could tell that he was having the time of his life playing this character. And he really brought this character to life. He played the emotional parts well and his delivery of the jokes was stellar. Every performance in this film was great. There were no weak performances at all, they all delivered their lines perfectly and there was no stale performances, they all worked well as these characters.The CGI was good for the most part. There were times where you could really tell it was CGI. For example the scene where Ed Skrein (Francis) is on top of his base (I guess it's his base) and it looked like a video game.The action scenes for the most part were great. They were fast paced and very violent. People get ripped in half, lose their heads and it was incredibly fun to watch. However in a particular car chase scene the editing was very quick and the scene became very chaotic and it was quite hard to see what was actually happening. But overall it's fantastic.The cinematography was good, nothing special. The best shots were the close ups on Deadpools face whenever he went to say a one liner. And there were some very good slow motion scenes that were very well shot, the camera was still and you could really take in the action. There is practically no shaky cam, therefore allowing us to actually see what the hell is happening.This movie is hilarious. It has a lot of raunchy humor that doesn't go over the top and probably 80% of the time is hilarious. There are also a lot of funny references to other comic book characters and films that were really well done. My personal favourite being when Colossus is pulling him and Deadpool says ""Dead or alive, you're coming with me"". The humor is both smart and incredibly raunchy. My most clever and funny scene in the whole film would have to be when he is fighting in the car and then says ""Have you seen this man?"" whilst holding up a picture of himself, as a taunt to the enemies. It was so incredibly well done and Ryan Reynolds delivery of the line was perfect.The fourth wall breaks are also fantastic. Every time he talks to the camera it always has a purpose and isn't just some stupid gimmick. In fact the best fourth wall break is actually the end credit sequence.Speaking of credit sequences. The opening credit sequence was fantastic. Instead of saying ""Directed by Tim Miller"" it says ""Directed by an overpaid (bleep)"", at least as far as I can remember it says that. (stupid IMBb, you can't swear) This movie just takes the (bleep), out of everything. And it's great! Oh and also the Stan Lee cameo is great, don't want to spoil it. But it involves naked women.The main story is told in a very cohesive and interesting way. Instead of doing what most comic book movies do, where they tell it in a linear narrative, where it shows the origin at the beginning and then reaches the point where he is a fully fledged hero. This starts of straight into him being a bad-ass, cuts to the origin and then keeps cutting back. And each time it cuts back to bad-ass Deadpool to Wade Wilson there is obviously Deadpool talking to the audience and it's great. But the main story is actually rather interesting. I love his origin story and the love story that the film is basically about, is actually really good. You care for the two of them. It is sometimes cheesy, but that's the point. This is Deadpool we are talking about.So, overall this movie is emotional, heartfelt, funny, fun, clever and overall a really entertaining movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Dumb movie,"Predictable story with no twists. Not funny at all. Very very conservative boring plot. All movie goers (appr. 35 yesterday evening) were disappointed. I wonder, how is it possible that Deadpool got such a high rating on IMDb. Even adolescent kids in the movie were bored after 20 minutes of pseudo-action without any sense. The plot seems to have been written by unimaginative conservative men, who wanted to make business by trying to give the main character an anarchic behavior. Didn't work out. Deadpool is a simple conservative guy, who is not interesting at all. Not what he is doing, not what he is suffering, not what he is loving. An empty character. Nobody will feel for him or with him. Out of the cinema, I cannot even remember why he was part of that - ergh? - movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Fun and Naughty,"The X-men universe expands a step wider thanks to the unusual mutated tones of storytelling compared to other Marvel's superheroes that surprisingly turns out very effective and brilliant. Despite a formulaic yet expected superhero plot, the non-linear narrative by slipping the several action sequences together with flashbacks added with the heavy adult-related hilarious jokes throughout the film are wildly entertaining. The film stays faithfully to the characteristics of Deadpool - both humors and violence, which are perfectly portrayed by Ryan Reynolds, who is definitely the right actor to suit the character. The romantic chemistry between Wilson and Vanessa is emotionally engaging and convincing compared to Wolverine, making it a great option for Valentine outing. Changing his suit from green to red, Reynolds certainly has a lot of fun time in this non-family-friendly superhero adventure and the overall outcome has made the classic Deadpool shines among the other superheroes from the same studio.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
This ain't no X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"Speaking as a Deadpool fan this movie is just as good as I could hope for seeing Fox's track record as late.The movie itself is pretty straight forward which the trailers essentially told you the whole movie. That's not to say that it was bad but it did take an unusual narrative structure to tell it's story to help stand apart from current Marvel and DC films.Even the easter eggs and breaking of the fourth wall help to enhance the movie in the sense that it knows what it is as a movie and what movie universe it is set in because it helps to drive the movie forward and even point out some of it's own plot holes.The R rating is well deserved in my opinion. It is not for kids. Take the violence of Daredevil, sex scenes of Jessica Jones and mild emotional tones of The Dark Knight trilogy and you get Deadpool.In the end it may be a Fox produced movie set in the X-Men Universe but it's so different of style you'd think it was set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Highly Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Exactly What a Fan Would Hope for, and More","I will start off by saying that there are a few stipulations to my rating for the more casual movie-goers.It is not a movie like other Marvel movies or even superhero movies in general, nor is it intended to be.It is very loyal to the source material so people who are fans of the series/ people who understand the essence of the Deadpool character will have a great time.It is not a movie I would take kids under the age of maybe 16 to (unless you're a cool parent). If you are you are a younger person going to the movie, I would really recommend going without your parents, it would be pretty awkward at times otherwise.(Additionally if you are from a part of Canada {like myself} where the movie is rated 14A, you should know that rating really stretches the limits of what can be considered a 14A movie.)If you are fine with movies that feature lots of swearing, violence, and nudity, then it is great for you.With these points in mind, I loved the movie. It's really clever, nice simple story and with a nice pace that doesn't devolve into some of the annoying superhero movie tropes. For fans of Tarantino's style of humour and violence, this is the perfect movie. At times it can be really raunchy, but it still has its heartwarming moments. I'll probably return to the theatre to see it at least once more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A solid origin,"The 2016 box office hit Deadpool tells the origin story of the antihero Deadpool. The performance of Ryan Reynolds is stunning, and turns a potentially disgusting or scaring character into a likable one. The film would have become a failure if it were another actor. Deadpool is a nobody in comic books but an instant success in the film industry, largely thanks to the underlying comedic tone. People began to realize that R-rated non-family-friendly movies could be even more popular than PG-13 ones if they were entertaining enough.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Marvel Studios Goes for its First R-rating,"Marvel Studios embraces it's R-rated but hugely comical Deadpool, while keeping the typical superhero formula, starring Ryan Reynolds as the titular 'Merc with a mouth.'Most people know the fictional anti-hero for his insane mentality, offhand humour, and downright positive attitude under fire, all the while hacking and slashing his victims to shreds in the most difficult of battles. From his humble beginnings in the early 90's, as a comic-book super villain, he rose to the top of popularity for his offhand comments, unique narration, and violent nature. Depicted as a mercenary wearing a strikingly non-camouflage red outfit with black panda eyes, underneath lies a physically disfigured and mentally insane man with a heart of gold. He likes the banter, and even during some of the most important comic book events (his Civil-War entries are some of my personal favourites).The film takes its own liberties, with its twisted sense of humour, tongue in cheek references (to past movies), and a hyper-level of violence. We get a lot in terms of who Wade Wilson was before he dawned the red pyjamas of revenge. His life as a mercenary isn't glamorous... it's actually impoverished. He's cocky and handsome, and the story begins right in the middle of his revenge, against the man who tortured him nearly to death and took away any chance of having a real life.Of course the movie detracts from the original comics in terms of his origins, which is not bad actually, but it was a lot more melodramatic than I was expecting in parts. Wade discovers he has cancer and seeks out a cure by requesting the help of an underground medical group that is illegally testing gene mutations on people (technically making Wade a mutant). His whole 'Weapon-X' origin story from Deadpool's previous incarnation is thrown right out the window, spat on, and stomped into the ground. It's not surprising considering how terrible Ryan Reynolds was as his first induction as Wade Wilson / Deadpool in ""X-men Origins: Wolverine"" (2009). Personally, I would have loved to see a more insane version of Deadpool, with the voices in his head that are constantly talking to him, his widely accepted acts of domestic terrorism, and violent slapstick comedic nature (instead of Reynolds ongoing commentary and pop culture references).This movie does have a lot of things I hate about the superhero genre. The simplistic 'get the bad guy' plot line, inconsistencies with story, a villain who doesn't deliver any kind of threat at all, the exceptionally obvious plot holes. Also, some of the jokes fell flat for me at times, and I was hearing some painfully forced laughter in the theatre when I saw this. But it is unique, very funny at times, and it's as violent as you would expect from this character.Worth a watch6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"An outrageously violent, profane and all around fun experience","Second time's the charm as Fox redoes Deadpool in his very own movie after the debacle that was X-Men Orgings: Wolverine back in 2009. Again played by huge fan of the comic, Ryan Reynolds, but with a much better understanding of what it is that makes Wade Wilson so special for his fans, this proves to be exactly the movie that we were expecting. However, that is not to say that to enjoy this you must be a knowledgeable comic book fan or even a Deadpool fan at all.The audience is properly introduced to the character, his world and his peculiar set of values in a way that if you pick up any New Mutant story tomorrow, you will know exactly what to expect from The Merc with a Mouth.That is, the same that you are getting in Tim Miller's feature directorial debut: violence, profanity, fourth wall breaking, pop culture references, comedy and non stop fun.This might not be a masterpiece but that is not what it's supposed to be nor was it trying to. What it will most likely end up being is the most fun comic adaptation of a year that is filled with them and that is no small accomplishment.Highly recommend it, just knowing before hand that this is in no way like the Disney Marvel movies. Probably best to leave kids under 13 at home. Helmed by Miller (Most definitely with some input by star/producer Reynolds) who got the best out of the cast, this is not the hero we needed or the hero we deserved. It's the ass kicker we wanted.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
comedy of 2016,"Deadpool has come at the perfect time. With the current superhero obsession we've seen at the cinema, a film like Deadpool is the perfect antithesis to the over saturation of comic book adaptations. He's a crude, rude pun-making machine, who also has an affinity for breaking the fourth wall, addressing the audience directly.We've seen Ryan Reynolds take on comic book characters before, but gratefully, so has this movie. Deadpool is constantly self-aware, satirically meta, and hilariously open about Reynold's past misfires. It was beautiful to see a film directly discuss what we're already thinking in our head.Deadpool works as pure action entertainment, as well as an over-the- top comedy. It's a revenge tale, a love story, an origin story, and a damn good time. Justice has finally been done to the ""Merc with a Mouth."" Is it the next Citizen Kane? No. Is it the perfect Deadpool movie? You bet.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Hilarious, Action-Packed & Indeed Kicks Ass!","worldwide and for years as well it has taken so long to get a film adaptation made for the big screen. Though the character was featured in the weak X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the appearance of him wasn't considered worth it as his appearance had been altered and wasn't given the proper character treatment to win over the fans. Finally, after years of development hell. Ryan Reynolds reprises Deadpool in the way that sticks true to it's source material and the results are worth the ticket price and time to watch.I won't give away too much on plot details but it does play out as both an origin story and a revenge plot that breaks away from the traditional 'superhero' movie. It charts the beginning of Deadpool as a wise-cracking, foul-mouthed and really abstracted anti-hero, showcasing how he had earned his powers and what made him become this figure. I think the plot itself is great and it doesn't drag itself once in the film and best of all it doesn't take a whole movie to establish the main character's origin unlike a certain film from last year (coughing ""Fantastic Four"").In terms of acting, there are solid performances throughout but the best of the bunch would definitely be Reynolds as Wade Wilson/Deadpool. This is possibly his best performance in film to date, though I have watched Reynolds in other great films such as The Change Up, Safe House, The Voices and even Buried but this role in particular is often seen and considered a 'redeeming role' as previously he had played the role of Deadpool before in XMO: Wolverine and of course the cheesy but bad Green Lantern for DC. His delivery on humour is present throughout and when things get slightly serious he does what he does best and lightens the moment. The supporting cast handle themselves as well as Reynolds, with 'Game of Thrones' actor Ed Skein, 'comic refief' T.J. Miller, 'the more tougher female than Ronda Rousey' Gina Carano and the lovely Morena Baccarin giving their best to keep the story's characters great. Only minor negative to say was the film's villain wasn't given enough polish as to show why he was bad (though we are shown why he's a threat to Deadpool and was just as powerful as he was) but we aren't given a true purpose villain that wants to dominate the world but thankfully Skein does give his best throughout in both terms of acting and stunt work.Direction is strong from first time director Tim Miller, he keeps the film moving along in a decent pace that's not rushed and the production value set for the film is quality assured as costume design, visual effects and make up are all worthwhile and it's script is pretty polished throughout with humour, exciting action set-pieces and the best 4th wall breaks/ meta humour I've seen in years (the knocks at both Wolverine, GL and even the trouble to get a Deadpool movie made are hilarious in particular) .Overall, Deadpool is a blast of a movie that packs action, comedy and superhero cliché's into one and even pokes fun of not only itself but breaks the 4th wall in wonderful ways. Only a fault with its villain in terms of character development, Deadpool will leave you leaving the cinema in the most awesome way possible and stick around after the credits for a cool surprise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A very fun movie that has lots of bad language and funny scenes and jokes,"This is not one to bring a youngster along with or for anyone that is offended by offensive language. It is funny and quite adventurous and like all Marvel films, Stan Lee has a short cameo.

They just want to keep you there but it is very cute. Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarat are great in it, (they all are), But I especially liked her. I watched her in so much in Homeland that it's tough to lose when she is in the film. I also really like the quick reference to one of the short little mutants as Ripley in ""Alien 3"".

Funny Violent Creative,Who knew a character like Deadpool would get his own movie. It was unexpected for me and I really had alot of questions and suspicions in my head but after watching it I was pretty impressed.The story was solid with a sense of scale to it with the origin of his character coming in as 10 min flashbacks while in the present the plot would have a nice pacing to it. It was beautifully directed. The writing was just golden. The music and sound choices were really good too especially the music. Flawless visuals with great CGI and effects. And the characters were good too and had a sense of purpose in the flim intead of just being there as cardboard pieces.Overall an enjoyable and definitely a worthy addition to one of the best marvel movies.Memorable: So so Rewatchable: Maybe...,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"There's no denying Deadpool is hilarious, but...","Deadpool has outperformed all R-rated movies at the box office this weekend, and audiences couldn't be happier. After all, it is a gamechanger for the types of movies studios might take risks on. Additionally, everyone seems to love it. But is it actually any good?Even before the first line of dialogue, Deadpool kicks off with a bang, with a hilarious and appropriate opening credits sequence. The action that follows is equal parts brutal and comedic, and soon, Deadpool takes us back to the beginning of his story. As a matter of fact, he tells us he's going to do that.From the opening scene, Deadpool would appear to break all the rules- breaking the fourth wall, spewing countless profanities in a superhero movie, and having that superhero actually be a murderous psychopath- but in fact, Deadpool is structured like many superhero movies from before Marvel Phase II. It's an origin story, and despite its constant barrage of jokes that poke fun at many of the tropes of superhero movies, Deadpool is actually pretty conventional. This aspect I found to be rather disappointing, because in any meta-film, all the rules can be broken because they exist in our world too. Yet, Deadpool remains confined to the world of the screen, despite acknowledging a world outside of it.Still, that doesn't mean Deadpool isn't a fun film. Outside of a brief respite in the second act, nearly every line of dialogue has a punchline, and there's no joke too low-brow for Deadpool to touch on. This movie is as crass as they come, like many R-rated comedies of recent years. What sets it apart is that the script is so air-tight and fast-paced, it never feels like it's reaching for jokes. Rather, it feels as though the writer tapped into the devil on everyone's shoulder and channeled it every nook and cranny of the script. Anyone who has sat through any superhero film, even if they loved it, has at some point felt indifferent about the genre and its tropes as a whole, and Deadpool mocks every single of those tropes, despite also using them as the vehicle for its plot.The movie is funny enough that even conservative types who don't enjoy low-brow humor will burst out laughing at least once in the film. There's no denying the movie is hilarious. However, I feel the movie really shines in its second act, when things start to get real. The characters, who were previously one-dimensional are actually given some depth. It's a sobering few scenes in a movie drunk with comedy. It proves that the writers are even smarter than the humor of the film, and honestly, could have made a better film. Instead of delicately balancing the hilariousness of the first act, and the darker humor and drama of the second act, it returns to pure comedy for its third act, and it starts to feel a little past its welcome. There's a lot of potential shown in glimpses, or entire scenes of Deadpool, that go largely untapped in the final act when it retreats into familiar territory.Perhaps, in a movie so blunt, the writers felt it best to play it safe in the narrative structure of the film. After all, the studios took a big risk and were often worried about the film. They wanted to make it PG-13. They cut $7 million from the budget shortly before production. They were worried it would fail. Its enormous success has proved them horribly, horribly wrong. Perhaps the writers will up the ante for the second film. I hope they do, because for all the enjoyment I felt watching Deadpool, I also felt letdown. Whether you feel as I do, or hate the film, or love it, Deadpool's success is extremely important to the movie industry as a whole, which has been dominated by the monotonous churning-out of safe, formulaic superhero films, and hopefully that will give the writers more room to take even bigger risks in the inevitable sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Good movie made for fans who can overlook imperfections,"Look, comedy is hard. Action comedy is especially hard, and Deadpool is a dark comedy comic book hero. It should not be surprising that the movie based on him can be witless at times. There are some jokes that are genuinely funny, but many of them are just dumb.The quality of a joke is in the eye of the beholder, but the life expectancy of a joke depends on its relevance and the humour in Deadpool is very centred on pop-culture, referencing various celebrities, obscure movies, and superhero characters, which means that this movie is not going to be nearly as enjoyable a few years from now.It is not only the humour but the whole movie feels that like it is only meant to exist and be enjoyed now. The X-men academy and the characters from the X-men universe show up without much introduction because the film expects you to know those things, which in turn makes this movie feel like a page between some two other bigger superhero productions. What's going to happen to all these movies, once the whole superhero multiverse hype goes away in a few years from now?On top of its insubstantial relevance, Deadpool has issues that are endemic to superhero movies and are really starting to get annoying. Why does Deadpool put so much effort in trying to avoid bullets, considering that his superpower is immortality? How did one of the characters, who is not a superhero, manage to survive what should clearly be a fatal fall? Do we really need another ""I got your girl"" villain? Maybe this is now accepted by audiences, but it doesn't have to be this way.This viewer read a few Deadpool comic books and has been a fan since before he was cool. I thought those comics were genuinely funny. Perhaps it's this light fandom I have that made me cringe at the movie from time to time. Did they get the character right? Well, the 4th wall breaking is technically there, and the dark comedy is technically there and the general concept is all there, but this film is really just Two Guys, a Girl and a Deadpool Place. It's not just Deadpool but Ryan Raynold's goofy Deadpool. It's Marvel factory's Deadpool.I realise this review is coming off rather negative. Could Deadpool be better? Yes, the jokes could be less corny, the camera work during the action could be clearer, the fighting choreography could be less nonsensical and less reliant on CG, some of the plot points could be less cliché. But it could've also been much worse if this movie came out in the 90s. The various issues Deadpool has don't break it. The Deadpool himself looks on point.I found it to be less enjoyable for the comedy and more for just being a polished superhero movie. The acting is good, if you do not mind Ryan Reynolds' delivery. The chemistry between characters is good; The villain is shallow but surprisingly charismatic. The action looks cool, if you don't try to overanalyse it like I do.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Possibly a little too full on, but still a fun and amusing ride","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningFormer mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) now ekes out a living as a sort of odd job man for hire when people need the frighteners laid on. Things perk up when he meets Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), the love of his life, and they look set to live the rest of their lives together-until he is hit with late stage cancer in several of his most vital organs. All seems lost, until he is approached by a mysterious agency that says they can cure him, as well as giving him superhuman abilities. It's all just a cruel front, though, so the villainous Ajax (Ed Skrein) can use him to experiment on. Left hideously disfigured, Wade re-invents himself as Deadpool, the ultimate wise-ass, wise-cracking, indestructible tough guy superhero there is.The whole superhero franchise is placed on such a pedestal these days, like the ultimate symbol of high art against which others must compete, so it was begging for something to come along that stripped it of its pomposity, and play out as more of a parody. Deadpool, if it does nothing else right, hits this mark perfectly, from the flashy opening title sequences where insults are replaced by way of crediting the producers and stars of the film, to Reynolds's relentlessly dry, wise-cracking delivery. On this front at least, it works.The reverse story-telling style was something that had taken a little break for a while, but director Tim Miller gives it a second-coming here, a little over-bearing on what is such a short and simplistic tale. The sarcastic humour is what gives it its distinctive charm, but the hand that feeds it becomes its chalice, by at times feeling a little too in your face and full on, even in interludes when a more sombre tone would have fitted.The inclusion of two X-Men characters as comic relief serves to highlight the leap between two CGI creations, and a guy bedecked in a homemade suit, and further highlights how Deadpool stands alone in the crazy Marvel universe. But stand alone he does, and, while at times this feels a little overdone, it's still a funky, funny adaptation of one of Marvel's trickier characters. ***",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

There are also some too obviously predictable scenes. The main villain, Ajax, is a major drawback, as a much better actor was needed to be casted for this important role.

A solid change from standard superhero films.,"In an age of never ending superhero films it's nice to come across a film like Deadpool. Deadpool tells the story of a mercenary named Wade Wilson who becomes a test subject for a shady organization after discovering he has cancer. After surviving he becomes a mercenary bent on revenge calling himself Deadpool.The plot of the movie is very formulaic and true to form. The real delivery of Deadpool instead comes from it's sense of humor. Deadpool is self referential, crude, but also a lot of fun.

I know I am a comic book character.,"Deadpool, masterfully played by Ryan Reynolds is very entertaining, with a lot of funny jokes and not much else.By the end of the initial sequence, the novelty will wear off, and you'll left wonder if there's anything left to see. There isn't. What follows is a torrent of one-liners between the occasional (more violent than usual) fight scene. Most of the jokes have no build up, are dick-related or pop culture references and are delivery in such an abrupt manner that you become numb to it. Worst of all, the lead characters can only interact through these jokes and seem incapable of any other kind of speech, and that's a shame.It's almost impossible to relate in any way to these characters. Some of them come as bigoted, others as one-dimensional. There's no progression, no struggle and barely any conflict. The film starts at the end and doesn't add much more to the beginning.Bound to an origin story, most of its shortcomings come from the wish of the creators to stay as close to the comics as possible. The film would certainly benefit from more creative freedom and more room to breathe.Deadpool can by appreciated by it's mere existence and by the self- aware nature of the character. It's in the meta segments that Deadpool is at it's best. But in the end, it never delivers on the promise and fails to satirize its counterparts, becoming one more addition to the super-hero movie in the process - one where it's impossible to disassociate the man inside the suit, Wade, to it's alter ego, Deadpool.Although there's much room for a much more interesting (and already confirmed sequel) Deadpool is exactly what one is expecting and that's disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

I was worried it would get to be too self-referential, but the pace was perfect and most every thing worked perfectly.If you want more, interesting, fun movies made, go see it. I still can't believe they made a movie like this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"The ultimate anti-superhero film, a game changer and a humour festival. Make sure you wear the yellow pants so that no one can see you...","Deadpool is definitely one of the most original, creative, unique films (superhero or not) ever made, and it completely shattered all huge expectations i had. So what matters to say:The story is really, really simple. It's an origin story with a revenge story, but the narrative is told in a really fun way, inducing a lot of curiosity and investment. And being this simple is what actually makes the screenplay so good, because it as time to do só much more, like comedy.It's a comedy with action, not the other way around, though there's plenty of action, and the pace is super fast. There's insane action scenes, with epic showdowns, though the film is very small scale, and once again this is what makes it so good, because it goes against everything you are used to see.This is one of the most consistent films I've ever seen, from the very first second (where you watch a credits sequence bound to be a classic, setting up the mood in the most perfect way possible) to literally the last one (where you have a post credits sequence that can top the one from the avengers, because of how it plays with the concept and the audience), it constantly delivers and is constantly perfect. I can count on one hand how many films (all comedies) in history made me laugh so hard, and constantly, and i don't think i ever saw an audience laugh so much in a theater, ever! the humour is without equal, with a million jokes, i really cant imagine how someone could come up with so much great stuff for the entire film. The writers really deserve a lot of praise.The film jokes about everything literally. About fox, how it was made, the marvel films, its system and clichés, tons of other movies, Ryan Reynolds, itself, anything you can imagine, its a pop culture galore, and you will probably enjoy it a little more if you know all about it, though the best part is that its designed so that you can enjoy it even if you don't know.Its a festival of violence for sure, and it earns its R rating. Ryan Reynolds owns the role and basically gives an unforgettable performance, and the rest of the cast is also quite incredible, and the one that can actually be at the same level as Reynolds is the amazing Morena Baccarin.The visual effects are great, but not perfect, and it could have benefited from a bit bigger budget for this, but it isn't the most important thing, not by a long distance. The score is really great, though not what it could be and i felt that it didn't add much to the film actually.Deadpool is the ultimate anti- superhero film, a game changer that will actually make the people behind superhero movies to open their eyes and take things to a new level. Its super fast, super energetic, with a style without equal, mostly thanks to breaking the fourth wall and dark humor approach. Its surprising, as it is different from everything you are used to see in a superhero film. Its a laugh festival, that you have to make sure to wear the yellow pants so no one can see you... Its a film were you are instantly invested and in love with the characters, that no matter how comic and violent it is, it has a huge heart. And everyone, from the writers to the director, to the cast, should have all the praise possible for creating such a perfect film.Given that this is bound to be a huge success, and the second x-men trilogy is ending, it's a foregone conclusion that a new era is about to come, one where Deadpool will be in everything.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Hilarious, Smart, and Well-Paced","Fans of Deadpool have waited at least 7 years for the ""Merc with a Mouth""to get his own film, and finally we have it, but even better is after the wait it delivers. Ryan Reynolds is perfectly cast as Deadpool, and his dedication to getting the character right forms a true portrayal of a character that is very hard to get right, as we learned 7 years ago. Deadpool is hilarious, bitingly smart, and paced like the foul mouthed energizer bunny from hell. In an interview Reynolds said this film has been in production for 11 years, it would seem that the long wait helped the film, because by the time they finally made it, everybody involved wanted to get it right.Deadpool is genuinely hilarious film, by that I mean there are multiple times where everybody in the theater laugh hysterically. The film is even funnier for those that love, and know all about comic book films, because it makes snide comments about the studio and the genre all throughout. Fans of the character will appreciate the fact that Deadpool doesn't pull any punches, it's hilarious from the opening credits to the post credits scene. On top of that Reynolds comedic chops are perfectly complemented by the foul mouthed anti-hero.It shouldn't come as any kind of a surprise that Deadpool is a meta film, as the character's trademarks are breaking the fourth wall, and poking fun at other comic book characters. The film manages to avoid being clichéd, because of it's meta film approach and while not dodging all clichés it winks when it uses one. For those that have seen or genuinely obsess over comic book films, the film is littered with snide pokes at the genre, and a warning for those interested these pokes come early and often. The film is witty to a fault, and honors the character perfectly.From the hilarious opening of the film to the post credits scene the pacing of the film is frenetic. The film begins with a bang, and brilliantly tells it's story in a non-linear format that keeps the film from ever feeling slow. It would have been nice if the low budget hadn't been so noticeable, despite the fact that it gives Deadpool plenty of fodder. One thing that seemed poorly done was the Colossus character, because he's featured in the other X-Men films as a completely different character in look and personality.In the end lovers of the deadpool character will love the film, because it's faithful to everything the character embodies. The film is smart, funny, well-paced, and builds off Reynolds performance to make a genuinely entertaining film. The film has a few small flaws that are few and far between, but overall succeeds in respectfully bringing ""The Merc with a Mouth"" to the big screen. Note that this film is very mature, but when looking for a great film for an adult's night out this film is perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Must Watch Movie!,"No review, can do this justice to how amazing this movie is.

It doesn't slow down and i never wanted the movie to end. its so great at telling his origin story. the jokes are so great and funny, i had to repeatedly wipe tears out of my eyes, and catch my breathe from laughing so hard. the action scenes are incredible. if you want to watch the movie, watch it with a crowd in a cinema, its more enjoyable that way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
.Funny and Irreverent,"Deadpool, starring Ryan Reynolds, is the cinematic origin story for the ""Merc with the Mouth"" Marvel superhero. It follows Wade Wilson, a wise-cracking anti-hero who becomes the titular character after participating in a body enhancement program to overcome cancer.What really makes this film work is its humor. From the opening credits to the closing credits, the jokes flow in a rapid fire of obscenity, vulgarity, and irreverence. The film frequently breaks the fourth wall and takes aim at pop culture elements ranging from movie studios to Ryan Reynolds himself. I was expecting a funny movie. What I got was a hilarious movie. Reynolds absolutely nails the role of Wade Wilson/Deadpool. He has the perfect personality and screen presence to embody the snarky, anti-heroic character. His timing and delivery are impeccable. It was also refreshing to see a superhero movie that does not shy away from showing graphic violence. With the R- rating, the filmmakers were able to show much more than your average PG-13, special effects-laden superhero movie. The graphic visuals lent themselves well to the humor and the brutality of the action.While I mentioned ""special effects-laden superhero movies"" as a contrast to this film, there is quite a bit of CGI in Deadpool. Some of it works, some of it doesn't. I was not a big fan of the CGI towards the end of the film. The end sequence did not feel real to me due to what I would call fairly questionable CGI. In addition, while the dialogue of the script is witty and creative, the structure of the story is mundane. It follows the same beats and turns as many of the other superhero origin stories. The film gets away with this for the most part because of its self-awareness, but it would have been nice to have a more original story behind the great dialogue.Overall, this is definitely a film worth watching. People who have been suffering from genre fatigue due to oversaturation of superhero movies may want to give this film a shot. It doesn't reinvent the story wheel, but its dialogue and bloody action raise this a notch above its contemporaries in the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"For years, Marvel's anti-conventional hero Deadpool has been a huge following for comic book fans worldwide and for years as well it has taken so long to get a film adaptation made for the big screen. Though the character was featured in the weak X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the appearance of him wasn't considered worth it as his appearance had been altered and wasn't given the proper character treatment to win over the fans. Finally, after years of development hell. Ryan Reynolds reprises Deadpool in the way that sticks true to its source material and the results are worth the ticket price and time to watch.I won't give away too much on plot details but it does play out as both an origin story and a revenge plot that breaks away from the traditional 'superhero' movie. It charts the beginning of Deadpool as a wise-cracking, foul-mouthed and really abstracted anti-hero, showcasing how he had earned his powers and what made him become this figure. I think the plot itself is great and it doesn't drag itself once in the film and best of all it doesn't take a whole movie to establish the main character's origin unlike a certain film from last year (coughing ""Fantastic Four"").In terms of acting, there are solid performances throughout but the best of the bunch would definitely be Reynolds as Wade Wilson/Deadpool. This is possibly his best performance in film to date, though I have watched Reynolds in other great films such as The Change Up, Safe House, The Voices and even Buried but this role in particular is often seen and considered a 'redeeming role' as previously he had played the role of Deadpool before in XMO: Wolverine and of course the cheesy but bad Green Lantern for DC. His delivery on humour is present throughout and when things get slightly serious he does what he does best and lightens the moment. The supporting cast handle themselves as well as Reynolds, with 'Game of Thrones' actor Ed Skein, 'comic relief' T.J. Miller, 'the more tougher female than Ronda Rousey' Gina Carano and the lovely Morena Baccarin giving their best to keep the story's characters great. Only minor negative to say was the film's villain wasn't given enough polish as to show why he was bad (though we are shown why he's a threat to Deadpool and was just as powerful as he was) but we aren't given a true purpose villain that wants to dominate the world but thankfully Skein does give his best throughout in both terms of acting and stunt work.Direction is strong from first time director Tim Miller, he keeps the film moving along in a decent pace that's not rushed and the production value set for the film is quality assured as costume design, visual effects and make up are all worthwhile and it's script is pretty polished throughout with humour, exciting action set-pieces and the best 4th wall breaks/ meta humour I've seen in years (the knocks at both Wolverine, GL and even the trouble to get a Deadpool movie made are hilarious in particular) .Overall, Deadpool is a blast of a movie that packs action, comedy and superhero cliché's into one and even pokes fun of not only itself but breaks the 4th wall in wonderful ways. Only a fault with its villain in terms of character development, Deadpool will leave you leaving the cinema in the most awesome way possible and stick around after the credits for a cool surprise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Marvel Sliding Down the Tubes,"I think it is too bad that they are warping the super hero genre with all of the stupid juvenile sex jokes. It's like they wanted to mix the humor of the movie 'Superbad' which is aimed at that kind of purulent dung. How many F bombs, nudity and references to masturbation can your movie contain? They even included a scene of cartoon characters humping. Supposedly Ryan Reynolds visited sick kids dressed up like Deadpool, warping sick kids minds one child at a time. 'Gee mom and dad, can I see the Deadpool movie? My new hero is Deadpool.' As one who grew up reading Marvel comics this is very depressing. I'm sure this will be only the beginning of perverting the franchise the box office count was so very successful. This world is getting sicker and sicker.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I don't even LIKE the Marvel movies...,"...but DEADPOOL was awesome! It was great to find an action-comedy that assumes I'm an adult.It's dumb, it's profane, it's utterly silly, and I loved every minute of it (literally, right from the opening ""credits""). Is there a story in there? Yeah, I guess, but it's really just secondary to Deadpool's constant smart-alec riffing. If anyone was considering writing a Marvel spoof screenplay, don't bother; ""Deadpool"" frequently bites the hand that feeds it and skewers the label as thoroughly as anyone could hope.Deadpool ""breaks the 4th wall"" frequently, and even parodies that device by breaking the 4th wall in a flashback WHILE breaking the 4th wall (""That's like, 16 walls!"").Do NOT take kids. This movie revels in gratuitous violence, graphic language, and juvenile humour, and makes no apologies for any of it. This is an ""R"" rated movie and comes by it honestly. If you're good with that, though, the odds are good you'll laugh your butt off.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The wait is over,"Deadpool is directed by Tim Miller and stars Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, T.J. Miller, and Ed Skrein. First off, when they finally say their doing this movie. I was so excited for it but I was also worried how will they handle this amazing and funny character. I was 100% wrong. They made Deadpool fantastic, better than fantastic. Everything thing was done so well, the acting, action, comedy, storytelling, everything. Ryan Reynolds is truly this whole movie. He did an amazing job, born to play this role. T.J. Miller was great too, I feel like they could of used him more but he was still funny. The villain was good, nothing special just a good villain. The action scenes were fantastic, fast and surprising very funny too. The only negative I had with the movie was the plot, it's be done before and everything like that but it didn't very hurt the overall experience of this amazing move. Also some of humor didn't hit as much they probably wanted too but there's not much of that. Overall Deadpool was the movie that fans wanted for so long, had everything they promised and more.

annoying,"A colleague at work told me that this was going to be a flick I would like. I do like comedy but mostly US humour isn't my thing but I must say, this surely hits it.What I did knew was that it was all about a superhero but there's more than that. My summary says it all. Deadpool, the character, is annoying as hell and that's the reason why you start loving him. The effects used are stunning, some situations are as funny as hell (his small hand and his...) and I surely did laugh with the sex scenes that occur with some holidays. The Halloween part and the teeth while giving his girl oral sex, well, you must just see it. And here we have it, Ryan Reynolds as deadpool does give the best he can and it's an excellent performance. And did we ever see Morena Baccarin more sexy than here as a stripper?But not only the acting is above mediocre as are the effects also references toward other actors and flicks are funny and the score used, well, for the people grown up in the eighties it will be a ride down memory lane.If you go watch it be sure to stay until the end credits are over because you will laugh it out again and he surely tells you the truth about cinema's.After Guardians Of THe Galaxy (2014) and Ant-Man (2015) another excellent superhero flick but this one here with an excellent twist.

Reynolds Plays It Well,"Ryan Reynolds finally plays a comic book character that we was meant for. After the disaster of Green Lantern, years ago, Ryan got his chance to play a role he was destined for.As an R-rated film, and highly discussed by many about how ""this is not a kid's movie"" the film is kind of tame in its uses of adult subject matter.It's a good story, about the vigilante / anti-hero Deadpool. It has strong comedy elements, it plays out realistically, and it really works well as a romance too. It hardly even feels like a comic book movie. I'm hoping the atmosphere of Deadpool 2 is similar.Morena Baccarin was wonderful in the role and fits really well with Ryan. Supporting characters of Colossus and Negasonic seemed forced, however, due to limited budget of licensing for more X-Men characters.Most of the action sequences are fun but some people may not be able to handle them very well due to the gore. Humor is very active in the action scenes and the film's R-rated content keeps light hearted. Aside from some of the kills in the film, the laidback feeling makes me feel that the film is suitable for some kids (depending on age).This was definitely the first must-see of 2016.

"Not as subversive as it looked, but thoroughly competent and often enjoyable","Deadpool, one of the 2016's most hyped movies, follows a mercenary who is subjected to an experiment which turns him into a mutant with superpowers. Sounds like your everyday superhero movie, right? Well, no. As the rather brilliant marketing campaign never stopped repeating, this is not your average superhero movie. Swearing, sex, gore, adult humour and meta jokes add up to a very unique superhero movie which is not for kids. Deadpool is a victim of its overhyping, but it's a good time and at least a bit different from the usual superhero movies. It does have quite a few problems though. In many ways, the plot is generic and while some clichés are mocked, not all of them are. At times the film is too dark. At times the film- and the central character- are unbearably smug and insufferable. Many scenes just feel like the film trying to be as R rated as possible, and the adult nature of the film starts feeling like a gimmick as a result. Not all of the jokes hit, although quite a lot do, and it's pretty entertaining. It's not as different and unique as it looked, but it's still subversive and entertaining much of the time. It is funny, occasionally hilarious, the performances are strong and the visuals are very clever. Possibly the most subversive thing of all is that the romance actually works for once. It's probably not going to age too well and I think people will realize it's not deserving of it's ludicrously high placement on IMDb Top 250 on repeat viewings, but it's a decent enough movie with some very good lines.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Entertained, I was not.Now there are two kinds of bad films, ones that are so bad they are funny and the others that are just bad, unfortunately this falls into the latter category.It would not be possible to put a plot spoiler in this review, since the film has no plot. Basically, someone decided to make a film with the usual explosions, car crashes and gun fire and put a really camp guy in a red suit and give him as many awful unfunny one liners as possible. To perfect the badness of the awful script they found a really bad actor to deliver unfunny lines, although granted, even Al Pacino could not make this script good.The only thing fascinating about this film is the fact that somebody made it, edited it and released it, not noticing how truly awful this film is. If I were an actor, I would be so embarrassed to be associated this film. This really could go down as one of the worst films ever made, but not in a good way.

"Consensus: Deadpool tries too hard to mock the properties that have preceded it, losing potency, originality and its identity in the process.","Ryan Reynolds in a spandex-ish tight superhero suitdoes this movie deliver? Let's find out.I think Deadpool definitely is a strong addition to the comic-book movie-verse, boasting strong performances and above-average action set pieces. Does it do enough as a Deadpool origins story? Not quite. Deadpool is far too self-aware for its own good. The film tries so hard to be different it actually disappointingly falters in its attempt to be original.The director seems too inexperienced to accurately meld all the wild elements in this fun and quirky Deadpool script. The writers of ""Zombieland"" nail the one-liners and most of the self- referential sadomasochistic non-sensical commotion that goes with it.Is there such a thing as trying to be TOO cool? Pop-culture is pop-culture for a reason. Quotable film lines are deemed classics because of the audiences that make them so. You can't coerce your way into pop-culture fandom, rather you earn your place there. All in all, Deadpool had me leaving the theatre with ambivalent feelings. I do not know exactly where I stand when it comes to liking an anti-hero who keeps on reminding us he is a reluctant superhero while being in a spoof movie of the subject he is making fun of. Does that make any sense? The film definitely is a satire of the comic-book superhero formula; alas the execution of that satire is far from perfect. Deadpool is enjoyable for its jokes and to watch Ryan Reynolds sadistically inflict pain on his bevy of hopeless criminals- I think the audience secretly felt more pleasure as we watched him ingeniously come up with dozens of ways to perform his lethal duties.Fans of the character will be pleased, comic-book movie fans who have an insatiable desire for unconventional chaotic superheroes will also be content with this adaptation, film fans who care about the plot and cinematic elements will be divided on this one.

A bad movie,"I knew that new flicks tend to get unrealistically high scores on IMDb from all the fans, and still, just bought the tix when I saw 8.7 rating for this, hoping for a ""Guardians of the Galaxy""-like gem.

It was a just a badly written badly scripted movie with good FX budget.I think you will only like it if you are a die-hard fan or a 12-14 year old.Otherwise, waste of time and money.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A Freaking Thrill Ride,"Who knew that an R-Rated superhero movie would be this awesome? Deadpool is probably one of the most extraordinary superhero movies ever created. As a movie based on a superhero, it manages to have all these materials that any superhero fan can have a great time thanks to the top notch writing that would provide a really exciting origin story, violent yet stunning action, bloody and exciting visuals, a cast of charming characters, and a series of hilarious fourth wall breaks. If you are a superhero fan and even a fan of the Deadpool series, I really recommend this movie. However, I do notice that there was one event that almost ruined the movie with debating to censor this movie just to take kids to see this movie. So yeah, I highly recommend for the kids to wait until they're older. Not because of the violence, but for how mature the plot is.

To be honest, Deadpool is playing as Ryan Reynolds. The character really fits perfectly for Reynolds, performance 10/10, acting 10/10, humor 10/10.

Campy fun with drama thrown in,"This movie has plenty of action and outrageous special effects that don't even try to be realistic. There's some dramatic back story, and lots and lots of violence and spraying gore. It's pretty funny too, although the humor is extremely campy. It's as though the old British ""Carry On"" movies were crossed with Quentin Tarantino.The language is bad, there is a good deal of nudity, there are tasteless masturbation jokes, and all-in-all it's a heap of low brow fun.

Fun superhero flick with an extra layer of M-rated sass.,"Deadpool tells the origin story of Wade Wilson, a former member of the military who now takes on justice under his own terms as a mercenary. Wade falls in love with a hooker and as his relationship with her flourishes he ends up getting diagnosed with terminal cancer. In a move of desperation he accepts the offer of a mysterious man that operates in a clandestine lab, who promises him not only the cure of his disease but also greater powers. In an unfortunate incident in this secret lab with one of the operatives, he ends up with a disfigured face. However, he also ends up with the power of fast healing and regeneration, making him almost invincible. DP now faces a life of almost immortality but plans to seek revenge to the man that disfigured him, and also fights to get back the love of his life. DP teams up with X- Men residents Colossus, who spends the entire movie trying to convince DP to join the Xmen, and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, a mutant who comes off as Daria-level cold but snarky teenager, but ends up being a real powerful and reliable sidekick. As a character Deadpool is a blatant mix of Wolverine and Spiderman, but augmented, and then with sarcasm and self-awareness sprinkled all over.DP is really your typical Marvel flick, but what it has going on for it comes thanks to the nature of DP himself. Marvel certainly had some fun with him as he constantly talks to the audience and breaks the fourth wall. There's also a lot of real life pop culture references, several of which take jabs at Ryan Reynolds himself. A recurring joke across the film for example, is poking fun at Ryan's old role as the Green Lantern from the 2011 DC movie. The M rating also allows them to take some liberties on sexual and drug references, swearing, and violence. To be honest yes there was a lot of that, but still it was all very comic-bookish if you ask me. Nothing too out there except for a few semi-shocker scenes.I wasn't too excited about the first half of the movie, I felt that they could have handled DP's origin story better. It didn't seem too credible in the way it was presented. Still it was important to follow everything as it would give context to the happenings in the 2nd half of the movie, which was much more entertaining and let the character fully express himself but now under the actual motives of the plot. This movie isn't very deep; it is actually very straightforward on what it wants to achieve. Which makes it popcorn- flick level good. It is fun, but I don't know if I will care much about it after seeing it the first time.In conclusion, Deadpool really doesn't stray any far from a standard formula of a superhero movie and it is not going to win any outstanding awards, but it at least keeps you engaged with personality and sass. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But it is entertaining and that's what matters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
We walked out of this movie...,"We went to this film not knowing anything about the Deadpool character, but after seeing the positive reviews this film had received, we thought we would give it a try. We had similarly known little about other Marvel characters (X-Men, Avengers), and since we had enjoyed these other films, we thought Deadpool would be a funny and entertaining experience.We didn't walk in expecting it to be anything like the former mentioned films, and we knew this was an anti-hero movie. We aren't particularly turned off by violent movies if there's a purpose to the story, but nothing prepared us for this. The constant on-screen assault we experienced was humorless, pointless, convoluted and cringeworthy.It was after half an hour of constant swearing, graphic violence, smutty innuendo and jokes about cancer before the faint hope that the film would improve disappeared and we walked out.Don't think for a second you can take your kids to this movie.

Finally! An X-Rated X-Men movie,"Hilarious from beginning to end! 
All of these low reviews are from people that must never see rates R comedies or action movies! 
Not only did it show an ""anti-hero"" X-Man, but it successfully blended in a love story as well as showing a convincing origin story. 
Yes there's sex, language and violence but none is inappropriate for a mutant anti hero that is in love and wants to become ""normal"" again. 
I've heard worse language, that is unnecessary and out of place, in many action movies; more ill placed and horribly long runs of violence in movies like The Matrix sequels ( which, by the way, for the most part I enjoyed ) and horror movies; and inappropriate sex scenes in all of the above. 
In this movie, everything fits, which is rare. 
It's rated R so common sense tells you this isn't a kids movie and was never meant to be. 
There are a lot of X-Men movies I'd never watch more then once, mostly because they have become repetitive and far from unique. This was a refreshing change for people like me that are not comic buffs and need the whole back story explained to me from someone who is. 
I would say, if you're have a bad day and need to laugh, watch this movie. It will not disappoint, no matter how many times you've seen it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Subjectivly I loved this movie. But objectivly it stops at good.,"Deadpool tells the story of Wade Wilson who upon being diagnosed with terminal cancer then goes to a shady place with shady people ran by antagonist Ajax. After being cured but disfigured Wade goes after Ajax in order to fix his face.Let me start out by saying that I had a blast watching this movie. I thought the action was outstanding, and found myself laughing at the films crude and sadistic hummer through out the whole runtime. The movie was also incredibly fun. If I was rating this movie purely on how much I enjoyed my self during it I would be giving this movie a perfect 10/10. But upon analyzing it I can only recommend it as good.My reason for only calling it good is because the movie relies mostly on its sense of hummer. And upon analyzing it what I found is that if you find Deadpools hummer chuckle worthy at best you will probably not like this movie nearly as much. Also the plot as well as antagonist are only unique when compared to other marvel movies. Where as if you look at as just a movie it is cookie cutter.In conclusion I had a blast at this movie and any one else with that sense of hummer will. But if you don't share Deadpools sense of hummer you will find it only has action scenes to offer after that. And when more then half of the movie is not an action scene you will be disappointed. And I'm giving this one a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Great Movie,"REDUX (07/23/2024)
Rating: 9.1
Overall, a unique superhero movie that plays to the strengths of Ryan Reynolds by using metacomedy and fourth-wall breaking mixed with action to be true to Deadpool.Direction: Very Good
The direction on a macroscale is very good as it interjects meta humor into traditional comic-book action sequences, and they do a good job laying the groundwork for this movie to be a meta-satire; the direction on a microscale is very good as these scenes really bring out the meta humor and the characters/relationships; the storytelling is very good as they do a good job jumping from past to present to provide an origin story while also showing how far Deadpool has come on his journeyStory: Great
The concept is very unique, as it is a meta-comedy based on an often-overlooked superhero, creating a narrative that really plays to his strengths; the plot structure is unique, as it uses the first half to jump back and forth between the past and the present to set Deadpool's origin story, and after this halfway point, it jumps into the climax; the character writing is very good, as they stay really faithful to the comics in creating DeadpoolScreenplay: Great
The dialogue is really good, as it is filled with metacomedy/fourth-wall breaking, and helps make the movie funny and enjoyable; the humor makes this movie one of the funniest superhero movies ever, pushing boundaries that others have never gone; the foreshadowing is good, as it uses cliches, but borderline parodies them simultaneouslyActing: Pretty Good
Ryan Reynolds: Very Good (Perfectly embodies the role as it feels like he is Deadpool, from his comedic mannerisms to his meta forthwall breaking)
Morena Baccarin: Good (A good love interest and has great chemistry with Reynolds)
Ed Skrein: Pretty Good (Pretty Good Villian)
T. J. Miller: Pretty Good to Good (Pretty Good side-kick to Deadpool)
Gina Carano: Decent (Really isn't given that many lines but plays her part well in the fighting scenes)
Brianna Hildebrand: Pretty Good (Plays the teenager role well)
Karan Soni: Pretty Good (His Indian comedic relief really has a part in the comedy as it helps juxtapose the bad-ass nature of Deadpool)
Rest of the cast: Decent (Nobody feels really outstanding but everyone plays their part)Score: Pretty GoodSoundtrack: Pretty GoodCinematography: Good
Used well to give the action sequences personalityEditing: Very Good
Feels very crisp and helps make this movie feel uniqueSound: Very GoodVisual Effects: Good
A bit dated, but fine for the timesCostumes: Very Good
Deadpool's costume is very iconic, as it stays really true to the comic booksPacing
Pacing is good, as it slows down the pace in the right moments to interject comedyClimax
Climax is a typical superhero climax (mixed with comedic moments)Tone

"""I bet it feels huge in this hand.""","Just rewatched Deadpool before watching Deadpool & Wolverine and haven't seen this since I saw it in theaters. It's still just as fun. I was so entertained the first time I saw it because I was so excited that a Marvel movie is now R-rated. I love the R-rating. This movie would not have been as good without it. The jokes and satire are so hilariously funny and Ryan Reynolds is perfect as Deadpool. Can't imagine anyone else in the role. All the other characters also fit in very well.The film is very unique for being a ""superhero"" film when it comes to the brutality, nudity, the jokes and the breaking of the fourth wall, etc. The story is quite okay and somewhat predictable with a good bad guy.

missed opportunity,"I enjoyed this film a great deal. Few films have the testicular fortitude as this one and Ryan Reynolds found his calling, nobody plays smart ass like this guy. It's funny as hell but could have actually been a great movie as well. It tries to be a satire of the super hero movie (something most super hero movies accidentally do anymore) but what it really is a super hero movie with some (admittedly hilarious) dirty jokes. This film would bump up to a seven or even eight if they cut down the origin story. No super hero origin story will ever be interesting--Nolan's Batman had an interesting one not because the story was good but because it was well photographed. Honestly, I cant wait for the sequel though. The origin will be gone and Reynolds will have more time to do what he does best.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Deadpool Review,"The highly anticipated Marvel comic-book action movie has arrived with Ryan Reynolds in 'Deadpool'. After finding out that Wade Willis has cancer, he is reached out to participate in a series of tests that can not only cure but make him capable of having super strength. When things go bad, Willis is out to seek the man who is responsible for his transformation and save his companion. The film is directed by Tim Miller and also stars Morena Baccarin, T.J. Miller, and Ed Skrein.Wow! This is possibly one of the best comic book adaptations we've seen in some time since 'Captain America: Winter Soldier'. Given the R rating that everyone clamored for it gave the movie a gritty edge in violence and humor; all staying true to the comics that is 'Deadpool'. All of this mounting to a refreshing contrast to the Marvel cinematic universe we all have been used to seeing. Fun is the word you would describe this film; especially the performance given by Ryan Reynolds. Fans of the Marvel universe will be happy to know that the studio did justice to the character and didn't hold any punches in the process.You can read the entire review here at: thecinemascore.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Good, but not perfect","Ryan Reynolds was born to play the role of Deadpool. He even did a decent job of portraying the Merc with a Mouth in the beginning of X- men origins (except at the end where everything went downhill).The movie was everything we could have hoped for in an R-rated Marvel Comics movie, yet I can't help but feel that there was something missing (This is just my opinion and does not reflect everyone else's)Maybe there should have been more violence, more blood, more X-men, more... everything. Maybe when they come out with the sequel there will be more. Just hoping!If you haven't seen the movie, just remember: IT IS NOT FOR CHILDREN!!! THERE IS A REASON WHY IT HAS BEEN RATED R!!!!

"Amazing, just what I've been waiting for!","I write this review as a hardcore fan of deadpool, having read a  ridiculous amount of stories involved with this character. I have  waited years for this movie to be made and leading up to the entire  production of this film I always pictured Ryan Reynolds as deadpool. I  was not wrong in believing he can pull it off. At this moment I believe  that he is the only person who can play this character. Looking passed  the amazing casting of the title character, I believe this movie was  faithful to fans and funny enough for the newcomers. This was clearly a  testing the waters project for 20th century fox. The lack of budget I  believe held back a truly motivated group of people who wanted to push  the limits and basically hit the line that cannot be crossed. The  dreaded R rating. They have put together a film that essentially has  almost no plot, but gives a look at the origin of a character that  people may not have heard of. As a fan of the comics I know that the  story is not exactly canon to the comics but as a fan of Deadpool, I  know that nothing is ever clear in any story he's involved with. This  movie feels like a collection of 4 comics put together in a soft cover  book. The story starts and ends just like any deadpool story you would  read. Loved it but maybe I have a conflict of interest because of the  history I have with the character. Either way I think anyone can find  some humor with this movie unless you're a complete hard ass.

If it wasn't for Ryan Reynolds...,"I honestly think that if it wasn't for Ryan Reynolds, this movie would not have received the high average rating it got on here.

The jokes are funny-ish, the beginning is loaded with unnecessary sex scenes and shots of Reynolds' a**, and towards the middle I was falling asleep because it just seemed like the movie was all over the place and not really going anywhere.One of the most over-hyped movies this year.

Being a different Super hero Movie does not mean it's good Movie overall,"Where will I get a hundred words to describe this ""movie""?The story of this movie is basically a revenge story in a superhero movie, cliché. The reason for the success of this film is the type of character (which most Male audience in the age range between 16 and 25, will enjoy) coupled with spontaneous humor and the jokes with the fourth wall. Of course, the character may be a snort of fresh air for the sub genre super heroes (I do not know there was a sub-genre so-called Super hero/ comic movie genre), but for the movies in general, this here is nothing new to see.Do fans of this kind of movies feel down, when we talk about superhero movies and why do they have to separate them from the ""other"" types of movies? Just because they do not to offend sensitivities? Or they do not want the audience to consider them a ""inferior movie"", so many questions, no answer.Of course here we have all the ingredients that anyone in this range will like. Meaningless violence, even more so with super heroes. Seriously, how to create tension in a film of this type, where the main character has regeneration and if he is cut into pieces, it will regenerate. The action scenes (the most basic element of this type of film) completely lose their impact and tension. I like scenes of action and violence, but the filmmakers have to show the effects of violence on the bodies of characters and its consequences in characters' lives.. Creating violence just to show that it is ""cool"" only creates more violent people. Even focusing solely on this aspect of the film, the film is too stupid. With senseless action scenes. This film, even its most primary purpose, can not perform with quality.In addition to the humorous, mindless action scenes, generic plot, the main character (fun but limited), what does this movie have to offer?Scenes of nudity, spare me.

One of the best comic book movies ever,"I remember the negative, hateful reactions X-Men Origins: Wolverine got for what it did to the awesome character of Deadpool, who is very loved by the fans. At the time I basically knew nothing about the character, so I decided to look into him. What I found was one of the coolest, funniest and most entertaining characters I had ever seen. After so many years, I am happy to say, we finally got the Deadpool movie we deserved.First of all, Ryan Reynolds is perfect for playing the role of Deadpool and he owns every second he's on screen. The thing I like about it is you can actually tell he loves the character and most importantly he UNDERSTANDS the character he is playing. Watching him in interviews just lets you know how much he enjoyed playing the Merc with a Mouth.This is an R-Rated comic book film and it doesn't hold anything back, literally. It is violent, funny, meta. Basically everything I love in a movie. And I mean it probably doesn't get any more meta than this and that's why Deadpool works perfectly because it knows exactly what it is and what it needs to be and it expresses that.The movie is told in a nonlinear way, which absolutely works to its advantage because the plot is very simple, especially as a comic book film, so the nonlinear way of telling makes it feel original. The thing I knew some people were worried about was if the love story was gonna work or not. The answer to that is yes, because everything that happens between Deadpool and his girl feels real, especially knowing her background and who she is and especially because it actually advances the plot of the movie, building our main character.Sure, like most movies, Deadpool has flaws, but they are minimal, and I mean minimal. It did NOT take me out of the experience for the most part. The only two things that kinda bothered me were that they never really explain exactly what his powers are (and considering he jumps abnormally high and does super inhuman back flips, I think it should have been explained more), although it is implied and it doesn't make any sense at all that the eyes of the costume show emotions and that he himself made a suit that is absolutely perfectly made and tactical, but it's so awesome. And who the hell cares anyway? The movie surely doesn't. have to emphasize I am looking at this through a microscope, because I loved every minute of Deadpool. Moshe of the humor works, but upon a second viewing, it seemed to me that they were trying a little too hard to be funny at times.But Deadpool blew me away with its humor, violence and especially the meta. The scenes I loved the most were when they referenced something real or when it made fun of itself. There are some clichés in the movie, like the evil British bad guy and the comic relief character, but the movie makes fun of those clichés. I had a blast with Deadpool, from the opening credits to the post-credits scene, I had a big smile on my face 96% of the time. It's a movie that understands exactly what it is and it executes the things it has to do perfectly.

Balancing out the rating,"I voted it a 10, why because it was exactly what I wanted it to be, fun entertaining popcorn movie...is it on the same level as the Departed or the Godfather...No but as a 1st movie about Deadpool, laying out the back story (because not everyone knows or reads the comics)and introducing characters to the viewers, it did a great job. Movies are like pizza, its all preference...so because I like my pizza with pep and extra cheese is not as good of a pizza that has baby truffles and goat cheese??? No they are just personal preference. I felt the movie delivered so hence my 10, I loved it.Movies get different ratings for different things, and its about about preference and opinion, just like comments on the board here...you have the right to rate a movie what you want and say what you want...the main reason I gave it a 10 is because reviewers like Cedrick Jones gave it a 2 which is absurd. If anyone knows anything about Deadpool he has the mouth of a 5th grade boy. Go see this movie, its fun and popcorn makes anything better.

Okay...But Not Enough,"Deadpool was an okay movie. It was definitely not great, as many would suggest. It was very funny, but that is literally all that it had going for it. The film was extremely anticlimactic - I found myself bored, midway through. Also, the X-Men reference was so forced, I laughed at it. Deadpool was a filler movie - something to entertain superhero film fans, while they wait for the next blockbuster. I am a bit disappointed in myself for spending $4.99 renting it, On-Demand. The film felt like something you rent while hung-over, and - even then - that's not helpful, because you still wake up, wondering why you have a boring movie in your line-up. I would highly suggest that anyone looking for superhero fun go see X-Men: Apocalypse, which is an awesome film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Disappointing!,"Dishonorably discharged Special Forces operative turn mercenary goes on a killing rampage because of his vanity and the side-effects of a miraculous treatment which have saved his life and made him virtually immortal with super strength.Acting was fair, photo direction as well, good dosage on the special effects side. The plot is thin and giving the result, directing did a great job.Unlike most Marvel's movie this one is not about super heroes, the guy is basically a cold blooded revengeful killer. Nothing new here, I guess it's fine, let's forget all of his moral flaws, the guy thinks he is funny. He might be if homosexual sex references are your kind of treats.Torture, sex solicitation, tons of killings, drug references, disfigurement, unicorn sex and un-repentance are few of the example that comes to my mind when I asked myself. How the hell did that thing got rated PG-13 in my area?Giving the genre, I wasn't expecting much. Despite it all, I enjoyed myself and have been surprised with cinematography proceeds not common in the block-buster industry. Not a piece of art, but giving the quality of Hollywood production a worthy 6,8 out of 10 seem fair to me.Please consider living the kids home or you might end-up having a talk about fisting that you are not be prepare for!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Costume Should Have Stayed Green!!!,"First time in a theater since 2005...Walked Out 27 minutes in!!! This is not my Deadpool!!! Seems they were more concerned with the ""4th wall"" and sales instead of continuity. This Hurts!!! I had conversations with people about how I felt DC was winning against Marvel because of realism versus being campy. My argument remains and most likely will stay the same after March 25. This Film is a poor attempt to take the greatness and diversity of a character such as DP and make him an Everyman. You can take some characters and make them relate-able(spell check) but DP is not that guy!!! I never saw grit...instead I saw Ryan Reynolds...I never saw insanity...instead I saw Childish Humor...I never saw a movable character...instead I saw a Meme!!! Unfortunately this is the worst of the Marvel Films ever (To Me) and it was made not for us (Comic Lovers) and the people that see our passion and can only relate through film but for the ""Sheeople"" who like the sensation of hype.Thank You!!!",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
wickedly funny and relentless,"this is the third of Marvel's recent comedic superhero movies (the previous two being Ant Man and Guardians of the Galaxy) and it's the funniest one yet. they might be on to something here...The humor is crude, vulgar, and sophomoric (think Family Guy or Superbad), but it's mostly hilarious and all of the meta and Fourth Wall jokes are pretty awesome.That's not the only thing this fantastic movie has going for it. the action's good, the banter between Deadpool and other characters is top-notch, and the pacing is silky smooth. The movie's less than 2 hours, doesn't have any dull or slow moments, and it grabs your attention from beginning to the end. They flawlessly incorporated Deadpool's fourth wall antics, and from a storytelling perspective the plot moves along smoothly and flashbacks work well when this character's interacting with and guiding the audience throughout.and finally, we'd be remiss if we didn't talk about Ryan Reynolds. It's tough to overstate how challenging this role is. The whole flick is good, but it's success relies heavily on a protagonist who's in 95+% of the scenes and and spends a large bulk of that time rambling and talking to the audience. And Reynolds kills it. He's so convincing it's hard to see anyone else doing this role.So go see this movie! They put maximum effort into it, and it's very entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Let's just say.,"When you go to a movie and the opening credit make you laugh out in hysterics. You know this movie is going to be one funny thrill ride. Deadpool has vaulted itself to the top of my list of best adapted comic book to move adaptations. Ryan Reynolds could not have delivered Wade Wilson to the screen more than what he did. Everything about Deadpool was awesomely funny with a side of twisted and perverted. Definitely not a movie for children and if you did let your child watch this movie, you should be evaluated for common sense.Deadpool is for adults. So please get off it should be kid friendly. We have enough of those, let the adults have some sick twisted fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Awesome movie,"It's really nice to see that studios listen to what the people ask for.The test footage that came out a while back showed the potential of a movie like this. Seeing how people reacted and made videos online the studio actually took notice and put it into production. This is the only movie that nails the Deadpool comics. The characters in this movie all work well, they have chemistry. They redeemed themselves from that horrible x-men origins story. All in all great movie, never a dull moment. Go out and watch it if you haven't. Buy it on blu-ray, show support so that a super hero movie having R rating can still do well in sales.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A definite watch for fans of some raunchy humor and some good violence,"It was a good watch, for those wanting a different flavor of superhero movie. Most of the jokes were on point and the movie didn't take itself too seriously. Ryan Reynolds really did well in the role and his co-comedian TJ Miller made the bar situations a lot more bearable. There were times when the ad-libbing did get noticeable, reminiscent of the table talk during Bridesmaids. Although the pacing of the film did help in alleviating the awkwardness. There were times the story felt a bit rushed, and seemed as if they were just going through a checklist, but the humor did carry a lot of it through well enough, which could become an issue if the jokes aren't your thing. Really enjoyable, but at the end of the day, aside from the humor, it really brings nothing new to the table. I don't plan on watching it again anytime soon, and I don't really see anyone other than big fans of the genre who would clamor for a second taste.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Perfect. From a die hard Comic fan!,"So I just got out of my second viewing of Deadpool, when Marvel studios first kicked off I prayed to god this would happen one day, a Deadpool movie as has been my favorite character since the early 90's with his appearance in New Mutants!So the movie made me very excited and very terrified because this could have just been the biggest fail. Well, it wasn't, everything by Ryan was perfect and I mean perfect, Deadpool is Ryan Reynolds, he nailed it. The costumes where great, they really bought him to life with the Animated eyes, really awesome. The humor was perfect, perfect for an R Rated movie, in Deadpool style well timed and extremely witty!The movie is very very very violent, which I kind of gathered it would be, but even so you found most of it funny. . . The jumper punches at DC and everything else through it where amazing, it's very rare these days you sit in a cinema and everyone is laughing!This movie is violent, funny, smart and exciting, everything you expect from Deadpool when you read the comic and now it's on the big screen.10/10 Can't wait for the second!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Nice Change - Something Original For Once,"I had never heard of 'Dead pool' and i'm certainly not a 'fan boy'of the super hero comics.I liked the look of the trailer so went to see it.It's very graphic, violent, bad language, sexual scenes etc A film not for prudes. But it does seem to work and I found it both funny and entertaining. Ryan Reynolds really excels in the role.Deadpool is a sort of self aware, antihero, cool bad guy who underneath is a sort of good guy. He's also aware he's a comic/film character and talks to the audience - which surprisingly works too. The general plot is pretty typical for the genre but Reynolds as deadpool is what makes it stand out and is virtually continuously funny.My only mild criticism is I think they could have made the plot stronger and enhanced the suffering/development of the Deadpool character.I'd give it 7.5/10 as an action packed unusual superhero romp, that will entertain and amuse for the entire 108minutes.I'd also give it a 9/10 for being original and different. A film that is worth paying to see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A real thrill and extreme funny,"Deadpool , it is the first of eight comic book movies ,whose will come out in this year (2016). It is part of the x-men Francaise which had its ups and downs over the years. Deadpool to summaries is the best meta movie I've seen for a long time and makes justice to the character of Deadpool, as well as the superhero movies as a whole. The movie is full with gore , fun ,excellent fourth wall breaks (even one sixteen wall break) and the meta-humor was perfectly in mod with the today world. By far this movie open this year superhero movies with an explosion and silences all the haters who talk about superhero fatigue (go talk you fools about young adults movie fatigue).

Not funny,"Very disappointed with the film. One of the lousiest Marvel series production.The movie wasn't funny at all. A lot of violence in it.

"A rare gem, in an industry that is producing movies, with basically the same formula.","People can whine all they want about the mass production of superhero movies. For me it's like a childhood dream come true. As a kid I always dreamed of movies that are being made today and I will never grow tired.With the foul mouthed, vulgar, tortured, funny, unpredictable and semi sane anti-hero, that is Deadpool, maybe we perhaps will see a slight change in superhero movies. Just like Nolan's Batman trilogies did. Deadpool is the polar opposite of a superhero and not exactly what u'll expect. The movie is first and foremost a comedy and the funniest movie I've seen in a long time.If your not acquainted with Deadpool, he kills, chops off body parts, curses and annoys people for the fun of it. The movie is quite original and doesn't take itself serious. With a lot of movie references, good one- liners and offensive humor, u are officially warned. It is R rated for a good reason. The plot and story is pretty weak, but the movie itself is so thoroughly done and consistent that it doesn't really matter, since it is an origin movie. The sequels will probably be even better, now that the origin story is out of the way.Deadpool fans will not be disappointed, as it stays pretty true to the comics. I strongly urge people to watch this at the cinemas. I want more movies like these made and hopefully one day we'll see a decent ""Spawn"" movie be made. Then all my childhood dream ""heroes"" have been put to life. I would also love seeing more Anime be put to life, but hey, a man can dream, can't he?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
THE perfect comic book movie,"If you're a hardcore Deadpool fan you will want to watch this about 10 times, if you're a just a movie fan then you will absolutely love it anyway. It's the most accurate comic book movie to date! it has everything, comedy (so many laugh out loud moments) action sequences that are also cinematically amazing and there's a love story in there too, which doesn't fail to bring the emotions among the comedy and action in the film. This is seriously worth the watch in a cinema, with all the fourth wall breaks it makes it so much fun to have him look down at you and deliver a punchline or clean the camera, it gives you a different cinema experience which is definitely refreshing to all the other movies lately. Lastly, the post credit scene is also definitely worth waiting for with the nod to 'Ferris Buellers day off'",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Deadpool: The Merc finally got his mouth (and a movie),"I have never been very interested in superhero movies. Although there are some rare exceptions, these mostly come from DC (The Dark Knight or V for Vendetta, for example) and not from Marvel. Yet, I was highly anticipating the new film by Marvel Studios, starring the Merc with a mouth, Deadpool. Let me tell you why and how these expectations were satisfied.Deadpool tells the story of Wade Wilson, a mercenary with a very dark and sarcastic kind of humor. Wilson is diagnosed with terminal cancer in his liver, lungs, brain and prostate. He takes part in an experiment, to develop regenerative powers which, as a side effect leave him permanently disfigured. Then follows a typical revenge story to the people who have disfigured him. The story is not really the high point of this movie and the villain seem uninspired. They are just ""bad"" because they are and have no real motives.However, Deadpool's strength lies in his very special and meta humor. It already starts of perfectly in the opening credits where the writers are described as ""the real heroes here"" and the director as an ""overpaid tool"". This is the sarcasm and hilarity people want to see in Deadpool! There are many other funny moments, but sometimes audiences have to wait to long for the next laugh. There are two interwoven time lines in this film which eventually combine: The Wade Wilson pre Deadpool time line and the Deadpool time line. I personally found the Deadpool time line much more entertaining than the former.The acting is solid, but nothing special. The visual effects are very good, but also not the best we have ever seen. The soundtrack features, among others, a song from George Michael, for comedic purposes, but also actually good songs like Hit The Road Jack or X Gon' Give It To Ya.In the end, Deadpool is a great action-comedy with its flaws. It features hilarious humor, good effects and a diverse soundtrack, but also has a bit too clichéd plot, boring villains and sometimes a bit too much waiting time until the next good joke. 8/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Just a 7 dressed up as a 4,"this movie was a pleasant surprise in a world where Marvel super hero movies are impossible to avoid. the story was far from original, but the humor and the acknowledgment that is was a movie gave it nice feeling. Predictable as the script was they were able to keep my interest because of the personality they gave the hero. Like James Bond where Sean Connery insisted that the JB movies had a humour element and without that the JB franchise would have lasted two or maybe three movies. This movie does not take itself seriously at all. It is comic book and much better than it first appears. It will get no Oscar nominations (not even for special effects)and the violence is token rather than graphic. DP kills people but there is no blood, I would like to see a Luc Besson version!!!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Deadpool 2.0,"Deadpool is back after X-Men Origens: Wolverine, and hopefully we all forgot about that mess. This movie blew me away! Thankfully this film is here and it was awesome. Ryan Reynolds nailed the character of Wade Wilson so well and was hysterical throughout. The opening credits were so unexpected but hilarious. This movie recognizes its place in today's film industry and plays along with it throughout with so many references to modern culture. The thing I really liked about Deadpool was how original its film making ideas were and how it was just such a totally different comic book movie in general.The action is bloody but done in a perfect way to complement Deadpool's humor. About that humor, I was laughing my butt off almost throughout the film. Any scene with Deadpool and Colossus was hilarious. The revenge story and the love story present in the film were presented in a great way with both being extremely funny. It is also very, extremely vulgar, so be ready for it. The only legitimate problem I have with Deadpool was that some scenes are a bit too gratuitous when they honestly didn't have to be. Ed Skrein is fine as the villain but he definitely could have been more menacing.If you didn't like the movie, that's completely fine but be able to justify that with good reason. I've read a few reviews hating on Deadpool claiming the film is ""too violent"" or ""not appropriate for my kids."" Honestly, what were those people thinking when they went in? It was clearly labeled ""R"" and what did they expect from the movie after watching any of the trailers? Apparently they thought this is a perfect family superhero film just because it features a Marvel character. And then they call people who liked the movie stupid...Overall, this is a completely self-aware film that knows exactly what it is and what it needs to do to be a really fun action movie and it does it extremely well.

Terrible,"Not a professional blogger here. An honest opinion, from a HUGE comic book fan. This movie was flat out TERRIBLE!!!! A 5 year old, could have written a better script. I read comics quite frequently, and I understand deadpool was a smart alec, but the sexual graphic content was abit much. I don't care, if the movie was rated-R. The cursing, was a laugh or two at first, but it got a bit old. Then when it got to deadpool showing quick scenes of playing with himself, I just thought it went too far. REALLY! Come on! WTF!The overall script was boring, I just thought it dragged on and on, and the whole point to the story was deadpool wanted revenge on a guy, who gave him superpowers. But, the whole story line of giving deadpool super powers was not well thought out by the writers, directors or producers of this movie, as compared to wolverine series. It was dragged on way too long. In fact, the only bright spots in the movie was colossus and negasonic teenage warhead characters.This was an absolute disaster in fight scenes, I mean my goodness I know that deadpool is a violent comic book anti-hero or villain, All he did was kill, kill, kill. There was CGI effects, but it was nothing new!Consent foul language jokes just got old! Deadpool, YEP, he was always yapping. However, I think this movie took the foul language and sexual content to the extreme. All I can say is it should have been rated XXX for a porn.I don't understand how comic fans are raving about the movie, other than the fact, they just wanted to see any movie, good or bad on the movie screen about DEADPOOL.Quality or Quantity? I was surprised to see Disney or even STAN LEE produce a crappy movie like this. This is the worst out of all of the marvel movies. For those that say this is the best movie of all time, need to get out of their cave more often.... Shame on the people who created this movie.And there going to be a DEADPOOL 2 movie. DANG! What a waste of money and time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Ryan Reynolds is absolutely incredible as Deadpool, he just fits the character as if they were one. I went to the cinema without much of an expectation, and got out singing and laughing so hard. The soundtrack was amazing. The action scenes were incredible well done, with a lot of details. The comedy was just superb. The script there's no words to describe how good it was. Plus, this is the first time a character ever spoke to it's audience, at least in my ""universe"" of cinema experience, and it was just awesome.

Chappy Watched: Deadpool,"Firstly, congratulations to 20th Century Fox for finally making a decent Marvel movie!I know next to nothing about Deadpool, just the basics, but that didn't stop me from being very interested in seeing this. Major, major kudos to the advertising department for the amazing ad work leading up to the movie!This is the role Ryan Reynolds was supposed to play instead of that horrendous disaster that was Green Lantern.It's funny, it's crude, it's VERY bloody and very violent and I loved it! It also has an amazing soundtrack featuring Salt-N-Pepa.There were some CGI scenes that looked very rubbery, quality you'd expect out of something like Sharknado.The cast and characters were very so/so. Reynolds and Karan Soni (Dopinder) were the best with Leslie Uggams (Blind Al), Brianna Hildebrand (Negasonic Teenage Warhead) and Stefan Kapicic (Colossus) rounding out the better cast and characters. The villains (Ed Skrein as Ajax and Gina Carano as Angel Dust) were very mediocre, bordering on boring, and you have to wonder if it's due to the small roster of villains Fox have or they just wanted dull villains so the major focus goes to Deadpool.If I remember correctly, Daniel Cudmore, who played Colossus in the X-Men films was asked to play the character again in the film but he turned it down Why the hell would you do that? Colossus spoke and was in more of this movie than he was in all three X-Men films!!Another thing I LOVED about this film was the constant jabs at Fox, Marvel, Green Lantern, Reynolds himself, the skewed timeline and many, many more.An entertaining film that I will most definitely be seeing again, buying when it's released and eagerly awaiting the just announced sequel!CHAPPY THINKS watching a guy in a suit turning that other guy into a f*cking kebab has never been more awesome!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Grade movie followed with an A for AWESOME!!!! - MUST WATCH,"ABOUT TIME WE SEE AN ADULT COMIC MOVIE ! ! !There are too many people around that live under too many rocks and without getting too political on the matter, i would like to say; BOO-YEAH!About time we see people getting chopped, splattered, stabbed, shot at in single file (3 in line head shot) etc... & all the above. And all those one liners that deadpool brings out, hilarious...But all excitement aside i had to drop 2 points on the movie because it just didn't quite hit the mark for me. Don't get me wrong it had all i wanted in a comic movie, but i would of liked to see more of the other superheroes from X-Man and others. with that said i am hoping that the sequel (if there is going to be one) will have more story and other heroes & villains in it, lets hope fingers crossed XXXXOther then what i have mentioned before, i feel people are down voting for the simple reason its that they don't know who or what deadpool is or about. but for those people that do know of him and about him then its definitely a must watch.HILARIOUS - AWESOME - UNBELIEVABLE - FUNNY - AND MORE ! ! !About time we have an adult version of a comic, best yet. i wish all the other comic movies actually showed the brutality of the fighting scenes, just wish this movie had more of it.I am wondering though if they do bring other comic heroes in the mix will they tone down deadpool?

"Ryan Reynolds is great, fine film","It was good. I enjoyed it. But I can't help but feel disappointed. Sure, it's a lot raunchier than the usual Marvel adaptation films, more violent. But at the end of the day, it really just felt like yet again another Marvel film- not bad at all, but just fine. Aside from the wink-wink self- awareness (which is also trying too hard at times), it's really just following the same type of formula any ""superhero"" film follows. The longer the film goes on, the more predictable it gets and the duller it gets as well. I would say that I did like it, but a few hours after seeing it and I don't think it's anything memorable at all. For all of the talk about how ""shocking!"" it was and all of the publicity, it's really not all that shocking. At the end of the day, it's just like the typical Marvel fare, just too formulaic for its own good.Sounds like I hated it but not at all. I do feel like it could have been something truly, truly unique but what can you do. Ryan Reynolds is definitely the best thing about it though. Could have easily been too much, but he hits the notes perfectly.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Excellent,"This is the must see film of the year so far. It is witty, action packed, well acted and has the sexy Ryan Reynolds at the helm!The contrast of the journey made by wade Wilson into deadpool against that of deadpool and his vendetta against the evil baddie Francis is extremely well done! His sense of humour throughout the film together with the excellently shot action scenes make it a very enjoyable movie to watch. This film gets away with a lot being set against the sad back story of why wade Wilson chooses to embark along this journey in the first place.The only warning I say is that this film may be a little too violent and sexy for younger viewers who are used to the more traditional marvel films. Older viewers however will revel in this change to the normal marvel formula.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Funny and Action-packed; Perfect adaptation of Deadpool,"To start, I am a huge Deadpool fan based off a comic book standpoint. However, I think we were all a little mad with a certain situation that occurred in X-Men Origins Wolverine. However, Fox recreates Deadpool in a hilarious and smartly adapted way in this near- perfect movie. It basically ignores everything that went wrong with Origins, which is a really good thing. Ryan Reynolds is the perfect fit for the role and brings him justice after what was done to the character before. All the side characters in the movie are pretty great, too. The only thing that really bugged me was the story's villain, Ajax. Similarly compared to many other Marvel films, the villain here is pretty underdeveloped and it would have been a little better if the film would have explored his character a bit more.Overall, Deadpool is smart, fun, and a hilarious movie that anyone, including comic fans and non-comic-fans, can enjoy.Rating: A-",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Wade Wilson is a Mercenary who has superhuman abilities and unreal powers. But the unfaithful incident has led him to an entirely different lifestyle.,"Deadpool is a Marvel Comdey and Action movie produced by Tim Miller. This came to theaters on Febuary, 12 , 2016. The beginning jumps straight to the action. Deadpool is seen riding in a taxi to find this ""Francis"" person for some reason. After endless amounts of killing and bloodshed, you may wonder why this is happening. It all starts out with Wade Wilson. An unordinary person who works as a mercenary, killing people for money. He is often seen as a villain, doing things only for himself or for the fun of it. Soon he finds the love of his life, Vanessa. Things go downhill for Wade when he gets stuck with a horrible fate that changes his life forever.The emphasis on the visuals really brings another meaning to the movie. Especially when Deadpool breaks the fourth wall it really adds to his crazy and psychotic personality. Also, the music is really unique. It just adds to the randomness of the movie but also the intensity how certain scenes, such as when he's fighting an enemy. As for how the plot is edited It was different m. In the beginning it dosn't start out as how everything happened, but it puts audiences straight into the heat of the moment. The movie transitions back and forth from certain points in the film, and this was really well devised and put out.The theme of this movie is anything can be accomplished if you put hard work and determination into it. As we know Wade lost the love of his life, his charming looks, and just about everything his past. Despite all of these factors he still seeks out revenge that he hoped was a cure for his illness. Also, Colussus achieved his goal because even though he knew Deadpool was a hard headed person, Colussus was still persistent.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Fun but over-hyped,"I don't believe that any so called industry expert, film fan or comic book loving super nerd could've or would've predicted the absolutely mind boggling success of Deadpool over the last week.Taking the world by storm, shattering box-office records and garnering both critical and audience acclaim, the red suit wearing Marvel anti-hero with a motor mouth like no other's journey to the big screen has therefore been a bigger event than anyone dared to have dreamed.At the time of writing Deadpool holds an 84% approval rating on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes and an incredible 8.7 rating on IMDb, good for #44 on the famed Top 250 movies of all time and the same rating as esteemed colleagues like Goodfellas, The Empire Strikes Back and Seven Samurai and higher than classics such as Se7en, Saving Private Ryan and Raiders of the Lost Ark.When this is considered, it's hard to agree with the amount of praise heaped upon a film that whilst highly entertaining, isn't even close to being worthy of sitting alongside genuine cinematic masterclasses like the few films mentioned above, as when you take away the veneer of 4th wall breaking, swear word laden and brain splattering violence, Deadpool isn't as original or ground-breaking as some would've had us believe.Opening with a fantastic opening montage of carnage (those who've seen the now legendary test footage will recognise this scene well) and hilariously listed credits, Deadpool certainly hits the ground running and seemingly forgoes the origin story tropes of old only to fall back into a plot line that feels utterly familiar to anyone that's laid witness to countless other such stories of everyday citizens turned into anything but ordinary hero's or in this case a hell bent on vengeance killer.Getting into a groove that is elevated by Deadpool's preference for addressing the audience and cracking wise every chance he gets, Deadpool ticks off the boxes towards a fairly disappointing finale that ends proceedings in a pedestrian manner but at the end of the day people weren't queuing up at ticket booths for a genre shaking narrative, they were queuing up for Ryan Reynolds, OTT violence and more jokes centred around body parts and bodily functions than a full season of The Inbetweeners and on these ""important"" fronts Deadpool certainly delivers.Playing the role he was so obviously born to play (as really he gets to play himself), Ryan Reynolds has a blast as tough guy for hire turned the nigh indestructible Wade Wilson/Deadpool.It's always made clear to an audience when an actor is having the time of their life and that's what we get from Reynolds. Delivering lines like only he can and bringing a swagger to proceedings, Reynolds is the films MVP and while not everything that spews out of his mouth lays a comedic smack down, more often than not you can't help but laugh at how far Reynolds takes the character. First time feature film director Tim Miller also deserves credit for his handling of the films action scenes and with a budget that would barely cover costs of catering on an Avengers film, Miller gives Deadpool a unique feel when it comes to dispatching of the cookie cutter bad guys.Highly entertaining and responsible for giving Ryan Reynolds his true star making moment we've all been waiting for, Deadpool is a quick-fire burst of fresh air in a world of kid friendly superhero films that upon closer inspection isn't much more than a fun time out at the movies.One can only hope that the success of this film doesn't mean the originality of our now beloved potty mouthed mercenary turned anti-hero gets overused by money hungry studio executives, as too much exposure of this good time could quickly wear out its welcome as the novelty value wears off on viewers, that have at present time, put on their rose tinted glasses.3 ½ disgusting avocados out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Literally LOL,"It's been a long time I can remember I laugh so hard for a movie from the very beginning to the end. My friend even spoil coke to her chair cause laughing and have to enjoy wet chair for last 15 minutes. We even bring home the laugh by discuss the scene and dialogue. This movie could be called romantic too with very goofy kind way.And the best part of this movie I totally forgot how dirty, tragic, violence, and scary this movie is and enjoy it without feeling need to criticize it.But because this is an American movie with a lot sarcastic joke dialogue and popular culture reference, you might be don't get the joke if you aren't America and aren't familiar with those. Unlike me and my friends who practically feed ourselves with those thing, we just LOL non stop. There are few people in cinema just literally trunaroud their head to looked at us because we laughed so hard in a scene with faces ""what's so funny bout that???"".In the end of course don't bring your children, unless you don't speak English cause there are serious sensors on SUBTITLES in our country that's literally change the meaning for the whole dialogue.

Marvel Comics meets Quentin Tarantino,"I think the title says it all.I am one of those few guys who have never read any comics (I KNOW!!!). So like all other marvel comics movie I went in without knowing anything about what to expect.So if you are one of those guys then you are going to like what I have to say next.Did you like pulp Fiction? What about Inglorious Bastards? Kill Bill? Do you like blood sputtering everywhere? Do you like when you can see the inside of the brain of a person after a bullet has hit him? Do you like to watch beheading with a sword? If the answer is yes to the above it is very highly likely that you are gonna love this movie.Any movie from Marvel Comics has a certain standard. It will never be too bad. And there have been a lot of them in the last few years, and they needed to stand out. And the way this movie decided to stand out is by being gory,bloody and unchildly.Don't get me wrong - as we expect from ANY Marvel comics movie this is full of action, amazing special effects, great characters, decent storyline. But this also comes with a villanish hero. Its almost like the black spiderman. A superhero with an evil spirit inside of him.For me to review a movie is to think about what I will remember about it a year from now. And I will remember this: Marvel Comics got heavily inspired by Mr.Tarantino and created an evil spirited superhero who likes to take head off with a sword at any chance he gets.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Terrible,"This was the most cringing film seen; it had such promise with the humorous credits introduction and the funky cartoon type. It started well with a few wise cracks, but they sadly did not stop. It was one constant barrage of supposedly witty chat and streams of consciousness from the main character. The action was impressive, with an incredible amount of violence, blood and scenes of a sexual nature (very questionable rating which I would not recommend for below adult viewing. The problem with this film was the lack of connectivity or sense of empathy generated for the ""super hero"". It may have been the aim to have such a frustratingly grating protagonist, however it detracted from a potentially very good film. I have never felt so dissatisfied with the sense that I have wasted my time watching this ""sadly not Kickass"" film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
This is a new and different super hero movie!,"The opening credits are very funny! It's an unusual Marvel movie with swears and more! It is definitely different. It has intense blood.

I just saw it for the first time a few nights ago, and I sure did like it! And as I said, the opening credits are so funny! ""Starring God's perfect idiot, a hot chick."" Gosh! Get's me every time.

"Being such a film buff, one of the most well written films ever made.","One of the best films ever made, the writing combined with the delivery is what sells this film. I'm drunk and being such a film fanatic, I can even tell how good the writing is, really smart and straight to the point. The amount of fourth wall breaking (that everyone did expect for), genuine humour and gory action is what Deadpool is and therefore, what Ryan Reynolds is. It's Everything you need in a film to be honest. I have more favourite films than this to be completely honest like The Dark Knight and Whiplash, but to be honest, Deadpool hits me at a different level which is the reason why I review it!

"Not a great movie, but great fun.","Somewhat obviously Deadpool is not a great movie in the sense of having a lasting impact on the art of cinema, but it is a very well executed and entertaining film that combines action, comedy and romance very successfully. The strength of the film derives from it's well aimed ambition. It doesn't try to be anything it isn't, but does well everything it attempts. In no way does this film transcend it's genre, but it does quite adroitly play with with the genre's limits and conventions. On the whole the film is irreverent and crass, but there are some surprisingly well done sincere moments that give the proceedings some emotional resonance. While I liked the film very much, I'm probably just the kind of person for whom the film was made for. If, unlike me, one shies away from graphic violence, juvenile banter and crude language it might be hard to enjoy the other things that this film has to offer.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Having Fun with the Material,"Deadpool is said to be one of the most impossible material to put up on the big screen this soon. This hero is crass, the content is more vulgar and violent that may not be marketable for the mass. But the studio is smart enough to take risks, staying faithful with its nature and let things go wild. And as it goes, it's undeniably hilarious and really crazy fun. But for its ambitions of breaking new grounds for the superhero genre, Deadpool however falls short in that case. The tropes are kind of the same, except it's more self-aware and lurid. But this doesn't negate the joy the movie still provides.It begins with an opening credits that pretty much name calling however typically involves in major superhero films. The movie then cuts establishing what kind of a character Deadpool is; he's cold-blooded with a sense of humor. It also flashes back to his origin story and how he lost everything after the experiment that is supposed to cure his disease. The main plot is basically a simple revenge story, only filled with the otherworldly craziness and breaking the fourth wall jokes. And as the story go, it's not that fresh, but it's all about the personality of the hero must shine and it does deliver. He also keeps poking fun at the clichés of the superhero genre and the limitation in the production of the film. It's amusing all and all, and that's pretty much what we wanted to see here.Then again, it's nothing groundbreaking, but what we wanted to see here is just Deadpool playing around. Putting aside the playful stuff, the romantic subplot is actually kind of endearing. The villain is ought to seem like a stock one, but his petty weakness is what defined him. The action is pretty fun to watch, which mostly has headshots and decapitations. The CGI isn't always that impressive, but it doesn't keep the action from being watchable, as long as the velocity and clarity are good. The acting is a delight, Ryan Reynolds seems like he's having the time of his life playing this role and that shows in every scene he is in as Deadpool.Deadpool isn't quite that revolutionary, well maybe for the confidence of major studios making more R rated superheroes like this. As the plot goes, it's all familiar. Then again, the movie is all about the personality and it works delightfully. People may just brag that this is just Kick-Ass except with higher budget and a more known property and that can be true. The movie doesn't have too much of a novelty, but as it executes your expectations, Deadpool has that passion. And that alone may satisfy comic book fans, anyway.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Stopped me Dead,"Deadpool is an extremely violent film; picture an adult version of Tom and Jerry, if you will; only the characters are not a cat and a mouse. The film also dishes out a steady stream of obscene one-liners, many of which are over the top because it alludes to previous films of the director. But both these should not deter you from enjoying a well-constructed spoof of the superhero genre of films; unless you are queasy about intestine churning violence and/or prudish about offensive obscenities. The film makes its irreverent intention clear right in the beginning with a hilarious credit sequence that almost begs you not to take it seriously. Lest you begin to start taking the violence and vulgarity a bit too earnestly, the film breaks the fourth wall putting things in proper perspective for you.Amidst all this style, violence and vulgarity, the film also manages to tell a solid story; and it is nothing less than a love story. Just when our hero finally finds the love of his life, he is struck down with cancer. The torturously exotic cure that he seeks out leaves him horribly disfigured but endowed with superhero powers. Does he get back his girl? Does he get back at his tormentor?I am no fan of Superman, Spiderman, Batman or X-men, but I liked Deadpool. It stopped me dead for 100 odd minutes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I simply LOVED it!,"Wow! This movie really blew me up! I was not expecting this at all. Having a life and not being a nerd I had no clue about this character. I love him! Finally someone that is not a product of the Hollywood crappy world of Illuminati.This ""anti-hero"" is exactly what I would be if in a similar situation. I might actually be even more crazy. This guy is simply not accepting the weak-ways of the Batman, Superman and all the ""man"" series that follow the laws so that the criminal can still get out and make more lawyers work. (Hey, even losers need money, the fact they use a dishonest job to get it is only part of the horror but then again, they are stupid humans!)Deadpool, to me, is the REAL hero of Earth. When he gets a criminal, that criminal will not do evil again. With Batman and Superman he would be back out on the streets within 2 weeks, they use the ""law"", you know that thing for some losers to make a salary...There is plenty of action, laugh (in my case at least), and yes, violence. If you don't want violence watch the smurfs or Tinkerbell. The comments from Deadpool made me laugh the whole movie, I like his disrespect of the ""caped boy scouts"" which I agree with. (I loved the ""vulverine"" ones, it took me 5 minutes to stop laughing, it is so true! Big knives instead of fingers but cannot even scratch a villain! Wimp! Freddy Krueger was scarier and more efficient than Vulverine.)To the people that did not like the movie I can say; stick with your Twilight crap!

"Funny alright, but hyped way too much.","This was a strange experience watching this movie, because it is neither a purebred comedy, action flick or superhero movie. By creating a movie like Deadpool, filmmakers merge these three genres into one, for me at least undefinable genre. The movie is funny alright, no question about it. From the very first shot of the opening scene we are introduced to Deadpool who is a fast mouthing mercenary on a quest for personal vengeance.Mixed in between the countless snappy comebacks, hilarious one-liners or downright retarded comments, Deadpool's quest is a violent one, and still within the opening scene of the movie he shoots, stabs, crushes, decapitates, and in general just kills a bunch of other mercenaries. While on his quest, Deadpool is in an open dialogue with the audience, narrating his own origin story. Many times he refuses the idea of this being anything related to a superhero movie, but the attentive watcher will notice countless references to different parts of both the DC & Marvel universes. At some points during the movie, it feels like we are supposed the feel bad, or feel sorry for some of the movies protagonists, but when the same scene is presented with a goofy one-liner, the whole empathy thing is dropped to the ground. For a brief moment I loose complete track of what feelings the scene is supposed to create, and it's mostly because of these scenes I cannot rate Deadpool higher that I do.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
8.7? I think it's quite overrated,"I have to say at first I'm not a fan of Deadpool or Marvel comics. The character was not familiar to me at all before.I just came to watch the movie with a friend because we've seen posters everywhere, and it seems the movie is cool.Came out quite disappointed, didn't get their joke and indeed was slightly offended of too much F words (obviously their humors didn't come out successfully for international audiences, taken for example the night I went to watch, there's only a few times the whole cinema broke into laugh).

Lives up to the hype,"Deadpool has been much talk of the 2016 calendar year. Since the film became a huge success at the box office and was critically acclaimed through several critics throughout. Deadpool in spite, is a super-powered revenge-seeker who, like many superheroes, is quick with the wisecracks. However, what makes this film stand out is its obvious hard R-rating- they let Reynolds make a ton a unnecessary and profane jokes throughout, though it works and many of the gags and one- liners we hear are quite clever and makes for great entertainment. Ryan Reynolds really makes quite a turn as Deadpool- one of his passion projects he had for years, but is now finally coming to fruition. Besides, the lead character, the supporting characters bring energy to the film and are great in watching.The fourth wall breaking is part of the film's uniqueness, which is something we have rarely seen in superhero films. And in Deadpool, it really does add another great layer. The film isn't too long which works out great because it doesn't feel like it drags at anyone point (compared to the typical superhero film in today's age- which are usually always over two hours long. Deadpool has been compared to Kick-Ass and in some ways to Hancock (2008 film starring Will Smith), however, as an overall film- Deadpool is greater. As a second time around watching 02/25/17' this film gets better, the jokes are are clever and the fourth wall breaking is what makes Deadpool stand out. Looking forward to the sequel. Watching for a third time 11/28/20' opinions remain same.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Every Bit as Vile, Profane and Gratuitous as it Needed to Be","Just the kind of fresh blood this genre needed. Superhero films (and modern pop culture at large, really) have been ripe for satire for some time now, and Deadpool is a great vehicle for bringing that about without feeling disingenuous or trashing the original character along the way. The first hour is basically one long dose of fan service, sharp and egregious with both wit and weaponry. The seams show through in a lot of the CGI, but that just plays into the act and, in a way, adds to the film's clunky, DIY charm. Ryan Reynolds is really what makes the whole thing work, both on-screen and off, as he occupies the character with uncanny zeal and was instrumental in bringing the mercenary back from Xavier's junkyard. We stop short of the unhinged, deranged depths of disconnected insanity that typify Deadpool's comic book persona, and the closing act / happy ending feels force-fed, but that seems like a small price to pay. Otherwise, it's effective at becoming what it set out to be: a chaotic, gratuitous, shoot-from-the-hip misadventure that blows stuff up, decapitates bad guys and takes every opportunity to squeeze in a literal wink and nod at the viewing audience. I had a ball.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Who needs a Wolverine?,"Actually went to see the opening premiere at midnight this morning and it was awesome. The movie is first of all a treat for the fans but I think it will also appeal to the people that are getting tired of the superhero genre or dislike it. Ryan Reynolds shines as Deadpool and has really redeemed himself from his other superhero outing on screen. From the opening credits to the very end, the movie fires off jokes and oneliners at the rate of a machine gun. It is a very good homage to the comic book series and the breaking of the fourth wall only disrupted the flow of the movie once for me, then again it was in a way that was also done in the comics, so I cannot actually fault it. If you're worried about sex scenes or the violence, well, it is in there, but honestly most of the stuff you see in the trailer is in the first 20 minutes of the movie, after that it's a lot less. Kudos to Ryan Reynolds and Tim Miller for bringing this adaptation to the big screen, because I loved it (and I'm not even a fanboy for the the comics either).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Not quite as fun as it wants to be, but still fun","There was a lot of clever marketing around this film – marketing which not only got the sense of humor of the film, but used it really well to get to, and expand upon, the target audience. Like the film itself, it was all done with such irreverence and lack of respect for the genre, that I found it quite refreshing – particularly as superhero films continue to puff themselves into bigger and more serious epic franchises. Mostly, the film itself manages to deliver in the same vein, but it is not as consistent as I would have wanted – and I can understand those that hate it.For all its subversive humor, the plot of the film is a collection of familiar tropes – the kidnap, the revenge, the origin story etc. An added downside is that this flaw doesn't really matter, because the plot always feels like it is an afterthought that the writers added once they had all the jokes and scenes they wanted down on paper. These are pretty funny, and the irreverent tone helps it work, but if you are not in the right frame of mind then it will probably grate quite a lot. The action set-pieces are pretty enjoyable though, and it does play well as a faux-subversive entry in the genre.It is fun, rude, and gory; and it is enjoyable for it. It does have its weaknesses though, and in the end it is not as clever or different as it thinks it is.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Your inner 17 year old will love it,"My inner 17 year old self loved DEADPOOL. It had everything that any 17 year old boy would want in a movie - sex, violence and a smart-alec attitude, all wrapped up in an unapologetic package that reveled - and did not shy away from - these traits.At this point in the review, you are either saying ""f#*$ yeah! this movie is for me!"" or you have stopped reading, will never see this movie, so it doesn't really matter what I write.For the rest of you still reading, grab your raunchy comedy sense and head to the theaters to see DEADPOOL, you won't be sorry. Deadpool pokes fun at itself and the genre it represents right from the get- go. Get there early for the opening credits, they aren't quite like any opening credits you have seen before.First time director Tim Miller cut his teeth on animated short films (most notably, the Oscar nominated animated short, GOPHER BROKE) and it shows in this film. DEADPOOL plays like a 100 minute Road Runner cartoon with star Ryan Reynolds constant patter sounding more and more like the RoadRunner's ""Beep, Beep"" as the film progresses.Don't get me wrong, Reynolds does a nice job as the lead and brings humor and charm to the character, but after awhile it just didn't matter as it was just an excuse for fights, car chases, mayhem, violence and explosions - and I didn't mind one bit.There are some interesting characters in this film, most notably played by Morena Baccarin and T.J. MIller - two actors who I felt FINALLY got decent roles to play, but they, too, take a back seat to action and smart-assery in this film Even the great Leslie Uggams is brought in as an old, blind, smartass, and she acquits herself quite well.The smartest things the filmmakers did with this movie is that they did not back away from what they were trying to do - make a superhero movie that was a mash-up of THE AVENGERS and DIRTY GRANDPA, they didn't flinch from this mission, which is why it is successful. They accomplished what the set out to accomplish - make a Superhero movie that any teenage boy would love.7 (out of 10) stars - 10 out of 10, if you listen to my inner 17 year old - and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One of the most unique & best superhero movies of all time!,"Deadpool tells the story of ex-Special Forces operative turned mercenary, Wade Wilson(Ryan Reynolds). After Wade is diagnosed with a terminal illness, he volunteers to be a part of a rogue experiment. This experiment imbues Wade with accelerated healing abilities. However, this experiment has a few deadly side effects. Now, Wade goes after the people who wronged him under the moniker, Deadpool. Armed with an array of weapons & a twisted sense of humor, Deadpool goes about unleashing his unique brand of justice.Deadpool is a mind blowing film! The Merc With A Mouth, as Deadpool is fondly called, does everything in his power, to make sure that this movie is a truly interactive experience. Deadpool's antics puts the audience, right in the middle of the action on screen. This film truly shatters the fourth wall(for those of you who don't know, the fourth wall is the barrier between the viewers & the movie). Our superhero in the skin tight red & black suit, is well aware that he has an audience. Deadpool constantly looks right into the camera & begins with his hysterical narration & pop-culture references or, rants about his past. Deadpool's wisecracks & one-liners are some of the wittiest dialogs ever uttered by a superhero. This movie will have you laughing till your sides hurt. Deadpool is the funniest superhero to have ever graced the big screen(yes, he's even more hilarious than Iron Man & Spider-Man). His constant use of the f- word & the s-word makes him funnier & lets the audience know that, this guy is not just your average, generic superhero. Kids, this film is not for you! The action sequences are pulse pounding & gory, just like how the action in a Deadpool movie should be. The visual effects are brilliant & are only utilized, when absolutely necessary. The opening credits are one of the highlights of the movie. It is so freaking different! The performances are another highlight of the film. Ryan Reynolds is outstanding as Wade/Deadpool. Reynolds gives the performance of a lifetime & he clearly is a huge fan of the source material. Morena Baccarin is amazing as Vanessa. The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds & Morena Baccarin is electrifying. Ed Skrein is great as Ajax. T.J. Miller is spectacular as Weasel. Gina Carano is brilliant as Angel Dust. Stefan Kapicic is impressive as the voice of Colossus. Brianna Hildebrand is awesome as Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Leslie Uggams is good as Blind Al. Last but not the least, Karan Soni is hysterical as Dopinder. Director Tim Miller & the rest of the crew & cast, have definitely done right by Deadpool after his outrageous portrayal in X-Men Origins: Wolverine(2009). Deadpool is a must watch for fans of superhero movies & everyone thinking that superhero films should head in a different direction, once in a while.

"Just like Robert Downey Jr stands for Iron Man, Ryan Reynolds stands for Deadpool.","The debuting director Tim Mller manages to show great shots of action e give the right rhythm to the film. Using the Man of Steel way of telling origins stories, the movie balances between the super hero origin story and his mission to take down the villain which is very badly built. The tone of the film is broken only by its antagonists. They can't be taken seriously and don't represent a big threat. The jokes are very well placed and are a delight to the public, especially the ridiculous amount of bad language. Since is a movie for mature audiences, the sex and violent scenes don't hold back and seen to be enough to hold the movie. More than that wasn't necessary. Wade's friend credited as the ""Comic Relief"" is not that funny, Deadpool himself is above him in this matter. About the X- Men, Deadpool himself makes a joke about that the studio couldn't pay the other X-Men members, giving space to a CGI Colossus and the young mutant Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Both perform great action scenes and serve as a support for the Merc with a Mouth.

The greatest movie apology ever,"Deadpool, if you casually dip in and out of the comic genre, is a superhero. You may have heard the name somewhere on screen before, but probably forgotten. However, if you know your comics then you probably salivated at the prospect of seeing the 'merc with a mouth' going toe to toe with Wolverine in the X-man's 'origins' movie. Then you watched it and uttered words that no self-respecting spell checker should let me type.Basically, the makers of Wolverine: Origins completely messed up (putting it mildly) and the fans were not amused. Yes, Ryan Reynolds was actually a pretty good choice for the gobby anti-hero, but then they pretty much cellotaped his mouth shut and completely reinvented his character in the worst way possible. It actually makes a nice change to see a studio admit they totally got it wrong and do something about it (even if the decision is largely governed by money!).And that could have been that. However, luckily Mr Reynolds himself campaigned to bring a truer representation of the source material to the big screen. And, amazingly, it happened. And I'm so glad it did.Deadpool, is a superhero movie. You probably guessed that – you have the man in a mask who you pretty much know is going to go out there and beat the baddies and save the girl, yadder, yadder, yadder... However, what Deadpool also is, is a comedy. That being said – it's NOT a spoof. It's a tongue-in-cheek little number which has better action scenes than most action films and better comedy than most comedy films.I'm almost tempted to say that it's a film that anyone can enjoy. I can certainly see both men and women having a good time watching it. However, it definitely is a film for MEN and WOMEN. Whereas Marvel's current cinematic universe is kind of geared at kids (and us kids who never grew up) there is plenty in Deadpool that no parent will want to explain to their little darling. Again, don't let that fool you into thinking that it's all toilet humour – let's just call it 'adult' humour and leave it at that.Basically, Deadpool is great. Ryan Reynolds is mouthy, but never annoying and totally owns the role (as it should be when he plays the titular character). The supporting cast all do their bit, but it's Deadpool himself all the way. Please let this be the start of a franchise. It's probably a little too much to expect to see him crossing studio picket lines and ending up in the Marvel universe where he – truly – belongs, but we can always hope.

Funny,This is different from the other Marvel action movies. It's primarily a comedy and a grown up one at that with lots of dirty jokes. The action is funny and inventive. Lots of one liners some too quick to process or catch.This movie suits Ryan Reynolds because he is a better at comedy than more serious roles. Morena Baccarin is very beautiful in this movie and deserves to be on the big screen more not just television shows that not that many people watch. Gina Carano is suited to her role but she has become a very stocky.Prefer this to Guardians of the Galaxy. Worth one watch.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Infantile garbage,"Wow this movie really shows what Hollywood celebrity, a great marketing machine and money can achieve. This was the saddest excuse for a movie that I have had the misfortune of watching in a while.What a childish load of drivel. After all the hype it was a huge disappointment. There was nothing really funny about it - the best I can say is there were one or two mildly amusing moments and a couple of semi-decent action scenes but for the most part I found it more irritating than anything else. I can see what they were going for but it fell way short of the target.It amazes me that this would appeal to the masses at all. It is basically an indictment of and an insult to viewers intelligence",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Odd and different kind of hero, still a feel good and funny time of watching a movie!","True it isn't ""Batman"" or even ""Superman"" still this new hero that I just discovered and watched named ""Deadpool"" or AKA Wade Wilson is still an entertaining and fun character to cheer for and like! Actually based on a Marvel comics character the film rolls the dice and brings fun as seeing how one can be redeemed and fight evil while having feel good fun and joy. The backdrop is really simple a former special forces guy named Wade Wilson(Ryan Reynolds) is the victim of a bad experiment and in the meantime he's transformed into ""Deadpool"" and to go along with it he has obtained special powers and a very funny sense of humor while his alter ego has healing powers. Plus to spice things up on the side ""Deadpool"" has a very sexy and raw aggressive girlfriend named Vanessa(the attractive Morena Baccarin)who's a sexy lingerie wearing lady who's good in bed to bad she has to become a damsel in distress by being held by bad guys and even having her mouth taped, never fear ""Deadpool"" is to the rescue! Overall not the greatest film of a hero still it's fun, odd and different all bringing for a good watching experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One of the most unique films ever..,"Super, crazy, fun movie. It is just so unique. It made me laugh so much on the opening credits. I watched dozens of movies and I never laughed to a opening credit of a movie.Al tough the plot was cliché and predictable, the movie was so damn funny. A lot of great and smart jokes. That avocado joke made me laugh so hard. Not only the opening credits were funny but also after the ending credits we have a scene that was also funny. I was going to exit the cinema but the employee told me to stay and that it will be worth it. So I did and I laughed one more time and that scene convinced me that this movie is a comedy masterpiece. It is a definition of a comedy although it isn't a comedy genre.I watched it with my girlfriend on Valentines day and it was the best valentines day movie ever. Thank you deadpool for a great and fun time!I never expected that I would give a 10 to this kind of movie but Deadpool did really deserve it.And my last words: Best Marvel movie ever!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Merc With A Mouth Comes To Cinematic Life In Unrestrained, Unadulterated & Undiluted Form","Starring God's perfect idiot in the role he was born to play, jam-packed with R-rated naughtiness from beginning to end, and riding high on the strength of its raunchy humour, self-referential winks & pop culture references, Deadpool tells the story of the odd, unpredictable, loud-mouthed, sarcastic & delightfully deranged antihero in an unabashedly freewheeling manner, is continually refreshing on more levels than one, and is the funniest superhero flick to surface on the silver screen since Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. But I can't help but feel slightly dissatisfied, for this film could have been so much more than what it settles for in the final print.The story of Deadpool follows Wade Wilson, a former Special Forces operative turned mercenary whose plan of settling down and spending the rest of his life with the girl he loves goes outside the window when he learns that he has terminal cancer. After being approached by a mysterious recruiter who offers a cure to his diagnosis, he takes part in a human experimentation program that bestows him with accelerated healing capabilities but also leaves him severely disfigured. Managing to survive the ordeal, Wilson adopts the persona of a masked vigilante and, with his self- healing powers & twisted sense of humour, starts looking for the people who nearly destroyed his life.Directed by an overpaid tool in what is actually his directional debut, the film's wicked opening credits clearly indicate the kind of movie it aspires to be, and then follows it up with an ingeniously choreographed, gleefully violent & exuberantly witted first act that also turns out to be its self- defeating moment, for the film is never able to attain that same height again for the remainder of its runtime. Tim Miller's direction is quite impressive for a first feature but his inexperience also shows up when he allows the film to go into the overkill mode, and is clueless about when & where to draw the line. And although the story hurls one witty line after another, not all of them work out in the film's favour.The first act introduces the eponymous character to the audience in flamboyant style and effectively establishes his origins, eccentric wit & modus operandi but the rest of the narrative is simply a downhill journey. The writers stay faithful to the sardonic tone of its source material, the screenplay brims with playful, profane & parodic remarks, there is sufficient meat on the titular character's arc, and it follows an interesting trajectory as well but its middle & final acts fail to duplicate the effervescent zest of its opening segment and apart from Deadpool, there are no compelling characters in the movie. Many of its one-liners are hilarious & inventive, but a few of them become repetitive & wearisome after a while.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Ryan Reynolds, a hot chick, a British villain, the comic relief, the moody teen & a CGI character, with only Reynolds leaving a lasting impression. Reynolds' rendition of Wade Wilson both in & out of the suit makes it one of those perfect actor-character marriages, and it is actually difficult to imagine someone else playing this role with such remarkable finesse. Morena Baccarin & T.J. Miller play Wilson's girlfriend & best friend, respectively, and are runners-up in the acting department but their work is still no match to Reynold's input, for the latter carries the entire film on his own. Ed Skrein does well with what he's given, while the character of Colossus is plainly annoying.On an overall scale, Deadpool is an endlessly enjoyable, thoroughly entertaining & downright rambunctious roller-coaster ride that delivers on its promise of bringing the ""Merc with a Mouth"" to cinematic life in his unrestrained, unadulterated & undiluted form, makes blatant use of adult humour throughout its runtime, and even manages to subvert the superhero formula to an extent. But its attempt to defy the norm & follow an unorthodox route only happens on a superficial level, for beneath its surface lies the same predictable & formulaic narrative that we've seen many times before. Opening on an extremely promising note but losing its way in the middle, Deadpool works only because of Ryan Reynolds' swashbuckling, show-stealing & effortlessly charismatic performance and while it had the ingredients to separate itself from the pack, it isn't as unconventional as it appears to be.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Deadpool is perhaps the most shameless, unpretentious and blunt superhero I've seen off late :-)","So the movie starts and the crew members are introduced or rather described. I start laughing. And the rest is history........... I had to collect myself once the movie got over. Why did I have to collect myself once the movie got over ? Well, I was in splits and the mind was blown !!!!!!!!! You would find pieces of me everywhere in the theatre. I never wanted this movie to get over. The only bad thing about this movie is that it gets over ( and the fact that the protagonist is diagnosed with cancer). Otherwise, there is only heavenly awesomeness in every scene. Pristine heavenly awesomeness.Deadpool is perhaps the most shameless, unpretentious and blunt superhero I've seen off late. His jokes are audacious and alarmingly beautiful, his reflexes are the stuff of legends and if you are in his bad books you'll be scared of his jabs. He is a mutant you see. And his alter ego, Wade Wilson has an intense sex drive which is satisfied in possibly some of the raunchiest and innovative ways there could be. So when Mr. Wilson gets diagnosed with a terminal disease all hell breaks loose because he is kind of insecure that a zillion nice things would get compromised.I am not going to make this review unnecessarily long. All I can say is Ryan Reynolds has more than made up for his Green Lantern stint by playing Deadpool. His character is the sole reason why anyone should watch this movie.

"Just another ""Marvel"" movie","Before walking into the theater, I was told this movie was hilarious, deserving of an R rating, and one of the best marvel movies of all time. After watching it however, I can safely say that they got 2 of the 3 descriptions correct. The movie definitely deserves the R rating because of all of the nudity, most of the jokes hit their mark, to say it's the best marvel movie is a far cry from the truth.What made this an average movie boils down to two things, the first being the action, and the second being the CG. When you think of modern action movies, there are a lot of jump cuts of cars exploding, swords flying, guns shooting, and fists punching. Often it will happen so fast that you won't be able to quite make out what's happening half of the time, unfortunately, this has become par for the course. It wouldn't quite be a Deadpool movie without all of that action, it just seems really ""caned"" and boring where it should have been the opposite because of the character they were working with.The special effects and CG characters are incredibly disappointing and look as though they were made some time in the early 2000's. This becomes an even greater shame when you think back to the first ""Iron Man"" movie where the suit still looks really good, and that movie came out in 2008.At the end of the day, it was an OK watch, I wouldn't recommend seeing it in theaters even though it seems like it would be a perfect ""theater movie"". I also don't have the slightest drive to see this movie a second time which is becoming a reoccurring theme with most Marvel movies",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
This is exactly what deadpool needed to be,"As an avid fan of the character deadpool and a fan of Ryan Reynolds, I was completely blown away by this movie. This would literally be my favourite movie ever. I loved everyone's performance on this masterpiece, Ryan Reynolds is literally deadpool, so that is perfect, ed skrein shows a truly emotionless bad guy but in a very good way, moron baccarin plays a lovely, hilarious and bad-ass leading lady in this. T.J.Miller is perfect as weasel and him and Ryan have some of the most funniest moments in the movie, Brianna Hildebrand plays a likable but moody teen and Stefan Kapicic as colossus just seems like such a great guy and wants to do good and it is the polar opposite of deadpool and he has one of the best scenes with deadpool. Gina carano plays an easily angered super strength mutant as well as one can and it has one of the best Stan Lee cameos ever. The opening credits are perfection themselves, the structure of the movie works so well with this character. The humour is spot on probably 99.9999999% of the time and the action is absolutely amazing and brutal, which works perfect in the movie and doesn't feel to gratuitous and the script is amazing with much thanks to Paul wernick and Rhett Reese who did an amazing job and a great huge thank you to Tim miller who does a mind blowing job for a first time feature film director and I can't wait to see how his path turns out.only one problem with this, I now have to wait for the inevitable deadpool 2.to sum it up, BEST MOVIE EVER.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
7.5/10,"Entertaining as hell and explosively raunchy, Deadpool is a very welcome change of style in the genre, bringing to life a movie with many merits and ideas, yet, in my opinion, it is not the breath of fresh air everybody is saying.I'll just skip talking about Ryan Renolds since everybody out there has pretty much already said what there is to say, he is perfect for the role, born for it. What really surprised me about him even more is how much he was willing to make fun of himself. Actually I was surprised overall, by the whole movie, in how many times it went in certain places. I clearly remember saying aloud in the theater, amidst all the laughter, ""I can't believe they went there"". Some of the references, some of the irreverence, some of the hidden movie quotes, it was definitely the part I loved and that surprisingly, I wanted more of.The movie also shocked me in how much it had heart. They found a way to make a bat-sh*t-crazy love story actually work thanks to the pitch perfect use of comedy for storytelling. The whole setup of it was really strangely charming and absorbing. And it being so good in the first part actually made the second part kind of decline, because other than the final moment which is kind of fun, the love story really looses some steam and is sidelined for a big chunk. I really get why, but I just think that it was a mistake to divide the film into these big storytelling blocks than don't get to mix into each other. It made for some repeatedly poor stakes which made the film really loose the tight rhythm it could have had.The action scenes are a mixed bag here. On on side it is amazing to see some good old R-rated action that also manages to make out of the action some very big laughs and it does this a lot. On the other hand, it is really poorly put together, it is fast cutting and CGI enhanced a little too much. it isn't in no way ""Ales Cross"" level of crap, it is just a little underwhelming and could have been handled a lot better.The secondary characters also have their ups and downs. On one side they are all integrated into the movie very organically and play their role perfectly both in the story and in their relationship with Deadpool. But sometimes I saw a lot of character being given up to transform them into witty braggers. Yet I am a little exaggerating here, for the most part they all serve a good part of the film and even the villain who isn't the most three dimensional character, to say it cheaply, manages to still emerge. Colossus is a welcome addition to the film and he has multiple moments of his that are really fun.Overall I enjoyed the experience a lot and had a blast with the comedy in the film, still I would have liked all of the other elements to work just as perfectly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Ultraviolent. Bad language all the way. Average acting. 3 laughs. A slow-mo butchery.,"Seriously folks.I left this movie with a bad taste on my mouth. Cold blood killing, bad language, mediocre plot, actors acting like they don't give a s**t. And of course, high-definition, super slow motion violence. But it's violence, it's killing, for the fun of it, if such a thing does exist. I watched the latest Mad Max, also violent, but with a story gluing it, in a post-apocalyptic age. Deadpool is something made to make you feel insensible to violence and torture. There is indeed some little fun amongst the ultra violence, but it's just not worth it. The final scenes made me feel I was at the butchery. If you go, go alone. But tell me: what type of entertainment is this, that wants you to laugh at so much violence?

"Fun, but less funny than I expected","If it seems familiar, I used the same title for another Ryan Reynolds film: Waiting. It's kind of the same story: trying too hard to be witty and failing to be funny.I went to the movie with two girls, both oblivious to who the Deadpool was supposed to be or the filmographic history of both actor and character. Most of the jokes flew right over their heads! As for me, I expected those self-referential quips to be drowned in a sea of actual funny, which was somewhat lacking.Also, about its R-ratedness... not that much. It could have easily been PG-13 with some sex jokes added. For a character that was supposed to have been through hell and back, the psychological horror was severely missing and THAT is what R-rated means, not that poor prudish Americans have to hear about sex existing and seeing some random blood on the screen. Of course, that is probably because until a late phase of the movie's development, they didn't know it COULD be R-rated, so I will cut them some slack. I am excited though that it proved to studios that being a little ballsy doesn't mean people won't flock to see it. Expect all superheroes movies from now on to be a little edgy, after getting over the brooding phase.Bottom line: You know when a song is making fun of a specific genre, but objectively is part of said genre? So it Deadpool. It brings little new to the table beyond proving R can make money. Fun as it was, my favourite scene was Morena Baccarin in nude. I know, I should have started with that...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Non-linear work of art,Deadpool is a good take on the comic character of the mercenary Wade Wilson. It's nonlinear in that it ends where it starts and the plot is explained throughout the film in a flash back fashion. It has a similar dynamic to Fight Club in that way. It was a good mix of comedy and action. It makes use of dark and ironic humor. It definitely justifies some of its major hype. It compiles lots of story and action into one small film through narration. The action and effects are very well done and engaging. The narration is important because it really emphasizes the character of Deadpool and the way he thinks. The fourth wall breaks were also very accurate to the role of Deadpool. It was a very fun and entertaining movie.,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Not as good as hyped, but definitely one to watch","One of the very few modern era heroes (or anti-heroes) whose daily life is somewhat similar to a standard citizen compared to other marvel (or DC) heroes, Deadpool is a movie that should be seen by everyone who likes comic multi-verses. I think that in the overall sense, the movie slightly fails the over-hyped expectations of the internet community, but it is nonetheless a very important milestone in this sense. The narration style, fun moments and mature content makes this otherwise uninteresting film a 7 star one. Of course, the lead actor have a large part in this as well.

When Jackass meets Spiderman: Quite Amusing.,"""Deadpool"" is the same-old exchangeable Marvel happy-go-lightly formula wrapped into a very naughty, very black-humored, often cynical, violent and sexually loaded package that might appear fresh and shocking at first glance, but, once you've unpacked it, there is not much left than just a slight feeling that you've just seen nothing more than solely a bizarre persiflage of a good superhero-movie and not just that, you also discover that deep down, ""Deadpool"" is a rather naive story about true love, acceptance and the unwillingness to grow up.The main hero is such a chatterbox that he not only won't shut up even when a bullet pierces him another b***hole, he also speaks directly to us beyond the screen on a kind of meta level: this together with his ability to fully regenerate his body when injured really takes away something that every unforgettable movie should have which is, suspense.Sure, many lines are very funny and worthy to remember and some of the action scenes really kick a**; the somewhat kinky erotic dimension brought in by M. Baccarin, playing a role reminiscent of her iconic appearance in the series ""Firefly""; all this combined make the movie entertaining nonetheless, I just wished the plot itself would have been as provocative and crazy as the way it was presented to us.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

This movie was great!,"I liked this movie a lot because I was expecting it to be funny and be filled with action but it did all of that and then some. I was surprised at how well made this movie is, there are just so many great things about it.First off, the comedy is spectacular. The opening credits start off joking with you and it is amazing. After that you are constantly hit with jokes throughout the whole movie that make you laugh the whole time. Deadpool breaking the 4th wall in this movie was great as well. There were some lines in the movie that were pure genius and any fan of the other Marvel movies will enjoy them.Second, I knew this movie would have action in it but after hearing that this movie was actually very funny I began to more interested in the comedy of the movie. I did not know that this would be a great action film too. Also, there was a very good love story in the film as well. I was not expecting this either but this is where the film shines. It is able to balance all of these aspects at the same time. Sometimes it even mixes these emotions together. You could have a serious love scene with a joke put into it or an action scene that is funny at first and then becomes very serious.This movie is just great and I am glad that they made it rated R because it allowed for the character to not feel constrained and quiet. That being said, this is not a movie for children. No matter how much your kids want to see this movie, do not take them. Other than that, go see it, it was amazing and I know you want to.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One of the funniest movies I've seen,"Deadpool is one of the most funny, irreverent, and entertaining movies I've seen in a long time. It's easy to compare Deadpool with Ant-Man because of the humor, but Deadpool is much more adult, much more biting, more dirty, more sexual, and features poop and fart jokes. In other words, right up my alley. Deadpool is the fartier man's Dennis Miller.I don't even like Ryan Reynolds. Wait, now I do. And Weasel (T.J. Miller) gets to banter with Deadpool in a way that reminds me of the brutal barbs my high-school friends would throw at each other over lunch. The weakest points don't even really ruin the movie. For example, The Transporter Refueled dude plays a silly villain who's little more than a sadist without any interesting qualities. And the completely unnecessary appearances of Colossus and, ahem, Negasonic Teenage Warhead do nothing but set tables for movies that will perpetually issue until the end of the world as we know it.Much has been made of how violent Deadpool is. But it's really nothing compared to the gore of a Tarantino flick. And the breaking and breaking and breaking of the fourth and sixteenth walls is nowhere near as annoying as you would expect it to be. This violence and fourth- wall breaking is supposedly (sic) all true to the fanboys of the comics, so fine. And Deadpool even hints at his growing mental illness, something hopefully expanded upon in the future. It would also be nice to see Tony Stark's alcoholism become part of the movies.And you know what else? Deadpool clocks in at 108 minutes, not the overlong 2-plus hours you get so often these days, and no false endings or dilly-dallying around. The movie is tight and there is never any time to stop to wipe the blood off your face.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Everything you would want in a Deadpool movie,"Remember X-Men Origins:Wolverine(2009), well this movie tells you totally forget that and watch this instead, cause it tells the origins of Deadpool has it meant to be told.

Wade soon embarks on revenge with his newfound skills has Deadpool.I believe that fans of the character, will not be disappointed. Deadpool is supposed to be an incredible over the top cocky character. And if you have seen Blade: Trinity(2004), you know Ryan Reynolds can play that to a tease. Not only a marvel movie but a satire of a marvel movie, pokes fun at all those superhero cliques. Ryan Reynolds is clearly having fun here, so is the rest of the cast, it's not hard to imagine that was a lot of laughing during the filming, you clearly see it in the acting. The effects are incredible, and the action is over the top, but this is a Deadpool movie, expect nothing more or less. It has hard R violence, just by saying this is not a kid friendly marvel film.

Couldn't expect more from such a cool character, and its movie.Normally there are more than 5 superheroes in these kind of movies but Deadpool has pretty much only 5. That's a little bit expected because of the reason that it's centered just in Deadpool himself but as i said, being unique is the first thing that makes this movie special.And also, the fired shots to Disney and Marvel were really fun to watch.As far as the rating goes, the movie absolutely deserves 9 out of 10.

The real heroes here,"Greetings again from the darkness. Superhero movies have been dominating the box office for the better part of two decades, and most tend to lean towards moody and intense  though Iron-Man and The Avengers have certainly enjoyed adding searing one-liners to the mix. As for ratings, superheroes have steadfastly claimed PG-13 as the perfect blend of massive action, massive muscles and massive audiences. So it's a little surprising to find a movie about a relatively unknown superhero, that's the first feature from director Tim Miller (previously a visual effects guru), crashing through the R-rated barrier in no-holds-barred fashion. It's startling and refreshing to see a new take on what had become just a bit too familiar.This is a movie for which you will want to actually read the opening credits and stay for the post credit scene (a 2-parter). Additionally, you will want to make sure you keep not only little kids away (remember the hard R-rating), but also any grown-ups who are offended by harsh language (on the Tarantino scale), ultra-violence (on the Kill Bill scale) or any combination of sex, sex talk or sex jokes (all at an entirely new level). To label this movie as crass or profane is like calling Chewbacca somewhat fuzzy. And while it pushes the raunch-o-meter, it's also blazingly funny at times (especially for a cancer movie).The previously mentioned opening credits refer to the writers as ""the real heroes here"", and while the plot is pretty textbook superhero stuff, it's the barrage of one-liners and sight gags at which those writers so excel. They even make sure those unfamiliar with the Wade Wilson backstory understand that he is a former special forces operative turned mercenary for the average Joe's and Jane's. In no time, it's drilled into our heads that he is also a wiseacre, wisenheimer, wise-ass, wisecracker and any other adjective that means funny but not wise.Ryan Reynolds stars as Wade Wilson/Deadpool and leaves no doubt that he has finally found the role that fits him as well as his red suit. If you are convulsing as you flashback to Mr. Reynolds as Green Lantern (2011), take solace in the fact that this movie fires a couple of deadly shots at that oh-so-disappointing effort. His girlfriend Vanessa is played by Morena Baccarin (""Homeland""), and his best buddy/bartender is played by TJ Miller (""Silicon Valley""). Since Reynolds had a brief appearance as Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), there are numerous nods to that franchise, including two key roles here for Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The target of Deadpool's revenge comes in the form of Ed Skrein (The Transporter Refueled) as Ajax and Gina Carano as Angel Dust  accompanied by her theme song ""Angel of the Morning"" (unfortunately it's the Juice Newton version, and not the more powerful Merrillee Rush and the Turnabouts version). Lastly, it's pure joy to see Leslie Uggams cast in a spunky supporting role.Your kid may have a Captain America figurine on their bookshelf, but the R-rating is solidified in the first 10 minutes, and is relentlessly reinforced until the movie ends. We can only imagine how much fun those old enough to watch are going to have, and brace yourself for an onslaught of Deadpool comebacks over the next few weeks  only hopefully not in church, at the office, in front of grandma, etc",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"One of the Most Groundbreaking, Risky Superhero films in Years,","Deadpool is a fantastic movie with a really well developed plot and an outstanding comedic cast that are also very much able to be dramatic when it's necessary. It's a Marvel movie, connected with the X-Men series, but it is so very different, not just from superhero films, but from any other movie out there. It's funny, it has a surprising amount of heart, it's action packed and extremely violent, they certainly took advantage of the R rating. The best part about the movie is undeniably the main character and his ability to break the fourth wall, we have seen it before but never to a degree as extreme as this. He interacts with the audience, makes reference to the movies cast, the low budget, it's a terrific device that makes Deadpool such a fun, lovable character.The only problem I really had with the movie is that the character's origins are overdeveloped, it drags on for a long time, showing us how he met his love interest and how he became immortal, it was necessary but it did not need to be as detailed as it was.The cast is all around terrific, all entirely understanding of the blunt humour of this series. Ryan Reynolds shines in the lead role, of course, as he's been trying to get this movie off the ground for years, and his passion for the character is very evident. He is also joined by the likes of Morenna Baccarin, T.J. Miller, Stefan Kapicic and Ed Skrein, who all did a stellar job with their vital roles.Great fun from start to finish. Intense, violent and absolutely hilarious, Deadpool is easily of the best, certainly the funniest, superhero movies out there, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or comedy.After an evil organisation kidnaps his girlfriend, it's up to Wade Wilson, a man who has gained immortal powers and given the superhero persona of Deadpool, to save her.Best Performance: Ryan Reynolds",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The essence of Deadpool finally on the big screens,"The essence of Deadpool finally on the big screens! The story is as follows: ""ex-military and mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is diagnosed with terminal cancer, but is a possibility of cure in a sinister scientific experiment Recovered, with powers and an unusual sense of humor. he becomes Deadpool and seeks revenge on the man who destroyed his life. "". The synopsis already know that the film is very cliché and this is the greatest triumph.That's the premise of the journey of the more fuc*&¨% Marvel anti- hero. The film begins with the most spectacular opening credits that could be seen, leading the viewer to laugh even before you start. The great triumph of the film is Ryan Reynolds, incorporating Deadpool, he can bring to the public the essence of character with a perfect performance, dictating the pace throughout the film. Another performance that convinced was the Morena Baccarin, playing Vanessa (love the life of Wade Wilson, it seems even film of romance). Other performances were erased and without much attention. The direction of Tim Miller (directing his first feature) is perfect, with action scenes and slow motion very much well choreographed and directed. Taking some scenes where it was not a good use of the characters. The visual effects was one of the weaknesses of the film but also with a budget of ""only"" $ 58 million dollars may have been the best they could.So we can say that Ryan Reynolds finally managed to redeem himself after major failures adapted starring characters from comics: Green Lantern and Deadpool himself in X-Men: Origins Wolverine. After long 10 years of waiting, the dream of many fans was conducted, see the Mercenary Chatterbox playing the 'fuck' on the big screens of the better (or worse, it is rs criteria) possible in your own movie. Even with all the difficulties of making a film with such a low budget, we have a film worthy of Deadpool and a real ""treat"" for fans.I'm sorry by my English, guys.

A fun ride especially for guys,"There's a lot of rough wisecracking in this fast moving film. I saw this movie with my wife who liked it to my surprise though not as much as the young crowd we saw it with. They apparently knew a lot more about the story than we did.I'm not familiar with the comic but I recognize the style and it's pretty raucous and bawdy, the kind of thing I would have especially liked when I was younger. Ryan Reynolds is a great choice for the lead as he handles the fast talk as if he might have come up with the dialog himself.More of a surprise is Morena Baccarin who plays Deadpool's love interest, Vanessa. I've seen her elsewhere but didn't recognize she could be so lively a sex partner and love object. I thought she was miscast but I was wrong.Speaking of casting, like all good heroic tales, there has to be a good villain and Ed Skrein, someone I don't recognize, fits the bill nicely as Ajax a mad scientist of sorts.But for me the best part of all were the action scenes where Deadpool's moves are a thing of beauty. Assuming a real person executed them, that guy deserves to be recognized and honored.All in all a fun, entertaining time at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Don't let this dude be the main character,"After a awful F4, I think Stan Lee picked the right movie to appear in lol Deadpool is a character with a dirty mouth and a dark sense of humor. These interesting things were not exploited in X-Men Origins, but perhaps Fox focused more on the aspect of respecting the original comic. A simple Deadpool story but still shows the interesting character. The story is not too colorful or emotional, but the action scenes are still worth watching, Deadpool also brings laughter from the funny lines, although not everyone understands all the easter-eggs. The humor is put in as much as possible, combined with the way Deadpool monologues to the viewers, and even mentions the actors in real life... this is funny, but it makes the story not have much emotion, only humor. The production design is also not good. The story about mutant genes and Deadpool's origin is told quite boringly. But what I like is the music. Classic songs. Overall, if you're just looking for a few laughs, Deadpool will probably give it to you. But if you're looking for a more emotional story, this might be a disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Please stop the Violent Monkey Porn,"When a movie has to rip off ideas from other movies such as Ferris' Bueller's day Off, Guardians of the Galaxy, Hancock, Three Kings, Natural Born Killers and a few others, you know something is desperately wrong. But unfortunately, Deadpool doesn't even possess any of the originality or charm of the aforementioned flicks. And to think that those movies had any charm requires a stretch of imagination and personal taste. Did I mention that the Title also rips off Clint Eastwood's fifth Dirty Harry installment? What Deadpool fans see as original and innovative, I see an amalgum rip off. it borrows ideas from many movies and tries to mask itself under innovation.I'm not going to rehash this crazy plot, because it would just lend unearned value to this cinematic drekk, but Deadpool has uneven and inappropriate tonal problems that just jar against what movies have done before and what made them work well. This genre and the way they execute it doesn't work. Ultra Slow motion violence in the opening credits is a lousy way to start a movie. It looks retarded, ugly and doesn't prepare the viewer for any buildup or suspense. Instead, I was dreading ninety-eight minutes of offensive dialogue and nonstop cartoon violence which I predicted accurately.My biggest peeve about this cinematic waste of time is the Ryan Reynold's character. Watching a wisecracking, effeminate and sadistic superhero spewing out metaphors, pop-culture references and caustic remarks at a rapid fire rate is about as appealing as watching torture porn. I understand he is supposed to be an anti-hero you love to hate. But this ostensible intention misfires. I'm not sure exactly the class, distinction or persuasion of the category of people who gravitate to this type of art, but I know it doesn't include me. I can find solace, in this case, for being left out.Inserting humor with corny love songs for violent and repugnant scenes prompts me to wonder if the film maker knows what he's doing. Nothing seems appropriate here and leaves me shaking my head and rolling my eyes. Do not look for any subtlety, intriguing plot twists or thoughtful messages in this, because they don't exist here.I haven't paid much attention to Ryan Reynolds and I don't think he possesses enough leading man qualities to remain as such, despite how Hollywood is using him. I find him very plain and unappealing.Another curious and disappointing part of this work was Morena Baccarin. She looks too dignified, classy and sophisticted to partake in such juvenile smut. Hopefully, she can rise above this to where she can be regarded as a creditable actress in years to come and not some cheap eye candy for trashy films.I've read some blogs about how Hollywood has been churning out movies that distort the sensibilities of impressionable minds who don't know any better. Some even believe it's a conspiracy to destroy our youth. I can understand their concerns, but I try not to ponder such 'Doom and gloom' prophecy. I think humanity can survive if movies like Deadpool will cease and desist all future projects.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"A fun movie, even for those unfamiliar with the character","""Deadpool"" is a fun movie. I've never seen the comics or any of the other films and television programs with the character, so didn't know what to expect. I was admittedly a bit confused at first, as the movie didn't play out like a typical superhero movie. It took a while to adjust my expectations and I have no idea of who Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead are supposed to be, but assume they are new X-Men recruits. But my lack of familiarity with the franchise didn't seriously impair my enjoyment.The acting is good, particularly by Reynolds and Skrein. Special effects are excellent, although a bit heavy on wire work for my tastes. Fight choreography is excellent. The vehicular carnage was adequate to the task. Some interesting minor characters, including the taxi driver (Soni), the pizza guy (Dayne) and Colossus. A few of the snappy one-liners were not as effective as others, but most were amusing. Makeup effects and CGI were excellent. Over-reliance on jiggly cam shots for my tastes, although they disguised much of the jitter with slow camera movements. But the movement is noticeable in many shots and distracting in some.Ryan Reynolds definitely carried the show with a great combination of wit and physicality. I'm definitely looking forward to the next installment, reportedly due in 2017.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A gem,"The superhero movies certainly aren't on the top of my list of genres. Got to admit that I found Deadpool one of the most enjoyable superhero movies I've seen.The film really revolves around Ryan Reynolds as the lead character Deadpool(Wade). Reynolds is made for this role and it is very similar to the way that Robert Downey Jr plays Iron Man. The plot really plays second fiddle to the wise cracks of Deadpool and this gives the movie a feel of a comic. No doubt this will become a franchise, but something tells me it's this original that I will enjoy the most. Check it out and enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
a shocking take on the comic book genre,"Flip, foulmouthed, hilariously self-referential comic book adaptation is the long-awaited solo project for infamous Marvel character Wade Wilson, a savvy ex-mercenary making a living as a ""bad guy"" taking out ""worse guys"" in the big city. Having found some degree of stability in his violence-prone, unpredictable life, he receives some devastating news, until undergoing a rogue experiment that grants him accelerating healing and the potential to be a superhero--that is if he can keep his thirst for vengeance and various other antihero qualities in check. Fans who've grown tired of conventional origin stories will be surprised to find this lacks any of the usual qualities of a traditional comic book tale; amusingly demented, unapologetically profane, with gleefully over-the-top violence and sexual underpinnings to boot, this earns its 'R' rating with a big smile on its face. Reynolds' ebulliently vulgar approach perfectly suits the material, and helps overcome any of the predictable story elements. Subversive, loud, flashy, and literally in-your-face this certainly isn't for everyone, nor is it the most memorable film that the genre's produced, but it's a twisted guilty pleasure for sure. **½",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Adult type Superhero film that kicksass,"Here's an inventively original super hero comedy, unfortunately not one for kiddies. I expected laughs all through, but was sold short on that, where instead, they come in durations, and ones of some pretty hysterical s..t, but too, it's very smart humor, thanks to lines from a screenwriter, you have to envy, because they're that good. From the opening credits, of originality, you have to admire, played against an 80's track, you do not expect, and the opening scene, you've got one loud, clever superhero flick, with some gruesome moments, mind you, as revengeful Reynolds, now donning a bland Spiderman looking costume, is after the badarse Skein ( who makes a great English villain, topping Reynold's performance easily) who horribly disfigured his beautiful baby face, where he's wears the congressional medal of ugly, where that big guy from Fantastic Four doesn't look that bad. That's sheer motive, to go after and kill his guy. The movie starts, half point of story, which is clever, where we rewind, to find out Reynold's life, prefore, to his little misfortune, where he was a kind of secret vigilante, working for an secret agency. He has a hot girlfriend, but his health's not that good. I was pretty happy from what Deadpool delivered, better on a second watch. It was just the laugh factor, that let me down. It's a smartly original film, where Reynolds, who like Charlie Sheen, has great comic timing, and I did like the way he played it, despite not being Oscar attraction. The girlfriend, but it's Skein you'll remember. The young superhero girl, who with Reynold's old protégé, a big monstrous Fantastic 4 figure, helps him dispose of this evil, looks like that creepy hate driven girl in The Crush. There's a nice V.O after note that ends this ambitious piece of film making too. A must see, again, not for the kiddies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Strikes the exact right tone,"Former Special Forces operative Wade Wilson(Reynolds, hilarious) is lending his services to those who need it for small fries – but don't call him a hero. When he learns he has cancer pretty much everywhere, he goes along with an experiment that may bring out his mutant superpowers, if he has any. It leaves him able to heal any injury, while also rather unattractive. He fears his romantic partner Vanessa(Baccarin, sexy, charming) won't want him anymore, and tries to find Ajax(Skrein, easy to hate...in the right way), who was in charge, and who claims he can reverse the effects.A straightforward revenge story, complete with a love interest, leaves this just mainstream enough to satisfy the studio heads, and lets writers Reese and Wernick, as they did with Zombieland, play around with every single other genre trope, subverting our expectations and delivering an enjoyable ride to those just coming in as well as those all too familiar with the comic adaptation. The cool, swift action isn't big enough to compete with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, it's the first movie in the X-Men franchise to refuse to add several detailed abilities(leaving it rather bland, with both sides just being ""incredibly strong""), and it is very much an origin flick. While there's no teleportation, we do get dual Desert Eagles and Katanas, and there's acrobatics all over the place. And this does justice to the non-stop barrage of pop culture references and irreverence of the Merc with the Mouth. The fourth wall breaks are kept sparse enough to have the most impact.There is a lot of strong language, a moderate amount of brutal bloody disturbing violence, and a little nudity in this. I recommend this to anyone who has a dark, twisted sense of humor. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Not a family movie like the other Marvel Movies - Very disappointed.,"I have been a great fan of all the X-Men and other Marvel movies. Mostly because they are movies that I could take my kids to and enjoy a good story with action and super heroes. I didn't bother to read the reviews or what the 'R' rating was for before I stepped into the theater which was a huge mistake. I assumed (a$$) that the 'R' was for the action and maybe a few off-colored words... no, no, no!! Sex, Nudity and every other word was the 'F' bomb! We finished the movie because it cost me $50 but it will never be watched again in my house! Even the story line wasn't that great, it was basically an hour and a half of cussing and vulgarity that a mom doesn't want to sit and watch with her sixteen year old son and daughter. I have learned my lesson though, I will never take my kids to another Marvel movie without checking what the rating is there for which makes me sad. :(",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Funniest Movie I've Ever Seen In My Life,"Deadpool is not only the funniest movie I've ever seen; it's also the best. The jokes are hilarious.

And on top of that, the action was fantastic. The cinematic shots were nothing short of a masterpiece, and the dramatic stills and narration only served to maximize the experience. The character of Deadpool was also very well written. He was funny; whilst also remaining complex and emotional.

A new kind of super-hero about to spawn a new franchise,"If you like your super-heroes straight and serious as opposed to camp, jokey and totally foul-mouthed; if you prefer a narrative that is linear and third person rather than one with lots of flash-backs and a first-person dialogue which regularly breaks the fourth wall; if you like violence to be quick and clean rather than brutal and disfiguring; then I guess ""Deadpool"" is not for you.Think more ""Kick-Ass"" than ""X-Men"". If, on the other hand you're up for something rather different - a central character with special regenerative powers who is out for revenge for himself rather than justice for society and whose constant witticisms are as often about sex as cultural allusions, then you will find this movie a refreshing change from the usual super-hero fare.Five years ago, Ryan Reynolds starred as the Green Lantern in a disappointing movie, but here he has created such an original and fun character than we might well have a new franchise. Certainly there would be scope for more bridges to the X-Men franchise, but for now we have only two new X-Men in the varied shapes of metallic giant Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and young Sian O'Connor look-alike Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand).Also it would be good to have a more original villain than yet another Londoner (Ed Skrein) and to see more of Wade Wilson/Deadpool's girlfriend Brazilian ""Homeland""-star Morena Baccarin.By the way, be sure to stay till the end of the credits ...",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A very ""unique"" opening sequence, followed by some mind-blowing action sequence. Enough cannot be said about the action and choreography: amazing action, coupled with punchy one-lines and super cool slow-mo scenes.The humor in the movie is dry and sarcastic and really well written (some may not agree). The dry wit adds a very realistic and natural dimension to the character and makes you connect with him. The one- liners and wise-cracks is almost continuous when Mr. Dead Pool is around, and when he is not on, we wish him back just so that we can hear him mouth-off!Negasonic and Colossus have limited role in the movie (except towards the last big action sequence).

Deadpool 2 just plain old doesn't GAF,"One thing that is important to remember is that this is an R rated comedy first and an R rated action movie second with super ""hero"" syrup all over and inside its crevices.If you weren't a fan of the first one, well I guess it depends why but DP2 probably won't tickle your jimmies. There is all the swearing, brutal violence, blood, dismemberment, jokes, irreverence and meta-references that you would expect. Every scene with a serious tone is completely cut out by jokes, but this is still a bit more of a movie with plot and characters and motivation and all that sort of jazz. Definitely tried a little harder to make more of a narrative than ""guy kills dude to save girlfriend"".The stakes are really only relevant to those on-screen. Sure, there might be some larger implications if you really think about it, but they're never stated. The implications that are stated are small time, but that makes the stakes personal and better for a plot involving a bunch of selfish characters.Its also nice to have a movie that doesn't take itself seriously in a time where most blockbusters with ridiculous premises are also trying to be like ""BUT THIS IS REAL LIFE!""Its more of what was successful.

Deadpool is played by Ryan Reynolds who did a fantastic job at his role. He was able to represent the hero we know from the comics, just as witty, just as different. I think the humour in this film would defiantly budge up the age group to...lets say...50? A lot of the jokes personally reminded me of inappropriate dad humour. I have already heard that there is likely to be a Deadpool 2, as if, its only been out 2 months.

Such a silly movie but I love it,"How can I describe Deadpool? First of all, Deadpool is not the kind of guy you would want introduced to your respectable parents. He is rough, he is vulgar, he has no ethic whatsoever and he's superficial. At the end of the date, you would all end in jail alongside him while he's eating a pizza.But this anti-hero side makes him so attaching and so charming in the same time. He's so refreshing compared to his X-Men buddies driven by justice and compassion while he clearly doesn't give a damn at all. This clash between two philosophies is a great source for hilarious scenes.The huge dose of humor is by the way welcomed because Deadpool is really violent as well. Some scenes despite being funny are also quite gory. A lot of people die in the movie most of them in a very violent way. But the lightness which comes from Deadpool makes them more enjoyable to watch.But most of all, the movie is allowing us to see the huge comical talent of Ryan Reynolds. He bears the movie on his shoulders. I can feel he has so much fun impersonating Deadpool and he shared his fun with his partners.

Yet the director does it in a very unique way. The moving camera in a still frame shot of a yet to happen action scene is both hilarious and brilliant. Lots of little Easter eggs as the scene unfolds.This movie was the epitome of wit and slap stick. I literally fell out of my chair LMFOing all over the place. Reynolds delivers his jokes so effortlessly and so fast you really don't catch them all until about the 3rd watch. Definitely adding this one to my favorite movie collection.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
THE Absolute Best of the Marvel Bunch,"A highly enjoyable balls to the wall comedy action flick that knows exactly what it is and never takes itself too seriously. For me Marvel comics has created many of the best and most watchable blockbusters on the market right now and this does not disappoint.Extremely sarcastic and willing to poke fun at other Marvel characters and even the actors who play them which makes for a superb look at deadpool and his anti-hero mentality. Ryan Reynolds is absolutely perfect for this role and simply no other actor could play this part with such ease and confidence the way Ryan does.Jokes land and are laugh out loud, the action sequences are excellently done with comedy even thrown in and the story keeps you thoroughly entertained throughout.Overall a completely unique and refreshing look at the 'hero' genre and a mixture of original comedy, action and good old bad ass fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Not the typical superhero film,"After watching superhero movies like Ant-man and Ant-Man and Wasp recently, along with Iron Man, X-Man, and others in the past, this movie stands apart. You may ask how. Well for one, the protagonist Deadpool is the narrator and he refuses to be classified as a superhero, seeing himself as more of a bad guy fighting other bad guys. So in that way, perhaps the film does subvert the superhero genre. Perhaps its funny as well. Still, like every superhero movie, it connects to the others (apparently more so in Deadpool 2), creating a Marvel Universe web, bringing more money in for Hollyweird producers.This movie does tie into the X-Man movies, but it also has its own style. I think it effectively uses the tactic of talking to the camera, which doesn't always work in these movies, but it does work here. The playful nature of this movie, which is still relatively violent, should make it no surprise that this film did relatively well at the box office. You could also say that this film is part of an anti-hero superhero movie brand and that is probably accurate as well, but it does not pull away from the nature of this movie as a whole.All in all, this is a fun movie. I don't think I would watch it again, but it was a nice break from other movies, especially typical superhero movies, nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

The Vidiot Reviews....,"DeadpoolWhen the random shooter jobs are all taken, mercenary work is the next best option for ex-military.However, the garrulous gunman in this action-comedy proves you can do both.Mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) undergoes cancer treatment for his girlfriend (Morena Baccarin). But instead of a cure, the formula activates his mutant healing ability and leaves him disfigured.With help from some X-Men (Brianna Hildebrand, Stefan Kapičić) he adopts a mask, a moniker and a light-hearted outlook on his off kilter quest for revenge on the perpetrator (Ed Skrein).From Reynolds on-point portrayal, to the cartoony violence and the fourth-wall narrative, this reappearance of Marvel's merc with a mouth after his ill-fated debut in an earlier X-film is a ribald and refreshing reboot that is as faithful to the self-aware smart-ass as can be.Furthermore, it shows burn victims a jazzy costume is all they need to reacclimatize to society.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Not very funny, or exciting, or interesting","I was excited to see this film given the hype over how funny it was, irreverent to super hero movies, and interestingly adult (love story) it was. It was none of these. The characters were annoying, the plot was not suspenseful, and the dialog was mostly child like potty and sex humor. The only love story was between a lustful superhero and a stripper. They only reason they loved each other was because no one else would or could since they are despicable. Some of the scenes were so disrespecting to human life I had to close my eyes and turn my head to stop from getting sick. I noticed that some people left the movie. Perhaps this movie was not made for people like me. What I found most disappointing and confusing was how disconnected the story was. The super hero and the villains were so powerful at some times and then at other times they were killed with one measly bullet or punch. I will give it some credit for the graphics, sound effects, costumes, and animation. I kept wanting to like it but in the end I left unsatisfied.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Perpetual death-drive's the allure,"I guess the reason it's so easy to divinate Deadpool is that his self- destruction, the normal humans' death-drive alike (as explained by psychoanalysis) actually drives him toward greatness, immortality even - this is what we're often driven to believe in our lives as well (besides immortality, guys, I hope no one is so naive).Only when reality kicks in, we tend to stop, regain control, get back to our terms, realize that these self-destructive processes we put ourselves through as coping mechanisms might actually lead to perishing of our existence. On the most basic level, who doesn't like to get trashed of alcohol on a Saturday night for that matter?This is where Deadpools' humor kicks in as another tool of success for this impeccable story, to help us cope with the inabilities that we face and fail to overcome, especially psychologically. Well not exactly the same inabilities, but hey, Deadpool might be immortal now but his face's ugly as life that he now has to live forever, so we ain't the only ones with problems.Very captivating film without this pretentious effort of other superhero movies, but still full of glittery artifice and shinny CGI.

Super Hilarious,"""Deadpool"" (2016) is a hilarious super hero film. The story is a about a witty mercenary, Wade Wilson who turns into Deadpool played exquisitely by Ryan Reynolds, after his search for a cancer cure goes horribly wrong. The story has drama, romance, and some serious adult comedy.The music in this film is outstanding. Every song serves a purpose whether to emphasize the scene or add a touch of funny to an otherwise serious action scene. The music for comedy, though very enjoyable, is outdone by the comedic performance of Ryan Reynolds. His dry, straight faced humor is perfect and had me gasping for air through my laughter.

Off Balanced Dark Superhero Comedy,"29 September 2016. I'm reminded of Wil Smith in Hancock (2008) which was more of a superhero crime drama than a superhero dark comedy action as Deadpool. Nevertheless, perhaps its the contemporary times of change and loosening of societal morals that the gutter talk of sex and swearing like young boys and late night comics within a superhero movie was inevitable. While the dark humor is creative and at times refreshing, it really seems more like a stand up comic night with a lot of R-rated one-liners. Even Deadpool noted the absence of a lot of superheroes in this movie. The fusion of comedy, action, and then a severe transitions to romantic drama, along with the constant cynicism much better presented in Hancock, made for a jarring experience with a movie without a consistent tone. Along with a lot of Kill Bill death-dealing and death-defying action, this movie seems more like a testosterone action entertainment thriller for boys rather than anything really seriously award winning. The one redeeming element of the movie was Ryan Reynold's delicate and remarkable performance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"badass , smartass , greatass.","Finally, an adult superhero movie totally worthy of it's hard R rating! Ryan Reynolds is pitch perfect as the titular antihero with non-stop wise cracks and a potty mouth. He more than carries the film which is very, very funny. Tim Millers direction and the action sequences are equally hyper violent and thrilling as well as the supporting cast, which is solid too. But again, this is Reynolds movie all the way and he more than makes up for the train wreck that was Green Lantern back in 2011. So yeah, Deadpool is pretty great. It's not perfect, but this unconventional superhero love story works on almost every level, and if you're in the mood for a good time, I'd suggest giving Deadpool a try.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A gamechanger for superheroes movies made for adult audiences.,"When was the last time you enjoyed watching an R rated superhero movie? If you're thinking a movie like the Blade series, you're right. Now here comes Deadpool, a movie based on a character in the X-Men film franchise that made its debut in the horrible X-Men Origins: Wolverine (played by Ryan Reynolds) and now has his own franchise movie. Kids wouldn't like this movie since it has crude jokes, excessive violence, some nudity, and lots of bad language. For adults, they will love this movie. It feels more like a comedy than an action movie, and it shows. I missed it in the theaters when it was a big hit and finally saw it on digital HD as well as numerous times on HBO and bluray. This movie saved Ryan Reynolds' career after his dismal performance in Green Lantern. This movie is to Marvel/Fox what Wonder Woman is to the DCEU: a huge improvement.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Action packed, brilliant and hilarious","Deadpool is directed by first time director Tim Miller and stars Ryan Reynolds, Ed Skrein, Morena Baccarin and Stefan Kapicic, and tells the story of a former Special Forces operative turned mercenary, who is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers. Therefore adopting the alter ego ""Deadpool"".It's unbelievable to say, but Fox did it. They made the Deadpool movie I could only dream of. Everything was perfect to the last detail. From the opening credits all the way to the ending. I was surprised to see that they took extra effort in putting in all these small, but hilarious details. It really is a relief that I can say that Deadpool succeeded. I just had so much fun watching this film and the audience in my theater loved it too. Even the six year old in my theater loved it! He just kept on laughing and cheering. It was amazing!Ryan Reynolds is amazing as Deadpool. The guy nailed it. From the jokes, all the way to the famous Deadpool characteristics. It was spot on. And the banter between him and Colossus was just perfect! I'm glad to hear that Reynolds is returning to play Deadpool in future installments. As far as I'm concerned, he wants to play Deadpool forever.The directing by Tim Miller was phenomenal! Very impressive for a first time director. He inserted all the fourth wall breaks in brilliant ways. The action scenes were filmed stunningly and they were breath taking. I'm eager to see what he does next. Rather it be another Deadpool film or something complete different.The biggest praise I can give this movie is that I wanted it to keep on going. I just didn't want it to stop!

Unique Adult Fun,"I did not see this until after I saw and loved Wolverine and Deadpool. That being the case it filled in a lot of issues but was also a slower start than expected because the new one starts off so deeply into the story. This is unique, adult, violent genre bending fund. I have never been a fan of Ryan Reynolds, and would never go out of my way to see his movies-especially Green Lantern. However, this is the part he was born to play. He is terrific. The story is good. The effects are good. The violence and fight choreography are great. The humor is top notch and non stop. The characters and acting is perfect.

"Deadpool, not great but highly enjoyable","Deadpool is a slightly different take on the superhero genre. Is he a good guy? Perhaps questionable. He is self aware he's in a movie but no-one else is. Something I simply didn't understand the reasoning behind. It took me by surprise, it was something different but I did think it made the movie unique. The storyline is simple but it does a nice job telling you the origin of story, by switching between the current action and he moment he becomes Deadpool. I find most origin stories are often very long winded and you start to lose interest, this simply isn't the case.Ryan Reynolds is perfect for this role. Which to me comes as a big surprise after seeing his last effort as Deadpool in (X-men Origins Wolverine) not to mention his performance in (Green Lantern) which I think we can all agree, were awful. So maybe superhero movies are not in his repertoire, so needless to say I didn't have high expectations . However you can't fault his performance. I think he did a great job and just don't think this movie would have been as likable without him.This superhero/dark comedy isn't really for children. It's not a great movie and perhaps slightly overkill with the try-hard jokes. However the movie makes fun of itself throughout and there is something very likable about this film.

"To be a superhero movie, finally a good one","A very good movie. I was really tired of bad superheroes, bad plot, ridiculous scenes which exaggerate the comedy in an awful way (the new Spiderman saga, Thor 2, Iron Man 3, Avengers, the last movie of the Fantastic 4 - no matter if Kate Mara is Sue, etc.). But this time, was a big surprise for me.Fortunately for us, this time a suitable version of a ""relatively good"" Deadpool (or at least no a really deranged one) was chosen for the big screen, and creates a credible superhero, with very human and understandable motivations. And most important, this is a superhero which is not an idiot who thinks that bad guys deserve a second chance. That is what you really like in a movie like this.

There is no story line, no twist, no surprise, no thinking, nothing. And the casting is lousy as well, characters are dull and they try too hard to be funny.Yes, speaking of funny, I don't get why people think this movie is funny.

The Master of the Mercenaries,"This is my review for Deadpool (spoiler free).If you don't know who Deadpool is, he is a wisecracking mercenary named Wade Wilson who is very aware he is in a comic book. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for the role of the merc with a mouth, under the direction of newbie director Tim Miller this is the film that Deadpool have been waiting for.Cast: Ryan Reynolds, Ed Skrein, Morena Baccarin and T.J Miller.Plot: A former Special Forces operative turned mercenary is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopting the alter ego Deadpool. It's an origin story and a very good one.This hilarious action comedy is filled with funny wisecracking jokes that will leave you crying with laughter probably every five minutes, among the hilarity there are ultra-violent action scenes with wisecracking jokes.Let me go through some points of why I think this is the Marvel film to see this year:Violent action scenes: The strong bloody violence makes this the perfect Deadpool film for any Marvel fan. What else can I say about that?Fourth-wall breaking: The joy doesn't stop there with the action and sex references there is also amazing fourth-wall breaking that is just relentless.The film certainly delivers even from it's meager $50 million production budget certainly less than other Marvel movies. This is Ryan Reynolds at his best he is perfect for the role as the Canadian anti-hero, it's certainly a lot better than 2011's Green Lantern starring the same actor.Tim Miller made this film well and will probably go down in history as one of the best Marvel films all time. This action packed comedy is rude, funny and full of violence in my opinion this is by far the best film of 2016 so far, and I recommend it to everyone.Seriously you will endlessly be laughing with joy. 10/10 is not enough of a rating for this film.

There has never been a movie like this to date,That is a very difficult thing to say these days with everyone being a copycat. Originality alone should demand at least 8 stars.Incredible movie...one of the funniest movies ever made. If you are a Deadpool comic fan like me you will be very happy with this movie. As a comics fan you always wonder if they can get it right. This was the character Ryan Reynolds was born to play. Don't be surprised to see this movie exceed box office expectations. Every person in the theater was laughing almost the entire length of the movie.Although this movie is inherently an action comedy it also has it's appropriate moments of being serious....just the right amount to get you invested in the characters.I am guessing anyone not giving this 10 stars is either too old or too uptight with their prudish sense of humor. Make no mistake this movie has some of the most crude humor imaginable and if you're a prude goody two shoes there is plenty of rude crude humor to make you turn away.Even though your younger teenagers will want to see this movie and LOVE it---it is NOT appropriate.

R-rated super hero movie. Oh yes.,"I'm glad this movie was made. And who can we thank for this?. Ryan Reynolds, the handsome awesome-dude. Reynolds kept pushing for this film for like a decade before it was finally green-lit. The studio did not believe in this, but Reynolds never gave up.What we have here ladies and gentleman is one of the funniest films in a long time. It is so over the top hilarious at times, and so imaginative, you actually sit there watching the film, and think to yourself that there actually might be hope for Hollywood yet.I got to applaud marvel though. You can say a lot about the movie industry the last 10 years, which seems to be filled with super heroes. But marvel really know what they are doing. Making one great film after another, further building on their franchise and heroes. It is something DC isn't even close at replicating.But this is also where Deadpool comes in at the perfect time. It is a Satire, which makes fun of all the superhero movies, but at the same time it is in the same universe. That is truly amazing, it takes balls to do this, the intro sequence alone gives you a heads up how much guts it took to make this film.The film isn't perfect, few are. But it keeps on making you laugh and have a good time all the way through. And it is amazingly creative, this is a well written film, and the direction is rock solid. Mind boggling to think this is Miller's first film, absolutely amazing.And of course it has a lot of ""grown up"" language going, therefor the R Rating, which just adds to the total experience by a huge amount.And as a bonus you get an absolute gorgeous Morena Baccarin. I have been a fan of her all since Firefly, and she has had her ups and downs since then, but mostly ups. And here, in this film, she shines and are delivering a performance that fits her role so well, i can't think of anyone who could have done it better. Ryan Reynolds on the other hand is only in this film because he is handsome, this we all know. ;)Thanks for making this film guys, thanks for taking risks, thanks for daring to stand up for something and see it through, even if big studio executives are working against you. This was a very fun movie to watch, and i want you to make more!8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A fun and easy to watch film.,"Deadpool (2016) follows a man who, after getting experimented on, becomes immortal but physically scarred, and sets out to find the man who ruined his looks. This film is a fun, simple and easy watch which I really enjoy! For me, it stands out amongst other films created by Marvel.The humour was good! Not all the jokes were my type of humour, but I can totally tell how they're appealing to others. The opening is funny and ironic, and I absolutely love the fourth wall breaks which bring a unique feel to the jokes. I found that the use of the soundtrack also added a level of comedy and was used very well.The characters and acting were both good, and Ryan Reynolds is charismatic and the perfect fit for the lead. His character also has a unique and interesting origin story, not to mention he has a very 'one-of-a-kind' personality. Alongside this, I'd like to mention that I really liked Deadpool's design as it was super comic book accurate.The film was visually pretty decent and I loved some of the filming and editing techniques used. For example, the slo-mo, although used a lot, worked very well in my opinion. The cinematography was professional, however there weren't any colour palettes that stood out. The fight scenes looked fun too.Last of all, the pacing was fast so there was always something going on and the narrative was great. The movie was constantly entertaining with some funny references to pop culture and some very clear storytelling! In addition, it uses a lot of jumps in time which felt beneficial to the film overall.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"No sir, I don't like it.","This movie thinks it's a lot cooler, funnier & smarter then it actually is. I wouldn't say it's a bad movie or poorly made, but all around pretty flaccid and boring.Its basically the same old Superhero B.S. but packaged as something new & different by adding strong language, more gore, sex jokes, fart jokes, drug jokes, pop culture jokes, and some obscure references to make it seem like this isn't the equivalent of a modern day Boondock Saints.It's tough enough as it is to give a crap about super hero movies where there aren't really any stakes and already you know that there is gonna be sequels and the whole thing takes place in a fantasy world in general. By adding on a layer of self-referential artifice, Deadpool makes it even harder, if not nearly impossible, to give a crap about anyone or anything.In a lot of ways, it's like watching pornography for the story.

Great for what it is!,"I just seen Deadpool last night and I have to say it was pretty entertaining. First and foremost the ""you should be a shamed of yourself, this is crude and disgusting humor"" type of people only have themselves to blame for their poor experience. This IS who Deadpool is. I'm 100% sure those people had NO idea who Deadpool was and thought ""honey let's go see a lovely super hero movie tonight!"" They should be the ones ashamed of themselves for not doing research on a character they had no prior knowledge of...not to mention the ""R"" rating should have sent up some sort of red flag.P.S. Marvel Studios, the guys who have a hand in the Captain America, Thor, Iron Man movies... weren't the ones who made this film. Again, it just shows the ignorance of some of the reviewers reviewing this film.So moving past all of that and focusing on the positives of the film I'd like to start off by saying this movie does the Deadpool character justice. It's funny, violent, off the wall, and downright entertaining. My theater and I were laughing at just about every wise crack and joke made in the movie. My buddy who had no idea who Deadpool was even said that he thoroughly enjoyed it.There were a lot of subtle jokes in the movie as well that require you to have previous knowledge of past Ryan Reynolds films.Take the movie for what it is, entertainment.

Deadpool is dead cool,"First of all I love comic book movies so I'm pretty biased to begin with, but that been said I really enjoyed this. A lot!! I've always thought Ryan Reynolds was a great choice for ol dp. He started out great in wolverine origins then some genius had to ""improve "" on an already great character by making him unrecognisable from his comic book counterpart. I mean whoever thought the merc with the (sown up) mouth was a good idea should seriously get their had checked. Thankfully deadpool does what he does best in this movie. Run his mouth and kick ass spectacularly. It's pretty much nonstop action and laughs from the get go. Reynolds has redeemed himself with this as far as I'm concerned his motormouth fits deadpool perfectly. The rest of the cast are pretty good too. The villain is nothing special but not terrible either. The costume is spot on as is the humour and I would enjoy sitting through it again I'm sure. Only bad things I can think of is the movie is a little short or feels like it anyway and as I would have liked a little longer and would've liked his healing factor showcased a bit more.

Wildly entertaining. I'm just not sure where superhero movies go from here,"""Wildly entertaining"" is a fair summary, really. But here's the thing: dialing up the cartoon violence or infantile humor or detached irony has a downside. This movie spends so much time winking at the camera and making fun of itself that you start to wonder why you are even watching. It's as masturbatory as the jokes themselves. Granted, you remember why you are there every time you laugh your ass off (which happens frequently). But I'm not sure where this franchise or superhero movies in general go from here.

Best comedy (or movie) of 2016 in February? Possible.,"When a movie makes the entire audience laugh from the opening credits until the very last post-credits scene, you know it's definitely deserving of some awards.The sarcasm and rapid fire witty comments that are strategically placed through the entire movie in sometimes unexpected but still very natural ways, coupled with the ""been there done that"" vibe of clearly trying to poke fun at other action and hero movies is done exactly right. The non-linear story line coupled with a level of violence and sexual material we're not used to from the pg-13 hero movies and a huge amount of sarcasm and wit gives it almost a Quentin Tarantino meets Ben Stiller feel and it's absolutely awesome. There is nothing quite like this movie and it'll probably open up a whole new door for copycats.Considering this is the directing debut for Tim Miller, I think he hasquite the future ahead of him in directing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The Merc With a mouth  now in his own movie.,DEADPOOL is one of those great achievements in movies. It won't win any Oscars. But it will win cash lots of it. And it'll be well remembered as one of the best films of its time because its Fun. Ryan Reynolds is Deadpool. His delivery and comedic timing is superb. And he makes it clear. This is not a superhero movie. Deadpool is not a superhero. He's a merc for hire. he's paid to kill people. Itjust so happens that Deapool has a reason to have a conscience. He's got s soft spot for the little guy. Wade Wilson is a Mercenary who is hired out for work killing people. But He finds love with the lovely Vanessa and he feels like his life is now complete. He has love. He also has Cancer in the lungs prostrate and brain. So in order to extend his life he submits to a shady operation designed to cure him. What they want is another weapon. The operation is cruel its inhumane and its designed to create stress to activate Wade's mutant healing powers thanks to a mixture of a serum laced with Wolverine's blood. During this stress Wade becomes disfigured. And he escapes vowing to kill the people who did this to him. He's immortal but in pain. He's also got a grasp on the world few others don't. He can break the fourth wall. And he is literally insane as well. Deadpool's sense of humor tends to move towards the black parts of life. But he is funny. That sick sense of humor is what makes the movie. The story takes a turn for the worst when the thugs kidnap Vanessa and force Deadpool to come to them. With the help of Two of the X-men Deadpool goes into battle determined to kill and maim the bad guys . That's it the story in a nutshell.The Story works because of Reynolds. He is Deadpool he waited ten years to make this movie. And that was time well spent because they made a movie that is one of the best in the superhero/comic book genre. It does not take itself seriously. And avoids the clichés . Deadpool has to be seen on a movie screen to be appreciated. And watch it without kids . This is not a movie for the little ones.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Should you watch Deadpool? 100 words or less,"Deadpool was good, just like I had prayed it would be. For the most part everything the film had to offer was at the very least, well executed. However through all the comedy and action the thing that really stole the show, at least for me, was the story. The storytelling in this film was honestly better done than anything else, which is a compliment because the other aspects were quite good. You will come for the jokes, and Deadpool was overall a pretty funny movie, but the (admittedly clichéd) story will likely impress and surprise you.So should you watch Deadpool? Children stay away, everyone else yes go watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Thrilling Subversion of the Comic Book Movie Format,"This review may be incredibly biased, as I am a massive fan of comics (both Marvel and DC). I watched Deadpool on its opening night at the midnight showing. Being among the elite movie fans who stayed up late to see a movie on a weeknight, I had high expectations for this film. put quite simply, this movie blew my mind. Its humor worked every time and I, along with the rest of the audience, laughed to the point of tears consistently. The action was well shot and kept me interested and the movie finally does respect to the Deadpool character. The acting is good-enough, but Ryan Reynolds really shines through. You can clearly tell everyone was having fun the whole time during filming, and that made the film even more enjoyable. It should be known that this movie IS about Deadpool, so it really does earn its ""R"" rating. the language in this movie is consistently crude and the violence is as gratuitous as one may expect. Overall, if you know what you're walking into, you will love this movie. (Stay for the 2 after-credit scenes).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
An amazingly true adaption,"Deadpool truly is the role that Ryan Reynolds was born to play and this movie is an utterly phenomenal adaption of the property.The movie remains remarkably true to it's source material. There are fourth wall breaks within fourth wall breaks. Jokes at the expense of the actors playing the characters, at the expense of the cast and crew, the movie and comic book industries in general, comic book movies in particular, the history of the star in comic book movies, and more.The movie was clearly made for adults, although possibly not oriented towards our most mature and adult sides. It is utterly unsuitable for children, both in terms of graphic violence, sexual innuendo, graphic male nudity and hilariously scarring depictions of self affection. Even the end credit stick figure graphics include content that that is hilariously unsuitable for children.As a long time fan of the comic books, I was immensely happy with the movie. It was everything I could have hoped for from a Deadpool movie. It was low brow, offensive, violent, adult humor done extremely well. I think however that even for someone who is not an existing fan of the comics - the movie stands alone well as a brilliantly funny and irreverent spin on the comic book adaption genre. And in light of the news that a sequel has been green lit - it seems like a fantastic launch platform for a phenomenal franchise.I highly recommend that every adult who has ever appreciated super hero violence or laughed at a penis watch this movie at the first opportunity. I can't wait to watch it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Deadpool*******,"Ryan Reynolds was made for Deadpool, he is Deadpool. You've gotta give him praise for his performance as the character, then again I feel like he's just playing himself. The movie was a fast, funny, and fourth wall breaking. It was a straight forward and entertaining movie, you'd get a kick out of this, nonetheless. I enjoyed the chemistry Ryan Reynold's Wade Wilson/Deadpool & Morena Baccarin's Vanessa had, loved every scene when they're together. Only problem I had was the character is constantly trying to tell jokes during moments where it wasn't needed, which in my opinion, kills the flow. As a long time comic book fan, I understand Deadpool's character but that obviously isn't my cup of tea. Overall, a very good film. Director Tim Miller to me deserves a lot of credit too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
So Freakin' Cool!,"Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, 'Deadpool' is pure bad-ass entertainment! Despite being a ""SUPERHERO"" flick, this one's crass, non family-friendly, gruesome/graphic & relentless. But, thats its trump card. Its a trend-setter, in many ways!'Deadpool' Synopsis: A former Special Forces operative turned mercenary is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopting the alter ego Deadpool.'Deadpool' is a knockout. I loved Ant-Man & 'Deadpool' is equally engaging on all Marvel levels. The pace is Crisp, the Action-Sequences are Spectacular & the Protagonist is to die for. Played Magnficently by Ryan Reynolds, he as Wade Wilson/Deadpool, is wickedly fun & addictive. His unassuming charm, his crass language, his manic personality & his fighting-chops, all hold tremendous appeal. He's so unlike a regular Superhero & yet he's a Hero. Thats where 'Deadpool' scores enormously, its different & unabashed in its approach.Paul Wernick & Rhett Reese's Screenplay moves a brisk pace & offers enough scope for crazy humour & brilliant action. The Writing is tight all through. Tim Miller's Direction is top-notch. He has handled he film with command. Ken Seng's Cinematography is perfect. Julian Clarke's Editing is razor-sharp. Make-Up merits a special mention. Art & Costume Design are terrific. Graphics are WOW! Tom Holkenborg's Score is decent.Performance-Wise: Reynolds is a complete scene-stealer. He nails each & every punch of Deadpool, displaying tremendous flair for comedy & great intensity while breaking into a fight. Its a career-making performance & we finally, can move over Green Lantern. Morena Baccarin as Vanessa Carlysle, is perfect as the hero's lady-love. T.J. Miller as Weasel, is funny. Ed Skrein as Francis Freema /Ajax, is a super villain & scores in the action bits. Gina Carano as Angel Dust, is sexy. Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead & Stefan Kapičić as Peter Rasputi/Colossus (motion-capture), are just right.On the whole, 'Deadpool' is a B-L-O-C-K-B-U-S-T-E-R! There's no stopping this one!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Excellent, More please","Great movie full of great action, witty dialogue and crude humor, It's a brilliant origin story with great CGI, soundtrack and direction and editing.

"Funny, rude and very, very good!","I'm not a comic geek. Until Deadpool appeared in the Wolverine Origins film, I'd never heard of him. Apparently fans were incredibly outraged at that portrayal, and frankly, as the new Deadpool is supposed to be almost identical to the comic version, I can now see why. Reynolds is supposed to be a big Deadpool fan, and it really shows. The humour starts right at the beginning with a brilliant title sequence that sets the scene. The audience is almost a participating player in the film, such is the level of breaking the fourth wall. It's not so much broken as reduced to rubble and crunched under Deadpool's feet! I wasn't sure if I'd take to that but it was just brilliant. This is the superhero film for adults that we've been waiting on. Yes, there's a lot of swearing, but it's really very in context. Yes there are hints at DP's supposed sexual interests but that's presumably for later films. I loved the referencing of the other X-men films. I loved the poking fun at other superheroes. I loved the humour and even the violence was so well choreographed that it was fun rather than horrific, and it was very tongue in cheek. Which is probably a sexual reference somewhere as well... I loved remarks like 'smells like a franchise...' it was just so OTT and funny that the audience was laughing out loud as indeed was I a couple of times. I now know the backstory to Deadpool and am looking forward to him taking his rightful place among the best of the superheroes. I will definitely get it on Blu-ray when it comes out (I expect it will break a whole new set of records when it comes out) and I look forward to the second instalment. My only fear is that any follow-ups can't possibly maintain the humour, the insanity and the sheer pace of the jokes and one-liners that this film brought. Reynolds brings his A-game and blows the X men out of the water.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A novelty. Good movie.,"I was entertained from start to finish, I chuckle from time to time, and I enjoyed the ""R"" rating for what it was.Also, the movie is juvenile all the time, the story and characters other than Deadpool are totally forgettable (which is fine), and most of jokes passed without producing anything on me. Why so serious, you ask?Nothing. The movie it was ok. I enjoyed and that's it.Those who get to enjoy more the adolescent humor would get a better time, because that's a huge junk of the movie.It is good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Confused, wanted to like it but just couldn't","First of all I like Marvel/Superhero films bit of mindless escapism for an hour or two but Deadpool.....humm left me confused.I'm a geek,nerd (albeit a rather big one)but one thing that geeks and nerds can't do is humour, Big Bang gets away with it because it's geek humour not trying to be anything but geek humour where Deadpool falls flat is it's geeks trying to be cool which just doesn't work.The only reason I give it 5 out of 10 is because of Morena Baccarin who's woefully under used in most films. The film itself just feels like a procession of adverts spread over nearly 2 hours, couple minutes of dialogue then action scene couple of minutes dialogue then action scene rinse repeat.If being an anti hero is as simple as just being annoying glib when everything is going to pot, then possibly the UK has around 30 million anti-hero's walking around. Sarcasm and dry wit is something Americans just can't do well (with a couple of notable exceptions, Bill Murray being one).The whole thing just stank of laziness. Possibly a great film for teenagers and emotionally/socially immature people but as for the rest just a silly predictable and pretty unfunny film.Not going to remark too much on the lead actor apart from the fact that he was much more interesting in the film before he actually became Deadpool when he was just Wade.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"A different super-hero movie, but in a good way","The movie is funny, violent, and above all, good. The value of entertainment here is very high. Deadpool has a simple story, but well executed and well explained, it leaves no doubt to the viewer. Ryan Reynolds is really fine, he passes the whole essence of the comic character to the film. The flashbacks are funny scenes, but they break a bit of the movie rhythm, break the excitement of the previous scene when you were seeing Wade Wilson as Deadpool (mentioning that Gina Carano is a bad actress, she has no charisma at all and in all of her scenes, she has a "" little smile "" on the face , breaking the climate of acting). Another downside is that, because of this simple story, the film seems vague, as if it needed something else to fill like more action scenes or character's delusions. After all, Deadpool is full of iconic scenes and good actors (especially the Brazilian actress Morena Baccarin, who is great), it has great special effects and CGI, and an excellent edition. Great film with explicit violence and bad taste jokes. A good Tim Miller work which I will probably watch again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The Superhero of Snark,"I do not follow the comic books so I was only familiar with the previous introduction to Deadpool in the first Wolverine movie. Needless to say, it seems only one guy can get away with this role. The movie shows how relentless our main character is with the wisecracks. It's Shane Black on steroids. There is a certain sustained triggering of the funny bone, like a good stand-up comedy act. After awhile, enough of the good gags landed that you could forgive the ones that fell flat. What about the supporting characters? I felt Morena Baccarin worked as the love interest, who has enough of a wild side to tolerate Wade Wilson (the name will always make me think of the former Vikings quarterback). Wade has a dorky buddy at the local vigilante club who can be funny with his meekness in a Steve Zahn kind of way.The film moves briskly along, with the banter dictating the pace. There are several flashbacks, with the first moment of Deadpool breaking the fourth wall bringing to mind Francis Underwood in ""House of Cards"". Except Underwood didn't make a breaking the fourth wall joke. Nothing is taboo or too snarky in this script. Indeed, it almost seems room was left for alternate punch lines for a few gags.I liked the new wave approach to the now stagnating superhero formula. I was almost thankful this was a minor superhero film, with no cities being destroyed, or alien takeover of the planet. There was room for a smaller point of view in the cinematography as well. Perhaps like ""Watchmen"", small details can be given room to be appreciated. Like a good popcorn film, the filmmakers made sure we were having fun along the way.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

In terms for problems for this film there are very few, there was some cut content which was in the trailer but not in the finished film but these are just a few jokes and one liners.

Also, Deadpool himself is just too quippy at times and it became annoying after a while.2) There's nothing original at all about the film's plot and it is quite boring in places.3) Because of the low-budget nature of the film, there are definitely times where the special effects look noticeably bad, which took me out of the film at times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"vulgar, crude, violent, semi-pornographic...and awesome!!","when I heard of the early screenings of Deadpool i automatically jumped on IMDb to find out what some of the early viewers thought about it. one gentlemen said ""It contained filthy, obscene and crude language and actions in every scene. It was shockingly dark in humor. I can't believe this was a Marvel character. I am appalled at what the movie industry considers entertaining."" another lady exclaimed ""The fact that this film has already been given an 8.9 is, quite frankly, disturbing and one of the many reasons god doesn't talk to us anymore!!"" yes ladies and gentlemen...god. All I could think was, what kind of scenes exist in this movie that would shock even the lights of whathisname and whogivesashh.. this movie must be extremely offensive, hyper sexual and vulgar. I mean for f@*ks sake, even god stopped talking to us. I must watch it, and I did :D. all I can say is, they're right about the vulgarity and hyper sexual scenes, they're right about the crud jokes and excessive violence. they're right about everything. what they fail to mention is the rest of the story. this story is really kind of sorta sweet in a twisted kind of way. some of the best scenes in this movie were when Wade(deadpool) and Vennesa, Wades girlfriend, where together. it was a really nice love story between the two of them...once you get passed all the sex, which granted, was a lot for a 2 minute montage. the supporting characters Negasonic Teenage Warhead whom i'm going to call NTW from now on, and Colossus, were perfect for this movie. Colossus was like a giant metallic teddy bear trying to change Deadpool's anti-heroic ways, and learn the way of the X-men. NTW was your everyday emo girl with nuclear power. the repertoire between Deadpool and NTW was perfect as was the constant nagging of Colossus trying to stop Deadpool from killing... eeeveryone. TJ Miller plays the bartender and Wades best friend. every scene he's in is hilarious. basically this was a laugh out loud, violent twisted and very romantic story. this is not a nice happy PG-13 action movie like Antman okay this is a fun R rated action comedy that takes it to the next level. I haven't laughed so hard in the theaters in years. seriously go watch it, or don't, honestly its not for everyone. if you want to go to the movies for a nice pleasant chuckle kind of time, its best you go watch something else. you don't want God not talking to you over a movie okay.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
What is this world coming to?,"There was a time in film making history where movies were much more family oriented, wholesome for both children and adults. That isn't to say there wasn't already a separation between children and adult films. Though adult films were approached more conservatively and were cautious about how they were presented. That approach has been lost today in society as morality is being forgotten as something of the past and the future is immorality. This is Deadpool as a film.Ryan Reynolds was undoubtedly the perfect choice to play the iconic character Deadpool, the foul-mouthed, sexually active, vulgar and merciless kill dudes left, right and center mercenary. The character represents everything that used to be considered wrong and immoral to humanity. To sum up Deadpool's focal points, the graphic violence is gut-wrenching all throughout (although some if it is fun), the humor as funny as it can be sometimes is crude and vulgar. Sex is active in this movie, very active. What's more shocking coming from a Catholic perspective is how this is what society calls entertainment. Obviously this film is not geared towards children as anyone opposed to this viewers opinion would say and while that may be true, it is also false. How can anyone say Deadpool isn't geared toward children (the film definitely not) when his costumed appearance is already attractive for them as well as the fact that he is portrayed in cartoon shows and video games already geared toward a younger audience? This film overall represents how ugly we have become as a culture.That isn't to say the film's not without it's good moments. This is the reason for the 5 star rating. The action can be very impressive to see how it was filmed. The humor at certain times is clever and is delivered excellently. There is one character who stands out way more than Deadpool himself and that is the character of Colossus who ironically represents everything that's right in the world trying to remind everyone of morality and being correct, though that isn't explored for much in the film. That being said, with the upcoming sequel about to be released in May, it is clear it will be no different than the originals. Standards are lost in the film industry disappointingly, but there are still several individuals who need to be protected from the lies of the world and that is the most vulnerable: the children. They must be protected from films like this because until the One up above returns, our culture doesn't seem to want to learn this truth.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Must see film of the season,"Finally a superhero film that urinates all over decorum, and well, on just about everything else really, especially other marvel characters. Talking about which, I must say I am seriously impressed that marvel has once again been able to make something out of very little.This is for all intents and purposes just another revenge film. There's nothing particularly original about Deadpool but with snappy, foul mouth and clever dialogue, a frenetic pace, fantastic visual effects and an opening sequence that will blow your socks off, this rates as one of the best examples of what Hollywood can achieve if you allow certain individuals to run free with their passion.In Deadpool, Ryan Reynolds played the titular role for laugh out loud entertainment. Morena Baccarin is gorgeous and delivers her sometimes equally foul mouth rants with glee. I think it's fair to say that everyone in the film appeared to have had an absolute ball. Tipping my hat to the director Tim Miller for his directorial debut. The opening scene alone almost had me in spasms, it's exciting to see such talent coming out of mainstream Hollywood.Loved the soundtrack, loved the visuals, loved the sick humour, loved the lead actors, but I didn't really get the role of those x-men characters.

This might hurt a bit...,"Despite the film's huge box office success, I was never really interested in watching 'Deadpool' - mainly due to many negative reviews about the film's profanity, and because I'm not really into slapstick.While this is indeed a very rude and crude film with more sexual and gay jokes than donuts at a police precinct, it was more entertaining than expected. I mean, there's bucket loads of satire, and while there is plenty of slapstick humour, there's also some really funny moments. Ryan Reynolds, off course, steals the show as the titular character and couldn't have been a better casting call.

Deadgood.,"Former special Ops solider and now a mercenary, Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is enjoying a passionate relationship with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). On the day he proposes, he collapses and discovers that he has very late stage cancer. Desperate, he agrees to undergo a mysterious procedure that will cure him and also make him a ""hero"" but the procedure actually involves activing his latent mutant genes following extensive torture. Left for dead, Wilson's mutant healing factor saves his life and allows him to pull on a red suit, call himself Deadpool and strike out for revenge.The plot is only half the fun though, less than half in fact. With the shackles off and a relatively low budget mitigating much of the risk, ""Deadpool"" is a violent, foul mouthed action-comedy, with Reynolds and writers allowed to crack jokes about their careers, the state of superhero movies and other facets of pop culture as Deadpool breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the audience.This was my third or fourth viewing of the film, watched ahead of seeing the sequel. If I am truthful, some of the lustre does start to come off after a few repeat viewings. Some of the more accessible comedy moments, the trailer ones particular - like Angels' ""superhero landing"" gag are all a bit too familiar now. It's interesting though that the self-referential style of humour has permeated outside of ""Deadpool"" to become common place in the subsequent films of the MCU, if not quite to the extent that it does here.Plot wise, it's all fairly straightforward despite some time jumps in the first two thirds of the film. For the budget though, the action scenes are pretty strong, particularly the scenes involving a downed helicarrier at the conclusion.Still good, just overexposed a little now.

Deadpool is a perfectly serviceable superhero film that collapses into a puddle of mediocrity.,"Deadpool is a Perfectly Serviceable Superhero Film""Deadpool"" tries hard to be unique with its clever voice-overs and dialogue, its flash backs and foreshadowing. But the harder it tries to be different, the more it is the same.There are damsels in distress, a revenge tale, a face off between the damaged superhero and the deranged supervillain and on and on. They even tell you in the credits about all the typical elements of a superhero movie that will be present. The credits are, to their credit, very funny.There is an origin story that is quite interesting, but there is also the too long courting ritual and the overly long bar scene (what the hell, directors, bars aren't that interesting!) showing us where the hero gets his name. While the romantic coupling in the film is extremely unlikely and it is a boring plot device that takes us away from the real action.The fight scene at the beginning of the film is very entertaining and well choreographed; however, they seemed to have run out of ideas by the time of the great, and predictable, final showdown.I know it is hard to come up with new ideas for a superhero movie, and ""Deadpool"" does a fairly good job of presenting a different kind of tale. However, the film gets a case of the ""box office flu"" and puts in a lot of standard and unfortunately predictable elements in the film.Sure, Deadpool's origin story is well done if not original. And his living situation is unique, to say the least. But the romance falls flat and is out of place. The times when the movie is more entertaining is during the conflict with the cruel villain, ""Francis"" and during the development of Deadpool's powers. The bar scene is too long, the sex scene it superfluous and not clever, and much of the film is filler for the action scenes. Perhaps I have seen too many superhero films and I am too critical to sit through them and accept the genre's failings. Dead Pool gives me little hope that this will change. The film looks okay, but after the original fight scene, its visuals are nothing spectacular.The acting is average, at best, and Morena Baccarin seems out of place in many of the scenes. She's not sure how to play the role of the victim or how to be overly sexual and in love. To be fair, she's not known for nuance and her role is terribly written. The writing in general is too clever by five-eighths; it's dull and after a while, tiresome. The film's humour and sentimentality don't mix well at all. In fact, the film is best and most powerful when it eschews sentimentality.If the film had ended after thirty minutes, I would have given it high marks. However, it collapsed into a puddle of mediocrity. This does not bode well for the upcoming, supposedly genre bending superhero film, ""Suicide Squad."" A better version of the ""Deadpool"" would have had the 'hero' in a cab all day going from one villain's hideout to the next and causing a ruckus.Ratings: MatinéeThere are clever bits interspersed in the film like a sketch comedy show, and that kept me entertained for some the show. If you really like this genre, then by all means, see ""Deadpool."" If you don't enjoy superhero films, there is nothing in this film to change that.Stan Lee's cameo is a bonus, however.Peace, Tex Shelters",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Comedy, Sex, Violence, Bad language, and Wham!!","Hood Review: DeadPoolQuick Hits:It is rated R for a good reason. - Comedy, Sex, Violence, Bad language, and Wham!!The laughs roll in right from the opening credits, which themselves are HEE-LARIOUS. Ryan Reynolds did his thug thang in this one, great performance and perfect casting. I really didn't expect to like Deadpool as much as I did. The trailers and media blitz was starting to irritate the hell out of ya boy. But this movie was downright enjoyable on all levels. There were times I grimaced at a Deadpool finishing move, times I literally LOL'd, times I could not turn away from the action, and times I was like ""WTF""? The overall story was a little lacking as it was pretty obvious that Deadpool's, and Francis's (the bad guy) backstory took a backseat to the slapstick humor and assholistic nature of Deadpool. But, you know what? Not only was that aaight with me, it actually was refreshing. The producers gave us a lil bit then just hit the gas on the action and humor. Which came in very abundant flurries. The movie moves very fast and straightforward all the time, no pause and or detours. Also featured the BEST Stan Lee cameo to date. The computer graphics were definitely on point, though Colossus looked waaaay different than in the other Marvel/Fox joints.Something I noticed and not sure if this was done on purpose but Deadpool had that Sharknado, B-movie feel to it. The violence and comedy mixed together were so over the top. That normally would have me like ""What""?, ""Man GTFOH"". But some how it just works in this movie.This is a definite must see. Deadpool is a genius mix of elements that normally do not go together. Like the soundtrack for example. Wham!! and DMX! Nuff said.I give Deadpool 5 EBTs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
sexy and funny,I enjoyed watching this movie and I'm not a big fan of super hero movies!,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Everything a Deadpool fan was expecting AND MORE!,"I cant without a doubt say that this might be the funniest movie I've watched. The comedy is amazing and not for the fans but for everyone not even knowing who deadpool is and for those who knows deadpool. I don't think the comedy could be more fitting and awesome. As everyone keeps saying, Ryan Reynolds was perfect for this role and after Wolverines movies disaster of a deadpool. This was just amazing. I've known Deadpool from before and I know what type of comedy and personality he and his stories have. DeadPool has a very unique personality, not like Wolverines anger or Xaviers deep voice with cool headedness. His style is very unique and very challenging to live up to, what with the creative jokes and comedy but I cant believe how this movie might even brought that up even one more lever. Its not that ""huge blowing multitrillion dollar Airships and cities"" kind off SuperHero movie but more a movie that is more down to earth with a huge twist in it called DeadPool who keeps making fun of his and others franchise all the time by doing what he does most: Braking the fourth wall. I would deeply recommend ANYONE to watch this movie and especially for those who know who DeadPool is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
(Anti)hero as we needed,"There is no other hero like Deadpool. Created and invented in 1991 by Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza from Marvel Comics, character had fast become on of the most memorable heroes of this universe. His unique and vulgar sense of humor with his awareness of being just the comic figure made him favorite Marvel mutant for many readers. However, the reasons of success of the comic novels was also the causes of reluctance of creating the movie based on them. Nowadays, when you can't find much blood or brutal violence in super-hero scores and there is no single imprecation in them, it's hard to believe, that the movie like ""Deadpool"" could succeed in any way, especially if it was rated as ""restricted"" on the cinema's repertoires. How movie about mutant would earn big money without young viewers? It's impossible, right? Right?! Fortunetly, Fox have taken the risk to find out about that.All of the super-hero franchises always have the same problem: screenwriters can not dare to show as something new and original. So, we get the next stories like ""let's save the world guys!"". We love such movies, but to be honest - we have been a little tired with new productions like ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" or ""Fantastic Four"". We needed something fresh, something absolutely new. Film with new conceptions in showing the story. And that's how we get ""Deadpool""!Directed by not well known Tim Miller, movie doesn't even much care about the plot itself, because it isn't so necessary in this case. It's just the origin story, connected with romance (in order to release the movie during the Valentine weekend, of course). The fact that film is quite short (it takes less than two hours to hit to the end credits) can make you sure, that you won't fell boring at any moment. Every single scene is full of ribald jokes, gallows humor and untypical Marvel easter-eggs. Deadpool breaks the fourth wall to the ground, humiliate Hugh Jackam like he was his favorite villain...he even humiliate himself! Who could stop him from doing that?! Who would dare?!Miller's score is one of the best comic adaptations of all the time. It doesn't only fit to original stories perfectly, but also show them from the new perspective. It's also a great evidence, that super-hero kind movies do not have to be imitative, predictable and based mostly on the same ideas. Although, the plot in ""Deadpool"" may seems to be chaotic, screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (they both have worked on 2009's ""Zombieland"") have made a impressive work, by connecting black comedy with love story and also X-Men franchise. And it's really crazy mixture. But it's the movie about our lovely Deadpool - it has to be insane!""Deadpool"" wouldn't have happened without insistent efforts of Ryan Reynolds. Almost forty actor wanted to produce the film about dressed in red mutant since ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", where he played Wade Wilson in a very...strange way, with sewed up mouth and extra-long adamantium blades. He's been trying to convinced 20th Century Fox for almost six years to shoot single Deadpool movie. He believed, that he was born to take this role. Now we can see, that he was right. Movie belongs to him at all. He doesn't have to play Deadpool. He is Deadpool. He literally invented him, created him and brought him to live on the big screen. Altought, most of the cast are very talented personalities, no one of them is able to have any match for Reynolds. He steals the whole show. So pity, that two of three main actress - Gina Carano and Brianna Hildebrand - don't even try to be so aspiring...I'm curious: what have thought the ""Deadpool"" producers after first opening weekend? How have they reacted? They haven't believed in the success of the movie, they used to be sure, that such kind of production, directed only to adult viewers can not earn big money. I hope, that they're still shocked. ""Deadpool"" is a proof, that you don't need two hundred million dollars to create great super-hero franchise. All what it's going to take is a brave decision to create something special, something different than typical film, using adored character, played by actor with passion to do that. And that's all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Love At First Sight: Deadpool Entertains Like No Other,"Ever since the abomination that was X-Men: Origins - Wolverine, fans have been dying to see a true and honest adaptation of the super- vulgar, mega-violent Merc With a Mouth, AKA, Deadpool. And, thanks to a fortunate leak of test footage in July of 2014, the day finally came much to the delight of myself and fans around the world. Simply put, there couldn't have been a better, more faithful and more entertaining film put on screen; Deadpool is one of a kind.There are many things that make Deadpool well, Deadpool, and each and every one of those things are alive and well in the film. Pervasive language? Check. Over-the-top, gory violence? Check. Breaking the fourth wall? Absolutely perfect costume? Excessive sexual content, and the greatest (if most mature) sense of humor in all of superhero history? Check, check, check and CHECK! The undeniable dedication of source material from the film's writers and director Tim Miller is felt heavily in the movie, and there's nothing that the comic book faithful wanted more.Watching Deadpool and his alter ego Wade Wilson swear like no tomorrow, crack countless jokes pertaining to other superhero movies among other hilarious subjects, and plow through bad guys with studious amounts of gore is down right fun to watch, leaving me with a smile on my face the entire time the camera was rolling. The character of Deadpool himself is arguably the greatest adaptation of any superhero (or anti-hero if you see it that way) in cinema history, a testament to the unrelenting passion of the superhero genre fan base. Fox may have destroyed the Fantastic Four, but Deadpool could not have been brought to life in a more absolutely perfect way.Now, the man behind the mask. Outside of maybe Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Ryan Reynolds has proved to be one of the greatest castings for a comic book hero, ever. Reynolds pushed for this film ever since his first portrayal of Deadpool in the aforementioned pile of garbage that was Origins - Wolverine, wanting more than anything to properly display the character, without a sewed- up mouth. The marketing campaign for the film alone cemented Reynolds into this role for as long as he'd like, with every ounce of Deadpool's character played spot on by the man who once played Green Lantern (which he jokes about in the film). He delivers his lines perfectly, acts like the total nut job that Deadpool is, makes you laugh out loud and also is able to pull at your heart's strings occasionally. Few actors can so closely resemble their comic book character, and Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson/Deadpool is one of those actors.The plot was as good as it needed to be, diving into Deadpool's origins through flashbacks showing how Wade Wilson transformed into the wise- cracking mercenary while maintaining the action and humor that the movie is all about. Along with Reynolds, supporting actors Morena Baccarin (Vanessa) T.J. Miller (Weasel), Stefan Kapicic (Colossus) and antagonist Ed Skrein (Ajax) all provide great support to the film, whether it's Weasel's comedic relief (to an action-comedy) Vanessa's love interest, Colossus's wonderful action or the awesome villain that is Ajax. The cast is great and helps Reynolds along the way of dominating the screen.Deadpool is easily the most raunchy, hilarious and mature rated character in Marvel's roster, a character few ever thought would receive the film he deserved. Not only did he get his movie, but it's an instant classic. The attention to detail in the characters source material, perfectly showcasing the extremities of Deadpool lead the way for Ryan Reynolds to own the role of Wade Wilson/Deadpool and wildly entertain from the opening credits (literally) to after the credits role (literally). Deadpool is a love letter to the fans, and what once was a strong cult following has turned into a global phenomenon. Deadpool reserves its right as one of the best comic book films of all- time.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The anti-superhero superhero movie,"I was very curious about and eagerly awaiting to see this film as the reviews about this one were overly positive despite some criticism left and right. Well I can tell you right of the bat: this movie is fracking awesome! So the naysayers were dead wrong (pun intended). It was a very bold move putting the same actor who played a much despised version of Deadpool in X-Men Origins in a completely different movie. But they play it very smart: deadpool is a smart-mouth character and says basically everything what he (and the audience) is thinking. This makes for some very good jokes and the humor (though some might call it crude or a bit offensive) is just excellent and works great! As terrible as Reynolds was in Origins, here he embodies the character perfectly. The script is written very well and the director (a director and creative producer for CGI shortfilms and cinematics at Blur Studios) clearly understands the material and has knack for bringing it to the screen in the right way. You could say this is the anti-superhero superhero movie. After all the 'straight' superhero flicks of which we might have seen too many, this is a fresh breeze and welcome addition to the genre. So if you see one superhero movie this year see Deadpool. If you are sick of or hate superhero movies this is also right up your alley. Very highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Two of the hottest actors of this era both with their own comic flair.  LOVED THIS,"I'm so glad that Ryan and DC parted ways, though I liked GL, I loved Mr. Pool. I've been enamored of Morena Baccarin since I first saw her appear in Firefly, perhaps my favorite series ever, and perhaps the most beautiful, sweet and funny actress I've ever seen.Before the movie even started, I knew it would be a favorite, if not the. Asshats aside, the opening was brilliant, previewing the fun to come in one of the most creative ways I've ever seen.The interactions of the two stars were magical, and truly believable, and this ride took me through my full range of emotions, as most movies only dream they could do.I knew NOTHING of Deadpool before seeing this, as I was a DC comic fan as a child, which may have been why I loved this movie so much... something new for a change. Marvel has blown DC completely out of the water since they started their new universe with the newest HULK in 2008 (X-Men was barely passable), well, until S v B, which I loved almost as much as this. Keep it up Marvel, and get to work on this sequel!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

What a Blast! Most fun I've had with a Superhero film so far.,"This is a superhero origin movie about Deadpool, who's more of an anti-hero. With all the great marketing and dedication by Ryan Reynolds and the team behind it, the movie had garnered immense hype and it was really pleasing to see the movie live up to it.Ryan Reynolds was born for this role. He personified Deadpool perfectly. He was simply amazing. Loved him. Aside from him, the secondary cast did a really good job as well. I loved Morena Baccarin as the love interest for Deadpool and very surprisingly, their romance subplot was handled very well, something that is very rare, especially considering I usually hate lovey dovey stuff. They had great chemistry and I would say they are probably the best superhero couple in my opinion after Spiderman and Gwen in The Amazing spiderman movies. T.J Miller as Deadpool's friend was great and had some really funny lines. Loved Colossus and the other teenage mutant, movie handled them very well. Hell, even the Indian cab driver guy was funny and good in his small role.From the awesome opening credits to the funny after credits scene, Deadpool was a blast. It was very tightly packed with little to no breathing room at all. The movie really flowed with jokes, action, romance etc, all interwoven very nicely. The movie was small in scale and I think it was a good thing. They focused on all the right points, mainly Deadpool, and it paid off. It had Deadpool's signature 4th wall breaks and humor and was perfectly crafted in the film. So many utterly hilarious moments in the film where I actually laughed out loud. I tell ya, I was having so much fun with this film that during half time, I could have sworn that only 15-20 mins have passed by. Seriously, the movie flew by me so fast, it was almost weird. It is almost 2 hours long and it felt like half that long.The movie is rated R, and it fully utilizes it. There is tons and tons of crude jokes and curses, Deadpool s*** talks here and there all the time. The action is bloody and gory. There is nudity and sex. I mean this is a Rated R movie through and through and it was just really refreshing to see a superhero movie like this. Plus, you can't do Deadpool justice in any other way.Relative to other superhero movies, Deadpool had a small budget, and it sometimes showed. CGI was a bit shoddy at times but the way they incorporated it in scenes and didn't made it a CGI fest, it looked mostly fine. The action scenes were great and entertaining.Villain was a bummer though. Ajax a.k.a Francis was just like the opening credits defined him, just some British villain guy. He was uninteresting, had little to no development and was evil for the sake of being evil. But funnily enough, he still worked for the movie cause all it really needed was a target for Deadpool and Ajax fitted that bill perfectly. So it's more of like a nitpick then a real negative but still I would have liked it if the villain was more fleshed out.All in all, this is easily the funniest superhero movie I have watched to date, beating Guardians of the Galaxy, and was also my funnest cinema experience so far. It's one of those rare movies that is made by fans for the fans but also caters to non-fans. I myself didn't know much about Deadpool but I still enjoyed the hell out of this film. It is great to see this film being successful cause now Fox, and hopefully other studios too, will take more chances and give the teams more freedom. I guess Fox redeemed themselves after that disaster of a film, Fant4stic. A must watch.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

One Of The Best Superhero Films Since The Dark Knight Rises,"Deadpool is one of the best films so far of 2016 and one of the best superhero films since The Dark Knight Rises. The marketing for this film is some of the best but I was worried that the film wouldn't live up to the hype. So I went into this film with low expectations. When I came out of the film I LOVED this movie. Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool and he gave one of his best performances of his career. The film is directed very well from first time director Tim Miller. I honestly thought there would be shaky camera action but I was wrong. The action is quick, fast, and very brutal. One of the best things for this movie is the writing. The movie is very funny and it's one of the best comedies that came out in recent year. I do agree with the film being R rated because it fits with the character and if this film was PG-13 it wouldn't be good and the film would hardly have a story to tell and I do hope they start to make more superhero films R rated.

Overwhelmingly funny and action-packed!,"Deadpool is definitely a comedy worth seeing. I saw a packed screening and the people in the theater laughed almost non-stop, and my dad admitted that it was a film worth watching again. The action and special effects are loads of fun, but beware that there's a lot of blood and gore invested. Same goes for the humor-the gags are often juvenile and crass(such as sexual activity on a holiday or hinting at ""touching"" oneself's), so this is FAR from a family film. Deadpool is a great time at the movies, but just expect more adult material from the typical average Marvel film. If there's one thing the movie does often, it frequently breaks the 4th wall, and it's one of the really great things about Deadpool.

Definitely Not Suited for a General Audience,"This film essentially begins with a mercenary by the name of ""Wade Wilson"" (Ryan Reynolds) learning that he has contracted an incurable form cancer and only has a short time to live. Needless to say, his new fiancé ""Vanessa"" (Morena Baccarin) is devastated and, rather than having her endure the agony of watching him die, he decides to leave without telling her. Strangely enough, upon his departure, he is approached by a mysterious man who offers him an experimental cure in exchange for his complete cooperation with his superiors immediately afterward. He agrees and is then injected with a serum and subsequently subjected to a multitude of extremely painful procedures at the direction of a sadistic psychopath named ""Ajax"" (Ed Skrein ). Incredibly enough, the serum not only works, but he is transformed into an almost indestructible being in the process. Unfortunately, that same procedure has also left him horribly disfigured as well--and for that reason he assumes the new secret identity of ""Deadpool"" and makes it his mission to kill Ajax and destroy his clandestine criminal organization at all costs. Now, rather than revealing any more, I will just say that I knew going in that this was a graphic film which contained vulgar language and scenes of a sexual nature. So, I wasn't too surprised. What was surprising, however, was how likeable and funny such a foul-mouthed lout turned out to be overall--with his best friend ""Weasel"" (T. J. Miller) being particularly humorous.

For one, it breaks the fourth wall - that barrier between the film and the audience. This results in the kind of viewer involvement that is both endearing and extremely refreshing. You'll see yourself laughing out loudly throughout the whole movie. It catches you from the start till the end.I've rated it a 8/10 because of the basic storyline.

"A silly, raunchy trip into Marvel Land","There was no escaping 'Deadpool' when it was released back in 2016. The raunchy anti-hero Marvel offering struck a chord with audiences who were looking for something a little more ""in your face"" than the Disney-fied films that were being churned out at breakneck speed.Of course, what helped set this film apart from its peers was the fact that it leaned into comedy over drama. Ryan Reynolds is a versatile actor, but he is most believable when he's making people laugh. As Wade Wilson, Reynolds helps viewers forget his performance as a forgettable DC Comics superhero and gets to flex one-liners and double-entendres while consistently breaking the fourth wall and slicing and dicing his enemies in a variety of creative ways.Yes, this movie is almost nearly completely the RR show, but the supporting cast of Morena Baccarin, T. J. Miller, Karan Soni and Ed Skrein among others help round out the other on-screen faces. Baccarin in particular is a formidable match to Reynolds, as the two of them go toe-to-toe in a fun way throughout the 108 minutes of silliness. There are also plenty of real-world and ""X-men"" universe references and easter eggs that are fun to keep track of throughout.'Deadpool' wins points for its wittiness and unseriousness while still maintaining a sense of originality.

"Funny, violent, and irreverent superhero action comedy that demands for your attention","Superhero films based on Marvel comics (as well as DC comics) are often subject for the most anticipated films of their years, and usually come out with impressively rich box office receipts, even when they fail to make a lasting impression. This film, operated by first-time director Tim Miller, is a unique turn for the comic-book genre. The centric figure of this superhero action comedy is the crude, merc-of-the- mouth anti-hero everyone knows as Deadpool. The irreverent, foul-mouthed hero, wielding his blades and firearms like John McClane on crack, splashes into the screen with an audacious approach very few comic books have gone before. He is not your average Marvel Comics hero for those who have grown accustomed to typical figures like Spiderman, Thor, and Captain America. He is a wise-cracking guy with a patent of breaking the fourth wall, cracking down on raunchy one-liners, and dispatching his enemies in a violent, gory fashion that superbly hence the R-rating. And it is up to Ryan Reynolds to bring his charismatic hero to life that not only remains faithful to the popular source material, but serves justice to title character's lifeless appearance in 'X-Men Origins'. This film follows Wade Wilson (played by Ryan Reynolds), a hard- headed New York City mercenary who falls in love with Vanessa (played by Morena Baccarin), the girl of his dreams. As these two fall into an adorable relationship, Wade soon finds his life in danger when he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. The only one is capable of helping him fight this disease is an artificially mutated scientist Dr. Francis Freeman a.k.a. Ajax (played by Ed Skrein) who subjects him to an experiment that quickly goes awry and turns into a red, sickish-looking monster. To matters worse, he kidnaps Vanessa. So it is up to Wade to save her. Suiting up in red wetsuit, an arsenal of firearms and ammunition, and adopts his egotistical identity Deadpool, he teams up with X-Men hero Collossus (voiced by Stefan Kapicic) and his teenage trainee Negasonic Teenager Warhead (played by Brianna Hildebrand) to save her.Following the origin story of the loud-mouth hero, director Tim Hill wastes no potential when portraying the irreverent nature of the eponymous character, nor does Ryan Reynolds on capturing the crude, over-the-top personality that makes him such an charismatic, yet raunchy figure. The film finds an even balance of gut-busting hilarity and pulse-pounding actions sequences to meet a satisfying showcase of the merc-of-the-mouth hero, and that the elements of both the film and the character himself acknowledging his comedic resonance. This is best demonstrated in the opening credits which is generates to some laughter for its creativity. But when our hero comes face-to-face with against the baddies, that is when the real fun begins as our hero cracks down on some hilarious one-liners that strong at hitting the funny bone. However, if you have read the comics, you know that is the not the same kind of fun you would expect in more family-friendly entries like 'The Avengers' or 'Captain America', there are plenty of crude jokes, four-letter words, and more than enough blood and gore to justify its R-rating. So parents, if you plan on taking your children to this, you are in for a rude awakening. Nonetheless, it is an entertaining ride thanks to Ryan Reynolds who shines like gold in the role, spewing one laugh after another with his striking comedic indulgence as does T.J Miller as the comic relief character. Ed Skrein makes a good impression as the main villain. But let's get real, it is Reynolds who is takes the show, especially in the scenes of him breaking the fourth wall and being a wise-ass.Deadpool is a violet, crass, yet wildly entertaining superhero action comedy that desperately demands for the attentions of all comic books fans, and most of everyone else. It is a big thrill ride that marks an impressive achievement for director Tim Miller. And as it is worth mentioning, make sure to stay for the post-credits scene if you are interested in a moment of both laughter and nostalgia. Well, at least for some.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Welcome Change.,"As a loyal comic book fan I found this a pleasant change from all the recent pg kiddie films. The action scenes are spectacular. The humor is adult and mature. Visuals are also stunning and good for its budget.Deadpool is at his best. That being said Deadpool certainly sets the bar higher for future comic book films. The character is fully utilized and is a direct translation from his comic book counter part.Ryan Reynolds does a superb job as the ""merc"" with a mouth and delivers on all aspects! Watch out Avengers there's a new hero in town and he ain't playing! A must watch for any person who wants a dark mature comic book hero.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"""Right up main street!""","Deadpool is a 2016 dark comedy action film with Ryan Reynolds playing the titular character, except no boundaries have been placed on him after 7 years of waiting.This film is wickedly crass, viscerally violent and pleasingly relentless to all of the fans that wait so long. What differentiates Deadpool to other films like it (Kick-Ass, Kingsman etc) is not it's superhero background, but it's comically cold driven narrative that has stood the test of time for almost 10 years.Deadpool himself is a man just wanting revenge and his girl, which sounds similar to other films like it but trust me it isn't. It's background characters never fail to add any awful presence as most of these chess pieces are only the pawns to the hilariousness of the Deadpool armada.If you don't like dark humour, stay away from this one, but overall for fans this modern work of comedic art this is a fresh air to breathe as Deadpool has most certainly carried his way through this path, with rather questionable motives....Grade: ADeadpool 2 tomorrow review.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Gold Standard in NSFW Content. Hilarious!,"Ecstatic to see Ryan Reynolds redeem his superhero aspirations, as this version of Deadpool was simply awesome. Apart from having actual speaking lines, this closer to the comics adaptation was laughably vulgar, profane & babbles incessantly. With a praiseworthy script, Reynold's delivery & light hearted charm, the result is a character that is from start to end hysterical & entertaining. This appeal as well, commands effortless chemistry with his just as compelling co-stars. The film's amusing tone is then never dependent on the anti-hero, as each character is given comical moments, & nails them impeccably.Apart from its headliners, Deadpool deserves acclaim for Marvel, & Tim Miller's boldness to put forth an R-rated superhero film that screams attitude from the get-go. Its over the top crudeness & propensity to poke fun at its own characters, its own flaws & even the entire genre, was a fresh & hilarious take, veering away from the usual origin story. Complimented by well shot action sequences, there is then no dull moment in this fast paced & relentlessly entertaining gem.As for its shortcomings, the use of CGI Colossus was one glaring eyesore. This annoyance dampens the character's action spectacles, given we've seen a fitting Daniel Cudmore effectively portray the character, although sparingly. Deadpool succumbs as well to the generic & far from stellar final showdown, its jokes weren't able to salvage. Perhaps its mismatched villain is reason for this?Nevertheless, Deadpool remains an entertainment gold of a film. Its NSFW antics carried out by an adoring cast plus its brand of violence, makes for one solid watch crammed with laugh out loud & joyous moments. Who needs a riveting plot anyway? 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Badass 'superhero' with the motormouth... You'll like him,"I've finally got round to watching this after keep getting told just how good this film is by so many. After the slew of comic book films, which just feels relentless, this was a kick up the back side to the whole genre. Not since Dredd has there been a comic book film which is for adults instead of the repeititive fare we are getting elsewhere.Deadpool is superhero who denies being one, and is totally unorthodox. Shunning all the morality of the standard hero, his name is known, he takes off his mask, he kills villians without remorse, he swears and break's the screens fourth wall. All with a cheeky and crude motormouth, this is a loveable rogue of an action hero.The action is violent but I really liked it, and really makes fun of the whole genre with quips all the way through.We have a bit of an origins story here to give us some background to the character, whom I never knew about before. He is simply the antithesis of the average comic book hero, and all the better for it here.Give it a try if you are ready for a bout of adult humour & violent comic fare. I was, and I liked it. Admittedly the quips could get tiresome in the length of a movie, but our hero is still funny throughout.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Deadpool,"""Deadpool"" can symbolize the beginning of a new age in cinema – a global dumbing down of the moviegoers with violence and vulgarism of this so-called satire on superhero films.The film received positive reviews both from the critics and the audiences alike what can raise doubts about authenticity of these reviews and about the intellectual level of these so-called critics.One thing I agree with is that the director is an ""overpaid tool"" as this is how he was credited in the titles.This film was supposed to be a parody of the superhero film, however the jokes are not funny and needlessly vulgar, and is targeted towards the most primitive audience.The plot is stupid and full of pointless violent scenes. There is no aesthetic value of cinematography, nothing emotionally gripping and the whole film is reminiscent of a bad joke played at the stupid audience who bought the ticket to such a trashy film.Somehow this film is a classic example of brainwashing of people, manipulating the most primitive instincts, appealing to the dark subconscious of the young and immature people. The film is too juvenile, however it has a R-rating so it is not really clear what audience it was made for.See more reviews at: http://indie-cinema.com/",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Executed to an incredible standard,"Deadpool (2016) is a movie that is 10 years in the making and it was worth the wait. Unlike other superhero movies of this nature, 'Deadpool' is unique in the way that it was able to hold its own despite having an enormous weight of expectation placed upon it. 'Deadpool' did not crumble under this pressure and I can honestly say that I can happily go through the rest of 2016 knowing that 'Deadpool' was a complete success in every sense of the word. Not only was use of breaking the fourth wall executed perfectly, it was done in just the right amount. The ""rated-R"" style of comedy and violence could not have worked better in any other movie and it is safe to say that Ryan Reynolds is as much Deadpool as he is himself. My only negative opinion on the movie is that it did not contain as many fight scenes or fight scenes of large scale that I would have liked, but in retrospect it did not harm the overall experience of the film.Thanks For Reading!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
amazing simply amazing,possibly my favorite comedy (no not super hero movie) of the year you don't need to be a comic book fan or love superhero movies to like this simply because its not a hero movie its a comedy and the best kind the way the comedy and forth wall breaking is done is just how you'd expect the way he looks at the camera every now and then makes you feel like your there in the movie and the comedy is so funny i think the whole cinema was laughing the whole way through. overall a great comedy and if your expecting a justice seeking crime fighter saving good people and arresting bad guys your in for a plesent surprise if your looking for a good action and anti hero comedy your going to be very impressed,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Boldness is its best feature, and the classic elements are its worst.","While not spectacular, the unconventional dialogue, the breaking of the fourth wall, and everything that makes Deadpool the most unconventional superhero are undoubtedly the best parts of the movie. It brings freshness, humor, and keeps the movie interesting. However, the traditional love story and the villain (a rather weak one, by the way) who endangers the girl are the least captivating aspects. I believe a more complex angle could have been taken to develop this part of the story.Another great creative aspect is the way the plot is told, moving forward and backward in time. The visual effects are quite good, and the music is fantastic. Overall, I'd rate it a 7.5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Funny and compelling but could have been better.,This film is a bit of hit and miss. The opening action sequences make you think it will be another boring action flick with lots of one-sided fights. It then delves into a humorous account of how the protagonist came to be and his mission that follows. It has some laugh out loud moments mixed with some absolutely cringe-worthy moments. It's surprisingly gory and the violence can be cliched. Reynolds does his best with the script put in front of him. Overall a fun watch and recommended if you haven't seen it yet!,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Funniest Comic Book Movie in a Long Time,"If there's one thing Deadpool does, it is entertaining the audience. It breaks the fourth wall constantly, which any how-to-write-a- screenplay book would surely suggest not to do as it defeats the illusion of the movie to do this. But this is not just any movie. This is Deadpool.Ryan Reynolds is the perfect choice of casting to play the titular character. His quip constantly hits the audience blow after blow to prove for a very likable superhero (though he wouldn't call himself a hero). He may be in the suit, but it is his voice acting which really captures the essence of Deadpool. You can undoubtedly hear the sarcasm or the attitude that comes with all of his one liners.The movie is balanced in the sense that it flips back and forth between chronology, rather than have all the exposition packed into the first half hour and follow the character on a linear path to him becoming the super human he becomes. Instead we have to ask questions as an audience, and Deadpool promises he will reveal the answers in flashbacks, or rather with inter-cutting within the film.Sadly, pretty much all of the cool action is revealed in the red band trailers of the film, which has us wanting more surprises which we never get. Overall, the film seems to only have 2 key action sequences on top of that, meaning this film is more about the origin story than it is about delivering theatrics, although that is probably the point since is the first Deadpool film (please let there be sequels!) Another disappointing aspect is the fact that the CGI for the character Colossus is not that great.Deadpool is a fun experience, and it will have you asking whether all the fourth-wall-breaking makes it a more enjoyable experience as a Marvel movie.3.0/4.0",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
it was quite nice,"I generally don't like these kinds of movies and TV series, I like cyberpunk/science fiction/mafia TV series and movies, but this movie was really good. Deadpool's story was also good, like the fight scenes, breaking the 4th wall at almost every moment, going back and forth at the right points, etc. What I think about the most is what it would be like if Deadpool's story was told in a much darker way, because the idea is very good and has potential. I will watch the sequel and Deadpool v Wolverine, after this movie I think they are much better, anyway, this movie definitely wins the 7.5/8 score.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Am I missing something ????,"I understand it's a Marvel Comic spawning and at Marvel almost anything goes. However what I don't understand is the obvious discrepancies in the various action sequences which somehow or other allows Deadpool/Wade to walk free from a whole host of life threatening nay impossible situations just so the story can continue unabated ?Is it thrilling ? Is it gripping ? Does it make me want to view the sequence ? Unfortunately I have to say No to all three questions.If, in future, the makers want to create a Marvel comic film which suspends all belief in the natural world and allows for all manner of ridiculous situations to exist as the hero continues on his merry way then why not try a cartoon film instead ?",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"A surreal, comedic and insane masterpiece","A sprinkle of 'Smart-Assery,' some very cool camera work and a wacky- overly comic book styled tone, the opening credits had me in awe. And the movie didn't let up these elements. It kept up with the feel from start to finish.This film was clearly a passion project and it shows, the people behind this film have a love for Deadpool, the fans that came to see it opening day have love for Deadpool, and now, the movie will introduce new people and welcome them to have love for Deadpool. Filled with clever meta-humour and wit. This is the definition of a Comic-Book movie; future Marvel and DC projects should pay attention here.The action is insanely fantastic. I sat there simply impressed by what they accomplished in a movie that at first, was probably considered something to not take seriously. But this film holds up just as well against the other Avengers films in terms of action and special effects. From over the top physics which result in goons and bad guys being taken out on a whim by The Merc with the Mouth himself (As well as a few X-men friends) to the comedic (As well as non-comedic) brutality present throughout. The movie isn't afraid to be violent, which is actually quite an amazing thing. Henchmen kicked and punched, sliced and diced, shot and blown up, and generally murdered in all sorts of creative ways throughout. Deadpool never restrains from violence – It Embraces it. Wilson is portrayed with quick-fire wit, a sense of silliness, but also a dark side. Wilson is quite a tragic character and the film should be praised for presenting this. The comedy behind Deadpool comes from misfortune and sadness, he is a tortured soul, a broken clown if you will. The characters' motivations are actually quite realistic, and we see that this is a determined character with purpose. This film is a revenge story and an action film as much as it is a superhero based comedy. And there are some real moments to feel for Deadpool. Which brings me to the love story, which I found to actually be quite compelling. There are certainly quite a few crass jokes here, there and in-between however to the core of the film Deadpool portrays genuine heart, and I think that's what really makes the film; Yes, it's a comedy, yes it's satirical of other superhero films and yes, it's wacky, but it's also a genuinely good film on its own. The movie never drags, at just under two hours, I wanted it to keep going! The pacing is absolutely perfect, never once slowing down too much or becoming dull or uninteresting. Deadpool holds your attention and makes you care, even when he is decapitating dudes left, right and centre. I do have one Subjective flaw that I should probably mention though. Some of the jokes just fall completely flat, and some feel like they're just being gross and tasteless simply for the sake of it and due to the film makers' freedom. Yes, the film gained its' (American) R rating, but relax! However, I went in expecting this, and most of it did its job well.Deadpool is a human being, rather than a cartoon, (Despite his personality.) The film was also so fast paced and quick cut that by the time one joke was said, another was about to be. And there was a fair share of fantastic jokes and humour throughout. The tone of the film and titular character was pretty spot on.The real great thing about the movie is that it portrays Deadpool correctly. At this point Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. Renyolds fits into his role as a superhero icon among Hugh Jackmans' Wolverine and Robert Downey Juniors' Ironman. His comedic timing, dedication to the role and faithful performance result in perfection. The other characters set in this oddly dark as well as cartoon like world come in forms of different relationships to Deadpool. There is his love interest, Venessa, whom matches Wilson's personality. She is much more of a normal person though, so it's toned down as she isn't a super human or anything, however the characters' compatibility is believable, as they are both wise-ass people who joke around with each other, have vague and unhappy pasts and both feel strongly for each other.Ajax, his nemesis of the film, who is played very straight. He is not an amazing character with lots of depth of personality, however he is what the film needs out of a villain, and gets the job done. You dislike him in the way that you are supposed to, and you do want to see Deadpool reign victory over him.Deadpool is a character that you root for, and a movie that you sit in astonishment at. Though at parts it may be silly, Deadpool never strives from admirable. You care about him as much as you laugh with him, and the film manages to maintain an extremely interesting and difficult balance. Deadpool is the definition of an unbalanced character, Deadpool could have easily gone wrong. The minds behind the film have earned a well-deserved praise. First time director Tim Miller knocked this one out of the park, as well as writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.The film is vibrant and energetic. It's pure fun and doesn't take itself too seriously, but manages to be able to when needed. The film is Stylish, and oddly (In a good way) Personal. It's deserving of praise, fast paced and anything but conventional. It's far from boring, funny and contains some really well done action and set pieces. I enjoyed it from start to finish, I finally got to see my hero done right on the big screen, and I very much look forward to future instalments involving Deadpool 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Ryan Renolds is just awesome, even though disfigured. Great sense of humor in hero's characterization is perfectly suited for the film. Fun is the word you would describe this film.

Deadpool has redeemed himself from the not so impressive X-Men origins,"From the witty one liners to the gory death scenes Deadpool is a movie that proves that comic book movies are still a must see. This movie not only redeems the character of Deadpool from the not so impressive X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie, it also introduces new characters like Negasonic Teenage Warhead (played by Brianna Hidebrand) and Weasel (played by T.J. Miller).From the minute I saw the opening credits I knew this movie wasn't going to be the typical superhero movie. The fact that the opening credits didn't actually credit anyone shows that this movie will be different. First of all the movie is structured differently compared to other superhero movies. Normally you have the origin story, then a problem of some sort, followed by a solution and ending on the big finale. This movie starts off introducing character but then almost immediately goes straight to a fight between the main characters with the origin story being shown in flashbacks. The movie constantly jumps between past and present which is a unique way of telling a story but still manages to work. Another thing that makes this movie different is that this is more of an anti hero movie then a superhero movie. Yes Deadpool fights bad guys but the fact that he kills all his enemies with extreme overkill suggests he is more anti hero then superhero.This movie does a lot of things that are good. If you like blood and gore then you will find the fight scenes very appealing. There are some clever jokes and a lot of references to other movies outside the marvel universe. Ryan Reynolds was the perfect actor to play Deadpool. If you're not a fan of Deadpool you will be after watching this movie and if you're already a fan of Deadpool then I can confidently say you will not be disappointed. The only real problems I have is that some of the visual effects look unrealistic but that's only because this isn't a big budget movie. Also the movie is short for a superhero movie being only 1 hour 48 minutes long. They should have made the movie at least 2 hours long.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Exactly what I would want from a Deadpool movie,"First of all I would like to start by saying that I was uneasy about this movie when I heard Ryan Reynolds was playing Deadpool. I was not really impressed by any of his superhero roles in the past, and bringing Deadpool is difficult to say the least . But thankfully I was so wrong about that, and Reynolds just proved that he was born for this.As for the movie, for the readers of the Marvel comics, there is not to much to say: it's the merc with a mouth in his beginnings. The movie will introduce some of the characters from the comics, while leaving some for the sequels. Maybe, from what I read, also for budget constraints. Also, we can make some assumptions on who will be the next villains based on the scene from the weapon X facility. There are a couple of minuses from my side: I would have like a few more X - men in the movie and also the insanity of the character is not fully exploited, but I hope that with the success of this movie the next one will have a bigger budget to include these things. I will not reduce the score for those though.For the non Marvel Universe readers, this movie is R rated for a reason. This movie is based on sex and violence. Also, I saw in previous that people had something about the 4th wall braking. This is one of the most important traits of the character, that he knows he is in a movie/comic and for our amusement. Please do not go to this movie if you are offended by nudity and F jokes, because you will hate every second of it, literally. And, if you decide to go to it, please do not take your child to it, hence R rate.This being said, for Deadpool fans, this is a must see movie. For other people, it will be a great movie if you are into pop culture and edgy jokes, otherwise, thread with care.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Perfect Comic Book Adaptation. And rated R for Humor not Gore,"Deadpool was an amazing Adaptation. They did a great job keeping the source material correct while adding the flair to this movie. Just to be clear there is a ton of gore in this movie but the reason it is rated R is for Deadpool's foul sense of humor. So all these other wanna be superhero movies that are changing their rating to R don't understand why it means nothing. The Extra gore was nice in Deadpool but it was not the reason I went to see it. But back to our show. It is really amazing that Ryan Reynolds can play anyone else, because it seems like he was born to play this role and that comfort ability he has with Deadpool is one of the reasons this movie is amazing. It is full of vulgar humor, silly off the cuff one liners and amazing action. It meandering plot line keeps this movie fun the whole way through. Also there is a great adaption of Colossus in this movie. If you into action and vulgar humor this movie is for you.

"A Hilarious, Fourth-Wall-Breaking Triumph","I gave Deadpool an 8, and honestly, there were very few moments where I wasn't laughing. This film delivered exactly what it promised-nonstop, unapologetic humor, brutal action, and a refreshing twist on the superhero genre. It didn't just break the fourth wall; it demolished it in the most charming and self-aware way possible, bringing the essence of the comic character to life in a way that felt effortless on screen.Ryan Reynolds is Deadpool-there's no other way to put it. His comedic timing, delivery, and sheer dedication to making the character as outrageous as possible made this film an absolute joy to watch. It took the standard superhero origin formula and flipped it on its head, injecting it with satire, absurdity, and just the right amount of heart.What makes Deadpool work so well is that it never takes itself too seriously, yet it's still incredibly well-crafted. The action sequences are sharp, the humor is relentless, and the self-awareness is chef's kiss.

After an hour of watching the film, I gave up on it and 80 minutes into the film I stopped watching the film. I completely lost interest in it and I got fed up with it. Although Ryan Reynolds really suits the role and was born to play Wade Wilson/Deadpool, the character was really annoying and he was a real pain in the ass and a bit of a knob.

There is lots of emotion in this. It is what causes Wade to do the things he does. It drives the story. A lot of the emotion is covered up by jokes so it doesn't hit as deep as it could.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 6/10
There isn't any big theme in this. The only thing I could really even think of is love. Because Wade does what he does for his love of Vanessa.This movie isn't very deep at all. I do like all the references and forth wall breaks it does. But there definitely could have been more.5. Characters - 9/10
All of the characters were potrayed great. I like how Deadpool feels like Deadpool. The villain just being insane also feels good. I just wish there was more of a tie to the X-Men films, with more X-Men characters. The ones that are in the movie are just kind of boring.6. Acting / Writing - 10/10
All of the acting was great. No complaints.7. Cinematography / Sets - 4/10
I was not a fan of the cinematography in this movie. I don't like all the slow-mo they use. And some of the camera shots are just stupid.8. Score / Sound - 4/10
I don't even remember the music in this movie. It was very bland and forgettable.9. Editing / Pace - 7/10
The editing was good.Pacing was fine for what the movie was. I just wish they didn't spend so long on flashbacks.10. VFX/Practical Effects - 7/10
The effects were good, but nothing great. Just good enough. Not perfect. But not terrible.Average Score:
6.7/10My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:
6.5/10
This movie was not worth the hype. It just was honestly pretty average. It's the type of movie you only watch once, and than never really think about again. But that one time you did watch it, it was pretty enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Well made in all aspects except for the comic malarkey,"I enjoyed this film, or comic book adaptation-if there's one thing I enjoy it's anti-heroes with moral ambiguity and just plain dark.The action was great, well shot, the story was even palatable.What wasn't palatable, believable, but contrived and cringeworthy was the to and fro sarcastic dialogue that came across as totally unnatural, scripted and obviously too fast paced.I don't care if this is sci fi or whatever genre it's supposed to be, this aspect ruined the ability of this viewer to accept the flow of the story.I'd go so far as to say it was so distracting and annoying as to almost ruin the entire experience.Everyone was raving about how exceptionally comically dark this was, except they must think rapid fire inappropriate self deprecating sarcasm was hilarious and suspended disbelief so far that they forgot these adaptations are supposed to contain gritty realism amongst the sci fi action.Nolan's Batman remains amongst the few (kick ass and chronicle also exceptional) comic book adaptation's that feel realistic and believable without compromising the characters or story.Still, we've gratefully come a long way from the camp tacky adaptations of the 90's and anything is better than that big budget drivel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A kids movie for adults,"I have never been a comic book guy, but the current cultural fixation on all things Marvel has made me curious as to what all the fuss is about.I'm no stranger to the style, and while I don't have the disdain for it that Ridley Scott does, I do find it too simplistic and predictable to draw me in all too often.Deadpool maintains a reputation as the black sheep in the MCU, and possibly the best candidate to sway the unconverted. It functions on two levels, simultaneously lampooning superhero tropes, while unabashedly revelling in them.This works best as the surface level action flick, even as it goes through all the expected hoops. I've always been a sucker for a good origin story, and since this is the primary focus, it keeps it from getting too bogged down with the endless bad-guy fights that can often sink these pictures.As the meta, anti-hero comedy, it often stumbles. While many of the self referential jokes enjoyably caught me off guard, Ryan Reynolds' try hard *ba dum tss* punchlines elicit a groan more often than a grin. Lines like ""Regina rhymes with fun"" make me picture the most annoying twelve year old I've ever met laughing his head off. And try as it does to include just enough sex, violence and swearing to justify it's edgy R rating, the target demographic is still that annoying twelve year old, and though I may be too cynical to fully laugh along with him, who am I to spoil his fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Fairly amusing action movie,"A newly-wed man submits to a shady medical program to cure his late-stage cancer. The torturous treatment works, but leaves him badly disfigured, and he feels unable to face his wife again. Can he get revenge on the man responsible for the torture and revive his relationship with his wife?It's a comedic action-drama. Naturally, with the jokes coming at rapid a rate, a lot of them aren't funny. A lot of the time it feels like the writer was trying too hard to make the jokes edgy, usually with blunt sexual reference. Still, some of them are funny. I like the ""I bet you're wondering how I got here"" trope.The romance is pretty satisfying, bad jokes and unconvincing kissing at the end aside. The action generally looks good.The villain's plan to deal with Deadpool is pretty stupid, but whatever.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A Kindly Processed Movie,"Note: Deadpool is a movie in which only a certain demographic of people an enjoy it. For that reason, I decided to bump it down a notch on my rating.Deadpool is a movie about a man named Wade Wilson who comes across a woman named Vanessa at bar/club. After they have been together for awhile after hooking up with her, he finds out he has cancer. One night at the bar, he gets offered a cure by signing up for the Weapon X Program which goes wrong once he finds out he's been baited in to joined a testing group of maniacs. This, along with many other procedures turns him into Deadpool, who now has super strength and regeneration powers. Deadpool is now on a search for the man who put him through this, AJAX and other of his accomplices.If you were expecting the original ""merc with a mouth"", your gonna get him with varying degrees of success. I genuinely enjoyed the movies humor, action, acting and sets, though however at the end, even though it might be parodying other superhero movies at the end, does get a bit bloated. Its a very funny movie that made me laugh a lot, especially the fight scenes.Some people may be a little turned off by the love story plot, but after awhile you get over it very quickly. I really think this an average movie at best. It did what it needed to do with average success and it should be commended for that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Fun and good fighting scenes, but that´s it.","This movie is really funny, but across from that I didn´t really like it, the plot is weird and the choices the characters do doesn´t always make since. The fighting scenes are good though. I think that there are too much sexual scenes at least for my likes and I wouldn´t watch it infront of my parents and it´s definitely a no no for kids under 15.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Hey, that's pretty funny","The Deadpool movie is a really funny and decent movie. But in my opinion, I did not find the movie to EXACTLY fit comic Deadpool.

A slick performance,"7.5
I anticipated finding this a bit of a eye-roller, but I honestly can't find much fault with this other than the fact that it wasn't entirely to my personal taste. It's slick, surprisingly funny, and quite rightly doesn't pull any punches. The casting is good - Reynolds is an excellent lead, and Ed Skrein really makes the best of what is unfortunately a rather dull villain character. The story is occasionally a bit thin, or just misses the mark slightly - possibly owing to the budget constraints, although these seem to have been approached creatively - and there is a tendency to slightly overdo the key elements of fourth-walling, quips, references etc. For my taste, it just missed a little something, but unusually for such a situation, I found myself really appreciating the way the film was put together. Frankly, it's a damn good piece of work, with enough invention to make it fresh without being cringey. It kept me guessing, I didn't look at the time once (always a good sign both of an engaging production and a good length), and I enjoyed myself a lot more than I expected to. Definitely happy to see more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Funny, original movie","I personally haven't seen many movies, so I wouldn't know... but this one seems pretty original. The main character keeps breaking the 4th wall and makes tons of good jokes (unlike cringy family movies). Also has good nice action sequences.Good comedy/action movie, a bit of originality, that's about it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"A fresh, if gratuituous, take on the genre","This film takes the risky idea of a wisecracking, R-rated, bloody superhero movie and turns it into a wild success. Exceeding all expectations, it led the way for other great movies like Logan and Joker. Why did this film do so well? Simple - it was a fresh take on the genre and showed how gritty and violent the world would be if superheroes really went around pursuing their personal grudges. The action scenes are brutal, the structure of the film playfully navigates through dramatic flashbacks and the tone is crude enough for its target audience. For me, the humour actually let it down, as the fourth wall breaking seemed gratuitous and the jokes were juvenile.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Your anti-anti superhero flick.,"Basically, the mind of an eighteen year old boy put to film. Clever, and deeply self-reflexive, this picture aims to reignite the spark of a well - worn genre by adding a little spice and a restricted rating. It mostly succeeds; Ryan Reynolds excels full-throtle as the wise acre accidental superhero. As an origin story it's all cookie cutter, but not cluttered and never dull. After former special forces op Wade Wilson meets the girl of his dreams, unexpected events shake the foundations of his life, causing him to seek vengeance as masked anti-hero Deadpool. It's not great, but it's sleek, fun entertainment delivered with a mile wide grin. A fun night at the movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One more superhero is in the market!,"Another mutant has been created by Marvel, called Deadpool. Because of the last stage of cancer, the hero, Wilson agrees to to an experiment which can survive him so that he can live a life with his love. But, experiment goes wrong and though he becomes a mutant but his skin becomes very ugly. So, he plans to find Francis who can solve the problem of his skin. But, Francis is also a mutant, so the battle between the hero and the villain begins. And this is the story of this film!Comedy is super cool. Film looks like a pure paisa-wasool masala. It has all double meaning dialogues, and in Hindi, they are just too good. We can feel that these are our own! Two X-Men characters are there, too. Not more, because of the producer's limited budget! Hehe!Very sharp editing and some scenes are fantastically made with the use of graphics. And don't forget to watch the teaser of the second part in the end, after the end credits. Believe me, it is really funny.So, one more superhero is in the market. This movie is creating records and collecting money. Sequels will be definitely made. Let's see how long will it go!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"The best Marvel movie so far. A comic book movie made for everyone, not just comic book fans. I wish more were like this.","""This is a different kind of superhero story."" Wade Wilson is a former Special Forces member who now works as a mercenary. He has the perfect girlfriend and everything is going his way. When he discovers he has cancer everything changes. When Wade is approached by a stranger with a way to cure him he takes the chance. It doesn't go as planned and now Wade has only one thing on his mind, revenge. If you have read any of my reviews before you will remember one thing, I am pretty much over the whole superhero movie trend. I am a huge Ryan Reynolds fan and this looked funny so I was looking forward to watching this one. This, to me, is hands down the best Marvel movie they have ever done. The movie is hilarious, very adult, and self aware, which I love. There are a ton of little inside jokes and the movie starts with maybe the best opening credits ever and ends with one of the best post credits scenes I have seen. Superhero movie fans will love this. Non-superhero fans (like me) will love this. This is just a fun movie that never really lets up. I just cannot recommend this enough. I loved it and my stomach hurt by the end of it. Overall, the best Marvel movie so far. A comic book movie made for everyone, not just comic book fans. I wish more were like this. I loved this movie. I give this an A+.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
