"Good, bloody fun!","I went into this film with expectations for an extreme amount of campy senseless gore and violence - and it was delivered as promised! A WARNING: Know what to expect when you go see this movie, or you might be surprised/disappointed. There is no moral, no good sense or life lesson to be taken from the story lines or characters. Sometimes things don't make sense and this is all done on purpose in homage to original exploitation films Warnings aside, Grindhouse is a lot of fun, there were as many ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" moments as there were ""oh my god why did they show that?"" moments. All of the actors' performances were right on and the action directing was excellent. My only negative comment is that Tarintino's film dragged a bit in the middle, but he more than made up for it. I couldn't help but raise my fist in the air and shout out ""yeah!"" at the end of his flick.You will be surprise, you will be disgusted and you'll enjoy the hell out of it.A unique cinema experience indeed.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"As uproariously funny, perversely disgusting and outrageously awesome as everyone hoped it would be","When I first heard about Grindhouse, I was pretty excited. I have enjoyed practically everything Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez have ever done, so the idea of such a nostalgic homage as Grindhouse really peaked my interest. I was really hyped for the movie, and managed to snag free passes to an advanced screening, and was it ever worth it.Grindhouse consists of two very different films. The first, Planet Terror, is directed by Rodriguez and is a horror movie about zombies. The second, Death Proof, is directed by Tarantino and is a thriller about a crazed killer who murders women with his car.Just knowing these two simple plot lines is enough. They are two stand alone films, and they are just as awesome as I thought they would be. This is the closest to a true homage that either director has ever done, and it works amazingly on screen. I was never a big on watching real grindhouse-style films, but these two films are exactly what I would expect them to be like. Just watching the films together was an experience that is simply unmatchable.I was not expecting anything more than an obscene amount of violence, but the films were a lot more than that. Despite some missing reels, both films have just enough story to actually make them work as conventional films. As said previously, they could easily stand alone away from each other, and still be just as good (but probably not as awesome as they are back-to-back). Having part of the films missing really does not even matter, they work that well without them, and have all the trademark carvings of a Rodriguez or Tarantino film. Planet Terror drags on a bit near the finale, but that seems only because Rodriguez tried to pack in a lot more story to offset the action than the premise really set out for it too. Death Proof is loaded with dialogue, but it comes off brisk and so much faster paced. But all the same, both stay very much in tone with their particular genre.The missing reels are only a complement to the fact that both of the film's actual picture quality is intentionally absolutely terrible. The films (more so Planet Terror) are scratched up and tarnished to the point where some scenes are practically unwatchable. You just stop seeing the action on screen, and only notice how beat up the print is. It looks old and worn out. And it works wonderfully, and makes the experience all the more authentic. The DVDs will not look anywhere near as stylistically worn as the films do here. Watching these films in perfect quality would just ruin the true homage-style the pair were going for.The violence in both is another key element to the true impact of both films. Both are quite obscenely violent, and just become downright disgusting in a lot of sequences. They set out to push the limits of conventional 2007 era violence, and they more than do that. People are decapitated, ripped limb from limb, and just shot left, right and center. These people are destroyed beyond all comprehension, and just when you think they have done enough, it just keeps coming. Gorehounds will be in heaven, and those who have trouble looking at more than the slightest hint of blood may need to sit this one out. It gets to the point of being sick and twisted, but it works beautifully in the films, and they just would not be the same without it. The makeup artists put in a lot of work here, and it shows in how graphically violent the films are.But by pushing it to the limits, the films also become darkly hilarious. It is not just the dialogue that will give you a chuckle, it is the effects and the action happening on screen. In some places, it just becomes so downright ridiculous that you cannot do anything but laugh. A lot of what happens is downright vile and inhumane, but it is done with such style and wit, that it just cannot be anything but hilarious. Every obscene and violent action done in previous Rodriguez and Tarantino movies is more than topped here, and fans will be hard set on not wanting some more by the time Death Proof concludes.The faux trailers are also a nice touch, and in a way, push the boundaries of violence and hilarity even more so. I do not want to ruin any of them, but I just could not stop laughing. They are absolutely perfect, and they connect the films even more than they are already (not to mention the old-school ratings and preview reels). Rodriguez's Machete trailer that opens Grindhouse is amazing, and sets the tone for everything that follows. They only further how dedicated the filmmakers were to their original visions, and make the film all the more authentic.The acting is campy, cheesy and right on the mark. Everyone is at their best, no matter how small their role, and no one feels like they are wrong for their part. Rose McGowan is a particular stand-out in both films, delivering every line and action to the highest degree possible. Kurt Russell is another stand-out, playing a character that is so evil that he exhales cool with every breath. And Freddy Rodriguez more than proves that he has what it takes to be a leading man. I did not like one particular character's sudden change half way through their film, but it works for the most part anyway.There is nothing more I can say but that you need to see this film. It may be imperfect and a bit longish, but it is the closest thing to a brilliant homage that any filmmaker or audience has ever seen. It is everything that anyone could have hoped for and more.9.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Go see it in the theater.,"I went to the premier in Austin last night. Wow, what an awesome event. Here are a few brief thoughts: One of the previews, that is being made into a movie, looks absolutely absurd and I am sure that it will be a joy to watch.Planet Terror kept you laughing, groaning, and cringing the entire time. Enough action to keep you into it, enough campy gore to laugh at, and plenty of build up to have you cheering for the good guys. Rodriguez put together an A-rated, B-movie.Death Proof was also enjoyable. I may have been antsy due to the cramped seating, but it seemed like there was a little lull in the middle. I didn't want to get up at intermission as I didn't want to miss the trailers. As Tarantino has done before, there is some great dialogue flying around the core group of actors.I will definitely go see it again in the theater. I missed some of the dialogue due to the roar of the audience. However, I think having an interactive audience really adds to the experience.Enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Best ""experience"" in years","I won tickets to the world premiere of Grindhouse in LA this past week and it was the best 3 hours of my life in recent history. The stories of the two movies combined with the detail and inventiveness of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez brought together 3 hours of action packed fun. The two directors updated the sleazy grindhouse movie experience from the 70's and commercialized it so that we can all enjoy it. You won't find some greasy guy with his pants around his ankles sitting next to you, but you are probably going to be able to sit through all 3 hours of these movies.I want to compliment the directors for having a unique cinematic vision (and the Weinsteins for funding that vision). I don't always agree with the choices made with either of the filmmakers, but I think they are two of the hardest working most innovative people in Hollywood today. I add this because most film studies students love to hate both of these people and in most conversations suggest that they would be able to do a much better job than either. I disagree.Planet terror is a gross out flick that has appropriate amounts of gore and guts. If you like Rodriguez, then this movie fits in with all of his previous works. No real surprises here, but fun fun fun!Tarantino surprised me. I liked the first movies from Tarantino because his movies were set in realities not far from our own. I doubt that it would happen in a weekend, but Pulp Fiction is a semi-believable good story in Los Angeles with unbelievable dialog. Same with Reservoir Dogs. (Jackie Brown is too believable and therefore, uninteresting) As he has progressed, his movies became fantasy, e.g., From Dusk til Dawn and Kill Bill 1 & 2 and WAY too over the top for a ""Tarantino"" flick.Death Proof brings it all home! I don't want to spoil any of the movie, so just go see it! It's a simple plot with unbelievable suspense and decent dialog. I have never been so nervous in a film in as long as I can remember. Its no secret that the movie involves a car -- but Tarantino has taken a ""classic"" car scenario using a classic car and updated it for the new millennium. One only has suspend belief ""just enough"" for this mix of reality and fantasy to suck them in. It was Tarantino at his best.Both movies were well executed, well scored, well written, and well played. The extra's and cameos are icing on the cake. No Oscars for either director, but that isn't why you went to see these movies in the first place, now is it?",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez... got to love them!,"What is there to say about Tarantino and Rodriguez except that they make some of the best dang movies ever! Grindhouse is a double feature made of Planet Terror and Death Proof, two of the best movies ever made, in my opinion.With nothing but blasts of good gory fun and catchy lines, and talk scenes, Grindhouse is a force to be reckoned with. These movies are spectacular examples of what ""bloody horror"", ""intense thriller"" and ""tongue-in-cheek comedy"" really are. Along with an excellent cast, these movies have amazing qualities that only true horror lovers would admire. Whether it's a machine gun-legged go go dancer, to a tricky plotting stuntman, you just have to absolutely love Grindhouse.As soon as I started watching Deathproof on DVD, I have to admit I thought it was boring and overrated. I watched it a few more times and I loved it more and more. You really get to appreciate all the girls and their great personalities, and find the movie more enticing and fun with every second.Now when I first watched Planet Terror... I fell head over heels for it IMMEDIATELY. Planet Terror was just so fantastically entertaining. You get great hilarity with both films, and Planet Terror gives cheesy action like never before. No matter if Grindhouse did bad at the box office just 'cause lazy people wouldn't get there sorry butts in there to see a marvelous four hour film and they wanted to see other stupid excuses for movies that were in theatres at the same time, Grindhouse is another astonishing piece of work from the masters Tarantino and Rodriguez.So remember, that you can only catch these stunning movies at, the Grindhouse.Planet Terror - 10/10, Death Proof - 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Most entertaining film I've seen in years.,"There was no doubt in my mind that Grindhouse would be awesome. Two great directors making back to back movies. All films paying homage to the old grindhouse films the two filmmakers grew up on. I have just returned from the advanced showing of the picture and will have to say I am completely satisfied with this great film, or should I say films. The audience was cracking up and cheering and it made the entire experience more memorable. This is the kind of film where I will always remember the first time I saw it. Rodriguez seems to have the most fun with his film Planet Terror. The film is Rodriguez's dream project that he has wanted to make since he was a teenager. Quintin seems to take his a little more serious, but delivers an original story with one of the most satisfying endings. 10/10 is the rating I give this film. I recommend this movies to anyone who is a lover of films.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The first classic of the new century,"Grindhouse is all about excess. Excess blood, gore, puss, explosions, near non-stop laughter and violence. The only thing you will find little of in it is nudity. It's typical Tarantino-paranoid-about-nudity and what we get are two distinct halves to one great film.If you loved Tarantino's ""Jackie Brown"", then you'll love ""Death Proof"". D.P. is basically Jackie Brown on wheels. He rambles on and on and on about completely un-funny and pointless things for nearly 50 minutes with little else happening. I am quite disappointed with QT, as he is my favourite director/writer but I think he is stretching his limit a bit too far. He has fallen into a self-indulgent groove of non-stop banter or over-the-top violence. The end is capped off with probably one THE BEST car chases in history that lasts for about 20 amazing minutes that will undoubtedly give you a heart attack it's so well made. Also, Kurt Russell is NOT the main star of it as many people believe and I'll leave it at that.Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" on the other hand is a completely off the wall, no holds barred shmorgassboard of absolute cinematic enjoyment. People blow up when shot with revolvers, gore is splattered at least every couple minutes once it gets past the first two minutes and it will have you laughing harder than any Tarantino film ever has. It is so freakin' good that I think my eyes fell out and had an orga*m due to the cinematic bliss that is ""Planet Terror"".Rose McGowan will undoubtedly become the new pin-up girl and sex symbol due to her role of Cherry Darling; a Go-Go dancer (unfortunately not a stripper) that eventually gets an assault rifle for a leg. Who knew that an assault rifle for a leg could ever be THAT hot?There are no words in the history of mankind that can help me explain to anyone the awesomeness that is displayed in ""Grindhouse"". ""Death Proof"" may drag it down a bit, but is nonetheless essential for the film as a whole. This is exactly the movie that Hollywood needed to have kicked up it's butt. Hopefully this will pave the way for more ""extreme"" films or higher rated films in general; although I'm still unsure if it would be a good idea to go to the extremes that French cinema is experiencing at the moment, but would nonetheless be welcome.IMO, ""Grindhouse"" is THE BEST FILM since ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" in 1966 for pure filmic enjoyment. Sit back, relax, and prepare to have your head explode! Go see it now or you'll regret it!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
2 and several fractions for the price of 1,"I feel the need to think and write about ""Grindhouse"" as one complete entity, because splitting up the distinct parts is like separating a head from the torso, arms and legs that let it rise up and chase whatever it feels threatened by. This wacko love letter to the less than elegant cinema experience is disgusting, exciting, uproarious and about a thousand other words I could type. I saw it twice in the spring of 2007 and would have went a few more times if it hadn't disappeared as quickly as it did. The tickets were worth every penny.The packed houses were rocking for three hours each time and I'm still annoyed more people didn't support the full ""Grindhouse"" package, as they could have done much worse in choosing a flick to go see that year. The only remedy I can propose is keep the budgets down and make two more features (this time from different directors), create some new trailers (including one each from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino) and market the heck out of this package deal, hoping there is a larger audience who are hipper to this trip the second time around. The flaw wasn't in the concept, it was with the youth crowd who should have been out there supporting a more bang for your buck venture.Rodriguez drops a great bomb of a tale (confirming my theory that a zombie movie always kicks the ass of a vampire movie!). His wild and wonderful ""Planet Terror"" is the great blending of several b-movie staples into one funny and vital alloy. Quentin gets his finest hour as an actor, revelling in the scum passing for human he plays for all it's worth. Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez and Josh Brolin each have meaty material to devour and the supporting cast (especially the crazy babysitter twins) all have the time of their lives.Complaining about Tarantino's dialogue or anything else that was a pet peeve of the ""Death Proof"" critics is missing the point. These characters hang out and shoot the breeze until it's time to shoot the enemy! Here, Kurt Russell gets a character just as rich (if not richer) than Snake Plissken and he makes the most of it. His one brick shy of a load stuntman is the kind of fringe player most people in film have met at some point and he gives the best performance of his career. And Zoe Bell gets my award for most insane physical performance by an actual stunt woman (how did they ever get insurance for her on this f$$king project?...didn't anyone read the script?!).My only complaint is Mary Winstead didn't get to belt out a few more numbers (hint, hint, Quentin...bring back Mary as Lee Montgomery in another project!). Maybe her character should have been a pop star who isn't a total studio gimmick, as her voice is far superior to most of the young ladies making a living as so called singers. Baby, it's her that deserved more screen time!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Tale of Two Movies,"Grindhouse(2007)Review 1: Planet Terror(2007) Welcome to the Grindhouse. We start off with an excellent and extremely funny ""trailer"". This is brilliant stuff. ""Machete."" You will laugh, you will enjoy the B-movie magic. This is filled to the top with cheese and including the silly voice-over to go. It's a hoot.Planet Terror is on. We see retro movie intros with the misspelled words and low budget sound. It's all so well done. Anyway, Planet Terror is the next wave of zombie horror. This movie delivers all the goods and then some. We get all kinds of extreme violence and B-movie humor. This movie takes it all the way with the violence! We also have a terrific cast. The story is actually pretty good.Michael Biehn is great as the Sheriff Hague. We also get Rose McGowan as a former stripper. The scenes at the hospital are incredible. When Quentin Tarantino shows up, this can be the most original zombie scene ever! It's grotesque, but you will be in total shock! The movie has an age feel to it and is treated well. We have the old looking film reel to the burnouts and missing scenes too.Planet Terror is an amazing tribute. This is one of the BEST zombie movies I have ever seen! Now for a treat. We get a few more rather hilarious and twisted movie trailers. Let me just say is that Eli Roth is twisted. These trailers are a hoot. Damn they are funny. Shlock value guaranteed. Be sure to look out for a surprise appearance that NOBODY will see coming! Now for the Tarantino.Death Proof(2007)Review 2: After an amazing first half we get a rather lackluster second. Hear me out, Kurt Russel is Stuntman Mike. He is homicidal and bad to the core. I found him to be one of the most likable villains ever. That's a plus. Also Death Proof has some unique kill sequences by Stuntman Mike that are well done and are satisfying. Russel is fantastic as the devil behind the wheel.However, Death Proof has many weaknesses. First is the inane and annoying girl-chat that goes on for what seems like an eternity. Worse yet, this has almost NOTHING to do with the movie! Second, the film does not have the old feel of the previous movie. Third, the heroines of the movie are just plain annoying. I, for the life of me got bored and frustrated with the girl chat and could not root for these girls. The second batch of girls were incredibly annoying.This is too bad as Death Proof has some really well done stunt work and a nice car chase scene. The revenge chase was lame though, due to the driver constantly cursing trying to be a bad ass at every conceivable moment to the point of hideous. Tarantino should have given Russel A lot more screen time as Stuntman Mike and less to the ladies. I found myself rooting for Stuntman Mike. I felt the ending was well.....unsatisfying is an overstatement. I felt ripped off.So, we got a tale of two movies. One a success and the other a massive letdown, despite a few cool scenes. This is a fitting tribute to the days long past, but Tarantino just did not deliver.The Last Word: Stay for Planet Terror and the trailers. Death Proof start off right, but hits a crash landing. Watching Death Proof is for the VERY patient. Trust me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant Filmaking!,"I absolutely love Tarantino and Rodriguez so needless to say this might be a bit bias but here it is: this film was amazing! I loved it from top to bottom. The characters were perfect and the plots were extremely interesting and visually impressive. This movie fully encompassed the true spirit of the Grindhouse genre and if these types of movies are your thing you will not be disappointed. Not to mention the trailers. They were hilarious and ridiculous all at the same time. Although the movie was a long one, you will have no problem sitting through over three hours of nonstop gore, violence some of the best car chase scenes I have ever seen and an all-star cast (including a few surprises I won't ruin for you) that just adds to the fun. GO SEE THIS MOVIE IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Masterpiece Throwback,"Grindhouse (2007)**** (out of 4)Sure, these movies are far from a real grindhouse but you're not going to have a better time inside a theater. With the fake trailers, messed up prints and bloody action, this movie is unlike any other ever made and that can only mean fun.Planet Terror Robert Rodriguez's horror film about a chemical outbreak, which turns the citizens of a small Texas town into zombies. The only thing standing in the way of the zombies going worldwide is a one-legged stripper (Rose McGowan) and her sharpshooting boyfriend (Freddy Rodriquez). This throwback to the low budget shockers of the 1970's hits all the right marks and also turns out to be the goriest film I've ever seen. How in the world this got away with an R-rating is a mystery to me because this thing is non-stop gore from start to finish and we're not talking about little spots of the red stuff here and there. Each single death (out of hundreds) has tons of the red stuff through heads being ripped off to zombies munching on some flesh. McGowan is the perfect ""B"" actress to make her role very memorable and goddamn was it nice seeing Jeff Fahey once again. Tom Savini, Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin and various others fill out the cast. The ""grindhouse"" effect of a cut up print with scratches and missing reels are used perfectly here. There's some humor throughout but the politically incorrect joke of a kid playing with a gun was a real hoot. Rodriquez fills the film with countless ""bad"" moments in great homage to the films this is trying to be like. If you're a fan of this type of thing then you'll love it. Others beware.Death Proof Quentin Tarantino's homage to those car chase movies features Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike, a psychopath who loves to stalk women in his death proof car. The girls, including Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd, Tracie Thomas, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, stunt woman Zoe Bell and Rose McGowan (again) are all perfectly cast and really nail Tarantino's dialogue but the real star here is the terrific return to form of Russell. Russell wasn't the first choice by the director but damn was he a great one. Russell just has that perfect smile and twisted laugh to make this psychopath so charming that you'd like to have a beer with him even though you know he'd probably kill you afterwards. Russell nails all the right marks making Stuntman Mike live right up there with Snake Plissken. This film is certainly a lot different than the first. This film takes its time in getting to know the female characters and I think this pays off in the end. Tarantino does a great job referencing other pictures so this will add some charm to die hard fans of the genre. Then there's the incredible chase at the end, which has to go down as one of the greatest ever. The chase is incredibly thrilling but it's also just a lot of fun. Seeing the girls being tortured by the ""always having fun"" Stuntman Mike was just a terrific time at the movies. I won't spoil anything but when the girl's seek revenge it's something that will make you want to cheer in laughter. Once again, if you're a fan then you'll love it but others beware.",,Anonymous,Horror
Hilarious exploitation nostalgia,"Grindhouse (2007) directed by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino is simply a very unapologetic exploitation homage.Grindhouse exemplifies its homage to exploitation B-movie thrillers, combining two feature-length segments into one double-bill designed to replicate the grind house theatergoing experience of the 70s and 80s. In ""Death Proof,"" a psycho named Stuntman Mike stalks and kills beautiful women with his car. In ""Planet Terror,"" a small-town sheriffs' department has to deal with an outbreak of murderous, infected people called ""sickos."" A gun-legged woman named Cherry and her martial arts-wielding partner take on the zombie army. Best of all, the two films were hilariouly fused together by fake movie trailers.Particularly, Rodriguez's Planet Terror is a fun and well thought out premise, delivering both humour, splatter, and lots of action. Contrarily, Tarantino's Death Proof does not reach the heights but is still a worthy B-side to Grindhouse.Recommended for its humour and homage to its nostalgic roots, but not for its originality or artistic integrity or nuance.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great trashy&campy fun,"The idea of the movie is to make a homage/parody of B movies and recreate a distilled grind-house experience, with an oversized budget, A-list star cast and by two top directors, resources that none of the trashy genre movies had. It is a work of love and a guilty pleasure to watch, though the first part, Planet Terror, is much more successful and would rate 9+, while the Tarantino entry is somewhat of a miss. The fake trailers, the first of which resulted in an eventual feature - Machete, are great.Planet Terror is the very definition of camp, and its only (slight) flaw is how obvious and in-your-face that campiness actually is. This part is action filled, and works perfectly as great, over-the-top, always hilariously fun, gory cheesecake. The second part is slower and somewhat different in tone, and is perhaps better viewed separately, it has its moments but Planet Terror is the superior part.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Slightly disappointed, though expectations we're admittedly very high","Well kids, the Grindhouse has finally arrived, in all of it's blood-soaked, cuss-filled, vulgar glory. Does this duo of grimy flicks deliver on it's promise at offering a different type of entertainment for the modern day mainstream? Absolutely. Do the combined films form an entirely new experience, the likes a younger generation have never felt before..Not really. Though none shall come as close to bringing one back to the glory days of cheap, exploitative drive-thru style fare as the indomitable pairing of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino continues to show, the ambitious throwback to trash cinema is not without it's share of setbacks, chiefly residing with the overall creative indulgences both director's take while attempting to emulate each of their esteemed homage's to underground forms.Starting off appropriately enough (including the first of much touted fake-though not for long- trailers, which work with rousing success), Rodriguez's convoluted but fun zombie disaster piece seems to take it's inspirations a little more literally then it's successor. Planet Terror manages to squeeze in so many Grindhouse features that eventually one gets the feeling that Tarantino will be trying an altogether different approach. Packed with more titillating gore and slimy action then anything he has done since From Dusk Til Dawn, Rodriguez perhaps borrows a little too closely from his cult hit of over ten years ago to portray the gruesome but never grim battle a dwindling number of residents must put up against an increasing number of poisoned undead. Showcasing some of the fantastic make-up effects that made Dusk such a guilty pleasure, Tom Savini's extended cameo surely factors into all the gore this half of the feature provides. An excellently dated score, composed by one-man-creative-team Rodriguez himself, lends perfectly to the older feel of the film and cannot be credited enough in finding a memorably familiar voice for the inhabitants of Planet Terror to dwell about. In the end, this first half of a double feature provides all the traditionalistic toppings one would come into Grindhouse expecting. Highlighted by some explosively sexy action sequencing (of course prominently advertised with Rose McGowan's leg-shooting antics), Planet Terror cuts out just as it is about to overstay it's welcome with a wild if predictable conclusion.Following with three more artificial movie trailers, guest director's Eli Roth, Edgar Wright and Rob Zombie wisely use the few minutes they are given to provide some explosive comedic relief while indulging their b-movie fetishes. Complete with phony advertisements for Mexican cuisine, this five minute wannabe intermission serves as an interesting divider and fun way to help the audience take a breather but ultimately does not escape the pompous construct that it is. It seems a loyal dedication to the audio and visual characteristics that made these 1970 style film's such pleasant memories for these warped film-makers ends up feeling like it's chief pretentiousness. While it remains cool throughout to see Rodriguez and Tarantino emulate the old days by adding dirt, dust, missing frames, poor edits, and an overall muddied production to the two tales, often these indulgences seem to be less about the style of the film and more about hiding a distinct lack of storytelling or personality these writer's should be articulating instead of shunning.This becomes no more apparent then after a few minutes into Tarantino's Death Proof, which from the very beginning employs too many cheaply edited pot-shots that do nothing but gently condescend the viewer with it's misleading mystique. I'm all for the style they are striving for and the cool conceptual gambles they took here, so long as they are not purposely, and repeatedly taunting their audience with the clunky editing, which by and large it feels like. Thankfully it seems Tarantino got most of these unnecessary quirks out quickly into his movie so he can concentrate on what he does best...or not. Largely the Yang to Planet Terror's Yin, Death Proof is a highly indulgent, dialog driven moody revenge piece. A far cry from the fun, fast pace of movie number 1, Tarantino's extended conversations centering around a group of (not so) bad-ass females may leave many of the director's fans expecting more. Though largely redeemed by a powerful climax and ridiculously entertaining final shot, the majority of this bloated short finds the once profoundly relevant screenwriter at his mediocre best, spending an inordinate amount of time concentrating on the weak exchanges between a group of women Tarantino obviously thought were cooler then the final product dictated. As we watch a pseudo-edgy female cast talk through an unnecessary amount of Pulp Fiction-like banter that refuses to engage the crowd, most non-visceral tension is largely squandered by the writer's inability to further Stuntman Mike's (a refreshed and rockin' Kurt Russell) characterization which leads to a spectacularly filmed, though psychologically unfulfilled car chase finale. Though the fragmented Death Proof feels underdeveloped and even lazy at times, Tarantino will never have a lack of tricks up his sleeve to completely sink the piece into boredom. Alas, when the ego-maniacal director is not busy indulging some irrelevant fetish of his, Death Proof is a taut, eerie film that makes good on it's deal to shoot some of the most harrowing car sequences of the past few decades.Anyone not directly investing multiple sleepless nights of fanboy devotion in anticipation to the B-movie double feature spectacle should not feel shortchanged despite all the problems I have noted above. An overabundance of hype in two of our generation's more conceptually ambitious auteurs has somehow wounded this overwhelmingly fearless piece of work, and though it may fall short of some expectations, Grindhouse chiefly delivers all the hell-raising, flesh-chopping, chick-watching, tire-screeching goodies it had promised. Viewers are treated to plenty of ""I can't believe they are showing that on screen"" moments, but the cumulative effect unfortunately does not add up to the transcendent crowd-bonding experience I was led to believe should happen.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tarantino is the Stravinsky of Movies,"Tarantino's critics do not seem to fully understand what he is up to. More than ""making movies"" he ""makes movies about movies"", in this case the B-movie genre.This is what Igor Stravinsky did with music. He would take some genre(baroque, 12 tonal or even jazz music), break it down into the essence of its component parts and then put them back together in different ways. What you got was no longer baroque, 12 tonal or jazz. It made you stop to wonder what those styles really were and why they appealed or didn't appeal to you.In a way, Tarantino is doing the same thing. He's making us question why we go to these movies and what the process of watching a film is all about. As a result it is not fair to criticize him because ""the girls should have just stopped the car"". In B-movies the girls just don't stop the car! It's like criticizing a serious drama for not having enough good jokes. He has really captured something about why these movies get audiences and are such intense fun to watch.Now that Tarantino has dabbled with films about B-movies, kung-fu movies,action movies,revenge movies, etc. it will be interesting to see if he can extend into other genres. Will we ever see a Tarantino musical, serious drama, love story or western?",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good and Evil,"I'm commenting on the double feature version of this rather than the separate films. I do have quite separate impressions of these but I do believe that the original intent was that they be seen together, and with all the interstitial matter.When you approach films from certain filmmakers, you do it on a basis of trust. Its a matter of how willing you are to allow yourself to be.Rodriguez has never betrayed my trust, so each time I encounter him, I am willing to play the game by his rules. That allows me to take more chances about the balances he chooses to make. Its a matter of yielding in the collaboration, so when he makes a cinematic joke or comment, I don't fight it. Trust.In this case, its sharpened by this phenomenon I notice a lot: he's directing a lover. It is obvious of course, but even if it weren't, it drives him to make ever stronger chances, on the edge of his emotional horizon.I think these two factors would make me like what he has done here regardless of all other factors. I do see the interior nature of the cinematic world. I do settle into the thick web of narrative threads. I do cheer when his love kicks ass.But the opposite is the case with Quentin. I cannot trust him. It isn't just because he's made some bad films. Its because he sets himself aside. He doesn't include the viewer: he preaches. All of the cinematic effects are delivered as monologues not as a collaboration. So we are never in on the joke, never in on extending the nature of the world.So I truly disliked his film. Sure, there's an empowerment story, and a sort of male's view of female bonding. But its all from the outside: the current of fate, the access to the group, the folding of all the principle characters being in the movie business. The actual camera-work of the stunts is from a discrete viewer, where Rodriguez puts the camera jumping around in the midst of the action and the emotional space.Both films play with the joke of what constitutes good and evil. But they themselves represent this as well.I will give Rodriguez a 3 and Tarantino a 1, but having Tarantino to have to go through increases the value of Rodriguez' effort. Bless him. I hope he does well with this woman.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Two parts amazing, One part lame","Moviegoers are always looking for something different--especially in an age of remakes and sequels--and when it came out that Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarrantino were working together on a throw-back double feature which would capture the feeling of grindhouse cinema people were curious, especially fans of the two directors.Although it will be considered a flop and future projects of this type may be put on hold or axed, ""Grindhouse"" starts strong with tons of attitude but seems to come to a dead stop about two-thirds the way through.The film's opener, ""Planet Terror"" is by far the superior film. It's a simple horror film that has an abundance of atmosphere, multi-dimensional characters and a quick, thrilling pace. Everything is over-the-top, but it's in this completely gritty and unrealistic world that's where all the fun lies. It plays with the audience's expectations and delivers an experience that demands attention.An unusual but welcomed addition to the film is the inclusion of faux film trailers. Each trailer mocks a convention of the horror genre with hilarious and, often, repulsing results. Some are a bit self-indulgent, but in the context of the film do add to the grindhouse motif.It is Tarantino's submission, ""Death Proof"" that brings the film to a dead halt. Tarantino has become far too comfortable in his own success and is at the point where he feels he can do no wrong. This film proves otherwise. From start to finish, ""Death Proof"" is a bore, lacking the flavorful dialogue and witty situations Tarantino's films usually contain. We are given about 15 minutes of senseless car chasing to combat the 45 minutes of girl talk, which might have well been written by a sorority girl. It doesn't help his film that it also follows about 2 hours of in-your-face action and violence. Tarantino should have rethought his portion of the film.For whatever reason ""Grindhouse"" as a whole flopped (its not wholly Tarantino's film). Perhaps it was the Good Friday release or the fact that a good portion of the film's targeted audience is too young to buy a ticket to an Rated R film on their own or that the generation that once enjoyed these romps has grown out of it. However, this film, or at least the first two hours are entirely entertaining. You may choose to watch Tarantino's effort, but Rodriguez's film as well as the off-the-wall trailers are complete enough to enjoy on their own. It's a shame that something this different didn't do well, as it will discourage future attempts.As it stands, ""Grindhouse"" rates a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too referential; too long,"First, it was too long. My bladder was too insistent and I had to leave in the middle. I hate that. I usually adjust my liquid intake to avoid any interruption. Three hours plus, without an intermission, is too long. I'm sure the length of the movie turned people off. Second, the plot of the ""Planet Terror"" sequence was nonsensical. I know it was meant to emulate the plots of the type of movie that was shown in the grindhouses in the 1970's but they were lousy movies to begin with. I got the reference five minutes after it started then I was pretty bored for the rest of the movie. It was not a very good movie. A homage not only references the parent material but it has to be entertaining for itself. ""Planet Terror"" was not entertaining enough for me. If I had watched that movie at home I would probably had been reading at the same time. There's not enough there to keep your interest. OK another zombie gets blown away, big deal. There was lots of action and hot babes but not much else. ""Death Proof"" was a much better movie. The references were there but the movie stood up by itself. There was the obligatory missing reel, an over told joke, that really didn't detract from the story much, and the Tarantino touches like the extended dialogs and the cursing. I found the dialogs, with the cursing, to be a bit over the top. I thought the information imparted by the dialog meant little to the plot and that the dialog was just a stylistic flourish, too much of a flourish. The beginning of the story was a bit slow. Luckily there were enough hot babes to sustain one's interest until the action started. The action was great. Zoe Bell was okay as an actress but as an action star she was great. The car chase scenes were nicely done. It just seems so satisfying to see vintage muscle cars in a car chase being wrecked. The acting was decent and there were a multitude of good performances. Rose McGowan looked better in ""Planet Terror"", maybe it was the stump. Overall ""Grindhouse"" was an OK movie. ""Planet Terror"" could be improved by missing a couple more reels. Its plot is just repetition anyway. ""Death Proof"" was a much better sequence. I think it needed more plot and less characters. I have to get involved with the characters and care what happens to them. With multiple characters I cared more for the Dodge Challenger than the drivers. Kurt Russell was despicable enough to want to see him get his comeuppance but the women, the many women, were too interchangeable to care about. Maybe it was meant to be referential but I thought the women characters, at least the first bunch of women in ""Death Proof"", were nothing more than sexual poster girls to sustain your interest until something else happened. The turn around in the second half of ""Death Proof"" was refreshing. I enjoy strong women characters in movies, like Pam Grier in Tarantino's ""Jackie Brown"". Too bad Hollywood just churns out hot babe movies. I guess the supply of young women willing to be exploited is endless.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This Should Really Be Called ""Planet Terror""","Robert Rodriguez does all the heavy lifting in this duology, where Quentin Tarantino seems to force out as much as he can into Death Proof, which is boring and slow. Planet Terror is the polar opposite, offering nods and winks at the camera with meta-jokes filtered in as well that anyone familiar with the inspiration for this double-screening are accustomed to, such as missing real footage, accidental film breakages, and lots of over-exposed footage. That is not to say that there is no over-arching story or action, of which there is excess, and exaggerated to the extreme.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Rodriguez delivers, Tarantino needs to come down from his cloud","Arguably, the appeal of a gimmick such as billing two films together to imitate the style of the grindhouse B-movies of the 70's is twofold: 1. Enjoy the rarefied characteristics of B-movies, held up to the artistic microscope and re-examined for ironic value, parodic value, and super-conscious manipulation of the elements of these films, and 2. Giving audiences two films for the price of one, real-feeling trailers and cinematographic conceits designed to revel in this fun and responsible atavism. Rodriguez delivers. His film is richly entertaining, suspenseful, action-packed and knows when to discard of characters, never betraying the ironic detachment from creative empathy, quoting the style elegantly. It is a film that does the job of creating a purposely bad film that ends up being good for parodic reasons. Quentin Tarantino is obviously a director usually delegated to a higher echelon of film-making. One of the best best, maybe best 10 directors in the world. One can imagine that the Rodriguez film is an appetizer for a genre-subversion alike the genius of Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill. And yet his film is absolute crap. No, it's not so bad that it's good. And no, it's not so good that it doesn't feel like a b-movie. It's so bad that it's...bad. The only thing even closely resembling a cohesive device is allusion to his own foot fetish, with foot-heavy framings and foot-infused conversations applied wherever possible. Where QT had a chance to transcend the ironic appreciation of the B-movie, (ideas: playing with the missing film reel segments, making on-purpose/accidental allusions to the first film, mimicking his own films or famous films in satiric way, using double meanings or double entendre's in campy deliveries, playing with audience a priori knowledge) he does NONE of these. It's as if in writing this film, he kept telling himself, ""No, Quentin, it's supposed to be bad."" Either that or the Hollywood glitter has completely gone to his head. I think good directors are allowed to make mistakes, but when it's because they're pretentious, they need to me admonished. Instead, plenty of reviews even claim that Death Proof is better than Planet Terror. These are written by pretentious morons that would fellate QT if he made a spin off of Pluto Nash. They have no understanding of human nature, no true sense of humor, by extension for this film: no understanding of hollow story, hollow structure, one-dimensional characters, mundane and drawn-out dialogue. It's disappointing to think that critics have a handle on good and bad films, and then watch them perpetuate QT's ego instead of forcing him to reevaluate himself, with the favored end of making more genius films.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
prepare to go home early,"Robert Rodriguez ""Planet Terror"" is one of the most outrageous and entertaining films I have ever seen in the theater! The audience was screaming and yelling and it is hard to believe that so many great things can be included in one film! The best example of a film with this level of escapism and joy is Peter Jackson's BRAINDEAD. Mr. Rodriguez clearly understands the appeal and fun of Grindhouse-type films and how to make one that succeeds and surpasses all expectations. Clearly, both director's enjoy these kinds of films but, only Rodriguez was able to reproduce one.Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" is a complete failure in almost every way possible! It is pretentious and boring and, it relies on one or two very lame gimmicks. While ""Terror"" offers an untold amount of highlights, this borefest barely offers two! He even forgets his own technique in that he uses the ""scratch, break"" gags in a poorly realized way and then finally just gives up on them completely towards the end. As a short film, it might have passed as a decent diversion at best. You'll be smiling as it starts (with a clever re-title joke) but then, slowly, you realize you've been had.Tarantino has made some truly enjoyable films that have become culturally significant and stand the test of time. This is without question his worst offering and, if not for being attached to ""Planet Terror"", would be almost immediately forgotten.So, head to the theater ASAP and bask in the joy's of ""Planet Terror"", wait for the trailers after, and then walk out. You will have experienced the purest entertainment that a movie can possibly offer!My rating of 7 reflects the greatness of ""Planet Terror"" and the boredom after that. Obviously, if ""Planet Terror"" was shown as a single film, it would be a 10. Clearly, there will be a great difference of opinion as to which film is best but, the crowd at my screening was mostly subdued and silent during ""Death Proof"" but cheered everything else.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
law suit?,"The score for the glorious Thanksgiving segment is credited to a Nathan Barr, but it's lifted from John Harrison's Creepshow. Harrison's score is very distinctive, and I have to wonder if he's getting credit and the $ he deserves. I remember that Tarantino showed off his cinephile referencing skills in quoting an extraordinarily area Bernard Herrmann cue from Twisted Nerve for Kill Bill Vol. 1, but he gives credit to Herrmann. Not so here. I wonder if that's part of the in-joke for cinema nerds like myself. Are they committing copyright infringement ""on purpose"" to give the appearance of grindhouse dine and dash production ethics? Certainly, a lot of these exploitation films to which this film plays homage ripped off scores (esp. Herrmann) and their distribution was slim and their audience not clued in. But this ain't no low budget toss off. I'd want my check.",,Anonymous,Horror
Takes me back!,"I thought this was a great movie,great idea..just an awesome tribute to 70's horror and exploitation films. I can remember the opening music of the previews..same music used throughout the 70's and early 80's in theaters across the land. Tarantino,who had slipped a little in my opinion,roars back with a vengeance! Rodriquez and Tarantino are an awesome cant miss combination. I just hope that Tarantino doesn't do anymore of the martial arts flicks. I didn't care for his last couple of films,but,at his best..he is unbeatable. I would love to see Oliver Stone in a collaboration with these two...what a movie that would be. I think most fans of 70's horror(even the cheesy horror)and exploitation films will not leave Grindhouse without being fully entertained.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good but not Great.,"I need to start out by saying I have a huge ""man crush"" on both of these directors. Even when they miss the mark, Once upon a time in Mexico & Four Rooms, they're still entertaining. Therefore, I went into Grindhouse with high expectations.If I were to break the film into 3 parts, and I have, I would grade them thusly:1. Planet Terror - 8/10 - I felt RR really nailed his movie and made a very entertaining and fun film. I even enjoyed the Missing Reel gag that leads up to the 3rd act of his movie. I also felt all of the actors got what he was going for and seemed to really enjoy themselves.2. The intermission trailers and other misc. goodies. - 9/10 - The trailers, title cards, advertising, and rating trailers were all dead on. I was laughing out loud and grinning like a fool through all of those particular parts. They really added to the vibe of the movie and brought back a ton of great memories.3. Death Proof - 5.5/10 - This is were things take a turn for the worse. I'm not really sure what QT was going for in the first half of his movie, but whatever it was, he missed. The setup was tedious and exhausting, and when things start to pick up with the introduction of Stuntman Mike, he goes and kills the momentum by setting up another group of heroes/victims. I really wanted to like this movie but I just couldn't get past the boring dialogue that failed to move the movie along or make us care about the characters. If he were to re-cut the film and take out all of the unneeded time with the first group of ladies, he'd have a pretty good movie on his hands. I will say the last 30 minutes or so, are incredible. The stunts and camera work are first rate and really had me glued to the screen. I would love to give his movie a better score and hopefully I will get a chance to when it comes out on DVD, but as is, this is his most disappointing film.Please take this review with a grain of salt. As you can see by my screen name, I have questionable taste in films, but I will say that I love great films as much as I love the bad ones. This one is closer to the great side (as a whole) than to the dark side, which should be good news for the fans of the directors.Enjoy and I'll see you at the movies....or the $5.00 bin at Wal-Mart.Bollfan1",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Watch Planet Terror, then walk out before Death Proof","Loved Rodriguez's Planet Terror, but hated Tarantino's pile of crap. Tarantino has somehow gotten under the delusion that his dialog is so great that he can make us watch a 100 minutes of it. I think I'll call this Kevin-Smith-itis.I'd recommend leaving during the opening credits of Death Proof.Planet Terror, on the other hand, was brilliant. I'm not sure I liked the scratches etc. on the print, but I can appreciate the effect of it. Planet Terror was the best comedic gorefest I've ever seen. Definitely the best movie of the year so far.Planet TerrorisAwesome!The trailers were also good, especially Machete",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rodriguez = Homage / Tarantino = Art Piece,"If you are a fan of both of types of film described above, then you will be satisfied. Both are done very well. But the Tarantino part is far less an homage to the scratchy Drive-in exploitation films you used to sneak to into as a kid. Terror Planet - the Rodriguez part - masterfully uses the elements of bad projection and jump cuts to add to the horror of this dark zombie flick. No question Rodriguez is at the top of his game, using all the nuances that go along with low budget horror films to heighten the entertainment. There is not one shot that doesn't represent an existing convention that began with the 70's genre. Even the absent-minded plot holes are gleefully butchered (why do cop cars just blow-up for no reason?). But far beyond loving homage, this is a well paced action film that visits all the facets of the genre in one great set piece after another. Josh Brolin is a standout in casting as a picture perfect B movie star, who nevertheless is an engaging character.For the second part, Tarantino pays far less attention to the technical elements of classic Drive-in movies. Instead, it is two sets of conversation pieces involving two sets of outgoing women. No doubt, Tarantino is very original when writing dialogue, that is definitely his strength. But after the rousing first half, I found myself yawning as Tarantino's wordy dialogue played out in real time. Whereas Rodriguez used jump cuts to speed through parts of the zombie tale, we 'grind' to a near halt as we sit around in a bar as hip chicks engage in girl-talk. Kurt Russell, the designated villain, has little depth. Then there is a second set of talky chicks who drop references to ""Vanishing Point"" and ""Dirty Larry and Crazy Mary"", as they have a showdown with Kurt Russell. Too much time is spent in adoration of the genre and the cars, instead of engaging in it. Indeed, by the second half of Tarantino's film, all the technical defects (scratches, jump cuts, etc), have completely disappeared. I found myself wondering if the big car chase and payoff at the end was worth the talky beginning 2/3 of the movie.Hey, I dig Tarantino sometimes, like ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Kill Bill 1 & 2"". But I think sometimes he wallows too much in his own Tarantino-isms. This is the case with ""Death Proof"". If this is supposed to be a movie about people who are thrill seekers in nice old muscle cars, then how about an action movie featuring those cars instead of long scenes of just talking about them. However, if you look at the Ying Yang of this double feature, perhaps it is a good counter to Rodriguez' fast paced piece with a slow paced character piece. But you better be in the mood for it, honey, because you are in for the long ride with the girls, and it takes a while to get to the action. I can't say it was not well done, Tarantino deserves credit for his contribution, but I came for pulp exploitation, not for chit- chat.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Two Movies For The Price Of One,"This was an amazing double feature film, this was the one film that America has just waited for. Now Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez have finally made their best movie and they were working together. They made other great movies like Sin City, Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, From Dusk Till Dawn, and Once Upon A Time In Mexico. But Grindhouse will be the greatest hit of their movies. The first feature is Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror. It's about a group of survivors must stop an evil of dead after an experiment went wrong. Rose McGowan did a great job playing Cherry, a gal without a leg and then becomes a gun. Freddy Rodriguez did the ""never miss killer guy"" which was perfect for him as EL Wray. Josh Brolin who did Dr.William Block who was a very crazy guy in Planet Terror and lastly the bad ass chick besides Cherry was Dr.Dakota Block. Then was Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof, it was about a guy named Stuntman Mike who is having a fun time with a bunch of girls, by killing them. He is risking his life as well as the girls who are inside the car, and he always comes back alive with his car. This was a great part for Kurt Russell for playing Stuntman Mike, he raises the roof. All the girls which were awesome, no regrets because Jordan Ladd, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Zoe Bell were bad ass chicks. But Rose McGowan, Rosario Dawson and Vanessa Ferlito were the real girls in Death Proof that showed these girls are hardcore. This movie has it all, gore, action, and nudity.This movie will be in the top for all Tarantino and Rodriguez fans, this sure is in my top.The first one is Planet Terror which is about the military send out monsters the infected people, the soldier's are to but they use this mask with gas to heal them.So in this little town Cherry was with El Wray were talking then crash, then a monster tears out Cherry's leg, not bit. El Wray takes here to the hospital were also is a room full out infected people. The disease spreads and I'll stop up to here, but when you watch the rest it a hardcore action fill with gore, sex, and guns. This part deserves 4 stars. The next is Death Proof, a more calmer movie or is it when a derange driver Stuntman Mike comes in the film.A bunch of girls are about to have a ride to hell, in the beginning there are a set of girls that really matched and had stuff to say, then with Stuntman Mike look at these girls and have fun with them he kills them and boy was it gruesome.Then the next set comes and they were a bit uninteresting, it was the same thing only this time in the car chase, it switches. The girls are after have, which I think was funny and I liked how it ended. If u want to find out if they killed him or not, watch it. To me as a horror movie no, as a action, funny movie yes so 3 and a half stars to me. And of course the great trailers. Machte, Don't, Thanksgiving, Werewolf women of the S.S., and Hobo with a Shotgun. The ones that were best and should be a movie is Machte and Thanksgiving. Machte for action and Thanksgiving for a s##t full of gore. Watch Grindhouse now, a total 4 star movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Halfway to Greatness,"It was difficult for me to give an overall score for this double feature. So I'll start with the first film and go from there.Planet Terror is an absolute masterpiece. If you go and view this film, you will be in the hands of a true genius of the camera. From the missing reels to the dirty look of the film to the way characters are developed and so many smaller things I won't go into, Planet Terror is easily a modern day, ramped up version of a true grind house film. The gore is excessive (again, in a good way) and the story is cheesy (good way). There are things that make absolutely no sense but you don't even care because for the first time in years, there is a film that is fun to watch again. I enjoy going to movies, I love the experience. Rarely have I actually had the kind of fun in a theater that I have at an amusement park. Planet Terror broke this mold and then some. This film alone gets a 9.5 out of 10 easily and honestly I'm only knocking off .5 because of....Death Proof. Tarantino has now lost me as a fan forever I believe. After the literal cheers and laughs and just overall good feeling going through the audience while watching Planet Terror it was horribly disappointing to see Death Proof. It accomplishes it's goal in some ways. It's a grind house film. The problem with that is that it's a classic one, not updated in any way. If you think that's a good thing, sit down and watch ANY of the originals. If you really want an example of how this goes in Grindhouse though, watch your favorite comedy or action movie then watch one. The flow is broken horribly and within 10 minutes the audience went from fun and active to quiet and still. In any other movie this would be a good thing, not so in Death Proof. Tarantino tells no story, has very few bits of humor, and just saturates the audience with pointless dialogue. It's not even classic Tarantino dialogue. It's just boring. And that's all I can say about the entire film. The ending is more about pleasing himself than the audience. The celebrated car chase scene? It's about 10 minutes long and other than impressive stunt work, it's not exciting at all. 2 cars on a dusty road near some fields is not excitement anymore. The film could be 15 minutes and tell the story and that's about as nice as I'll get. 3 out of 10 and that's mostly out of kindness to one of my favorite directors (used to be anyway).So in the end I say see Grindhouse, go with friends, but walk out as soon as Death Proof starts.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A fine tribute to  Austin, strong women, and my uncle Bob","In 1974, my late uncle Robert A. Burns signed on as art director for a film being made by two old friends that he had known since high school: director Tobe Hooper and actor Gunnar Hansen. Together they made the grind-house horror classic ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Over the next dozen years, he worked on countless grind-house movies. Most of them were horror films such as ""The Hills Have Eyes"", ""Tourist Trap"", ""The Howling"" and ""Re-Animator"". However, he also did the Rudy Ray Moore blaxploitation action/comedy ""Disco Godfather"" and the PG-rated romance ""She Came to the Valley"". Typically, he was simply the art director, but he also directed ""Mongrel"" and even played the lead in ""Confessions of a Serial Killer"".Mainstream (or at least art-house) success found many of my uncle Bob's colleagues such as Hooper, Wes Craven, Joe Dante, and John Sayles. Other grind-house alumni include the Coen Brothers, Jonathan Demme, Roger Ebert, Sam Raimi, Oliver Stone and Martin Scorsese. Unforunatley, Bob never shared their mainstream success. By the late 1980's, grind-houses had been replaced by Blockbuster Video and my uncle's showbiz career was effectively over. He spent the last 15 years of his life in relative seclusion, trying to downplay his horror-movie past.But many people today appreciate the sort of films my uncle Bob did during his heyday. They include hot, new directors such as Eli Roth (""Hostel""), Edgar Wright (""Shaun of the Dead""), and Rob Zombie (""House of 1000 Corpses""). And chief among them are 1990's action-movie greats Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. All of these directors have contributed a portion of their talents to ""Grindhouse"", a tribute to the low-budget horror and action movies they grew up with. Rodriguez, Roth, Wright and Zombie all contributed fake trailers. Rodriguez and Tarantino each contributed a feature-length segment done in the style of the old films, but set in modern times.The first segment is ""Planet Terror"", which is basically an Americanized version of ""28 Days Later"" (zombies and rapist soldiers), but with the genders of the two lead actors switched, and the female lead (Rose McGowan) having a machine gun where her leg should be. There are also subplots about a family barbecue stand (doubtless a reference to ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") and a married doctor (Marley Shelton) having a lesbian affair with a stripper (Fergie).The real treat, however is Tarantino's ""Death Proof"". It starts out with some very attractive ladies in tank tops and short shorts spitting out the same kind of dialog regarding sex and obscure pop music as the guys in black suits did in ""Resevoir Dogs"". They have planned a day-long crawl of all the Austin hot-spots before heading out to the lake together in their Honda Civic. Eventually, they catch the attention of Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), who hangs out at the Texas Chili Parlor and tries to impress the ladies with stories of his time in Hollywood back in the '70's & '80's, before CGI cost him his job. He eventually manages to impress Pam (McGowan again) and she agrees to go home with him. That's when she finds out that Mike's car is ""death-proof"", meaning that the car has been modified for stunt work: The driver is encased in shatter-proof glass and has extra seat-belts so he won't get hurt seriously if the car crashes, but there is no protection at all for the passenger. Mike then reveals himself to be a serial killer using his car as a weapon. He shatters Pam's skull against the protective glass with a quick U-turn and then goes after the remaining girls. The girls all die, and he winds up in the hospital--treated by the same married lesbian doctor from ""Planet Terror"". The action fast-forwards to rural Tenessee where Mike has found some more comely young women (Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thomas, and real-life stunt-woman Zoe Bell as herself) to prey on. But what he doesn't know is that they are also professional stunt drivers, at least as skilled as he is. The rest of the movie is the best car chases filmed since the original ""Dukes of Hazzard"" TV series.I actually preferred this movie to the actual grind-house movies for three main reasons: the acting, the writing, and the portrayal of women. If you have ever seen any actual grind-house movies, you know that typically, the acting is by deservedly unknown amateurs, the writing is silly, and that women are typically portrayed as little more than big-breasted sex objects and/or murder victims. But ""Grindhouse"" boasts such accomplished actors as Naveen Andrews and Bruce Willis, as well as grind-house vets Michael Biehn and Jeff Fahey, all at top form. The writing in both features is informed by Rodriguez's commitment to non-stop action and Tarantino's ear for dialog and knack for surprising the audience. And in both features, it is strong women who save the day from evil men.About the only thing I didn't like about ""Grindhouse"" was the filmmakers' insistence on preserving the feel of watching the films in an actual grind-house theater (scratchy print, shoddy projection, missing reels, etc). I felt that these flourishes distracted from the movie's atmosphere. Fortunately, they were gone by the final car chase in ""Death Proof"".My uncle Bob lived just long enough to see the beginning of the current grind-house revival with Tarantino's Shaw Bros. tribute ""Kill Bill, Vol 1 & 2"" and the 2003 remake of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", the movie that started his career. I do not know what he thought about those movies, or even if he ever saw them (I did not speak to him much during his final years). But if you are a fan of the types of films my uncle Bob made, or even just a film fan in general, you owe it to yourself to see ""Grindhouse"" in its unabridged form. 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good For What It Is,"While I have enjoyed some of Tarantino and Rodriguez's previous films, this one fell rather flat for me. The concept alone promises over the top violence, weak characterization, shoddy plots, and could have created a fun experience for movie goers. Sadly, a lot of the fun in this movie seems to have been for the directors alone.The first half of the double feature is Rodriguez's Planet Terror. This zombie gore fest is filled to the brim with violence, sex, and gross out tactics. The problem is that there really wasn't any humor to temper the attempt at recreating camp. By the end, it seemed like Rodriguez had let the genre conventions define his movie, instead of using them to make something worth watching or bring something new to the genre. It leaves Planet Terror as a high budget pastiche of movies that generally weren't that great to begin with.Death Proof is better in this regard, as Tarantino does attempt to twist the genre conventions into something a little different. His characters, while one dimensional, did at least feel real, for the most part. However, his portion of the film is dragged down by extremely long scenes with nothing but mediocre dialog. This could have worked really well if Tarantino had infused it with more of the quotable snap that has been seen in his previous movies. As it was, large sections of the film seemed tedious, particularly after the non-stop action of Planet Terror.Despite the flaws, both films did have strong points. The visual aspects in both were stylish and interesting. The acting was generally competent and occasionally good. Kurt Russel was able to infuse his psychotic Stuntman Mike character with a surprising bit of charm, and Tracie Thoms managed to give her standard Tarantino ""Sassy Black Girl"" some interest. Zoe Bells stunts were great, even if her acting wasn't. Taratino created a fantastic car chase that kept me on the edge of my seat, and Rodriguez's zombies were wonderfully disgusting and creepy. Rose McGowan's go-go dance certainly brought some sex appeal. And the ending of both films was satisfying, Death Proof in particular.Overall, Grindhouse is worth watching. It isn't a great film, but it's good for what it is.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Welcome To Planet Terror! Watch Out For Death Proof!,"Planet Terror was a great movie, I really liked it. It was fun to watch, had a good plot. It was pretty gory, and hilarious. The infected mutant people were pretty cool looking too. Bruce Willis is also in the movie, and has a very funny scene near the end. The funniest part though was with Quentin Tarantino in Planet Terror. Too bad his movie Death Proof was a waste of time. His movie was just boring, except for a few scenes with Stuntman Mike. The girls are annoying, and it's just a pointless movie. It also has one of the worst ending I've ever seen in a movie. The fake trailers were pretty funny especially Thanksgiving and Werewolf Women of the S.S. Hopefully one day all these fake trailers will be made into real movies. Machete is coming out later on, so I don't see why the others couldn't be made. They looked surprisingly sweet from the fake trailers.Definitely see Planet Terror if you like horror comedies and like zombie themed movies you'll enjoy it. Please avoid Death Proof though, that movie was horrible. I stayed hoping it would get better, but it didn't. The only good parts where the car chases and the crash scenes.I give Planet Terror a 9/10 Death Proof gets a 4/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
50/50,"Here is the bottom line on why Grindhouse deserves your attention. Planet Terror was very entertaining and a heck of a lot of fun and had the usual overload of creativity that we have all come to love from Robert Rodriguez. And even though we as an audience have been in this territory before(zombies), Robert keeps it fresh by putting his own spin on things and it tricks us into thinking we are watching something never done before.Now for Death Proof. I'll preface this by saying I really like Tarantino's work. I am not a Tarantino hater like some. Having said that, this is by far his worst output(Except for maybe his Four Rooms short). It is about 45 minutes too long and I found myself bored and annoyed for most of this movie. It really is that dull and his self serving cameos even give the worst offender of all, M. Night Shamylan, a run for his money. There are however two reasons why you should see this movie at least once. The first is Kurt Russell and his incredible charm and humor. And the second is some incredible stunt work not seen in todays dumbed down digital age. We're talking real cars and stunt people here folks. What a novel idea. If you love cinema, watch Grindhouse for all the schlock and the awesome fake trailers but do it on DVD so you can re-watch the coolest of moments and so you can fast forward through most of Deathproof.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly fun time,"Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez both know how to make a movie alone; together, they produce magic. Grindhouse is nothing short of a brilliant idea with many more great ideas inside of it. I laughed, screamed, gasped, gaped, stared, thought, and enjoyed. The duo of films takes some stamina to get through, but by the end you don't even notice because its so much fun. Since Grindhouse is really two films, I'll give separate mini-reviews:PLANET TERROR: Great horror/comedy hybrid. The characters were likable and acting decent (at least better than most horror films). In fact, the characters were great because each one had a distinct, unique attitude around him. The action sequences were phenomenal, if not a little overdone. It seemed that by the end the movie stopped taking itself seriously and threw a few nonsensical ideas around, but considering its genre, thats not much of a problem. It reminded me in many ways of Shaun of the Dead, but even better. It is stylistically bold, and succeeds in being a powerful experience.DEATH PROOF: Started a little slow, but otherwise built up perfectly to the conclusion. There was too much dialog and chatting in some parts, especially considering that the topics of discussion were uninteresting. Other parts were fine, and the action sequences did not disappoint. Kurt Russel gives an impressive performance as Stuntman Mike, the bad-guy. Overall, the film didn't have much of a moral or logical point, but succeeds in entertainment.The two films go together nicely and share many similarities (although at first glance they seem to be entirely different). There are a couple deja-vu moments in Death Proof that were cool. The two films also had several stylistic similarities (which was good). The fake previews before the feature films are a nice touch. Before watching, I was expecting Grindhouse to be a little overrated, but it won me over.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, but highly overrated.","This movie should be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of production company screw ups. What in god's good name possessed the Weinsteins to first market the movie the way they did and then to release it on Easter weekend. I actually was relieved i could at least sit comfortably in the theater. Lastly this movie should have been held to summer and should have been an outdoor theater thing in the places that have them. On To the review Without a doubt the best thing about the whole movie is the first 3 minutes with Danny trejo in machete. I'm a huge fan of movies like dolemite and i think this would be up there. For the lay man Dolemite is a movie that is so ridiculous it is great. The first movie, Planet Terror, is a straight up hoot. The humor is great, the john carpenter theme works, and lastly the girls. The missing reel was timed impeccably. The flaw for this movie is not really a flaw but they had to show Rose McGowan with the gun for a leg in the trailer. A lot of the Joe Schmos saw this and were like ""its not realistic"", well no crap its not supposed to be. It is truly a shame that John Carpenter can't ever get a budget for his movies like they had for this one.The trailers were overblown except for thanksgiving. The rob zombie one i felt was just a crappy rock video until nick cage as foo Manchu. You never know with the junk he's been doing maybe this movie would be a step in the right direction. Then the trailer don't. Its funny but it gets really annoying. And lastly thanksgiving , you find yourself saying did i really just see that. Thats actually a good thing.Heres where the overrated part comes in. Death proof is a giant let down. I felt this was a critic's horror movie. Critics have been crying for changes in the horror play-book. They got their wish. As usual Tarantino gives us a good soundtrack of some rock gems. Also there is some good characterization by the director which is a Tarantino norm. I just felt the movie was ultimately a let down because the Planet terror has you so pumped up and death proof is just really slow and boring. You will find yourself say ""when is something going to happen"". The concept is unique and definitely will be appreciated. I felt the best move would have been to run this one first because it is slow, then planet terror would move at the speed of light. When your are sitting in the theater for over three hours the last thing you want is the last ninety minutes to drag.In all honesty, I felt this movie was very smug. These two guys thought they could make anything and the viewing public would accept it. They thought they were better then the guys who came before them such as John carpenter, Peter Jackson, and Sam raimi. Now before i get crucified, before spider-man and the Lord of the rings, Jackson and Raimi were kings of this type of film. I felt Rodriquez and Tarantino thought they were better then them and it proves names of directors doesn't really mean anything. If its not appealing to the Joe schmoes and Paris Hilton of the world then its not going to be a success. Both movies are good but this really pales in comparison to movies like Army of Darkness or They Live. I loved and respect this concept i just hope they have the balls to make and release to the theater Machete. And Tarantino and Rodriquez if you might see this make Machete a double feature with a revamped remake of Dolemite starring Ving Rhames. Machete and dolemite back to back it wouldn't be stopped.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
the bad-ass extravaganza of the year; B-movie heaven if there ever was,"Ah, Grindhouse movies, loaded for bear with the sickest garbage and clichéd to hell; hell, by the way, not to be taken for granted. The films and trailers presented are half-vomitoriums and half-absurd white-knuckle thrill-rides, where genre is taken apart like scissors on a stretch-Armstrong doll with all of the gooey effluence gushing away on the screen. And unlike some who've already seen the film, I'm not totally certain yet (least on a first-viewing) of which feature I liked/responded to more. They're both imperfect movies, but naturally so, and there's stuff in both that can be criticized for (i.e. Planet Terror goes too far and has dialog written as if by a guy in prison, and Death Proof is maybe too much like a Tarantino movie to really squeeze into the grindhouse mold). Yet on the terms that the filmmakers go for, they totally accomplish ten-fold. It's also just an extreme load of fun and excitement, with the kind of disturbing material that is unequivocally, hysterically funny.Planet Terror is, in some ways, an even more f***ed up horror-show circus of violence and explosions and massive-gun-fire/death-counts and catch phrases than From Dusk Till Dawn was. It certainly marks another high-point for Rodriguez as someone who takes precedence for shocks and wild tricks of the visual medium than ""interesting"" dialog. In this case, Planet Terror revels in the cut-outs from past low-grade genre drek, and it works terrifically in the realm of the premise: noxious gas unleashed on a small town that sparks up ""infected"" people by the dozens-to-later-hundreds of zombie-esquire folk after a stripper, a rogue, law-enforcement folk, doctors, and a couple of babysitter sisters. It's almost a case for how some things- like WRETCHED violence and gore and multiple casualties and excess to a T- won't get an NC-17. Rodriguez also wisely uses two courses of action.First is to make all of these vicious special fx all the more gleeful in the debauchery in its humor- not just the popping sores on the faces, or various limbs affected, but the ""did they actually do that"" moments, (Tarantino's genital area, the wrists of McGraw's doctor daughter), and to wonderfully set-up the look of the Grindhouse picture, where scratches are common as hell, a reel will go missing once in a while (ironically right during or before a hot sex scene), and almost tearing at the seams. This and Machete, his much-anticipated vehicle for the great character actor Danny Trejo, demonstrate Rodriguez's real gifts, and the actors he puts on display (from Cheech to Michael Biehn to surprisingly Rosa McGowan) are completely, hilariously unconscious of the recklessness of schlock like this. In very short, a gas from start to finish, with a nice touch of Carpenter-music (John I mean).In the middle of the two films, by the way, are at least three whacked-out trailers as sort of special guests of Rodriguez and Tarantino's. Far more funnier and audaciously outrageous than the ""normal"" trailers, where Zombie's Werewolves of the SS giving Nicolas Cage his finest moment in film in many years, Wright's DON'T! a fantastic play on a cliché-by-title, and Thanksgiving being maybe the best, most shameless work Eli Roth has done yet (where else am I going to see a turkey get...well, maybe I've already said too much, aside from the greatest line ever: ""White meat or dark meat, they'll both be carved!""). There's the movie-geek in all of us that would wish that all of these movie will someday be made into features, though part of the charm, if one could describe, is that they won't.Tarantino, meanwhile, has something of a totally different route to go on here, which is all relative: Rodriguez, after all, is the first part of a double-billing, and as such makes his with much greater abandon for standards of good taste or common sense, yet is also not completely as strong because of its sort of badness (albeit goodness too). Tarantino is, more appropriately, the second half and not-quite main attraction, even if his might seem like more of a tame and conventional effort when compared to Planet Terror and the incredible trailers. It's an homage to the wild road-chase movies of the early 70s, where Vanishing Point gets a huge nod and Kurt Russell gets the brightest note to a career now overloaded with kids movies. His character, Stuntman Mike, is a wickedly fun masochist who's got attitude by leaps and bounds, and quite the bad-ass car. He doesn't contend with some ladies from the stunt-department of a movie-set, however, where a cat-and-mouse game ensues.And a damn fine game indeed; the car chases in Death Proof should maybe even appeal to those who usually don't take to car chases too highly, namely because Tarantino's got a satirist's eye always at work somehow in the material. The danger comes when it leans towards being talky, as QT tends to do, and one shot in a diner brings Reservoir Dogs very much into mind. But it's also of interest that Tarantino has actually made a very solid action thriller, one that goes one or two steps further than the common road-movie of the old times went, with the craziness there and sort of complimenting Tarantino's clever direction, tough women, and good old rock & roll.So gear up in your dirty seat, if you can find one, with a bunch of friends in a crowded theater, and make sure not to miss the little animated intros to the ""parental advisory"" warning before each movie. It's the movie 'event' of the year, particularly for fans of unrepentant action and gruesome carnage.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Planet Terror much better than Death Proof,"I have been waiting for Grindhouse for forever and I was so excited to go see it. Upon watching Planet Terror, I was so ready for what I thought was going to be the better of the two, considering it was QT but alas I was proved extremely wrong. All it was was dialog, and one scene of action of what I saw. Planet Terror was brilliantly funny and a perfect parody of all the slasher films. Granted, I know Death Proof is QT's normal style, but if anything, this movie should have come first. I could have handled all of the dull pointless conversation at the beginning but after sitting there for almost 2 hours before Death Proof began, there was no way. My friend and I walked out halfway through Death Proof, we couldn't stand the, like I said, pointless and irrevocably dull characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
DON'T!!!!! (But I Did),"Like the classic double-features it pays homage to, ""Grindhouse"" features one half far superior to the other. The two-for-the-price-of-one deal is a mixed bag of schlocky, exploitative crap that pays off early for movie buffs.""Planet Terror""--8/10. Like his ""Sin City,"" Robert Rodriguez's zombie fest is pulpy, unapologetic over-the-top fun. He perfectly captures the spirit of the grindhouse films of old. His film is funny, violent, ridiculous, and pointless in all the right places and continually delivers the money shots of oozing flesh wounds, exploding bodies, severed limbs, decapitations, and chicks with machine guns (and one, Rose McGowan, with a machine gun leg that is every bit as spectacular as you imagined). The cast is all in on the joke and spectacularly game at every point (Marley Shelton as the lesbian anesthesiologist and Jeff Fahey as J.T. ""the barbecue man"" standing out). Operating at a crisp clip with no-nonsense or any attempt to parade as art, ""Planet Terror"" offers plenty bang for your buck and could easily stand alone. It's the perfect example of giddy ""insider-fetish"" film-making where the director entertains the audience by first pleasing himself.The ""fake trailers"" shown before and after ""Planet Terror"" are laugh-out-loud hilarious and operate brilliantly as both spoofs and homages. My personal favorite was Edgar Wright's trailer for the searing psychological thriller ""DON'T!"" which in a sad bit of irony, could've been the tag-line for what comes next.""Death Proof""--5/10. Quentin Tarantino's rambling tale of an ex-stuntman stalking annoying and shallow women with his ""death proof"" car operates like a retarded Frankstein monster of a film made up of all the worst parts of Tarantino's past efforts. A great performance from Kurt Russell and some fun car chase scenes aside, the rest is chock full of bad acting, worse writing and self-satisfied direction. This is the type of film where arbitrary dialogue is spouted by overly hipster actors playing non-characters we can't wait to see die. Tarantino directs it smugly as he parades women in their undies and hot pants around and shows us some cool cars getting banged up, but it has no sense of fun to it. It's the perfect example of banal ""insider-fetish"" film-making that bores its audience because the director first and foremost pleases himself.Bottom line: Where as the ""Kill Bill"" films should've been edited down to one flick, this movie, joined at that skull like deformed twins, should've been severed. Oddly then the film-makers would've been left with a horrifying scenario. No one would want to see Tarantino's half.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Quit Quentin! He's lost his touch!,"While the first movie (Planet Terror )was good and gory and whatnot, Deathproof, the second movie by Tarinto himself pretty much sucked!I realize this was a throwback to 70's style cornball movies, but I don't think that makes it OK to devoid it of character completely!The long;drawn out girlie conversations had nothing to remember--No ""Royal with cheese"", no ""Oh that you and me's""-- just a bunch of gibber jabber that wasted a bunch of my time! The story and characters really lacked that Tarintino touch we all know so well.After he signed his name as a producer onto Hostel and beginning with Kill Bill, he seems to have become too concerned about the hype surrounding a movie, rather than the quality and putting his signature touch on his works.As of this point his name means nothing to me anymore--",,Anonymous,Horror

"Good, but could have been better","Tarantino does not get the joke.Robert Rodriguez gets the joke. Planet Terror is an incredibly gory, off the wall parody of exploitation action/horror movies, complete with all the right characters, a knowingly silly script, intentionally stupid dialog, and ridiculous amounts of violence. Planet Terror is a gory comedy, with some horror elements, in the same spirit of Bad Taste, Evil Dead 2, and Scream. It's not a very good movie, but it was never meant to be. That's the joke.Tarantino didn't get the joke. Tarantino went ahead and instead made an actual exploitation movie. Unlike Planet Terror, Tarantino plays it completely straight faced, and besides a few editing jokes near the beginning, there really isn't anything in the movie that differentiates it from your normal summer slasher material.This being said, Death Proof is a better movie than Planet Terror. It's better made, executed, and the last 20 minutes are pure dynamite! It just isn't funny.It's not a parody of exploitation movies, it IS an exploitation movie, which is fine, but it doesn't fit with anything in Grindhouse up to then. Imagine going to see Friday the 13th and the last half of the movie is Jason gaining intelligence and having to come to terms with the crimes he's committed through painful introspection.Who the hell wants to see that? Either you want to see a horror comedy or you want to see a regular horror movie, and in either case you certainly don't want to watch it for over three hours.Grindhouse would have been a 9, rather than an 8, if they were either released separately (you could have even had a 'which movie is better, you decide' advertising campaign), or cut about 45 minutes out of the entire thing (or 22.5 minutes a movie). There are plenty of disgusting hospital scenes in Planet Terror and useless conversations in Death Proof that all belong on the cutting room floor.This never would of happened of course, for the same reason the new King Kong wasn't edited even though it badly needed it: they were ego movies. That isn't to say they were bad movies. They just could have been so much better.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Bad at all. But the first movie is better than the second.,"With Grindhouse, I enjoyed both segments of the movie. I also enjoyed the false previews and all the scratchy lines that were added to make it look more like the old grind-house films that these two movies copied. Out of both films, I found Planet Terror by Robert Rodriquez to be my favorite. It's all out action and gore. Death Proof, the second segment by Quentin Taratino was okay, but the first half of that segment was pretty dull. It was mostly uninteresting dialog in a bar, but the last half of that act and the second act following it were well worth it.We start with Planet Terror. In this story we discover that some sort of chemical is released and soon turns people into the walking dead. Like Romero's zombies (the movie that this film follows) these zombies also enjoy eating people. It is up to a ragtag bunch of people who seem to be immune to stop the disaster before it takes over the world. The dialog was hysterical and I enjoyed all the characters because they were all stereotypes of other characters in other horror movies. One of the characters, who loses a leg, even gets a automatic rifle which becomes her new leg. She uses the new weapon to wipe out hordes of the zombies. Hysterical and intentionally so. The whole movie was.This is followed by Death Proof. The first half of this segment has a group of girlfriends meeting in a bar to celebrate one of their friend's birthdays. This part of the movie, like I said above, was boring because of a lot of lame dialog. Maybe I didn't get it and am missing something, but I didn't find any of the dialog to be interesting at all. It does help in letting us know a little about the characters before things take a very serious and horrifying turn in the second half which was the best part of this half of Death Proof. This all leads into the second act of Death Proof which was incredible. Robert Rodriquez in Planet Terror celebrated all the zombie movies and George Romero, and this time around Quentin Taratino celebrates movies like Vanishing Point. Movies where muscle cars ruled and were involved in high speed car chases. This was a wonderful second act.Grindhouse is the type of movie that will work for both the older generation and the younger generation of moviegoers. Many of the older people who were teenagers in the fifties and sixties will probably find this movie wonderful and nostalgic. Those from the younger generation of movie goers will find it to be fun, and give them a sense of something new to talk about. Those in between will like it as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Tarantino Has Done It Again; Rodriguez, Not So Much","What ""Grindhouse"" proves more than anything is how much better a director Quentin Tarantino is than Robert Rodriguez. It's unfortunate for Rodriguez that his film and Tarantino's are being presented in a format that allows the audience to compare them side by side; the comparison only highlights Rodriguez's flaws and Tarantino's talent.""Planet Terror,"" Rodriguez's segment, is a tribute to the trashy zombie flicks of yesteryear, but it's a completely disposable movie. I know Rodriguez would probably take that as a compliment, since the grindhouse films to which he and Tarantino are paying homage are remembered for being the movie equivalent of junk food. But Tarantino creates a film that could easily stand alone outside of the double feature gimmick concept, while Rodriguez uses his opportunity at genre parody to make nothing but a frenetic gross-out film. I had fun with a lot of ""Planet Terror."" I especially liked Rose McGowan, as go-go girl (don't call her a stripper) Cherry Darling, who gets her leg gnawed off by crazed zombies and has it replaced with a machine gun that she uses to mow down her enemies while performing gymnastics. It's hooks like these that keep ""Planet Terror"" afloat. Rodriguez uses today's advanced technologies to include all of the outrageous images and stunts that makers of trash cinema would maybe have included themselves if they could have. But much of ""Planet Terror"" just made me feel sort of bad and depressed. The sight of mass human carnage in these post-9/11 days, when footage of suicide bombings assaults us on a daily basis, carries unpleasant connotations, and it's awfully difficult to lose yourself in the ""fun"" of seeing bodies ripped and blown apart with all of the indifference of a director who gets off on the site of human bloodshed. Therefore, I felt a slight sense of relief when ""Planet Terror"" ended.But then Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" came roaring on to the screen, and memories of Rodriguez's segment were immediately wiped away. In ""Death Proof,"" Kurt Russell plays stuntman Mike, who uses his grizzled charm to lure girls (like Rose McGowan, who pops up again in this segment, albeit in a very different role) into his bitchin' retro car and then kills them. Or he follows groups of girls riding in their own cars and plows into them at 200 miles per hour, as he does in the film's most disturbing and graphic scene. But after doing away with one such group, he sets his sights on another (the immensely charismatic trio of Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms and real-life stuntwoman Zoe Bell, who plays herself) -- and instantly recognizes his mistake. Half way through ""Death Proof,"" Tarantino switches gears, and instead of following a ""girls in danger"" template, he makes the girls the dangerous ones. It's as if every female ever victimized in a grade-Z horror flick is resurrected in this group of fierce females, and work through them to get their revenge. The film is unpredictable, fresh, rousing and immensely exciting. It sent me out on a high.Tarantino is incapable of making a thoughtless movie, and I'm beginning to think he's incapable of making a bad movie. Where Rodriguez is content to appeal to the most basic urgings of the adolescent males he clearly assumed would be his audience for this, Tarantino is interested in doing something more. ""Death Proof"" is not simply imitative of grindhouse cinema. Tarantino has always excelled at mimicking the genres he loves while making something completely unique out of them, and he does the same here. ""Death Proof"" isn't only an homage to the loved films of Tarantino's past; it's also an elegy. Stuntman Mike is a relic of an age when filmmakers created special effects in real time and space, without the help of CGI, and indeed no CGI was used in the astonishing extended action sequence that comprises the last third of Tarantino's film. He recognizes grindhouse films as the trash that they were, but it's clear that they also represent to him a certain kind of freedom that doesn't exist for filmmakers anymore. Makers of grindhouse movies knew that their films were going to be discounted by the mainstream movie establishment anyway, so they could revel in a kind of artistic freedom and make the movies they wanted to make without thought as to box office or awards potential. It's no wonder that this particular genre appeals to an auteur like Tarantino.And of course, linking these two films are the batch of fake trailers for other sleazy cinematic offerings. ""Thanksgiving"" seems to be the one that audiences remember the most, but I actually thought ""Don't"" was the wittiest, and the one that felt most authentic.""Planet Terror"": B-""Death Proof"": A",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
planet terror ruled...death proof didn't,"Now I always believed that Rodriguez topped Tarantino. Tarantino was the big name and Rodriguez isn't so commonly known among my friends. I went into the Grindhouse with the expectation that Rodriguez would deliver an explosive film of greatness and Tarantino would come in second. In my opinion, I guessed right.The first time I watched Pulp Fiction, I loved it. Next couple of times I saw it over the years, I started to realize it was a touch overrated. The same goes for the rest of Tarantino's work. However, I can never get bored with Sin City or Desperado. Another thing is, all of Quentin's movies are honestly the same. They all have meaningless conversations involving foot massages and Cajuna Burgers or however you spell it. And these conversations go on forever and ever and they don't even sound real, but totally scripted and planned out. I can only say that for Death Proof, there was the one scene with the chick on the hood of the car that I held my breath.Robert Rodriguez may also have a repetitive style. Planet Terror was similar to the From Dusk Til Dawns. But, if you expected it to be close to exactly the same, guess again. Planet Terror was ten times as intense as I expected it to be. I won't give anything away because there's no way I can explain the craziness of it. I can only say that it's awesome and the trailers for Grindhouse do not show anything.Speaking of trailers, how can I forget. The fake movie ""prevues"" were filled with humor and creativity. The Rob Zombie preview ""Warewolf Women of the SS"" left me laughing for quite a bit, and Eli Roth's ""Thanksgiving"" was outstanding.So, once more, I say watch all the way until just at the beginning of Death Proof and walk out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The most fun I've had watching a movie in a long time,"Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are brilliant. Although some say the films weren't sleazy enough (and that is kinda true) they are the first directors to truly capture the feel of grindhouse movies. I'm talking a very grainy, scratched look, missing reels and the greatest (fake) trailers I've ever seen. They are both violent, foul and just a blast.Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" is a good old-fashioned zombie romp. Once the action starts it literally never stops. It's gory as all hell, funny, with a cast of great actors (Tom Savini, Michael Biehn, Michael Parks, Rose McGowan, Bruce Willis) and an interesting plot.Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" is a slasher flick, with a car. Kurt Russell is Stuntman Mike, a stuntman who likes to run over girls in his car, which is 100% death proof. This one is much slower than ""Planet Terror"" but it isn't worse. The look of the film I feel is more genuine here but it isn't as action packed as ""Planet Terror."" But this movie does have the most tense car chase I've ever seen.Also thrown in the mix are four fake trailers. Rodriguez's ""Machete,"" Edgar Wright's ""Don't,"" Rob Zombie's ""Werewolf Women of the SS"" and Eli Roth's ""Thanksgiving."" They are all perfect in capturing the feel of old grindhouse movies but Roth's is the best.For a great time look no further. Grindhouse provides everything you could want in a brainless blockbuster. Forget Spiderman 3, this is best blockbuster of the year.5/5",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Tarantino bores with more banter boll ox, but at least Rodriguez knows what this whole Gringhouse thing is supposed to be - funny, disgusting, and way way over the top!","Call the Cool Police but am I the only one who thinks Tarantino is a one trick pony? He established his trademark snappy dialog and pop culture referentialisms with his first two films and has been trading on that success ever since! Like a Bon Jovi concert, each and every effort tries and fails to recapture the spirit of the original, only to fall back on the tried and tested to save its ass. Everyone has been wetting their pants about the whole Grindhouse thing ever since the banana-chinned one first starting blabbing about it, but I'm not too sure why - surely for two experienced filmmakers it should be no trouble at all to copy a sub-genre that at best is cult viewing and at worst a load of old balls, poorly scripted, poorly acted, poorly produced - so why should such filmmakers be given huge credit for recreating such shoddy films on a much larger budget?Having said that, Robert Rodriguez's 'Planet Terror' is an excellent example of everything these types of films should be - humor, fighting, sex, loose storyline only held together by the sheer unbelievability and gross out quality of the action sequences, and the so-bad-it's-good effects that gave all such low budget gore-fest such a cult status. Basically every aspect needs to be way over the top and Planet Terror delivers in buckets, from the deliberately hammy performances from actors we know can really act, to the excellent 80's John Carpenter style soundtrack, and an excess of blood and exploding body parts I haven't seen since Peter Jackson hung up his butchers chopper. Great fun.SPOILER ALERT!!!I for one much preferred Planet Terror to Tarantino's effort - Death Proof - which is 20% grind house and 80% typical Tarantino fodder whereby the characters spend what seems like an eternity exchanging snappy one-liners and pop culture references, while offering almost nothing in the way of character or narrative development. Further more, for its 90 min run time, the first 45mins is spent with a load of characters that you never see again.I guess it could be argued that Tarantino cleverly turns horror conventions on its head by forcing the viewer to invest time and energy in these characters, only for them to be suddenly snatched from us in an original, but not wholly unexpected way, thus calling into question our preconceptions of everything we may see thereafter. A notion further suggested by the introduction of the new (yet very similar) characters in the remaining 45mins - supposedly we should be expecting a repeat of the first act, but it is clear from the off that these girls are very different from the last unfortunate bunch.If this generic tinkering was his intention it didn't work for me. I was left with a feeling that I had just wasted the best part of an hour of my life watching attractive women spouting unlikely Tarantinoisms, only for the whole thing to begin again with a load of new, yet equally attractive characters doing exactly the same thing. I have heard that Tarantino has said these girls talk just like women talk today - well I don't know what women he's hanging out with, but most of the girls I know are not anywhere near as rapier-witted, poetic or downright pretentious as this lot. I think it's more a case of this is how Tarantino would talk today if he was a woman. There's far too much exposition and choreographed dialog that tries desperately to recreate some of the genius scripting seen in Dogs or Pulp Fiction. Unfortunately it fails on all counts, and while the car chase scene is impressive, it is completely at odds with the rest of a movie that is far too well acted, slick, and rehearsed to be considered part of the Grindhouse canon. Ultimately, we are left with characters we don't really give two shits about, so the Thelma and Louise style retribution is solely for comic effect from caricatures - a tone that is lowered to limbo height for the abrupt farcical conclusion crudely tacked onto the end as if to say ""see, I was only messing about! Look how funny and violent Grindhouse is Tarantino style"". Kurt was on good Snake Plisken form though, frowning and growling his way though, and all credit to Zoe Bell though, who for a stunt woman put in an excellent acting performance - though if your stunt woman is getting credit for her acting you know the film has gone wrong somewhere.If Tarantino had wanted a slapstick Charlies Angels with added ""MotherF*#ker!"" business he should'v made one from the out set. I was left with a feeling that poor old Quentin was happily making another Tarantino movie, until someone (probably Rodriguez) reminded him that this was supposed to be a Grindhouse flick. Of course I could be taking it all too seriously, as neither film is supposed to be taken as a piece of cinematic art, but where Planet Terror succeeds in introducing the genre to a new breed of movie-goer with tongue firmly in cheek, Death Proof feels more like the bastard offspring of Pulp Fiction and Britteny Spears's Crossroadsthan Grindhouse, like we'v seen and heard it all before, but much much better.I'd give it 7 out of 10 for both films or 8 for Planet Terror alone or 5 just for Death Proof. Don't believe the hype people.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
On Buying a Bag of Apples....,"To borrow an analogy a friend has used elsewhere, watching parts of this movie was like buying a bag labeled ""apples,"" taking it home, opening it, and discovering the bag is full oranges. Sure, they may be very good oranges, but you paid for apples because you wanted apples, dammit.Planet Terror is in a wrapper that says ""Grindhouse,"" and I was more than satisfied with how it wallows in the grungy joy of the thing. Same deal with the trailers. Those components are entertainingly tattered with savage, unhemmed edges of film-making; they could've proudly displayed such spirited fringes without a need to add bogus film flaws to make this intention obvious to the people in the audience who might not get it.Death Proof has excellent acting and awesome dialog in wonderful, carefully staged set pieces. All those involved should be recognized and commended for their masterful achievements, particularly the director who brought it all together and made it sing. But when you consider the whole, it is too talky and relaxed and doesn't have enough action for a thing in a wrapper that clearly says ""Grindhouse."" Death Proof is bait and switch. You want talk not action? Not in my gindhouse! Try that pansy little art-house theater down the street. Maybe they got some Bergman for you. Or the later works of Woody Allen.Yeah, Death Proof is one of the best oranges I've ever seen, but I paid for apples, dammit.",,Anonymous,Horror
Rodriguez takes gold.,"I just got back from a midnight screening of this movie. I have never been more disappointed in Tarantino. He has the crowd by the balls just because he is Tarantino and now he is using his fame to f-ck around and make this half thought out undeveloped load called Death Proof. What a waste of time, that second movie. The entire storyline sucked, the actors were very annoying and worst of all the dialogue went on for so long people started leaving the theater. I stayed and watched the entire drawn out second movie. Wow, the violence in the second one even sucked. He has pulled off the long talking scenes in other movies, but that was in movies that had actual plots like Pulp Fiction!!! This sucked! The story is about a guy who drives a car around and kills people. This wouldn't be that bad, but the trouble is it takes 50 plus minutes to get to the killing, while in the meantime we are watching the most ridiculous things. It's not art, like his last movies.Rodriguez however, made the hilarious Planet Terror, which blew me away! It was funny and personally I think he should be the headliner of the show because the gore and great humor impressed the crowd a lot more than the nonsense in the second movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Grindhouse - Hit and Miss,"This could easily be the movie of the year in itself with no advertisements, yet it will be hard to get a crowd that doesn't leave the theater when Planet Terror is over thinking the movie was over...which is what happened at the theater I went to. Almost half of the people got up and left, which is probably going to hurt the films income in the theater due to many people thinking it was a short film,  Or maybe they've seen the movie already and just came for Planet Terror! Who knows, both features were excellent, including screenplay, plot outline and both acting and directing. I can safely say I liked Planet Terror a lot more than Death Proof in many ways.Planet Terror: This feature had everything you would ever want in a fast paced, up-to-date, horror film. Blood, Guts, Missing Brains, Bubbling Flesh, and Bruce Willis being in control, as usual, all make it a perfect Saturday night at the movies. Rose McGowan scorches the screen and Freddy Rodriguez went flawless in every scene he was in. Marley Shelton's best role by far, as she was stunning and I can't forget Michael Biehn, who I've been a fan of ever since Aliens. His character was the highlight of Planet Terror, he fit his role perfectly. The acting all in all was so good and the directing was so precise in this feature, I didn't want it to end at all. There were many little ""quirks"" that kept the audience laughing and on edge off and on the entire film, at perfect times. Plenty of excitement, great one-liners and insane special effects make this feature worth seeing by itself. This was a definite Hit!Death Proof: This feature starts off decent, but slowly loses the audience due to many minutes of pointless dialog with absolutely nothing happening to take interest to. Death Proof itself would be a great movie to watch and just that, but I think that the audience still wanted more excitement after watching Planet Terror, that we didn't expect it to slow down as much as it did. But at any rate, it picks up at the end and the chase scenes were spectacular alone, well worth the 45 minutes of boredom for the end to finally take place, and it does with a bang. Zoe was the highlight of this feature hands down, she is an amazing actress and an even better stunt devil. Some of the things she was doing were kind of pointless but it's WHAT she was doing that was exciting to watch, and that goes without saying Kurt Russell's performance was great, as usual, very good acting and he played his part perfectly. I can't think of anyone that could have played that role better. Although there were some parts in this feature that were incredible, most of it was pointless, and sadly enough, I thought that Death Proof could have gone a lot better, so it was a Miss.I recommend this film to anyone who's a fan of gore, action, comedy, hot chicks, explosions, zombies and pure adrenaline. It was a spectacular film and worth the 2 hour drive we took to go see it and I aim to see it again next week when it comes to my town.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"live life to its fullest, goriest, and coolest","By now, everyone should know that ""Grindhouse"" is a full-scale homage to the exploitation flicks of the '60s and '70s. It begins with a spoof add for fictional action flick ""Machete"" (""If you want him to kill the bad guy, the bad guy better not be you!"") starring Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin.But then, we get to see the first movie: Robert Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"". This zombie/infection has got to be one of the goriest movies that I've ever seen...and I love it. They pull absolutely NO punches here. It's the sort of movie that isn't afraid to do whatever the hell it wants, as Rose McGowan (Neve Campbell's friend in ""Scream""), Freddy Rodriguez (Rico on ""Six Feet Under""), Marley Shelton, and a whole bunch of others have to fight back when army tests turn people into zombies.After ads for ""Werewolf Women of the SS"" (starring Nicolas Cage as Fu Manchu), ""Don't"" (""If you're planning to open that door...don't!"") and ""Thanksgiving"" (""This holiday, you'll be coming home...in a body-bag!""), we get to see Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof"". This one starts off somewhat confusing, but definitely gets going once wacko motorist Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) chases four women down a country road. The whole chase is the sort of stuff that Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner only dreamed of. You have to see it to believe it.All in all, this movie is an experience unlike anything else. It's impossible not to like. So definitely go see it, and I'm sure that you'll enjoy it. Also starring Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin, Zoe Bell, Sydney Poitier, and Tarantino himself in appearances in both films.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A nice trip down memory lane,"This was a wonderful jaunt down memory lane for both my wife and myself. We used to hit our drive-in movie theater for such fare as Last House on the Left/Don't Look In The Basement/The House By the Lake triple feature, with all the bad previews. I also remember the Eyeball/Suspiria double feature. This conjured many of the same feelings watching this slice of exploitation Americana.I truly enjoyed Rodriguez's feature the most. It was true to the logic, gore level and ridiculous excess of my memory.I have to say I was a little disappointed by Quentin Tarentino abandoning the style about midway through his segment. The previews were a stitch. I especially liked the final entreaty in Don't.If you've never had the joy of this type of movie-going experience, you may still enjoy this double feature.

The best $6 I've ever spent,"Read whole review at http://www.imthenews.com/article/72 | To be honest, when I first heard about Grindhouse I wasn't familiar with the name nor the subject matter, however two other names attached to that word rang a bell; Rodriguez and Tarantino, and I was fully aware of what those two names meant.Grindhouse showcases what started these two directors love affair with film and film-making. If you aren't familiar with the grindhouse genre film, you're not alone because this form of film making essentially disappeared from American landscape after the 80's. A grindhouse flick was usually a low budget, over the top and usually exploitive movie that typically took a nihilistic interpretation of your standard cinematic vices of sex, drugs, violence for fast thrills and quick cash for their filmmakers. The showcases for these films were usually grindhouse cinemas that were mostly found in dilapidated urban areas in which two exploitation films are shown back to back for the price of one admission. Grindhouse the movie is nearly a three hours long homage to the spirit of these films and the long gone era that incubated and spawned these films. A notable staple of these films are the fake trailers that come before and in the middle of the movie, these trailers are completely over the top and hilarious and if you loved this movie as I did, don't be surprised to find yourself walking out of the theatre quoting lines from these fake coming attractions.If you haven't heard of either Quentin Tarantino or Robert Rodriguez then you might want to stop reading this review and step outside of your cold war era bunker and proceed to the nearest video store. With both directors coming off from previous hit films; Robert Rodriguez with Sin City and Quentin Tarantino with Kill Bill, they are ready to get audiences onboard with another aesthetic piece of work, and boy was I not a disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Planet Terror--rocked!  Death Proof...needs some work!,"As promised, Grindhouse delivers the goods with bawdy 60's and 70's flair! Planet Terror was a gore fest of fun! Showing enough T&A spiced with some gruesome horror, action and comedy! Rodgriguez movie worked, it was a thrill a second. Rose McGowan, where have you been?!! The previews were hilarious and promised some great grindhouse coming attractions! Death Proof didn't work quite as well for me. After the first bloody carnage, rather the second bloody carnage, perped by Stuntman Mike, the movie dragged endlessly. Why? Well, this was the reason for me: Hitchcock once stated that you make your audience feel uncomfortable when you place someone in harms way. For instance, a beautiful woman sits down on a park bench. Someone places a bomb underneath the bench, unbeknownst to the beautiful woman. The audience sits, anxiously, in their seats awaiting for the hero or someone or her to find the bomb.' The woman could strip, could do a lap dance, could recite poetry...anything...but the audience won't pay any attention because they are mesmerized by the ticking bomb. Stuntman Mike was that ticking bomb and all the while Tarantino sets up the scene with the second group of girls, in the cafe, in their car...you are waiting for the ticking bomb...Stuntman Mike to appear with another gruesome display of madcap, brutal and gruesome carnage. So, all the while the gals are talking, I am not paying any attention to those scenes and the movie appears to drag.All in all, I would say this was a fun movie to go see. Though, be leery of the length of this movie. I missed one of the prevues because I HAD to dash to the restroom so I wouldn't miss any of the full second feature. I paid $9 bucks to see this flick...which I thought was dreadful...like paying huge dough to see the Stones or some other old group ripping off its fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"They Spent $67,000,000 to make a Cheap Looking Double feature","This was a major box office bomb. The Box Office Gross was $25,000,000 but by the time advertising was factored in it lost over $50,000,000. Now excluding that do we have a good film (s) here? Well ""NO"".To me the film goes on way too long. Each of these films should have been less than 90 minutes. Both of them had scenes that went on way too long. There is also the obligatory ""Rape"" or ""Fear of Rape"" that Quentin Tarantino puts in his films! This time its in ""Planet Terror"" and he is the villain Regardless the man is talented but why he puts rape in his films makes me pass on seeing anything else He will do for now on!""Planet Terror"" is the weakest of the 2 films presented here. The story is stupid. I know that was the pint but had this film was made with a low budget film would have worked better.""Death-proof"" is good but goes on way too long. Quentin loves talky talky dialog and again this film would have been better served if the film was made with just 1 or 2 takes. What was so suppose to be a ""Low Budget"" homage was basically a slick looking action movie that has a 1970's vibe!The ""Fake"" coming attractions are very good and work the best. ""Machete"" was later turned into a real film.This film was a disappointment for many reasons! Too long being the most irksome!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One good feature the other passable,"I watched Planet Terror and Death Proof through the Grindhouse Cut rather than the International Cuts that separated and extended the lengths of the features. The fake trailers in-between the features were good fun. I liked the Machette and Don't ones the most, but each had a B-Movie/Trashy feel that gave it some style and I wouldn't mind if all of them actually were made as a feature film one day.Planet Terror: Despite being a fan of Zombie/Horror stuff, this surprisingly didn't impress me as much as I hoped. I liked some of the special effects/action, but it didn't offer anything I hadn't already seen in previous zombie films. It doesn't really do anything bad per se, but I've sort of already forgotten about it. Even the chick with the gun on her leg was like whatever. Outside of the action/zombie stuff it's kind of meh and forgettable. I doubt the International Cut would have improved it that significantly. 6/10Death Proof: Now this worked better for me. Not perfect though as there's a bunch of lengthy scenes with pointless dialogue and whiny girls that drag it down, but the aesthetic Tarantino brings and the stuff involving Death Proof is pretty good. Kurt Russell gives a fun performance as the stuntman. I liked the protagonist/slasher film subversions it does and the big car chase sequence the film has. I felt the Grindhouse Cut was a good length. Any longer would have probably make me dislike it. 7/10So overall I appreciate the tone and style Grindhouse was going for. I liked the idea of trailers being on-between the features, and some of the aesthetic/tone choices that were made to recapture specific types of films. On the other hand, I only properly like one of the two films. The other one I'd probably skip and just watch the fake trailers instead. Still worth watching the entire Grindhouse Cut though.6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It Was Not Very Good...Then It Went Downhill,"I was not prepared for these movies to be SO BAD!The critics supposedly liked Tarantino's half, Death Proof, better than Rodriguez's Planet Terror, so I was hoping for a lift during phase two. Uh-uh. Tarantino's film is mostly sheer boredom confused with some truly nonsensical plot twists and spiced up with ""action"" sequences that drag on and on and on. The Dukes Of Hazzard did it better every week. People in the audience started walking out after about 10 minutes, and the trend continued almost to the end of the movie. One time a whole group got up together and left, it was that dull.Speaking of homages there are a lot of them, some of which are so obscure that I'll explain a couple. The three names on the drink cup, Automatic Slim, Fat Ed and T-Bird were bad guys in a terrific Vietnam revenge movie called Rolling Thunder (1977) starring William Devane and Tommy Lee Jones as returned American POW's. According to the IMDb's Trivia entry for Rolling Thunder, ""Quentin Tarantino said that this film was his favorite vengeance-movie. 'I saw it on a double feature with 'Enter the Dragon,' and it's better than 'Enter the Dragon,'' Tarantino said."" If you can find a copy, I recommend you buy it and watch it in one sitting with few distractions. It's a classic. Luke Askew, one of the all-time underrated bad guys of film, plays Automatic Slim.The other comes from a movie called Telefon (1977) which is a Charles Bronson CIA vs KGB action adventure, in which Donald Pleasance triggers secret agents with the Robert Frost lines, ""The woods are lovely, dark and deep. But I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep."" There are lots more.The fake trailers, called ""Previews"" on screen just like in the 1970's are the best little bits, but that's the problem, they're just little bits. I liked ""Machete"" the best but they're all good and they're all pretty hilarious.Planet Terror is the better half of this twin-bill, but that's not saying much. It certainly has a cast that's head and shoulders better, and it's much better acted (although Kurt Russell does his usual amazing job in Death Proof). Plus the story is coherent with a beginning, a middle and an end, and the plot is well developed. It's just not very good. In its favor it has one or two real surprises and a good deal of humor.If this is a must-see for you, fine, go see it. But if you're on the fence having trouble deciding, save your money and your three hours plus. If you're a real fan of good movies and good movie-making, wait for Rodriguez's next effort. As for Tarantino, he's going to have trouble digging himself out of this hole. Death Proof actually makes me wonder if the years of excess have gotten to him.",,Anonymous,Horror
Grindhouse: A Nastolgia trip worth taking,"Grindhouse is a double feature throwback to the olden days of exploitation theater. Where anything goes and everything went. Since the movie pushes three hours (almost 200 minutes), ""Planet Terror"" and ""Death Proof"" are worthy for their individual critiques.Planet Terror: ""Planet Terror"" is Robert Rodriquez' contribution to the double feature that is ""Grindhouse"", and it's certainly the better movie of the two. No contest. The by now clearly multi-faceted (from Spy Kids to Sin City) director handles this project with ease.""Planet Terror"" tells the tale of Cherry Darling, a stripper who loses her leg in an 'attack', and El Wray, a gunslinging renegade, who attempt to flee a small Texan community being overrun by a mysterious viral infection (you know, the usual zombie apocalypse story).You'd think that with all this blood and carnage, things like plot and drive would be overlooked. Prepare to be pleasantly surprised to find a heart pumping all that blood. The tales of the survivors (the usual rag-tag group of idiots somehow lucky enough to find a way through it all) are for the most part well acted, suspenseful and engrossing. Kudos to Rose McGowan & Freddy Rodriguez (Cherry and Wray), Josh Brolin & Marley Shelton - an anesthesiologist and her psychotic husband - and Michael Biehn & Jeff Fahey - a grill master and his deputy brother - for portraying their parts exceptionally well. 4.5/5Death Proof: Quentin Tarantino's second half of Grindhouse is certainly not the better half. ""Death Proof"" comes off more boring than it is exhilarating because of it's stupefyingly slow pacing about a killer stunt driver.""Death Proof"" is the exploitation story of ""stunt man mike"", former stunt driver of a 'death proof' car from hell that he uses to commit unusual acts of vehicular homicide against women. This 90 odd minute feature is a tale told in two acts as he pursues two packs of prey.Although the action is about nothing more than speed, the pacing is about anything but. Tarantino goes into incredibly long and detailed conversations and tangents that have the same air of the exchanges and dialogs in Pulp Fiction. Heck, practically every clichéd Tarantinoism is employed in lengthy cuts that would make Kenneth Branagh himself flinch (reference to cinematography in Hamlet from 1996). The thing is, they all go ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE! All the wit, quips and remarks are useless in the end, except for perhaps extending a 30 minute film by a good hour. A fact likely to be gleefully overlooked because, hey, it's Tarantino! Death Proof may go over well for people hyped up on exploitation, nostalgic for classic Tarantino writing (useless as it is seen here), or those in admiration of Kurt Russel or adoration of Rosario Dawson, Rose McGowan or any of the other seven leading ladies, but there's really nothing here aside from that. Well... the soundtrack is excellent too (I guess). 2.5/5The faux Trailers and style: Some of the best moments of Grindhouse are in the way it's filmed with nostalgia in mind, and the fake trailers sure to go on the list of movies ""that aren't real but should be made"". If such ideas like ""Hobo With A Shotgun"" and ""Thanksgiving"" (complete with a slasher pilgrim) don't make you laugh out loud as you flinch a bit while you watch them, you might be a bit too use to the idea of teenage girl getting stabbed in the baby maker as she jumps on a trampoline. Then of course there's Cheech Marin making an appearance as Father Benecio Del Toro in ""Machete"", Edgar Wright's (Shaun of the Dead) laugh out loud trailer for ""Don't!!"", and Rob Zombie's tribute to sexploitation with ""Werewolf Women of the SS"", the trailers should not be missed for a refill of your gallon cup of cola.And then of course there's the style. The grittiness of the films seem to be amplified with classic low budget filming methods that, while overbearing at times, usually work in favor for ""Grindhouse"". Missing reel notices and all, it's a unique cinema experience. 5/5Grindhouse is an interesting movie if only for the sheer fact that it works. That doesn't mean to say it's an amazing movie by any stretch. While ""Planet Terror"" could potentially stand on it's own, ""Death Proof"" is decidedly just a cut above average, and mediocre when it comes to Tarantino fare. See it for Planet Terror, the trailer, the style, and the end of Death Proof. It's a lot of fun, and at over 3 hours, you get your money's worth! 4/5",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Kurt Russell, Tarantino, severed balls, and Fergie? Sign me up!","Grindhouse? What the hell does that mean? Is this even something I'd enjoy? A typical moviegoer would say ask those questions. One who's typical night out includes seeing a high budgeted film in a theater with anti-sticky floors, nice leather seats, and viewing the cinematic experience in the finest audio and video presentation possible. Not to mention, one who's spending a mere ten bucks on a late outing with a soul film, that typically, doesn't deliver what it promises. Grindhouse is exactly the complete opposite of that. Grindhouse is typically defined as a double feature, in which two B-flick films (oh no, you won't find a DeCaprio here) play back to back, while trailers serve as the intermission. Not to mention that grindhouse experiences consisted of those annoying product placements and how heavily they emphasize on a restricted rating. As for people that know what a Grindhouse is and misses the experience they once had, well folks, here's your chance! Step right up and pay your ten bucks for two films, fake trailers, ""restriction"" cards, and a restaurant advertisement. Don't go in searching for the latest Hollywood actor, some fancy set pieces, or a clear picture and chances are, you'll probably have a fun time.THE MOVIES ____________Planet Terror: ***1/2 out of (****) or 8/10. Basically, this film has a copy-and-paste script since the plot is paper-thin and it involves the usual, ""virus breaks out and people get infected"" concept. However, that's what makes this film more overall effective. Planet Terror is the first film to be featured in the double-bill and rightfully so. The performances are top- notch, the pacing is brisk, the body count is plentiful, and it's just boatloads of fun. How can you go wrong with a Fergie cameo, a Quentin Tarantino cameo, Robert Rodriguez in the director's chair, severed balls, a go-go dancer with a machine gun for a leg, and her Mexican companion? Planet Terror is the finest B-flick I've seen because Rodriguez proves to us that even though your film is intentionally bad, that doesn't mean it has to have weak dialog or characters. It can have great characters, some funny one-liners, and a brisk pace added to the mix. Highly recommended.Death Proof: ***1/2 out of (****) or 8/10. Okay, I know many will beg to differ with me putting both movies on par with each other, but let me ask you this. How is it fair to say one film is better than the other when both films are in two entirely different ballparks? If you want a break-neck pace, a ""get-to-the-point"" direction, and hardcore thrills, see ""Planet Terror"". However, if you ask for a little more character development and a rather smoother pace, seek out ""Death Proof"". Honestly, this film is underrated. I mean, yes, there is a lot of redundant dialog, but I was entertained and that twenty minute car crash sequence even made me like this movie more. I can't really say I liked one film over the other. Both set out to do what they wanted and succeeded greatly.THE FAKE TRAILERS ___________________Machete: *** out of (****) or 7/10. You've just *beeped* with the wrong Mexican! That's just one out of many cheesy moments. From a badass Mexican to a three-way pool scene to a priest with guns, this will quench the thirsts of avid B-flick fans. While I liked the faux trailer, it loses a star (or three) because it didn't keep my interest as the others did, but it was still good.Werewolf Woman Of the S.S.: **** out of (****) or 10/10. No lie, I absolutely loved this trailer. I mean it truly showcases how such of a douchebag Hitler was, a nice campy tone, and a Chinese Nicholas Cage. Can this get any better? Apparently so since I gave it a terrific rating.Don't: **** out of (****) or 10/10. This trailer or Thanksgiving was my favorite, even though I love Werewolf Woman Of the S.S. I've always been a sucker for haunted house films and slashers and when I found out ""Don't"" was a mixture of those, I jumped with joy. Seriously, Edgar Wright is a genius. If this becomes a movie, I'm seeing it.Thanksgiving: **** out of (****) or 10/10. By the next sentence, you're either with this trailer or not. A knife to the vagina, A swallowing woman who's boyfriend's head is later decapitated, a turkey stuffed with dead bodies, a man humping a dead body filled with turkey, and a dead poor Grannie. Thanksgiving is a wet dream for B-flick lovers. The picture, the voice-over, the money shots. It's all there.OVERALL EXPERIENCE _____________________Grindhouse: ***1/2 out of (****)Overall, Grindhouse is one hell of an outing. Two nearly perfect films, flawless fake trailers, and corny product placement make this a solid recommendation. If you are wondering folks, I saw the WHOLE thing. From the opening ""Machete"" fake trailer to the credits of ""Death Proof"", I have seen Grindhouse in its fullest. This could not have happened if the sweetie pies over at Vivendi Entertainment didn't release their Grindhouse Blu-ray.

"Rodriguez delivers, Tarantino annoys","The idea of a 70s era double feature with fake trailers was an inspired idea.Machete was my favorite trailer, followed by Thanksgiving, then Don't (Where did they find that Roddy MacDowell look alike, doing a Hell House impression?).Movie wise--Planet Terror was amusing, clever, just the type of inventive energy I expected from something like Slither, but didn't get.It was disgusting, offensive, but you had to admire it for not holding back, and I laughed out loud a few times.Great to see Jeff Fahey again--he stole the show along with Josh Brolin. I almost didn't recognize Michael Biehn! Death Proof on the other hand--I just couldn't stand it. It didn't even feel like an old movie. Rodriguez put a huge amount of effort into his, Tarantino, evidently did not(though he was good in the Planet Terror cameo).One odd thing about the whole project was how they tried to make the film look old(not so much in Death Proof) even though people are using modern technology. I would have preferred more of a retro consistency.The only aspect of Grindhouse that made me think of the 70s was the title credits for Death Proof and bits of the Machete and Don't trailers. Otherwise, Planet Terror seemed more like early to mid 80s in terms of subject matter and feel.It was nice to see that cartoon panther cub morphing into the Restricted sign. Haven't seen it in ages.I give it a 7 for Planet Terror and a couple of the trailers, but Death Proof gets a 0.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Coarse Grind,"Of the two movies I saw today, ""Grindhouse"" merits a mention here simply because it's a hoot! Conceived as an 'hommage' to 70's B double features, the movie consists of two full-length features helmed by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. Taking it further for the full B effect, the movie featured simulated scratches, missing frames or even entire reels making the action jumpy and frustrating to watch right at the most crucial moments. And that's part of the fun, if the viewer ""gets"" it. There were quite a few walkouts from the theater, maybe it's just not for everyone. But those who stayed LOL'd all throughout.The two directors' characteristic elements of gore and violence are there in spades but w/ an R rating, the teen audiences that would go for this kind of thing are shut out. Hilarious too, by the way, are the extras--trailers for non-existent movies (""Werewolf Women of the SS"")concocted to make for a complete viewing experience reminiscent of those times when you could spend the entire afternoon in one of those 3rd-run theaters specializing in movies you'd never heard of but attractively promising silly entertainment. And that's all you get, because that's all it was intended to be. You pass the entire afternoon laughing yourself silly in air-conditioned comfort to escape the summer heat, then go home and forget all about it. Then you go to another theater featuring a different double feature the following afternoon for another silly ride.",,Anonymous,Horror
"""I Never Miss...""","The double feature presentation is amazing. Both films were purposely filmed with low quality clarity to give it more of an old time look. They were also filmed to portray an actual double feature feel. They had some previews and things like that for other movies (not real ones) before they started, and between them.Planet Terror was the first film. It was about a certain military division deploying an infectious gas. Some people were immune to it, and they were the ones that had to fight it off. There were tons of ridicules little quips that were really funny. It was also filled with ridicules things happening that normally would never happen. Really no different than any other Robert Rodriguez film. He basically takes everything that can happen, and puts an exclamation point on the end of them. It was very gory, and I loved it.Death Proof was the second film. It was about a retired stuntman who, for some reason, has a very interesting definition of entertainment. This one had the best/craziest car chase scene I've ever seen, and I can almost guarantee it was the best/craziest one ever filmed. It was VERY entertaining.This double feature was strictly filmed for entertainment purposes. The dialog, and previews of coming attractions, and the camera shots were written to be offensive and shocking, as well as ridicules and funny. If you like to be entertained, and are the kind of person who doesn't take offense to much, this one's for you. I loved it!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sadly Lame Considering Their Past Work,"Don't pay any money to see Grindhouse - if you're a Rodriguez or Tarantino fan - get a copy or download one if you want to follow their work. Both their efforts are over-the-hill lame offerings, and while they basically fit the retro genre targeted, are slim offerings, and may actually irritate fans of the genre, as they poor in comparison with the films they have tried to emulate - especially Tarantino's Death Proof. The trailers for the non-existent ""coming attractions"" are also lame and sophomoric - you can probably get as much laughs from amateur works shown on UTube. A great scene would be Rodriguez and Tarantino walking down a street - patting each other on the back for the crud they've foisted on us this time - and then a pack of angry zombie Nazi Hillary Clinton clones from Planet X kicking their asses, and then refusing to drink such thin useless blood....",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Two Films, One Glorious Guilty Pleasure Experience","There was one image, above all, that made me want to see this film, Rose McGowan and her assault weapon leg. Now Grindhouse films have been back already (Wolf Creek, Tourista, High Tension, etc). So Tarantino and Rodriquez set up to honor the fabulous Z films of the 60's and 70's and they honor those films well. It starts out with Planet Terror which is about a town turning into zombies by the release of a mysterious gas from a nearby army base. The film is fast pace, action pack and so over the top gleeful that you sit smiling the entire time and trust me, there are some just shocking moments that you can't help but react. Freddy Rodriquez (from Six Feet Under) is fantastic in this film and Robert R does not pull any punches. His half of Grindhouse is outstanding from beginning to end. Next we have Death Proof, Tarantino's half. Its a bit slow at the beginning because you just want to get to the action. I think the purpose of all this setup is so you can care for the characters. Kurt Russell plays Stuntman Mike, a drifter/outsider with one heck of a car. Now this isn't giving anything away. He seems nice but he turns, oh how he turns. This is in tribute to those films where you meet a very helpful nice stranger and take there offer and you end of regretting it through the rest of the film. Overall I give this film an 8 out of 10. Tarantino film is a bit of a letdown after planet terror (until the end of Tarantino's film). The movie also feature at least two fake trailers done by other directors, friends of Rodriquez and Tarantino and I can tellyou, if they WERE actual films, I would see them. Grindhouse films were those made by second-tier directors who were outside of Hollywood and just had a camera some friends and a little money. Is this film art, no way, but it sure is enjoyable and I can tell you, IT IS NOT, I repeat, NOT for everyone. DO NOT TAKE ANY CHILDREN TO THIS FILM. I cannot stressed this enough. Now if you are under 17... and you can't get in... you may have to do some parental negotiation. I say that, at the very least, you have to be in highschool to see this film. Anyone under 15 have to wait. I mean, it's not even appropriate for adults with certain sensibilities. And for you men out there, know your wives and girlfriends before taking them. Otherwise you will have to profusely apologize and may have to take them to the next 10 chick flicks. But if you must take them, the price to pay is soooo worth it. Zombies, weapon legs, nudity, disgusting images.. all worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
passable,"""Grindhouse"" has some banality moments but they're certainly outnumbered by a doze of pleasant and unusual entertainment -and humor as well); this movie shows Quentin Tarantino's marketing, experience, packaging and it does work, in spite of the low budget. Acttresses and actors look very experienced, despite their being so young, so the viewers is in good hands, never getting bored or tired. Must say the the director takes the risk of being too ""self referential"" but the result is something energetic and unusual (as usual in this kind of movie). not the best film of 2007 but certainly worth the price paid for the ticket.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Grindhouse delivers everything it promised and then some. Please, when you see this movie ( and you will see this movie) just try to laugh at least once, because it is quite funny.As far as the action goes, Planet Terror was filled from start to finish so get ready for one crazy ride.In Death Proof you may think that it is boring, but please don't. Like any Tarantino movie, it starts with great dialog, THEN moves into action. Just think of it as a break from the action.OK, so I am ranting at this point and I realize this, but only because this movie is that good.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great concept, dragged down by QT","In Grindhouse Tarrantino and Rodriguez pair up to make some of the crazy camp that they served with From Dusk 'Til Dawn. Rodriguez's Planet Terror is an instant classic: gory, ridiculous and plenty of great moments. Tarrantino's Death Proof is simply boring, self-indulgent and drags down the whole Grindhouse with it. Any of the fake trailers pack a million times more entertainment than Death Proof (inexplicably, critics decided Death Proof was the best part). Rodriguez is finally capturing the lost opportunities he had in Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Sin City and looks like he's finally using the best of his talent. Tarrantino on the other hand, does a poorly-written dialog rehash of his other films interrupted briefly by some action sequences and the result is plain horrible. Too bad this happened, because the concept is great, the trailers are amazing (I'd love to see Machete if it ever gets done) and if the whole thing would've succeeded, we could be seeing a Grindhouse 2 directed by Rob Zombie and Eli Roth. Unfortunately Tarrantino's flop ruined it and Grindhouse bombed.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Sex, action, blood, guts and fast cars, Grindhouse has it all and then some","People loved to be scared. I don't know what's the fascination of it all but it's true. I don't mind paying 10 to 11 dollars to lose a night of sleep. But horror films don't do that to me anymore but instead gross me out. It's cool but I'd like to see the horror genre get back to basics. Grindhouse, the latest effort by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, while not as scary fails to disappoint. One of the reasons I decided to go see this film was because of the way it was presented. Grindhouse is an homage to the old double features in the 60-70's and includes everything associated with them (missing reels, grainy presentation, fake trailers and etc.) The first of the two films was Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"". This one was about infections that has turned all of the towns citizens into zombies. We also get to meet the main characters Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan), a stripper equipped with a gun for a right leg (long story, you'd have to see the movie), and El Rey (Freddy Rodriguez). The last film was Tarantino's ""Death Proof"", which is about a former stuntman (Kurt Russell) who gets kicks out of stalking young ladies and killing them. However, I left the theater torn between which one of the double features I enjoyed. In ""Terror"", Rodriguez gave us a somewhat satirical look at 70's horror films (where 2006's Slither miserably failed) from the camera angles down to the John Carpenter-esquire film score. Whereas ""Proof"" is typical Tarantino. It's very chatty and not as fast paced as ""Terror"", until much later, but easily enjoyable. Grindhouse clocks in at 3 hours and 11 minutes but it never slows down to the point that you can fall asleep. Grindhouse also delivers some well needed originality as far as today's horror films go. It's not only my favorite film of the year, so far, but one of my favorite films period.Grindhouse - ***1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Death Proof brings the whole thing down,"Okay, let me cut to the chase: Planet Terror was really entertaining, and the trailers were great. But Death Proof might just be the worst film I've EVER seen. Wow. I just cannot believe it.Basically, Death Proof brings down what could have been a solid rating of 6 or 7 to a 1. It's THAT bad. Words don't do it justice. Here's a film where NOTHING happens, offering a startling opposite to Rodriguez's entertaining first half. I mean, it's ALL talking and shots of cars hitting each other. There is no suspense, there is no humor (well, there is no humor that is actually funny), there is no entertainment value whatsoever. Anyone who is a fan of Tarantino's dialog will even be disappointed: it's mainly just annoying chicks yapping about weed and men in this film.One has to wonder what Tarantino was going for in this film. Was he just trying to alienate his fanbase? Was he trying to offer a too-true version of what a grind house film is (because, despite all the classic titles, many grind house films were boring crap)? Was he hanging around Eli Roth too much? Or did he actually think people would find this entertaining? It's hard to say.I respect Rodrigeuz's and Tarantino's film vision, and I can tell their intentions were true. But nothing can hide the fact that Tarantino's film is easily the worst thing I've ever seen. I'm a huge exploitation/horror fan, I'm a big Tarantino fan, but this was just TERRIBLE. No matter how I look at it, it's just really bad -- and not in a good way. My advice? Stay until the entertaining trailer for Thanksgiving and then leave.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Muscle Cars, Severed Limbs and Badass Cinema","Greetings again from the darkness. The much anticipated quasi-collaboration between Tarantino and Rodriguez delivers everything we could have hoped for. The ""Double Feature"" replete with shocking trailers for non-existent movie is almost as fun to watch as it probably was for the cinema bad boys to make. The best warning I can give is that some boys have toys like chemistry sets and toy trains. QT and RR have their movie cameras. This is a fantasy camp production for two lucky guys who get to live their dream in their own world.The first feature is the Rodriguez zombie flick. It is actually much better than expected and advertised. Rose McGowan is outstanding is the go-go dancer (not stripper - ""there's a difference"") who loses a leg in a most unfortunate manner. Her boyfriend, played by the up and coming Freddy Rodriguez, sweetly provides her a new leg - a machine gun that later morphs into a Gatling gun. How's a guy supposed to compete with that? Sure the story is a bit weak, but who really cares? The action is non-stop and the mandatory gross out stuff is in abundance from the likes of Josh Brolin, Jeff Fahey, Marly Shelton, Stacy Ferguson (Black-Eyed Peas), Naveen Andrews (""Lost"") and Michael Biehn. I would never give away anything here but will say, it is the most fun one can have in a zombie flick! Second feature belongs to Tarantino and includes everything you would expect delivered in ways you could never expect! Kurt Russell, as ""Stuntman Mike"" plays the oddest bad boy in a muscle car that I have ever witnessed on screen. For extra enjoyment, remind yourself that this guy got his start in Disney films!! He has a knack for getting rid of obnoxious girls in the most violent of manners. The best filmed segment of the film is in the diner as four ladies loudly do the chick thing by yakking non-stop. The camera moves totally around the table getting views from every angle and occasionally catching Russell in the background. Brilliant. Real life stunt woman Zoe Bell is amazing in her role as a stunt woman who is always looking for that thrill in life ... this time in the form of a Dodge Challenger! The whole car chase sequence is unlike any we have seen before and QT adds a bit of humor and statement when the classic muscle cars go weaving in and out of traffic full of SUV's and 4 door sedans. Yesterday meets today ... and today looks pretty lame. The downside to this story is that Rosario Dawson is basically awful. Still not enough to take the edge or fun out of this Tarantino buffet of badass cinema.The faux-trailers are very well made and very funny by directors such as Eli Roth, Rob Zombie and Edgar Wright. Especially funny is Wright's ""Don't"". Interesting acting notes include double dipping roles (both films) for Rose McGowan, Marley Shelton, Michael Parks and Tarantino (who has extended screen time). Also Bruce Willis, Nicolas Cage and Danny Trejo make appearances, as does the great Sydney Poitier's daughter, Sydney Tamiia Poitier.Not in the classic film sense of ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Kill Bill"", but hugely entertaining and funny. There are so many inside jokes here it may take 10 viewings to catch them all. One of the best is the ""missing reel"" announcement just as the sex scenes get started. All of the stuttering, skipping, poor editing and black outs really did happen back in the day. We forget just how lucky we are ... both for film quality and to experience the madness of Tarantino and Rodriguez.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Tarantino to Rodriguez: Who's your Daddy?????,"GRINDHOUSE 2007 (Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez, Kurt Russell, Rosario Dawson) DIRECTED BY: ROBERT RODRIGUEZ and QUENTIN Tarantino ~ THE RUNDOWN: Overall, GRINDHOUSE is a fun and worthy venture, but definitely uneven. ~ The concept is great, and one can't help but admire the innovation and originality of the project as well as the consistent attention to detail. For example, the purposely-inflicted grimy look of the film and the missing reel parts were fun, even though a little cheap and a little distracting. Then again, in PLANET TERROR's case, the occasional distraction was usually far more entertaining than the movie. In fact, all the trailers were too. Now, don't get me wrong, Rodriguez is a good filmmaker and I like a lot of his stuff, but there simply wasn't anything above mediocrity involved with his portion of the pie; it was just a tiresome zombie movie. Thinking about it now it really just reminds me of one of those 'Tales from the Crypt' movies they make every few years, and you can't tell me Rodriguez took any longer than a couple days to come up with that entire movie...a movie which, on its own, is worthy of nothing more than some no namers and a straight-to-DVD release at Blockbuster. ~ However, Tarantino is a genius. The guy is simply a genius and kicks ass in every way possible...except for acting, which he's okay at. His naysayers are total dumbas*es who probably adore Braveheart and various Michael Bay productions. His portion here, entitled DEATH PROOF, is much more entertaining than it sounds, showcasing Tarantino's ingenious, unmatched writing skills as well as his ability to orchestrate finely-tuned, edge-of-the-seat actions sequences. Also, Kurt Russell's performance is especially slick and refreshing. DEATH PROOF, by no means, is flawless and not exactly up to Quentin's usual level of amazingness, but I'm cutting it slack because I do believe its potential was constrained a bit by the Rodriguez movie and the general 'Grindhouse' concept; Tarantino's films do, afterall, usually push three hours in length. ~ The hilarious trailers, highlighted by Eli Roth's delightful 'THANKSGIVING', combined with a satisfying ninety-minutes from Tarantino and an intriguing general concept make for a worthy venture to the theatres. Unfortunately, PLANET TERROR basically sucked.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Judge it in it's class,"You can't look at Grindhouse up against Volver or Children of Men. You have to judge it in the same weight class. There you will see a champion. It's a loud, bloody, long homage to the cars, corpses and copulation Z-pictures of the 1970s that captures reverence for the medium that was evident in the original ""grindhouse"" movies, films catering to an unsophisticated audience in an era when mass movie-going was in danger of fading away.It has roots in films such as Rolling Thunder (1977), Dawn of the Dead (1979), Zombi 2 (1979), Rock All Night (1957), and Escape From New York (1981). Robert Rodriguez's gives us a knock-off of Night of the Living Dead with Planet Terror, and Quentin Tarantino champions tough-talking chicks and Dodge Challengers in Death Proof. The former is a much more interesting film, but the latter was excellent, too. The previews of coming attractions added immensely to the film. At least we didn't have to watch previews that were ""suitable for all ages."" Why would previews at an ""R"" rated movie not be ""R"" rated also? Zoe Bell, Kurt Russell, and Rose McGowan are among a cavalcade of stars that include Nickolas cage and Bruce Willis.You go to Grindhouse for the same reasons people went to the original grindhouses visceral action and visceral sex.

"Rose McGowan was the only bright spot, for me","This was a huge disappointment. I like Freddy Rodriguez but he seemed miscast and that caused the whole first segment to sputter in the wrong places. I did enjoy Marley Shelton's and Josh Brolin's performances as a married couple of doctors. And Kurt Russell was appropriately seedy and demented and a good foil for Sydney Tamiia Poitier's Jungle Julia. But the best part, for me, was Rose McGowan's Cherry Darling. What an impossibly gorgeous creature this woman is! And that she was willing to take this part makes me wonder what she's like in person. No way she's dull, as I just assumed she had to be to be in that 'Charmed' TV series.There are good and original and evocative parts of this movie, I particularly liked the well understood Texas flavor of 'Planet Terror', but they're not enough to justify sitting there for 3 hours, in my opinion. There's a nice quality to 'Death Proof' but it's mostly in the girl talk which has limited appeal for guys. And who would dare promise a lap dance from Jungle Julia and then renege on the deal?",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Welcome to the grindhouse! (No spoilers, little bias(?!))","Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino team up to produce this true-to-form recreation of the classic grindhouse experience. That means unbelievable plots, oodles of violence, and sexxxxx. The film is actually a ""double feature"", the first movie by Rodriguez and the second by Tarantino. In between are highly entertaining trailers for fictional B movies. The first film, Planet Terror, contains a convoluted plot that ultimately boils down to small town vs. Zombies, starring a very sexy Rose McGowan. Filled with hilariously disgusting moments, purposefully missing what could have been its best scene (""missing"" reel), and littered with just plain over the top dialogue, Rodriguez put together a highly entertaining zombie-fest. The film strays a little bit from its grindhouse roots, feeling more parody than true-to-genre, but its great fun. The second film, Death Proof, feels much more grindhouse. The plot builds slowly as we are introduced to a group of three young women, whose pot-smoking and partying are of shockingly sinister interest to one Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell). Death Proof is not nearly as action packed as the Rodriguez pic, taking a bit too much time to build, but it does feature fun (and long!) car chases and plenty o'tits and attitude. As a whole, Grindhouse is a success: a faithful recreation of the grindhouse experience in the most perverse, entertaining sense. See it in the theatre. ***/4 stars",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Camp b ...but I do like it...,"All right.. I know how fashionable it is to love these two, and with reason.. BUT just to put it in a reasonable light....

The Graceland of Movies,"Let me explain that. Elvis' Graceland mansion is a clear example of white trash striking it rich. Grindhouse is 70s B-Movie Fanboys strike it rich and get to do all the ""over the top"" effects they've always wanted. OK, and before we go on, if I never hear ""cheezy"" ""B-Movie"" ""over the top"" or ""gratutious"" again, I might be happy. These words are appropriate here but they're as overdone as the greaser guys hanging out at rockabilly clubs. It's also strange to do a tribute to that ""genre"" since the words used to describe super gory, ""over the top"" Grindhouse type movies have long been excuses for bad writing or a half-assed idea. Just add more explosions! Kind of like a comic who adds f-bombs and n-words.The movies themselves are fun; Planet Terror being the better of the two. Death Proof is just a lot of talking with some car chases. It feels like what a Quentin Tarantino fan would make in film school. Unlike Pulp Fiction, which threw out tasty nuggets of trivia and strange conversation, Death Proof is just people taking a long time to say something.No real new ideas here or super-clever humor. Just a rehashing of old movies with a wink so you know they're in on the joke too...which ironically makes these movies sincere tributes. If you are a film school nerd or are like Quentin Tarantino and sat in your basement pleasing yourself to crappy movies in the 70s OR you missed all of that but really like explosions and naked chicks and car chases, hey, this movie is for you. It's gaudy. It's a rehash but unique to current movies, which makes the movie ironic at it's core. And Rose McGowan has a gun for a leg, so that's neat. It's not bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rodriguez and Tarantino: Feel the Genius,"I have just returned from seeing ""Grindhouse."" My heart is still racing so much, I just don't know where to begin. First, let me say that my only disappointment had nothing to do with the film itself. Rather, it was the fact that there were so few people in the audience. Even though the film received favorable reviews, its opening weekend return was considered a disappointment. What a shame. (Especially when one notices that the big grosser was, again, ""Blades of Glory"" ...BE FOR REAL!) I am happy to see that so many of the other reviewers regarded this film as more than just a movie, but instead as an experience. Folks, that's what this film is all about: NOT SIMPLY WATCHING A MOVIE, BUT EXPERIENCING IT. There are so few films out there these days that actually invite an audience to do that. Now, I'm not suggesting that ""Grindhouse"" needs mainstream acceptance for validation. My point is that art of this magnitude should be witnessed and shared by as many as possible. The film itself? I'd rather you go see it to feel the genius of Rodriguez and Tarantino. Here are two master filmmakers doing what they do best, and, not coincidentally, doing it better than any other writers/directors out there today. What do they do? It's not only about exceeding audience expectations, it's about SUBVERTING them. It is true that this film invokes the ""moviehouse"" feel of the 1970's (for me, it was a return trip to the world of mid-70's drive-ins), but the two directors take that cinema experience and create a new cinematic juggernaut that grips you from the very start and will not turn you loose, until it has turned you every which but loose. NOTE: To all those waiting for ""Grindhouse"" to come to DVD or for some criminally bad bootleg: YOU WON""T GET THE FULL EXPERIENCE OF THIS MOVIE SITTING AT HOME NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF HOME THEATRE YOU HAVE OR HOW BIG THE SCREEN. The only screen big enough is the one at the theatre. For the fans that really dig this movie, SPREAD THE WORD! It's not too late to make this a huge sleeper hit. The talent in front of and behind the camera should not be neglected. Excuse my gushing, but I haven't been this hyped about a film in quite some time, and I see no less than 150 films a year. Everything works in this movie: the acting, the writing (no one is better at using dialogue for character development than Tarantino), the soundtrack. . .I could go on, but I won't. Just this: Catch this movie the way it was meant to be seen, on the big screen. ""Grindhouse"" is neither parody nor spoof, yet more than just nostalgia or even homage. It's the movie to see this year. I can't wait to see it again in a couple of days.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"GRINDHOUSE (Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, 2007)	***","Yesterday's whining about missing out on these discussions proved premature, because I eventually managed to get hold of a DivX copy of the film in a matter of hours! It may not be the ideal medium to fully appreciate the GRINDHOUSE experience  especially in view of the cropped picture and muffled audio  but, for the moment, it was enough to tide me over; at least, I was able to get an inkling of what the film is like since, as I said before, there's no announced local release date as yet.Anyway, I have to say that on the whole I was underwhelmed by it all: like Joe Karlosi, individually I'd rate the Rodriguez segment **1/2 and Tarantino's ***. Still, I'm sure it's better to watch them as a double-feature because neither of the two parts really add up to much on their own. After all, that is the whole nostalgic spirit of grindhouse it is trying to celebrate complete with cheesy trailers, two 90 minute B-movies back-to-back, scratched prints, audio drop-outs, missing reels, etc. I have only watched a handful of grindhouse movies myself  4 of which were introduced by Tarantino himself (together with Joe Dante) during a marathon midnight screening at the 2004 Venice Film Festival.To get to the film(s) proper now: I've watched little of Robert Rodriguez's movies so far and I wasn't that much taken by them and his ""Planet Terror"" is an extremely gory zombie flick which, as mindlessly enjoyable as it is while it's on, essentially brings nothing new to the table. It's as much a virtual retread of his own FROM DUSK TILL DAWN (1996) as a nod to the zombie films of George Romero, Lucio Fulci et al. The cast is a mix of young actors and grindhouse/action-movie veterans: Rose McGowan is ideally cast as the heroine who finds inspired use for her leg when it's amputated after being bitten off and Marley Shelton leaves a good impression as a harassed needle-sporting doctor  but then Freddy Rodriguez is a non-entity as McGowan's ex-boyfriend; the rest include Josh Brolin as Shelton's crazed surgeon husband, Tom Savini as a distraught cop, Michael Biehn as his superior, Jeff Fahey as a bartender, Michael Parks (reprising his sheriff role from the KILL BILL [2003/4] films!), Bruce Willis as a shady military official and Tarantino himself (who keeps inflicting his imaginary thespian skills on moviegoers despite the resulting sabotage of his appearances) as an obnoxious orderly of Willis'so his stomach-turning demise was particularly welcome!Quentin ""Look, I'm an artist, alright"" Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" is potentially intriguing: while Rodriguez's aim seems to have been to merely replicate the dumb thrills of typical grindhouse efforts, Tarantino's segment  frustrating though it is  comes off more like a reflection on this particular style of film-making (and the road movie/car chase variety in particular), with little plot and a lot of mood-setting. But, unfortunately, Tarantino is too much in love with his own dialogue and there are reams of utterly uninteresting chick chatter between the two sets of girls which makes for a rather dull ride (no pun intended) and I pretty much gave up on listening to the actual banter after vainly trying to sort out any substance from all the expletives! Some of the girls (Vanessa Ferlito and Sydney Tamiia Poitier) look good, thankfully, but I have to ask what they were doing mouthing off would-be hip references to cult 'car' films of the 1970s or wondering what turn Pete Townshend's career would have taken had he left The Who?! All of which makes Tarantino's claims that ""Death Proof"" contains his best dialogue exchanges ever and that he is in the same league as Preston Sturges and Mark Twain as a writer ludicrously egomaniacal. Luckily, Kurt Russell is on hand to lend some much-needed gravitas to the proceedings; interestingly, his character goes through quite a surprising change throughout the course of ""Death Proof"" (and I agree wholeheartedly with Michael Elliott that the two halves of this section actually happened in reverse). However, where this segment really scores is in the action sequences  alternately shocking (the repeated collision sequence and McGowan's vicious murder), thrilling (the car chase) and crowd-pleasing (Russell's come-uppance) rather than merely pure slam-bang as in ""Planet Terror"" (in spite of all its purposeful political incorrectness) - which really elevates Tarantino's piece above that of Rodriguez. Having said that, it's still not quite up to the level of his earlier work (for instance, the KILL BILL saga  which is the closest to it in feel and approach  is much better) and I'd say this is Tarantino's weakest effort to date.In conclusion, another head-scratcher for me was that, in spite of all the admirable effort (mentioned above) on the part of the film-makers to replicate the grindhouse 'feel', the stories themselves were then set in modern-day America (cue the needlessly regular use of CGI effects in Rodriguez's section and that of mobile phones in Tarantino's) which, for me, rather defeated the purpose. The eclectic bunch of trailers (contributed by Eli Roth, Edgar Wright, Rob Zombie and Rodriguez himself) are campy fun and an inspired addition to this decidedly mixed bag.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just Go See It,"It's Rodriguez and Tarantino combining their talents. What the Hell else do you need to know? Both films are entertaining and will keep you abuzz for hours afterward. I must admit, however, that ""Death Proof"" does move slow at first, but believe me, it is worth the sit. Last, but not least, are the trailers. They will unquestionably remind those who were teenagers when vcr's first arrived, of the cornball horror flicks you'd find in the extra-extra large boxes on the top shelf of the local convenience store rental section. By all means, this movie should not be missed. In my humble opinion, this is some of Tarantino's finest work since Pulp Fiction and, as usual, his soundtrack selection is spectacular!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Best Movie of all Time!,"The name says it all; Grindhouse is a gritty, nasty, hilarious, gory thrill ride, and I loved every minute of it! A nasty, creative, original double feature masterpiece, Grindhouse is the most fun you could ask for at the movies, and it is certainly one of the best, if not the best, horror films ever made. Grindhouse is a 3 ½ hour masterpiece, but it's definitely not for the faint of heart. The movie is filled with some of the nastiest scenes to hit the big screen. Grindhouse consists of 2 movies, one written and directed by Robert Rodriguez (entitled ""Planet Terror""), the other written and directed by Quentin Tarantino (entitled ""Death Proof""), along with four fake trailers from directors Rob Zombie, Eli Roth, and others. The movie is filled with a plethora of sensational actors, including Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez, Bruce Willis, Marley Shelton, Rosario Dawson, Fergie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jordan Ladd, Zoe Bell, Tracie Thoms, and Eli Roth.The first film in the double feature is called ""Planet Terror"", and it mixes quirky characters, hilarious moments, disgusting gross-out scenes, and nasty zombies to make an extremely memorable film.The second film in Grindhouse is called ""Death Proof"", which is filled with realistic dialogue, loads of character development, a hilarious villain, and the best car chase sequences ever in a film.Both of the films are unique in their own way, and each gets across the old idea of the ""Grindhouse"" much differently. After Tarantino and Rodriguez made each of the films, they had to significantly cut out a lot of the material and they ""aged"" the film reels, making them look worn and as if they had suffered from a lot of wear-and-tear. This creates a unique atmosphere and a gritty look that can be neither matched nor compared to any other film that has ever been released. The two directors show gusto and a lot of enthusiasm for the goofy material, and both films are nearly flawless representations of the old ""Grindhouse"" films of the 60's and 70's. Rodriguez's film goes all-out in terms of wacky characters, bizarre situations, and extreme violence and gore, and the campy feel of his film, ""Planet Terror"" is another part of its appeal. It's fast-paced, but still manages to fit in lots of subplots and wonderfully crafted characters. On the other hand, Tarantino has a much different tactic that is, in many ways, much more similar to exploitation films such as Vanishing Point. He provides the viewer with loads of useless dialogue that is actually quite useful in terms of the characters. You feel like you know each and every person in Tarantino's movie, and it really pays off when the bad stuff really starts to happen. Tarantino provides a perfect mood and setting, and he never gives too much backstory on Stuntman Mike as to not make him interesting anymore. Tarantino's movie works on many different levels than Rodriguez's, and it can be interpreted in many various ways.As for the fake trailers, all of them are hysterically funny, and most of them manage to create a real ""feel"" of being in an exploitation theater. In terms of hilarity, gore, and really feeling like a Grindhouse picture, the two trailers that are most effective are Eli Roth's wonderful Thanksgiving trailer and Edgar Wright's gut-wrenchingly funny Don't. The two other trailers, Werewolf Women of the SS by Rob Zombie and Machete by Robert Rodriguez, are certainly no disappointment, but Thanksgiving and Don't seem to accomplish their goals more efficiently.In terms of acting, it is surprisingly thorough, fun, and purposely cheesy. Rose McGowan brings the most realism in both of her roles, as Cherry Darling in ""Planet Terror"" and as Pam in ""Death Proof"". She brings a lot of sympathy and overall coolness to her character that is mostly unmatched. Marley Shelton is unbelievably stunning and beautiful as Dr. Dakota Block in both segments, although her appearance in ""Death Proof"" is very brief. Freddy Rodriguez (no relation to the director) is a major standout in the leading role in Robert Rodriguez's segment ""Planet Terror"". After his remarkable performance in HBO's Six Feet Under, Rodriguez proves that he can carry an entire movie on his shoulders, and he does so quite smoothly. He seems to be a natural leader, and his brings an unbelievable level of suave to his role as El Wray. Bruce Willis is quite the scene-stealer in ""Planet Terror"", and he plays the role with his usual level of expertise. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays against type as a dumb-as-tacks brunette in ""Death Proof"", and she is great in her role. Tracie Thoms, after her fantastic performance in Rent, is hilarious as Kim in ""Death Proof"", and Zoe Bell and Rosario Dawson are both sensational. Eli Roth proves he can act in ""Death Proof"", and he also shows off his acting chops in his spectacular trailer for Thanksgiving. The real star of ""Death Proof"", however, is the role of Stuntman Mike himself, performed with unmatched talent by the great Kurt Russell. Russell provides everything that makes the character of Stuntman Mike so memorablean air of menace, a specific deliverance of his lines, a powerful amount of emotion and craziness. Stuntman Mike becomes an insanely memorable slasher character thanks to the remarkable performance from Kurt Russell.Both ""Planet Terror"" and ""Death Proof"" end up as each filmmaker's best movie. Rodriguez reinvents the zombie genre with crazy characters and a previously unseen level of vigor. Tarantino provides a new take on a slasher film that is both nasty and amazingly well-done. Grindhouse could quite possibly be the best film ever made in the history of cinema, and it even managed to top this year's sensational 300 on every level imaginable. Grindhouse is already being called a cult classic, and for a good reason. Don't miss Grindhouse under any circumstances, and definitely don't miss ""Death Proof"" or any of the fake trailers.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horrible...,"If you consider your life meaningful then don't see this movie. Not only was it not entertaining is was so damn long. Both films were intended to be B films, however, they were just bad films all together. No thought was put into either of them. The only plus was the fake previews for movies that'll never be made in between the films. I wanted my $9 back after this film. Most people seemed to like this film, but I feel it was a waste of time and money. I totally dig both directors work. However this was just lacking in so many areas. No plot, horrible acting, you name it. The most disappointing thing was how many actors that came into this film. They must have had a lot of respect for the directors because their performances all sucked throughout this entire picture. Save yourself and don't see this film.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Great, gory old school fun!",I really enjoyed this movie. I don't want to give away anything but will say that they really did a great job on this. Don't let the 3 1/2 hr. running time intimidate you. It is well worth it and so much fun. The previews they had made for this are so funny as well. Tarantino's movie has that old school feeling like movies used to without all the cheesy C.G. And Planet Terror was a fun ride. Go see it!!!It is a one of a kind movie that has needed to be made for years. Also I really hope they would consider making something ridiculous like Machete because I would def. go see it as would many others I imagine. Enjoy!,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Big Trouble in Little China tribute in Grindhouse,"Sorry if it has been posted before...but in the bar during ""Death Proof"" Jack Burton's (Big Trouble in Little China) tank top is tacked up on the wall...it is visible for much of the scenes in the bar.cheers -raindog from ""raindog's rants""Raindog's 10 favorite things in Grindhouse:1. Jack Burton's (Big Trouble in Little China) Tank Top tacked up to the bar the girls hang out in during Tarantino's Death Proof. ..I own this shirt. I loved that movie.2. The B-movie actors throughout both filmsthe best has to be Buffalo's own Jeff Fahey as J.T. in Planet Terror. This is his best role since The Lawnmower Man for f*ck's sake.3. A Tom Savini-like SE romp through the playground of Planet Terrorhands-down some honest-to-god grindhouse gore which is exceedingly rare in the days of CGI. The movie is bloody, disgusting, old-school goodness. And Savini's in it!4. Kurt F*cking Russell back where he should have been all along. If this sentence makes no sense to yougo out and rent The Thing (1982), Big Trouble in Little China (1986), and the coup de grâce: Escape From NY (1981). I'd let you borrow them, but I don't lend out my dvds.5. Eli Roth's ""preview"" for the ""film"" Thanksgiving between the two features. I laughed hard with delight and glee and, I think, surprised Frymaster with my reaction a little bit.6. Planet Terror. Rodriguez gets it right in all the right spots. It is truly a tribute to all those great movies of the 70s and early 80s that I know Frymaster wants to come over and look through now that he's realized he might actually like them. Planet Terror even gets the dialogue right: ""That boy's got the devil in him.""7. Vanessa Ferlito as Butterfly in Death Proof (where the hell is the lap dance scene?!)8. The girls.9. The car. Nova. Chevy. 1972.10. Michael Parks reprises his character of Earl McGraw (from Kill Bill) I think this character should be in every Tarantino film from now on.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
You have to be tuned into this one in order to enjoy it.,"This movie (or movies) is an odd beast. There does not seem to be an obvious (to me at least) ""point"" to it, so everyone looking for a message or closure will likely not get much enjoyment out of this one. Neither will those that insist on a tight narrative, or complex character studies. That's just not what this is.But what is it? Maybe it's like Kill Bill, but without the plot. It's a lot of action, a lot of self-aware and reflective toying with genres and viewer expectations, a lot of violence and gore, a lot of references, and a thimble-full of plot and characters. That's kind of what this is. Twice. With trailers.And, of course, it's done very, very well. Technically and artistically. It's original, inventive, visually striking, funny, gross, exciting, sexy, etc. etc.But is it good? That is, as always, in the eye of the beholder, but it seems to be even more true for this work than for most others. I loved it, chuckled, laughed hard, indulged in the visuals, and basically enjoyed this the way I would enjoy a roller coaster: you never know what's around the corner or past the dip, but you are prepared to have fun with it whatever it may be.My company did not. I suppose if you tend to sit in a movie with specific expectations, whatever they may be in this case, and measure the movie by the degree to which it manages to fulfill them, you are bound to be disappointed by ¨Grindhouse¨. Oddly, I find it difficult to say that it is a ¨good movie¨, not so much because it isn't good, but because it really isn't a ¨movie¨ the way a roller coaster ride is not transportation---it kinda is, but transportation is not the point.So I guess that's really the best way I know how to describe it---as a cinematic roller coaster ride. If you are in the mood for something like that, go and enjoy, otherwise maybe not.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another great picture (pictures) from Rodriguez and Tarantino,"""Grindhouse"" is the utterly off-the-wall visceral experience that viewers have come to expect from directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino.There is plenty of blood, guts, and gore and don't forget the blatant exploitation of women and minorities. ""Grindhouse"" has everything that a film paying homage to 1970's drive-in B-horror movies requires.""Grindhouse"" is a horror movie double feature. The first film is ""Planet Terror"" directed by Rodriguez. The film is about a military team who accidentally releases a toxic gas into the air of Texas. This gas just happens to turn everyone in the town into zombies. Residents of the town, especially El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez), Cherry (Rose McGowan), and Sheriff Hague (Michael Biehn), must stick together and try to survive this zombie nightmare.By the way I'm so happy to see Biehn back on the screen. Even though he is the most typecast actor I have ever seen. Seriously, go to IMDb.com and look him up. You will be hard-pressed to find a film where he does not play a police or military officer. He is so good at it though, and he has played those parts in some great modern classics.In between the two films are three fake trailers made by other horror directors including, Rob Zombie (The Devils Rejects), Eli Roth (Hostel), and Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead). These trailers are hysterical. They do such a fine job by poking fun at trailers for movies that you probably would not see because they look so goofy. Honestly, one of them is called ""Werewolf Women of the S.S."" Hilarious.The last film is Tarantino's ""Death Proof."" This film is about two groups of girls that are terrorized by a stunt car driver. The driver, Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), has some unknown vendetta against these girls and attempts to kill them with his death proof stunt car. This film is the only weak point of ""Grindhouse."" The double feature opens with an explosion then slows down to a crawl; never bringing you back to the same point of excitement.Tarantino has always been known for having films that are driven by witty and clever dialogue, but this causes ""Death Proof"" to be a slowly unwinding movie. After the non-stop thrills in ""Planet Terror,"" ""Death Proof"" pales in comparison. It is like going to a concert and having a heavy-metal band open up for jazz band. The viewer gets revved up in the first movie only to be slowed down for a smooth, cool second film. The order of the movies should have been reversed.""Grindhouse"" ultimately suffers from the abrupt change of pace. Rodriguez and Tarantino even dirtied the picture quality in order to give all the films an aged and well-worn visual look. Plus, I enjoyed how the theater even put a flier on the entrance on the specific ""Grindhouse"" entrance doors telling all patrons that the film is supposed to look that way so don't go and complain to them.The directors even went as far as to leave out missing reels from the films so a part from each movie is missing. These reels are conveniently left out at the sexually exploitative parts, so even though they are paying homage to the classic films, ""Grindhouse"" does not become exploitative itself.Be forewarned, ""Grindhouse"" literally is a movie double feature. Expect the length of two movies combined together with some trailers because this film clocks in at about three hours and 15 minutes. This is time well spent though, as ""Grindhouse"" is a roller-coaster ride of pure gruesome fun and humor.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
You Have To See This movie!,"I've been waiting for this movie for over a year now, just the thought of a double feature directed by two of the greatest writers/directors alive today (lets try and forget Spy Kids) Then the cast was perfect everything was set in place for this movie to be a HUGE HIT. I wanted to go see this movie opening weekend, but due to my work schedule I had to wait until the following week. Come Monday I looked at the trades and Grindhouse only made 11 million! Now something must have been wrong, was the movie bad? No that couldn't have been, it has been getting rave reviews ever since it was shown to critics and people. So I had to go myself and I decided to bring my girlfriend who seems to get dragged to every movie I want to see. Some are good, some are pieces of crap *cough* Wild Hogs *cough* Well let me just say it now Grindhouse was the best movie I've seen this year, and I've seen quite a few including some really good ones Reign Over Me and The Lookout, but Grindhouse was the best one yet. You all should go see it and recommend it to friends it is unbelievable that it didn't make more money and a piece of crap movie *cough* Wild Hogs *cough* opens with over 40 million and is about to hit the 200 mark. Now I do not know if movie goers are getting dumber and settling for bad movies but that seems to be that case. I wonder why television is filled with dumb reality shows about a kid going out on a date with an older woman then having to choose which of their daughters he wants to date or celebrities dancing for loads of money. Then I realize that is what Americans want to see, more crap, at movies and on television. I am pleaded you people out their not only go see Grindhouse but do not go and pay for crap anymore, show the studios that you want good movies or else we are going to continue this journey of remakes and bad sequels (excluding spider-man) If the time of 3 hrs and 15 minutes scares you, don't worry it flys by. I am the guy you goes to see one movie and right after walks into another (yes without paying for the second) Why? Because I feel movie prices today are outrageous and you should get your money's worth when you go to the theater. With Grindhouse you will get your money's worth and walk out with a satisfied feeling, few movies provide you with these days. I know the trailers didn't give much away and maybe thats why you did not go and see the movies, but trust me they are both great flicks. I was hoping this movie would succeed in America and we would see the old double feature movies comeback to cinemas but it seems America cannot handle good movies combined into one ticket these days. Now the Weinstein's say that they are ""incredibly disappointed"" box office for Grindhouse that they are considering abandoning the double feature as a single feature concept and re-releasing the Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez movie around the U.S. ""in a couple of weeks"" as two separate feature-length movies with additional footage put in.Now I hope you read this go see the movies and recommend it to friends, there is still time go save it from being dumb downed for Americans to go and see it. Get out there and see ""Grindhouse"". Before you have to pay ""twice"" to see the same movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Auteur vs Amateur,"Cult favorites, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez are not talkers; they are doers. If they want to recreate exploitation films popularized in the 1970's for today's masses, they don't just hang around talking about how cool they would be if they did something like that; they do it. GRINDHOUSE packs more blood, boobs and banalities than you can shake a severed limb at into two feature-length films that run back to back. Despite being packaged as two films from the same genre, Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" and Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" offer very different approaches in their homage to excessive sex, violence and gore. One throws story to the blood-soaked floor and spits on it, cluttering the screen with an abundance of characters, sub-plots, political insinuations and zombies galore. The other is all about fast cars and even faster talking women. Both films were aged to simulate the feel of the ""Grindhouse"" era, complete with added dust and scratches as well as missing reels thrown in for authenticity. And after three hours of vain indulgence, neither film rises above its flaws to become the ultimate cheesy experience it both should and could be.Up first is Rodriguez's zombie flick, ""Terror Planet"". It isn't fair to criticize a ""Grindhouse"" film for it's plot, even less so in the case of a zombie movie. Regardless, Rodriguez crams so many people and plights into this fright film that the focus is mostly scattered, at times so much so that it takes away from the impending onslaught of zombies bent on taking over humanity. The acting is often horrible; the scenarios are often ludicrous. Ordinarily, this would be the downfall of any film but here it is expected. It is functional for the most part, good for some laughs, groans and nausea, but the fun that Rodriguez is clearly trying to have is often stunted by his efforts to be loyal to the genre. There is so much time spent attempting to recreate a long forgotten feel, that the action is left floundering. His own talent as a filmmaker further undermines Rodriguez's mimicry of style. The careful framing and calculated composition is often too good to be believable as the B-movie the style is structuring the film to be. Still, Rodriguez deserves praise simply for casting Tarantino himself as a biochemically infected soldier, finding the perfect role for Quentin's unique acting style. And by unique, I mean bad.The moment ""Death Proof"" begins, Tarantino puts Rodriguez to shame. Applying similar visual effects to the film stock, Quentin has crafted a modern take on the ""Grindhouse"" style rather than attempt a film that feels it was taken from the era. The result is a smoother, more sophisticated aesthetic that is only further strengthened by social implications. ""Death Proof"" tells the tale of Stunt Man Mike (an energized and exciting Kurt Russell) and his fetish for killing beautiful babes in high-speed collisions. The ladies he targets are nowhere near helpless. In fact, they are strong and smart, if not somewhat naïve. Tarantino's genius shines through his approach to showcase female empowerment in a genre designed to rob them of all power as well bring the filmmaker's own perverse gaze to light in the eyes of his antagonist. Just like Rodriguez though, Tarantino trips his own pace. He does so by over- indulging the sound of his written word. One too many dialogue-heavy scenes slows the chase to a dangerously boring speed. The girls (Rose McGowan, Rosario Dawson, etc.) wrap their luscious lips around Tarantino's snappy quips but this is the last thing you want when you've already been watching for over two and a half hours. A drag race movie should never drag.GRINDHOUSE can be a lot of fun when it isn't taking itself so seriously. It is broken up by hilarious mock previews, again crafted to fit the period, by directors like Eli Roth (HOSTEL) and Rob Zombie (HOUSE OF A 1000 CORPSES), arguably a director making modern day ""Grindhouse"" pictures without going out of his way to label them as such. The features themselves though are then bogged down by auteurs trying to be amateurs. In fact, it might have actually been more fun if two such meticulous filmmakers weren't at its helm. Perhaps then, it would have actually captured the amateur feel it was designed too. For all its pretentious good intentions, GRINDHOUSE is never neither good nor bad enough to be great.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Pure, Unapologetic, Double Feature Insanity and How I Love It So","I hate most horror films. Predictable, I find them with the typical demon or demon-like killer disposing dumb adolescents with creative fashion that isn't really creative. Thanks but no thanks. I'll stay home. However, give me a horror film where the hunter kills dirty and mean, and the prey fights back dirty and mean, and I'm there.That's what ""Grindhouse"" gives me, being the latest cinematic partnership between Quentin Tarantino (""Pulp Fiction"", ""Kill Bill"") and Robert Rodriquez (the El Mariachi saga, ""Frank Miller's Sin City"") that celebrates the exploitation films of the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s and is a swift, hard and righteous kick to cookie-cutter, assembly line cinema, running at a jumbo 191 minutes (three hours and eleven minutes). Don't complain about the running time.Rodriquez's ""Planet Terror"" is a raw, bloody steak, and you'll need a spine to eat it, after seeing the first mock trailer (later on that one). A deal between mercenaries goes bad, unleashing a deadly virus over a town that kills and turns its citizens into pus-coated, cannibalistic zombies.Our (anti) heroes: ex-solider-cum-grungy auto mechanic El Wray (Freddy Rodriquez of ""Six Feet Under"", no relation to the director) who's the Mexican Jet Li with switchblades; syringe-loving doctor Dakota Block (""Sin City's"" Marley Shelton); the Hague brothers, a hard-boiled sheriff (Mike Biehn of ""Aliens"") and a BBQ-loving cook (Jeff Fahey of ""Silverado""), and go-go dancer Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan of ""Charmed"") who perfectly emotes comic book-like pity and fury when her right leg is ripped from her by zombies but gets a machine rifle to replace the limb. Holy Bruce Campbell and hell hath no fury The bad guys are memorable too, including Bruce Willis's Lt. Muldoon, who wanted me to hum the theme song from ""G.I. Joe: The Animated Series"" because he looked the hero Flint, from the show and toy line, with a three o'clock shadow. Tarnatino's fun as a henchman who can't keep in his pants and gets his (no spoilers!) and you'll remember Josh Brolin (James's son) as Dakota's mean doctor hubby, William Block.After three hysterical trailers spoofs (more on them later), Tarantino delivers ""Death Proof"" like a pizza delivery guy with ten extra cheese pies and a keg of beer. Three gal pals (Vanessa Ferlito; Sydney Tamilla Poitier, daughter of the Oscar legend and Jordan Ladd, Cheryl's kid) go on a road trip for sex, beer, weed, music and guys, but the girls become the targets of a sociopath stunt driver, simply known as Stuntman Mike (a delightfully sinister Kurt Russell), who gets his sexual highs by committing vehicular homicide. He even gets Ms. McGowan (a sweet, blonde hippie chick in this tale) as a victim tease before disposing the other three.However, Mike meets his match in off-duty members of a film crew, played by Rosario Dawson (""Sin City"" ""Clerks 2""), Tracie Thoms (""Cold Case""), who could be the 21st century's Pam Grier and real-life stunt woman Zoe Bell (doubled for Lucy Lawless in ""Xena"" and Uma Thurman in ""Kill Bill""). Their other compeer, the equally sweet, tadpole-like Mary Elizabeth Winstead (""Live Free or Die Hard""), stays behind at a used car seller's home as (again, no spoilers!) while the three test (and stunt) drive the guy's car and collide with Mike (literally), but they get him. Boy howdy, do they get himThe four fake trailers are a pip. Directed by Rodriquez, ""Machete"" (might be a direct-to-DVD film) has his cousin, Danny Trejo, as an illegal Mexican immigrant embroiled in an assassination plot. Look out when he hurls his machete (heh!) if you're a bad guy. Cheech Marin of the comedy duo, ""Cheech and Chong"", has an jaw-dropping part as a gun-toting priest! The other trailers are sandwiched between ""Proof"" and ""Terror""; ""Don't"" is a take on British Gothic horror by Edgar Wright (""Shaun of the Dead"", ""Hot Fuzz""); Turkey Day is a day for killing in ""Thanksgiving"" by Eli Roth (the Hostel films) and Nicholas Cage will shock you as criminal madman Fu Manchu in the self-explanatory ""Werewolf Women of the SS"" by Rob Zombie (""The Devil's Rejects"", the Halloween remake).I don't know if this film will resurrect the double feature (it should), but I know it's a brilliant trip. This cinematic asylum recollects the days when R-rated films were R-rated films. Hell, the film shows (digitally) the wear, tear, bumpiness and missing reel announcements of a film reel that's been put in too many film projectors. There's also ads and bumpers from the past intertwined in the mix.Without any social cowardice, Mr. Rodriquez and Mr. QTarantino have given a beautiful homage to outlaw and madman filmmakers Howard Hawks, John Ford, John Carpenter, George Romero, Sam Raimi (yeah, THAT Sam Raimi), Sergio Leone, Monte Hellman, Peter Yates, Sam Peckinpah, Paul Schrader, Irving Klaw, H.G. Lewis, Ed Wood, Russ Meyer, Andy Sidaris and others I'm not familiar with but otherwise should be.The actors are so game. Thoms and Bell of ""Proof"" should work together again. Should so the maltreated career wise Biehn and Fahey in ""Terror"". Electra and Elena Avellan (sisters of the film's producer, Elizabeth Avellan) are also fun in their brother-in- law's segment as the chatty babysitters of the Blocks's son, Tony (Rebel, one of the director's sons)who ends up...nah, that'd be telling. Even Naveen Andrews (""Lost"") as a scientist in ""Terror"" and Poitier are notable as they meet ugly demises.What more can I say? The film's a mandatory entry in the year's best film list (mine already has ""300"" and TMNT""). If you're a damn prude, don't watch this film and stay home. Read a book. Jog. Make love to yourself. Shame on you, if you wait for the DVD after its' theatrical run. However, if you love movies and watching them in the theater, ""Grindhouse"" is your house.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"2 movies, 2 ratings, spoiler in last paragraph","Rodriguez's feature I rate 4 --- Tarantino's feature I rate 8Rodriguez finds gore amusing, unfortunately the feature had no story to tell, the actors are completely non-compelling, the action was below average, and the storyline had absolutely nothing original. I preferred his first works over his later works. The feature reminded me in many ways of From Dusk til Dawn, which is one of my worst movies ever.Tarantino's great talent is to portray violent death with artistry and originality. He does not fail in this aspect here. However the entire first half of his feature lacked interest. Russel's character is not really explored and the stars of the feature only come into play in the second half of the feature. The result is we get to to know a set of characters, who are artfully killed off, and then they're gone. Then the stars come into the story, and from then on the feature gets much more active and interesting, however coming too quickly to an beautiful boiling point ending which really rocks!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The movie is full of ballsy awesome.,"Flat out amazing awesome fun. Rodriguez and Tarantino capture all the craziness and quirks of the old Grindhouse cinema, and make something new of it. This isn't just some homage or paean, this is taking the tropes and clichés of the genre, and making it something palatable for modern audiences, while remaining true to the spirit of the old b-movies.The trailers are some of the best moments in the movie, but the rest is full of amazingly ballsy action that staples your eyelids to the screen.Planet Terror is non stop action and craziness from start to finish. Rodriguez goes for the jugular and never lets go of your throat the whole time. Its crazy, its unbelievable, its unrealistic - but its totally fun.Death Proof was, to my mind, the stronger of the two. Its a slower build, sure, and full of Tarantino's patented dialogue, but the characters are more engaging, rather that just set pieces for the action, and the story is crazy enough to be scary. PT is gross, over the top, and balls-to-the-wall. Death Proof is slow, methodical, and deadly, much like the main character of Stuntman Mike. Its still plenty of fun, but it takes longer to get to the action, but WHAT action. Zoe Bell is outstanding, and the two big chase sequences at the end are among the best ever filmed.I can't wait until the full length directors cut DVDs come out.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good entertaining schlock movie fare,"Grindhouse is not what I expected it to be, which probably begs the question: what did I expect it to be? Well, I was looking for nearly non-stop action and pacing, combined with snappy Tarantino dialogue and hilarious Rodriguez setups and jokes to boot. The good news is that both films possess these elements to some degree, the bad news are the somewhat boring segments you are forced to sit through while waiting for more ridiculous action, blood, gore and violence. First up on the bill is Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror, a zombie film through and through, though subtly imbued with fresh new ideas in some places. Freddy Rodriguez portrays El Wray, a tough-talking man with a dubious past, who comes across his old flame with a new name, Cherry (Rose Mcgowan), at a barbecue pit. Meanwhile, Abby (Naveen Andrews) accidentally releases a dangerous chemical weapon into the atmosphere, and thus regular Texans start mutating into horrible brain eating zombies, and thus Planet Terror starts following the course of every zombie ever: a lot of people die and a small group of survivors bands together and survives, or doesn't. Yet, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, as Planet Terror does indeed take the zombie movie to the next level in its over-the-topness. There are some really hilarious and somewhat disgusting moments in this movie, which is basically why you're watching it; however, there are also some somewhat slow-paced scenes of pseudo-sentimentality and plot-building that seem rather out of place in a movie that is otherwise filled with exploding heads, brainless heads, headless heads and other such wonders. Ultimately, Planet Terror turns out to be a who's who of stable Rodriguez actors with a few interesting newcomers, and a lot of great zombie killing action mixed with some boring scenes.The tagline for Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof says that ""A New Terror is Coming at 200 mph!"" But it's not so much terror as it is terrible, yet awesomely so. It looks as if ol' Quentin knowingly set out to make a craptacular spectacle of a movie, and if this was indeed his goal, he certainly succeeded. Kurt Russel as Stuntman Mike and two different packs of dizzy dames take center stage here, as Mike stalks the two sets of girls and engages them in trials and tribulations of an automobile nature. The idea of a stalker executing his kills with a car certainly seems like a great fresh take on the slasher genre, but for all I know Tarantino borrowed it directly from an old movie, and there have certainly been highway terrors on film before (Duel anyone?). But, regardless of the origin, the stuntman idea works really well here, allowing for interesting character dynamics and some pretty funny scenes. The dialogue is of course typical Tarantino, chock full of pop culture references and even a few nods to Pulp Fiction. But sadly, given the true nature of this movie, anything happening on screen that isn't high speed highway hijinks just feels lacking, I couldn't shake the feeling of just waiting around for something more interesting to happen.Frankly, the best part of Grindhouse, in my opinion, are the faux-trailers that play in between the two features. Although they're all essentially one-note gags, they don't get old in the two minutes each roughly lasts and thus these trailers provide a hilarious break from some of the monotony of the features. In the end, Grindhouse is by far an entertaining film, and although I eagerly await Tarantino's 5th film, as well as Sin City 2 and the Machete spin-off from Rodriguez, this campy fare fills in nicely for the meantime.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Tale of Two Movies,"It was the best of films it was the worst of films.....Planet Terror - Everything you could ever want from a ""Grindhouse"" film: action, gore, hot babes, explosions, plus the coolest characters and an overly-fantastic plot. My adrenaline was pumping throughout and I couldn't have been more content and satisfied with my ticket purchase.Death Proof - It's like having lunch with my aunt and her ugly friends. This was not Grindhouse at all. The energy that was built up from the A-movie was lost very quickly in this B-movie. I LOVE QT usually, but I can't defend this ISHTAR. This has everything you DON'T want in Grindhouse: ugly women, long-boring conversations, predictability, and characters I care nothing about.Overall, the movie is worth seeing, but I'd highly recommend to everyone just get the DVD of Planet Terror and skip Death Proof altogether.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fun, Fetching, Fetish!","Beyond entertaining! Still dark and disturbing at the same time, so many emotions have been provoked by this treat of a movie. It was a pleasure to reminisce what a disco era movie had to offer, with more appreciation for it after the fact.Eye candy overload! So many hot women, hot situations, hot cars. Adrenaline and fear is still a turn on!They mastered a blend of old and new. The car chase was beefy, the heavy sounds of the muscle car, the jerky bouncy movement was a blaring contrast to the modern day wimpy, light vehicles they bullied off the road.Sexy without stooping to the level of a blatant skin-flick porno. I liked being exposed to an array of fetishes. Things I didn't even think of being erotic, stirred feelings unfamiliar to me.Both features were equally brilliant in their own way, so much so that they didn't compete for my attention.I can go on and on all day long.

"Barrel Of Laughs, They Do It Purely Because They Can!","Let me start of by saying outright, I think Planet Terror was the weaker picture, and Kurt Russel plays a brilliant part in Death Proof! Anyways, Tarantino and Rodriguez literally are a pair of jokers...I found Planet Terror to be rather gruesome and slapstick compared to Death Proof which is much more stylised with the classic Tarantino style dialogue! All in all the two movies compliment each other perfectly, Grindhouse defintiley fulfills what it sets out to accomplish and that is to bring back that classic drive thru cinema era of America by mixing some classic b-movie horror with some bad attitude and a 90's twist.I fully enjoyed Grindhouse however I'm a massive Tarantino fan and knew what to expect, I think the non-beleivers will be like 'What The F**k' at times throughout Planet Terror but I thought it was hilarious.As For Deathproof, this is the real picture, Kurt Russel plays a fantastic part as the psychotic stuntman mike.I think its a long cinema experience as the two movies are as promised: Full Length Features. However if you can hack the uncomfortable seating defintiley bring a girl with you for this one and throw some popcorn at people! An instant classic in my books.I personally wasn't all that impressed with Kill Bill 1 & 2 and this has restored a little faith in Quinten (Who has quick cameo appearances in both Planet Terror and Death Proof) and I just cant wait for Inglorious Bastards, which I hope will be his true comeback! Grindhouse gets an 8 from me!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Great Movie Experience,"'Grindhouse' is two movies in one with fake trailers in between created by movie geniuses Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. With two totally different and twisted plots, 'Grindhouse' puts the thrill of watching movies back to the cinema! So let me start out with the first segment, 'Planet Terror', which was directed by Robert Rodriguez (Sin City, Once upon a Time in Mexico, and many more). It was about a science experiment going bad causing a small town of Texas to be infected with a zombie plague that leads a group of miss-matches together to save the world. The movie stars Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez, Marley Shelton, and Josh Brolin. A great cast for a great film. The film had a talented wide-ranging cast that made the first segment of 'Grindhouse' a great zombie slasher. It had a great score from the director, amazing scenes, and a woman with a high-powered machine for a prosthetic leg. Looks like the fun 70's Grindhouse films are back! 'Planet Terror' is truly an entertaining explosion of thrills.Now let me tell you about the fake trailers in between the movies. They all were full of extreme content from other mastermind directors who brought you good films like Hostel, Cabin Fever, Shaun of the Dead, and so many more. The fake trailers are truly a fun twist to this movie of a lifetime.The next and final segment, 'Death Proof', is from one of Hollywood's greatest directors, Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill Volume 1 and 2, Reservoir Dogs, Dusk Till Dawn, Jackie Brown, and Pulp Fiction). 'Death Proof' is about an aging stuntman who seeks young women to kill, but it is not you're traditional slasher flick, it is slasher Tarantino style. He kills his victims with his car. It features another wide-ranged cast. It stars Zoë Bell, Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Kurt Russell, another terrific cast. 'Death Proof' may have a lot of dialog but it is good dialog. Since Tarantino is known for dialog in his films, this one proves to be no different. The movie also has the best car chase ever seen in cinematic history! The chase scene had NO CGI and Zoë Bell did her own stunts considering she is also a stunt double in real life. 'Death Proof' was a hilarious slasher flick that proves to be no better and no worse than 'Planet Terror'.So like I just said, I can't choose what movie I liked better. They were both great and Grindhouse in all would be nothing without one another, and I am happy to say that finally there is a new cult classic, and its name? Grindhouse.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
didn't live up to the hype.,"i watched this film not sure what to expect. i think i might have enjoyed it more if i had watched it at a drive-in, though. i've always like Rodriguez's's films, but for me, Tarantino's have always been a little harder to like. too talky, too self-reverentially hip and preachy. unfortunately, this double feature fell right along those same lines. while ""planet terror"" was an action-packed and nicely gory zombie flick, ""deathproof"", a stranger-serial-killer-car chase picture was uber boring. just too damn chatty. it could easily have been cut down to half it's length. i found Kurt Russell and Rosario Dawson great in their roles. everyone else? bleh. and what the f*ck happened to their friend they left at the farm? you can tell they had fun making this, and it was fun to spot the cameos, but come on. at no point did i relax and have fun with the idea, which was obviously their goal. overall, the film aging technique was very distracting, as was the gimmicky ""missing reel"" gag. what was that about? i NEVER had that happen when i when to movies in the 70s and 80's. there are enough actual genre films from the time they are trying to pay homage to watch and enjoy without resorting to this.",,Anonymous,Horror
Surprising combination,"I have to make an apology for my voting, as telling the truth, there is no idea about what this movie is going to talk about and why the directors put them together.From the first one - Planet Terror, it is immediately recognised a ""Quentin Tarantino style"". Looking like ridiculous and mess, fulling of disgusting scenes and exaggerated blood plasma blasting. Quentin himself even performed a funny character in the film just like he always did in other movies directed by him.To the second one, actually, I don't like this type of movies. Talking too much junk without any relationship with the main idea the movie wants to express. Too many dirty words, which I don't believe is the style of American speaking. The only thing I like here is the punishment for the murder, and the performance of the Australian girl. The familiar accent made me excited, ""I tell you mate"" this is very lovely, especially spoken by a girl.The last thing I want to tell is a positive comment. It is really worth to watch in the cinema. One ticket, two pictures, so why not.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Films like ""Kill Bill"" are quite great cinematic experiences, but ""Grindhouse"" takes everything to a new level. Bad acting, editing, directing, music and special effects are used, but never have those elements made such an enjoyable film. The film is a double feature: the first film, ""Planet Terror"" by Robert Rodriguez, has a ""Dawn of the Dead""-like plot about flesh-eating zombies terrorizing a town, with the survivors fighting for their lives. The second film is quite different. ""Death Proof"", directed by Quentin Tarantino, has a psychotic macho man stalking women on the road. People seeing this film should not expect the film to be over after ""Planet Terror"" ends. The film is not for everyone; it's mostly for fans of the two directors and understanding that they are intentionally making bad movies. The trailers at the beginning and in between the films are clever, disgusting, and hilarious. Tarantino and Rodriguez have really payed homage to B-movie exploitation films, and they actually make a bad movie seem so fun to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just fantastic!!!!,"Incredible 3 hours+ double feature by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino with fake coming attractions mixed in. First up is ""Planet Terror"" by Rodriguez which has a hot shot guy (Freddy Rodriguez) and his tough as nails girlfriend (Rose McGowan) fighting flesh eating zombies with others. Among other cast members are Michael Biehn and Josh Brolin. It successfully imitates a stupid sleazy grind house horror film with large does of (purposefully) fake-looking gore and plays it straight while poking fun of itself. And wait for when McGowan gets the weapon for a leg! Next is Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" with Kurt Russell as a stuntman who uses his indestructible car to kill people. It starts off slow but all leads up to a climatic battle which is just incredible and had my audience cheering and yelling along! In between there are fake trailers for movies such as ""Werewolf Women of the SS"" (great to see Sybil Danning again) and others.These movies were supposed to look cheap. Rodriguez' does with rips and tears (and a whole missing reel) but Tarantino's doesn't. It's virtually crystal clear with shots that no grind house movie would ever have. Still all is forgiven with that incredible final battle. I can't remember the last time I've seen an audience so whipped up by a movie! The cast for both movies play there roles completely straight. McGowan (who's in both) is lots of fun and Russell is a scream in his role--I LOVED it when he winked at the camera! Also Rodriguez was really good (and very attractive) in his role. Nobody is bad but those three stand out.I can only give this a 9 for a few reason--""Planet Terror"" does have its slow spots and ""Death Proof"" starts off very slow. Also one of the coming attraction done by Eli Roth (""Thanksgiving"") was overly gory and just sick (it had to be cut to get an R rating). Roth obviously doesn't know how to do comedy...or movies for that matter.Still this is a fun and rousing film. The 3 hours+ plus just flew by. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
2 B movies from 2 A directors,"The concept of Grindhouse is nothing short of spectacular. Combining 2 A filmmakers into one good old-fashioned B film double feature is sadly an art that has been out of practice in Hollywood.As usual the casting is superb. Freddy Rodriguez was a great leading actor in Planet Terror and Kurt Russell was superb in Death Proof. Rosario Dawson is just as sexy as ever as the smokin hot butt kicker, but she also plays a really cute down to earth girl for most of the film.The trailers in the film beat the hell out of the real ones. In fact I desperately want to see 2 of them. I don't know if it was intentional but they made fun of Rob Zombie's adaptation of Halloween w/ Thanksgiving directed by Rob Zombie as well as putting Nicolas Cage as a mock role in another trailer that came after watching the trailer for another crappy film of his.My only complaints w/ the films: Planet Terror was just simply way too graphic, to the point where my gag reflex almost came out (which has only happened once). You kinda figure with all the limits being pushed they would've had more sexuality/nudity to make up for the obscene zombie material.Death Proof lagged w/ all the boring conversation. During the film reels are missing, but at appropriate, or in my case inappropriate times since I wanted to see what would happen next. Unfortunately the actual film stopped playing for 10 minutes b/c the reel had to be changed. When it resumed, the film droned on into the typical Tarantino style of dialog as seen in Pulp Fiction, but this time it really drags out. I was also disappointed w/ how abruptly the film ended as well as the change of heart emitted from one of the characters.Overall, it is definitely a must-see, but I think for me I'll only see it again if I'm really drunk.8/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Break from the Usual,"I might be one of the few 80s kids out there that got to see a true grindhouse film in the drive-in theatres and the clichéd rundown cineplex. So, in seeing GRINDHOUSE PLANET TERROR - DEATH PROOF, I was nostalgically happy to hear the familiar splash screen tune and hypnotic colour wheel. What followed afterward was sheer adult cinematic, low-brow fun. For those who aren't familiar with the exaggerated exploits of drama and action that even John Woo would salivate over these films had usually two or more B-movies which divulged heavily into just about every social taboo possible... ranging from sex, drugs, and race-exploitations.Robert Rodriguez Quentin Tarantinos GRINDHOUSE touches on the elements that made that genre of cinema popular, while adding both contemporary previous film glimpses that visually aware moviegoers should spot easily. PLANET TERROR literally gives us a zombie movie better than many seen in recent years(take note, RESIDENT EVIL!)... complete with the machine gun-legged Rose McGowan. Kurt Russell stars in DEATH PROOF, a muscle car thriller about a demented stunt car driver finally meeting his match.In addition to the trip down memory lane, guest directors Eli Roth(HOSTEL), Rob Zombie(THE DEVILS REJECTS), and even Edgar Wright(SHAUN OF THE DEAD) provide hilariously cheesy action intermission trailers displaying a machete toting federali, a kill-crazy Pilgrim, and even demented Women breeding Wolfmen! For the full experience, see this flick at the movies during a matinée instead of waiting for it on DVD. And bring friends, they're sure to applaud and squirm at the overwhelmingly crazy sights sounds... of GRINDHOUSE.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Total Garbage,"I'm not sure I can write a 1000 words or ten lines about this movie, but I will try. It is a total piece of junk. Crap disguised as art and enjoyed by the multitude of pretentious people who suffer from the ""tyranny of being cool."" It has lousy acting (I've seen better at middle school plays), poor cinematography (makes ""Blair Witch"" look like ""Lawrence of Arabia""), stupid story lines (appears to have been written by a committee of 10 yr old psychopaths) stupid ""cutiness"" (the dumb trailers), and all this in name of emulating 1950s bad horror flicks. To begin with, why emulate junk? I know that the majority of IMDb reviewers really love this type of garbage (Check the ratings of ""Snatch,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"", etc.), but this really goes beyond bad taste.

excellent,"At first I was doubtful of Grindhouse. Friends of mine that had seen it before me said that Planet Terror blew Death Proof out of the water. But, I don't think that is the case at all. Planet Terror, although great, was extraordinarily gimmicky. Not saying that is a bad thing. Death Proof is a master work of muscle car films, Tarantino knew exactly what kind of movie he wanted to make and went out and f**king made it. The psychology of the film was astonishing. Kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Kurt Russel delivers the second best role he has ever done (first being Snake Plisken in John Carpenter's Escape From New York.) I don't want to give the movie away to all of you haven't yet had a free 3.5 hours to check this out, but if I were you I would definitely make it a point to grab your most comfortable a$$ cushion and get down to your local multiplex and watch these two films, because there is nothing cooler than a Nazi werewolf shooting a machine while standing next to two topless broads.Adam in A-Town",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

I'm not sure if they were supposed to be as funny as my friends and I found them to be, but they turned out to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen...ever.These movies were the type of movie that when Cherry (Rose McGowan) propelled herself into the air with her machine-gun leg in Planet Terror, or Zoë (Zoë Bell) somehow hung onto the hood of a car for an extended period of time during a car chase scene in Death Proof, you turned to your friends to find them all looking around too like ""Did that seriously happen?""... and then you all laugh because you know that it's supposed to be over-the-top.I found Death Proof to be especially great based only on the fact that it didn't follow the ""now-a-day"" horror/thriller direction, and what a pleasant surprise that was.MY ADVICE: Grab some friends, grab a ticket, grab a front row seat, and get ready to enjoy a very imaginative take on the classic double-feature, missing reel, and extremely graphic theater production known as...

Tarantino is better than Rodrigue',"Without a doubt the best part of Grindhouse is the last 20 minutes. I've heard someone say it is the best car chase ever put on film, and that may not be an exaggeration; it certainly deserves to be in the top two spot. The only competition is the car chase in Matrix 2, but unlike Matrix Tarantino only used his guts and that of his star not CGI, or at least he appeared to not use CGI. Tarantino's car chase was not quiet as visually spectacular as the one in Matrix but it had more emotional depth. It's hard to decide which is the superior.I'd rate the last 20 minutes as a 10, but the movie lasted over 3 hours, so I'm generous giving it an 8.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Grindhouse Tribute Pays Off,"Tarantino's films are a bit of an acquired taste. Frankly, most casual movie goers either love him or hate him. I'm one of the few who can take or leave him, but when Grindhouse was announced, I knew I would have to see it.As a tribute to the ""B"" flicks of the 1970's, this ""Grindhouse"" feature has been worked until the quality digital media closely resembled the scratched, hair-laden, ill-cut films of the era. I would imagine with today's technology, it took more work to rough it up that badly, than it would have to present a quality modern-day actioner.The idea of the Grindhouse Double Feature is not new, but this work stands as Tarantino's revivalist attempt, and both films were great fun.Planet Terror is a sci-fi horror gore-fest I found delightful. The story was prominent, but did take a back seat to the gore effects, which were mostly make up effects. This was great in that ""B"" movie kind of way, and even serious movie goers can view this one comfortably as a guilty pleasure and rates a 7.7/10 on the ""B"" scale.Death Proof was the one I was waiting for, personally. Kurt Russell again on the big screen as the tough-guy/bad boy? Yes! The stunts here were true stunts, without the use of CGI. The girls in this work were awesome, and it was heartwarming to see Russell back in the role in which the nation came to love him. This one was just plain good, in spite of the ""B"" movie factor and rates an 8.9/10 on the ""B"" scale.I'd say this attempt was a ""HIT.""

Decent Effort by Rodriguez and Tarantino,"Grindhouse is a rare experience since double features are not regularly made nowadays. The style that was put into making this double feature particularly makes it feel like two older movies (perhaps from the 70s) but with contemporary actors we know and love like Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin, and Rosario Dawson to name a few. Together, Planet Terror and Death Proof bring an interesting experience to viewers. Separately, each is a good (but not great) B movie.What worked for Planet Terror: it is awesome as a ""disease"" or ""outbreak"" movie. Even though the film is generally darkly lit, the killing of the infected proves to be action-packed and very bloody (did Tarantino ghost direct certain parts)? Wray is a really cool character with a clear expertise on guns and a great shooter. Cherry is good as well, but a little more bland than Wray. While the coolest aspect of the film has to be when Cherry gains a gun for a leg it defies the logic of her knowing how to operate it without pulling a trigger of any sorts. Also, it does not seem to run out of ammo. But this logic is somewhat irrelevant since it is clear Planet Terror was made for fun.What worked for Death Proof: Tarantino is at it again with conversations that connect dots between various situations. For example, in the first half of the film a girl is told to do a lap- dance for the first man who says something specific to her, and her friends urge her not to be ""chickens***."" When Kurt Russell tries this on this same girl later in the film, he makes an analogy to the common phrase ""in my book"" and threatens to put this girl under ""chickens***"" in his ""book."" Unlike most Tarantino movies, however, it lacks substance, and at its most basic, Death Proof is about Kurt Russell tracking two sets of girls - one in the first half and another in the second half. Even with Tarantino-esque dialogue, this segment falls short of great, but Kurt Russell's performance in this movie is convincing and impressive.It is a fun experience to watch this double feature, but do not expect to watch two masterpieces by any means.3.0/4.0",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Grindhouse:  B-,"Maybe I'm giving the flick a bit of a raw deal, but going in with rather lukewarm expectations, I was disappointed when the end credits rolled. All in all, the trailers were the best part. In terms of the two films, Rodriguez fulfilled the assignment and while his film went on a tad too long, it was a hell of a lot of fun. Tarantino, in typical QT fashion, tried to de-construct the Grindhouse picture and it came off in a lackluster fashion. Yeah, the car chase was great and Kurt Russell has charisma but the dialogue and structure just didn't mesh with the objective of the project. As a friend put it, ""It felt like the opening of ""Reservoir Dogs"" stretched out over an hour and a half with a car chase towards the end."" All in all, the ""Grindhouse"" experience (two movies, fake trailers, and the whole premise of the shift in viewer mode) was a lot of fun and I suggest it to anyone (especially in the light that the DVD issues will be segregated with the cuts and scratches taken out). However, I cannot help but wonder how far we can push post-modernity and ironic viewership until it deflates into itself.Thoughts?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Really wanted to like this show, honest","""Grindhouse"" is a self-indulgent mess. Definitely a cool idea, but unfortunately the execution is spectacularly boring. The film didn't live up to the crazy notions the concept evoked, just like the original exploitation source material never lived up to sleazy movie posters or radio spots. Daydreaming about what a film like ""Grindhouse"" might be like is more fun and productive plus way less tedious than sitting through the actual show.For at least a few minutes Rodriquez's ""Planet Terror"" segment seems as if it might be a fun spin around the block. Unfortunately the story becomes quickly mired in an over-complicated plot at the expense of what should be straight-forward camp. Plus Rodriguez loses sight of the show's concept and embraces state-of-the-art film-making instead of genre schlock. Uneven results become tedious, much like the overly pained expressions of Rose McGowan's hatchet face. (Why didn't Rodriquez replace her head with the machine gun? Not only would there have been less scowling, but her performance could've improved greatly.) Plus there isn't a single sympathetic character in the entire mess. Oh well.On the positive side, some of the hospital scenes decently parody the exploitation genre...but at the same time also detract from the show as a whole by bringing attention to those majority of scenes that fall flat. Nice seeing Michael Biehn, though.Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" rocks whenever Kurt Russell's on screen. Unfortunately, they must've only had him for three or four days because most of the screen time's eaten up by two trios of in-your-face stupid chicks who won't shut the hell up. You think Kevin Smith dialog is interminable and inane? Hey Tarantino -- typing page after page of expository dialog for EVERY character in the same Witty Coolspeak makes EVERY character sound the same. Specifically, EVERY character sounds as if the writer's desperately attempting to impress his daddy/the audience. Daddy and the audience are bored stiff, not impressed. During an advanced screening of about 50 people, one viewer screamed ""Shut up already!"" during the talk talk talky restaurant sequence. Received the biggest laugh of the show.Again, on the positive side, Kurt Russell rocks. But he's too peripheral to the yattering yentas swerving their hollow heads, yo. Tarantino obviously comprehends the concept of a faux '70s exploitation homage more than does Rodriguez, plus some of the car stunts toward the end create what amounts to the scant dramatic tension in the entire film. ""Death Proof"" probably falls less flat than ""Planet Terror"" but is instantly tedious and paper thin.All but one of the fake trailers are nothing special, much better stuff's clogging YouTube. Peppering cast members as different characters in segments was fun, but WTF did they pull the missing reel gag twice? Oof. Symbolic of the destructive self-indulgence at work?At least they nailed the music, especially during Tarantino's segment. The ""Death Proof"" title sequence is the showstopper, complete with sloppy title swap and incredible POV. Plus those fake emulsion scrapes, jump frames, classic theater notices and '70s studio logos made everyone smile. But even those touches, wonderful as they were, just couldn't save a film more than three hours long.Yes, this assessment is heresy to the Rodriguez & Tarantino Faithful. But the idea for ""Grindhouse"" was infinitely more interesting and powerful than the film Rodriquez and Tarantino delivered. And boy did I want to like this film. R&T just wouldn't let me.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Like a Roller Coaster Ride!,"When I first saw Grindhouse, it was for my 18th birthday party. They seemed to have no trouble at the local Edwards with letting me and my under-18 friends into the film, but that could have a lot to do with the fact that my friend Ian is quite big, causing him to appear older. We all went to see this film at first with the question on our minds of whether or not it would be good, I myself had mixed feelings before we went. However, within the first five minutes, the film captured us. First off, it introduces itself and appears in such a manner as a low budget shock film, the very difference however is intentional. The film was actually modified in order to appear low budget, with missing film reels, film skips, color filter issues, and a point where the film actually melts. The sheer cleverness of the film is enveloped and carefully portrayed through the quirks throughout. Grindhouse would be like a pie with a piece for everyone, 33% comedy, 33% horror, and 33% action/car chase. The TV adverts definitely did no justice for the film, as they didn't seem well enough to attract people to this 3 hour sitting. Couple that with the fact that the film contains graphic violence, strong language, and disturbing content to turn your stomach, and you've got a recipe for what turns out to be a marathon of badassery. Every sentence in the film is spoken with fulfilling character, and there are hundreds of witty comments and visual gags. The film feels both spoof and homage to the exploitation flicks of the 70's, and at the same time, it continues to push the boundaries of what's safe to show in theaters. I strongly encourage anybody with an appreciation for superb acting, a mindset for witty one-liners, and a stomach for gore to go and see this movie. You may even want to see it a second time to piece the two films in it together, and you'll definitely want to snatch it when it comes to DVD!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An Excellent,Thrilling And Unforgettable Double Bill And Film Experience.","Grindhouse is an excellent and unforgettable film experience and a entertaining double feature from Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez/ Filled with amazing direction from Tarantino and Rodriguez,great casts and hilarious fake trailers from Rodriguez,Eli Roth,Rob Zombie and Edgar Wright,Grindhouse is a double feature that will stay with you.Grindhouse is a wild double feature of two over the top Horror films.First film:Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror. Set in Texas,Planet Terror tells the story of a group of people led by go-go dancer Cherry Darling(Rose Mcgowan)and her ex-boyfriend El Wray(Freddy Rodriguez)who are trying to survive a Zombie outbreak.Second Film:Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof. Death Proof tells the story of two groups of women who are being stalked by a psychotic stunt car driver named Stuntman Mike(Kurt Russell),a guy who kills people with his car.Released in 2007,Grindhouse was an amazing double feature that was a failure at the box office grossing only 25 million dollars that was well below it's 53 million dollar budget. That's a shame because I think people missed out on a great and fun time at the movies with two films that gives viewers Action,Hot,beautiful Women,gore and B-movie delight. Planet Terror:Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror is an excellent Zombie movie and was and is my favorite and the best of the two Grindhouse films. Right from the very beginning Planet Terror is a movie that pays homage to Zombie films from the 1970s and 80s giving viewers excitement,thrills and Action and you never take it seriously thanks to the characters and offbeat Humor that the movie has. When the Action starts it never stops and PT has an energy that is wild and over the top and it truly matches the style and tone of a Drive-in B-Movie and Rodriguez rolls with it with scratches on the film's photography and insane editing. Planet Terror's main characters are flawed but are likable and heroic to the point where you want them to survive and live. The Action is PT is amazing and exciting filled with gunfights and explosions that are done in Comic Book style and Robert Rodriguez's other movies. The blood and gore in PT is very disgusting and not for the weak at heart but at times is done for laughs because the blood and gore splashes on the screen like water and paint. The final 20-30 minutes of Planet Terror are brilliant and Action-packed and will have you cheering. A great conclusion. After Planet Terror there is an intermission that includes four fake movie trailers including the trailer at the start of the film Robert Rodriguez's Action-packed and fun Machete(which later became a feature film),a Action-filled and over the top homage to Vigilante and Revenge films of the 1970s and 80s,Rob Zombie's Werewolf Women Of The SS,Edgar Wright's Don't and last but not least Eli Roth's Thanksgiving,a hilarious parody of 1970s and 80s Slasher Films. After the intermission came the second feature Death Proof. Death Proof:Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof is a film I have always had mixed feelings about because it's not a bad film in any sense of the word but a flawed film the ranks below Tarantino's best work but at the same time there are good things about the film. One of the things I like about the film is the style and look of the film which makes the movie feel like a exploitation film of the 1970s with scratches on the film as well as gritty photography and you will feel that Tarantino knows his exploitation movies. Another One of the things I like about Death Proof is it's Tarantino's take on the Slasher Film where instead of a knife welding psychopath with a mask killing the victims it's a crazy former Stuntman car driver named Stuntman Mike who kills with a his car who doesn't wear a mask or carry a knife. When Stuntman Mike is in the film the movie the character makes the film interesting but when he's gone the film feels empty. DP is a Slasher film that is combined with the Car chase films of the 1970s and Tarantino gives viewers one of the best car chases in film history which is exciting and intense and a car crash which is truly disturbing and shocking. What I don't like about the film is the female characters their dialog and talking and the ending. While the female characters are sexy and attractive the talking and dialog by the female characters is boring and dull and add nothing to the film and makes you root for Stuntman Mike than the female characters. It seems like Tarantino got too attached to his dialog. The ending of the film while good makes me mad as a fan of Kurt Russell and it's kind of hard for me to look at the screen and watch what happens to Russell. The ending of Death Proof is fine but could have been handled better.The casts is both films including Rose McGowen(Cherry Darling),Freddy Rodriguez(El Wray),Kurt Russell(Stuntman Mike),Rosario Dawson(Abernathy)and more do excellent jobs in their roles.The directions by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are excellent,with Rodriguez always moving the camera and bringing a wild and insane energy to the film and Tarantino also moving the camera with great angles and slow movements while also bringing a wild energy to the film. Great directions by Rodriguez and Tarantino.The score for Planet Terror by Robert Rodriguez,Graeme Revell and Carl Thiel is brilliant,stylish and similar to the scores by John Carpenter in the 1980s and matches the tone of Planet Terror. Great score. While Death Proof soundtrack is a amazing mixture of songs in the genres of Rock N'Roll,Soul and R&B. Wonderful soundtrack.In final word,if you love Quentin Tarantino,Robert Rodriguez,Horror films,B-movies,Drive-in films or genre films in general,I highly suggest you see Grindhouse,an excellent double bill and film experience you will never forget. Highly Recommended/ 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Exactly What You Expect,"While I thought this film was an excellently executed piece of entertainment, there are so many other people that have praised this film before me, so I will leave it at the point of saying that I enjoyed myself.With that said, I would like to address the people that gave this film a negative review. I have read some of these negative comments and would just like to respond to some of the accusations, because I feel like certain things need to be said. This film, or series of films, was made for the purposes of enjoyment and entertainment, simple as that. I think we, as a society, have taken things a little too far with the over-analyzing of different art forms and we have somehow lost some of the essence put into the actual art. Film-making is a completely polarize art form, there are the average movie-goers who like to see action and romance and things that they don't get in their everyday lives; these people are frowned upon by the ""mature"" film community. Now there are the people that watch films for the artistic nature of the film, the art-buffs, the people that consider themselves well-versed in Ingmar Bergman and Fellini, typically the people who turn up their noses at the common people looking for a cheap thrill. This film was made to cater to the everyday type emotions, no subtle subtexts, no symbolism, just blood, guts, boobs, and one-liners, with a couple of rambles of banter. I read a previous reviewer who used the word Grindhouse as a marketing ploy to attract young viewers, which shows the ignorance of people. ""Grindhouse"" was the term to refer to a sleazy 42nd Street-esquire movie house that would ""grind"" together (hence term ""grindhouse"") two completely different films into a double feature. They were typically seedy places which would be frequented by low-lives and were common places for missing reels, terrible projection quality, and film strips burning, hence the constant references throughout the film. I am very aggravated by the people that have shunned this film, calling it low and stupid and all these things that it aims to be on purpose. Some people need to get off their high horses, it isn't cool just to go against popular opinion, though I'm sure some people are saying they hate the film just because it has gotten so much recognition. And yes, the only reason this film is making so many ripples in the media is because Tarantino's name is on it, which is a great thing, because maybe people will start to revert and stop making this watered-down crap, bring back the old aesthetics, you know?",,Anonymous,Horror

Genius,"The movie was genius!! I loved it I want to see it over and over again. The experience was just something that I will remember. As the first movie started, people were fine and after the first movie, people were leaving. Some came back, some didn't. I thought it was interesting how people were just leaving at anytime they wanted to. It reminded me of a drive in movie theater when they show a double feature. People just wanted to watch a movie and not 2. The whole experience was very exciting. I love the shots and the angles, they stuck to the grindhouse format. It's sleezy, gory, and Great. The movies that are shown are just absolutely amazing. The special effects in the movies were definitely not around in the 70s and it was great to actually have more sophisticated effects in a film mocking other old film styles. I would highly suggest for everyone to see this movie! It is a great work of art!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""You know how in movies they say 'Well, you're OK in my book...?"" Well, I just so happen to have a book, and this film is going to have to filed under F-in Awesome","This here film have by jaw on the ground and my knees to my chin, in horror, laughter, tension, and excitement. The reason why this movie pulls itself off so well is because right away we are introduced to the most ridiculous characters existing in a world where they are accepted and even glamorized. After a very awkward ""1408"" trailer, The Rodriguez directed 'Machete' trailer is prevued and it sets the tone for the next (well-spent) two and half hours. Sex, gore, and violence, is what's being served and it the best (in Texas) that has ever, I do dare say 'ever', hit the silver screen. Planet Terror is every zombie movie script with a few (albeit genius) changes. Mysterious savior (El Wray), girl who loves savior and has a dark past but will learn her destiny, (Cherry Darling), Evil villain who is doing all the wrong things for the right reasons (kind of) are all portrayed to a tee, and Rodriguez's pacing and editing scores major points. Yes there is maybe 20-30 minutes missing due to a missing reel, but the story doesn't lack for this reason. The violence and gore are plenty and those tender, dialog moments, just give you enough time to breathe, but don't breathe too deep you may end up in a Planet Terror of your own... The Trailers that play during intermission are also great fun. ""Werewolf Women of the SS"", ""DON'T"" and ""Thanksgiving"" are all various forms of the horror genre and leave wondering, ""am i crazy or do i totally want to see that?"" Than Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" rips open. Granted, while i was watching this i thought that it was slow, a little bit too slow, perhaps, and that after and hour or so of death and mayhem, watching a few women drive around and talk about flings was really bringing me down, but once Kurt Russel decides to prove that his car is in fact 'Death Proof' the carnage is so overwhelming the next 40-45 minutes of talk is appreciated. The end to 'Death Proof' had my theatre in riotous laughter and even though it was 12:30 everyone left there jazzed about the possibly the greatest film going experience they had in . . . geez has it been that long? If you're contemplating seeing this movie, just do it all ready, whatever tickets prices are, they're well worth it, two movies, nay two great movies, the price of one and an experience that will last a life time is more than any other strand of celluloid has even dare to offer, let alone deliver, in the past, oh say 10 . . .15 years? For good, dirty fun that's like listening to rock n roll and driving down a lone highway at 200 miles per hour there's only place to meet that thrill and that's down at the GRINDHOUSE.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"thrill's yes,adrenaline no,surprise's yes,shock's no,","Grindhouse is a double feature from best bud film maker's Quinten Tarintino and Robert Rodriguez who have been known to collaborate most notably in Despardo,From Dusk Till Dawn and Four Rooms and most recently the quick growing cult which has already gotten Two more sequels Sin City.If you have seen those and liked them this is a film for you.Grindhouse is made in the style of many 1970's exploitation flick's. When Tarantino was on Jay Leno he went threw the many such as Blaxpotation,Sexpoltation,Neo-Nazipotation,Kung-Fuxpotaion and many other's.This film stay's true to it's promotional promise's unlike many Hollywood commercial pic's today.We see it all from head's exploding to graphic car crashers's which some may be sensitive to.This is all by the start of the opening fake trailer called Machate.Then the Rodriguez feature begin's which is called Planet Terror about human's who are infected by toxic gas and turn to Zoombies.Far from original but again Grindhouse is not trying to be that.The attachment to killed of character's is stronger in Planet Terror with romance and humor and a ending which make's the first feature hold it's own against our Tarantino feature.A few fake trailer's later we have Deathproof about a twisted man named stuntman mike where we never really know if he was ever a stuntman.Either way Kurt Russel play's the hell out of him.About a stalker who is a serial killer who has road rage.The film end's in a surprising way because we would expect something that try's so hard to be original.There still are cliché's of each artist work. Tarantino still couldn't make it threw with out drooping a few dozen N-bomb's.Rodriguez has what will be another memorable strip oh excuse me go-go dance scene(From Dusk Till Dawn).Tarantino throw's in some blaxpotation character's and theme's.Rodriguez still has that action/romance mix.But this isn't trying to be new.The best performance's come from the whole cast of Planet Terror and as for Death Proof it come's from Kurt Russel,Sydney Tamiia Poitier,Vanessa Ferlito,Tracie Thoms and stunt performer Zoe Bell who play's herself well.The ultimate question is which one is better? Well that just depend's on your taste.My opinion swing's different way's.Directorial work-(the opening scene give's that ultimate theater feel)Planet Terror.Acting-both.Dialouge-Deathproof.Most watchable-Deathproof.At the end though it's Deathproof.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
You haven't experienced anything like it.,"Ah, Grindhouse. No words to quite describe it. For me, there is nothing more valuable or intriguing than trash AS high art. This movie is just that...in SPADES. Want to escape your life for 3 hours? Do it. But be sure not to go to the bathroom or even miss one second of this ultra violent, exploitative tour de force. Remember the ""NOW OUR FEATURE PRESENTATION"" title card from Kill Bill Vol. 1? Grindhouse basically feels like that all the way through. I can honestly say that, after viewing this masterpiece, I walked out of the theater shaking and smiling - a REAL smile. They say movies produce drugs in the brain, and after seeing Grindhouse, I have no doubt my dopamine levels were severely upped. Planet Terror, the first in the double feature, is just plain fun all the way through. That's really all I can say. The ending TRULY feels like a B movie. The fake trailers are fun too, but the real star of this entire effort is by far DEATH PROOF.. Pure Tarantino from beginning to end, the only complaint I have is a little bit of excessive dialog (reminiscent of the Superman speech from Kill Bill Vol 2) - but it's not as bad as people try to convey. Wait it out folks...wait out all 3 hours and 11 minutes of this feature and I promise it will be worth it. After it was over, people were actually cheering and clapping, something I haven't experienced in years...maybe ever. Rodriguez and Tarantino's egos DO show through the film, but who cares? These guys are so talented and passionate, they couldn't make a real B movie if they tried. At least they've contributed SOMETHING to the world. GRINDHOUSE.

The Best Movie In Decades!,"About 5 minutes into Robert Rodriguez's 'Planet Terror', his segment in my new favorite movie 'Grindhouse', you know a few things, one - that you'll have a great time watching this movie, two - that you'll hear some terrific writing from two of the best screenwriters of our time, and three - you're gonna see some great actors, and truly there aren't any bad performances in Grindhouse (except for Quentin Tarantino...), and there's really nothing short of extraordinary about Grindhouse.Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez offer two fantastic movies for the price of one fantastic movie. And that would be enough - but wait! There's more! There are fake trailers for faux 1970's B-movies, which I'm sure you've heard about already, and even though these trailers are completely awesome and hilarious. They serve as an intermission between both movies, but believe me, you DO NOT want to miss these, so don't drink anything before you go see it. There really isn't a dull moment in either movie.The first trailer you see is Robert Rodriguez's ""Machete"" with Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin. It is probably my favorite trailer out of all of them. It is about a Mexican assassin who's left for dead, and then gets his revenge against the people who 'f---ed with the wrong Mexican!' Then you're thrown directly into 'Planet Terror', Robert Rodriguez's tale of zombies, diabolical plans, and girls with machine guns for legs! Rose McGowan plays Cherry Darling, a go-go dancer who wants to quit and become a stand up comedian. Cherry's left leg is an early casualty of a zombie outbreak that has something to do with toxic green gas and Osama Bin Laden. Cherry comes into her own when her ex-boyfriend El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez) makes her a machine gun prosthetic for her leg. She comes into her own by killing a whole lotta people. In Planet Terror, we also see the story of Dakota Block (Marley Shelton) and her diabolical husband, played by Josh Brolin. They are both great stories...and that's just the first movie. And you don't wanna miss the end of Planet Terror. It comes on rather quick, but it's really great.We see more fake trailers, including Edgar Wright's ""Don't"" which warns the audience, 'If you're thinking of seeing this movie alone...DON'T!!!' and we also see the deeply sick trailer for Eli Roth's 'Thanksgiving', where a naked cheerleader gets impaled with a knife, and trust me, it's much grosser than it sounds. And we also see a trailer for Rob Zombie's ""Werewolf Women of the SS"" and I'm not even gonna spoil that for you...And we're right into 'Death Proof', Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof"", which is just like any Tarantino film, and I'm sure that there will be the group of stupid people who say that this movie is 'boring' and 'drags on forever', but it doesn't. If you remember, all of Quentin Tarantino's movies have lots of dialogue in them, and that has never been a problem. And it still isn't. Death Proof has a nice balance of gore and great dialogue, so it's like a great breather after 'Planet Terror' brings new meaning to the term 'extreme'. But in my opinion, 'Death Proof should have been first on the bill. If it was, this would have been beyond perfect.But which one do I like more? Well, that is really a tough question, considering that both of these movies are perfect. But I will say, for $11, Grindhouse is quite a deal. You see 2 movies, fake trailers and crappy little candy ads from the 1970's, which add a great touch to the movie. It's a great experience. It'd be a crime to miss it.Grindhouse: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Greatest Movie Ever Made.,"The mainstream prefers the spoon-fed stupidity of Wil Ferrell but for anyone who truly loves Movies as a visceral visual experience, this is as great as it gets. Rodriguez and Tarantino have brilliantly mined vintage 70s exploitation cinema for a no-holds-barred trip - not down memory lane, but up the Road to Glory. This will become the Ultimate Cult Flick. QT's half ""Death Proof"" seems to start slow but on reflection the character buildup is a shrewd calculation, making the shocking midway slaughter and the breathless vengeful finale that much more devastating. RR's 'Planet Terror"" is the most slam-bang action/horror/sci-fi flick EVER, with (almost) no filler. Even the fake trailers - ""Werewolf Women of the SS,"" ""Machete,"" ""Thanksgiving"" and ""Don't"" - are more imaginative, entertaining and original than the ""respectable, serious"" glorified garbage nominated for Oscars (like ""The Queen"" - the worst movie I've ever seen, because it is insufferably dull.) Rose McGowan is the B Movie Queen of the 21st Century. For intelligent people who dig their thrills cheap and fast, ""Grindhouse"" is a work of sheer genius, made by and for B Movie Buffs. Anyone who doesn't even know what the term ""grindhouse"" means won't truly get it, so skip it. For everyone else, it is The Greatest Movie Of All Time.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gritty Perfection,"A once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience, 'Grindhouse' is a movie going experience like none other. Delivering hours of heart pounding thrills and popcorn popping entertainment, 'Grindhouse' is what going to the movies is all about. Robert Rodriguez's 'Planet Terror' and Quentin Tarantino's 'Death Proof' both stand alone as fine filming achievements, and individually have their own strengths. But together they become an over-the-top, diabolical duo. It's some of the most fun you'll ever have at the cinema.Half of 'Grindhouse' is the experience. Down to a 'T', Rodriguez and Tarantino capture the essence of the time period of American culture they recreate so masterfully. The film quality is grainy, and there are even 'missing reels'. The fake trailers are so outrageous, they truly make 'Grindhouse' come full circle. A machete-wielding Mexican assassin, a Thanksgiving murderer from Eli Roth, and even werewolf women created by the Nazi SS as apart of their master plan (thanks for that one go to Rob Zombie). It's as if you've stepped through a time machine that's brought you back to a time where such raw and frank violence is, today, only a memory.Rodriguez comes to us first in this double feature with 'Planet Terror', a zombie gorefest which involves a biochemical that threatens to engulf the world. I honestly couldn't have asked for more. For those thrill-seeking, gore-hungry fans looking for a bloody good time, look no further. So ridiculously yet wonderfully gruesome, it's over-the-top in the best possible way. Bursting boils, exploding heads, dismembered body parts (testicles included), gallons of blood, etc. 'Planet Terror' is certainly not for the squeamish or faint of heart, but it is a hell of a lot of fun. The action is non-stop and crowd-pleasingly top notch. You'll be blissfully content as 'Terror' takes you on a sick and twisted ride that Rodriguez packs to the rim with action exploitation.While it's slow getting started and a bit too talky, Tarantino's 'Death Proof' delivers some heart thumping moments as it follows Stuntman Mike, his sweet ride, and their terrorizing ways. The film's first thirty minutes or so is mostly dialogue, but it still does a fine job holding your attention. You get to know the characters, and you actually begin to like them. It's well-worth the wait, because the extended car chase certainly delivers the goods. It's a dazzling spectacle, adrenaline-pumping from start to finish. It's raw cinema with Tarantino in complete control, and I think it's suffice to say 'Death Proof' assembles one of the better chases ever put on film. Tarantino is slow out of the starting gate, but he finishes with a bang. A high-speed, pedal-to-the-metal bang. It may not have the same entertainment factor of 'Planet Terror', but it's an impressive and bold piece of film-making that slowly pulls you in.What does 'Grindhouse' and the sky have in common? They're full of stars. Lots of 'em. Both 'Planet Terror' and 'Death Proof' have their fair share of talents, while Rose McGowan does double duty in both segments. The moment she straps on that mighty gun to make up for the leg a zombie chewed off, you know you're in for some full-throttle, ass-kicking action fun. She and Freddy Rodriguez are excellent together in 'Terror', the chemistry is there. Marley Shelton and Josh Brolin are just as good as a, how can I put it, dysfunctional married couple. Bruce Willis and Quentin Tarantino even get in on the action with cameos of their own. When it comes to 'Death Proof', Kurt Russel is fantastic as the film's antagonist. Not much is required on his part, the cars are the true stars in this feature, but his presence is a big lift to the project. The film's female stars do an impressive job in their dialogue-driven roles. Rosario Dawson, beautiful as always, is always fun to watch. Stunt double Zoe Bell stars as herself, and when you see 'Death Proof', you'll know why. Her death defying car ride is the film's best and most exciting moment.It's guaranteed that you'll walk away from your time spent with 'Grindhouse' having seen something you've never seen before, having experienced something you've never experienced before. You may find it hard to believe when I say this is the best we've seen so far in this still youthful year, but you simply must pay a visit and experience the movie magic for yourself. I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of 'Grindhouse', and it's something I won't soon forget. Prepare yourself, and strap in for the ride. I'll see you at the grindhouse.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Two movies of completely different quality,"I can only average this movie because Rodriguezes Planet Terror was wonderful while Tarantino's Death Proof was awful.First, Planet Terror was gruesome, gorish, ridiculous, full of hot chicks and completely and utterly fun. In a time in cinematography where every single crappy script writer takes himself seriously, this pulls no punches, making it the funnest film I've seen since Feast. Lots of fun in casting as well. Fergie looks hotter than in any of her videos.I have all the respect in the world for Kurt Russell, a great actor that could have had a lot more meaningful roles. In Death Proof he plays well, but the film itself is completely boring. 50 minutes of watching painful dialogue (and SMSing) between brainless bimbos and their horny boyfriends, then they die. End part 1. Next set of bimbos, again painful and boring dialogue. Kurt Russell appears. End part 2. End movie. WTF?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
great experience and film,"Just got back from seeing Grindhouse. There have been lots of great comments already, but here's my take. Planet Terror was very entertaining using Rodriguez's signature stylization techniques to great effect.Death Proof was just tremendous and without a doubt the superior film in almost every way. Better acting, better dialogue, better overall script, better directing (I'll give Planet Terror credit for perhaps better photography and editing). The casting of Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike couldn't have been better. The ensemble group of ""the girls"" were really good. BTW, did anyone else notice the wonderful way in which Tarantino's camera draws out and worships the sensuality of ""real"" women? There's a stretch where the character Butterfly, who begins the movie as a Northeastern girl next door-type, becomes a powerful object of sexual desire without changing (or removing) her clothes or engaging in any physical touching. The car chase scene is terrific, and the denouement is one of the most satisfying you'll ever see.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's so absurd and bizarre at parts that just make me like it a little bit more because of thatIt has the cinematography that we all are used to see in Roberto Rodriguez's movies, with all the explosions, the intense action, the ""impossible scenes"", the nice looking girls; but it has something else: a brilliant dark humour!The purpose of this project ""Grindhouse"" is clearly ""to restore"", in our fresh and young minds, the old ""horror garbage"" from the 70's, the kind of cinematography present in the horror b-series movies that nowadays we only can find in the bottom of some old video-store; and that goal is achieved, especially because it has a Roberto Rodriguez's touchOK, the movie is a bit ridiculous, exaggerated, bizarre, absurd, but all the fun is just there, because it was meant to be like that!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Would have preferred ""Boredom Proof""","I am not really sure what saddens me more... Is it that Tarantino has produced an unbelievably boring movie, or that the majority of people is even granting high scores to such a waste?!I do not have much to say about the Rodriguez movie, as it was OK. Not good...but OK. I could have even liked it, had Rodriguez tried to come up with anything original instead of reproducing scenes that were not funny in the 70s. It was not far enough over the edge to really be entertaining. ""Planet Terror"" has to compete with Peter Jackson's ""Braindead"", regarding splatter & humor. Braindead is now 15 years old, but still shows a lot better how to make fun of that genre. Planet Terror lacks the wits. It is certainly still funny enough to entertain adolescents...But that is the best I can say about it.Tarantino is apparently getting lost in something like arrogance. I have no better explanation. When a filmmaker writes a ""grindhouse""-screenplay that consists of 80 percent dumb dialog, he must either be too full of himself or he hates his audience. Normally I would say ""Ok. Let him do that. He may learn something from mistakes."", but the majority of his audience actually liked listening to groups of young women talking about pointless crap...for an hour...in a splatter movie...Many people seem to have had the impression that the 20 something minutes of action made up for the preceding boredom. I must assume that many of those people were children (or have been until recently). As arrogant as that sounds...I have no better explanation. That car chase was a ""nice"" idea...for maybe 5 minutes...After that it was about as exciting as the hour of dialog beforehand. And I never could have imagined the final scene to be created this boringly.You do not even need a scriptwriter for this nonsense!And thanks to all the thousands of people who praise such dung, we will likely see more of its kind in the future... Tarantino will look at the user ratings and revel further in his arrogance and ignorance. How sad!Damn...I can already hear Uwe Boll say ""Vy are zey givink me so lo ratinks? My movie was many betterer zan Deaz Proof.""",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
absolute film glory,"THis was the most fun i have ever had at the movie theater in my life. This movie is outwardly disgusting, completely and utterly hilarious, and is the only movie that has made me frightened for the characters. the best 3 1/2 hours of my life.Planet Terror exceeded all expectations, i was hesitant because i don't really like Rodriguez, but this movie was funny, gory, and really gory.Death Proof blew me away, it was the most suspenseful movie I've ever seen, the car stunts were flawless, and Quentin Tarantino has once again proved that he is the best director ever.i would have paid 30$ to see this movie , but i wouldn't recommend it to the faint of heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bubbly Melty Violence & Talky Girls = Grindhouse,"I'll split the review up since Grindhouse isn't one movie. It's two! Double Feature Time Baby!I'll start with Rodriguez's Terror Planet. You have many known actors in this film, including Bruce ""10 Inches"" Willis, Rose ""No Nudity Anymore"" McGowan, the tiny Freddy Rodriguez and the wise Josh Brolin, who plays his role as Doc Block the best. I'll simply tell you that it's a zombie/disease/sicko flick where an outbreak is taking place and people are rapidly turning into bubbly, pus-spewing maniacs. And let me tell you, the effects in this movie are awesome. Bubbly, melty flesh, head explosions/decapitations, hundreds of guns blasts....the movie is chock full of violence that any action/horror fan should dig. Unfortunately for me that is pretty much the only outstanding aspect of the film. The film feels very Hollywood and not very ""Grindhouse"" exploitative. You have some corny writing, some hard to believe moments (minor grievance) some over-the-top acting, which works, but most of the time doesn't. But how many people are focusing on acting anyways. Well I am, but you're probably not, since you're some type of retard. Anyways, to summarize Terror Planet up, it's a pretty nice time. If this flick didn't have such a plethora of unbelievable effects, it'd be tough to recommend, but it does, so I do, and it was good, so there.Death Proof on the other hand is one of the most inconsistent flicks I've seen in a long time. Where Terror Planet had great violence mixed with care-less characters almost all the way through, Death Proof has care-less characters that talk you to death through cliché, rapid-fire banter too much of the time. It's very Tarantino-esquire, but it's not at the same time. Reason why I say this, is because I've enjoyed Quentin's dialogue's in the past. But this was almost ridiculous. Too further whine, the character played by Traci Thoms, was too much to take. Her cliché ridden character was so sh!tty and annoying it took my erection away.....you've got to see the tail in this flick. Phewy. Anyways, the mix of her acting/delivery and the ""too cool"" writing didn't work for me in the slightest. But I feel most people will eat this up, since she was so dedicated in her acting. Thank goodness Stuntman Mike, Kurt Russell's character is in this movie. Kurt's delivery in this movie is awesome, he plays the suave, badass ex-stuntman who's sick and tired of not getting laid. That's bad news for the first set of ladies that we met, who are again struck by the annoying bug, but not as much as the second group of hens. When Death Proof has Kurt on the screen it becomes a fantastic flick, but when he's absent it struggles to keep it's motor running, thanks to the motor-mouth babes. Maybe that's what they should have called it instead of Death Proof, Motor-Mouth Babes Meets Stuntman Mike....nah. Again, consistency issues arise and even the awesome character of Russell changes gears and you're left with a pretty abrupt and average ending....I almost said Empty Tank. But Death Proof, just like Terror Planet, has incredibly scenes (gotta give the nod to Zoe ""She-Ra"" Bell) and not so incredibly scenes. But again like TP, it ends up with some damage, but nothing that'll stop me from recommending it.Grindhouse is different, unique, and one cool production...but, sometimes too cool for it's own good. You have two great directors who made two movies, that will be eaten up by the masses, one reason because it's unlike anything they've seen. And you got to take your hats off to them for at least making an attempt to pay homage to classic grindhouse flicks. I say keep it up, but next time, less comedy and more grit!Terror Planet - 8 Death Proof - 7.5 Grindhouse - 8",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Two fun films in one,"Planet Terror: As one part of Grindhouse, Planet Terror is the more fun of the two, but suffers from overdoing its style. As a goofy sci-fi comedy, it works in its own cheesy way. Starting with some smoking bright green chemical weapons turning everyone into zombies, we quickly get introduced to an ensemble of memorable characters who promptly deliver nonsensical quips, mention half-baked backstory and kick ass in ridiculous action scenes. It's enough to make for a great film, but the number of times the film flashes ""this is a cheesy pastiche!"" in the audience's face is just too excessive, like a wannabe comedian ribbing you after every joke and asking if you thought it was funny. The point where I gave up on the film was the overtly telegraphed ""missing reel"" that shuffled around the entire roster of characters just for the sake of it, which was the equivalent of the comedian shaking you by the shoulders after their attempt at a joke.Death Proof: As the second half of the double feature Grindhouse, Death Proof is the more serious and more intense counterpart to the silly Planet Terror. Following the exploits of an insane homicidal stunt driver and parallel groups of women, it begins very slowly with Tarantino's penchant for excessive small talk as a way to get to know the characters. After a false start where the initial protagonists suddenly die, the film really kicks off when it turns into a pure car chase film with incredible tension as the other protagonists are nearly driven off the road and every swerve is a matter of life or death. The intensity is continued when they go on a Tarantino-style revenge fest, amping up the stakes and giving some much needed catharsis for the characters. It's an uneven film with uneven characterisation and suspense, but a fun ride overall.The trailers: Extraneous and best skipped.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wow! This is the most fun you will have watching a three hour movie. Cool and a double feature that's filled with it all.,"I just saw ""Grindhouse"" and I must say that this picture rocks! This is the most fun anyone will have watching a film for three hours! You name it ""Grindhouse"" has it all thrills, chills, spills, action, drama, and just plain fun. It was really a neat ideal that two directing risk takers like Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez team up to do a double feature that mostly pays homage to the classic B movie genre of horror and sci-fi. This film is certainly a tribute to the days of exploitation films and squalor. ""Grindhouse"" is split up into two movies first is Robert Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" and then it's followed by Tarantino's ""Death Proof"". It's done in an old fashioned kind of way too, starting with scratchy mismatched prints, and odd ball trailers for make believe slasher films. The best trailer is the one for the gross slasher Thanksgiving that plays the theme music and pays homage to 80's horror films like ""Creepshow"", that helps sink the audience into well respected pop culture. Then the features begin with the twirling rainbow feature presentation.First up is in my opinion the best tale ""Planet Terror"" which is portrayed in rural Texas and starts with a bang having Rose McGowan as a sexy and slick stripper, and the feel of this is done like being back into the 70's. This small town becomes the center of an all out terror in the form of flesh eating zombies that want to suck the life out of human beings and take over the nuclear weapons at the local military base, this then leads everyone involved on a wild chase of action, and the scenes done are mostly nonstop action of blood, shootings, car chases, and fighting with explosions probably the most action filled badness you will see in a movie in quite sometime. The actors in this tale don't miss a beat with good acting from Freddy Rodriguez, Josh Brolin, and Marley Shelton. And to me I like the McGowan character as to me she's an antihero a stripper who's trying to find love and fight the zombies while suffering a body part loss. Really Rodriguez gave this plenty of hyperbole like Rose McGowan ending up with a machine gun as a prosthetic leg. Now talk about a leg up on the competition! In the end ""Planet Terror"" ends as fairy tale for the small town people who conquer the blood sucking zombies, and because of the way it's done paying homage to low grade scenes of love and skin flesh it's remembered as an instant classic of perfection.Next it's Tarantino's turn with ""Death Proof"" which isn't as good, but certainly entertains and has much more of a story to it. This stars veteran Kurt Russell as a cocky stuntman who will meet his match from some sexy trash talking females(Rosario Dawson and Zoe Bell) yet the endless jabbering and talk is a bit boring and long, it's just Quentin's way of providing an appetizer before the wild two car chase! Leaving the final showdown as brutal! Really it's nice to see movies like these that provide homage to old genre classics, and they provide many laughs, thrills and entertainment enjoyment, because it doesn't take things so serious. The blood, sex, and gory like this has certainly brought the glory feel back to the movies and plus it was done in a such a cool way of a double feature by two directors who often go against the establishment with their own outspoken methods.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A fun, action packed tribute to classic 80s explotation.","Planet Terror: 7/10
Planet Terror is a gory, action packed thrill ride that is as fun as it is ridiculous.Death Proof: 6/10
While the first half is great and keeps the old grainy, sexy, violent fun, the second half falls flat and not only loses the grainyness but also the fun as it turns into a dull self indulgent Tarantino Dialouge porn. The final car chase is great and makes it still worth watching, but Death Proof is still the lesser half.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Good (Bad) Ol' Days,"Grindhouse is Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's loving tribute to 42nd Street, back when it was known as The Deuce, before Rudy Giuliani and Walt Disney ruined everything. Grindhouse is two films in one: Planet Terror, a zombie spoof; and Death Proof, a more serious stalker/car chase flick. Both films are artificially stressed to make them look aged, with scratch marks and missing reels (the sex scenes, natch). In between are fake trailers for other psychotronic fare, and commercials for disgusting concession stand food. You can almost smell the weed in the air, and feel the chewing gum underfoot.Unfortunately, audiences didn't get the joke, and the picture bombed. To recoup their losses, the studio is re-releasing Planet Terror and Death Proof as two separate movies, in extended director's cuts. Of the two, Death Proof can best stand alone as its own movie; Planet Terror is too much part of the gag to work by itself. Tarantino seems to be realizing a lifelong dream to become the world's greatest B-movie auteur. There are worse ambitions.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Two A movies in a the 70 B movie style that will leave you disturbed and laughing,"A film has never affected me like Grindhouse has. I saw a special screening of it that ended about 3 hours ago, and I am still riding it's adrenaline. Lets start with what these movies are. They are unrealistic. They are gory. They are a adrenaline trip. They are suspenseful. They are a good rendition of the 70s film style. They are hilarious.They are NOT moral inspiring or in possession of a deep inner meaning.But they are everything a good entertaining film should be.I really don't want to spoil anything for you, so I will leave you will a few closing comments. Death Proof starts slow, which for me seemed REALLY slow after the high adrenalin of Planet Terror, but then it picks right up and doesn't fail to deliver. Also, please be aware that these are two full length film with nothing in between but a few hilarious faux-trailers. Go to the washroom beforehand, get enough food and drink to last, and get comfortable. The time just whips by.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly Lame,I well remember the era of the grind house because I lived through the tail end of it.My father would take my brothers and myself to see the latest double feature and sometimes triple feature low-budget film offerings during the late seventies.The films were fun and the audience was even more amusing.I think Grindhouse seems to have created the experience with this feature film complete with trailers. I won't go deeply into why this film seemed to leave me feeling somewhat shortchanged.The first film was the better of the two.Planet Terror would actually have made a good stand-alone feature with an additional subplot.The over the top humor played it straight and made it even more amusing.Robert Rodriguez is lesser known than Quenton Tarantino but I suspect he has the lion's share of the talent at least in this film. The second feature was insufferable.I actually found myself yawning during the exposition in Death Proof.Quentin Tarantino really came up short in this one.The chick posse dialog just drove me up the wall.This slowed down the whole experience and definitely worked against my overall rating of this feature within the feature..But to be fair many double features were uneven in quality.During the eighties I would go to the Times Square row of theaters and watch double and triple features and the experience would be pretty much how I felt during Grindhouse.Perhaps this is the hidden genius of these two filmmakers.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Way too long, boring, adds nothing to the genre it copies.","I'm mostly commenting on the Rodriguez film and about 10% of Tarantino's, after that there was no way I was going to sit through all of Tarantino's interpretation of this boring idea. The problem is that the concept, making an exploitation horror pastiche, was only interesting for about 20 minutes. The first 20 minutes are somewhat amusing. But the other 90 minutes I managed to make it through were just mind-numbingly boring.This quickly turned from a commentary on the old films to just another bad horror movie, except even more boring since the plot is deliberately bad. You may as well go watch an authentic 70s horror flick instead, this one isn't any more interesting. (Actually, many real old horror/exploitation films are way smarter than Grindhouse.)This concept might have made a brilliant half-hour short film, but here it was stretched out way too thin. I don't understand how anybody can sit through a movie that deliberately has no substance for an entire three hours. Is everybody else stoned when they watch this?",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Two for the Price of One,"What an incredible rush of a movie. I played this at 2am and while I was only one of 2 people in the theater, we were still both on the edge of our seats or reacting to the film in one way or another.Rodriguez's Death Proof is a very fast paced movie and a clear homage to any Romero zombie flick out there. The pacing of the film is excellent and his casting is dead on. Freddy Rodriguz and Rose Mcgowen make the perfect pair and are both unlikely action stars. Expect a TON of zombie gore as well. I'm happy to say he embraced the camp feel of the movie w/ the print looking perfectly aged including missing reels and film burns. I've read a few times that his falls on its face compared to Tarantino's however I felt his fast paced editing and constant action or gore kept me going throughout the film.Tarantino's Death Proof was pretty well done, although at times I felt like I was watching the female version of Reservoir Dogs, and we all know his weak spot is writing female dialogue. Kurt Russel is under used however he steals every moment he's on screen. The star of the film has to be Sydney Tamiia Poitier as Jungle Julia, who delivers Tarantino's lines without flinching. While as everyone else says the film drags in the middle the two ending car chases are some of the best ever filmed and deliver the most intense moments of the movie.In addition, the fake trailers are the perfect touch, but what really stands out is Eli Roth's 'Thanksgiving' trailer. He perfectly captures old 80's slasher flicks with gore that made me cringe at times.Ultimately if you know what to expect / are a far of Tarantino's or Rodriguez's you'll place this high on your list but Joe Shmo might have trouble knowing just what to make of the film.(also as working in a theater I can't wait for complaints about the 'poor' look of the film)",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"a creative little feature full of flash, shock, and intrigue","Startling, audaciously violent double feature from cult directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino is an homage to exploitation B-movies and the grindhouse theater. The first segment Planet Terror is a campy, tongue-in-cheek zombie flick from Rodriguez centering around a handful of survivors trying to escape from a virulent biological infection. A visceral, pumped-up, amusingly gross barrage of trashy overkill done with joyous skill and craft. Tarantino's segment Death Proof is an edgy, talky story about a sadistic stuntman who butchers young women with his car. Takes time getting started, but eventually unfolds into a dark, volatile, hilariously off-the-wall chase flick with an energetic, high-octane climax that will have you on the edge of your seat. Watching this unconventional, episodic, over-the-top little feature you have to applaud the effort of the directors who seem like two rambunctious kids in a candy store. A unique, stylish movie experience; flagrantly off-putting, even self-indulgent at times, but pays off with its crackling, innovative dialogue, bizarre characters, and giddy exuberance. ***",,Anonymous,Horror
What a Cool Trip,"This is everything you would expect from this team of filmmakers. It is a campy, violent, unique homage' to the low budget horror films of the 1960's and 1970's. Everything about it fits the bill, including the way in which it is shot. A purposefully weak plot. A script filled with campy lines. Characters that are more caricatures. It is all so well done. What is also amazing is how this film is so ahead of the Zombie craze that followed with series like ""The Walking Dead"" and movies like, ""Last Train to Busan"". This has a terrific cast, all who are in on the joke. The special effects are great. Harder to make in 2007 than it would be today.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Death Proof Just too long solo,As lam an avid fan of Tarantino movies with the likes of Reservoir Dogs & Pulp Fiction I was slightly disappointed with Death Proof. Maybe due to the fact it has been released here in the UK as one film rather than Double Feature with Planet Terror I felt it was way too long. The action sequences where excellent and so was the acting but for me there seemed to be too much dialogue as if to drag the film out longer. I only hope that a DVD release of this movie will be cut and have Planet Terror with it as originally intended. As ever I wait in anticipation for more Tarantino films as the mans a legend and surely deserves an Oscar.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great fun.,"I didn't know what to expect from Grindhouse when I decided to go, but this turned out to be the most fun I've had at a movie in a good while. The trailers are outrageous and hilarious. Planet Terror was a laugh-out-loud hoot that got a round of applause from people in attendance. I thought that Death Proof caused the audience to lose a little energy as it was very ""talky"" at times, but it was still very entertaining. This movie is a testament to the creativity of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino and their interest in bringing in other creative film makers such as Rob Zombie to join in the fun. Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind a little fake blood and gore.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tarentino brings the comedic violence and long dialog,"Grindhouse makes for an interesting set of 2 films. The first one, Planet Terror by Rodrigues, is the better of the 2 films. It is filled with comedic violence and gore. A gas is released that turns people into zombies. Cherry a hot dancer is attacked and taken to the hospital by Wray. She loses her leg from the attack and Wray so elegantly makes her a stump. At the hospital we meet a mean doctor and his cheating wife. The dead are starting to turn into zombies and we get some nice gore shots. The chase leads to a restaurant and a stand off between survivors and the dead. It's great fun.Tarentino's film, Death Proof, doesn't have a lot of action but lots of dialog about interesting silly things. It's like how you would imagine real conversations. It's a Tarentino trademark. The ending is just so right also, with the girls ganging up on Stuntman Mike.FINAL VERDICT: It has some uniqueness about it.

A Fond Trip Down Memory Lane,"I'll admit 2 things right off the bat: I was a consummate fan of the old 42nd Street grindhouses & drive ins & the fare they showed. I fondly remember skipping school to catch a triple feature. My all time perfect grindhouse experience was skipping school on a rainy lousy day with several friends of mine & kicking back with some lousy wine a few joints & a triple feature of THE WARRIORS, ENTER THE DRAGON and THE AVENGING DISCO GODFATHER.The other thing I'll admit is that I am total Tarantino fanboy. I enjoy his work even though I really get tired of him. He does stuff that I shouldn't likeie he makes movies about moviesbut I end up loving them. I really detest his clones & after every one of his movies we are inundated with bad copycats. But I have enjoyed each feature film he has made.So GRINDHOUSE seems to be made just for me! DEATHPROOF, Tarantino's half of GRINDHOUSE demonstrates why he is so far above his peers. He takes a hoary genrethe car chase flick--& infuses it with something new, much like Sergio Leone did with the western back in the 1960s. DEATHPROOF is the best drive in movie never made in 1975. As with RESERVIOUR DOGS he writes the scenes we never got to see in genre flicks, scenes where the characters reveal things about themselves, scenes where they set the action in motion, scenes where we see the aftermath.DEATHPROOF also contains a car chase scene that is right up there with THE FRENCH CONNECTION & the 7 UPS. The first part of DEATHPROOF is the rapid fire dialogue between the characters & the second part is the rapid fire action of a psychopath & a car of women bent on revenge. Tarantino doesn't just send up or copy the car chase flick of the 1970she makes a really good one. Unlike Ridrigues' half of GRINDHOUSE, Tarantino does not degrade the film's image of scratch the print. DEATHPROOF looks like a brand new 1970s car chase flick right down to the soft focus.Now about the rest of the film. As I'm sure most of you know, GRINDHOUSE is actually 2 full length (80 minutes) features, plus fake coming attractions. Rodriguez's PLANET TERROR is a mildly amusing send up of a zombie flick. This is the part of GRINDHOUSE where the film is scratched, it hiccups & burns. It's non stop action with no character development& is basically just a new version of a bad old movie. Whereas Tarantino injects a genre with something new Rodriguez simply takes a stroll down memory lane & is every bit as witless as most of the flicks I used to see at the real 42nd Street grindhouses.The fake trailers are hit or miss. Eli Roth's THANKSGIVING is outrageous & hilarious as is a trailer for a bad 70s Euro horror DON'T.So is GRINDHOUSE worth seeing? Well I had a great 3 hours & 15 minutes. The only time I got antsy was during the last 10 minutes of Rodriguez's PLANET TERROR. But if you aren't fond of this type of fare & if Tarantino generally leaves you cold then I guess there are better ways to spend 3 hours.What wasn't so funny was a real trailer that I saw before GRINDHOUSE: apparently Rob Zombie has remade John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN. From the trailer its apparent that this is a non stop gore show & the tagline for the film is ""an extreme update of the old classic"". So what they've done is take a great old thriller that was heavy on scares but light on actual gore & have stripped it of it's humanity, added gore & torture & have created just another sick millennial stalk, torture & mutilate flick. I've caught both of Zombie's previous celluloid atrocities & found them to be nothing more than bad torture porn.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody Hilarious!,"Really bloody hilarious! What a concept to do 2 in 1, and while they didn't have a lot in common (other than actors), they were perfectly matched. The 3+ hours went by in a flash.

It took a few minutes to really zero in on the humor but I laughed just about all the way through this segment. Then came feature number 2, Death Proof. Kurt Russell's portrayal of Stuntman Mike was startling, to say the least. He was disarmingly wicked. The chase scene was incredible and the actresses in the car had their characters down cold - really out there, really on the edge! This was great film and I'm happy about getting to see it.

At times painfully predictable, it is nevertheless very enjoyable, packing a fresh Tarantino punch.""Planet Terror"" is a typical zombie apocalypse flick, wielding an impressive arsenal of absurdly funny and/or bizarre moments - from Naveen Andrews' collection of certain bodily organs through Jeff Fahey's very amusing role to Tarantino's short, but memorable appearance.Watch both of them for pure pulp enjoyment.

Double feature from Tarantino,"Grindhouse is two movies separated by a short, fake upcoming attraction Machete, which was later made into a real film a few years later. I'll start with Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror first, which is a parody of the old science fiction zombie thriller's of the 60s and 70s. Rose McGown is Cherry Darling, a go go dancer wanting a change in her life. A scientist attempts to sell a deadly gas to a military guy and during a fight a chemical is released turning the public into flesh eating ghouls. Cherry and her boyfriend, El Ray become leaders fighting the evil dead. A bit bloody, but Rodriguez has an off beat sense of humorous, so it works.The second feature is Death Proof, Quentin Tarantino's tribute to Vanishing Point, even having the same Dodge Charger for a chase scene. Kurt Russell is stunt driver, Mike, who stalks a group of women in a specially built death proof, super reinforced car. The girls wind up in a demolition derby type of battle with the psychopath and the script is overly verbose, even by Tarantino's usual standards. This is not one his better works.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Where I still enjoyed watching the Kill Bill movies a lot (despite some debatable tackiness), movies like Hostell are too extreme for me, I think it is just plain sick.

I Could Smell The 70's,"I really liked Grindhouse. I've seen it twice in the same week and got more out of the story(s) the second time around, (I get that most of the time with QT's movies). The cast was chosen very well in both movies. The movie plots were as fluid as the blood, gore, and gasoline that flowed through out the two movies. From the pops and scratches of the celluloid film stock, the cheesy 70's horror trailers and the petal to the metal classic car chases I thought I was in a time warp back to the 70's. Better buy the big bag of popcorn and use the bathroom before take this hip trip back in time when b-movies were king and polyester was an understatement. Thanks RR and QT for the sweet two-hour plus ride down memory lane.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
this is a great  movie!,"this movie is as great as i expected it would be. i was weary of sitting through two movies, but they were so great that i didn't notice the time i spent at the theater. Grind House is definitely worth watching! this movie was worth every penny spent. go watch grind house. now! go! you will love it if you like ultra violent movies. grind house is better than sin city and that says a lot. Tarentino never lets us down. go see it! all of my friends enjoyed it as well.why do i need to have at least ten lines of text just to give a review? i don't have enough to say without spoiling the movie. it's the perfect mix of chicks, Bruce Willis, gun, and car chases. chicks, man, chicks!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Enough To Be Called Epic!,"Rodriguez and Tarantino join forces to make a homage to exploitation films of the 70's and 80's. This film turns out to be one of the best films I have ever seen. The whole movie is very long because there are two films: Planet Terror and Death Proof. Also, at the beginning and between the films are fake trailers by Rob Zombie, Eli Roth, and Robert Rodriguez. My favorite being Eli Roth's THANKSGIVING.PLANET TERROR...is the first film. It's a zombie film. People are infected and eaten all through the film. It is filled with over the top violence and gore. It evens has some very funny moments thrown in for fun. My favorite character is Cherry Darling - the stripper with the machine gun for a leg! There is a lot of gore and disturbing scenes. Overall Planet Terror is a great nonstop action/zombie flick.DEATH PROOF...is, of course, the second film. It is about Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) a man who kills people using his Chevy Nova and Dodge Charger (one is crashed). He attempts to kill a group of young girls test driving a car, but fails. The girls then proceed to get bloody revenge on Mike. Although, it does not have nonstop action as the first, it is still great. This film has better character development than Planet Terror. Death Proof also has one of the best car chase scenes ever! Everyone in my theater was cheering on The Girls at the end of the film.This film is worth every penny. It may even be the most entertaining film of the year. This film is on my DVD buying list.",,Anonymous,Horror
Grindhouse (2007) **1/2,"Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez here have paid homage to their favorite old ""B"" films of the 1970s with this inspired package, which essentially comprises two feature films - one from Tarantino, one from Rodriguez - that are in the same fun spirit of Saturday afternoon matinée shows that used to play in theaters back in the day. Back then, you got to see two exploitive movies for the price of one, and these were accompanied by off the wall trailers for other weird movies and they would be premiered before the first flick and then later before the second film began. So basically I am rating this as a whole presentation containing everything including the kitchen sink. If I were to rate the two films individually, I'd say that both were a little disappointing for me (**1/2 each) from what I would have expected, but that Quentin Tarantino's movie is a hair better.Both directors did a fine job of achieving the feel of an old-time grindhouse double feature, complete with adding dirt and scratches to the film prints and other visual imperfections; this also includes apologies for reels that are ""missing"", broken sprockets, and even a film burn. The very amusing and vintage-looking faux trailers which are sprinkled around for would-be movies include fun titles like: ""DON'T"" (my favorite), ""THANKSGIVING"", ""WEREWOLF WOMEN OF THE S.S."", and ""MACHETE"".PLANET TERROR (**1/2) is the first proper movie that unspools, and it's Robert Rodriguez's gory zombie film about a little Texas town which is overrun by disease due to a chemical outbreak. This results in munching ghouls running around attacking people in a spirited and bloody splatterfest, but the problem for me was that none of it struck me as anything very new, and I felt I'd already seen this type of wham-bam-shoot-em-up thing plenty of times before. So then the problem became that after some time I grew tired of this routine and grew restless, wishing the film would end already and that I could see the Tarantino feature start (which is not the feeling a film like PLANET TERROR should give you). It's certainly a better-than-usual zombiefest, but I don't need to see this one again. Oh, I probably will experience it again somewhere in my future, but it'll probably be in someone else's repetitious zombie movie. I didn't have any interest in a single character in PLANET TERROR and that didn't help me care about what was going on very much. The one ingredient I enjoyed was Rose McGowan as a go go dancer who loses a leg and has it replaced with a machine gun; seeing her determined and hobbling about on one false gun leg before lifting it up in order to angrily spray her enemies with gunfire was a kick! Another thing -- way too much dependency on modern CGI stuff for what's supposed to be a ""grindhouse film"". At least it was better than George Romero's recent LAND OF THE DEAD.Quentin Tarantino proves the better director with his DEATH PROOF (**1/2), but it's still not among what I'd call his ""greatest"" works. I thought his choice of Kurt Russell in this picture (after he originally wanted Mickey Rourke) worked out wonderfully. Russell plays a has-been stunt driver from past TV days who calls himself ""Stuntman Mike"", and he drives an old car that has been souped up to sustain all types of abuse and is virtually ""death proof"". He hangs around the bars to try and schmooze with young girls, but once he gets them into his deadly car for a ride, that's when his dark and psychopathic tendencies erupt. It was a lot of fun to see Russell in this part which he seemed perfectly suited for. He's terrific in the movie and it's an asset to have him in it. Again I liked Tarantino's choice of music for his feature and his slow pacing at least works to give the first grisly sequence of the film a very powerful impact. As a Tarantino fan I always look forward to his clever dialogue, but I have to say he came up empty in that department this time; I wouldn't call the uninteresting conversations here between his female characters anywhere near his best, and these talking scenes do at times feel like they go on waayyyyyy too long. On top of this, the female characters aren't very intriguing and sometimes one or two of them can even be downright annoying. While Quentin's taste in music has always been damn good, it's just hard for me to believe that these young girls would ever be as into these outdated oldies to the extent of knowing the words to ""Baby It's You"" or eagerly quoting the names of ""Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Titch""! This just smacks of Tarantino's own self-indulgence, and doesn't seem genuine coming from today's youth. Without adding spoilers here I have to say that I felt some nagging loose ends were left dangling after Quentin's movie was over, and it ended too abruptly without closure, for me.I'm already hearing that there may be longer versions of both movies released in the future, and that the two films may be released individually in some markets. That sort of kills the point, but in the case of longer cuts I think PLANET TERROR already feels plenty long enough, but maybe it might actually be improved with more material and perhaps more questions answered. **1/2 out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant ... but a little Boring,"This movie brilliantly spoofs the cheesy horror/revenge/action movies of the 1970s. The number and quality of stylisms they recreate is dazzling. However, the movie is almost too true to form in that it just wasn't very compelling to watch.Basically, the film consists of two, separate 90 minute movies. It is presented in a style reminiscent of double-feature low-budget exploitation-action films of 1970s. It is shown with fictional ""previews"" of upcoming attractions and even the look of faded and scarred film.The first movie deals with an alien/zombie fest while the second involves a crazed stuntman who assaults people using his car.The effort the filmmakers made to fill the movie with numerous old-style movie clichés is amazing. Without a doubt, they are fun to watch. However, they cannot make up for uninteresting storytelling. Neither story was compelling - either in plot or characters. I was never once curious about what was going to happen next or who was going to live or die. That's not good.Maybe the makers of this film went too far with emulating the dull movies they were spoofing; we're faced with 3+ hours of dull storytelling. If you're pop-culture fan of the '70s, this is definitely worth watching. For everyone else, the best way to see it is through snippets.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Perfect movie, but hoping to answer some questions.","After hours of research, reading people's opinions, reading up on actual ""grindhouseal""-era movies, this is my explanation of the movie and why the two differed so greatly. Robert Rodriguez was introduced to grind-house cinema only about a year before actually writing this movie. He had no real background or knowledge of the old movies. He had only really watched a couple with Tarantino. Therefore, the movie ""Planet Terror"" is his initial response to the sparse viewing of grind-house material. It was put in front as an ""appetizer"" or a ""hook"" so that people would actually buy tickets. The movie was heavily focused on gore, action, and sex because he was going all out. He was making an ""all in one"", ""here it is, BAM!!!"" kind of attempt. The movie was shown first to keep the general moviegoer entertained and in awe. ""Oooh blood! Explosions! Boobs!"". ""Death Proof"" was the movie that is supposed to actually represent grind-house cinema exactly the way it was back in the 70s. The reason for the representation of long, endless, chit-chat pointless dialog is because in the heyday of G.H., the filmmakers had as much budget for these movies as I have in my wallet. They filled up about 70-80% of the movie with the main characters' (who were mostly empowered (and occasionally black) women) dialog of whatever they were talking about. The remainder scenes, with action or blood or effects or all, took all the budget these movies had. They couldn't afford anymore. To tell you the truth, old G.H. movies, after looking them up, actually suck big balls. They really are B-level movies to the core, and only have a glossy finish because lots of horror and action directors cite them as a big influence. They were boring. The only redeeming quality was finally seeing the ""bad guy"" or seeing a stabbing or blood (hint hint sound familiar?) or death. Everyone pretty much agrees that going to ""D.P."" after ""P.T."" was a steep drop in terms of entertainment, but to look at the movies subjectively, ""D.P."" was the truer movie, and the more successful in the aspect of showing what the old G.H. cinema really was. And I would complain about the cell phone bits, but again, in the 70s, they didn't feature cell phones because they didn't have them. They did feature whatever technology was available, like the latest cars. Anyway, back to the point. Everyone says what they want, but I am now convinced about the certain ""holes in the fabric"" between the two movies, and the initial apparent void in logical continuity putting the two movies together. I am happy. I'm not happy that no one liked ""D.P."", therefore, not unlike Nazi (not using it negatively, just saying the first thing I could think of) propaganda, you just eventually conform to everyone else's opinions, which means that I don't like ""D.P."" as much as when we first saw it (I freakin loved it right after I saw it), just because everyone's coming down on it so hard, it's hard to like it, like someone makes a point to why it sucked, and I say ""well, that is true, hmmm..."" and eventually, you don't like it, you know? But now that I understand why this movie was like this and that movie was like that, I can comfortably start to grow my liking for ""Death Proof"" again, just as an ideal and homage to grind-house cinema. Also, keep in mind before you start to rebuttal about me being dumb for liking a movie that sucked, I am saying this as my opinion subjectively: ""Planet Terror"" was an exponentially more entertaining and well-paced movie than was ""Death Proof"". That's out of the way. On the other hand, I do like ""Death Proof"" just slightly more, just because of the more idealistic, stylistic, and traditional approach to the movie and characters themselves. I put every possible thought into explaining this phenomenon that is ""Grindhouse"", and I also hope you, the reader, recognized my attempt to be rational and unbiased, obviously with my statement that ""Planet Terror"" really was the better-produced movie. And I'm not guessing or crap-shooting or being a ""fanboy"", I researched this, starting from the night I saw the movie, and everything here is either paraphrased from a quote from a respectable source, an actual quote, or, when precursed by a statement of mine, is my own personal opinion. I'm not trying to win an argument, I'm trying to give an explanation the best way I can. Also, I'm not proclaiming to understand grind-house cinema, I was just quoting, but didn't feel like citing or putting quotes anyway. I guess that's it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Two films that wouldn't even play at the grindhouse,"The term ""Grindhouse"" is now a marketing tool because few people seem to know its meaning. There are exploitation films, and then there are so-called grindhouse films. Films in both categories were mostly made with extremely LOW BUDGETS! And that was part of their ""charm"". They were outrageous and entertaining but not too slick like Hollywood films.Exploitation films, which range from John Carpenter or Friday the 13th kind of horror films to ultra violent action films, like Karate or Blaxploitation films, were, for the most part, widely distributed but mainly played in various specific theaters that rarely ran big, grade A Hollywood movies. Then there are the grindhouse films, which only played in specific movie theaters, mostly quasi-porno theaters, a mix of porn and ultra trashy and violent films. Films like NEW YORK RIPPER, BLOODSUCKING FREAKS or CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST played in those theaters, along with the x-rated stuff. Real grindhouse films contained a good amount of sex and violence AND sexualized violence.This new film, which combines two films as a double feature (which were very common back then) are more exploitation films than grindhouse films. If you think anything in GRINDHOUSE can compete with something like NEW YORK RIPPER, well, you're just kidding yourselves. It's not even funny. And that's why all of this is so effin wrong. The filmmakers just chickened out and created modestly trashy and yet EXPENSIVE retro horror/action films which would not even play at real grindhouse theaters. In the end, Quentin and Rodriguez show very little respect for a genre that they say they worship. They WISH this overdirected film could be seen in the same league as those classic trashy films.Why spend $100 million for something this generic? People at Troma must be laughing at the excess of it all.If you see this movie, see it for Rose McGowan (which is why I rate this 4 stars) but aside from her, there's no point of seeing this useless homage when you could rent or buy DVDs or even out-of-print videos of real grindhouse films and experience the real thing first hand. Not this fake overdone and over-hyped stuff.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Only for TRUE fans!,"This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The whole 3+ hours went by too fast for me, filled with the most hilarious scenes! For those of you who don't find the humor in the overuse of blood and gore then you definitely won't like Planet Terror. If you can think about a go-go dancer with a machine gun for a leg without laughing, you will not find this movie entertaining. Death Proof on the other hand is less about gore and more about clever set up, which is exactly what QT is known for. Some people fail to realize the genius behind a 15 minute scene of great dialogue that is captured in one continuous shot. The pure skill of every actor is used for every part in Terror Proof. Hell, even Kurt Russel is amazing in this movie! For everyone else who doesn't enjoy that there is a phenomenal car chase scene with some very difficult stunts and great action. All in all it was everything I could ever expect from a double feature. I would recommend this double feature to any horror movie lover in an instant!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
get ready to overdose on fun,"Planet Terror, the first segment of Grindhouse, is without a doubt the goriest thing I've ever seen. I also can't remember the last time I laughed so hard at the movies. It's the most gleefully over-the-top spectacle I've ever witnessed. As the heroine, Rose McGowan is precisely on director Robert Rodriguez's wavelength, and Michael Biehn makes excellent fun of the type of character he's played in a dozen 'C' movies. This succeeds everywhere From Dusk Til Dawn failed.Maybe I would've appreciated Death Proof more if it had come first. For the first time, Quentin Tarantino's love affair with talk grates a little as you wait for his movie to get into gear. After the adrenaline shot of Planet Terror, it's hard to slow down to a crawl for half an hour while this segment sets itself up. It's as though he couldn't give himself completely over to the grindhouse aesthetic - he had to try to be clever, and that makes some of the dialogue stick out like a sore thumb. That being said, though, there is plenty of fun and edge-of-your-seat suspense to keep you interested.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Worth your money, if you enjoy cinema","Rodriguez & Tarantino together for a film that glorifies grind house cinema. Only the pair that brought you Miramax Films and Dimension Films, the Weinstein brothers, would dare to fund a dream this large.And Grindhouse works. It doesn't work in an, ""omg this is the best movie ever!"" way. Rather, it works as a homage to schlock seventies cinema. A solid tip of the hat, from 2 masters, having fun at what they do. Providing a nice touch of atmosphere throughout the movie, are trailers and little easter eggs. Complete with missing frames and grainy aging filters applied to the film print.Grindhouse isn't meant to be taken serious or as serious work from either director.Anyone that goes into this experience expecting Pulp Fiction or Sin City won't have fun. The overall effect is just short of brilliance. As it was intended to be.Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" seems to have fared the worst of the two pictures in early reviews. Those reviews are flawed. Planet Terror is a hell of a ride for anyone that experienced the splash & splatter films of the late 1970 to mid 1980's. Rodriguez uses laughs and gore and absurd images to assault your senses. If you've ever recited dialog from a cult movie when among friends, this movie is for you.Tarantino decided to take on the road exploitation film. ""Death Proof"" falls a little short of the mark. The first act either misses the mark entirely or runs a hair long, that will just depend on your viewpoint. The pacing during the first act can be slow. Strap in for the last 2 acts, you will get intimately acquainted with Death Race, Duel, Vanishing Point, and Gone in 60 seconds. Not the remake, the 1974 version.Death Proof is filled with Tarantino dialog that makes the process worthwhile. Deliberate and intentional with methodical pacing this vehicle idles at times. And throttles to the floor at other times. Kurt Russell steals the scenes in bursts.Grindhouse as whole might be a little much for the average film goer to absorb in one sitting. Rodriguez & Tarantino aren't for the average film patron though. And you certainly aren't the average film patron. Otherwise, why would you read an article about Rodriguez & Tarantino, hosted on a site devoted to theater? Break out your wallet and prepare to get retro, if for only 3 hours.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Bloated, mean-spirited co-effort...","Replicating not only the look and sound but also--and most especially--the ambiance of the drive-in double-features prevalent in the 1970s, filmmakers Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino took a gamble with their bloated co-effort ""Grindhouse"", each taking a writing and directing credit on their own entries while co-producing each other's work. Neither film (augmented with 'worn' reels and sloppy jump cuts) is particularly strong plot-wise; however, both movies are incredible solely as visceral experiences, offering a lot of fun for select audiences.PLANET TERROR **1/2 from ****
The first half of the bill is Rodriguez's messy splatter flick ""Planet Terror"" (originally entitled ""Project Terror"", which makes more sense). Unspooling in the manner of George A. Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead, it is the weaker of the two projects. Mass quantities of a deadly biochemical gas are released into the air, turning citizens into marauding zombies; an unlikely band of survivors fights back, led by a cocky-cool modern-day gunfighter and his stripper-girlfriend, who turns the horrible loss of her right leg to everyone's advantage. There's much to enjoy here visually, yet the plot-mechanics and characters fail to emerge due to Rodriguez's empty-headed script, which is amusing on occasion (intentionally so) but more often than not merely silly.DEATH PROOF **1/2 from ****
Tarantino's film ""Death Proof"" is a curiously mean-spirited action-thriller which draws its inspirations from psychobilly programmers such as ""Dirty Mary Crazy Larry"", ""White Line Fever"", ""Duel"", ""Vanishing Point"" and ""Satan's Cheerleaders"". Emulating these popular auto smash-ups, Tarantino shows his love for the drive-in classics without transcending them (some fans have looked for deeper meanings in ""Death Proof""--and some are still digging). Tarantino's budget, of course, far exceeds those of the B-flicks he's replicating, and so comparisons to ""Dirty Mary Crazy Larry"" are not really relevant. No filmmaker in the '70s ever made movies like Tarantino makes them now; his craftsmanship behind the camera is singular, though he cherry-picks movie (and movie-music) references for his own enjoyment--sometimes preciously. A former television stuntman in a black Dodge Charger stalks and taunts women--and just about seems above the law and retribution until he picks on the wrong group of girls. Utilizing a few of the actors and characters from ""Planet Terror"", Tarantino has just as high a time profiling the people within his film as he does dispatching them via his resident maniac. His dialogue crackles with a keenly precise ear, although his lack of sympathy can be jarring (there are one or two flashes of beauty, although how honest they are is up for debate). The bloody finale is a slug-fest celebration, yet ""Death Proof"", for the most part, isn't really enjoyable; it's edgy and mean--and has a dirty streak that coats the picture with unpleasantness. Some say that's just Tarantino doing his job, but I found the results to be a gut-cruncher.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
An interesting event and an equally interesting legacy,"As it was written on Wikipedia: there are 2 films in the set and trailers between them. Separately, I don't really like this whole mess of everything. Death Proof is one of Tarantino's worst films. The only thing worse is to kill Bill, but I don't impose my opinion on anyone. Planet of Fear is a good movie, but somehow I don't want to review it a year after watching it. The trailers, by the way, are really funny. They can also be viewed separately.But here's the whole thing. Like some kind of event in the world of cinema. It's not often that 7 directors, 6 of whom are no matter who, get together and shoot such a Frankenstein out of pieces! Therefore, if he sits down and watches it all in a row, then there are 7 \ 10 points. Separately, something is 6\10, something is 5\10.And the most important advantage of this 2007 event is that the trailers shot as if in jest after that turned out to be full-fledged films.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Grindhouse exploits its modern B-movie experience through a bloody expressionistic tribute.,"Two feature films. Four fictional trailers (five if you're lucky...). And an authentic conceptual presentation of the 70s exploitation genre, missing reels and all. Rodriguez/Tarantino's admiration for cinema in general is tangible. Both a credible experiment in genre resurrection and a fetish for babes, blood and bolted machine gun legs. It is, at its core, a retrospective piece of entertainment. But does the double feature presentation, trailers included, work as a solid film in itself? Yes. Just about.Two of the four fictitious trailers worked. Wright's 'Don't' replicated the essence of Hammer Film Productions perfectly with a quintessential amount of British campiness to illustrate the ghoulish plot. Not to mention the laugh out loud vagueness of the title. Roth's (yes, this is surprising...) was another hilarious trailer with 'Thanksgiving', a holiday-themed slasher. Imitating existing features, such as 'Halloween', to deliver a barrage of nudity and decapitations. Absurd, yet sadistically amusing. These two especially suited the overall aesthetic of Grindhouse, particularly with 'Planet Terror'. Rodriguez' 'Machete', which later became a feature film', summoned the desolate heat of the Mexploitation sub-genre. It's fine. Occasionally becomes lost in itself when Trejo is randomly throwing machetes everywhere. Zombie's efforts in 'Werewolf Women of the SS' (I know...) didn't work for me. The concept felt like he was trying way too hard in being over-the-top and radical by merging a bunch of sets together. Intentional or not, it juxtaposed the other trailers. Cage as Fu Manchu though, I want more! Although varying in quality, these trailers do provide impressive contributions to the overall presentation and are embedded intricately before each feature film.Speaking of features, do both 'Planet Terror' and 'Death Proof' work as a project of duality? No. The former is an absurdist's perspective of the zombie genre, whereas the latter just resembled an ordinary Tarantino flick without the excessive exploitation. The two, together, have different paces, styles and tones which exhume varying levels of contrast, diminishing the whole feature's flow.There's plenty of passion and heart being injected into this project, ultimately resulting in an enjoyable cinematic experience. Yet a prevention exists that disallows me from fully connecting to the concept. A myriad of pastiches, with varying levels of quality, as opposed to an actual presentation. I'd watch it again just for 'Death Proof'...",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Faster, Faster, kill, kill, Fun, fun","FIRST. PLANET TERROR. Rogriguez just lets rip on this thing from the word go. the first 30 half of this movie is covered in the kind of grind house filth that will either get you wet or make you get up and leave. Rodriguez is seriously hanging his balls out with this one, lesbians making out, heads exploding, ball bags melting, torsos torn apart, he certainly took his assignment and just covered it with the most over the top S*** you'll ever see.But oddly enough, hes right at home, this is the kind of thing you can tell thats been brewing in Robert since Desperado. exercising all of his inner demons. its like a monkey thats been in a cage to long, then suddenly released to go crazy in the zoo.The first and seconds acts move along at break neck speed daring you to take a breather. were introduced to a bunch of characters, all amazingly different with great performances to boot, but no plot. still its an wildly the most entertaining thing you'll see for a while at the movies. ironically its the beginning of the third act, were things slow down to focus of plot, were the film suffers. for all its bravado, it becomes less daring. the finally will have you thinking I've seen this kind of thing a hundred times.A few break out stars with this this one, notably Rose McGowen. shes a goddess, and when you see the opening credits, your gonna wish you had the DVD just so you can hit that slow mo button. DAME.TRAILERS- Don't and THANKGIVING need to be feature lengths. thats all that has to be said.DEATH PROOF. Tarantino's half, the whole movie is a through back to not only grind house cinema, but what qt does best, close ups on bare feet, long tracking shots, long dialogue scenes followed by quick bursts of action. its everything his mastered rolled into one movie. people are complaining about Quentin getting serious again and stop messing around with genre throwbacks. well. . his made a entire career out it. Reserviour Dogs and Pulp Fiction were throwbacks to the french new wave crime movies. and this is his nod to grind house cinema.As always there's very little plot going on, but its rich with character study. it moves slow in places but Patience is the key as you'll soon be rewarded. its Quentin's plan to easy you in, were hanging out with a bunch of girls teasing guys, talking about sex, and drinking wild turkey shots, all apart of his master plan until, the horror finally awaits our characters.The movie plays out like a Spaggetti western, especially the scenes featuring antagonist Stuntman Mike. (played to perfection by Kurt Russel) his whole introduction, the way his shot, the way he moves, the huge scar down his face, his like character transported straight from a Sergio Leone movie. even the music is full of that heavy twang guitar riffs that resembles Morrocine.Death proof is split in two literally, down the middle were treated to a bit of Earl Mcgraw. never a bad thing. its basically a long exposition scene, explaining Mikes motives.(think the ending of PSYCHO). When were introduced to a new set of girls the movie throws away the slasher movie conventions, and takes on a whole new breath of life. the girl gang movie.Unfortunately we don't get enough of mike here, instead Tarantino forgets abouts him all together, focusing on the girls and there lives. once again things take a while to get going, but this time its not helped by Zoe Bell who. . . cant act. however she more then makes up for it when you see her on the bonnet of that car. WOW.Tarantino's movie will definitely last longer, its a film that will get better with repeated viewing. overall, despite what you've heard, it deserves a place right next to any of his other movies.

"Don't see movies like this anymore, it's a pretty darn good experience and for the most part fun","I gotta admit the reason I went to theaters in order to watch this back to back feature film was cause one of the film ""Death Proof"" is directed by Quentin Tarantino. And to my surprise I enjoyed watching ""Planet Terror"" directed by Robert Rodriguez more. It just had that exploitation film feel to it and was more entertaining to watch all the outrageous and zombie mayhem that happens on screen. ""Death Proof"" on the other hand is a self indulgent film, which I usually don't complain about but when I first watch it, it was pretty dull. With it's endless dialogue that wasn't that intriguing or interesting, and Tarantino is known for writing some amazing and immersive dialogues. The second time I watched ""Death Proof"" though I got to appreciating the film a bit more. So yeah ""Planet Terror"" started out with a bang and was just great to watch some of the crazy stuff on screen although some stuff just didn't make any sense and was really random. But that was how horror/exploitation films were like, even if this film had a budget of $53 million, when those grindhouse theater films was a lot cheaper. I also liked how it purposely has the damaged and aged effects in the film, the unconventional techniques made it feel like your watching one of those exploitation/horror films from the 70's well at least sort of. In theaters I wished the movie had intermissions, yeah it has fake trailers where you could go take a break and not miss the movie parts, but I really wanted to watch all the fake trailers as well. As a double feature film, it really is worth the price of admission. But if you separate the film and if it wasn't a back to back double feature film, than it's worth just renting it. I don't know how many of the fake trailers is going to be a full feature films. Since ""Machete"" is now a full feature film and all, but looking forward to other ones as well. I am also glad Quentin decided to become a director instead of an actor, cause he is just a terrible actor although his cameo was somewhat interesting. The other actors and actresses that shows up for the fake trailers and both the movies or at least a cameo was a pretty cool idea though.7.9/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
In one week I've seen it three times!,"Movies are supposed to entertain and this movie does just that.The trailers are some of the most funny things i've seen in a long time. I hope they make them all in to real films.Planet Terror is what a zombie film should be. With a soundtrack that could kill this movie might possibly be my new favorite movie.Deathproof has some of the best dialog i've seen in a movie ever. Just watch peoples expressions, things going on in the background, and how many things were shot with no camera cuts. The car scenes are absolutely incredible.Can't wait to catch Machete on DVD!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
great homage,"This starts with Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror and finishes with Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof. There are fake trailers and commercial before each feature. Each feature has its own value but what is the value of watching the whole thing together. Of course, this is a homage to the old drive-ins, discount-theaters double-bills. In that sense, watching the entire run has that added value. I would have liked for Tarantino to double-down on that idea. He could have shortened the features and concentrated more on the trailers. I would have loved to have some real trailers and commercials from the era. I don't know if the rights issue would prevent that. It would be like the end of ""Cinema Paradiso"" where the character watches snippets of old movie kisses. As it is, this is a great homage to the cinematic past.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bringing movies back,"Saw Grindhouse on opening day....wow....it blew me away. Perhaps it was just luck, but my audience seemed to appreciate truly original movies as much as me. I've never seen so many people cheer, laugh and cry out in pure disgust. It was amazing. They had no borders they wouldn't cross and weren't afraid of anything which is exactly what we all wanted. Both films were truly art no doubt about that. Planet Terror which its various ways of death and gore. Death Proof with its amazing car chases and at times hilarious dialog.Go see this movie...it will remind you of the good old days and the good new days still to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Planet Terror was Amazing, but Death Proof was not Suck Proof","I heard this morning that they were considering separating the segments into 2 separate films, since many people don't have the patience to watch a 3hr+ movie. Having heard this i had to see the too of them together, for the full experience.Planet Terror is the clear winner of the two. It was everything i could have ever asked for and more, it was cheesy, gory, and action packed fun. Death Proof on the other hand started off great, but then turned into crap. Now i know they were going for cheesy far fetched non-stop action, but that the ending was a joke. i had to knock off a whole star because of it. :oP After the movie i came up with an ending for Death Proof, that would have made this the best movie of all time. If you would like to hear it, message me on myspace or something www.myspace.com/omrsbrightsideoDurning the mock intermission they played some previews for mock up and coming films and i have to saw i would freakin love to see ""Nazi WereWolf Women of the SS"" and ""Thanksgiving"" Overall i still loved the movie, at least the first 2.5 hours.I highly recommend it, it is a must see in your lifetime kind of movie. :o]",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fresh And Exciting,"When i first walked in to see Grindhouse i was kind of expecting a bloody outtake on the old movies, a kind of, shaun of the dead kind of thing. The first movie, Planet Terror by Robert Rodriguez kind of played along to it. It was fun, and bloody, and funny in some parts, but altogether, nothing earth shattering. There were some pretty good fighting scenes and the over all show was enjoyable. After watching the first one, and reading numerous reviews that said the first part was much better than the second by Tarantino, I wasn't overly excited to stay. But being a dedicated QT fan i had to stay. And i will say, i was pleasantly surprised. It starts out a little slow but then quickly picks up speed. It has all the same characteristics of a QT film, witty conversation, and odd ball acting etc. But almost a new element of excitement. He masters the suspense and tension in this film. Your always on the edge of your seat, anticipating the next scene. A long car chase scene, that i wont go in to detail about, but, it brings the same dramatic excitement as the drug over dose scene in Pulp Fiction, and the Torture scene of Reservoir Dogs. And at the end, i found i enjoyed Tarantinos Death Proof much more than Planet Terror, but when i walked out of the theatre, i felt fulfilled, and just a little more bad ass than i felt walking in.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Double feature scores double,"I have never been a fan of Quentin Tarantino's work. It is not because I have really seen his work and decided I did not like it. I had long heard about the gore in his movies and avoided them for fear of not being able to handle it. I have seen only one of his movies (From Dusk to Dawn) so when I was invited to see Grindhouse, I figured I would give it a shot and hoped the gore would not get to me. (Mind you, I still do not think I have seen blood and gore on a level where I could not handle it).Of the two, I enjoyed Planet Terror more as I felt it was better written than Death Proof. I felt Death Proof had a lot of unnecessary dialog but was a lot of fun. However, both were a lot of fun. While Planet Terror caught my attention more (Rose McGowan was a huge reason behind that), Death Proof was very enjoyable as well. Kurt Russell was hilarious in his role as Stuntman Mike. Vanessa Ferlito, Tracie Thorn, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Rosario Dawson all helped Death Proof with the way they portrayed their characters, especially in the case of Tracie Thorn and Vanessa Ferlito. In Planet Terror, John Brolin and Marley Shelton were very entertaining as the Block doctors. Rose McGowan was my favorite in this movie as despite this being a cheesy Science Fiction, she showed strength, fear, and emotion. Overall, an excellent double feature in the style of the 70s. And pay attention to the 'coming attractions' as they were also very entertaining a lot of fun.If you go into the movie and do not take it too seriously, you will have a lot of fun with this.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Hated, hated, hated it!","I was really disappointed in this movie. When I saw the previews, I thought it looked totally awesome and couldn't wait to see it, thinking it might finally redeem Tarantino in my eyes, but it didn't. I know some people who really loved it, but I think it's a movie that either you really love or really hate...it's not going to evoke any lukewarm feelings in the middle. Screw the cost of the ticket, I just felt that I had wasted 3 1/2 hours of my life that I would never get back--absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen ever. If I hadn't been on a date, I would have left the theater. As it was, I pretended I needed to visit the ladies' room just to have the opportunity to leave the theater and hang out in the lobby for a while.Violence doesn't bother me, but grossness for the sheer sake of grossness does, as do references to cannibalism. There's a reason that's called the ""last taboo""--and if a director has to resort to that to add oomph to his flick, then there's not much there to begin with. Who was it who said ""It takes a lot of time and money to look cheap and trashy""? That's how I felt about this film. They really tried to work the genre fantastically, which is what intrigued me in the first place, but what seemed to be forgotten was the fact that B-movies were corny and funny, and ""Grindhouse"" got a little close in some parts, but not nearly enough to fully earn the title or ""resurrecting the genre"". Sure, I've been told I took this movie too seriously, and that it wasn't meant to be taken like that. My response to that is that it should have been a whole lot cornier and stupid, not just gross.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Fun! Just Make Sure You Pee in Advance.,"If you can stand to sit still for three and a half hours, Grindhouse is amazing. My only complaint, along with about half the audience I watched it with, was that it needs an intermission. Some of us were already getting out of our seats when we realized we weren't going to be given a chance to refill on popcorn between films.Planet Terror is campy, gory fun, with pretty much nonstop action. The amount of gore is surprisingly high for an 'R' film, and it contains some of the most stupidly hilarious one-liners in recent movie history. Death Proof has slower pacing, but the engaging dialogue more than makes up for it. And without giving anything away, suffice it to say that Death Proof contains one of the most impressive car chase scenes I've ever seen.Grindhouse is a perfect homage to '70s exploitation flicks. Both its features are appropriately campy, and the stunning visuals paired with competent acting put this flick head-and-shoulders above any other wannabe campy-horror film since Shaun of the Dead. Definitely not a movie for everybody, but if you like classic horror exploitation flicks, you're going to have a great time watching Grindhouse.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
only 2 words properly describe Grindhouse!!!!,"Cresent Fresh!! There's not much more to describe it! The movie delivers on everything you would hope and expect. Blood, gore, violence, sex, humor. They nail the campy low budget feel of the old 70's movies. Down to missing reels, poor editing, bad film quality, the works! the movie is 3 hours long but when it's over you find yourself wanting 3 hours more! The trailers by Rob Zombie, and Eli Roth are just as entertaining as the 2 features themselves! I wanted to buy another ticket as soon as the show left out. People looking for another Pulp Fiction, or another Dusk Till Dawn from Tarantino will be let down. People wanting another Dawn of the Dead, etc will be let down. This is not big budget. It's very true to it's roots. And it's fantastic in doing so!Fantastic movie! Cresent Fresh!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Planet Yawn,"I'm going to make this brief for two reasons. Firstly, I figure people will see this so I don't want to ruin the good parts of the film. Seondly, I don't want to waste too much time on a blah sack of dung.Planet Terror- Honestly, this was the one I was expecting to like more, and was ultimately the most disappointed with. Something just doesn't work. If you're like me, you'll see the where this movie goes from ""meh"" to ""this is the dumbest thing I've seen in a long time."" Hint: caravan leaving the BBQ restaurant. Luckily this moment is late in the film, so you've got a little time to enjoy it. Still, the violence is almost so constant that it loses all of its oomph.Deathproof- I like this one more than I thought I would. I actually have grown very weary of ol' Quentin's style. All this referential dialog bull-hockey, and over-indulgent, self-masturbatory film-making is just getting trite. This film actually starts out very strong. In fact, what i viewed as the strong part would have made for a brilliant mini-film (it turns out that sitting through two straight movies is a chore.) But no, after a potentially great ending we are treated to a absolutely ludicrous amount of dialog which serves no purpose at all. If you want to make Vanishing Point, make Vanishing Point. Car chase movies are exactly that, car-chase-movies! They are not dialog driven in any way. To tell the complete truth I fell asleep during a bit of the dialog bit. It was pretty uninspired dialog. Also, Kurt Russells character somehow goes from being amazingly awesome to a whiny little turd in the blink of an eye.And yes, the fake aged film effect goes over the entire thing and is stupidly overused the entire time, especially in Planet Terror. Fake Cuts, ""Missing Reel"" screens. This was clearly made by two guys who really like to show off that they ""get"" Grindhouse films, a nice little pat on the back. They just seemed to miss what was the entire beauty of the genre.So if you are easily amused, and like to spend 3.5 hours pretending, and subsequently showing, that you ""get it,"" than this flick is for you. For those of you who actually like grindhouse films, stay away! Watch one of the old ones you count as a favorite. It's just one long inside joke between the filmmakers.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

One Hell of A Fun Ride !,"Now I am a big Tarantino fan so this will be a bit biased. I can see how some people will go see this movie and absolutely hate it. I heard several people in the theater saying ""what the hell is this."" But that only added to my enjoyment of the movies because this is the most fun I have had at the movies maybe in my life. You definitely get your money's worth here. Not only do you get the two feature films but also some hilarious fake trailers. Because I grew up on some of these movies I felt like I was watching a Saturday Night Live skit at times but I loved it. Both of these movies are so over the top, I couldn't help but burst into laughter. The car chases at the end of ""Death Proof"" are worth the price of admission along with a great performance by Kurt Russel.

Like Nothing You've Ever Seen,"I got the chance to see GRINDHOUSE last night (Sunday after its release) and I really enjoyed it. But before I get to the review, here are a few warnings you should consider before seeing this spectacle:1) The whole show (with trailers, movies, everything) is about 3 hours, 35 minutes (with no intermission). If you decide to see this, do your body a favour by NOT buying the 200 oz. cup of soda. 2) Don't come into this movie expecting something logical, smart, or intelligent. These movie are plain stupidity, but that's what makes them fun. If you think otherwise, you will be disappointed. 3) I have never seen a movie this gory and violent before (or in a really long time). If blood makes you squeamish, stay at home.Now, to the review.First the trailers start. Among the trailers for real movies that are coming out, a Grindhouse trailer is shown (there was a Grindhouse festival before, and I guess this trailer won). The movie was so intelligently named ""Hobo with a Shotgun"". It was the stupidest premise for a movie, but I laughed and it was pretty ""Grindhouse-authentic"". After the 30 million trailers (it felt like that anyways), the feature presentation starts...or does it? We now come across another trailer (a fake one) for a movie called ""Machete"". This one was also funny, and a nice start to GRINDHOUSE. Now the movies start.The first flick of the Rodriguez/Tarantino double bill is PLANET TERROR. It is basically a super-gory zombie movie with typical thrills and chills and the odd funny joke. Look for DEATH PROOF director Quentin Tarantino as ""Rapist #1"" (near the end of P.T.). I found this movie to be enjoyable, but it isn't very logical and there are a lot of ""missing reels"" in this one. And it was authentic like all typical grindhouse movies (the picture was scratched and the film sizzled from time to time). As well, the script was solid and the visuals were great, so it's definitely a fun ride.Next up are the fake trailers, which are kind of like a small intermission if you really had to go to the bathroom (few people did). The trailers were a nice touch to the show, and I really liked the trailer for ""Thanksgiving"" (it's mentally messed up, but I have to say, it was so stupid and gross it was damn funny). Other trailers included ""Don't"" and ""Werewolf Women of the SS"". And with that, the next feature begins.I was waiting for this one. I am a big Tarantino fan, and I have already read the scripts for the GRINDHOUSE features, so I had an idea of what to expect. From reading the script, I felt disappointed, but watching the movie got my faith back. Quentin Tarantino's DEATH PROOF is about a deranged killer named Stuntman Mike who finds women, stalks them, and then kills them with his car (sounds awful, but it really is fun to watch). Now this movie clearly has a lot less gore than PLANET TERROR, but it has a fantastic car chase that you can't afford to miss. Although I have to say, the car collisions in this movie are graphically epic (especially the first one, jeez!). Again, look for Tarantino to make a cameo as Warren, the bartender. Tarantino is a master of dialogue and he proves it here, but the dialogue scenes are too long and take a little bit away from the movie. But it builds up to the chase sequence and it makes it all worth while.In conclusion, GRINDHOUSE is a great show (if that's what you're into; if you're not, you're going to hate it). It's got guns, sex, drugs, and an abundance of nudity. It's violent and inappropriate in every way, and shows Tarantino and Rodriguez at the top of their game. The trailers are a nice touch, and if you're into the movies, it really doesn't feel excruciating sitting through this 3 hour 35 minute epic. If you have a taste for blood and hours upon hours to kill, GRINDHOUSE is definitely for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Everything I could have ever hoped! B movie Perfection!,"Tarantino and Rodgriguez never ceases to amaze me. The power behind the thrown is when you make great flicks you have the green light to make whatever you want. Grindhouse is another example of this.The true grit experience of the Grindhouse with shady film quality and ridiculous trailers in between make this not just a movie but a cinematic adventure! Im not going to say which movie of the two is better cause they both are bonifide b movie pleasure. I will say Rodriguez's flick is more in your face action throughout, whiles Tarantino rely's on his hip dialogue savy to carry his work of art. Don't get me wrong, when Tarantino's movie gets going, its more eruptive than a volcano on a bad day.In the performance of his career, Kurt Russel's character Stuntman Mike will be a cultish character that will be a staple in the lore of Mr. Blonde and Winston Wolf. The big surprise is Zoe Bell's performance as herself as she gets her witty kicks in alongside Rosario Dawson which make up 2/3rds of the lady heroins in this feature.Great offbeat performance's by Michael Biehm and Josh Brolin really make RR's Planet Terror click. Freddy Rodriguez and Rose Mcgowan are phenomenal in this capacity as star crossed lovers turned vigilantes's.One thing is for certain, this was the best movie exp of my LIFE. I loved every minute. GO SEE THIS MOVIE! And do NOT get up to go to the batroom and miss the fake trailer's, they are just as impressive as the features!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The directors got the last laugh,"Grindhouse failed to capture the feeling of the 60's and 79's B movies. I saw the film in a theater where it seemed to run much longer than 3 hours. Laughter in the audience was sparse. No one stayed through the credits. The most amusing parts were the fake trailers shown before and between the two films. The first film was a combination of Night of the Living Dead and Doom. The female lead has little of the sex appeal needed for her pivotal role. There was some good acting by secondary performers and there were so many of them. The second film was a car war starring an amusing Kurt Russell. Unfortunately, that was the whole plot for the 90 minutes. It seemed like the first 45 minutes were filled with really inane dialog from remarkably unappealing actresses. Fortunately, the women were replaced with four other actresses about midway (for no apparent reason). Unfortunately, their lines were just as inane as the first set. The theater should have made an announcement that it was OK to use cell phones during these scenes. Finally, the car war started. There was some remarkable stunt work there. It was also interesting (for about 5 minutes) to see how a new film could be made to look like one produced and abused in 1970. During the film, several B movies were mentioned, like Vanishing Point. Take an evening to watch Vanishing Point and the last film of Grindhouse. I think you will understand my disappointment in Grindhouse. In the 60's and 70's ""B"" movies didn't necessarily mean ""bad"" movies. I think the directors copped out on this film and are laughing at the audience.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Death Proof is Better,"I've now seen the Rodriguez/ Tarantino double-feature Grindhouse twice- a week between each viewing. That's how I always treat important movies.All right, I'll break it down for you. Grindhouse consists of two hour-long movies- Planet Terror and Death Proof, with trailers to four fake movies- Machete, Werewolf Women of the S.S., Don't, and Thanksgiving.Rodriguez's film, Planet Terror, was a bit unimpressive. Though a half-naked Rose McGowan (especially with a machine gun for a leg) is visually stimulating, the movie really had more blood and sex than actual substance. Blood and sex are great, but in order to make the blood and sex worth seeing, a little bit more quality is required. The squeamish should view this movie with caution- nobody likes to lose six-dollar popcorn.Tarantino's film, Death Proof, is the real jewel in this double-feature. It has everything one expects from a Tarantino film: drawn out conversation about sex, semantics, and obscure pop culture, lots of eyes, lots of light, and, of course, action! And the best part is, no CGI! That's right- real stunt people. This film is packed with hot chicks and car chases, but it's much more than that. Kurt Russel plays a twisted serial killer named Stuntman Mike, whose car is deathproof. However, Mike meets his match in a group of four young women who refuse to be victimized. To me, this film is about the empowerment of women, and I might almost call it a chick flick.Grindhouse was the best movie-going experience I've ever had. Go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It is everything you were wishing it would be, and more.","With action, comedy, romance, drama, suspense, mystery, satire, horror, sci-fi, political commentary, thrills, and also a plethora of nods and references to previous works and previous genres; Grindhouse is a package full of everything and anything you can think of. Not only does it contain all that (and more), but also it has easily emerged as one of the best films in a very long time. Tarantino has finally met his match as Rodriguez has perfected his skills. Overall this film is just way too much fun to miss. Granted it is not for those easily sick or easily offended, those who can take the heavy content will leave the theater with a smile on their face guaranteed. Welcome, to the Grindhousereview.The review will run in order of the films and trailers presented. The tone is set with the hilarious and action-packed ""Machete."" Featuring Danny Trejo as a tough-looking renegade, the fake trailer is full of guns, action, and fun one-liners to repeat time and time again. We make our way into the first major motion picture, ""Planet Terror."" Planet Terror is the best part of the movie without a doubt. With fast pacing, a lot of action and terror, superb acting, fantastic direction, and enough gore to please zombie fans of any kind, Planet Terror is a horror fan's dream come true. To add to that, the make-up and the special effects here are beyond startling, and definitely not like the B-movies that Rodriguez is paying homage to. Robert Rodriguez has done some great work in the past; but this is him at the peak of his game. Not only does he continue the choppy/quick-paced editing and hardcore uncut thrills, but he also brings in a hefty dose of emotion not seen in his recent pictures. Also serving as the composer, he has a nice soundtrack to top it all off with the help of his band Chingon.After the trip of ecstasy that is Planet Terror, we get a few more trailers. The second trailer is directed by Rob Zombie, which is a bit weird but has a cameo that more than makes up for it. The mastermind behind Shawn of the Dead directs the one after that, and his trailer comes off as a hilarious treat. Topping them all however is the most disturbing movie trailer in the history of cinema, but also one of the funniest and most rewarding. Eli Roth (maker of the sadistic Cabin Fever and Hostel) is behind the camera on that bizarre and sick gem. After the trailers sicken the audience we then get a very mixed bag from Quentin Tarantino with his film, Death Proof.Unlike the approachable Planet Terror, Death Proof is proof (pun intended) that Tarantino cannot craft a mindless action film, or a film with little dialogue. Even with the little running time he is allowed, he still writes a doozy of a script in his segment. In this film, we follow the lives of several women as they enter a city that is haunted by the presence of a serial killer that uses a unique tactic of killing his victims: his car. But, unlike the previous flick, the buildup is quite slow, as character development is happening slowly but surely. The pacing is pretty much a quarter of the length of Planet Terror.Some people actually left the theater in the middle of Death Proof, which shows that they have not seen a Tarantino flick. If you like his previous stuff, then you will appreciate his usual blend of action and dialogue. Otherwise, do your best to stick around, because the payoffs are fantastic. Stating the genre that he is paying homage to would actually spoil the surprise, as it becomes blatantly obvious--but only in the end. Nonetheless, we get one of the best car chases filmed this decade, and also one of the funniest yet anti-climactic endings of its kind. The true beauty of Death Proof lies in the fact that you cannot predict where the story is going, nor can you predict where, when, and how it's going to end. Patience is a virtue, and the fruits of rewards come with the final segments of Death Proof. Despite all this, Tarantino actually provides the weaker of the two movies, which comes off as a surprise considering his track record (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill Vol. 2).Grindhouse's look and style is authentic and only adds to its appeal that is already present. Besides all the raw footage with so much blood that you'll be checking your clothes from time to time, Grindhouse also has missing footage, unsynchronized audio and video, bleeding colors in the film, and a lot of dirt and dust all over the place. Don't worry; the films are still viewable, even if there are some times in which the missing footage comes at all the worst moments. The effort and time spent in this project is shown with all the little details all over the place. Finally, we have nods and references to not only films of the 60s and 70s, but movies from the directors themselves; including Desperado and Pulp Fiction. The die-hard fans will get the most out of Grindhouse, but the average moviegoer can and will get a kick out of this too.Bottom Line: Watching this movie is not a request, but a requirement. It is strong; it is violent and rough, but unbelievably entertaining. Everything about Grindhouse was spectacular, from the directing to the editing to the content to the extra goodies to the details to the acting to even the musical score. We have two of among Hollywood's best minds combining to deliver one heck of an experience that is refreshing and jaw-dropping at the same time. Both films are totally different, but almost equally ridiculously compelling. Grab some popcorn, and prepare to be dazzled.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great.... just missed Outstanding,"The opening trailer ""Machete"" sets the pace for the entire movie. You laugh, and you are disgusted at the same time. (If they do do a sequel, I hope Machete is one of them). Planet Terror is hands down the better of the two films. The zombie-flesh-infected people with guns, blood, guts,and overall disgust, with a mix of sex and humor is everything a exploitation film should have (under Hollywood's pressures and the MPAA). The middle fake trailers were good as well. My favorite being Eli Roth's Thanksgiving. There is an immediate resemblance to John Carpenter's Halloween, except on Turkey Day. Finally, Death Proof had its HIGHS and LOWS. The highs were the action. The lows was Tarantino's TWO ENDLESS RANTS. I love his dialogue but two very similar dialogue scenes that last for over 40 minutes of the movie is too much. Plus, the dialogue was not even relevant unlike his dialogue in Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction. But in the end, it takes two to be a grindhouse and it was worth the 10 dollar admission. 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Who stuffed the ballot box ?,"Did I see a different movie than everyone else?The Robert Rodrigues segment was o.k.. Hot women, Bruce Willis, gooey zombies, weird plot with strange twists....fairly good. The ""trailers"" were the best part of the experience, maybe because they were so short. Somewhat imaginative. The Tarantino segment, which I anticipated would be the most interesting part of this experience, was just awful. The only glimmer of satisfaction came from Kurt Russell's appearances, which is the only reason why I stayed 'till the end of the debacle. This whole segment runs about 85 minutes long and has around 55 of those occupied by not one, but TWO separate groups of women spewing Tarantino male oriented jive/trash talk dialog at/to one another. It was unbearable to sit through, TWICE. This segment ends abruptly and left me feeling cheated.How this movie gets as high a rating as it has is beyond my ability to understand. I've enjoyed all, to one degree or another, Tarantino movies. Maybe I have an unrealistic anticipation of what I have come to expect from him as a creator of film as art. I feel that he takes the risk of producing something different for the movie-going public to experience. Same with Rodrigues. I guess that a lot of money was spent to create a ""B"" movie feel to this flick. In my opinion, that money was wasted. As with all art, sometimes the creative risk taker scores a big hit, as T. did with ""Pulp Fiction"". Sometimes the project misses the mark. This project falls into the latter category......BIG TIME.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fantastic tribute to a vanished genre,"Before home video, the only way to see low-budget exploitation films featuring graphic violence and lots of nudity was to go to a ""grindhouse""- a fleapit movie theater usually located in an inner city neighborhood and run by management who viewed unspeakably bad taste and an ""X"" rating as badges of honor. These theaters got their nickname because they would sometimes offer burlesque performers as an added attraction. Anyway, this film is a lengthy homage both to the grindhouse experience in it's own right, and to the kind of movies that were shown there.""Grindhouse"" takes the form of a double feature: Robert Rodriguez's zombie flick ""Planet Terror"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof"". The first feature is stronger by far, with loads of OTT set pieces, grotesque special effects, bucketloads of black humor, and intentionally wretched dialogue. The purposefully incoherent plot centers on the mayhem unleashed by a group of renegade soldiers who release a chemical agent that turns people into gruesomely disfigured (and, you guessed it- flesh eating)zombies. A small group of luridly characterized 'survivors' have to figure out what is going on and then fight their way to safety. Overall Rodriguez succeeds in replicating trashy, gonzo filmaking at it's absolute best.The second feature recounts what happens to two separate groups of young women when they run into a serial killer (Kurt Russell's ""Stuntman Mike"")who uses his car as a murder weapon. The extended, climactic car chase is exhilarating but this installment is very badly paced. It feels like the first hour is nothing but a showcase for QTs admittedly otherworldly talent for constructing parlance. Yes, the interchanges between various characters are razor-sharp and compelling. Also, when the car chase explodes onto the screen it is much more thrilling due to the prolonged build-up. But in the end, there is far too much talk in this installment. Ironically, the quality of the verbal interplay also undermines the grindhouse motif since real movies of this sort had absolutely terrible scripts. Nonetheless, it's a worthwhile effort and oozes love for redneck gems such as ""White Lightning"" and ""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry"".In addition to the two main features, there are also several trailers for ersatz grindhouse fare such as ""Werewolf Women of the SS"". Two standouts here are the previews of ""Machete"" (Mexploitation at it's worst)and ""Thanksgiving"" (a Holiday slasher flick- directed by Eli Roth), both are so on-the-money that they are absolutely hilarious. Other subtle touches include the 1970s kaleidoscope pattern that fills the screen during intermissions, and ads featuring pictures of truly ghastly-looking 'Tex-Mex' food available ""next door to the theater"". Finally, the entire film has been treated so it looks like an aged and abused print is being projected onto the screen.The home video boom effectively killed off the real grindhouse theaters two decades ago, and the closest thing today to the exploitation flicks that were their lifeblood would probably be the more lurid offerings that are released directly onto DVD and late-night cable. Where ""Grindhouse"" really triumphs is in recreating a lost experience for a whole new generation of moviegoers. Not only is this movie tasteless, rollicking fun, but it is also by turns both exhilarating and hilarious. A true postmodern masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Like Being 'Grinded' By A Cinematic Stripper...,"All puns and jokes aside, 'Grindhouse' was the most fun film experience I've had since...well, 'Kill Bill'. Like many have already said, I sat through the whole thing with one huge grin on my face.The trailer for 'Machete' kicks things off with a tribute to the race oriented action exploitation film. It also contains what I though was one of the funniest moments in the whole thing...""Where are my wife and daughter!?"" I really hope this thing gets made like RR was planning, or we at least get the reported 40 minutes of footage shot as a bonus on DVD.The first film, 'Planet Terror', while seemingly a zombie film (which the 'sickos' technically aren't zombies per se), is also a meld of John Carpenter and Italian giallo. The aged and worn look applied to the film really works. I like the way RR timed it in certain places, even though some may complain about this. The film feels old school, the kind of flick you unfortunately don't see anymore. I loved 'Sin City' and while 'From Dusk Til' Dawn' and 'Desperado' were fun, I was never crazy about Rodriguez. But here he finally accomplishes what he almost did with FDTD, he makes a really GREAT B-movie.The next batch of trailers was great. 'Werewolf Women of the SS' took itself a little too seriously, but Nic Cage is a highlight. 'Don't', in the style of European horror films, was my favorite. Will Arnett did a great voice-over and the clips were dead on. I wish I hadn't seen 'Thanksgiving' before seeing it in theaters, the surprise element would have been great. Not really an Eli Roth fan, but the trailer was good.Everything I had read about Tarantino's film 'Death Proof' had elevated it above 'Planet Terror'. Well...yeah. I'm torn. I really enjoy both. 'Death Proof' is different and that is good. Having read the screenplay, it'll probably benefit from the extended cut that is going to Cannes. In terms of QTs films, 'Death Proof' would be at the bottom, but that doesn't mean it's bad. I just can help but feel that QT already poured a lot of his love for grindhouse into the far better 'exploitation' homage, 'Kill Bill'.Overall, 'Grindhouse' isn't for everyone. It's a movie for people who really love movies, all kinds of movies, good or bad, classic or camp. It is pure escapist entertainment, and a love letter to movies that time forgot.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Two films for the price of one,"This film, or event, which contains two films has what films have been missing in the pass few years or so. That is the fun factor. Too many films are too serious now a days. Grindhouse is just a lot of fun and an amazing way to kill 3 and half hours. Both films were great, although Planet Terror was a bit faster paced but Death Proof was just as good. The fake trailers in between were hilarious, my favorite parts. I highly highly recommend you get a group of your friends together and go enjoy this film without leaving for a second. Tarantino and Rodriguez are my idols and what they did with this film should be taken in by many film makers and learn to make going to the movies fun again.NEIL the KING",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A silly film/s with no story and extreme violence,"People nowadays just like nonsensical violence, it really does not make sense for our society to produce this utter trash. Especially by directors that have such a big following, it just leads to many poisoned minds that have a much harder tolerance to violence and as of such are capable of much more violence than someone less exposed to imagery of this sort.Directors with such a large following should really know better. So should publishing houses and cinemas.This film that should not be called film. This is a porn flick for weirdos who are into extreme violence. You know the sort, those that need to see a psychologist.I think less of the people that review this highly, than the directors that actually made it.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Be open minded,"A lot of people have seen previews for this movie and refuse to see it because a woman has a gun for a leg.....now to me that doesn't seem like a logical reason to condemn the movie and never watch it. BE OPENMINDED. I went into this movie knowing nothing of what it would be like...and I loved it! Planet Terrors action set up the two movie sequence nicely. It didn't start off slow it started with power. Death Proofs cleverness and humor left you laughing as the movie ended. This movie is pure fun! QT and RR did a great job entertaining the audience with a 3 hour double feature movie, Never was bored once.SO folks don't judge it if you haven't even seen it, GO SEE IT. I'm sure most of you will have a 2nd opinion coming out of the movie.This is definitely going into my favorite movie category 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Planet Terror needs a sequel,"Well I must say that after all the hype I had a hard time going into this one... I was expecting something critically loved for all the wrong reasons and for most part I'm right about this. Tons of movies like the two featured in Grindhouse are hailed by critics as total garbage and a waste of everyone's time... But when you get big names like Quentin Tarantino behind the film all of the sudden it's perfectly alright to create total schlock or a tribute to said schlock.Before I go into detail the only Tarantino or Rodriguez film I've ever really enjoyed was the last time the two collaborated on From Dusk Till Dawn.For the most part Grindhouse delivers... Actually I take that back... Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror delivers on a level that I haven't seen in theaters for a very long time yet. It's a tip of the hat at all the old 80's sci-fi horror camp and it's done very bloody well. The level of gore is unmatched by most films I've seen in the theater recently, and the movie is very quickly paced and doesn't let up. There's really never a dull moment the entire film and honestly I've almost fully restored faith in Rodriguez. He's always been able to do a hell of an action scene, but a lot of the times his movies lacked something that really made them memorable.Well now that Rodriguez has an element he doesn't need a real plot for, his talents really do shine. Just everything about Planet Terror stands out as good news in my book.The characters are all fairly memorable but not legendary or anything. Sure you'll have a larf at the wooden legged stripper Cherry Darling or the almost ultimate badass but not quite Wrey. If you're a movie buff you'll see that it's good to have Reese from Terminator back or The Lawnmower Man cooking up barbecue but none of the characters, while enjoyable and original, will make a real permanent impression.The story is goofy 80's horror/sci fi schlock. You've seen it before but it's done very well, tongue in cheek and pays tribute to the days of old when movies like this were actually taken seriously. Meaning that Planet Terror is MUST SEE in the book of TED.My only complaint about Planet Terror is that it should have been the second film in Grindhouse. The movie is so quickly paced and done... So right... That it's really hard to come to a grinding halt for Deathproof which is a very different movie.Taking a step back another generation and on delivery is Tarantino's "" Deathproof "". Paying homage to 70's Z grade films you've never seen and never will, it's a difficult film to swallow for the most part. It's 90% typical overdone Quentin Tarantino dialog and 10% car chase scene. I realize what goals Tarantino had when making Deathproof and I won't say he didn't achieve them... But for the most part the movie is a total mess. The only problem with me saying that is that no doubt this was the intention with Deathproof.I dug Kurt Russel as Stuntman Mike... But I wish he would have had some more time to shine in front of the camera. The movie mostly consists of a bunch of girls blabbing typical Tarantino with a bit of Russell thrown in here or there. The girls involved just really aren't enjoyable company but yet they all capture the feel the movie was going for. The story just seems to drag along and doesn't feature enough of the enigmatic Stuntman Mike. I know he's supposed to be mysterious and this movie is a tribute to movies that didn't have any plot or whatever but damnit ... He should have had more screen time.Honestly I think I wanted Deathproof to be something more than it was... While capturing the exact thing I think it was going for, it just didn't keep me totally entertained after enjoying Planet Terror so much. You'll just have to see it and judge for yourself... But I think it could have been a bit more than it was. Still.. Kurt Russel saying "" This car is 100% deathproof "" coolest line ever.As for the previews and such before and between the films ... They were enjoyable. I found Eli Roth's Thanksgiving trailer to be rather hilarious.I give Grindhouse 4/5 Corpses... Had Deathproof been as enjoyable as Planet Terror in my mind who knows what sort of ridiculous score I would have given this movie.Go to the theaters now. I don't think anyone is going to walk away disappointed if you know what you're in for.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

you people are retarded,"Why would you give this movie a 10? The Godfather, Citizen Kane and movies of those caliber aren't even considered 10's, so why would a movie which was intended to be a b movie in the first place, get a perfect score, when others, which are as close to perfection as a flick can possibly get, receive lower? Just because someone goes out aiming to make a piece of **** and succeeds, doesn't mean they deserve the same rating as someone who aims for greatness and actually delivers. It's funny how movie-buff retards will pick apart every masterpiece, and find any way possible to **** on it, yet at the same time mess themselves over some intentionally flawed piece of **** just because their movie-geek, pop-culture-junkie idol churned out another coke-induced stink nugget. It was meant to be ****, it should be rated as ****, otherwise we might as well put porn on here and start dropping 10's, because I feel a whole lot more fulfilled and satisfied after watching that kind of **** than I ever have from watching any movie. I don't really think this movie deserved a 1, probably a 5 or 6, but I just want to cancel out one of you morons who gave it a 10 ;)",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
a worthy homage to exploitation.,"it's really a damn shame this movie didn't stay in many theaters for too long and didn't make much money. i saw this the day it came out, two weeks later, it was out of the running at my mall.like seriously, what else could you want? zombies, fake trailers, bruce willis, kurt russell (yes, they alone can make a movie awesome), pointless dialogue, unnecessary violence, the list goes on.everybody i know didn't see it because it looked ""stupid"". more like ""amazing and emasculating"".grindhouse was just plain good. both movies equally, but death proof in my opinion was way sweeter. no other time have i had raised my fist in the air, said ""yeah!"" and clapped during the end of a movie in a theater. that alone can guarantee you that it's a good movie.three plus hours isn't that grueling at all. plus you get two movies for the price of one.to all of you who didn't see it because you are snooty and overly judgmental: screw you.for the rest of us that did, i salute you.now go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wow...just...wow,"I just got back from the theater, and I'll be brief, because the review on the front page was excellent. This movie just strait up blew me away. Both of them.

"Two Great Films, Each With Their Own Creativity!","First off, you're waiting to see this movie. The first thing to come up is the fake trailer ""Machete"", directed by Robert Rodriguez. For me, if this was a real film, I won't watch it. It looks okay. It's really nothing special about an illegal alien killing people. There are some funny moments in the trailer, along with nudity, blood, and violence. This also starts off the ""stratchy"" and ""old look"" feel of the entire film.Next, comes ""Planet Terror"", directed by Robert Rodriguez, one of the two feature length films in this one film. It's about a world getting terrorized by zombies with what you can find like extreme violence, some bloody action, and all.This film, as a zombie film, is one of the best in history. I liked it better than Dawn of the Dead (probably not the original or Shaun of the Dead, though). In this film, you would meet a Go-Go dancer, Cherry, Wray, her boyfriend(?), Dr. Dakota Block and her husband Dr. William Block, and MANY others that will be joining the splatter.There are many gross-out moments in this film. You'll find something more than what's in your ordinary zombie film and you'll find some shocking moments, too.The acting by Rose McGowan is probably the best in this film along with Freddy Rodríguez. Yes, you can also expect funny moments in the film and a sex scene.If you like zombie films, you'll love this particular well-made zombie film with a lot of gore, violence, and some sex and nudity to fit it all together. I'm giving this film a 10/10.After that film, you'll have three more fake trailers: The second fake trailer is called ""Werewolf Women of the S.S."", directed by Rob Zombie. This one, I would probably not watch if it was made into a real film, but it is funny, especially a cameo by Nicolas Cage, which was funny.The third fake trailer you'll find is the very funny ""Thanksgiving"", directed by Eli Roth who gives a cameo. I'm not an Eli Roth fan, per se, but I would watch this film. You'll find very funny dialog with a cringing scene. You can tell you'll have fun watching this entire trailer. This is the best trailer in this whole film.The fourth and last fake trailer is simply called ""Don't"", directed by Edgar Wright. Nick Frost gives a cameo appearance. This trailer is basically about almost all the clichés in a horror film like ""Don't look behind that door"" or ""Don't scream for help"", which is why it's so funny.After that intermission, you'll find yourself watching ""Death Proof"", the second of two feature length films you'll see. This film is about a man, given the name Stuntman Mike, because he's a stuntman and his name is Mike, who picks out random girls and kills them by his ""death proof"" car, as he says. But his next victims are actually fighting back! I wonder why...In this film, you'll find more talking than car chases or any action sequence. If you want to see them, you'll have to wait at the end to actually see them but first, you'll have to hear people talk for most of the film.That's not a bad thing because Quentin Tarantino is really good at writing dialog, so you'll be interested with the conversations in the film, rather than get bored. There are some scenes that are rather gory and violent but most of the film is funny.After the witty dialog between some people, you'll see the ""best car chase in movie history"", or at least the TV spot says. Let me sum this best car chase thing up: It ain't the best car chase ever. I find others like the one in ""The Island"" much more thrilling than this one. But I must say that scene was suspenseful so it probably may be ""the best car chase sequence that is real"", meaning no CGI.Here, you'll find Kurt Russell's and Tracie Thoms's performances funny and the others were just mediocre. One thing people might be disappointed in is that this film is mostly crisp clean, meaning it doesn't have as many scratches and old look as ""Planet Terror"".If you are thinking this film will be filled with intense car chase sequences, you'll be disappointed but if you know how Tarantino does his movies, you'll like this one, maybe even better than ""Planet Terror"". I'll give this movie a 9/10. I find ""Planet Terror"" much more entertaining.Overall, I'll give this movie a 9/10, which is worth the three hours and payment for the movie. You'll get more with the price of one because this is one good piece!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie is a gift,"Grindhouse is a gift from the filmmakers to an audience that is starving for good cinema... However, that audience has apparently been fattened by Wild Hogs and Meet the Robinsons. So now, we have these two really spectacular films struggling in their commercial release, because The American audience isn't ready for the product.Now, within the next few years, knock off Grindhuse films are going to crop up everywhere, and they will capitalize where this film is supposed to be ""failing"" right now. These films are literally a gift from the filmmakers... they're giving you a gift for the price of your admission.Now.. where this experience kind of falls short... 1) flip the order... because ""Death Proof"" is a foreplay film... it dangles tension in front of you and makes you wait for a pay off, really skillful and rewarding film-making. While ""Planet Terror"" is all out intercourse from start to finish.The trailers... such a great filler and an amazing aesthetic device that only makes this theatrical experience that much more fun.A lot of people are bashing ""Death Proof"", but mostly for the same reasons they loved either ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Pulp Fiction""... Dialogue, pacing and really great performances. However, after ""Planet Terror"" a movie that is repetitively kicking your genitals for more... ""Death Proof"" comes off as slow.But... both films are amazing accomplishments and a really great experience to be had at the theater.It is worth every cent of your ticket price... And, let's be honest here... do you really need to be spending money on seeing films that making the public dumber?

spontaneous applause,"Just saw it the other day and must say I left the theater electrified. It really is a shame that this is doing so badly at the box office. With all the great reviews from respected and mainstream reviewers to boot. So much artistry went into achieving the warped film look of Planet Terror, though not many seem to notice that Death Proof slowly and subtly dispenses with the conceit, with a fairly clean look by comparison. At the amazing conclusion of Death Proof the audience erupted with claps and whoops! These films are as different as the jungle and the desert. Planet Terror is wet and gooey, jam packed, to the gills, sensory overload that must be hacked thru like a rain forest or jungle. Followed by Death Proof, a dry and dusty, talky, wide open film.

"Grindhouse: half enjoyable, half lame","I'm a fan of Tarantino but not much of one of Rodriguez and it came to my surprise when I found Planet Terror to be much more entertaining than the bloated Death Proof. If I didn't know any better, I would say Tarantino has never seen a 70s grindhouse film. His half was filled with bad dialogue that sounded like it was left on the cutting room floor of his other films and the characters were uninspired and cringe-inducing. I actually wanted all of them to die and was rooting for Kurt Russell's Stuntman Mike. Planet Terror, on the other hand, was great fun and while it still wasn't exactly a ""grindhouse"" movie (I don't remember any zombie movie from the 70s OR 80s being that well made) it worked as a stand-alone gore flick. Even the fake trailers were amusing, including Eli Roth's Thanksgiving and my personal favorite, Rob Zombie's Werewolf Women of the SS.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

More Than Just Blood and Gore: A Feat in Juxtaposition.,"The names of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are often thrown around like they're the same person. Despite the fact that they have collaborated more than once before this film, the discerning film-goer can tell the difference between the two. ""Grindhouse"" only solidifies the distinct strengths and weaknesses of both directors. Thankfully, most of the weaknesses will only be analyzed by those who know nothing about film-making or a good time.You know you're in for something different when you see an old reel that misspells the word ""previews"" (pretty badly: ""prevues""). Then you see that Hispanic gentleman whom you probably don't know the name of (don't look it up now; it's more fun if you never know his name). You're watching the trailer for ""Machete,"" a racially-charged action preview complete with a religious man wielding firearms.Of course, shortly thereafter you see the title screen: the word ""Grindhouse"" trails off the screen with a mighty close-up, almost suffocating the viewer.Then ""Planet Terror"" starts. And there's nothing terrible about its opening scene in which Rose McGowan dances like she would pleasure you and your dad if you would only let her. The rest of the film takes the more violent approach, presenting some of the most disgusting and unneeded gore in recent memory. Of course, the effect is usually comical. But the action's nothing to laugh at. Rodriguez rivals the best work of John Woo frequently with ""Terror."" The dialogue and acting are both ridiculous and likable. I'm just glad Michael Biehn is back for no good reason (which is the best reason in this case).Next, the trio of mock trailers ensue. Rob Zombie's trailer suffers more than the rest, focusing too much on the Nazis and not enough on the female werewolves--how's that for a weird complaint? ""Don't,"" directed with tongue-through-the-cheek by Edgar Wright, is playful and a welcome oddity in that it uses more wit than gore. Yet the prize for best mock trailer should go to Eli Roth for his utterly reprehensible and darkly funny ""Thanksgiving."" To say more would spoil the turkey.Finally, ""Death Proof"" wheels in to give the audience something it didn't expect. First, a few critics on this site and others have suggested that Tarantino's film is boring, pointless, and pretentious. To entertain the argument, let's assume the dialogue and acting really are substandard throughout Tarantino's film. It wouldn't matter. The direction is technically and aesthetically superb. The viewer not only sees the inner workings of a jukebox as the songs change in a bar scene; he/she also witnesses a car crash that replays from multiple angles. Some might say that is pretentious, while in actuality it is there to show how each individual in the car met her demise--ironically excessive to illustrate a point. Another example of brilliance is the extraordinarily long take of four characters talking at a table. The effect brings a realistic element to the scene, while reinforcing the point that Stuntman Mike is watching the women as they speak.Kurt Russell brings a lot of vibrance to ""Death Proof,"" bearing a strong screen presence reminiscent of David Carradine in ""Kill Bill Vol. 2."" His role is not stagnant but ever-changing. Throw in some unbelievable stunts by Zoe Bell during the final car chase, and you have a certified action classic.And by the way, the dialogue of ""Death Proof"" serves as a way to halt the action and set up the viewer for the kill, as Tarantino's dialogue has always behaved. It is not like Kevin Smith's dialogue in any way, as some have implied. To say otherwise is lunacy and a failure to recognize how Tarantino has worked since the beginning. Overall, most critics of this film seem like they wanted ""Death Proof"" to be predictable and the same as Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror.""To conclude, ""Grindhouse,"" more than anything, is a showcase for the distinct film-making styles of Rodriguez and Tarantino. I have heard about the plans for this film to be released in separate parts outside of the United States. That is a shame. ""Grindhouse"" works better as a whole. It's like if Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allen Poe had created complementary yet contrasting short stories. The greatness of certain artists is often better realized when the works of each are side-by-side.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The most fun I've had in the movies since 1965!,"I have to say that even after reading whatever I could find I still didn't know exactly what to expect but Grindhouse turned out to be the most fun I've had in the movies since way back in 1965 when I used to sit all the way down front with Patty Brown. :) (Sorry Mr. and Mrs. Brown) This is nostalgia brought up to date perfectly, and expertly executed. Grindhouse is a must see for all ""B"" movie matinée loving baby boomers (as well as our generation whatever offspring). Excellent job by all, producers, directors, cast, and crew! I loved every minute, and it's a double feature to boot! No spoilers here, I think everyone knows that both Planet Terror and Death Proof have their share of gore, but the gore is so well done, so realistic, so dark and graphic, with such an impeccably woven B movie aura, it becomes bizarrely hilarious! At the 12:30 PM opening matinée showing people were actually laughing out loud at some of the carnage! And the trailers! The missing reels! Grindhouse manages to not take itself too seriously yet project an edgy, mordant quality that is so well done it's almost too good to be true. The audience gets the feeling they're being let in on a running private joke the cast and crew are sharing. Highly recommended! Go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

What is great about Grindhouse is I have to admit Robert Rodriguez totally out did Quentin Terintino. All that aside, both features were great. The coming attractions were genius. Machete was freaking classic. I can't say enough good things about this double feature. You'll be satisfied way before Death Proof comes on, trust me. TRUST ME.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Damn fine effort,"This movie is explosive in all of the possible definitions. The critics I've read so far are mixed, and I think they just don't see the potential. So many films these days look for the ""scare"" or ""gore"" factor, ad they ALU l get stuffed together and seem like the same genre. There are two parts to this film ""Planet Terror"" and ""Death Proof"" and one is by Rodrigeuz and one is by Tarantino. ""Planet Terror"" is so over the top that you stop caring all together. It's blood ratio is par none, and it's violence is giddy and camp. The film is a great warm up for what is to come. There are great moments in ""Planet Terror"" but the real film starts with ""Death Proof"". This is not to ignore the trailers in between. They are hell incarnate, and if you have even mature kids, I would avoid the movie. But Death Proof is a mix of pure Tarantino {dialogue and wit) mixed with Steve McQueen action and throw backs to the best of car chases. Death Proof never gives up and never sticks with trends or architypes; better yet it plays upon them. Grindhouse as a whole is a technique and effort masterpiece, but it is Death Proof that stands above all and makes you wish that more movies didn't take themselves so seriously. Good fun, and art to it's outermost boundaries.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

In between both movies there comes fake trailers along with a food advertisement. The whole thing just drags you into an old state of mind, the music, the ads, the look of the film, it is amazing. Death Proof, being my favorite of the two, is not for everyone. If you love Tarantino's style, you will love it all the way, but for those not familiar with him, they most likely will complain of the lengthy amounts of seemingly pointless dialouge (though all of it has a purpose). Nevertheless once the slow start is over, high octane car action takes over that will get everyone's blood pumping, including an amazing finale that will have everyone leaving the movie with a euphoric high. If you are squeamish do not see this movie, even I couldn't help but be mildly disturbed at the trailer dubbed ""Thanksgiving"" by Eli Roth, but it's all part of the fun! Do not hesitate to delve into this amazing homage of the B-Movie at the Grindhouse! It will blow you away!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Never laughed so hard at a movie in my life,"I laughed so hard that at times no sound could come out and only dogs could hear me. I laughed so hard that I thought a two-month-old surgical scar on my neck would bust open. This guy behind me was laughing so hysterically that between the two of us we could hardly hear the next thing they were saying on the screen, and as soon as we took a breath we heard the next thing and screamed with more laughter.I highly recommend watching this movie (as I did) in a really nasty old movie theater in a small college town with a bunch of rowdy college boys in the audience. I was one of about 4 women. The boys had more fun than I've ever seen anybody have in a theater. So did I!!!My throat is still sore. There is no way you could call this movie meaningful...but any movie that can make you laugh that hard is just a pure-T pleasure and one of life's true joys. It rocked hard.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez bring back the 1970's,"The Grindhouse has everything, even phony trailers. Both directors bring back the movies of yesterday, those movies were so bad, they were good in the 70's. Robert Rodriguguez tale named Planet Terror is a mixture of films like Invasion Of The Body Snacters and Night Of The Living Dead, and it also has a little of director John Carpenter style of movie making. Rose McGowan was great as Cherry Darling, so was Marley Shelton(Bubble Boy, Valentine) as Dakota. Josh Brolin must have channeling Nick Nolte while playing this role as a doctor, but he was good none the less. And it is very violent like a 70's movie is.Then there is Quentin Taratinos tale named Death Proof, a film that makes us remember those suspenseful car chase thrillers such as Duel(1971) and Mad Max(1979), Kurt Russell is great as stuntman Mike, who drives a death proof car, and gets his thrills running people off the road. Quentin Taratino has been know to dish out incredible dialog, and create amusing characters. He never seems to out do due himself, and neither does Robert Rodriguez. These films have action, humor, and violence. But these two directors delivered it quite well. I hope for a Grindhouse 2 in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another Flaccid Failure From Wannabe Tarantino,"It's always a pleasure to log on and check out all of the Tarantino sackswingers who try to justify the drek he doles out in every film he's involved with. To think that there are actually people sitting around discussing this as if it were a real film is the most entertaining part of the entire experience.Just more self indulgent crapola spooned out for the still wet behind the ears crowd who don't have a life, couldn't get a date and are probably misunderstood by all those around them.

Hilarious bloody fun.,"Grindhouse is shown as a double feature with 2 full length films and fake trailers before and in between.Planet Terror: starring: Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez, Mary Shelton, Michael Biehn, Josh Brolin, Bruce Willis, Tom Savini, Naveen Andrews, Quentin Tarantino, Michael Parks, Stacey Ferguson, Jeff Fahey.Robert Rodriguez directs and writes this hilarious zombie movie. Planet Terror is about a stripper Cherry (McGowan), an outlaw type guy named El Rey, and a gang of people trying to stop these government created mutants. This movie was absolutely hilarious. Rodriguez made sure it was as bloody and purposely dumb as possible. It was filled with purposeful mistakes and scratched film, along with one of the funniest scenes in the film due to a missing reel. The special effects were great and hilarious, as was the over the top acting. ""Planet Terror"" was a bit silly, but brilliant over the top parody. My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 86 mins.Death Proof: starring: Kurt Russell, Vanessa Ferlito, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rose McGowan, Quentin Tarantino, Michael Parks, James Parks.Quentin Tarantino directs the second feature length film which focuses more on characters than on extreme violence. This movie has a very odd setup that really had me confused until the very end which made the entire thing worthwhile. We start with four girls at a bar and Stuntman Mike (Russell) trying to woo them. The first 40 minutes are the setup for the last half, explaining what Stuntman Mike does to kill women. The second part is about some girls messing around by playing a game where one woman lays on the hood of the car holding on by belts until she can't hold on any longer. When Mike messes with them, he quickly learns his lesson. Where the dialogue between the women can get tedious and over-stretched at times, Kurt Russell gives such a screen presence and great performance that he makes up for it. The last 20 minutes don't let up with the excellently filmed chase scenes. By the end, you realize that this is Tarantino's homage to the women kicking butt movies from the 60s and 70s. Great character development and superb chase scenes make this a great movie, and a great way to end the double feature. My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 87 mins.The fake trailers were another part of the movie, and a part that had me hysterically laughing. Before the movie starts we see a trailer for ""Machette"" starring Danny Trejo as a Mexican action star and Cheech Marin as a tough priest. The trailers in the middle of the movie are the great ""Werewolf Women of the SS"", the true story of Hitler's army of werewolves. ""Thanksgiving"", a horror movie about a killer who decapitates people quite well, and ""Don't"", a cheesy looking horror movie about a haunted house. All the fake trailers were hilarious and filmed perfectly to look like the original terrible movies they're based on. Directors Rob Zombie, Eli Roth and Edgar Wright lend their directing talent to these.Overall this was a laugh out loud funny, exhilarating experience that any fan of Rodriguez, Tarantino, or any fan of great parody and action should not miss.Final rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 191 mins. Rated R for strong violence, sex, nudity and drug use.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Cheesy, yet a fun-house as well!","Exploitation films are a real big deal in the 1970's. When you combine the genius work of Freddy Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, you got a big hit on your hands! In ""Grindhouse"" two movies are shown for this big title. First you see ""Planet Terror"" by Rodriguez, there's a strange biochemical that makes zombies, a go-go dancer(Rose McGowan) loses her leg to a those monsters, a mysterious loner(Rodriguez) who fights the zombies and gives Cherry, a machine gun on her stump. There's plenty of action, plenty of humor, and plenty of sexual interaction which gets edited. However, it was very fun to watch. Cherry really puts the ""A"" in action when she launched herself into action against the zombies. And the dance skills she's done has paid off. It was more funny when she replaces the smaller gun for the Gatlin gun. Wray would have been more proud. In ""Death Proof"", the main weapon is a 1970 Chevy Nova driven by Stuntman Mike(Kurt Russell). This man is so bad, I wouldn't ride with him. This one has much more action, and will leave you on the edge of your seat, literally. Both movies were great, and those coming attractions were hilarious, despite they were phony. Other than that I enjoyed them. Forget the popcorn, enjoy nachos with this movie! HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!! 4 OUT OF 5 STARS!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Once again, they have done it!","Once again, Quentin and Robert have innovated the way we watch films. This movie has it all! Hilarious comedy, Enough blood and violence to go around, sex, a little bit of nudity... but not too much, only when necessary, action to blow your eyes out, and well written dialog. This movie was excellent, I'm a big fan of both directors work, Loved Sin City, Loved Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and went in with the idea of these movies being combined together.... wasn't what this was... but that added to my experience! People say u gotta know wut ur walking into but i disagree, that actually might add to the experience, my advice is stop reading about the movie and watch it, its a theater experience to treasure and a great look into another part of Robert and Quentin's creativity. 9/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing!,"Easily the best 'movie' I have seen for a few years! I won't go into plot details as there are many folks on IMDb who have already done so. I just returned from this piece of brilliance after a date with my loving wife. We both absolutely adored the film. I am partial to zombie movies, so Planet Terror was a wonderful experience for me, and my lovely lady just loves the 'chicks getting revenge' genre, so for her Death Proof was a total kick in the ass (in a good way!). I laughed so hard during this film at so many normally inappropriately moments, but it was totally cool with this film. After over 2.5 hours, I was ready for more and was so disappointed when the lights came on. I can not wait for the DVD to come out and hope they have commentary tracks by QT and RR as well as by actors in the films.Hell, just give me a DVD of Rose McGowan. She has certainly matured as an ... er ... as an actress. I'd never have to leave the house (except for more paper towels and hand lotion, of course!) See it! Often!

You people are stupid... I don't get it...,"OK, this isn't going to be just one of those, quick, insulting rants of a review... But most of the people reviewing this movie are just silly, and it shows.First off, if you had seen either of these movies on their own and under the guise of being normal movie fair... Not from Rodriguez and Tarantino... You would have called them both a piece of crap and not worth your time... The 8.6 Grindhouse has on IMDb is utterly ridiculous... And ol' QT would point at you and laugh if he saw it... It's one thing to pay money for it and go and see it to make fun of it or try and understand what it's doing... But another thing to call it a great film...That having been said... The only good moments in the film are Nicolas Cage's bit... (Which was really, genuinely funny...) and the part where Kurt Russell impersonated John Wayne...By the way, Russell did a really good job... And now will probably be offered some genuinely good roles in the following years because of it... (You wait and see)... Just like what happened to Willis and Jackson because of Pulp Fiction... I think Tarantino knows this too... And looks for the actors he sees potential in... And could further their career... Props to Russell, really... Even tho this movie is a piece of crap, he had the presence of mind to realize it would be a huge asset to himself to play in this film...If this film is legit... It isn't as a film... It's legit in perhaps helping us understand Tarantino's purpose in his art... I would dare say, this film is really the epitome of QT's film philosophy... Quintin, like his favourite director Sergio Leone, takes the stereotypes and the archetypes from different genres and combines them... And amplifies them... Without regard to depth of content... As if to say... ""Look, this is what cinema really is... Right here... And this enough to keep you coming back..."" And the truth is, he's right... And it is enough... But that doesn't mean we should then call it good... An accurate social commentary on the entertainment driven society of America? Yes... Good movie? NO... All his works have been in the end, content-less... With no depth... All tantalization...Tarantino is a brilliant man for understanding and exploiting this... And in that way, I might appreciate him as a philosopher... One day, I actually look forward to reading a book he would hopefully write about himself...But I don't like meaningless, content-less movies... And I have yet to watch a Tarantino flick that I felt like it wasn't...I give 3 points because Kurt Russell was genuinely interesting to watch and Nicolas Cage made me laugh my ass off...",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Incredible Senselessness,"When I walked into the theater for ""Grindhouse"", I had been ready previews on it for months. I knew what I was going into see. That said, this film was incredible. It opens with an incredibly hilarious fake preview, and then leads right into Robert Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror,"" which, I believe, captured the mood of Grindhouses perfectly. From the outrageous violence to the ""imperfections"" of the reel, it was simply an amazing experience. It then switches gears with more hilarious fake previews directed by Edgar Wright, Rob Zombie, and Eli Roth. Then Tarantino's movie begins which is where the movie got a little off track, I think. Don't get me wrong, ""Death Proof"" itself was an incredibly good movie, and i would pay the 7 dollars just to see that, but I think it failed to capture the Grindhouse mentality that Rodriguez's did so well. Still, the movie was incredible, and the car chase was utterly amazing, probably the best I've ever seen. All in all, this is an incredible movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Rodriguez and Tarrantino. I can't wait for the DVD release!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not a Movie: an Experience,"The movie Grindhouse is a great homage to the Grindhouse movies of the 70's. First is Planet Terror. This is by far the best zombie movie I have ever seen. The actors are great and so is the directing. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and is entertaining from start to finish. The next feature is Death Proof. I liked this movie, but Tarantino has done much better work. The movie has its very entertaining parts, but unfortunately some parts lag a bit. However, all in all its a good movie worth seeing. Let's not forget the fake trailers in between and before the features. All were entertaining, but Machete and Thanksgiving were by far the best and got the best crowd reactions. Unfortunately, Thanksgiving is available to watch on the net so I was little let down that I had already seen the best. However, all are worth staying for during the intermission. If you have to use the restroom I suggest hold it, because you don't wanna miss anything that is a part of Grindhouse. This movie is an experience that can fill an entire night. It is a movie experience like you have never felt. I highly suggest this movie. Two great movies. One ticket price. What's not to like?",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Get more than your moneys worth at the movies,"This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. As a big fan and R & T there was the brilliant dialog and bizarre and original characters we come to love with past movies. Except this time there was double for the money. Not only were the two films excellent but the fake trailers between them only sweetened the deal.Not only were the films great but the way that they were presented, with the look of the worn film, missing reels and the corny ""theater"" add ins that actually made it look and feel like a Grindhouse from the 70's.So if you enjoy zombie movies or any of Tarantino's past films, you will absolutely love the Grindhouse double feature. I just got home from the theater and I'm ready to see it again!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent double feature well worth the ticket cost.,"Before hand I want to point out that I am a fan of both Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, and being that I usually know what to expect at both directors movies so I loved this film(both films).In Rodriguez's ""Plannet Terror"" the story basically follows a group of unlikely hero's who fight off a horde of the chemical-filled-zombie-things-that-were-caused-by-the-government. ""Plannet Terror"" basically is your parody of old corny 70's/80's zombie/action flicks with corny dialog in all. I think all of the actors did pretty well, some of there dialog was corny buy I think(hope) it was apart of the whole parody thing. Hats off to Rose McGowan, who plays the GoGoDancer Cherry, that loses her leg and later gets a machine gun on it, epically does great in this flick; I never really thought much of her as an actress before this, so yay for her.The content in this movie certainly isn't for all ages, you got your helping to: over the top violence and gore, language, and sex(peg leg sex....). So if your a fan of gory thrashers you'd be at home with ""Plannet Terror"", but if your not a fan of limbs falling off don't back away from this movie yet; the violence is so over the top you probably wont mind(kinda like Kill Bill v.1). And the sex scene(peg leg sex......) doesn't get to showy for it is interrupted by a missing reel (this missing reel is used in both flicks in Grindhouse), and there is an almost rape scene in the movie that is so sickly disgusting; and who other to be the rapist then Quentin Tarantino who also has a cameo in his own part of Grind House ""Death Proof"".All in all ""Plannet Terror"" was a great movie. It has good acting and I was shocked to see Bruce Willis in it so that was cool. Great first half of Grind House does ""Death Proof"" stand to ""Plannet Terror""?""Death Proof"" Tarantino's installment in Grind House. ""Death Proof"" follows two groups of women and sadistic/smooth/crazy/crybaby character StuntManMike, impressing played by Kurt Russell.I loved ""Death Proof"" but like I said I am a fan of Tarantino's work. Let me say, chances are if you like Tarantino then you will like ""Death Proof"" if not then *maybe* you wont. Maybe because it is a different kind Tarantino movie, but if you don't like the stand out dialog he puts in his movies then...... well.... just know ""Death Proof"" has a lot of that kind of dialog. I find the pop-culture/witty dialog funny and memorable so for me, like all the other Tarantino flicks, I had no problem with it at all.This film is shot in a great way, and the car crash scene was so gory and repulsive it left me wanting more. Hands down best crash scene in ANY movie. Its awesome.The acting in this movie is pretty good for everyone. Let me throw my hat off to Kurt Russell and Rosario Dawson because their acting made the part. Kurt Russell because he shows he can *still* act that cool action guy like he used to in EscapeFromNewYork. And to Rosario Dawson, not because her acting really stood out from the other women, but because it thrills me that she gets to be in movies like these. She's been in more ""nerdy"" films lately and its been working out for both her acting job and her fan boost. You go to a comic book convention before she was in Sin City and you'd probably see no one knew who she was (although she was good in 25th hour). So its cool to see a young talented actress play in these movie(examples: Clerks II, Sin City, Devil's Rejects, Descent).Also Tarantino makes a cameo in this movie as a bar owner, and it was cool to see him, but it was no way as memorable as his little role in Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs or even his little part in ""Plannet Terror"", but still its cool to see him getting so involved in his movies.Content ways this movie was really only violent in one part(granted that part is pretty gory), but has almost more swearing then Pulp Fiction. So if you are sensitive to cursing in movies ""Death Proof"" (and ""Plannet Terror"" really) are not for you.""Death Proof"" was a great second half of Grind House even though some would say it had a slow start it is just as good as ""Plannet Terror"", but just know both movies are completely different, COMPLETELY different movies with close to nothing in common. Both good movies making Grind House a great experienceGrind House also has some funny fake movie trailers before the two main movies. All of them are funny. Eli Roth did one and Rob Zombie did too. In my opinion none of the trailers matched Rodriguez's ""Machete"" trailer that is laugh out loud funny.Grind House is a great movie that will leave you talking about it and quoting one liners from it years to come....",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worth the Money!,"I can honestly say that Grindhouse is THE most fun I've EVER had watching a movie/s. Both of the films were absolutely amazing! it started out with Rober Rodriguez's Planet Terror which is an exceptional zombie movie (and trust me, i know my zombie movies)! With a large amount of blood, gore, and gross-out type humor, I honestly didn't want Planet Terror to end... But then came Death Proof... The only problem i had with Death Proof is that Tarantino did the thing he does in all of his movies. Mindless chit-chat. He seemed so in love with his words that meant nothing to movie it was almost sickening but towards the end, he MORE than makes up for it with THE MOST intense car chase scenes I'VE EVER SEEN! The music in both of the films were amazing too! You'll be humming the theme to Death Proof for hours and Rober Rodriguez really wrote the score for Planet Terror which was great too! The trailers were a real hoot in between the movies too including one from Rob Zombie and Eli Roth. Overall. You'll love it! You'll feel very satisfied that you've bought a movie ticket to one of the most thrilling movie events in a long, LONG time!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Guilty Pleasure or Work Art? Either way its effing brilliant.,"As a huge fan of both directors, I had very lofty expectations going into""Grindhouse"" and the film more than lived up to them. I had such high hopes for this movie that I fully expected to leave disappointed, particularly since I'm not a huge fan of slasher, blaxploitation, or other low-budget ""genre"" films that were big in the 70's. The good news with this movie is that you don't have to be, anymore than you needed to be an expert in kung-fu flicks or spaghetti westerns to enjoy ""Kill Bill."" Tarantino has once again created a masterwork that is an homage to its obscure predecessors, while at the same time standing alone as a unique and highly enjoyable work. In addition, his counterpart Robert Rodriguez, has made, with the ""Planet Terror"" segment, probably his best film to date (obviously it lacks the cultural importance and guerilla aesthetic of the director's legendary ""El Mariachi"" trilogy, but Rodriguez proved that he is just as impressive with a huge budget and big-name stars as he is with a few grand and a cast of unknown Mexicans). Many of the most entertaining parts of the three-hour plus film are based on surprises/ shock-value, so to give away too much would be a disservice. Suffice to say, ""Planet Terror"" is an engrossing and hilarious zombie movie that pays tribute to all the conventions of the genre, while at the same time accomplishing something wholly original. ""Death Proof"" on the other hand, the vastly superior of the two segments (sorry, Rob-Rod), is basically a chatty chick-flick with killer car chases. Tarantino fans will recognize all of the filmmaker's trademarks (witty, rapid-fire dialogue, pop-culture references a-plenty, and an obvious foot fetish) that work brilliantly together in a way that they haven't since ""Pulp Fiction."" This film is the work of two of our ballsiest directors working at the top of their game to achieve a shared vision. The result is a guilty pleasure and a work of art, the most original and unabashedly entertaining American film of the year. Even if you have no interest in the ultra-violent films that are being paid tribute here, I urge you to see ""Grindhouse"" now, while it is still in theaters. Many of the tricks the filmmakers play such as the ""missing reels"" during important scenes and the hilarious fake trailers before and between the two features (director Eli Roth's hysterical ""Thanksgiving"" preview is an inspired stand-out) work best in a big-screen setting. Plus, you get the added bonus of watching mis-informed rubes walk out after the first segment muttering, ""that was short."" If only they knew what they were missing out on.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hits like a Spiked Hammer to the Joy Bone,"Grindhouse reviewed by Samuel OsbornTo see Grindhouse is to agree to a day spent at the movies. Me and my two movie-going compadres returned from the 192 minute double-feature and decided promptly upon three-hour naps. Between the film and the effect it has on your body, seeing Grindhouse is a full day excursion. So now I'm wiping the sleep from my eyes, hunched over the laptop keyboard racking my brain for adjectives to explain this whackjob picture. For now let's just keep things simple and say Grindhouse is, if nothing else, a damn fine way to spend a day.It's only sensible to discuss the pictures separately since each is a standalone, full-length feature of a different ilk. To those who've somehow avoided The Weinstein Company's marketing blitz to promote this thing, Grindhouse is double-feature throwback to the seventies theatres of the same name. A person would buy one ticket and see two cheap, gory, exploitative romps in a row, divided only by a round of commercials and previews for coming attractions. And so indie-film legends Robert Rodriguez (The El Mariachi series, Sin City) and Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill) have teamed up to each make their own version of a typical entry into the grindhouse circuit, complete with missing reels, overlapping dialogue, phony commercials, and fake previews authored by directors Rob Zombie (The Devil's Rejects), Eli Roth (Hostel), and Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead).Rodriguez's zombie picture, Planet Terror, hugs to the grindhouse tradition tighter than Tarantino's entry. It runs on a standard zombie storyline and works like a Land of the Dead that has enough humor to not take itself seriously. Bruce Willis has a cameo as the surprise villain, cast for the sole reason of looking irrationally badass, with other main players being Freddy Rodriguez as the frowning, muscular hero and Rose McGowan who most will recognize from the film's ads as ""the chick with an effing gun for a leg."" The film plays as well as any Rodriguez picture, but could stand to have a sizeable chunk removed. Mr. Rodriguez seems attuned, like Tim Burton and The Coen Brothers, to making films that are goodbut only good. Not sharpened up enough to write something truly great, Rodriguez tends to put out solid pictures that leave something to be desired. In a different situation this would hardly go noticed, but up against Tarantino's Death Proof, Planet Terror is plainly inferior.Of course, Tarantino doesn't exactly play by the rules. Though Death Proof occasionally remembers its grindhouse intentions, throwing in a stray missing reel and poorly edited bit here and there, Tarantino gets wrapped up in all his glowing indulgences at every turn. Part slasher film, part fictionalized episode of ""Jackass,"" and part road-rage fantasy, Death Proof is a happily uneven mess of giddy amusement. It's brilliant, but impossibly so. By its end, any semblance of a story has dissolved into an empty husk of fun; like taking a straight-shot of entertainment.There was a story to begin with, involving Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) stalking women to destroy beneath his ""death proof"" carwhich replaces the knife as the Slasher film's weapon of choice. But after being on the backend of several rounds of Tarantino's absurd talent for writing dialogue, it's time to switch gears into car chase mode. The much-hyped chase--which Tarantino has reported hoping to be in the top three car-chases of all timesheds all progression of its previous story to make way for another straight-shot of adrenaline to the face. But again, maybe Tarantino's cheating. Without giving away the twist, there's an added element to the segment that makes the chase not only fast, but also tense enough to make your palms bleed sweat. And when this extended scene ends in all its brutal majesty, Death Proof is over.To be honest, grindhouse theatres came and went before my time. But what Tarantino and Rodriguez have assembled, in all its previews, features, and commercials, is a strange device for extreme pleasure. The films shouldn't logically work, especially Tarantino's, but they do, and furiously so. It hits like a spiked hammer to the joy bone and leaves you on a high. And like any true experience at the movies, that high doesn't fade for the rest of the day.Samuel Osborn",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Simulcra - The Bad Old Good Old Days,"Of COURSE these two guys would be 1/the first guys to actually tackle the now historical premise of the double-feature 2/bring it indoors from the outside-Akron drive-in movie where it WOULD have played if drive-ins were not out-numbered by drive-thrus; 3/to mix it up across the board not only racially but by giving us NEW vixens that even Russ Meyer would yield to. That the technical artistry utilized to make it look bad/authentic IS artistry. And while comparisons between the two features is unavoidable, Rodriguez's pastiche was absolutely as wonderfully ridiculous as Tarrantino's; ""Planet Terror"" is homage to what we saw; Quentin's film is where this all is GOING. Everybody has a great time - the audience, the cast (Kurt Russell is remarkable, and kudos to ALL the fine ladies who partook), and all of you who take the considerable time to go on the ride.

It's FUN,"If you go into the movie expecting anything serious (Especially along the lines of Pulp Fiction / Kill Bill) you'll be sadly disappointed.

(The same kind of vibe I get from Kevin Smith's work for the most part, aside from Chasing Amy/Dogma none of his work is really all that classy, however it's quite good).Also, see it in theaters. I don't think this will work as well on DVD, the audience effect along with some editing techniques they used make this a much more live audience theater-favorable movie.

These guys got the devil in themGrindhouse,"Overall the film was technically perfect. Each segment was aged in post-production to make it look as though the film was thrown around and lost for the past thirty years, slowly decomposing in unsafe archiving conditions. The scratches and the film speed errors are a work of art in themselves as they never get distracting or go overboard, but instead look like normal decay for a no-budget, B-movie of this sort. Each had its moments, but I will give the edge to Rodriguez on effectiveness and seamless integration. While Tarantino succeeded with his moments of hitches/rewinded replayed seconds, his use of the ""missing reel"" ended up feeling like a gimmick rather than a reality. It was just a way for him to not show us a moment that had been building up for a while with the scene previous ending smoothly and the scene after starting right up. Rodriguez, on-the-other-hand, played it cool by burning the filmstock right before the moment of lost material. Rather than the reel being missing, it made it seem destroyed; the cut from the card to a burning building brings laughter at missing a key plot point instead of disappointment from being unable to watch what could have been a crucial motivating factor for what the killer does next in Tarantino's half.As for the films themselves, we are treated to two distinct genres, the zombie/horror and the slasher/thriller. Rodriguez's Planet Terror truly brought back the spirit and look of an old camp-infused shocker. We have a government-involved release of a toxin, which kills and then brings back to life those exposed, making them hunger live flesh. We have the hard- edged sheriff (played to perfection by the underused Michael Biehn), the token victims (Nicky Katt is hilarious as the hospital's first exposure to the epidemic), the supporting players (a nice intercut storyline with the gorgeous Marley Shelton and her husband Josh Brolin who really got the mood of his character and hit it out of the parkloved the thermometer), and our protagonists doing whatever it takes in the name of love to survive (a rediscovered Rose McGowanwho is great both here and in Tarantino's part, showing some real emotion in the midst of absurd character evolutionand probably the best acting in the whole piece from Freddy Rodriguez). We get blood and goo, face-melting, limb-chopping, flesh-eating, blood filled balloon people splattering against windshields and survivors as they are mowed down, and a genital obsessed Naveen Andrews with the best comic relief of the night. There is gore, there is sex, and there are scares mixed with laugh-out-loud craziness. Robert Rodriguez knew what he was doing and he upped the ante wherever he could, making Planet Terror a flawless piece of cinema trash.As for Tarantino's Death Proof, I was ready to be amazed. The credit sequence was fabulous as the titles overlaid static motion shots, looking out the windshield of a car, a woman's feet on the dashboard. This was looking to be pure 70's and I couldn't wait to get going. We are introduced to a trio of women out cruising the bar scene, talking about sex and love and whatever else, naturally and realistically, when we get the foreboding glimpse of the deathproof car, complete with skull and crossbones. The tension rises when the killer is finally introduced and the dialogue is sharp, witty, and twisted in just the right way. Credit Tarantino for giving us one of the best driving sequences ever as the car holding the girls (playing air-drums to a classic rock diamond in the rough) rapidly moves into a confrontation with the killer's vehicular weapon. My adrenaline was up, carnage was fresh on the screen, and it was time for act two to bring the level up even more. Unfortunately this is where Death Proof falls apart. All the build up we just experienced ends up resetting as we go through the motions again: a new group of women driving and talking, eventually to meet up with our killer. This sequence might have been better than the first, except it never got the chance because all I could think was ""didn't I just sit through this a moment ago?"" Granted, the final car chase is amazing, two cars playing out the roles of killer and victim running from each other, and losing each other along the way, like any of the best slasher films, however, I was bored to tears by the monotonous set-up, having to sit through another set of women being introduced. How can it be effective if after finally seeing some action from an amazing Russell performance, we don't get to see him for the next thirty minutes? All the suspense is gone by the time he comes back, and I found myself not quite caring anymore (Although Russell does up the camp, when the tables are turned, at the finish for some brilliant laughs).So, overall, the experience at the Grindhouse was fantastic. Rodriguez was on fire with both Planet Terror and his faux trailer Machete and Tarantino knew the score if he didn't quite know how to pace his piece correctly. I even loved the fact that characters reoccurred throughout, even if that gimmick went a bit too far having Biehn's and Jordan Ladd's roles reprised in the trailers as well. As for those trailers: pure unadulterated fun. Rob Zombie and Eli Roth did fantastic jobs at putting the craziest ideas they had on screen knowing they didn't have to coherently put them together, as trailers just show disparate glimpses anyways. Biggest laughs of the night, though, go to Edgar Wright and his trailer for Don't. It was hilarious and I loved the cameo by Wright regular Nick Frost, priceless. These guys have whet my appetite for more double-bill goodness, and hopefully Rodriguez and Tarantino will live up to the speculation and do a Grindhouse every few years or so.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Message to Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez!,"I know one of you will read this. You have to. This was the best movie experience of my life. Never a dull Moment. But you must do one thing. PLEASE PLEASE really make Machete. Danny Trejo and Cheech need to have this. The public needs to have this. On the behalf of everyone in Jacksonville please make this movie. I will donate money to you. Machete will be the greatest movie ever. Everything else was killer. Nicholas Cage's surprise appearance was great. My girlfriend thought it would be cool if you two teamed up with Rob Zombie, then low and behold in the middle we get Werewolf women of the SS. I almost fell out of my seat. Hands down the greatest thing I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hard to beat for best film of '07,"It would be hard to defend this nostalgic double-feature film as a masterpiece, but I can, without any guilt, say that it was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had at the theater. It's not just a movie; it can legitimately be called an experience. Rodriguez's segment, Planet Terror, is probably the more easily enjoyed and more consistently enjoyable of the films. Kind of a rip-off of Romero's Dead series, but that makes perfect sense as it's supposed to be a cheap fright flick. And what easier way to make a cheap fright flick than to rip off a good one? Planet Terror feels exactly like what it is supposed to be, with its disgusting gore, lame jokes and Godawful acting (star Freddy Rodriguez, the segment's male lead, excels at this so well it's downright spooky). And, what's better, it rarely seems to be winking at the audience when it's doing these things. It's an all-out ball. Tarantino's segment, Death Proof, is a more confounding animal. After Planet Terror, any movie might seem a little slow. But Death Proof really is a slow burn. It starts off with a very 70s-ish feel, with outdated hairstyles and bad acting that feels like it comes from bad movies of that era. But then, about halfway through, it changes tones entirely and becomes a very modern-feeling movie, with mostly pretty good performances. The dialogue throughout is very much in the Tarantino vein, and let us not forget that it was his dialogue that made him famous. The structure of the film kind of seemed nouvelle vague-esquire, and of course Tarantino was a big fan of that movement. When Death Proof gets to its climax, though, it's pure adrenaline rush. The film references (aloud) Dirty Marry Crazy Larry, Vanishing Point and Gone in 60 Seconds, and then ends with one of the most entertaining car chases in cinema history. However disjointed Death Proof feels, it's still a damn fun movie. And the two halves of Grindhouse might not comment on each other much (they do briefly share the same universe, in one weird sequence), but the entire thing just rocks. Add to that several fake trailers for other cheesy movies (my favorite being the first one, Machete, of which a feature length version is supposedly already in production), and you've really got yourself some cinematic gold. It'll be a shame when Harvey ""Scissorhands"" Weinstein cuts it in two in a short while here, because it's all about the entire experience. Right now it's the film to beat for '07.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is what Horror is all ABOUT!,"A movie of this calibre is a long time coming! Finally, a full out, in your face, splash 'em, slash 'em gore fest! Planet Terror rolls out the escapades in its tale of science gone horribly wrong. As a horror filmmaker, and special effects guru, I am delighted to report that this is the ONLY movie ever to make me gag! The effect laden twists and turns follow genre as one would expect, but adds so much more to the foray.Well written, brilliantly directed, Planet Terror features some of the best acting to be seen in horror. Gloriously over the top in places, the story moves quickly, and ends much in the manner of the classics. What else would one expect from a master such as Robert Rodriquez? The following ""Prevues"" are brilliant in their decadence and so bang on with the era depicted that one is actually sorry to see them end and the next feature begin. Special kudo's to Eli Roth's ""Thanksgiving"" tale, a hilarious yet gory peek into a twisted mind like no other.The latter on the two movies is Tarantino's ""Death Proof"". Quantrary to a lot of other reviews, I personally found it a bit lacking and drawn out in places.A filmmaker totally in love with dialogue, ""Death Proof"" drags in scenes where Tarantino feels the need to flex his writing skills. Most of it is interesting, but grows old quickly.Lacking a true structure and blind to genre specifics, ""Death Proof"" still works on a whole, mostly due to the great acting. Kurt Russsell is so despicable, yet interesting that we want to watch him.Setting up opportunities to really get crazy, then passing them by is almost trademark Tarantino, though in this case it would have been nice to see him delve deeper into the doors he opened.As a whole, Grindhouse is a must see for every horror fan out there. Great concepts can keep you in your seat for 3+ hours!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blood and Stupid =),"wow i'm amazed =) so much crap in so little time, so many idiots on such a small screen =) if this movie was made by anyone else it would have gotten the 4 to 5 stars a common horror movie with a poor story usually scores, but -heyo- one name of FAME and the monkeys come screaming ""GREAT"" --- it really isn't... no, its nothing special or in anyway original... the only thing special about it, is that it'll be overrated like all the other bloodfilled effectshows Tarantino did. This is satisfying the deep and neverending lust for sensation which exists in all of us. All you need to make a film like this is money... not talent.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
perfect film for those who have knowledge of a Grindhouse film,"Not a lot of people know what a Grindhouse film is or they have a knowledge of it but don't fully understand it. These films were meant to be bad films. They are made to be very cheesy. Not all of them are violent but i'd say 98% of them are. If you look up a definition of grindhouse it reads ""a double-feature film that exploits violence and sex."" So pretty much everything you see in that film fits to the Grindhouse categorey.Planet Terror was the zombie movie created but Robert Rodriguez. It is extremely violent and I will admit that the violence does go a little over the top for a film like this, but the actors did do a very good job at playing their parts, especially Freddy Rodriguez. He played his character very well and made him sound very cheesy.A lot of people who saw this film will probably tell you that Death Proof, Tarantino's film, sucked big time or it was just boring. I beg to differ. Yes, it may seem boring at times where there is just a lot of rambling and there are people just talking. Well how many good horror films have you seen where there were just a bunch of guys and girls that are just sitting around and just talking. There is a reasoning behind that. The more talking there is the more anxious you get for the action scenes and when when they come they are more exciting. You will not be disappointed with Death Proof because in the film there is probably one of the best car chases I have ever seen.Overall this film was very good and I recommend everyone to try and see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Grindhouse,"Grindhouse features two full length feature films plus some fake trailers in between the two films. The two films plus the trailers are supposed to look and feel like the cult and exploitation films that were made in the 70's and appeared often as double bills at the drive in. For those unaware or unsure if they have ever seen an exploitation or ""grind house"" film then you should know that they are usually films not made for a lot of money, often they look very grainy and have black lines every once in awhile going down the screen, cracking and popping noises during the film, not very good acting, often a lot of sex, violence and other things which usually made them X rated and usually they were very sensationalistic films meaning that pretty much everything in those type of movies were over the top from the acting, to the story and of course the violence and sex. Exploitation films started early and often tried to be educational such as the film Reefer Madness which has now become sort of a comedy classic because nobody takes it seriously anymore. Other sub genres of the exploitation era were blaxploitation (and featured such films as Shaft and Blacula), sexploitation (which featured any film by Russ Meyer such as Supervixens or Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!), shock films which were meant to be pretty shocking and repulsive, women in prison films and much much more. Basically if you have seen a film from the 70's with any of the criteria I have mentioned in this review with the few examples I have given, then you have seen a grind house film. So, I don't go on forever about this genre I will skip right to my review of this film Grindhouse in which there are two feature length films one being called Planet Terror and written and directed by Robert Rodriguez and the other is Death Proof which is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Having been a big fan of cult and exploitation films since I was a teenager I have noticed that often with these type of films the critics tend to give a lot away in their reviews and spoil all the fun, so I will not go into any detail whatsoever about what the two films, or even the fake trailers are about and I will instead tell you what I liked, or should I say loved about this double feature. As I mentioned above I love cult and exploitation cinema. To many people they would just be classified as trashy or good for nothing films, but I have always loved how fun, shocking and sometimes unintentionally funny they could be. Plus in my opinion any of those exploitation films from the 70's is more fun than any Hollywood popcorn summer movie they are releasing these days. Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino and the guest directors who made the fake trailers completely captured everything I loved about these 70's films and put it into this double feature. The films were entertaining, captured the look and dialogue of the 70's films and every last detail was done to perfection. If I were to pull out one of my exploitation films from the 70's out from my vast DVD and video collection and actually sat down and compared those films to these two films made in 2007 and meant to look like the 70's then I think it would look absolutely the same and everything they captured from the feel to the way of storytelling is so perfectly done it is amazing. Of course with all exploitation films they are likely to offend or turn off some, but I always liked that and I had a blast seeing this in theatres. These films entertained me and reminded me of the past films I loved. Also the fake trailers were done to perfection as well and if you have ever seen a 70's movie trailer then you know you really need to commend these guest directors for doing such a great job. For being one of the most fun, campy, outrageous and totally entertaining films I have ever seen in a theatre plus bringing me back memories from my favourite films and capturing the essence of them completely then you can probably already guess I loved Grindhouse. If this film sounds like it would be right up your alley then make sure to see it in theatres because it is one of the most fun theatre experiences I have ever had.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Like If Scorsese and Coppola Got Together To Make a Double Feature Called ""Italian""","Robert Rodriguez's feature, Planet Terror, has a script that is not purely the stuff of B-list cheese chock full of blood, goop, breasts, and guns. It is purely the recycling of that stuff from an eager fanatic's mind. While it's being set up, it's very intriguing, but like all Rodriguez films, its sustained plot later on is stale and routine. Also as always, his stories are held together by the single clever quality in them, which is the inventiveness of weaponry and scenes of violence, the main instance being namely in this case Rose McGowan's large machine gun attached to her body in place of a severed leg.It has a wonderful atmosphere during its exposition. It switches around several characters in different settings, all fashioned with a surreal, exotic style. Simultaneously, Rodriguez very much keeps in the vein of grindhouse mimic. The screen is grainy throughout every frame and intermittently distorted and fumbled by an incompetent fantasy projectionist, and the amateurish spirit of the film is entirely appropriate, even if that quality bears no difference from the rest of Rodriguez's movies.What is concerning me the most about Rodriguez's latter films is his increasingly blatant affinity for castration. It all started with Once Upon A Time In Mexico when Antonio Banderas crushed two men's genitals into a jelly with his bare hands. His next film, Sin City, contains three major castration scenes, not to mention several references and threats pertaining to groin violence throughout. Now in Grindhouse, there's a character who has a collection of testicles of the men who've betrayed, crossed, or failed him, complete with a scene that demonstrates this. This is a ridiculous, troublesome and largely disconcerting phase Rodriguez must promptly nip in the bud before it grows out of hand, as the subject seems to grow more prominent in each film, and he becomes known for this by a unanimously concerned audience. It doesn't help much when the dog violence occurs, after he seemingly gains our trust that he will not give into the dog casualty cliché.Overall, Planet Terror is more Rodriguez fun-fluff with passion not so much driving the story and expression but the technical film-making itself, and not even in the language of it but in the fun to which Rodriguez always panders in the mere use of a blue screen, holding the camera himself, editing it himself, scoring it himself. This is perfect, however, for the theme and nostalgia of Grindhouse.Tarantino's Death Proof is a different story. Death Proof is a work of more substance. The script is focused on the chemistry and relationships between its female friends, and it portrays these characters and their interactions with what Tarantino might seem to think of as realism. The story moves with an undoubted, forceful unpredictability. Its surprises are the stuff of real movies with a narrative manipulating decent thrills and reactions from its audience. This is all good, but is it the stuff of grindhouse cinema? Death Proof begins with the look and feel of an old 1970s camp flick, but gradually that fades and Tarantino cannot help or hide that it is a real movie. The reason for this is that honestly Tarantino is and always has been above ""grindhouse"" cinema and kung fu or Z-list car chase popcorn flicks. His movies, despite his desperate attempts to portray them as sendbacks to this class of cinema, have always resonated with the expression of a real and gifted filmmaker. I think that the reason the grain and inept projectionist gimmick in his cinematography here fades is because he cannot help but shoot and craft a film the best way he can to tell the story in the most effective possible way, not that he does but that is a goal he seems to indecisively try to reach.Death Proof has a pretty terrific car chase, and when seen in the theater, as this film within the fabric of the outer movie Grindhouse is strictly intended to be. Does the chase begin as yet another ""homage"" of his to an earlier favorite? Yes. Is it gripping and are your feet pressing harder and harder against the floor as if you yourself are urgently trying to control the brakes and gas pedals of the cars in frustration caused by suspense? Yes.The film's vital flaw, a summation of all of its smaller flaws, is that unfortunately both features are interchangeable. Rodriguez's Planet Terror has the theme and nostalgia but none of the wit and narrative passion, and Tarantino's Death Proof is virtually vice versa, just as one could say when comparing any other given pairing of movies by the two men. If Grindhouse's nostalgic statement were not so painstakingly clear based on the fake trailers and the two feature directors' previous work, then it would be lost in what's basically a double feature of two directors who are doing nothing more than what they always do. What both don't seem to realize (or maybe they don't care) is that they've made entire careers out of paying homage to grindhouse. For the fifteen years both directors have been working, they've not yet made truly personal work. They've stayed perpetually in the mindset of the ol' days of fun, bad no-brainer movies. The only difference is that Rodriguez doesn't seem to have any potential beyond that sort of film and Tarantino seems to fear making a movie that's entirely his own, perhaps because if he did, then he couldn't deflect criticism with justifications prepared by his uses of homage.The highest points of the movie really are the trailers before and in between features. They are some of the most entertainment and hilarity you will ever get from going to a movie theater. They are what truly make you feel like you are in that fantasy world, where you really feel like you're in some old sleazeball movie house from generations ago.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Quite possibly the most entertaining movie ever made.,"Grindhouse was, without a doubt, the most fun time I've ever had in a theater. It exceeded every single one of my expectations, and boy did I have high expectations for this movie. From the opening trailer, to the very last cutscene, Grindhouse keeps you laughing, cringing, thrilled, and in a complete state of awe.The order of the film itself goes like this: first, we have a campy, ""El Mariachi"" meets ""Payback"" Mexican shoot-em-up called Machete, starring, quite fittingly, Danny Trejo, as a hit-man turned vigilante after his employers double-crossed him. He then teams up with his brother the padre (oxymoron), and they set out to get their rightful revengeAfter an oddly hilarious ""restricted"" warning involving a bunch of cats playing with some yarn, we move onto the main event of the film, Robert Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"". Planet Terror is basically ""Return of the Living Dead"" (very high up on the entertainment scale as well) on steroids. We aren't given zombies. We're given superhuman ""sickos"". These guys are a by product of some biochemical weapons stolen by a bunch of mercenaries led by Bruce Willis. They then get double-crossed by the scientist responsible for the creation of the weapons Naveen Andrews. Thrown into the mix is a slew of other characters each one multi-layered and lovable. We are then given the gun-legged goddess, Rose McGowan, and we have ourselves some of the coolest scenes in movie history. From death by helicopter blades, to accidentally shooting one's face off, it is all found in Planet TerrorINTERMISSION! During this short break we are given three outstandingly hilarious fake movie trailers. First, we have Rob Zombie's ""Werewolf Women of the SS"", which in my opinion is the least entertaining of the bunch. Yet the hilarious Nicholas Cage cameo as Fu Manchu, a Chinese ""Master of the Flying Guillotine"" look alike who bellows out ""THIS IS MY MECCA!!"" made it all worthwhile. Next we have Edgar Wright's ""Don't"", easily the best of the three. ""If you plan on opening the door.... DON'T!"", ""If you plan on going into the basement, DON'T"". We have absolutely no idea what the plot is, all we know is that the word don't is said about fifty times, making it one of the most quotable parts of the movie. Next in line is Eli Roth's ""Thanksgiving"". Eli Roth being the sick, sadistic nut he is, decided to go overboard on the senseless violence. This could not have fit in with the genre any better. The nostalgia of seeing this 70's ""holiday slasher"" type movie reminded me so much of ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"".After another freaky ""restricted"" warning involving a weird animated cat, we move onto Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof"". Death Proof is ""Highwaymen"" meets the original ""The Hiitcher"". Kurt Russel perfectly fits the role of a complete and total maniacal psychopath lunatic named ""Stuntman Mike"" who gets his kicks out of running over women with his really cool looking Chevy Nova. Death Proof took a different turn from Planet Terror, and really took its character development to the point that we really cared about the characters. Soon we get one of the most graphic, yet beautiful car crashes in cinema history, played over and over again in a different character's point of view each time, a marvelous trick reminding us of Quentin's directorial prowess. After that, the real fun begins. We have ourselves a new set of girls. Stuntman Mike can't resist yet unbeknownst to him that two of these girls are Stuntwomen themselves, he tries to run them off the road in one of the most edge of your seat thrilling car chases on film. After that its the girls vs. Stuntman Mike in a hilarious thrill ride that keeps you in constant suspenseThe Verdict: Both movies are completely different, yet share a vast number of similar traits, aspects, even characters. You're never bored at the Grindhouse, and this movie can and will be watched over and over again.Entertainment: 15/10 Originality: 8/10 Cool Factor: 10/10 Interest Level: 10/10 (That's right, no boredom here)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rodriguez tributes the zombie apocalypse genre; Tarantino pays homage to himself,"The concept of Grindhouse is superb. Take short exploitation style films from two highly admired directors, mix in some mock trailers and whackiness, and you could have a delightful night of entertainment.For me, Rodriguez's installment was very enjoyable. There are a few obvious inconsistencies with characters randomly resurfacing, but the draw of this feature was never meant to be a deeply developed plot or dialogue. ""Planet Terror"" works exactly on the level it is supposed to, as a witty half-serious zombie horde shoot-em-up. Everyone I was with seemed to have a good time during ""Planet Terror"", a nice mix of laughs to compliment the groans elicited by some of the gallows humor.Unfortunately, I felt the effort involved in ""Death Proof"" was not quite worthy of the Tarantino legacy. Love him or hate him, QT typically brings something unique to a picture. This time around, not so much. A significant amount of the footage in ""Death Proof"" is used as a platform for Tarantino to pay homage to himself. If you've seen Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and other previous works by QT you will recognize the dialogue references, and there are many of them. The first few instances of QT-tributes-QT made me laugh, but eventually the extent of the self adulation just seemed annoying. Certainly it took a skillful eye to recreate the camera shots of R.D.'s diner conversation so faithfully in ""Death Proof"", but I longed for more of the clever and original dialogue that is usually present in a Tarantino film. Nobody walked out at my theatre, but the audience certainly wasn't as involved in ""Death Proof"" as it had been for ""Planet Terror"".The two-for-one special and the great fake trailers make me hesitantly still recommend ""Grindhouse"" as an enjoyable detour, but Death Proof seems like it might have missed the exit sign.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
May have set the bar too high for future films,"I've been anticipating this movie since the day it was announced so I very easily could have over-hyped it for myself and been let down. Needless to say, I was not. I could sift through and pick out a few flaws. I could say that ""Planet Terror"" is pretty mindless and relies too much on testicular sight gags. I could say that ""Death Proof"" drags a little in the middle. But then I look at the big picture and these flaws are not even worth mentioning. This movie had so much in it's favor; more than just about any film out there can offer. Even besides packing in two very good films, you get some hilarious fake trailers (one now being made for straight to video) as well as other odd vintage film clips including an ad for a taco joint and an inexplicably long animated intro letting us know that ""Death Proof"" has a restricted rating.""Planet Terror"" doesn't take itself seriously for a single (scratched and damaged) frame. It may have been a disaster if it did. Instead, Rodriguez just awards us with countless scenes of over-the-top zombie violence. The acting is intentionally terrible and that's a good thing. His score clearly mimics that of John Carpenter's early films and works very well at setting the silly tone. It also acts as a constant reminder that you really shouldn't be thinking too hard. Normally I might cringe at something like this but Rodriguez has proved over the years that he can always come up with creative and entertaining action scenes, even if his characters and story run a little flat. This movie plays to his strengths.""Death Proof"" gave a more real feeling of tension and is probably the better movie even if it's not constantly hitting you in the face with exploding heads. It's chock full of everything you've come to expect from a Tarantino movie. Lengthy pop culture discussions, multiple shots of women's bare feet, 70's music and cool cars. Some will be turned off no doubt by the odd structure and the lengthy girl-chat discussions. The result, though, is probably the most enjoyable and exciting action sequences in recent years. After sitting through all the build up the pay off delivers on all levels because you become part of the group of characters on screen.When I walked out of the theater I saw a big display for ""Live Free or Die Hard"". As I looked at it I said ""I just can't care about Die Hard right now."" I'm a huge fan of the first 3 but Grindhouse was such an event to take part in that the usual summer flare Hollywood offers us just doesn't seem that appealing anymore. Maybe this is the slap in the wrist that studios need to break apart their nest of remakes and comic book adaptations, a trend that doesn't seem to want to end anytime soon. I'm sure legions of movie goers will flock to go see Spiderman swing around CGI New York for a third time but I'd much rather spend my time at the Grindhouse.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
You Must see,"I will first talk about Planet Terror. Planet Terror is the first of two films in grind house, and it is hands down the best. Rose Mcgowan is great in her role and so is Freddy Rodriguez. This was the most enjoyable zombie movie I have ever seen and yet also the best film i have ever seen. A spectacular film. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.Now lets talk about Death Proof, the second film of grind house. This film should have been shown first because I was way too blown away by Planet Terror. Death Proof is good in its own right, but there was alittle more dialogue than i was used to because the previous film was just so action packed. But nevertheless, a good film.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Action Packed Thrill Ride that Lived up to the Hype.,"I love this movie. I liked both movies. I did like ""Planet Terror"" better. I thought it was going to be a spoof of Zombie movies, instead it was a tribute that outdid the source material in the same way the Indiana Jones outdid the movies it was a tribute to. Total Kick ass and well done.The blond Doctor and her problem getting into the car was one of the best parts. Despite all the gore, her scene had more of the theater gasp than any other.This was the first time I ever found Rose McGowan really attractive. She was extremely hot and actually looked pretty at the same time.Who is Freddy Rodríguez and why was he so damn good? Jeff Fahey was great as J.T. & the scene with his brother (Michael Biehn) and the recipe was pretty good.I thought Tarantino as an actor was good in ""Deathproof"" and bad in ""Planet Terror"".Danny Trejo and Cheech had the best cameo's in what I thought was the best Trailer. I would actually like to go see ""Machete"" if they make it.I roared at Nicolas Cage's part.Zoe Bell looked like she had a huge amount of fun playing herself.It took me a while to recognize Lee was the pretty actress that played Gwen in Sky High opposite Kurt Russell again.Anyway, I really enjoyed both movies and the trailers.

Best movie of the Year!,"I had very high hopes for this movie after seeing Sin City. I am no real fan of Quentin Tarantino, but Robert Rodriguez has proved to be nothiing short of amazing. This film is a masterpiece by both men.I wasn't sure what to expect and I won't post any spoilers. But this s basically two feature length movies, one by each director. There are also ""previews"" for other Grindhouse movies. All of them are enjoyable.The directing is good, the acting is amazing and the films are written and produced well. But more than anything, they are just damn enjoyable.Things to take note of: there is a lot of gore in the movies and quite a few scenes that will make you jump because you don't expect them. There is the violence you expect from these two directors throughout the films. Some of it may make you squeamish.Anyhow, I recommend watching it even more than once. I am going back tomorrow to catch another showing of this movie. See it in a big audience with tons of other people and watch how they and you react. It will be hard to top Grindhouse as the best movie of the year!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a load of rubbish,"Please do not waste three hours of your life watching this self indulgent rubbish. Quentin Tarentino has stooped to an all time low. An absolute waste of time. The first film is barely watchable, but the second is absolutely pointless. The acting is terrible and even Kurt Russell cannot save the day. Why are we subjected to this very poor film making because of the 'name' of the director?

Transcendental...Grindhouse cinema on steroids...,"I viewed this film on April 6th, and I am genuinely satisfied with this project. I first heard about this film way back in October when the 1st Annual Scream Awards aired. Ever since then I have been anticipating this extravaganza. This film was great foreplay for Easter weekend.As Roger Ebert said that Kill Bill was transcendental of its inspirations, so it is with Grindhouse. This film is definitely an homage to the grind house tradition, but it accomplishes more at the same time. What this film lacks is nudity, however, in every other area it delivers: outrageous gore, offbeat characters, a cast of beautiful women, sensational plots, visual artifacts (creating an atmosphere of surreal camp) and overall shock value.First, I address Planet Terror which is arguably the stronger effort. This film is a fascinating hybrid of contradictory styles and aesthetics. On one hand, Rodriguez uses rather extreme color timing effects to create an appearance of worn out film. However, underneath the scratches and off-hue colors is a pristine high definition print and state of the art special effects. This visual hybridization works beautifully in my opinion, as it creates a surreal world in which the boundaries between the past and the present dissolve away.Planet Terror also boosts a mesmerizing soundtrack that perfectly sets the mood for tense scenes (as in the hospital scene between Shelton and Brolin) and also conveys the ""grind"" element with the main theme from the opening titles. This music is much better than most Grindhouse films, with the exception of certain blaxploitation and spaghetti western films.Overall, Planet Terror blends the best of grind house cinema styling with contemporary technology.Death Proof, like Planet Terror succeeds in creating a powerful atmosphere full of retroactive ambiance. Death Proof is less overtly ""damaged"" than Planet Terror, and yet it utilizes more old school techniques. Tarantino shot his segment with actual film, and he restrained himself to using only practical special effects, free of CGI. His fonts are right on the money. Like Planet Terror, Death Proof still looks superior to most of the films that inspired it.Once again, Tarantino provides a colorful soundtrack which sets the mood for the film. The music is at times creepy, adrenaline pumping, and groovy when appropriate. Furthermore, as with most Tarantino films, the use of classic songs from the 1970's helps to create the feeling of nostalgia. This film is also very self-referential, as the characters talk about other grind house film, such as Vanishing Point, when they are in fact in a ""grind house"" film of their own. This film creates a very potent world that also feels surreal. On one end of the spectrum, the costumes, make-up, vehicles, sets, and other props all sport a great amount of detail and polish, whereas the color timing and the editing create an unrefined and unvarnished appearance. So once again, as with Planet Terror, polish and high production value meet the elements of low production value to create a world that transcends categorization in any specific era.The Trailers The TRAILERS THE TRAILERS! All three trailers are what send the quality of this project over the top and make for a true homage to the grind house form.Machete, despite also having major special effects is very convincing as a film that could be from the past. Danny Trejo delivers such intensity in his performance that it pumps me up, and this may finally make him the star he deserves to be. I read that this film will be available as a straight to video DVD, Oh YEAH! Mexican exploitation at its BEST! Next, Werewolf Women of the SS is a hilarious idea of a film blending the werewolf film style with the Nazi exploitation film style that boosts a tremendously tantalizing cast.Don't is a British haunted house exploitation film that is an exercise in hilarity. If this trailer doesn't inspire laughter, perhaps nothing will. This also looks very real, almost too real. If one didn't know better, they would probably think they were watching a trailer for a genuine film of the 1970's.Finally, another surprisingly realistic trailer is that of Thanksgiving which is like Halloween on LSD or something. This trailer has the funniest tag lines in my opinion, as it employs many verbal puns that beg laughter from those who love dark humor. I wish this film, in particular, would be full-length as well, because it looks really promising, particularly in the dark creativity of the murder scenes. Ican't stress how genuine this awesome trailer feels.Oh how I wish they would make all the trailers full length features available on DVD, if not as theatrical features.This is not merely a copycat of a old school grind house double feature. This is a transcendental project that represents grind house cinema on STEROIDS having traveled approximately 30 YEARS into the future. This is not the grind house cinema of generations past, this is the grind house cinema of the present.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Absolutely Fantastic,"This movie was probably the greatest movie I have ever seen in a theater.(maybe even in my life) I loved every second of it. I laughed my head off, squealed of disgust, and suffered cardiac arrest all at once.Planet terror was gruesome, disgusting, and nauseating and i loved every second of it. Never thought i would like it so much considering i can't even sit comfortably while learning about biology and what not because i'm so squeamish.Death Proof was at first a little boring and seemed like it was going no where until the action started, and that was extremely, extremely exciting. I never cheered for justice so much in my life. And one of the best parts about it were the fake advertisements and missing reel messages which just made you even happier to not be anywhere else.This was everything i was looking for in a movie. Even the fact that it was three hours no longer bothered me as soon as i sat down. I never wanted it to end but when it did i immediately stood and applauded. I didn't even mind the fact that i payed double to see it because i lost my first ticket. $18.00? Screw it, it was sooo worth it. If you didn't like this movie then your just plain boring.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
((tHE bOTTOM liNE)) must see,"The bottom line : Grindhouse is a must-see. Tarantino fans, u'll be pleased. Rodriguez fans, u'll be pleased. grindhouse fans, u'll be pleased. Planet Terror was a brilliant flick by itself. Had its share of gore, violence, sleaze and mindlessness. And that is what was promised. And delivered. It was just so brilliantly done, i wouldn't mind watching it another 5 times. And not to mention the brilliant soundtracks. Coming to the trailers added to the movie, hilarious hilarious. Do not get up to get some grub when they are on. They are a great break themselves. Absolutely wonderful. And then came Death Proof. I had some mixed feelings about this. It was a great Tarantino flick, however, i was left with a feeling it was just a Tarantino flick and not a Grindhouse flick. I am a huge Tarantino fan and the movie was absolutely Tarantino material, but i was a little disappointed because i did not go to watch a Tarantino movie. i went to watch Tarantino doing his bit in a grindhouse movie. but a great experience nevertheless. don't miss out on it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Incredible!,"What makes this double feature so genius is that it is gratuitous for the sake of topping itself, but it's all done with a knowing manipulation of the cinematic medium. These guys deliver massive entertainment with an artful approach.Right away, Rodriguez borders on blasphemy by having a priest join Danny Trejo in an ass kicking trailer. He even lights their faces with crosses. As soon as Planet Terror starts, it relishes in gore so gross it's funny like Evil Dead 2.Since it was previewed so early, I was wondering how anything else in the film could top the gun leg. By the time the film actually gets to that, you've already seen so much more crazy stuff. They still use the gun for a big payoff, but I was more in awe of Marley Shelton's hands.There is enough crazy, gory action to fill several films, but Rodriguez packs his with even more depth. Tangential characters become scene stealing plot points, backstories are elaborately soap operatic and the inter-relationships between the characters pay off.The cast acts different levels of ham. There's wide-eyed Marley Shelton, badass Freddy Rodriguez, ignorantly authoritative Michael Beihn, tragically sexy Rose McGowan and pure A-hole Josh Brolin. Each style serves its purpose in this retro reference perfectly.After Planet Terror when the intermission card comes on, please, don't be an idiot and get up to leave. No modern movie really has an intermission. Come on, people. I missed half of a fake trailer because some guy couldn't decide whether to walk out or sit back down.Death Proof slows things way down from the barrage of Planet Terror. It's all Quentin Tarantino dialogue. It may be slow, but it's all mood. It gets going good with one of the screen's most interesting stalkers and most visceral mass murder.It's Tarantino's idea of girl talk, vulgar sex stories and such, but I wouldn't presume that women don't talk that way. Of course everyone speaks more extremely in Tarantino's world. There's some pop culture reference too, and a well thought out self defense talk. It may seem like old hat, but it turns out he's just making you think it's the same old thing. Really, he's got a big payoff in store, way bigger than the stupid exploding palm on Bill.Death Proof may only have one extended action scene (after the first kill shot), but it is so outrageous it may even erase the memories of Planet Terror. Every time you think you know where it's going, where one of those other movies would go, it keeps pushing. There are points where you may say they could just stop the car, but don't even worry about that. It's not going to end how you think.The fake film scratches work for artistic effect. They minimize in parts of the film so you're not looking at warped footage constantly. Then they get more and more F'ed up in key places, with intentionally odd cuts. You just know they're going to pull a film rip at some point, but Rodriguez actually works it into the story. You can feel him giggling and pulling the ultimate prank on his audience, one that we'll love him even more for. Interestingly though, Tarantino's portion is far less grunged up. Hmmm.This is easily Robert Rodriguez's masterwork. All of his creativity has culminated to epic proportions. Tarantino has never looked this joyfully over the top. F*** it, this is the best movie ever made. I may regret saying that next time I watch Toy Story 2, but actually, since it's two movies, even if each one is only four out of five stars, that still adds up to eight which is more than any single movie can have!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Grindhouse is a damn good time, despite it's flaws","Grindhouse is a real pet project for directors Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. A throwback to the days of no holds barred, violent, harried exploitation films that played in rundown movie houses, Grindhouse proves to be a very fun and enthralling time at the movies. However, recreating and living up to the classic look and feel of the grindhouse movies of the heyday proves to the biggest challenge for the duo of filmmakers.The film begins with Rodriguez at the wheel. His trailer for ""Machete"" is mad fun. Danny Trejo and Jeff Fahey as good guy and bad guy respectively complete with gunfire, bare breasts and Cheech Marin as a gun toting Priest make for a great faux trailer. However, the fact that it's too good and too slick takes it away from the grindhouse aesthetic. Later in the evening, you'll see more trailers: Edgar Wright's ""Don't!"" a 70s style British scare film, Rob Zombie's ""Werewolf Women of the SS"" complete with S&M Nazis and Nicholas Cage making a cameo as Fu Manchu. Also, you get Eli Roth's ""Thanksgiving"" a bloody slasher film covering the holiday that the genre previously missed. All the trailers are amusing, but Edgar Wright's and Eli Roth's come off as the most authentic and faithful to the grindhouse style of the 1970's.The first feature is Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" a fairly standard zombie splatter fest that benefits with good casting and the feisty sexiness of Rose McGowan. The film is too big in scale to be truly grindhouse, but it's never boring and the gore effects prove to be quite creative.The second film is Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" which takes the fast car stylings of ""Vanishing Point"" and ""Dirty Mary Crazy Larry"" and puts it into the structure of a slasher film. The problem with this film is that Tarantino is so focused on his masterful dialog and tongue in cheek references that he seems to be forgetting that it's supposed to be a grindhouse outing. ""Death Proof"" has grindhouse ingredients (sexy girls, a retro 70s production design and soundtrack. Even the opening credits are a real hoot.) But it's beautiful widescreen photography and big scope brings it out of it's small inspiration. Grindhouse films were cheap, small, had no movie stars. Both ""Planet Terror"" and ""Death Proof"" take the grindhouse spirit in great stride, but amplify it to the Hollywood level. This creates a great conflict. Both films are too big and too elaborate to fit in the true grindhouse aesthetic.But then again, does that really matter? What really matters is that ""Grindhouse"" is damn bloody wickedness. Both movies have moments that are shocking and transgressive. ""Death Proof"" has an extended car chase that is the most harrowing I've seen in years. The blood and titillation flow with great shameless glee. It's a rare treat to see two very talented filmmakers go nuts at the movie factory with a devil may care attitude. In the days of overpriced nights at the movies, ""Grindhouse"" is a cinematic kick in the crotch. Two movies that, despite flaws, are engaging, sexy, unapologetic, sometimes jaw dropping but never dull.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
3 hours of crazy fun,"I saw a sneak preview last night St. Louis and really enjoyed the movies. Planet Terror was my favorite, it was gory, campy, funny and had the whole audience laughing, screaming, and moaning. I haven't seen that much response from a movie crowd in a long time.Death Proof was also very good but had a much slower pace with more character interaction. Once the action picks up however it's balls to the wall and you see a really great car chase with a very awesome ending.The fake movie trailers were also a lot of fun and the whole movie experience was very cool. These movies are not for everyone but I found it a very fun and entertaining 3 hours.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Grindhouse,"Went & saw this movie at a special pre-screening last night. For all the people out there who love bloody gory older types of movies this is for you! This is one of the most original concepts for a whole movie in a long time. Defaintly a break from the same old same old remake of every movie or concept ever made. If you liked the style of Rob Zombies House of 1,000 Corpses or Devil's Rejects this movie wont disappoint in the slightest (& FYI he dose direct a quick movie preview starring Sherri Moon & Bill Mosley) Both movies were really good Planet Terror that makes you want to gag to the non-stop action of Death Proof. Then to top it off you get the humor of all the coming attractions or other commericals thrown in there. Defaintly the movie of the year!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pure Genius. GRINDHOUSE makes cinema good again.,"Going into this, one knows what they are getting into. (One helluva fun time!)As soon as the lights go off and the movie starts, the viewer is put into a time machine and transported back in to the 70's when exploitation films were at their highest. And for that Misters Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino should be honored as the greatest filmmakers in the world. They certainly have made one of the best films in the world. The viewer is first pulled in by the first 3 seconds, hair scratches, sound pops, stuff a viewer is not used to in a fancy theater. But it is there, all part of the movie, all part of the experience. We are welcomed with a trailer from Robert Rodriguez, ""Machete"", starring the Danny Trejo, the man the created High Definition for. This trailer is hilarious along with the others, but my personal favorite has to be Eli Roth's sick ""Thanksgiving"" trailer. Funny. So funny. First up is Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" which is certainly the most action-packed of the two films in this double feature. There are many, many hilarious parts especially when Quentin himself appears on the screen. Rose McGowan burns the screen up (litterally). She wears her beauty proud in this movie. Freddy Rodriguez plays an ultra-bad-ass (perfectly) and Marley Shelton is very fine to look at as well. The cast is huge and really great. Planet Terror is a movie that nobody will take a break from to use the bathroom. Well paced and just so much fun to watch. Not to mention the insanely catchy theme music by Rodriguez is just delicious and so is Rose McGowan with a machine gun for a leg. For some reason, it is really hot, and it works. Then, after that zombie romp is ""Death Proof"", Tarantino's effort. This film is very different from ""Planet Terror"" as in these films are two different sub-genres, but also because the viewer can tell that unlike Rodriguez, who just made a really fun exploitation film of his own, Tarantino honors those movies from the 70's. He also throws in plenty of references to older movies and a couple of homages to his own movies that are fun to pick up (Kill Bill 1 and Reservoir Dogs) ""Death Proof"" proves how amazing a writer Tarantino is because he is writing a movie that is pretty much all girl dialogue. Rosario Dawson, Rose McGowan (again) and others do an amazing job putting his words on the screen. Zoe Bell, a real life stuntwoman playing herself, is fantastic. She has the biggest balls that I have ever seen. Kurt Russell is back to his bad ass days playing the slasher 'Stuntman Mike.' He plays him with conviction and charisma that makes you smile. The movie starts out a bit slow, but it is all for a reason; to lead you in to one of the best car chase scenes in the history of film. That is no exaggeration. Why would it be? It's a Tarantino car chase. He tries to do the best stuff in any kind of thing dealing with film.All in all, ""Grindhouse"" was so good that I know I have to see it again. Take my word for it...it is worth the watch. So go watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Revolution in the movie industry,"Finally, a revolution in the movie industry. Grindhouse, i'm sure, will become a movie genre of its own now. I can never recall having this much fun in a movie theater. As a matter of fact, i cannot recall ever seeing people have this much fun in a movie theater. The directing, the stories, the acting, everything in this movie was amazing, different, awesome.The first movie, Planet Terror, will not only knock your socks off with the gore, but will also make you laugh. Every looser in the country will be masturbating to Rose McGowan now, she plays Chery Darling, a woman with a gun for a leg, and happens to be the hottest thing i've seen on TV since Scarlet Johanson in Match Point. This movie is packed with basically anything you could want in a movie, horror, comedy, great dialog, fun...The second movie, Death Proof, is not as gory, but does not fall under the bar on the fun level. First off all, I think that Tarantino if one of the best dialog writers in the movie industry. His dialogs make any bore chit chat, amazingly interesting. I will not say anything to spoil this movie, but Kurt Russel is great in this movie. He nails his role as Stuntman Mike, a psychotic thrill seeker. The ending, not only was it unpredictable, and extremely funny, but it was preceded by the best car chase in the history of film making. This movie is just what you want to see after paying 9 dollars at the theatre.Finally, before the movie starts, and in between both features, they show integrated previews for upcoming ""grindhouse genre"" films, such as Machete, something about Nazis and wolf women, and Thanksgiving. These small previews were just as fun as the movies, and I can't wait for them to come out. I guarantee you that these previews will generate loud blast of laughter out of you.This movie cannot be describe by words, it must be experienced at a movie theater. It is everything anyone would want in a movie. It is the new revolution of the movie industry, and i cannot wait for more Grindhouse movies to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Austin premiere!,"I attended the premiere in Austin with both directors and cast in the house. Which was cool since it was filmed in and around Austin. The film was a three hour in your face, anything goes, blood & guts, roller coaster ride.The men are tough, but women are tougher. You can't predict what's going to happen next.It's an interactive film with the audience screaming and cheering throughout. Both films(with 'trailers' in between) pay homage to the low-budget exploitation films of the 60s and 70s.(the film itself is scratched up and shaky) So no, this one is not for everyone. Fans of Sin City and Kill Bill should enjoy it though. I'll see it again myself when it opens April 6th.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lots o' fun,"As the previous reviewer stated, you have to go into this not expecting anything serious and just kick back & have a good time. It was great to see all the local Austin joints featured in the movie (especially in Death Proof). The ""preview"" bits before the film and during intermission are a riot, and really do feel like something you would see in a 1976 movie house. The choppy editing, bad special effects and other cheesy 70's B-movie-isms are hilarious and not overdone. Too bad there are so many ""missing"" film reels. We can't wait for the release of Machete. I could really see them doing another double feature like this, I'll bet they had a blast filming it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Manufactured, Processed Cult","Grindhouse is a fine example of what one can do with a name, some marketing, and absolutely no talent or thought.Tarantino and Rodriguez, unable or unwilling to devise a compelling or entertaining story, insulated themselves from all criticism by deliberately setting out to make a campy movie - If you dislike it, then you just didn't get it. The B-movies (God only knows what doof came up with the phrase ""Grindhouse"") used to be a product of their limitations in budget and time. In that respect, Grindhouse is just a little bit different, being a product of their writer/directors' creative limitations.Camp films didn't cost over twenty-million dollars to make. They also didn't have tens of millions of dollars in marketing. They also had a tendency to be entertaining (if accidentally) which is the one thing this movie (or movies) isn't.""Grindhouse"" is a fantastic movie, if acting, story, dialog, and entertainment value don't count.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent Double Features by two maverick filmmakers.,"In this double feature of One of the Top Filmmakers in Hollywood:Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. These two directors presents their films in the tradition of the 1970's and 1980's. Their films in presented with intentionally missing reels in both features and hilarious fake trailers in between their movies.The First Feature is ""Planet Terror"". When a go-go dancer (Rose McGowan) is searching for a better life. While of a group of soldiers (Lead by Bruce Willis) are infected with a virus. Which turns them into vicious, hungry, violent maniacs. While they searching for a cure. While they affect another people in a small Texas Town. This dancer finds help from her ex-boyfriend (Freddy Rodriguez) and a group of survivors. Which they are trying to get out of the small town before the virus spread upon the whole world.The Second Feature is ""Death Proof"". A seemingly charming stunt man, which ironically his name goes by Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell). Actually Stuntman Mike is a psychotic sexual predator that goes after attractive ladies. Which he's stalking them from afar and he also used his stunt car as a weapon. But he meets his match, when he meets a pair of Stunt Woman (Tracie Thoms and Zoe Bell) and an actress (Rosario Dawson). Which Stuntman Mike and The Ladies find themselves in a dangerous car race between life and death.""Planet Terror"" is Written and Directed by Robert Rodriguez (Spy Kids Trilogy, El Mariachi, The Faculty). Rodriguez's film is a tongue-in-cheek action feature with an fun blend of science-fiction and horror. McGowan offers an terrific, fresh, funny performance as the unwillingly heroine. But she finds herself with a strong cast including:Josh Brolin, Michael Biehn, Marley Shelton, Jeff Fahey, Naveen Andrews, Michael Parks, Fergie Ferguson and Tom Savini. Filmmaker:Quentin Tarantino appears in a hilarious bit part. This is also Rodgriguez's most entertaining schlock movie since ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". Which Tarantino wrote that film as well and appearing in a supporting role. In ""Planet Terror"", Rodriguez also produced, co-edited, co-compose the music score, photographed and his own chef as well. Panavision.Before ""Planet Terror"" starts... a fake action-packed trailer appears, written and directed by Rodriguez titled ""Machete"". Starring Danny Trejo, Jeff Fahey and Cheech Marin.""Death Proof"" is Written and Directed by Quentin Tarantino (Jackie Brown, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction). Tarantino's film is loving tribute to movies likes ""Dirty Mary Crazy Larry"", ""Duel"" and ""Vanishing Point"". Kurt Russell is perfectly cast in the lead. Russell offers one of his best roles in years. The female cast are terrific, including:Vanessa Ferlito, Jordon Ladd, Sydney Poitier, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Rose McGowan. Filmmakers:Quentin Tarantino and Eli Roth (Cabin Fever, Hostel part 1 and 2) appears in small roles. Tarantino's movie offers strong dialogue and one of the most, wildest car chase in a while. Tarantino's picture is also old-fashioned as well. Michael Parks, James Parks and Marley Shelton appears in cameos. Tarantino also produced and he nicely photographed the film as well. Panavision.Before ""Death Proof"" starts, three fake trailers are featured. ""Werewolf Woman of the SS""-A parody of the infamous 1970's S&M films, written and directed by Rob Zombie. ""Don't""-a haunted house styled, written and directed by Edgar Wright. ""Thanksgiving""-a hilarious slasher spoof, co-written and directed by Eli Roth.These two features are clever, funny, gory and exciting but sadly these movie didn't played well at the box office, despite strong reviews by the critics. Most countries are going to release these films separately due of poor box office run in the United States­. These movies are instant cult classics and they will be extremely popular, once they are released on DVD. Rodriguez and Tarantino will expand their feature films on DVD. No doubt, they will put the missing reels back in their pictures. Definitely it was a nice try to put new movies as double-feature but ultimately failed sadly... But Don't miss your chance to see it in the Big Screen before it is too late. Both films (**** 1/2 out of *****).",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pure pleasure,"By far the most enjoyable Robert Rodriguez movie I've ever seen, ""Planet Terror"" succeeds mostly because the actors and the director have a grand time and because the ironic distance is kept to a minimum. In fact, the affection, respect even, that the filmmakers have for the genre registers in every frame, and that's evident in the fake trailers and the missing reel stunts. They are trying to recreate, not just a type of film, but the whole experience of watching one. For the most part, they succeed. Tarantino's half of this project, Death Proof, on the other hand, is a mixed bag. He's evidently got too big an ego to just get out of the way. As a result, his ""auteurist"" marks are all over the least successful parts of the film, and the most boring. The best bits are the most generic. (His use of Kurt Russell is brilliant though.) As a whole, Grindhouse is very funny, clever, quite gory and rarely boring. This is what Troma Team has been trying to do, and mostly failing, for the last 20 years.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rodriguez and Tarantino are firing on all cylinders with this one,"I have been waiting for Grindhouse for about 3 months now. Well today was the day I finally got to see it.I have to say this film is amazing. However it will not please casual film goers. This is not the kind of thing everyone will get or enjoy. This is for fans that LOVE the culture of film and cinema in all it's forms Even I am just a tad young to really appreciate what 70's Grindhouse pictures were, but after seeing Planet Terror it's hit all the points nicely. Bloody, funny, and very well done at not being well done. I really enjoyed the scratches and pops that came with it. Felt like I was at a revival house watching a print that was run over and over.What really pisses me off is everyone crapping all over ""Death Proof"", Quentin Tarantino's, portion of the film. I thought the dialog, although was a bit wordy in parts, really added depth to the female characters. Keep in mind I disliked Kill Bill vol 2 for the reasons people don't think this. KB2 was wordy and pointless. Death Proof is paced just right to make you appreciate what is happening when it happens. It also helps that the entire 3rd act is one long (and totally AWESOME) car chase, and has ending that will satisfy even the most bitter of critics. What was lacking with Death Proof were the pops and scratches that made Planet Terror so fun. Death Proof was to clean. Which also brings up the fact this is a film to be seen in theaters, I am not sure it will be as fun at home on DVD.Both directors really showcased why they are to me the Spielberg and Lucas for a new generation, putting a twist on genre films that they loved growing up. Hats off to both Tarantino and Rodriguez I paid 10.75 to see this, and I have to say it was some of the best money I have spend at the theater in awhile. It took 30 minutes just to stop smiling. It was just a great time. I hated 300 and have been bored with a lot of other films lately. If you are a film fan round up the guys and check it out. If you are looking for something that is going to solve the worlds problems you'd better look elsewhere. Oh yeah make sure you go with the guys, most girls are going to care less about this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not Your Average Daily ""GRIND""...","Now this was not a $70 million dollar box office barnburner as The Weinstein Company hoped it would be, and I don't know that they should be all that disappointed that it wasn't. Maybe Quentin and Robert never intended it to be. Guess nobody thought about that, did they? I think you have to be of a certain age to really, truly get into this double-header, and since I am, the coolest thing of all about GRINDHOUSE is that it feels like it was made just for me. I didn't see all that much drive-in action when I was coming up, but my neck of the woods in D.C. had more than its share of grindhouses, and did I fritter away a lot of my youth there or what? That precious time I spent made me the slobbering, slavering, mouth- frothing-wild-eyed horror/sci-fi junkie that I am today, and I wouldn't trade that education for anything in the world.I really liked all of RR's PLANET TERROR. It's so over-the-top splatterific, that as one of my friends pointed out, it's nearly a parody of a grindhouse film. QT's DEATH PROOF is like an Italian 'giallo' film given a hot beef injection of high-octane, muscle-car madness. Only problem is that you will either love or hate the first half-hour or so, which is almost completely nothing but character interaction between the nearly all-female cast. But I loved, loved, LOVED the second half! DEATH PROOF has one of the best car chases of this decade, if not THE best. Think I'm wrong? See it for yourself, then compare it to anything you've seen since 2000. Nothing can touch it. I stand by that statement 100%.Things I Dug The Most About GRINDHOUSE, in no particular order:MACHETE - Danny Trejo finally gets his real props, and I hope RR DOES make this one into a ""real"" movie.THANKSGIVING - Before Eli Roth makes one more movie, he should watch his own trailer again and remember why this is the SICKEST idea in the world! And I mean that in a good way...DON'T - Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg know all about what made those Seventies British horror sagas so cheesy, screamy good, and he makes sure to stick the references all through here. EXCELLENT job.WEREWOLF WOMEN OF THE S.S. - Best trailer for out-and-out laughs and execution, but the one that would most likely suck ass as a 'real' movie. But you gotta give Rob Zombie props for pulling out Sybil Danning. (Where the hell has SHE been???)CASTING FOR PLANET TERROR - This was one of the things that grindhouse movies were all about: the casting. Everybody did one helluva job, and I sure hope they all get more work from having done this gig, especially Michael Parks, Jeff Fahey, Michael Biehn, Josh Brolin, Marley Shelton, Freddy Rodriguez and Our Girl, Rose McGowan. And the guys at KNB had to be creaming themselves, for having finally gotten a huge internationally-known action star in their clutches. (I won't say who, but you already know him.)KNB Studios - You know Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero had multiple orgasms working on this flick.Tracy Thoms, Sydney Poitier, Vanessa Ferlito and Rosario Dawson - Just see DEATH PROOF and you'll know why.""The Crazy Babysitter Twins"" - Don't get me started!Zoe Bell - Coolest, ballsiest stunt-PERSON ever. KILL BILL would have been crapola without her, and now I know why. QT has to make a movie just for her now.Kurt Russell - His ""Stuntman Mike"" in DEATH PROOF may very well erase the memory of anything else he's ever done. And yes, that includes Jack Burton AND 'Snake' Plissken.RR's THEME FROM ""PLANET TERROR"" - Every strip club in America will be ripping this song off, and don't think it won't be sampled in more than a few rap tunes.Final tally: GRINDHOUSE as an overall experience gets a 3-out-of-4 stars. PLANET TERROR rates about a 3.8. The Trailers all together get a 3.5 (but THANKSGIVING by itself is a definite 4.) DEATH PROOF also gets a 4. The well-written but slow dialogue sequences keep it from getting an out-and-out 5, but that last half-hour or so pushes it just above its companion.(This is based mainly on the theatrical experience.

"Utterly typical, unbelievable, and predictable.","While I consider myself an avid movie fan, I did not enjoy this movie for several reasons.The pointless stupid little things thrown into the movie for what seemed to be no reason whatsoever (IE the strippers making out in the back room, the using a grenade launcher as a jet-pack, the fact that each of these friends in a seemingly small town just happened to be immune, the rude attitude of the sheriff toward the 'hero', the utterly stupid fact that somebody's genitals were dropping off in a midst of an attempted rape), that these same directors seem to do in A lot of their movies.It just makes me scoff, and makes me think that these directors are less mature than the children they hire for their parts.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Two movies for the price of one!,"My Take: Takes on Z-grade sleaze with style, panache and over-the-top glee, GRINDHOUSE is great night at the movies.I wasn't born when Grindhouse cinema was in fashion, yet judging by the terrific time I had with Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's GRINDHOUSE special, I guess I didn't have to. Bursting with the love and at the same time mockery of the directors to their inspiration, GRINDHOUSE is a wild ride, a fun and surprisingly original time at the movies. Anyone wanting to dust off some nostalgia will absolutely feel at home here. But even others only wanting a swell movie-going experience won't feel so alienated. Okay, so I didn't exactly see the actual full GRINDHOUSE double-feature, but I did see each film separately (now on DVD) and I manage to pick up the rest of the fake trailers myself on the internet, completing the Grindhouse experience.""The Fake Trailers"": In addition to two full mock-Grindhouse features, there are four fake trailers to add to the Grindhouse experience. They're authentic, yet self-mocking at the same time. And that's the treat. However, like the two features, there have their differences. Finally, I get to review a trailer (sort of) instead of simply including them in a review of some movies, saying they are sometimes better than the films they endorse.""Machete"": Robert Rodriguez's fake trailer comes first, ""endorsing"" a hit-man movie, the sort of hit-man flick now considered as curiosity pieces just because of their awfulness. Rodriguez knows that, so he picks Danny Trejo to play a Mexican assassin-for-hire who is framed, left for dead and now demands revenge. Rodriguez truly captures the feel of an old, sleazy 70's trailer (complete with the typical announcer) with a welcome sense of mockery. It's pretty violent of course, but starts becoming hilarious when Cheech Marin as a priest appears with a shotgun. A terrific take, but like most trailers to real bad movies, it's better left a trailer. Rating: ****.""Werewolf Women of the SS"": My favorite of the fake trailers, Rob Zombie's take on soft-porn exploitation films is often sick and sleazy on one hand, but has its share of hilarious mockery on the other, while having an authentic feel of the actual thing. Udo Kier is a welcome face as a Nazi officer (what else?!) and Nicolas Cage in a hilarious appearance as (I hope you're sitting down!) Fu Manchu! Who knew? Rating: ****1/2.""Don't"": The trio of one of my favorite funny men (director Edgar Wright and actors Simon Pegg and Nick Frost) bring what ironically is the spookiest of the four. Wright's take on B-haunted house movies is alternately funny and scary attempt, but the ""scare"" part seemed more evident to me. Nonetheless, Nick Frost makes a welcome (if pretty disturbing) cameo and Wright's mockery is still evident. But if you think this is the best of the fake trailers, don't!! Rating: ***.""Thanksgiving"": The worst of the trailers in my opinion. A sick, violent take on the slasher sub-genre by the one-and-only Eli Roth. His trademark gruesomeness is evident on-screen in a montage of one gruesome scene after another, presented in trailer form. I don't really know when this film stops being gross and starts not taking itself seriously. Though, he does capture the feel of the authentic trailers in was inspired from. That alone might inspire a small giggle, but then, in comes another stab with the knife! And don't get me started on how this thing ends! Rating: *.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Screw what everyone else thinks!,"I liked the ideas for both the films and fake trailers. Made it feel like a Grindhouse cinema. The only flaw, of course, was Tarantino's half. Yeah, it had great stunts and action, but that was like 30% of it. The rest was all chat. Rodriguez's half never bored me at all. Great action, bloody violence, great cast, good dialogue. Now, onto the fake trailers. MACHETE: The trailer was friggin' AWESOME! Nice to see Trejo become a leading character, great action scenes and film references. WEREWOLF WOMEN OF THE S.S.: This was good. Nice to see some old faces from Zombie's films(Sheri Moon, Ton Towles, and Bill Moseley). What threw me off track was a brief cameo of Nicholas Cage as Dr. Fu Manchu. THANKSGIVING: BEST SLASHER PARODY I'VE EVER SEEN! Eli and his buddies did a great job with this mock-trailer. Great story, great slasher film idea, good cast. Gave a good icing on the cake with music from Creepshow.Planet Terror: 5 out of 5 stars. Death Proof: 2 out of 5 stars.

You just don't see movies like these anymore.,"""Grindhouse"" has all the action and thrilling suspense of a real 70's style movie. Although the writing was not so great it was directed by two of the most modern directors of our time who bring plenty of action and has an amazing cast.Bruce Willis can very well be considered a veteran of acting and getting him to play the role in ""Planet Terror"" was just amazing given that the movie itself was not really good written. But thats just one of the many special qualities that makes it a grind house move. I think if you are a hardcore action fan you should definitely see it.

A Masterpiece,"I'm from the Netherlands and the film here is being split.But I had the chance of seeing it has a double feature during a trip to New York.I loved the film, a pure experience at the cinema, some people might think it is a guy film, but it is not, it is a film for everyone who loves movies.About the films.Planet Terror, my favorite : Pure Mayhem, so over the top, so outrageous that it is great. A homage to the old grind-house film, with loads of gore and action.Death Proof : Much Slower, I really didn't like it to much, I think Tarantino made an actual grind-house film instead of paying tribute to the genre, and that is the problem because grind-house films where bad films to begin with.Now the trailers.Machete : Great character played by Danny Trejo.Werewolf Women of the SS : My favorite, outrageous and in the vain of Isla she wolf of the SS Don't : Really funny Thanksgiving : Really looked like an old grind-house trailer.I think Grindhouse will go down in history has a cult favorite.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"10 Stars for Rodriguez, Roth, Winter, and Zombie.","Two feature films plus a handful of trailers for a three-hour extravaganza of entertainment sounds like a great idea, and it is. I loved the overall experience; the bad splices, the damaged prints, the old school ratings animations. That all worked. So did Robert Rodriguez's film, PLANET TERROR. This gore-infested zombie film is a real hoot. It stars ""Six Feet Under"" undertaker Freddy Rodríguez as ""El Wray,"" a man with a wrecker and a past. He encounters a luscious figure from his past at the local BBQ joint when he meets up with Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan), a Go-Go Dancer who once had a dream of being a doctor.PLANET TERROR is brimming with interesting characters who are certainly archetypes but fun archetypes. Two of my favorites include a craggy Michael Biehn as the crusty small town sheriff who's been on the outs with this brother, Jeff Fahey, for years over his secret bar-b-que recipe. Along with this familial conflict, there's political intrigue, medical drama, crazy babysitters, and blazing gunfights. The whole thing is set to an all-too-familiar score reminiscent of John Carpenter. In fact, quite a bit of the film plays like a Carpenter/Romero lovechild. Think ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 meets DAY OF THE DEAD.On the other end of the spectrum from this rip-roaring blast of action is the second feature of GRINDHOUSE, Quentin Tarantino's DEATH PROOF. Essentially, this film is comprised of dialog. It's one scene after another of two groups of girlfriends talking about a whole lot of nothing. It's basically a movie version ""The View"" with more pot, drinking, and swearing. Kurt Russell is also there as Stuntman Mike. He hangs out in the background for most of the film, only really having two scenes that count in this tedious and talky exercise that would make MY DINNER WITH ANDRE look like an actionfest.The script to DEATH PROOF explains far more than ended up on screen but neither version gives a whole lot of motivation for why Stuntman Mike terrorizes women with his tricked-out car. The movie of DEATH PROOF holds confusion here and even in its timeline. Knowing that director Tarantino likes to muck about with time (DEATH PROOF is set after PLANET TERROR), some have proposed that the second half of DEATH PROOF comes before the first half chronologically. This is done in an attempt to explain Stuntman Mike's scar, cool attitude, plastic car cage, and bloodlust. Otherwise, audiences are denied any of these and can't identify with anyone in the film, even its psychotic killer main character.Every film fan knows what they can expect from a Quentin Tarantino film: pop culture-laden dialog, backgrounds festooned with movie posters, other films' soundtracks on the soundtrack, and bare (women's) feet. DEATH PROOF has these in spades. However, this time Tarantino just doesn't seem to have either the formula right or perhaps the spark that typically brings it all to life. One would think that having this ample opportunity to pilfer and emulate classic exploitation films would have provided Tarantino with inspiration to make his grindhouse tale an unstoppable homage. Instead, he seems to have been shackled to ceaseless scenes of girls chatting.Sure, the girls chat about movies, too. They refer to VANISHING POINT, CANNONBALL RUN, DIRTY MARY CRAZY LARRY, GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS, and others (for more on these films see ""The Chase Is On from Cashiers du Cinemart #11) but DEATH PROOF comes nowhere near the excitement of any of these films. With no offense meant to David Lynch's film but THE STRAIGHT STORY moves faster than DEATH PROOF.Another odd thing about DEATH PROOF is the lack of ""print damage"" when compared to PLANET TERROR and the four fake previews. There's some minor mangling of the print near the beginning of the film but it quickly disappears, not to appear even around reel changes. There's one moment where the film utilizes a conceit that there's a reel missing from DEATH PROOF. This is done, apparently, only to avoid the awkward scene of Butterfly (Vanessa Ferlito) giving Stuntman Mike a lapdance. This same ""Reels Missing"" trick was used in PLANET TERROR as well, but used entirely differently. In Rodriguez's film the missing reel contains a wealth of action sequences that other characters elude to, effectively winking at the audience and counting on them to be smart enough to get the joke.In short, if you haven't seen GRINDHOUSE yet do yourself a favor and leave after the preview for Eli Roth's THANKSGIVING. By that point you've gotten all of the entertainment you're going to get our of GRINDHOUSE.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The most fun you'll have in the theater,"This movie not only succeeded my expectations....it smashed them. I never thought I'd put the words Grindhouse and best movie of the year in the same sentence, but here I am. Grindhouse is amazing. It's like an homage to the film nerds, who want something different, but mainstream. This bloody, sexy horror action movie is probably one of those flicks you shouldn't see with everyone, but isn't that what it's about? Planet Terror and Death Proof are perfect for each other. One, a manic bloody action flick with style and panache, and the other, a slower, tense thriller. I loved both of these movies,which almost perfectly complemented each other. How far did these guys push the MPAA? Pretty far if what I saw was any indication. This movie has plenty of violence, gore and blood. There is a lot of swearing (169 uses of f---!)and drug use. This movie pushes the mainstream buttons...but it's all done ghoulishly funny, and not to be taken seriously. This movie is the cinematic equivalent to a time machine. And fans of the directors will love this, since it shows off their amazing trademarks.Quention Tarantion and Robert Rodriguez have created something amazing. Congratulations.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Elevating exploitation flicks to an art-house level,"Let's be clear about this. Grindhouse is crap.. pure, utter, enjoyable crap that will leave you laughing heartily, clapping, and looking at your watch to see how much longer the pain will last. All of which is the intended result, meaning that the directorial and writing tandem of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino hit their mark in spectacular fashion.This is a movie where even the flaws are an homage to the genre of B-movie cinema trash, as much as is the gore, action, car chases, and crotch shots.Clocking in at a little over three hours, Grindhouse is not a movie for those unfamiliar with the cinematic trash that was the mainstay of 70s repertory houses, paying the bills for theater owners and allowing them to schedule less profitable, higher class foreign imports by directors such as Ingmar Bergman.Complete with deliberate continuity gaffs, dialog that alternates between the horrendously mundane and momentarily brilliant (which must have been a stretch for the normally sharp-penned Tarantino who is known for his snappy dialog), and ""missing reels"" jumping their respective film's story lines forward some 20 minutes in a second, Grindhouse has been designed from the ground up to entertain the B-movie-violence-loving film geek and test the patience of anyone else who doesn't fall into that category.For those not in the know, Grindhouse consists of two separate movies, both with different leads but the same group of supporting actors, with bogus trailers prefacing each.The first half, the Rodriguez-directed Planet Terror, tells the story of a chemical outbreak that turns the inhabitants of a remote Texas dust hole into flesh eating zombies, further spreading the contagion with each non-lethal bite. It features the scantily clad Rose McGowan as a stripper turned machine-gun-legged killing machine (don't ask, just go with it), and delivers the sardonic pleasure of watching Stacy Ferguson of the Black-Eyed Peas being turned into zombie lunch. The second installment, Death Proof, features Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike, the surprisingly suave yet chickenshit psycho who drives a black, structurally fortified, 1971 Chevy Nova and bites off more than he can chew when he encounters Kiwi stunt-woman Zoe Bell (playing herself) and three girlfriends out for a ""joyride"" in a white 1970 Dodge Challenger.The latter film, which suffers deliberately from extended dialog scenes that serve as much to agonize the viewer as they do to provide plot info, is the superior of the two in that zombie movies are a dime a dozen, while tributes to gearhead films such as Richard C. Sarafian's 1971 film ""Vanishing Point"" are few and far between. Once Tarantino gets his fill torturing the viewer with his chatty roadhouse and diner sequences, and the film hits the open road, that's when things really start to ""shake and bake"". Like a nitro-fueled funny car, Death Proof delivers the goods in a white knuckle sequence in which Bell actually performed her own outrageously insane stunts  a sequence that will impart tremendous respect for the profession of stuntman/woman.There was a time when B-movies were just that, exploitive cinematic crap that many of us loved for their unabashed no-holds-barred festival of nudity, gore and violence. The genre can now thank Tarantino and Rodriquez for elevating it to the level of art film.Russ Meyer must be rolling over in his grave with joy.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

spectacular double feature,"A masterpiece. from the 2 of the smartest filmmakers: Tarrantino and Rodguiez. they do a fantastic job of bringing back exploitation films of the 70's and 80's. once it starts with the outrageous over the top ""Machete"" trailer you know you are in for a ride. its 2 movies for the price of one,and there is hilarious fake trailers and old commericals in between. The first film is Rodguiez's ""Planet Terror"", a crazy gore fest zombie movie. It is hilarious and is so so so over the top with Rose Mcgowan as a go go dancer whose leg is chewed off by zombies, so she becomes a fighting machine, and attaches a machine gun to her leg, a crazy sight to see. Tarrantino makes an appearance as a rapist guard who turns into a zombie. After that there is two hilarious trailers: Eli Roth's bloody holiday horror ""Thanksgiving"", and Rob Zombie's ""Werewolf Women of the S.S"". Then its Tarrantino's film,""death proof"", an action packed car chase movie. It starts out slow,then leads to a jaw dropping car wreck sequence. Kurt Russel stars a murderer who kills off hot teens with his car. It features one of the most crazy,unbelievable, best car chases ever in a movie. the end is so entertaining it'll make you cheer.

"Go for the experience, stay for the fun.","The only reason I gave this movie (movies) a 9 out of 10 was because of Death Proof.

There were some really funny (at least to me) technically wrong things about the movie that add to the experience, but overall, the movie was a little of a letdown. Planet Terror on the other hand was quite good. I would almost consider seeing this movie on it's own, as long as I knew it was making fun of itself. It was a great ride and one of RR's best works. I have a hard time watching RR's work cause he usually does the writing and he's not the best writer, but this one really worked for him.

Even Russ Meyer would hate this.,"As we talk about two separate movies I would say a few words about Rodriguez's part, the Planet Terror. That piece could be rather entertaining. That is an interesting attempt to make a horror movie, which is self ironic, funny, but meant to scare the crap out of you. You can feel the attempt, but that is less than enough, it is not funny as a parody, not scary as a real horror movie, and have a cameo appearance of Tarantino (wich is an other weakness). But the jokes are fine, you could never guess, how useful is the M16 as a prosthesis, and Rodriguez uses all of the clichés of horror movies to emphasize the satirical effort. Close, but no cigar.And here is the hardest part. Deathproof. First of all, I got the concept. I know that it meant to be some kind of homage to Russ Meyer, not breaking the bonds of the genre. I know that Tarantino really really loves the crap movies. It is shown via the fake trailers, the oldschool 70's visual effects and so. We got the message. But the Deatproof is not the most advanced part of the evolution of the sexploitation movies, it's not even original, there is nothing new on it, it is a dead end. Like Quentin have learned nothing about them, he's not synthesizing, just copying the existing ones and does it without any sign of being talented or any attempt to be unique. The movie only contains boring conversations of different girls, an antihero without the slightest reason to be there, and a predictable ending. Nothing for your brains to work on and nothing for your eyes as well. (The only nicely photographed part is about some flying limbs, that looks fine) It is a movie, inspired by some unique, some really important and some really crap movies. Shame that there is nothing original and enjoyable about it. It's a film made by a director to his very own entertainment of his very own taste (which taste determines the result) It is not my job to tell, why are there so many users who appreciate that so much. I can only guess that they are in the Tarantino Bandwagon. Bad for them, they should get out at the next stop.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rodriguez knows....,"Being a huge Robert Rodriguez fan for more than ten years my expectations were high, I can damn well tell you that. After hearing the news about the split, my heart ached, but last night the long wait of at least a year and a half reached its end and I finally got to see the new film from Robert Rodriguez, ""Planet Terror."".......Oh my God....It was everything I hoped for and beyond the boundaries of my wildest dreams. I loved every little second of it! The movies pacing is like a madman and the characters are unbelievably 2 dimensional, but with heartwarming personalities. Nobody really has real dept, but the performances were so incredibly solid and fun to watch that it felt like every character was one of my favorites. I loved seeing Micheal Biehn and jeff Fahey! I loved seeing Josh Brolin and Bruce Willis! Tom Savini, Carlos Gallardo, Rose McOwen. And even though I first had my doubts about the casting of Freddy Rodriguez as a badass hero type, I loved the character of El Wray played by Freddy Rodriguez! He did a tremendous job and made a really memorable performance with this character. So did every one.The great thing about this movie is; being a zombie flick, it reaches us viewers quite late in the whole zombie-revival thing that was going on with the ""Dawn"" remake, Shaun of the dead and Land of the dead. So that's actually quite ballsy, coming up with yet another zombiemovie. Robert Rodriguez pulls it off to make you forget that there even was this entire zombierevival and creates a movie that is unique within the ""genre"". Actually the man has his own genre and even in his genre it's quite unique. He makes a Robert Rodriguez flick with zombies... and a helluvalot more. See it.

An Unrivaled Movie-going Experience,"With countless remakes, sequels and rehashes seen at the movie theaters in recent years, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's ""Grindhouse"", an over the top double feature, is a very refreshing movie going experience that actually warrants a ten to twelve dollar admission fee. With two suspenseful full length feature films and several hilarious fake trailers in between, this movie is guaranteed to satisfy both the nostalgic fan boys of 1970's and '80's grind house theatergoing experience as well as anyone who is up for some non-stop entertainment that manages to keep audiences intrigued even with an over three hour running time.Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" is the first of the two films and starts the grind house experience off incredibly. This zombie movie is a violent, laugh filled saga about a town that becomes overrun with contaminated, undead humans. The film never takes itself too seriously, as unbelievable plot lines are necessary in creating Rodriguez's almost spoof-like experience of 70's and 80's horror movies, with missing reels and all. A main character with an automatic machine gun for a leg would seem ridiculous at first, yet is surprisingly cool, unique and funny.The gore, action and humor of ""Planet Terror"" is followed up by Tarantino's ""Death Proof"", an intelligent slasher flick where the murderer uses his car instead of a knife. A huge change from the previous film, this one is all about suspense and anticipation, riddled with witty, clever dialogue that is humorous and entertaining. The car stunts throughout this portion of ""Grindhouse"" are done completely without CGI and will make your jaw drop because of how impressive they are.While both story lines differ substantially, the overall feel of each separate film remains the same. The prestigious directors actually went as far as to ""age"" the films by adding scratches, dirt and dust, which creates a movie viewing experience unique to any other seen in past years. Tarantino and Rodriguez's faithfulness to the late 1970 grind house theaters is remarkably enjoyable and so different from any other type of movie which has been released recently that the intentional B-movie scripts are overlooked.The fake movie trailers in between the ""Planet Terror"" and ""Death Proof"" are brilliantly made, spoofing the way trailers use to be thirty years ago, and do so with such hilarity. Also created by famous horror directors such as Rob Zombie, Eli Roth and Edgar Wright, trailers for the ""Thanksgiving"", ""Don't"", ""Machete"" and ""Werewolf Women of the S.S."" are purposely vulgar and ridiculous in order to have audiences laughing the entire time they preview what is suppose to be an actual movie.It has been an incredibly long time since a movie has been released that manages to escape every set genre of film and create its own personal identity. ""Grindhouse"" does this by not only being two horror movies in one, but also by never taking itself too seriously and incorporating such unique elements as missing reels and fake trailers. This underrated, over the top double features is truly something to behold, and most definitely worth the price of an admission ticket.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
grindhouse speaks for itself,"You must be kidding! The only reason this thing (movie) is getting all the press, is Quentin Tarantino's name is tagged to it. The previews and cable networks pushing the movie for all its worth. The previews alone ( as is the norm for bad movies )are all that you get, so enjoy it. A one legged flying purple people eater captain Ahab clunking on the deck with a m-16/m-79 grenade launcher extension. Raunch to ballet dark and ominous. Lions and tigers and bears, oh my! You may as well go out and play on the freeway, you will certainly have more fun than wasting your fare and sitting in the dark watching a bad comic book trying to come to life. Other than that, it will most certainly be a hit for the blood and gore group. (Mini guns on motorcycles) almost forgot that one. So when the raves come in, remember the age group who vote on this thing, barely legal to drink. Have fun.Dan Cooley",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie is F***ING COOL!,"""Grindhouse"" is a tribute to the old theater with two movies and a few faux trailers. The first movie is ""Planet Terror,"" which is directed by Robert Rodriguez (Sin City), about a group of people trying to defeat some zombies who were infected by a disease called DC-2. This stars Freddy Rodriguez, Rose McGowan, Josh Brolin, and Bruce Willis.The second movie is called ""Death Proof,"" which is directed by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), about a misogynistic sociopath named Stuntman Mike who kills women with a car as opposed to a gun or knife. But when he messes with the wrong group of gals, that's where things really start to get fun. This movie stars Kurt Russell, Vanessa Ferlito, Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms, and Rose McGowanThis movie was, (and I quote from ""Planet Terror"") F***ING COOL! It's violent, it's gory, it's everything you hope for in a movie where exploitation is a must. I especially like the aging effects that were used to make this movie look like it was made in the 70s. It was awesome! Plus, the ending of ""Death Proof"" was great! I won't tell you what happens, because you'll have to see it yourself, but it's great!Oh, yeah, I forgot! The faux trailers! The faux trailers are messed up beyond recognition. The first one that you see is for ""Machete."" The second is for a Nazi-movie about werewolves, which is directed by Rob Zombie. The third is for a movie called ""Don't!,"" which is directed by Edgar Wright of ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" fame, and finally the fourth, and probably the most messed up one of the bunch is ""Thanksgiving,"" which is directed by Eli Roth of ""Hostel"" fame. You'll have to see them to see why ""Thanksgiving"" is the most messed up of the bunch.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie is AWESOME!!!,"I have been waiting to see this movie since January and i was so excited that it came out. i went to the first showing at our theater and i was blown away. i loved it so much. Those previews in between the movies were so funny and cool. I loved Planet Terror. It had so much action and gore. i was amazed. Death Proof wasn't as good as Plaent Terror. It had to much talking and not as much action. It was still good though. Kurt Russel was awesome as Stuntman Mike. Plus all those girls were very hot so that was good. Anyways, i love this movie and you should definitely see this. I will see this again for sure. The action was great, the dialoge was awesome, the gore was fascinating, this has everything a good movie needs. so go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Good!!!,"What can I say I enjoyed this movie. I didn't get a chance to see it when it originally came out, but there's a theater that only cost $1.00 here so I figured I'd check it out. I knew it didn't do well at the box office and I wondered why. It was very good and original I think. Both directors did a good job but I think it went over people's head. These movies are for entertainment only; I think people were expecting something serious. And the trailers before and in between the movies were hilarious; especially the ""Thanksgiving"" trailer. I thought I was gonna die laughing. I would have gave this movie a 9 or maybe more but that hood-rat ghetto chick in ""Death Proof"" really got on my nerves. She added nothing to the movie except hood language and attitude. But other than that great film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"One of the Best, if not the Best Movie I've ever seen...","Grindhouse is simply amazing. I laughed, I gagged, I squirmed all the way through this AWESOME double feature. The cast & crew should be really proud of this, as it really stands as a ballsy, dirty trip back to the 70's. Anyone who hasn't seen this, I strongly, STRONGLY recommend it. Even if you cannot see Grindhouse together as a whole, you should still check it out. So forget your Citizen Kane's and your Battleship Potemkin's, GRINDHOUSE is where it's at.PLANET TERROR - 10/10 DEATH PROOF - 9/10 DON'T - 8/10 THANKSGIVING - 10/10 WEREWOLF WOMEN OF THE SS - 8/10 MACHETE - 8/10 AS A WHOLE MESHED EXPERIENCE - 10/10.Welcome to the Grindhouse.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fantastic movie,"The best time I've had at a movie. The complete attention to detail was unlike any I've seen before. I expected the movies to be short films that totaled about 2 hours of movie time, but I was in for a welcome surprise when I learned that both films are full length features. It was completely worth the four hours though! Both film-makers deliver good old fashioned gory fun. The movies are simultaneously retro and very current, but all around fun to watch. Neither movie overwhelms the other thanks to great attention to detail from both directors. These movies made my heart race, and they also made me laugh. I would recommend these films to anyone with a passion for 70's horror films, as well as anyone just looking for something different.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Explosive,"Tarantino and Rodriguez have brought back the true meaning to a double feature. This explosive Grindhouse feature packs action, gore and profanity.The first segment is Planet Terror, a hilarious zombie action flick loaded with guns, hilarious zombie violence and a great soundtrack. With distinctive characters like Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan), the Go-Go Dancer packed with useless talents (and yes, the machine-gun leg). Definitely see this one. 10/10!!! The second film ""Death Proof"" is directed by Quentin Tarantino and tells the tale of Stuntman Mike. The super bad-ass villain chasing girls in his ""death proof"" car. The film has a super-long car chase and a grisly scene. Worth your money + time. 9.5/10!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Grindhouse is in a league all it's own...,"When it comes to having a great time at the movies, it really does not get better than this. Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez have come together to deliver an outstanding homage to the movies they love and are inspired by.If you were not aware already, Grindhouse is a double feature. The first film is ""Planet Terror"" directed by Rodriquez, the second, ""Death Proof"" directed by Tarantino. Also, before and after the films, Grindhouse features a few fake trailers by some notable directing talents (such as Rob Zombie and Eli Roth).""Death Proof"" and ""Planet Terror"" are great for entirely different reasons.In the case of ""Terror"", the film never really takes itself seriously. This movie is just plain fun. Gory zombie action, wonderfully cheesy dialogue, and sexuality (though not as much as you might think). It also features a couple of memorable cameos such as Bruce Willis, Stacy Ferguson (""Fergie"" from the black-eyed peas), and, as you might expect, Quentin Tarantino. Don't expect to see a well-developed story or deep characters in this one, but sit back and enjoy the ride.""Death Proof"" is a completely different story. Tarantino takes a more serious approach in his film-making. Instead of going for over-the-top shock tactics, ""Proof"" focuses more on finely tuned dialogue and character development. But make no mistake, Quentin hasn't forgotten what Grindhouse is all about. In the final minutes, the action comes fast and hard with expertly crafted car chases. One final note: Kurt Russell is outstanding in this.So as you see, these movies compliment each other very nicely. And with all the great fake trailers added in, you could definitely do worse on a Friday night.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Death Proof,"It's ladies night and the feeling's right... for Stuntman Mike. After encountering a group of girls at the local tavern, he decides to have his way with them. And not in the way you might think. The second half repeats the event with another group of girls, only this time things go decidedly different.I loved this film. I didn't see it in the theater, but I saw the extended cut on DVD. So I can't speak for the differences other than that I know the lap dance scene is longer and they added in the toe-licking scene, both of which are great. Many people, including my horror buddy Jason, told me this film was slow and Tarantino had lost his edge. And yeah, it was slow, but I think this worked -- it probably seemed worse in theater because it followed the non-stop bull ride of ""Planet Terror"".The dialog is not Tarantino's best, but it's not bad. There's no quotables like the ""royale with cheese"" or pretty much the entire script of ""Reservoir Dogs"". But he makes the mundane, everyday conversation seem like something worth watching. And he knows how to write them. Compare this conversation (the one by the first group of girls) to conversations in other films, and you can't tell me that this wasn't more realistic. So, that's a pretty good job.For those who wanted gore, thinking this was a horror film, you probably were disappointed. Sure, there's some really good blood in the car crash scene (and even a face getting ripped off by a tire) but it happens in under 30 seconds, so you really have to keep your expectations low if you want gore. Me, I didn't mind. The suspense of the story was all I needed to keep me waiting to see what Mike was going to do next. He was a weird guy, both maniacal and calculated.Tarantino, or whoever did the casting, knew what hey were doing. The first group of girls was just alright, but since we wanted them to die it was okay we didn't find them as attractive. But in the second group, we have Rosario Dawson (whom I don't generally like, but was okay here) and the love of my life, Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Actually, the love of my life is Mandy Moore, but Winstead is the best horror has to offer. That cheerleader outfit was divine.Also, I loved the soundtrack. Tarantino is great at exposing viewers to 1970s music they've long since forgotten or never even heard of. The Coasters ""Down in Mexico"", April March's ""Chick Habit"" and the thumping ""Hold Tight"" are just stellar. Sure ,he could throw in some modern pop or rock songs, get a soundtrack that sells millions. But why? He's mining gold right here. Just as he's done on ""Kill Bill"" and all films before. He made ""Stuck in the Middle With You"" a bigger hit than it ever was the first time out.Some have complained it's too self-referential, with the subtle in-jokes about the other movies, including Texas Ranger McGraw, the Vipers outfit, the ""tasty beverage"" and more. Screw the critics. Self-referencing, or any referencing at all, makes a solid film. It's that subtlety that pays off for the alert and insightful that really drives a film home. Kevin Smith, who I think has a lot in common with Tarantino, is very self-referential. And you know what? It makes his films gold because you won't catch all the connections your first time.Let's list off the amazing cast: Kurt Russell (Stuntman Mike), Rosario Dawson, Jordan Ladd, Rose McGowan (who is much hotter as a brunette and a former love of mine, but I'll take her as a blonde), Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Zoe Bell (Uma Thurman's real-life stunt double, and Quentin Tarantino as Warren the Bartender. Priceless.If this film bored you in theater, give it another chance. I think the extended edition really adds some missing flavor. Sure ,you're not getting the sex and gore and non-stop thrills, but there's something about this film that really captures the style it was shooting for (the style of ""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry"") in a Tarantino vein. I think it kicks a llama's butt.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Death Proof,"Death Proof is very typical Tarantino. It has a 'From Dusk till Dawn' pace to it. IMO, I think Tarantino wanted to make a movie using stunt people as main characters. He took some stunt people who aren't typically a main character themselves and ironically made the movie about them, thus the stunt scenes have no stunt doubles and they CAN act.As for the story, imagine the opening restaurant scene from Reservoir Dogs, but for 45 minutes,'F-bombs' fly every 3 seconds...and it's not quite as entertaining...then the flick begins. If you were somehow able to not drift and payed attention to that first 45 minutes of dialogue and background characters, you will be able to pick out a few connections towards the motivation and results of the rest of the film.The chicks in the film are dirty hot, the death scenes are Tarantino extreme and the car chase at the end makes the movie ENTIRELY worth it!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The second viewing helped me to appreciate ""Deathproof"" more. I'm left waiting to see ""Machete"", Don't"", ""Thanksgiving"" and ""Werewolf Women of the SS"". Where can you find food like the Acuna Boys - who also rated an honorable mention in Kill Bill.Is the name of the band in ""Deathproof"" that is continually mispronounced a deliberate mistake - or a mistake mistake?

Where was this all my life?,"Yes, this movie was in theaters! If you're like me though, that's news to you. After seeing the trailer on DVD, I only vaguely remember seeing it at some bad horror movie months before it came out. The marketing on Grindhouse was pretty awful to say the least. This movie would have been a huge hit if anyone had actually seen it! I didn't find out about it until after it was split up on DVD. I was listening to an episode of this podcast at doublefeatureshow.com and they were talking about how ridiculous the split was. I said to myself, a modern double feature? I'm there! I actually went out and bought both DVDs so I could watch them back to back as they're meant to be seen. It was only later that I discovered there were trailers too! Only one trailer was released on DVD, so I missed out on three (or four included hobo with a shotgun) that still aren't available. Come on Dimension, get to work on this!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wasn't that some crazy b.s.?,"""Grindhouse,"" as some of us have only recently learned, is a slang term for a now vanished kind of down-market movie theater that showed double features of B-pictures. Tarantino and Rodriguez have produced a long portmanteau of a grindhouse homage movie that's a double blast. Rodriguez gets the cheap effects down, including the missing reels and scratched up stock and poor continuity and over-the-top gore, while Tarantino better captures the kind of simple, crazy fun such movies used to provide. Rodirguez's Planet Terror anthologizes crap movie styles and looks to perfection with its combination of sci-fi and zombie elements. But it's Tarantino's second feature, a diptych of two stories about some ladies and a devilish stunt driver (Kurt Russell), that shows us what raucous, powerhouse pleasure such movies could provide.Rodriguez, who has produced his share of bad movies, may never have done anything better than Planet Terror, a gleefully energetic potpourri of needle stabbings, explosions, lopped limbs, and bubbling and pustulating faces from a bio-terrorist plague, with shootouts, barbecue recipe secrets, sheriffs, ghouls, and, famously, a lady (Rose McGowan) who loses a leg and has it replaced by a machine--gun. Rodriguez holds his hodgepodge together with a cadre of recurrent characters led by the surprisingly cool and charismatic Freddy Rodriguez as the heroic underdog gunman, ""El Wray""; but any lack of unity is okay because it's part of the evocation of a slapdash production whose parts don't fit together. And then there's the missing reel, which teasingly comes at the sexiest moment, as does a similar lacuna in Tarantino's Death Proof.Not only is Grindhouse a triumphant celebration of the fanboy nerdism, the videostore expertise that made Tarantino who he is; it's a way to share the fun, along the way weaving in a bevy of tasty babes that includes Jordan Ladd, Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Rose McGowan, Vanessa Ferlito, Tracie Thomas, Rosario Dawson, and Marley Shelton. As a couple of those names hint, this is naturally a compendium of cult allusions that will make Grindhouse fun for nouveau fanboys to scrutinize and trawl for years to come. Packed with these, and hilarious, are the fake trailers for movies that never were, ""Werewolf Women of the SS"", ""Thanksgiving"", ""Don't,"" and ""Machete"", with an appearance by Nicolas Cage as Fu Manchu in the Werewolf segment.In truth though its vividness engages, Planet Terror is ultimately a bit wearying. The real enjoyment comes in Death Proof, which celebrates Seventies hopped up American cars and the pre-CGI car battles with real vehicles and real ""dumb"" (but skilled and bold) stunt drivers driving them in real death-defying crashes and races -- but also features vintage Taranntino dialogue, with its familiar challenges, salty talk, and shaggy dog elements. (There's plenty of computer use in both segments, notably to produce the effect of broken and damaged film footage, but also by Rodriguez to fake damage to bodies and defiance of the laws of physics.) The two parts of Death Proof overlap, because Kurt Russell is in both of them as an aging but still feisty stunt driver. In the first half he seems nice but turns out to be super mean. In the second, he starts out full of jackrabbit menace and winds up brought to his knees by the ladies he chooses to molest automotively. The formula is familiar from other Tarantino movies: violent action interrupted by long passages of ornate but irresistible chatter. What's interesting is to see how consistent the mix is, yet how fresh it seems. The conversations between real-life New Zealand born stunt double Zoe Bell, Rosario Dawson, Marcy Harriell, and Sydney Tamiia Poitier has as much rhythm and zing as any Tarantino talk thus far. The writer-director surely is still writing dialogue actors love to play. Yes, I called it a formula. In this context what's more appropriate? It still works. ""Wasn't that some crazy b.s.?"" a young black man said to me enthusiastically as I walked out. It sure was.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Extremely good!,"Death Proof was really good, but you can't call it a Grindhouse movie. I don't think it is Quentin Tarantino's best movie, but hey, has Quentin Tarantino ever made a bad movie? I really liked the Stuntman Mike character and it was really fun to see Kurt Russel in a new movie instead of an old classic like The Thing. The ending was... Well... I won't spoil it, but either you love it or hate it, and I loved it! The special effects was really good and it was a really entertaining movie. If you haven't seen it, I suggest you see other Tarantino movies first like: Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill because you will notice things from those movies also including in Death Proof.Planet Terror was even better! I loved the zombie apocalypse theme in the movie and the extreme gore scenes just made the movie funny. The best character in this movie is no doubt Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan). She IS in fact hilarious. It was funny to also see Tom Savini back on the screen as a clumsy policeman. This movie is filled with though action scenes, graphic violence, hot babes, famous actors and a brilliant ending. Really worth watching! Must be Rodriguez' best movie ever.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
life's too short,"The trailers are the only good part of this movie. Planet Terror was watchable, but so are Sci-Fi channel movie originals.

Campbell was the star of ""Evil dead"" which is very similar to this film. Blood everywhere! Other than that, Grindhouse reminds me on an early project of Peter Jackson from 1987 called ""Bad taste"". This movie did not taste bad, it was weird and sick and bloody just in right way. Basically they put this two film together and got a winning combination. Freddy Rodriguez made an impressive acting such as Josh Brolin.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
An innovative touch on how we see movies...,"I am so happy. It's been a long, long time since I've seen a good movie. GrindHouse, to put it simply, was amazing.The first movie is one of the (if not THEE) best zombie movies ever. It packs an actual story line (hey remember those?), tonnes of action, gore and an odd ending to boot. It was fantastic.However, not the same could be said for the latter movie. Death Proof was pretty bad, not 'good' bad. It starts off with several characters and develops them for a good 20 minutes. Then, the said characters abandon the screen. Poof... OK? Soon later, another group of girls arrive. They are much more fleshed out but still don't seem to have a purpose. All the while, we are also tracking Kurt Russel's character. He too doesn't seem to have a point.There was no back story, no real 'kick ass' scene (aside from maybe two), nada. Fact, he seemed more like a deus ex machina for the most part.The girls then ensue in a very long car chase (amazingly done BTW). I had a problem with this one. I won't spoil anything, but why didn't they just brake!? Argh, I just cannot buy this ""can't think straight during a crisis"" BS anymore.Anywho, as long as you don't really pay attention to the first half of the second movie, you'll enjoy it.Also, the faux trailers rocked. Some of them -- most notably ""Thanksgiving"" -- should get made. Though, one trailer I had a problem with was Rob Zombie's take. It was just a huge blur of scenes.So despite a poorly done second half, GrindHouse is a fantastic movie. Just make sure you have the right attitude going into this -- it's supposed to be cheesy, mmk? 8.5 useless talent number 32s out of a possible 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of Rodriguez's best and one of Tarantino's weakest is still great,"I originally saw this in the theater and loved it! I was too young to have seen this sort of double feature this film is a loving homage to, but I did grow up watching a ton of these sorts of exploitation films on VHS, which re-watching this film brought back those video store memories. Maybe for a home video release of this double feature they should have added some cheesy Vestron Video opening and replaced the missing reels and burnouts with VHS tape splices and tracking errors. Or maybe that's another Rodriguez/Tarantino film for another day? I'd recently watched both of these films separately and gave ""Planet Terror"" ***** and ""Death Proof"" ***1/2. ""Gindhouse"" in it's original theatrical presentation as a double feature, complete with mock trailers for fictional movies, falls somewhere in between. Edgar Wright's ""Don't"" trailer is the best. It looks most like it was a real movie and has a hilariously coda at the end, but a close runner-up is Eli Roth's ""Thanksgiving"" as a very funny send up of holiday themed slasher films (i.e. ""Halloween,"" ""Mother's Day,"" ""April Fool's Day,"" ""Black Christmas,"" etc), but Rodriguez's ""Machete"" trailer and Rob Zombie's ""Werewolf Women of the SS"" are also hilarious send ups of various exploitation film sub-genres. I also greatly appreciated the faux grain in the ""Grindhouse"" version over the cleaned up individual releases. As to the merits of the two films on their own, see my previous individual reviews.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Go See this Film.,"If you are squeamish or do not appreciate campy then do not see this film. It is gory, offensive, and extremely violent.But it is also genius.If you are a true cinephile then you will appreciate this brilliant throwback to the campy exploitation films of yesteryears.""Planet Terror"" is action packed and will have you turning away quite a bit during some scenes, but you will finish the film with smiles. Rodriquez has you going from reel one (even though some reels are ""missing"") and does not stop. He takes quite a bit of poetic license. So don't expect to see anything believable.""Death Proof"" is an enormous change from the fast paced ""Planet Terror"" but Tarantino delivers what he does best: pop culture referencing monologues and intense story lines. It's up and down for the pace but at the end you're rewarded. Tarantino created a film molded exactly from the exploitation films of the 70s. It has minimal plot, hot women, and big action sequences.Neither film will come out as masterpieces as what we know them to be in today's cinema.They are masterpieces because they are highly entertaining but more importantly because they replicated a genre lost. And did it extremely well. Genius.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Did Me In (In A Good Way),"I am not that faint hearted, I managed through Pulp Fiction with only a few squeals, but ""Planet Terror"" just about did me in (in a good way).""Planet Terror"" follows a Go-Go dancer who wants to be a stand-up comedian. Her ex comes back to down in his Mega Truck and when zombies attack, it's all violent fun-and-games. The plot is simple- kill the zombies. But like in all great stories, it's souped up with machine guns, hot chicks and pretty amazing lines. Unlike Tarantino, Rodriguez is not all chatting and wit, he prefers to use the dialog to make fun of the old B-lists with lines such as (when Cherry's producer catches her crying during her dance), ""It's Go-Go, not Cry-Cry"".Personally, I loved this film. I cared about the characters, even if they were just stereo-types, which I think is the mark of a great director. To create characters for humor, yet have the audience see them for more and really empathize. The hero was badass and the heroine hotstuff. What more can you ask from a zombie flick?""Death Proof"" was, of course, the reason I came to the film, my friend has a slight obsession with Tarantino so there was no way we weren't seeing it. I wasn't disappointed, but, I have to admit, I wasn't awed, either. It was good, the action well worth waiting for, but it was just a Tarantino for me. It didn't make me love it like ""Planet Terror"" did.Basically, the story is of a man (Kurt Russell) who can't do his thing unless he kills several girls simultaneously. So he stalks, then kills with this ""Death Proof"" car. The characters, as always, were interesting and fully-formed. The plot was sound. It was just... well, judge for yourself, they were both great.And the previews were hilarious, my favorite being 'Werewolf Women of the S.S.' The movie was all-around fun. I give the Rodriguez a 9 and the Tarantino a 7. Good movie, if you're a fan of horror or action, see these films.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Leave after the intermission,"Robert Rodriguez' ""Planet Terror,"" the first half of the double-bill, is terrific: very campy, very funny, takes all the good parts of the old exploitation movies and uses them to its advantage. Lots of gore, gratuitous nudity, none of the actors seems to take it seriously and that makes it that much more enjoyable.The previews are well-done, especially Rob Zombie's ""Werewolf Girls of the SS"" and Rodriguez' ""Machete."" Eli Roth's ""Thanksgiving"" was a hoot.Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof,"" though, is awful: boring, extremely dialogue-heavy: it takes all the bad parts of the old exploitation movies and doesn't improve on them. I'm not a fan of QT's movies, have always thought he's just seen a lot of obscure stuff and steals the best parts, but ""Death Proof"" is almost unwatchable. Kurt Russell is appropriately creepy but his ""Stuntman Mike"" isn't the star, nor is his souped-up car; instead, the stars are the uninteresting women who are Mike's victims. Really, really awful. As good as ""Planet Terror"" is, ""Death Proof"" just sucked all the enjoyment I'd had previously during the movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Grindhouse A-Go-Go!,"As standalone movies, Planet Terror and Death Proof are great entertainment, the former a hilarious pastiche of zombie gore movies and the latter an ice cool swagger of hot chicks, fast cars and great dialogue. Watch the two movies together in the Grindhouse format as they were intended, and they're elevated to something very very special. Extremely different movies in terms of pace and style, they still complement each other brilliantly, Tarantino's slow burner the perfect comedown after Terror's giddy overkill.The pacing in the Grindhouse edits is much snappier too (although Death Proof has a couple of great scenes missing), and the custom trailers and pops and crackles make this a truly unique experience. Seek it out in a rowdy cinema for that authentic Grindhouse experience, and enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Grindhouse,"I want to watch this film over and over again. I saw this the opening night, at midnight and have seen it 3 times since. The exploitation, the sheer ridiculousness and the pure entertainment just made me enjoy this roller-coaster.I, personally, thought Robert Rodriquez's film was more entertaining. Tarantino's was purely talky and I felt lacked the initial burst of energy.I think the whole creative process behind the film just shows what amazingly innovative filmmakers Tarantino and Rodriquez are.Oh, and I cannot wait to see those trailers made into movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best cinematic experience I've had since...ever.,"I'd like to begin my review with a little explanation of the circumstances in which I happened to see Grindhouse. For most of you fine people on MoFo, Grindhouse has come and gone in theatres and is currently available on DVD, with Planet Terror and Death Proof probably released separately. No such luck for Australia, one of the countries where Grindhouse was divided up and released separately (as I recall, Planet Terror didn't even get a theatrical release, only just coming out on DVD). From what I gathered, Grindhouse proper was played briefly in a few theatres across the country but pretty much everyone missed it, your humble narrator included. Recently, a local theatre held a special offer  Grindhouse would be playing in its entirety (both movies back-to-back with mock trailers included) for one week only. Naturally, I jumped at the chance to watch it and got my ticket. I was not disappointed.The ""one-week"" circumstances were a brilliant addition to the atmosphere that made Grindhouse immensely enjoyable. Just like the days when films would ship from town to town a week at a time, these films could be properly appreciated by people who would like it. Nobody was going to walk off the street and treat it as an idle way to blow a couple of hours like any ordinary mindless movie. The entire audience at the showing I went to had, like me, bought their tickets a week in advance and had planned on quite simply enjoying a spot of gloriously over-the-top ""trash"" cinema. Countless laughs and the odd groan were had over the course of the three-hour running time. This is the kind of experience watching the DVD at home quite simply can't produce.What does this say about Grindhouse itself? Lots. Even though the film's quality (in every sense of the word) is debatable, there's no denying just how freaking enjoyable the whole thing is. The mood was set within the first few minutes with Rodriguez's trailer for Machete; three minutes' worth of Danny Trejo taking names and kicking ass. Everyone watching knew how ludicrous the trailer was, but they lapped it up anyway. Trashy, yes, but at least it's good trash. That leads onto the first ""feature presentation"", Planet Terror.I'm fond of citing Planet Terror as my favourite of Grindhouse's two halves. Maybe it's because I have a soft spot for zombie movies and John Carpenter movies, both of which receive ample homage in PT. Having seen the bulk of Rodriguez's filmography, I knew what I could expect  questionable plot and dialogue coupled with plenty of stunning special effects. That was certainly the case  granted, it's a zombie movie, I can accept substandard plot and dialogue. In Planet Terror's case both were actually fairly decent (or at least they weren't what I'd refer to as ""Transformers bad""). As for ""stunning special effects"", I can't argue. Rodriguez sides with effects group KNB for his own grotesque take on zombies  as bulbous, goo-spurting mutants that would make Peter Jackson proud. Other than that, Rodriguez's penchant for explosions and action shines through. Even the simple ""machine-gun leg"" in the film's third act managed to impress me a lot more than I expected.Even though the film ends on a somewhat happier note than I'd have liked, all in all Planet Terror was great, although its ""horror"" quality is debatable  like 2004's Dawn of the Dead remake, it's more like an action movie with zombies in it. Doesn't make it any less fun.Then come a few more fake trailers. I have to admit I think the fake trailer gimmick was pretty impressive, offering a brief glimpse into some shamelessly amusing pieces of trash. Seriously, I wonder if anyone would ever consider producing full-length versions of these movies. Anyway, my favourite of the bunch would have to be Eli Roth's trailer for slasher film Thanksgiving. What can I say? It manages to be both dark and funny, often at the same time.That leads to the second half, Tarantino's Death Proof. I might state that prior to seeing Grindhouse proper, I saw both halves in their extended DVD versions. Having said that, I do believe that the shorter versions used in Grindhouse are superior, especially in the case of Death Proof. Mainly because, quite honestly, Death Proof is fairly hard to sit through. After being charged on Planet Terror and a series of intense trailers, having to change gears and watch a movie that is one-third car chase and two-thirds girl talk is a bit too much of a jolt, so to speak. As such, when watched as part of Grindhouse, Death Proof feels slooooooow.At least, the first half does anyway. When you first watch Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell, giving a decent performance but nothing spectacular) change from amiable stuntman to psychotic stuntman, the movie gets ramped up a few notches. Then it gets pulled back down again as you get subjected to more girl talk, albeit actually interesting (maybe because of stuntwoman Zöe Bell, who steals the show with a thick Kiwi accent and a love of dangerous driving). Just when it begins to drag, along comes Death Proof's (and ostensibly Grindhouse's) climatic point, a twenty-minute car chase through the Tennessee countryside. It all comes to a conclusion that is quite honestly blunt and pretty predictable, but that doesn't deter the audience, who cheered and clapped the end of three hours' worth of so-bad-it's-excellent cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"In the name of all that is holy, avoid this disaster at all costs.","Save your money. Save three hours of your life. Avoid this train wreck at all costs.I was attracted by this movie's concept, and to it's credit, the scratchy film, fake trailers and intermission bumpers are well done and entertaining. I think Pulp Fiction was one of the greatest movies of all time but has Quentin Tarantino hasn't done anything worth a freakin' fig since? And Grindhouse? Tarantino's half isn't even a movie. It's a boring skit any hack could write in an hour: girls talk trash. Girls get into a car chase with a maniac. The cars get banged up. The maniac gets banged up. The girls don't.THE END If Quentin Tarantino is not the most boring movie maker currently working, I don't know who is. So lacking in even the most elemental skills of film making, his festering no-talent virus has even infected the usually reliable Robert Rodriquez, who turns in ""a trying so hard it's dead on arrival"" riff on seventies exploitation movies that only looks good by comparison with Tarantino's dreck that follows it.In the name of all that is holy, save your dimes and save your time.Can't help wondering if there's a way to start a petition for Quentin to lose his DGA card by popular demand.Q.T. has found a new bottom in a career death spiral that's agonizing to audiences everywhere who keep going to his boring ""concept"" movies hoping he has another Pulp Fiction in him. But, after seeing this disaster, I fear that is never to be. Sad as it is to say, as George Bush is to presidents, Quentin Tarantino is to film makers.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best movie experience ever!!!,"When i saw this movie, we were in the small theater in the back of the building. There were four people in the theater. Luckily, by the time the movie started, the small theater was about 3/4 full. This is a movie that you need to see in the theater with a good crowd. The crowd really helps and adds to the excitement.Now to the movie. Planet Terror was the absolute most exciting, best movie I think I have ever seen. There was so much violence, gore, language, and all that good stuff. The premise for the movie doesn't leave much room for a real plot, nor does it need one. However, Rodriguez somehow puts a plot in this movie that you actually care about and isn't completely stupid. Freddy Rodriguez and Rose McGowen are excellent in this movie, and I think this'll be the breakthrough role for Freddy. All-in-all, really great film.Planet Terror - 10/10 Next were the fake trailers. They were really stupid and corny, but that's the way they were supposed to be. They were all pretty funny, and I really enjoyed them.Trailers - 9/10 Finally was Death Proof. Everyone's saying it's a boring film. It starts off really boring, with a bunch of hot chicks yammering on about nothing that anybody cares about. But once we're introduced to Stuntman Mike (excellently played by Kurt Russell), the movie really picks up. It's a lot less violent than PT, but it is still very good. The ending was great, and there was an incredible car chase scene that really keeps you into it.Death Proof - 9/10 Total Movie - 10/10 I loved this movie, and it may be my favorite of all time. Definitely see it in theaters",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Culty fun,"If you like the 70's flicks that this is a parody of, then you'll love this movie. If you like Tarantino style films, you'll love it to. And if you just like sci-fi, horror, action, or thrills, you will adore as well. This movie has got is all - all in a tongue in cheek nod to the viewer.

best film all year,"without having seen or even knowing about most of the movies coming out this year, i can already tell you that Grindhouse will entertain you more. a double feature from Robert Rodriguez and Quintin Tarantino, and with almost no break in the action, a keen eye for what grindhouse cinema is all about, and more blood than one can handle, Grindhouse takes the cake.first (after a hilarious trailer for Machete) comes RR's ""Planet Terror,"" a non-stop fast-paced exploitation film set in a zombified Texas town. in Rose McGowen as a sexy go-go dancer who loses her leg. next is her crazy boyfriend who eventually straps on her famous gun-leg. they, along with a few other survivors, are against the whole town in stopping the spread of zombies before they infect the planet. very reminiscent of a Geroge A. Romero flick (pacing included), RR decides to take that concept and add as much blood, gore, and pus as possible. no one will come out of this without feeling even a little squeamish. 10/10.last (after more insanely funny trailers, including Rob Zombie's ""Werewolf Women of the S.S. and Eli Roth's delightfully disgusting ""Thanksgiving"") is QT's ""Death Proof,"" a carsploitation (i can make that word work) film. not nearly as fast-paced or engaging as its predecessor, one might think that QT had failed us. not quite. although the middle 30 minutes bored some people to sleep, the ending car-chase makes up for it, using real stunts instead of CGI. 8/10.the trailers get a 10/10 by the way.my personal opinion is that they should have switched the orders of the films, considering the fact that as an audience, we are extremely pumped up after the first film only to be led into a slower-paced, but still fun, movie. as i said before, nothing will even come close to the exhilaration you'll feel when watching this. it's the first, and probably only, time this year i can say i will see a movie again before it's out of theatres. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than I could have imagined,"I am typically more of a Tarantino fan, but I have to say Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror was the better movie. Death Proof seemed to drag on a little bit, but was still an awesome story. The car crash in Death Proof was probably the most visually pleasing part of the whole thing. Also, Kurt Russel gave the performance of his life. It was meant to be corny, but he hit it out of the park.This is not a movie for everyone to see. I'm not the type to get grossed out during movies, but there were several parts in GrindHouse that made me cringe. If you are a timid movie-goer then this is definitely not the movie for you.Even if you are not a fan of Tarantino/Rodriguez type movies, I would recommend seeing this movie just for the trailers. They were hilarious.Seeing this movie made me feel like I was back in the 70s. That's how I have always imagined movies were back then. Both directors did a great job of capturing the style of old horror movies, while using state of the art CGI and special effects to make all the gore look fantastic. The best of both worlds.Best movie I've seen in a while. 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Big Pile of Suck-ass,"Clearly, there is a propaganda conspiracy running amuck in regards to the idea of people walking out of this film. The official explanation is the fact people weren't savvy enough to pick up on the whole ""2 movies within a movie"" idea Tranatino and Rodriguez were trying to convey. I think it is something more simple: this movie just plain stunk.Once you dip through all of the pretentious irony, you realize the product you're watching is quite substandard. When the fake trailers for the real film are far more entertaining than the movie itself, then its pretty obvious that something was wrong in the film-making process. I think it was just the fact that no one could say no to Tarantino or Rodriguez, that no one had the guts to say ""This movie blows"" even with the supposed irony in check. Tarantino's career has somewhat been overrated, holding a very hit and miss mentality. Where Kill Bill I and Pulp Ficiton succeeded, KB 2, Jackie Brown and Reservoir Dogs all kind of flopped. Throw in his magnanimous Deathproof to the crummy pile.Rodriguez's Planet Terror did have some elements to it that were absolutely hilarious, but even then, it just felt like it was dragging. Rodriguez should have cut himself away from Tarantino and put more work into the faux-movie ""Machete"", which is based on a character he wrote in the Spy Kids franchises (though much nicer). It would have made a better grindhouse-style film than Planet Terror. Rodriguez will thankfully return to form in Sin City 2, but he needs to drop the dead weight and ego that is Tarantino. His career can be salvaged at this point.As for Deathproof, there's a reason why many people left this stinker. The car chases were fine, but we don't want to hear endless streams of mindless ""Lifetime"" style dialog when we could be witnessing some more carnage from Stuntman Mike. During my showing, half the theater left in the middle of this clunker, and they knew exactly what they were getting into. The ultimate betrayal was at the end, when Mike was revealed as more of a coward than a bloodthirsty maniac. That alone kind of takes away the whole idea of the Grindhouse movie. A bad guy with a conscience? This is just another example that Kill Bill I may be the last good movie we'll get out of Tarantino, and frankly, this is probably a shot in the arm for humanity. I've always complained we need to stop praising bad films, this is certainly one of them.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
More fun than a movie goer should have in one show,"I have read many of the comments on several sites and saw this with my teenage son last evening. Although many of the comments tend towards the Grindhouse genre, bottom line here is that the film is full of gratuitous violence (in Planet Terror) and humor, intense scenes and flat out fun watching actors enjoying themselves on screen. Kurt Russell is especially good turning on the charm and sociopathic behavior, at times, simultaneously. Unlike many professional reviews, we both enjoyed Death Proof more as it was tight and not as ""draggy"" as I have seen stated in many reviews. The dialogue is quite well thought out and Russell is flat out fun to watch in this film. Planet Terror is a kicking blood-fest with great acting as well. Since neither ""feature"" takes itself too seriously, it has the fun cheesy feel that the ""B"" films have without the assumption that the directors are trying hard to make a statement. Again, it is a real pleasure to see the actors having so much fun making the film. It makes the film eminently enjoyable. This is definitely for a more mature audience, however you leave the theater wishing it was a triple feature with one of the films you see a trailer for added, such as ""Machete"" or ""Don't"". Be forewarned, make sure you are prepared to sit for 195 minutes as you do not want to miss a thing.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Welcome to the Grindhouse,"This review will be separated into two halves. The first of witc h is a review of Robert Rodcrigueses Planet Terror.Planet Terror.Upon first inspection Planet Terror seems like one of those movies destined to join the pile marked ""so bad its good"" but even with that looming over it Planet Terror doesn't lose its cool. It's a Grindhouse flick so it's generally in poor quality but as a film it's utterly fantastic. A tasteless orgy of guns, girls and gore. What more can you ask for?Married doctors William and Dakota Block - Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men) and Marley Shelton ( Sin City) - find their graveyard shift inundated with townspeople ravaged by gangrenous sores and a suspiciously vacant look in their eyes. Among the wounded is Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan) a go-go dancer whose leg was ripped off during a roadside attack, and El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez), a mysterious drifter with a past. Cherry may be down on her luck but she hasn't danced her last number yet.As the virus turns the invalids into enraged aggressors, Cherry and El Wray lead a team of accidental warriors into the night hurtling towards a destiny that will leave millions infected, countless dead and luck few heading for the last safe corner of Planet Terror.Wacky as it may be, Planet Terror leaks with authenticity and humour. There no doubt its one of the most quotable films of the last year. And while Rodriquez is not quite as brilliant as Tarentino he does and admirable Job at making this film in his vision.Actors Rose McGowan, Marley Shelton and Josh Brolin are those who sine mostly and while Freddy Rodriguez is commonly referred to as the hero its McGowan who saves the day. Brolin is hilariously terrifying and Shelton clearly isn't afraid to get herself slapped around. The cast altogether look like their having a blast.So are undoubtedly the audience, this is the kind of film that the critics hate to admit they loved. Aside from me of course what with me looking forward to Grindhouse since the beginning of last year. Shame the n that us English audiences get both films split because it sunk at the American box office.Hopefully then the two masterful films will be reunited on their DVD release.Its soundtrack from director Robert Rodriquez who also happened to be the composer on Kill bill Volume 2 composes the main theme for this and to be perfect ally honest it's infectious. And while Planet Terror isn't quite up to the high standards of Quentin Tarentino Death Proof it still provides enough competition for Mr. Tarentino to get scared.Death Proof.It's a crying shame UK audiences didn't get the full Grindhouse experience. And all because of the Americans intolerance towards it. Fair enough if you're not into this kind of stuff it's hard to sit through a film devoted to talking and car crashes but look under the bonnet and you'll find a world of possibilities.The Characters of these 8 seemingly unlinked women brought together by one diabolical man played by the absolutely terrifying Kurt Russell. But even he can't provide as much character as these two groups of four women. The first the lesser interesting of them who are fortunately given less screen time than the other four. Though Sydney Tamiia Poitier provides much entertainment as a feisty girl looking for a good time. It's the second group is far more entertaining including an oddly good performance from Uma Thurman's stunt double of Kill Bill Zoe Bell cast ironically as playing herself in the movie. Rosario Dawson's subtle turn from concerned ""play it safe chick"" to badass who in the end has the final laugh.As for Russell not much can be said about his massively entertaining performance only that he will most likely be haunting your dreams for long after what with him being absolutely bloody terrifying. As for plot there isn't much to it. A simple guy kill girl film reminiscent of the 70's Grindhouse flicks. But in no way does its film underestimate women what with Massive role reversal 17 minutes before the end in which there is one of the most dazzling car chases in history. In witch our heroines get their chance at revenge upon the psycho killer with deadly consequence.Director Quentin Tarentino doesn't skip on the foreplay with most of the film being clogged with female chit chat and one interestingly choreographed lap dance.Another thing director Tarentino didn't skip on it the authenticity. This could honestly be shown at a Grindhouse what with the humours title change at the beginning. The title ""Thunderbolt"" flashes on screen only to be replaced by a grey added on reel correcting it. Or the jumpy tracking in with the voices sometimes doesn't go with the actors mouths. Truth be told this is a brilliant exploitation flick.Though one thing that dulls down ""Death Proofs"" appeal is the horrible Tarentino cameo that is utterly cringe worthy. Not nearly half as cringe worthy as when he appeared in the second half of Grindhouse Robert Rodriguez ""Planet Terror"" when he appeared as the comical ""Rapist 1"" there is nothing comical about his acting abilities however. Or the fact that even when he transformed into that horrible beasty his performance was still vile.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Making Violence Artistic Has Never Been So Entertaining,"If you have never watched a Robert Rodriguez or Quentin Tarantino movie you are truly missing out on some of the best movies in cinematic history. Robert Rodriguez having been the creator of the famed Mexico Trilogy and 2005's cinematic acclaim, Sin City team up with legendary director Quentin Tarantino (creator of Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and the Kill Bill) to recreate the 70s experience of a Grindhouse.A Grindhouse theater/movie was a theater that showed nonstop movies containing graphic violence, explicit sexuality, and much more mature thematic material. This idea, being what all of the Rodriguez and Tarantino movies are all about, was not hard to recreate for the duo, and in the process, they have created one of the best motion pictures of all time.Giving Grindhouse a 9/10 gives me the complete right to rave about it. The film runs clear over 3 hours with two full length movies, one directed by each. Rodriguez's film runs first (Planet Terror) starring Freddy Rodriguez, Rose McGowen, Marley Shelton, Josh Brolin, and Michael Biehn as different people living in a small Texas town that unfortunately gets taken over by brain eating zombies. Planet Terror (even though only being half of the full movie) is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. Bruce Willis and Naveen Andrews co-star.Tarantino's segment follows shortly after (Death Proff) starring Kurt Russel as Stuntman Mike, a serial killer, who uses his stunt car as his weapon and kills 20-something girls. Yes it's sick, but it's Tarantino. The doomed girls include: Sydney Tamiia Poitier (son of ""Mr. Tibbs) Rosario Dawson, Zoe Bell, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Tracie Thoms (just to name a few). The unfortunate part of this segment is that it starts off very slow with uncreative, very repetitive dialogue about nothing that soon puts you to sleep, only to be awoken by an extremely graphic car crash. The segment (and the film) however, ends with a bang with one of the best final 20 mins, chase sequence, car scene, etc. in the past 100+ years of film.Being a Rodriguez/Tarantino double feature you can basically fill in the blanks and no what to expect: violence, gore, language, and sex. Besides having two outstanding story lines and great acting, the film takes violence and gore to a new level making it symbolic and artistic. That right there, brings the film up. As the film comes to an end, the closing almost allows you to forget about the opening of Tarantino's part, but still, you can't. Therefore, 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Planet Terror-Awesome. Death Proof-Decent but has a great ending,"Rated R for Strong Violence/Gore,Language,Sexual Content,Some Nudity and Drug UseGrindhouse is Quentin Tarintino's and Robert Rodriguez's two films that played back to back theatrically to bring back the memories of the old Grindhouse movie theaters of the 1970's where two low budget features would play back to back for the price of one film.There were also trailers between each film.This was a flop at the box office and the two films entitled Planet Terror and Death Proof were released on DVD separately without the fake trailers.But the movie network played Grindhouse in its entirety yesterday.Both films along with the fake trailers for a total runtime of 3 hours and 10min.The film started with the fake trailer for a film called ""Machette"".The first film was Rodriguez's Planet Terror.I would say that Planet Terror is one of the greatest zombie films of all time.It is very gory,interesting and humorous.The film is about a man who releases this special gas which turns people into zombies.So now the remaining survivors must battle the zombies and stay alive.Basically the same plot as any other zombie film only this one is much more entertaining than the others.I would give Planet Terror a 10/10.Now there are a few fake trailers that play after Planet Terror ends.They are ""Werewolf Women Of The SS"" and ""Thanksgiving"".I cant remember what the other trailers were(if there were any others).The fake trailers are very funny and interesting.The second film is Quentin Tarintino's Death Proof.Now I did not like this one all that much.I usually love Tarintino films such as Pulp Fiction,Kill Bill,Reservoir Dogs.I have seen them all except for Jackie Brown.Death Proof wasn't all that bad, it was just fairly boring.Most of the film just shows women talking about random things while a mysterious man named Stuntman Mike and his ""Death Proof"" car try to kill them.Most of the film is fairly dialogue ridden, which I don't usually mind.I mean I enjoy dialogue-ridden films such as Zodiac,The Godfather,Gone With The Wind.But Death Proof was for the most part boring.There were some funny parts but the real highlight of the film is the ending.The ending is basically some four girls plotting revenge on stuntman mike and the scene where they get revenge on him is very interesting and entertaining.Overall Death Proof was mediocre but the ending was excellent.Overall, if you haven't seen Grindhouse, I suggest checking it out.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
dizzying and spectacular and passionate and great,"Take it from someone who has been watching crapola of a certain vintage for months and months - this movie knows of what it speaks. It doesn't speak it with complete fealty - Rodriguez's editing rhythms and camera moves are more early 80s, that is when he's not imposing the jump-cut rhythm of mangled prints to absolutely brilliant effect. It's like ballet, and it's exciting and hilarious. Tarantino's is more 'deep grindhouse' or 'the whole action' - OF COURSE the actors won't shut up, because this is the rhythm of the grindhouse. You have to be bored to cutesy tears for hours before you are rewarded with the spectacular car chase - and even though the boredom here has no thematic relevance whatsoever to the era, the structural message gets through and I think it's pretty brilliant and audacious - BECAUSE it's boring, is it all right for me to think that? Anyway we can hardly demand even more breathless excitement immediately after an hour of Rodriguez and! and! the trailers, oh my god. Thanksgiving.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Waste of Money, not just mine, the budget!","I am a filmmaker and I went with a filmmaker friend wanting to like this movie. We kind of liked Planet Terror, and hated Death Proof. It made us very sad to see that this is the state of movie making. Just very sad.Planet Terror isn't bad. But it isn't any better than the movies it is a tribute to. But they spent a boat load of money to NOT MAKE IT GOOD. The movies they are doing homage to? Those films were done on the cheap. These films were done for $53 million dollars! That doesn't include P&A, $53 million to achieve a look, feel and lack of quality of movies that cost much less.What's the freaking point? And as for Death Proof, it's a movie with a lot of women sitting around talking like QT. Nobody is talking about anything interesting, and they are all basically the same person. 4 people at a table who all act, think and talk alike is a boring conversation. Put that into a movie TWICE, with two different sets of actors, and man are you making a mistake.I have lost all respect for QT. Despite liking most of his other stuff, he's no longer going to take money from me at the box office. And I'm quite happy this movie is flopping, because it's going to make it a LOT harder for him to get funding next time.Remember how good his early stuff was with no money to spend (and Rodriguez too) and then try to tell me how ""great"" this double feature was. Like many others out there, I wanted to leave during Death Proof, but hung around thinking it must get better. There must be a reason for Kurt doing what he's doing. But there was no reason, it doesn't get better. It's just a dumb movie with no plot that just ends.Oh, and while they may think they were clever with their trailers, I've seen ""the Kentucky Fried Movie"" and well, these guys were 30 years late.

3 hour double-feature that amazingly kept my attention the ENTIRE time.  JUST AWESOME!!!!!,"WOW,'this is actually my first comment ever on IMDb but I feel like this double-feature deserved it. For $10 I was able to see two amazing movies that I would've paid to go see separately. I mean how can you beat that? It was nice to see two completely different movies in one sitting that both kept me on the edge of my seat. Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" was a fast-paced gorefest that was the perfect balance of comedy and horror. It was just simply a fun movie that had everyone in the theatre literally cheering for the good guys. Tarantino's ""Deathproof"" seemed to start off slow, but Tarantino fans will not be disappointed. During the first half of ""Deathproof"" it is not too action-packed, but the witty, sarcastic, and razor-sharp dialogue completely make up for it. The action, of course, is just plain awesome as expected! I cannot give either movie enough credit and you should most definitely see it in the theatre if you have the chance.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Average Alone, Incredible Together","For anyone who knows nothing about the Grindhouse films, they were packaged for theater as 2 movies, similar to a double feature you would see at a drive-in in the 1970's. These two movies were directed by Quentin Tarantino & Robert Rodriguez. The 2 have previously teamed in collaborations like Desperado & From Dusk Til' Dawn. While I like Tarantino films regardless, I think Rodriguez is much better when he's working with Tarantino.Death Proof (Tarantino's film) started off slow. Like many of his films. The movie was thick in classic Tarantino dialogue and the movie quickly became tiresome. Then in true Tarantino fashion the film reaches an action point. It was fairly early on but because the movie was so slow and uneventful in the beginning, when it does reach this first action series it has so much more impact. Then the movie kind of resets itself, almost beginning again. This time the movie is slow, filled full of dialogue and absolutely no intriguing events. The difference is that this time, as a fan, I know that it's all going to culminate in an exciting ending.The movie seemed to have went for nearly an hour with nothing happening. Just when I was beginning to lose hope in Tarantino again, he delivers the big ending I wanted. I've heard arguments that the ending wasn't as big as people wanted. Watching it in theaters, having gotten truly enthralled into what was going on, I was completely into the ending. It gave me exactly what I wanted. It was simple but effective. Let me tell you the people in the half full theater that day popped for the ending. They, like me had gotten enthralled into what was going on and they were clapping and cheering. A few stood up and a couple shouted out. It was a hell of a movie experience that I haven't ever had before or since while at a public screening.I suppose if you're half watching Death Proof at home you probably wouldn't get the same effect as if your entire attention had been grasped by the movie. Once again the hour of slow uneventful-ness paid off with an exciting ending that meant more simply because it was so slow for so long. That is how you build to a moment to get the most out of a little bit of action at it's best. If the movie had been full of action with an ending like that, it wouldn't have meant anything. Instead the movie spends the time investing you into the characters. Even if you at times began to hate them because so little was happening you were still unknowingly being invested into them. Then in the end it pays off.The Fake Trailers in-between the two movies were hilarious and just plain awesome.Planet Terror (Robert Rodriguez) was the biggest reason I was wary of Grindhouse. Some of Rodriguez's solo projects weren't very good at all. Planet Terror was heavily advertised with his girlfriend Rose McGowen having a machine gun for a leg. That made me the most wary. It was probably the most over the top, unrealistic and needless part of the movie. However I enjoyed both movies so much, it wasn't an issues like I thought it might be.Planet Terror was complete action. While it was over the top, it didn't pass many boundaries that I didn't find acceptable. It probably helped the movie that it had a zombie movie feel about it. Since I discovered the original Romero trilogy of zombie films, I've been a fanatic like most. For me it's not just the zombie that I enjoy. I also enjoy the the survival aspect that the zombies force people into. Planet Terror gave me that. There's a lot that happens in this movie. Plenty of cameo's. Lot's of scenes that are just slightly over the top but awesome scenes none the less. For instant the scene with the penis falling off while Tarantino's about to rape someone. Again, the testicles scenes with Naveen Andrews was over the top but still enjoyable. The Pulp Fiction briefcase style scene when they open up the trunk and it turns out to be a mini-bike was absolutely hilarious. I hate people who tell me to go into a movie expecting certain things and accept it for what it is. Usually when they say that it's because it's a movie that I hate or one that just exceeds the level of over the top I'll accept. Yet you gotta go into this movie with that mindset. If you're like me, you'll enjoy this. You'll probably enjoy it more if you watch the two movies together.Even after it was over, Death Proof was looked at like a slow paced, almost boring movie. Planet Terror provided the exact opposite. It was action personified. While either movie alone may only be slightly above average. One is too slow and the other too over the top. Combined the movies compliment each other so well that together they're much better. For anyone who hasn't seen these movies, I recommend not watching Death Proof or Planet Terror. Instead you should watch Grindhouse the way it was intended by watching both movies back to back in order with the trailers in between if possible. I don't know that you can duplicate the theater experience but if you come close you'll have a much more enjoyable movie experience.8 of 10 - An original movie theater experience that sadly most people didn't get to enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
3.45 hours of pure dynamite!,"Well finally I saw this movie the way it was intended. And to do that I had to do something I am usually against that is download it and burn it to DVD myself. Luckily it was excellent quality. Anyway I'm sure you know my reason's namely Weinstein's teasing UK movie fans for 6 months then giving Death Proof a release so limited that I'm not sure if there was a week between the trailer and the end of it's run.Anyway the film, the over all 3.45 hour Grindhouse experience is well fantastic I give it 9/10.Individually the films don't fair so well, Planet Terror is by far my favourite of the two, maybe because it captures the flavour of horror I am biggest a fan of, the works of Romero, Raimi and carpenter. Rodriguze's Carpenter inspired score is fantastic it must have unlocked some part of my mind that made me believe I was really watching an early 80s Carpenter flick at times. This fused with Rodrigueze's own hyper reality style made it sheer entertainment. The cast was fantastic in fact all that was missing was Danny Trejo, but his Machete trailer was kick ass enough! It is however Death Proof I unfortunately found many faults with, mainly what the hell is it supposed to be? A Car Chase Thriller or a Horror Slasher or a Revenge Thriller. it ends up none of the above. there is not enough car chases or cop involvement for it to be a Car Chase thriller, There is not enough suspense or deaths for it to be a horror slasher in fact all the deaths happened at once half way through the movie and relate to nothing. And the revenge aspect comes in far to late and to tell the truth there doesn't seem that much for them to get revenge for. What I see is a movie where women babel on so much dialogue I forgot what I was watching. it's a real shame as Kurt Russel was fantastic and Tarantino's camera work was great too. I just feel a little more Christine/Halloween influence and a little less Sex in the City would have made a more entertaining flick.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant Entertainment at the Movies!!,"Planet Terror and Death Proof are todays back to back grind house motion pictures. Grindhouse is a cinema which played back to back movies which were generally a shocker. The movies would be pushed past the limit to guarantee entertainment and usually involve explicit violence, sex, language, and other extreme material. The movies weren't much but they'd be sure to entertain you!Planet Terror was directed by Robert Rodriguez. It's amazing! I've never been so entertained with the explosive action or the experiencing of the shocking jaw dropping sensation from the frequent shocker. Planet Terror is sure to please. Action, humor, and gore are in millions! Rodriguez does a great job keeping you very entertained. Planet Terror does what a grind house motion picture is supposed to do and more! 9/10The in between trailers were hysterical and made a great addition to the movies! The best trailer for me would be either, Thanksgiving or Machete. Both of these are eye catchers, especially Thanksgiving =] They both were shocking and fun. 8.5/10Death Proof is the second film directed by Quentin Tarantino. I love Tarantino's works, Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, etc. Kurt Russel is incredible and is perfect for the villain. He catches your eye and is generally creepy as well. The story for Death Proof is very creative and the action scenes were really intense and suspenseful. I love how the film builds up, like all Tarantino films do, but when you reach the climax you get one hell of an adrenaline fueled, heart racing, scream your lungs out terror. Total kick ass. Death Proof definitely tops as one of Tarantino's best, and also does what Grindhouse is supposed to do. It's genius! 9/10In conclusion, I recommend seeing Grindhouse, it's INCREDIBLE! If you are in to this kind of stuff, you will have a blast! Grindhouse brings something totally new to today's cinema thats sure to bring audiences screaming for more. Only at THE GRINDHOUSE. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Over-hyped and Overrated,"I think I used this same title for a review I wrote for Borat last year. I am not a big fan of Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez is okay, but their efforts combined came out to be, in my opinion, a disaster. Planet Terror had its moments but it was really just gross and had little ""value."" The trailers in between were just...stupid. And Deathproof was even worse; it just makes you go WTF? the whole time and follows around a dull plot that is made even duller with all the excessive and useless dialogue which almost makes you forget what you're watching and ultimately deters from the experience. With that said, I would not recommend this film(s) unless you have a fetish for gore, mindless violence, and long, windy dialogue that gets you nowhere.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Grindhouse Excellente,"The best movie of the year! Actually the best movie I have seen in a long time. Robert Rodriguez & Quentin Tarantino struck gold. I didn't think Quentin could top Pulp Fiction but he did. Robert Rodriguez never disappoints me. His movies are incredibly creative & great. I like the fake trailers. I want to see those movies. This movie should win the Oscar but of course it won't because no one is sitting around a coffee shop talking about their relationship. When I first saw the trailer at the Scream Awards I have been so excited to see Grindhouse. It was worth every penny. Everyone should see it. I can't wait for the DVD. It is nice to see something creative & different. I like the old movie feel to it & the missing reels. Just brilliant movie making. Michael Biehn, Kurt Russell & Udo Kier, great casting all around.

Grindhouse Kills and Thrills as a Double Feature,"'Grindhouse' is a double feature recreating the experience of a 70's exploitation film grindhouse theater. It is made up of two films. The first is Planet Terror directed by Robert Rodriguez, and the second is called Death Proof which is directed by Quentin Tarantino.Planet TerrorPlanet Terror, directed by Robert Rodriguez (Sin City), is the better of the two movies. It is about El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez) and his go-go dancer (NOT stripper) ex-girlfriend Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan), who gets her leg bit off and eaten by zombie creatures referred to as ""Sickos"". The Sickos have broken out of their cages and have started infecting the entire town. With a machine gun/grenade launcher in place of her severed leg, Cherry must team up with her ex and the town's police station to defeat the Sickos and save their own lives. Planet Terror is bloody. Very bloody. In fact, the gore is so extreme that many will cringe and cover their eyes in many scenes. The violence is over-the-top though, so it's not too bad to endure at times. It is hard to label Planet Terror in one specific genre because it really doesn't belong to one. It's horror, action, sci-fi, comedy, and more. It is sick and twisted. Pure exploitation. The dialog is extremely cheesy, as is the whole film, really. But it is all done purposely to pay homage to similar B-movies of the past. Planet Terror is intense. It will make you laugh, cry, jump, cringe, cheer, and do god knows what else. It is great fun to watch. You will enjoy yourself throughout the entire fantastic film.****1/2Death ProofTarantino's ""Death Proof"" is about a psychotic ex TV stunt driver called Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell). He stalks his female victims with his ""death proof"" car. The girls that he stalks include characters played by Rosario Dawson (Sin City, Clerks II), Vanessa Ferlito (CSI:New York), Shannon Hazlett, Marcy Harriell, Zoe Bell, and Tracie Thoms. These women all play great roles and are interesting characters. The problem is, they talk. A lot. I don't have a real big problem with this, it is Tarantino's writing after all, which is usually fantastic. Parts of it are great. The dialog is fantastic and really roles in some parts, but in others, it gets somewhat tiresome and seemingly pointless. But enough about the dialog, lets talk about what we all came to the movie to see: the car chase scenes. The only thing more incredible than the car chase scenes, is the fact that they were done completely on location and for real. That means no stuntmen (except Stuntman Mike!) and no green screen. Tarantino, who admits he's a little fed up with the fakeness of today's car chase movie scenes, has taken it back to what it used to be: real cars, real people, real stunts, and only a few cameras set up, rather than an armada of cameras split a second a part from each other. And really, that is what makes ""Death Proof"" so fun to watch. Don't expect any serious conclusions or moral life lessons at the end though.****Fake Movie Trailers Grindhouse features several fake movie trailers before Planet Terror and in between the two features. The first is ""Machete"", which is rumored to be made into a straight-to-DVD release. Other trailers include Eli Roth (Hostel)'s ""Thanksgiving"", Rob Zombie's ""Werewolf Women of the S.S."" (also rumored to be made into a full movie because Zombie says he's shot enough footage for the trailer to be made into a full length film), and Edgar Wright(Shaun of the Dead)'s ""Don't!"" All of these trailers are hilarious and serve as great comic relief between the films. Some are quite disturbing and feature extreme violence, language, and nudity even though they are only trailers. All of them can be found on Youtube. ****1/2Full Experience****1/2 of *****",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Panem et circenses,"All fetishism and insincerity, Robert Rodriguez / Quentin Tarantino's new ""double feature"" Grindhouse recalls Jean Baudrillard's essay War Porn all to well.Grindhouse is not so much about the experience of those dangerous unrestricted public spaces (and subversive exchanges of power and ideas of yore), but the meaningless spectacle of fresh flesh slaughtered. It's the most base abstraction of a fertile field of abjection.In Grindhouse, Rodriguez and Tarantino miss the remark-ability of grindhouse cinema. They offer a pornography of arousal through bloodshed, rather than the hermetic, deep -- or deeply imagined -- fantasies exploiting the socially unacceptable desires of the audience while offering them, via the theater's very building, a safe haven from the ""just"" world outside, where those rules -- the rules of the grindhouse, the rule of the outsider, i.e. the rules of movie heroes -- do not apply.But for Rodriguez and Tarantino to make a movie with the mores of nearly half a century ago seems careless if not remiss. To copy those 70s postures without using them for a greater end is the work of underdeveloped sexual identity seeking to escape in to a pre-sexualized world where sex is but a metaphor for violence.By far the better movie maker, Rodriguez understands cinema and its textures. He understands that movies are a psychological medium predicated by desire and punctuated by the cut, fed by the repressed and interjections of the uncanny. Definitively Freudian in its grammar thanks to Germany's mass Expressionist immigration to Gothic Hollywood at the dawn of sound; cinema has today passed the point of construction because we the viewer understand how-we-watch-as-we-watch, but do not understand how-we-consume-as-we- watch because modern spectatorship isn't active. Active spectatorship examines the viewer's complaisancy in purchase -- the anthisisis of corporate media's end goals. Would Grindhouse have the irony and wit of Café Flesh rather than comic book ethos of Creepshow!America is the DVDs they buy. And what a DVD Grindhouse will make! Dramatic catharsis has moved from the climax of a movie to the orgasm of purchase attained in buying the ticket or the DVD. Alas more than anything else, Rodriguez and Tarantino's new Grindhouse is a packaged prefab entity perpetually ripe for repackaging and reconsumption. Only symbolic, modern art can have no definitive form because audience construction is the narrative.Rodriguez's stylistic ""defacing"" of image as represented in Grindhouse by faux splices, burnouts, and ""missing reels"" is as breathtaking and fresh as Lars von Trier's Dogma DV revolution.In a recent interview Rodriguez remarked: ""But it's used to dramatic effect, too. It's not really just aging for the sake of aging. What's cool is I got to use those as tools. . . . Usually your film grammar includes the fade, or the cross-fade, or the jump-cut, and that's about it. Now, you've got the splice-cut, you've got the film-burn, you've got the missing reel, you've got a lot of things to help accent the film dramatically.""Here is the path to groundbreaking modern film-making where the language of story and exposition is subverted for pure image and essay-like supporting details of content. Media is now so advanced that successful propaganda can be presented as infotainment on any subject -- all contexts are created after all -- and therefore it is meaningless to try anything but a deconstructive approach to creating new art. Rodriguez makes us aware of his (de) constructions and therefore produces work that is visceral and honest.If Andy Warhol presented a more polished (if primitive) fission of Jack Smith, Ron Rice and Andy Milligan, and explored the ""negative space"" of the cinematic canvas with ""strobe cuts"" and the one-time-only event of ****, then it goes to figure that Rodriguez understands America's I-am-what-I-own culture and done it one better introducing the ""splice-cut"" and ""missing-reel-cut"" to the mainstream via his and Tarantino's orgy of immature sadism.The Rodriguez / Tarantino universe is amoral and inaccessible in any meaningful way because violence, because character, because gender is meaningless there. Less than the sum of its parts, it's all just meat for the grinder -- the titillation of ""meat shots."" America is hungry for violence and vengeance because it informs character, nationally confused with purpose, in a nation of shoppers no longer able to divorce themselves from the products they consume.But perhaps Grindhouse is showing the populace the bodycount that corporate controlled ""news"" will not... Perhaps for Rodriguez whose segment flirts with the political, doubtful for Tarantino whose segment only flirts with himself...Tarantino, illy resembling a present day Hugh Heffner in his on screen appearances in Grindhouse, delivers his installment as DOA, leaden and tedious as the dullest Doris Wishman quickie. It's a dubious fidelity to the genre that is better glossed with Rodriguez's stylistic fidelity but flip 2008 pacing and tempo.The most successful moments of Grindhouse are the faux trailers, promising more than could ever be deliver by one movie, thusly delivering the very real dirty possibilities of ideas and imagination that are implacably real and the stuff of dreams.(April 6, 2007)",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unique and challenging,"I am so glad this film got made.... It is proof to me at least that people who work outside of the Hollywood system can make a film that surpasses the system and has fun along the way. I can just see the problems this film would have had if it had gone through Warner Brothers or the like. The execs would have been very confused by its stylistic choices. Thankyou Rodrigez and Tarantino for having the balls to do what you want to do. I was wondering how Tarantino could outdo Kill Bill, well here's one way to go beyond!!!!The best scene for me was the ending. I cannot say why but it is an amazing fight sequence.

"Rivals ""Norbit"" for WORST movie of the year","Okay, so ""Planet Terror"" was mildly amusing. It's far from the classic people want it to be, but it's watchable.""Death Proof"" on the other hand, was one of the biggest wastes of time I've experienced in YEARS. Slow, boring, far too much pointless dialogue, and even the acting is atrocious. Even Kurt Russell, who is usually enjoyable even in bad flicks (and he's done plenty), acts so badly in this movie you wonder if he's trying to tank this piece of junk movie on purpose.Taratino is such an overrated director. He made one great film (Pulp) and Reservoir was alright, but since then it's been self-indulgent, pointless crap filled with bad music, annoying characters, and lame dialogue. This man needs to retire NOW.Don't bother renting it, don't bother watching it for free. It's not worth your time....but yes, in the end, Norbit still holds the title for worst of the year.

Two Movies For The Price of One!,"Whenever people hear the word ""Grindhouse"" they think about slaughterhouses. But in movie definition, the term Grindhouse can be describe as paying one admission to see two back-to-back movies involving blood, guts, spit, ass, jiggly breasts, innovated weapons, hot women, crazy characters, crappy dialog, and grizzly scenes to make you cheer or want to vomit.I wanted to wait until after I saw both movies on Starz! yesterday to start my review. It's really a bloodbath along with shocks coming in all directions. Directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino combine everything they have from Rodriguez's Latin culture, love for horror cinema, gruesome gore and everything he can pull in his one man show from Tarantino's love for old classic movies and shows to making references from previous movies he's work on; blaxpliotation films in the 70's and bringing back actors to play the parts they were born to play.The first film out of the two movies is Planet Terror, directed by Robert Rodriguez. It's really a mix of Night of the Living Dead along with other classic horror movies as well. The film starts in a small part of Texas with Rose McGowan as a stripper name Cherry who plans on being a stand up comedian after not feeling like dancing anymore while meeting with her old boyfriend El Wray, played by Freddy Rodriguez of Six Feet Under, one cool Vato Hombre with a reputation that'll make your hair stand up. Meanwhile, in a part of the same area, Naveen Andrews (of Lost fame) is making a business trade with the military in which the chemicals he has create exposed zombies out of anybody that'll smell the substance. In another subplot, Dr. William Block (Josh Brolin) suspects something suspicious out of his wife/nurse Dakota (Marley Shelton) before finding out at the hospital. All hell is breaking loose in the small city where various victims go to the hospital after being bitten and start carrying infections where within a couple of minutes, they start to become mindless zombies going after everybody, including Cherry where her leg is cut off. Wray along with Cherry and a group of other people including the hard-ass sheriff Hague (Michael Biehn) and his clumsy assistant Tolo (Tom Savini, special effects artist) fight off the hordes of zombies before becoming the victims.Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" is described as bad-ass and one of the best horror/action segments I've ever seen in recent years. The way the film looks from frame one is an homage to all of the early films in the seventies where specks and spots would be seen not to mention a famous blooper along the way. Other actors include Jeff Fahey as a cook with some of the wittiest catchphrases along with Stacy Ferguson as a smoking hot babe and friend of Dakota before becoming one of the devoured victims; Michael Parks as the famous Earl McGraw, Quentin has a small role as a horned up army soldier who has an eye for Cherry before exposing his parts along with Bruce Willis as the man in charge of the military.Rodriguez is the master of his domain!4 out of 4 stars.The next half is Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" where it pays respect to actors who did their own stunts along with slasher movies where the sexy women always died. ""Death Proof"" takes place just before Planet Terror in Austin, Texas where a group of girls led by Vanessa Ferlito decide to have fun by drinking beers, hearing music and getting high. They meet Stuntman Mike (an eerie Kurt Russell) who is hitting on a blonde girl (Rose McGowan in another performance) before he talks to them. Ferlito's character is spooked of Stuntman Mike by the fact that his black car has been following her since she had gotten out of the apartment. After leaving the bar, Stuntman Mike takes his blonde beauty, Pam (Rose McGowan), hostage just before killing her and killing Ferlito's friends in the process. Fourteen years pass where Stuntman Mike starts his rampage of harassing young women all over again where this time he might meet his match if Rosario Dawson along with Zoe Bell could do something about it.Overall, ""Death Proof"" was good but not in the strength of a Tarantino classic nor as bad-ass as ""Planet Terror."" I loved Tarantino's choice of choosing Kurt Russell as Mike where it's been years since he played a character of tenacious and cool over the past from MacReady in John Carpenter's The Thing, to Snake in the ""Escape"" movies and Jack O'Neill in Stargate. The stunt scenes with Zoe Bell in a car chase sequence is one of the craziest I've seen in all my life where I closed my eyes. My only complaint had been that Tarantino's dialog and references slowed the pace along with the fact that after the first 56 minutes of the film, the reel look from the 70's was gone.3 1/2 out of 4 Stars.Overall, this is just a movie fan's dream come true.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
There great films.....if you can understand them.,"Rodriguez and Tarantino together again, first in sin city, now in the Grindhouse, were you get to movies for the price of one, something that was common 30 years ago. its not a secret that Rodriguez and Tarantino have similar eccentric taste. when i first saw the trailer for this film i immediately tough this was going to be huge box office success, an then on the opening weekend it barely made 11 millions dollars, i was surprised. then i saw the film or films, and i completely understood why it flunked. the movie is very strange. the only reason i could understand and follow the film its because i knew they were each trying to do their own 'b'class movies, whit cheesy story's,and lines, and the fake movie previews, the thing is that the 95% of the world population don't know this, you have to be a film critic or an actor, or at least a big movie fan to know this things. i was in the theater i could barely count 4 people who were following the movie, the rest of the audience was confused, some of them upset. now both films are great, but to my taste the one that Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed was better than Rodriguez film. most people in the theater were confused and upset in the Robert Rodriguez film, and a lot of people were laughing. when the fake previews came on most people didn't knew they weren't real. when the Tarantino part came on the audience stopped laughing and started paying attention although they were confused whit the end. now i think you shouldn't do a movie that only few are going to get, and if you're going to do a movie like this you should explain to people what you're trying to do, so they know what to expect, its not enough to just go on a talk show and explain the movie because its was clear to me that 90% of the audience didn't saw talk show. so i recommend that if you're going to see this movie try to see an interview of Rodriguez or Tarantino so you know what to expect, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Grindhouse - it's great (at least the first part is),"So I saw ""Grindhouse"" tonight. If you haven't heard about it, it's a take on old 70s style action movies, is a double feature, and features 'previews' of fake upcoming movies at the beginning and in between the 2 movies.I won't give any spoilers to the movies, but let me assure you that you WILL be entertained by the first film, 'Planet Terror' (if you don't mind some obnoxiously overdone gory special effects.) It is absolutely wild from the very start, and is filled with ridiculous creatures, goofy lines, and over the top action. I don't know that I can say that it was good, but it was definitely entertaining. And I recommend it.The fake 'previews' were also positively hilarious. Honest - they were muchco funny.The second film, Tarantino's 'Death Proof', is my new #1 most hated film ever.Worse than 'Who's Harry Crumb'.Seriously, don't stay for the second part of the Grindhouse double feature. You will thank me for saving you an hour and a half of your life.Listen, I'm a guy who is generally patient with movies - I even liked 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'. But the only thing that kept my attention after the first 20 minutes of 'Death Proof 'was the hope that everyone would die at the end.But I won't spoil the ending for you if you insist on staying for 'Death Proof'.

Got my moneys worth - Finally!!,"We just got home from seeing the Grindhouse on opening night, WOW what a flick! The whole thing is done so well and admittedly, I did have high expectations. There were 6 of us and we all enjoyed it from beginning to end. There were parts where everyone in the theater cheered, laughed, screamed, it was like the old days. There was not 1 person talking or being annoying in a packed 10pm show, in New York that is a lot to ask. But this movie is worth it.The first movie is the better of the two, it is truly intense action filled fun. I also adore Rose McGowan and although she is also in the second movie, the first was unbeatable. She was very un-Paige Matthews. The trailers do not do it justice and her performance was one of her best.The second movie had a little too much chick dialog for me (and yes I am a girl, but the 3 other girls I was with thought the same thing), but the payoff is worth it so pay attention anyway. It is a great movie and very original. The final message is great! The fake trailers are only bad in one way, you end up wanting to see these movies, ha ha. When you see these trailers, I defy anyone to tell me they would not go see Machete! The fake movies really look good and they put a lot of work in to them.The aged film and missing reels were fantastic. I must applaud this movie and since I am one of the few that didn't enjoy Pulp Fiction, that is a lot. If you have the chance spend the 3+ hours in the theater, buy a large popcorn and a coke, and be prepared to have a lot of fun. This is the first time in years where I actually feel like I got my moneys worth.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A taste of perfection (Planet Terror) and a little too much of bitterness (Death Proof),"GrindHouse is a really cool looking film that keeps its' promises until Death Proof.Planet Terror was a fast-paced film with tons of action. The acting was great, score was nice and the characters are very interesting. Death Proof was very slow-paced with little action and almost endless girl talk. Acting was very based on- and there was no humor or really anything to keep your interest.Death Proof's story made no sense, there was like 3% Kurt Russel in the film. It was trying to build up to the car scenes right? Well it took forever, almost waisting half the film.Planet Terror was perfect! the only problem was that I wished they switched the lengths of the two around, because I would of loved to see Plant Terror a lot longer. The trailers Macthee (loved it), WereWolf women of the SS (Funny, but a little lacking), Don't (great too) and thanksgiving was perfect.Death Proof- 7/10 Planet Terror- 9/10 Faux Traliers- 10/10 ----------------------- Grind House- 9/10Altogether GrindHouse is a very enjoyable film with Death Proof begin its only flaw.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Years ""Best"" Horror Movie(s).","I am a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. They're the masterminds behind some of my favorite movies in recent memory (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Sin City). And here is yet another sure classic, sort of. It's actually two sure classics, Planet Terror (Rodriguez), and Death Proof (Tarantino). These two films are a tribute to the low budget Grindhouse feature movies of the 1970's. Personally, I like Planet Terror better, but they are both splendid works of art. Not to mention the fake movie trailer at the beginning which is funnier than most full length comedy films these days.Robert Rodgriguez' ""Planet Terror"":Holy ****!! This is one damn good horror movie, easily the best since I've seen in several years. Taking place in rural Texas, Planet Terror is about a group of rag-tag survivors of a massive zombie epidemic. This group of people must evade the flesh-eating creatures of the undead and hunt down those responsible for the outbreak, and kill them all before the infection spreads across the planet. You can really see the look of the 70's in this film. Rodriguez purposely made it like this with the poor visuals and the missing reels at parts. This movie overall is amazing. It's very funny, full of action, and is by far the goriest film I've ever seen.Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof"":Although it doesn't quite match-up with Planet Terror, this is also a terrific horror movie, but it is far different. Death Proof is about a group of girls who are going about their normal daily lives in local bar. Little do they realize they're being stalked by a psychotic ex-stuntman who goes by the name ""Stuntman Mike"", who uses his crazy car to kill his victims. But these aren't the type of girls who take **** from anybody, not even a psycho stalker. Stuntman Mike takes these girls on the terrifying ride of their lives, and they're out for revenge. This movie starts out very slow and boring, but as the drama unfolds and the action gets underway, this movie will take you for the ride of your life. So yes, it starts out pretty slow, but if you hang through the boring beginning then you'll be rewarded greatly by Tarantino's master work.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"a joyous, fun bundle","My score flatters the two individual movies a little but this is such a joyous, fun bundle that overall it certainly deserves top marks. I was so dismayed when it became clear that the movie was to be chopped up for theatrical showings, I could not even get up the enthusiasm to go and see them. Am I glad I didn't know that we have the glorious Japanese DVD release spread over 6 discs. I watched it in one go and had a smile on my face, when I wasn't wincing, for almost the entire duration. First up after a great fake trailer is Rodriguez's 'Planet Terror' is fast moving and very gory with lots of great action plus a cameo from Tarantino as a rapist/jailer. I have to confess I looked at my watch about two thirds of the way through and I would say that because it is very much the same sort of zombie horror stuff all through it does begin to pall before stepping up a gear for the finale. Afterwards there are more fun trailers and then the excellent, Tarantino segment, 'Death Proof'. This is one great hoot with sparkling dialogue, superb action sequences and lots of lively humour and tremendous performances from everybody. I think it is a sign of a great director when all the cast, even non actors, are made to shine as they do here. It is really sad that this gem was so panned upon original release and it is only to be hoped that big sales for this DVD set will encourage more releases until we can have the whole thing back in the cinema, where I shall be first in line to see it all over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
So much dirty fun.......,I went the other day on my birthday to catch Grindhouse And I can tell you it was the best Birthday Present I was surprised how over the top PT was but really loved every minute of it(quite contrary to what my girlfriend thought) I have always been a fan of Rodriguez but have never seen him this good The one liners and cool action really steal the day.Note: The fake trailers are Totally cool and reminiscent of each of the brilliant directors who direct them!DP on the other hand my girlfriend loved being mostly about girlpower I also thoroughly enjoyed it being how I am a massive fan of everything Tarantino has ever done I thought the dialogue was kick ass And those car chases WOW!!!!Overall I rate Grindhouse 10/10 A real treat and Experience,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
2 poor and boring 'B' movies for the price of one. What a waste of money.,"There's a spoof trailer for a cheesy horror in the middle, It's called ""Don't"" If only they told me this before I bought my ticket.The first movie is a totally by the numbers, cliché and frankly rather dull ""Zombie"" B movie. We've all seen better a dozen times. OK there was loads of gore, but ""Braindead"" was better and that was made be a beginner for next to nothing.The second outing into crappy 'B' movie land is 75 minuted of talking followed by another total cliché of a car chase. To be honest, I couldn't tell you why anyone with any reputation to defend would go near this dull formula borefest.Let alone admit to writing it.Wait until it comes out on video or DVD. at least some format where you can fast forward. trust me at 3 hours, you'll wish the hell you could if you go to the cinema, Trust me the car chase isn't worth the wait.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

Quentin Tarentino..Also, the fake previews we're hilarious.The crowd enjoyed it as well. The clapping and cheering added to the old-movie-drive-in effect.Planet Terror>Deathproof Deathproof was a disappointment.I would have to give it a 10/10 I recommend this movie.

Planet Terror - 7    Death Proof - 8   Fake Trailers - 8,"So far Grindhouse has been one of the best films of the year. If you're a huge Rodriguez/Tarantino fan like myself than this is the ultimate experience. The fake trailers were down right hilarious and to be honest I could have watched plenty more. Starting off with the Machete trailer was a smart move. What wasn't a smart move however, was starting the double feature off with Planet Terror. I'm not saying it's a bad movie but it's a 90 minute, guns firing, non stop action, over the top violence, balls to the wall zombie film. What you've done is worked the audience up to be on this drug-like high where they want more fast, funny, adrenaline. Death Proof may be the exact opposite of this. The audience realizes that they have just sat through an hour and a half and that they now have to sit through another hour and a half AGAIN. It's time to get them in gear and make that 3 hour running time feel like 30 minutes. It's a shame too, as I felt that Death Proof was the better of the two. Many others however felt like it had ""too much dialog"" (it's Tarantino, what do you honestly expect?) and not enough Kurt Russel. Look, in order for us to LOVE Kurt Russel we must be teased by him. Give us a little Kurt here, a little Kurt there, and we'll be dying for more. But who am I to argue that as I would have loved more of his character!? Decide for yourself but this is without a doubt one of the more unique, explosive, and hilarious times you'll have at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun! Lot of fun! But not nearly as much as they promised...,"As much as I love the works of Hollywoods ubergeeks, namely Rodriguez and Tarantino, I was a bit disappointed by Grindhouse. It's fun to watch. Really. There's nothing more fun than watching Bruce Willis playing bad-ass as only he can in his brief but meaningful appearance, Rose McGowan with a machine-gun for a leg tearing through hordes of flesh-eating zombies or two vintage muscle cars clashing on local roads of Tenessee. The premise is great but the movie itself doesn't quite deliver. Even the fake trailers aren't as hilarious as everyone says (although ""The Werewolf Women of SS"" is so crazy you can't help but chuckle). I know they're just playing with the genre, making a homage/satire but I guess I'm not the only one to think they should just put their inside-geek to sleep and write something original for a change. Tarantino/Rodriguez changed the way of movie-making in the early nineties in more ways than any other directors of that generation but now they're stuck in their comfort-zone. It's still damn good entertainment, but it's not groundbreaking or even fresh (bar Sin City, but here the credits due more to Frank Miller). And stop making all those references and nods to some obscure classics, everybody's doing it now. I like Grindhouse, but I'm still waiting for something that would top El Mariachi or Reservoir Dogs. The competition has caught up and making films more ""Tarantino"" than Quentin himself, so now we can only hope that Tarantino/Rodriguez will soon show once again how to innovate and become true artists, not just some good craftsmen.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Go for Planet Terror, Leave before Death Proof","The first half of Grindhouse is really fun. Planet Terror delivers the goods with a furious pace and a ton of laughs. My only complaint is the film is not a 70's period piece. The look is totally Lucio Fulci but Rodriquez includes minibikes, cell phones, etc. The scratched up effects are fantastic.Death Proof is also not a period film but unlike the previous film it's a complete bore. Tarrantino must of thought his writing could entertain audiences for the first 60 minutes. It doesn't. It's dull. VERY DULL. People were leaving the theater it was so bad. The actors keep talking about the movie Vanishing Point over and over. I wish I had been watching Vanishing Point. Why did they put his film last? Must be his out of control ego. I've liked all his previous work, but this is just awful. I feel sorry for Kurt Russell. He deserves better. For some reason they ditched all the cool scratch effects that Planet Terror had. I don't get it. This should of been just a trailer. Seems Quentin needs to watch some of the Grindhouse movies before trying to make one.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Stylish, Pornographic Fascination with Violence",I gave this a one for style. It's got lots of style but for no reason. I always imagine Tarantino masturbating to graphic violence. He seems to have a pornographic fascination with violence. This is really porno for violence lovers but with a lot of skill and style. But what's the point? Homage to violence? If he did with sex what he does with violence he wouldn't be able to get his films made. Says a lot about America. It's okay to kill someone but not okay to make love. People let their kids watch movies with tons of violence in them but wouldn't dream of letting the kids watch sex in a film. I was able to watch this movie all the way through because I used the fast forward button frequently.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Did everyone really like both films?????,"Watched Grindhouse the other day and thought myself that QT film was not only too script driven but selfish, over indulgent and just outright boring in the end.Apart from the amazing crash and the latter chase, it was a girlie road movie.Insulting us with having not once,but twice list road movies of the past shows just what he thinks of the film going public.( Dhur was Vanishing Point really a road film????)I think that RR out shone him a million times and really got into the vibe of the double bills B movie feel. QT has really had his time and its time to move on from the "" look i can write a script with 2 people talking about nothing for half hour"" Pulp Fiction was his high point and its been self indulgent ever since. Move over RR taken your crown.....for good.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Cool ideas, not exactly executed very well","I'd like to commend the film makers for taking a cool idea of a 70's type flashback film and being brave enough to actually try it.This film will ultimately have some life to it, the question is: Is it going to be remembered as a brave experiment or a gigantic bad film bust?The movie is way too long. When I say long, I don't mean just because of the length...I mean it becomes too slow.Terror Planet is a cool little film, nothing amazing and it isn't From Dusk Till Dawn. But it is entertaining. The John Carpenter music was a nice touch. The trailers are a riot to watch. Death Proof is really sub-par. It was almost painful to watch. We are bored to tears by long dialog which goes on and on. It isn't even interesting dialog, it just makes us want to throw popcorn at the screen! The characters are so paper-thin you want to cheer when they are killed. Kurt Russell's killer character made no sense. He turns psycho one minute, cry baby the next.Yes, a cool but somewhat boring movie. How did this turn into a $60 million movie and counting?I heard rumors that the producers are thinking about re-releasing Grindhouse as two separate U.S. films. Publicity stunt? Definitely. Like Death Proof could even stand on it's own as a single film. And, like the producers are going to fork out more cash to release a ""loaded cigar"" this way.As another reviewer put it, see it at second run and walk out before Death proof- a little less painful.Cult or complete bomb? time will tell.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stunningly Awful,"Tarantino had a lot of fun making this movie! Unfortunately it was a lot less fun to watch it. While Grindhouse does have classic one-liners and great visual effects, that is also the movie's sum total. Plot is thin and hackneyed, characters are under developed and absurd, and I'm sad to say I was bored throughout.While I am a big fan of both the directors and actors, the plot and dialogue severely let them down. To those who rate the movie so highly, I can only imagine you were stoned, or else stared so deeply through the screen that you imagined something of substance shining back.If indeed Grindhouse is 'art' rather than the B-movie it appeared, then, simply put, I do not get it.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Expected much, much more.","I saw this movie for free, but still felt ripped off because I won't be able to get coverage payment for the lobotomy it'll take to remove this 3.25 hour block of idiocy from my memories.The only parts of this movie that were actually significant to me were the excellent trailers and some choice Kurt Russell scenes. I of course am going to be told I ""just don't get it"" or that I ""must be too dumb to see the point"", but I do understand what they were trying to do, and they failed to make this movie double-feature what it could have been.First of all, I used to love seeing cheap, crappy horror flicks by the dozen. Planet Terror was definitely not that. The movie cost about 19.975 million dollars more to make than any of those good ol' flicks, hence it was not cheap but overdone in an attempt to make it feel that way. When you're using a massive amount of special effects to make it look cheesy and crappily made, HOW DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER? If they were really going to do a cult horror movie in a true homage, it should have been shot the same way too - that poor production was part of what made them fun and entertaining and classic. So, Planet Terror was what could have been a great mind-numbing zombie romp, but turned out to be a cut of fillet mignon cooked extra crispy. And there are few things more disappointing than overdoing what could have been wonderful.Second, if I wanted to get an hour of airheaded girltalk dialog that had no real point whatsoever, I could have turned on WE on TV or gone to a local highschool or two. Tarantino took one thing that always bothered me a little bit about his otherwise-excellent films and saturated this one with it - he just made me feel like he was out to prove once again that he can fit a lot of big words and sentences and profanity into any given conversation that takes place, ever. There is nothing interesting about taking 4 girls babbling about the same things over and over and stretching it to coat a major portion of a movie. EVER. Yeah, I know you can write, Tarantino, I've seen your good movies. Kurt Russell was excellent in his part, and the action scenes were one of the only redeeming parts of this whole mess they threw together.So go for the awesome trailers interspersed throughout, see Kurt Russell get medieval on some frustratingly annoying girls, and make sure your theater has comfortable seats for the other 2.5 hours of nap time you stand to get out of this one.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not good: here's why...,"First I'll say that I completely love Tarantino and Rodriguez -- almost all of their work. Pulp Fiction and Sin City are two of my favorite movies of all time. However, in Grindhouse they have tried to exploit what they feel has been selling their other films: comically excessive violence. There is nothing new or interesting about this movie; it was simply advertised well. The fan base that Tarantino has created since Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction is gigantic, and rightfully so. And every fan will claim that Grindhouse is great, but only because they want to support the director who filmed these masterpieces. None of the characters are interesting or even likable, and there are long, long boring segments in which not a single thing happens. There is one coffee house scene with nothing but 15 minutes of meaningless girl talk. I only hope that this film doesn't mark the beginning of Tarantino's downfall. The fact that this film is taking up one spot on the IMDb 250 reveals the flaws and the incredibility of the IMDb rating system. Don't waste your time with this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Middle of the road grindhouse that does no one any favours,"I kind of try to understand it, but it still makes not sense. Two perfectly good filmmakers decide to make a grindhouse double bill to re-live their past: so far so good.But, they've done it too well. Rather than make masterpieces (of even the pretty good examples) of the (sub)genre, they have made exact simulacrum of middle of the road mid-80s grindhouse cinema. The lack of achievement matched to the uncompromising nature of the presentation (bad images, heads walking through shot, fading prints) makes this the worst possible entry point into the genre.Planet Terror - frequently inaudible, but don't mind as the dialogue never gets good, mixed with murky images derived from the well of ""The Beyond:, ""Nightmare City"" et al, but with actors reduced to posture instead of script and a hardcore desire to reduce every element into incomprehensibility in an effort to recollect the nihilistic abandon of Fulchi (in particular) and many other Euro trash auteurs. Biehn and Fahey give their all and show what genuine B actors with skill can do to an otherwise unredeemable script: they make it work, but their scenes are few and far between and in the mean time many a decent actor falls into the pit of bad acting, not realising that the point of these films for many was seeing good work in bad circumstance. It's an absolute blow out, and no surprise that this fares the worst of the two on international distribution.Death Proof (or ""Quentin Tanrentino's Thonderbolt"" as the briefly seen title card would have it is very different - this a film created from an obsession with 70s and 80s would- be road movies rather than Roderiguez's Fulchi-Avati explosion, and hampered by an abundance of dialogue - it's a full 40mins before we really get to the meat of the picture, a standout performance by Kurt Russell as Stunkman Mike, who really deserves a better film than he's given here with it's ""women talking - they get killed by mike - he scopes some other hotties - he tries but fails to kill them and turns the serial killer stereotype on it's head as he turns into a screaming wimp once he's injured. Sure, there are laughs to be had - not least the abrupt ending, but still it's a serious film maker wanking til he does his next work (and what an obsession with women's arses he's developed since we last saw him in action).in all, neither film is satisfying - if only they had decided to use the tropes to make stand-out exemplars of the genre rather than going for easy hits for the fans.A genuine grindhouse night is better made in your own home with the likes of The Blood Spattered Bride, The House With the Laughing Windows, The Strange Case of Mrs Wardh, The Beyond, Nightmare City, Spasmo, The Case of the Scorpions Tail, Death Walks at Midnight and Zeder in any order or combination making for a much more satisfying reliving of the old grindhouse days, when you sat down not knowing if you were going to be amazed by events on screen or touched up.In terms of the trailers, they just add insult to injury by being far, far more entertaining that either of the main features. Standouts are Machete and Don't. But all of them are better than the features and this is never a good thing.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horrid,"Quentin stars a huge mish-mash of famous actors in this horror flick that sets out as something that reminds you of how poorly a movie is when it's directed to one audience, the average American consumer. To me, this is all that was wrong about ""28 weeks later"" compared to it's predecessor. No brains, just another one of these zombie flicks that remind you of that Rodriguez/Tarantino vampire series that rival this one.From start to end it's a hymn to brainless tasteless action without any red thread going through the movie, shallow characters, braindead plot, and largely something that make the Hammer Horror films of old look like ""The Godfather"" in comparison.I must be the wrong person to watch this. This movie is as entertaining as vomiting after eating too much pizza.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"RR did it good, QT killed it","RR made a fantastic B movie style kill fest, i could not have been happier with Planet terror, and if it came out on DVD (by itself) i would totally buy it. The fake movie trailers were also completely awesome.But Tarentino made the slowest,most boring,and life wasting piece of crap I've ever seen, Maybe it was because it was 1am when it came on or the fact that it seemed that the movie was like a Lifetime special of women talking. It is an hour of my life I want back.All i have to say is Jackie Brown was bad but Deathproof may seriously win the award of Biggest Yawn EVER! So go see this movie and enjoy Planet Terror, but do yourself a favor and leave the theater before Tarentino's self gratifying pile of a movie takes away minutes of your life that you could spend doing anything else.

Dumb and Dumber costing $88 million.,"Now released in Australia and clocking in at a ridiculous too-long 191 minutes, this cynical vicious and boring vanity piece by Hollywood's misogynist violence peddlers seems to believe that their names and some extensive female mutilation and humiliation will once again strike a chord with the sort of 20-somethings who kill classmates in hallways. Fortunately here in Oz GRINDHOUSE was snuck in under the radar into one cinema (yes just one) and met with a nonplussed crit and box office. By virtue of being on one screen only it can report healthy first attendance (70% drop week 2) but that is really the only 'healthy' thing about this wasteful misfire. Here is a supposed double feature of crappy films with crappy trailers in between. It's a good idea and could be fun if it was created and presented as such. In fact it is also an old idea, the film MOVIE- MOVIE from the 70s with George C Scott gave viewers a fake double feature of as if we had gone to the movies in 1933, complete with fake movie trailers, so did Weird Al Yankovic's VIDIOT FROM UHF in the 80s. With GRINDHOUSE we get the abattoir version of 70s drive in flicks up-slashed with seriously vicious female humiliation and mutilation. We get two indulgent directors who do not know when to stop (as opposed to 'cut') and each idea of two 90 minute films is misguided as they are 20 minute ideas. If GRINDHOUSE ran a total of 100 minutes (like MOVIE MOVIE) then it would work better because the curiosity value can only sustain itself for that shorter period. I am again saddened at the horrific cruelty towards women in DEATH PROOF which clearly did not impress the young audience at the opening night session I attended. The film stopped being any sort of fun and really dampened any enthusiasm this crowd of 20 somethings showed. PLANET TERROR is a zombie film and as such alone is disappointing as the poster alludes it being science fiction, not just another boring ugly zombie blast-em 'spectacular'. As a production and a release, GRINDHOUSE is a spectacular financial failure and hopefully will see the real end to this disgusting extreme screen cruelty (as some warped spectacle) that Tarantino and his disciples insist the cinema-goers of the world find interesting. Game over QT. Note: one fake trailer from Eli Roth has a cheerleader getting killed when she does the splits onto a large knife. These film makers display a pathological hatred of women and their inherent beauty as human beings. GRINDHOUSE is all about killing and mutilating the human form. Nothing else. I would love to hear Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell's daughter's reaction at seeing their father participating in this vile cruelty.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Really disappointed,"If not for Rose McGowan to look at in the Planet Terror first feature, it would have been a total loss. I enjoy movies that pay homage to older genre's, but when you do one, you have to do it well.

I am sure it will appeal to the 17 and under crowd if they can slip in, but all in all I felt I wasted my money on this one.

Looks like a cheerleader movie in a retro theme. Don't spend your money on crap in the name of ""art"", cause this ain't.I could've farted a better movie. Just cause they're well known names, it doesn't mean you should see their movies. The acting is horrible, but hey, they'll say ""that was intended"".

Long talks again leading to no where, no sense overall, nothing at the back yard. This was a real the wost film of Tarantino I guess.

Disappointing,"The whole movie would have been one of the highlights of the year, but in all honestly Tarantino's segment ""Death Proof"" rather ruined it.This is a long movie, and after the magnificent ""Machete"" and Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" I was getting fairly worn out with all the action! However up to this point is was absolutely terrific stuff.However Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" was far less resolved, overly long and self important in my opinion. Kurt Russell's excels in this piece and the action (when it happens) was excellent. But the dialogue... what a load of old rubbish... QT could have easily cut 30 minutes out of this part, but seems to have felt obliged to at least equal the running time of Rodriguez's section no matter what.When you are 2-2½ hours into a movie the last thing you need is pointless, dull dialogue which does nothing to advance the plot or the characters - I felt my attention seriously wandering and could have fallen asleep.Both directors deserved a huge amount of credit for paying homage to and reinventing the Grindhouse genre with such enthusiasm. So many cameos and nods to great movies (like the white Challenger). It's just a shame Death Proof was not edited down more or this would have been something to rival Pulp Fiction as a piece. I've marked it 5/10 but it would have been 9/10 without the dull sections of Death Proof.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Leave after the trailers,"The two movies-within-the-movie simply do not work together. The first film, the Rodriguez ""Planet Terror,"" is terrific lively fun, and the action never lets up. It's the sort of thing a grindhouse director might actually have made if he'd had a bigger budget and a lot more talent than most of his peers. The trailers midway through are extremely funny and maintain just the right grindhouse tone. But the Tarantino film that follows is a dreadful, talky-talky-talky bore, a true endurance test that just goes on and on and on like some kind of Andy Kaufman stunt... until finally you get a few minutes of automobile collisions. The group of ""heroines"" are downright repulsive, unattractive, and masculine, and the theme of butch women beating the crap out of an evil male is -- well, more a product of Tarantino's personal fantasies, I think, than of the true grindhouse world.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Half a good movie (sort of),"I'm not exactly sure why I went to see ""Grindhouse."" I tend to admire Tarantino's movies, to an extent, but I also find them rather too gross and vapid to be genuine film classics; Rodriguez, for his part, has directed some of the very worst action movies that I've ever seen (""From Dusk 'Til Dawn"" and ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" leap to mind).But hey, this has been a boring month for movies, and I guess I counted on ""Grindhouse"" to liven things up a bit. And it certainly did jolt me, so for that reason at least I enjoyed it.The first segment, directed by Rodriguez, is mostly mediocre. It's pretty much just a lame zombie movie, with a minimal plot and poorly developed characters. It's so violent that it has impact, but there were a few too many moments of ""penis horror"" (so to speak) for my tastes. If you enjoy constantly squirming at revolting scenes of bodily mutilation, then yeah, I guess this segment might float your boat. Me? I'm sick of gross zombie stuff - but I did enjoy seeing Michael Biehn in action again.Tarantino's segment is better, but not perfect. I loved watching Kurt Russell's performance as a grizzled stunt driver (was he really not the first choice to play the part? That's strange - he's perfect for it). Thankfully, Tarantino actually reins in the violence a bit, which is nice after Rodriguez's endless splatter-fest; he also serves up one of the more exciting car chases in film history.Even the Tarantino segment has dead wood, though. He introduces us to two virtually interchangeable groups of young women, who all speak in that ultra-cool ""Tarantino Talk"" that is supposed to mirror real-life speech (but doesn't). Frankly, I found it hard to relate to these pop-culture-referencing, pot-smoking, potty-mouthed and generally surly females, but I suppose Tarantino meets people like them all the time. Anyway, their endless yakking was not particularly interesting to me, and I found myself longing for Kurt to show up more often.Still, ""Death Proof"" is cool overall.Easily the most fun part of the movie is the fake trailers - they're pretty much all hilarious. Interestingly, at least two of them seem to be based closely on real movies - ""Werewolf Women of the SS"" is almost certainly inspired by ""Isla: She-Wolf of the SS,"" while ""Don't!"" looks a lot like ""The Legend of Hell House."" Incidentally, there's a simply awesome cameo in the Werewolf Women trailer.So yeah, I kind of enjoyed ""Grindhouse,"" on balance. But the main thing that's sticking in my head is the gross images, not the ideas or the characters or the dialog. Once again, I must conclude that critics and film enthusiasts have overrated a bizarre product from two very bizarre directors...but at least it provoked me (a little).",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why..,"OK first off its kinda odd everyone thinks Planet terror was better. Im sorry but the obsession with testicles was just wrong. The cheesy dialog was ear bleeding. The idea was pretty good i admit and the cast was pretty top notch. I think it was a waste of money and time myself. I nearly fell asleep during both flicks. I laughed perhaps twice during both flicks as well. I feel any movie with Mcgowen is a flop even her shows. I think Quinton is a idiot and needs to stop making movies as it seems every flick he makes goes more and more down hill. Deathproof i felt was better mostly because it was about cars. The dialog not much better then the first. The cast was not to bad. Lost the obsession with lesbianism and testicles! However i state this, Austin born and raised guy! Terrantino wasted his time going to Austin. He showed two of the WORST places to go for drinks and or food. The lower part of central Austin where nothing happens for a action movie. There were so many spots they could have used the first part of Deathproof in the city and he fails at his choices. I saw it and i wished i had stayed around my dorm instead. Pointless, Beyond over exaggeration in every sense even if it is to put play on the 70's style movies. They even had plots then.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

ultra low quality bloody soap opera,"Since Pulp Fiction that Quentin Tarantino means a lot to a huge audience, that simply doesn't question his work, no matter how bad it is, as if under some spell. If Tarantino had no past and his only movies were his latest, then he would already know what anyone, distant enough, knows: his imagination is blood red but the shock effect is gone in a minute, and when the silence returns, after all the fireworks, all that remains is crap. Crap. Crap. I can't believe how bad his movies became. Is he doing it on purpose? Some experiment on viewers manipulation? Later in life, he'll probably return to ""reservoir dogs"" level with a masterpiece that jokes with the current ""movies"" and how some people could enjoy them.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
lose a couple more reels,"interesting concept, some nice art direction but way, way too long. when the Machete 'trailer' is one of the highlights, you should know there are some serious issues with the film.Too much dialog exposition glitzed up with saturated color and ersatz cheezy production effects gets to be a drag after a while (and this movie takes several whiles to run). In particular, the 'Death Proof' segment drones on and on so long that it feels like you need to pound some of that Chartreuse too.If this was cut down to something like 100 minutes instead of 190, it would be a lot more entertaining. Someone needs to tell these guys that less is more and not every 'outrageous' thing is necessarily needed to outrage.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the worse film I seen this year.,"I don't know if people's taste in movies are getting worse, or..., no, it is getting worse. I wonder which part did people actually like to give this movie a 10/10 rating. Maybe they are getting paid to write those comments. To sum it up, the storyline is weak and nothing new, the conversation in this movie (death proof, planet horror) are both useless and boring. The gore displayed in this movie is once again, nothing new, nothing to be thrilled about. I think the only people that would think this movie is worth the money are those who just turned 17 and watch a R rated movie for the first time in their lives. Otherwise, I wouldn't believe there are people actually think this one is good.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worst piece of crap i have ever seen,"For the love of god, i can't figure out why this movie got such a decent rating. It provides 2 more or less splatter scenes, the rest of the movie is either girl talk or other gay actions. In comparison to other Quentin Tarantino movies this was the worst piece of crap he ever produced (for me it totally ruins his reputation). There is no actual story line, just fancy talk and a lot of swearing.Turns out the bad guy is the real pussy in this one...Consider yourself warned, don't waste nearly 2 hours of your life watching this crap.I'm serious, don't waste your time.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Highly Uneven Experimental Film That Falls Short of Expectations,"Rodriguez and Tarantino's ""Grindhouse"" is a highly uneven homage to ultra-violent exploitation movies. It is entertaining at some points, but it drags on tediously for long periods of time with needless exposition and unnecessary dialogue throughout its over-bloated bulk; this is especially true of Tarantino's half of the movie, titled ""Death Proof."" I suppose this movie is best suited for those inured to watching exploitation movies, as those who haven't may be highly puzzled by the film and will ultimately not enjoy the experience as much as those who have been used to watching such movies.The best parts of the movies are, ironically, not the double-feature films, but the fake preview parodies of schlock horror movies. ""Machete"", ""Werewolf Women of the SS"" and ""Thanksgiving"" were excellent parodies, superior to anything that could be conjured by the minds of the most talented SNL writer. They greatly exaggerate the already exaggerated sex and violence one would see in a cheesy horror or action movie to hilarious effect. I loved the cameos by Cheech Marin and Nicholas Cage; they not only get to ham it up, but they seem to actually enjoy what they're doing.And now for the not-as-good parts, i.e. the rest of the movie. Both films in the double feature suffer from special effects that look far better than anything a real exploitation movie might ever have had. If the point was to make the films look cheap, both directors failed on this account. Scratching the film negatives and inserting tongue-in-cheek homages to poor-quality films, such as ""missing reel"" notes and hiccuping film reels do not cover up the fact that this was, in fact, a big-budget movie poorly disguised as a camp film parody. Both movies also feature sappy love stories which detract somewhat from the blood-and-guts action that is supposed to be the films' main draw. One of the protagonists in ""Death Proof"", Cherry (played by Rose McGowan) seems too sensitive and emotional to play what was advertised as a gun-legged, tough-as-nails antihero. The actors also seem like they're actually trying to act well IN A REAL big-budget Hollywood action movie, rather than some cheap horror film.I have two pet peeves about the second ""Grindhouse"" feature, ""Death Proof,"" are more annoying than everything I have just mentioned. One, what's with the text-messaging in the movies? It serves no purpose at all, other than fill up screen time. I feel like I'm watching a T-Mobile commercial, for heaven's sake! Secondly, and more importantly, the inane dialogue amongst the female characters in the movie. it's just very boring and plods the movie to a screeching halt. I have no idea why Tarantino thought stopping heart pumping sex and violence with boring talk for more than half an hour would be a good idea.Now for the good points of the double-features: the excessive violence. ""Planet Terror"" excels in this respect, with more slicing and dicing of zombie bodies than you could possibly imagine. One adjective I could use to describe ""Death Proof"" would be ""gooey""; another would be ""pulpy."" Kurt Russel also does well as the evil Stuntman Mike, and its a terrible shame that he wasn't in the film more frequently.I don't recommend this movie, as the bad outweighs the good. Still, I think it's probably worth the wait for a DVD rental---you can fast-forward past the boring parts, which sadly take up too much time.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The TRUE horror was that I actually sat through this crap.,"Let's get one thing straight; I'm not one to love a movie simply because I loved a previous movie made by a director. Example: 1941 sucked. But Duel, Jaws, and most other Spielberg movies are good. Example: Gangs of New York sucked. But Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and several other Scorsese movies are good.Example: Grindhouse sucked. But Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Pulp Fiction and (few) other movies by these directors are good. So anyone who obsesses over Tarantino...GET REAL. I've seen stuff on YouTube better than his crappy-ass segment, ""Death Proof."" Why is it that critics are praising the fact that he gives female characters dialogue? That SHOULD be a standard that we take for granted. ""Death Proof"" is sexist crap that uses fake jive, no acting, and is TOO LONG. If I wanted to see a bad horror/action/cult/comedy movie from the 70's, I could go rent one. Why on earth is it considered stylized to make a movie that's UNSTYLIZED? And the worst part is, he takes it seriously. No B.S. here, people, Tarantino just made a 90+ minute SERIOUS bad action movie that is attempting to mimic other BAD ACTION MOVIES. That is called ""crap on a stick"" or (pardon my French) ""crappe a la mode"" if any other director does it, but Tarantino? OH, no HE's special. HE's a real genius. How does everyone know this? Well, his mommy said he was special...You might wonder why I even saw this movie if I hate Tarantino so much. Answer: It was a double feature and I like Rodriguez. The admission price is two for one, and I had budgeted the whole afternoon. And strangely enough, though ol' Robert's segment, ""Planet Terror"" seemed even stupider than whiny-boy Quentin's at first glance, it was actually the superior film. Zombies? A lady with a gun on her leg? (not gonna mention the spoiler on that one...) Well, at least it really WAS funny. Rodriguez MOCKS these bad 70's films whereas Tarantino IDOLIZES them. Rodriguez's segment has a lot of lag, but is still a fun ride from start to finish. It's a decent B movie, whereas Tarantino's segment feels like it's an IMITATION of a WANNABE B movie...because it is. Rodriguez has some true talent, so it's unfortunate that he is in a professional partnership with a deranged sexist madman. If he's smart, he'll go down to the courthouse, pay the fine and plead with the judge to erase the DUI from his record...Directing Under the Influence...in this case of Tarantino.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nonsense,"To be honest, I was expecting something good from this double feature. I am not surprised that it was a box office bomb but I am surprised that it got decent reviews.Both the movies were literally bad; first one being literally nonsense, the second one was under average. The stories were bad, the screenplay was uneven, the directions were bad and average respectively and I don't want to talk about the performances as I can't explain that to you.Overall, I don't think that you should give this 3 hour+ nonsense a try as it is neither entertaining nor enjoyable. Instead, you will want your 3 hours back.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wow this movie was bad!!!!,"OK, I was expecting great things for this movie, I come from New Zealand so there was very little buzz about this film, actually I didn't know anybody else that had heard of the movie. So I downloaded it as soon as I could, Wow was I diappointed. With such a credible cast and two fantastic directors I couldn't understand why it was so bad. The acting was pitiful to say the least, the blood and gore was to be expected but with such bad acting and in planet terror such blatant plagiarism it was just terrible from beginning to end. In New Zealand about a year after it was released it was cut to just Deathproof for reasons unknown to me, or perhaps the people that release the films in NZ realised how crappy planet terror is. The only things that were any good in the movie was the NZ actor stunt woman doing here thing and the lap dance which raises it up from a zero!! You people voting for these movies need to realise that your absent minded votes affect the top 250 list and keep out truly great movies so you can say that your favourite marketed movie for the week gets into top spot. This list needs to be policed",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sometimes I think there is something wrong with me,"I do not seem to see what so many other people see. I have to admit, I am not a Rodriguez or Tarantino fan to begin with... they both have done a few things I enjoyed, but mostly I tend to finish viewing their films feeling like I missed something everyone else saw. (For the record, I really continue to try to enjoy Tarantino and Rodriguez... I just have to be honest and say that I don't... and often find Tarantino to be unreasonably offensive. Why are racism and misogyny quite so amusing to a white male from Texas?)I will admit, I liked Planet Terror a bit more than Death Proof... which makes sense, as I tend to favor Rodriguez over Tarantino.Both of them seem to revel in kitsch to the point that I feel like they make the same movie over and over and over again. Rodriguez seems to have more fun with his kitsch than Tarantino, who appears to try to pass it off as superior artistic vision... when really, its no different than a Seth Rogan film.If you are one of those people that gets off watching Tarantino films because you think it makes you artistic, then by all means watch Death Proof and revel in your 'artitude.'If you are the type of person that likes ""bad"" horror movies... you will probably enjoy Planet Terror.If you like a movie that has subtext, or if you want developed characterization, original cinematography, coherent plot lines.... then you probably already know that a Tarantino/Rodriguez double feature is a waste of your time.(Personally, I suggest watching a Romero ""Dead"" marathon instead.)",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
unaccountably useless,"I don't think this ""film"" has anything to do with art or anything similar to art. I didn't find anything good, useful, worthy... not even fun in this film. It brought me only big pain in my ass that that great amount of money was used to create something so stupid and disgusting as this thing. I thing these directors are too busy worrying about something new and outbreaking to create, that they have forgotten about the most important thing, which is to bring some joy and thoughts to peoples minds.This way most people who watch these films just leave the cinema with second rare opinion about them and are glad to come home and get rid of all spoiled things the movies provided them with. To compare the two segments, Tarantinos DeathProof is much better than Planet terror, although the ratings say something different. Kurt Russel is fine, girls are fine, but I just cant find it amusing and entertaining at all. And Planet Terror...I am out of my words, it is just........absolutely useless, disgusting and pathetic.But still, both films don't deserve to get into the television of viewers, not even to the cinemas. My advice is: don't waste your time by watching this crap and go play outside with your kids or just turn off the TV and take a look outside your window...it will be much more worthy than spending your time with two idiots ... Tarantino and Rodriguez.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Half is fun,"I liked the Rodriguez portion. It was a fun romp. If I could rate it separately I'd give it a 6. Zombies, guns, people you actually care about, plot. Quentin on the other hand had a major bump in the road. I've seen my share of trash, Russ Meyer, Uwe Boll, Ed wood, but this. This was as close to walking out of the theater as I've been in twenty years. Stay away. As for the IMDb system  as of 4-11-7 this is rated an 8.6. Hello? I gotta say IMDb should take a long look at everybody who voted and see if they have more than 3 votes over the last year to their credit. I can't in good conscious give the Quinton portion a 2. If I could vote separately this would be my first one star movie. Dull, awkward, slow, ugly, dreck. Rosario needs to get a new agent & think about where she wants to be in 5 years. First ""Clerks two"" and now this? There is taking risks, and then there is stoopid. ""Monsters Ball"" was taking a risk, but the potential was there to make an incredible movie. Halle tried to step up, & should be given major slack for it. This has got me wondering what Rosario has done. If it wasn't for ""Sin City"" & ""The Rundown"" I'd totally write her off after this. Over all I'm going to give it a 4 but that is in the hope that audiences everywhere will walk as soon as the second half starts.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Experiencing the grimy & sleaze of Grindhouse at the drive-in theatre,"I went to the drive-in theatre for the purpose of experiencing the rough film aesthetics of Grindhouse Friday night. I have not been to the drive-in theatre for at least 15 years but Grindhouse provided the reason to see the movie under a specific setting for optimal movie-going experience.It was probably most popular screening at the drive-in because of the large number of vehicles parked to view the movie.However, I wonder what the hell were these parents thinking for bringing children to see Grindhouse. There's Firehouse Dog/TMNT double feature shown on the left side screen during the movie.I saw young boys and some girls with their parents. Mostly Hispanic.Grindhouse is NOT for kids. Planet Terror may be goofy fun that seem to have paid more homage to Resident Evil video game series (especially part 2 & 3) than Zombie films. Death Proof depicts banality of evil in depth as exerted by Kurt Russell's turn in ""crazy"" acting but maybe too slow paced in heavy dialogue scenes (brilliantly acted in long shots, the actresses really mastered their dialogue skill flawlessly like it's a live theater). After a few amusing fake trailers shown, the last trailer Thanksgiving elicited profoundly disturbed reactions as seen from the vehicle occupants nearby.No doubt Thanksgiving trailer give the parents some pause as to what the hell were they thinking for bring kids in the first place. Eli Roth may be talented in revolting horror film-making but Thanksgiving is a sick, stomach-churning trailer that makes me question Eli's mental health in pushing the envelope as maximally as possible in a few minutes. Frankly, that trailer is the most disturbing part of the Grindhouse movie and it made me feel queasy as a 'jaded' horror fan.Interesting to note that because Death Proof paced so slow with seemingly endless dialogue scenes, a few vehicles left after ten minutes and some parents walked their kids to the concession with arcades and back.What makes the drive-in experience bizarre was there was the firework display for some ten minutes in the distance while the car chase towards the end in Death Proof is being shown. People in the vehicle were distracted in bewilderment.It was a jolly good time at the drive-in theatre. However, if you dislike slow-paced movies, then would be the time to leave Death Proof after ten minutes of expositary dialogue -- it goes on literally forever...Tarantino & Rodriguez did a splendid job of duplicating the gritty & sleazy grindhouse experience from the 70's, with the fake trailers upping the ante in over the top violence. But it's not enough to justify the reason for existence -- it's fulfilling the wet dreams to demonstrate their entry in the B-movie realm and hope the experience might be the same as they had experienced when they were young.Hard to believe the MPAA didn't give Grindhouse a NC-17 rating for Thanksgiving trailer alone, that seriously demented piece might have seriously traumatized children the stupid parents brought to force them to watch.** 1/2",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
awful,"The worst movie a have ever seen. I can't believe that it has this rating. It is awful!!!! I have forced myself to watch till the end. And i am the kind who likes zombie movies but this is worse then ""The night of the living dead III"". I think it doesn't deserve even user rating 1, it's rating should be -1000. This movie can't be watched. It should be banned for distribution. All recordings of this movie should be destroyed and all mention of it should be erased from existence. First of all it does not have a storyline at all. The ""story"" it does have is something like childish imagination, nothing more. The thing with the machine gun leg is the best example of that. And it isn't funny at all so it can't even be a comedy. My impression of this film is that is something like a bunch of images shown in a sequence, without any link between them, resulting ""Grindhouse"". I strongly recommend that people should not waste the time to watch this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Seen 1 Tarantino Film you seen em all,"Quentin Tarantino does it again, literally, if you have seen 1 Tarantino film you've seen em all, there is nothing new here, same homage to the same people from the same guy....Rodriguez tried hard but seems to be swallowed up by tarantinos penchant for 70's movies, and as for Eli Roth he's kind of like a ""mini-me"" of Tarantino.Now this double feature incl trailers is just too long, filled with huge segments of dialogue (blah, blah, blah), some dodgy acting, directed by roth and rodriguez who gave me the feeling they thought they were creating a work of art when it is all really just a long boring ride along Tarantinos Ego (very long) There are a few places where you do say ""WoW that was very cool"" but a lot more where you find your self saying ""What The ?"" and even more where you will be yawning.Although there are many comments saying this movie was fantastic but I believe you will be hard pressed to find any (who have rated this movie highly) went to watch it again. Now that to me tells you whether a film is great, and I don't know anyone in their right mind who would sit through the endless ego trip this movie truly is.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Death Proof - highly entertaining; Planet Terror - disappointing,"Death Proof: 8/10Very entertaining and action-filled.Good drama and fun, with some good action scenes. Has the depth of character and amusing conversations and diversions that make Tarantino movies so special.However, not as multi-faceted as any of his other movies, and a deliberate attempt to make a B-grade movie, this is Tarantino's worst movie yet. Not that it is bad, just not as good as any of his other stuff, and considering that ""other stuff"" includes some of the greatest movies ever made - Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill - this is not a great insult.Planet Terror: 2/10Disappointing.I liked the Quentin Tarantino contribution to the Grindhouse pair of movies, ""Death Proof"". I have always been more of a Tarantino fan than Robert Rodriguez, but thought ""Sin City"" was brilliant and expected at least something entertaining for ""Planet Terror"". No, it is incredibly lame.Plot is full of holes, action sequences are incredibly contrived, acting is wooden.I realise that this was a homage to the Z-grade cheap horror Grindhouse movies of the 70s, but Rodriguez didn't have to be so faithful to the genre and make a crap movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
