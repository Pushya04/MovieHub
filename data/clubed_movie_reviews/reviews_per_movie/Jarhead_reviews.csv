A realistic glimpse into our history....,"I was reluctant to see this movie. As a veteran of Desert Shield/Storm, I spent my first 90 days in-theater in the Weapons Co of A Swofford's Battalion. I later was moved to the 1st Bn of 7th Marines, but having been in the same unit for some of the same time I felt I could offer readers a unique perspective on the film's accuracy.From a purely aesthetic perspective I thought the film was well done. The acting was very good, and the script was well written, witty, and accurate. The actors were well suited to their roles. My personal preference for a good plot would have been disappointed were it not for my personal interest in the film. In my opinion this film is an outstanding dramatic-documentary, so adjust your expectations accordingly. If you are expecting a driving plot line and all the accompanying dramatic tension, then I think you will be disappointed (as many whose comments I heard exiting the theater certainly were). But if you think of it as a chance to take a glimpse into a point in history, and see it as some of those who lived it did, then I think you will be impressed.Many people may think that the obscenity of some of the interactions was overdone for effect. But whatever anyone's personal judgment of that behavior, that is the closest portrayal of Marines (or soldiers) being themselves I have yet seen on screen. Marines are vulgar. They do watch porn. They do fight among themselves. They do both hate, and love, the Marine Corps. There is an omni-present anti-war conspiracy theorist. The do say ridiculous things. There are some who are over the line. The reality of the Marine Infantry is that things happen there every day that are well beyond conventional sensibility, and which strain credibility to the average civilian. It's all true. I love the Marine Corps and I am still serving - I don't have an axe to grind. It just happens to be true.Are there parts of the film that I find incredible? Yes. But they are not the essential things. There is a scene, it's even in the trailer, in which everyone is firing their weapon into the air. I wasn't there, but I can't fathom a breach of discipline on that scale. I can't say it's impossible, but I am doubtful. But whether it's true or not is not important. At its essence this is a film about Marines, how they adjusted to the Marine Corps, each other, and a war. If there are a few incredible details, then we can just be grateful that Hollywood didn't impose a car-chase on us.This is a film about Marines. At that time, there were very few who turned down scholarships to Ivy League schools to come in. We were from strange backgrounds. We were obscene. We did want to get our kills. Many of us were frustrated that our war was only 100 hrs long. We knew we were filling the footsteps of giants - the Marines of Iwo, The Chosin, Belleau Wood - and I think we all wanted a chance to earn a place next to those men. In our wild, adrenalized youth, those aspirations just took the crude form of looking for a kill. Or at least that's how I've put it in perspective 15 years later.If you go and see this film, try to recall yourself at 18 (as I was). Suspend your judgment of the obscenity and vulgarity until you're sure you would've done it differently. I can't speak for Swofford, but I am still incredibly proud of my service there. The insanity of this film reminds me why: because it is characteristic of the immense hardship that our youth bears on behalf of the rest. Do the characters look stressed? It's not hyperbole. We were 18 and we thought we were going to die over there. Still, at H-Hour, everyone marched North. In my opinion, you better fill some big shoes before you judge that.So don't go into this film champing at the bit to pigeon-hole it as ""Anti"" or ""Pro"" war, with all the pre-fab rhetoric that comes with such a judgment. You have an opportunity here to look back into our little moment in history. Swofford has invited you into our memories. They are not Right, and they are not Left, they are just our story as Swofford lived it. If that kind of thing interests you, then go and see this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Like collective insanity,"I have never been in the military, so I can only guess as to home realistic this film is. But one thing that startled me was how close to insanity the various Marines were in this film. One minute, one of them would seem pretty normal and the next they'd be losing their minds. This happened again and again to practically all the soldiers in the film...even the leading man, Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal)!The story follows Swofford from a brief scene in boot camp to his advanced training to eventual deployment in Kuwait during the Gulf War. All during which, he and his fellow Marines were all just a few steps away from completely losing their minds.This is not a pleasant film to watch, but I liked that the story was NOT sanitized....it was nasty, ugly, and, most interestingly, focused on how incredibly boring and uneventful the war was for the average grunt. It also focuses on the emotional damage incurred by these men. Quite interesting if not enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pleasantly surprising,"I saw a promotional screening of the film, sponsored by my university. Following the screening was an audience Q&A with the author (and main character), Tony Swofford.And it was no surprise that the very first question from the audience was, quite ambiguously, ""Do you support the military?"" When Swofford dismissed the question as too broad and complex to be answered with a simple yes or no, the inquirer followed up with, ""Well, do you support the war?"" Swofford dismissed this even more readily.To me, this was perfectly representative of how the film handled its potential political implications.As Troy says early on in the film, ""To hell with politics. We're here now."" And that's essentially how the movie went.It bypasses the soapbox and simply tells you how it was, from the perspective of a single soldier. And while the opening boot camp scenes may seem like Full Metal Jacket Lite, the rest of the film is truly unique.Sam Mendes directs with his usual brilliance, showing once again his affinity for bright, vivid color, even in the largely monochromatic desert.Jake Gyllenhaal gives an excellent performance as Anthony Swofford, complemented by the able talents of Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgaard.The film's only real flaw is that, like the war on which it was based, it's pretty slow, and not a lot really happens.In the strictest sense, I would have a hard time even classifying this as a war film, and it's certainly not a deliberately political film.But in its own way, it tells an intense, personal story. Beyond that, you're simply left to make your own judgments.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Full Metal Witch Project,"Just saw an advanced screening of this tonight. While it isn't the film that has been so brilliantly advertised, it's a very solid film. It feels a lot like ""Full Metal Jacket"" early on, but with more humor. Then, it becomes an entirely new animal. More of a psychological study. I would actually call this the ""Blair Witch Project"" of war films in that you (and the characters) know the Boogeyman's ""out there,"" you're just waiting for him to strike. And the longer you wait, the more stir-crazy you become within your own mind.The acting is superb and the cinematography is stellar. It's an anti-war film without being distinctly liberal about it. It's a true story, and for the most part, Mendes tells it like it is. So, you can make your own judgment about it. But based off what you see, and all that happens, you have no choice but see the absurdity, not only in war, but perhaps in some of the USMC's tactics as well. It's heartbreaking to see what an experience like this can do to young men.If you're looking for action, this is not the film you're looking for. No heroism, judgments, insight, or hope. Just the documentation and reflection of build up, the destruction of lives, psychological torment, boredom, camaraderie, and...waiting.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
a worthy effort but seems to be lacking,"Gritty story based on the true life experiences of Marine recruit Anthony Swofford, a naïve teenager who gets more than he bargained for beginning in basic training, then a long and hellish nightmare of combat after he's shipped off to Kuwait during Operation Desert Shield. Well-crafted, strongly acted, and extremely political the film certainly holds your interest, but the script is unfocused, the subject matter never truly compelling, and the momentum slows more and more as it goes along. Gyllenhaal is respectable as the reluctant Marine who finds himself in over his head, while Foxx is a powerhouse as his gung-ho sergeant. Starts off strongly, but gradually becomes conventional and loses its way. **½",,Anonymous,Biography
A different war movie...,"""Jarhead"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch a group of men who were selected to become snipers. After their training they were sent to take part in Gulf War. There they face many difficulties and they have to cope with the feeling of missing everyone and homesickness.I liked this movie because it was different from the other war movies I have seen although it reminded me in some moments Stanley Kubrick's movie ""Full Metal Jacket"" which is a masterpiece. The direction which was made by Sam Mendes was very good and he presented very well the struggles of marines for their hard training to their operations in Gulf War. He also showed the other face of war, the true face of soldiers when they are prepared to go to war and when they are at war. Regrading the interpretations of the movie, Jake Gyllenhaal who played as Anthony Swofford was for one more time simply amazing, Jamie Foxx who played as Staff Sgt. Sykes was equally good and Peter Sarsgaard who played as Alan Troy made a very interesting interpretation. If you want to watch a different kind of war movie without the stereotypes of it, then just watch this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The life of soldiers during the Gulf War when the invasion of Kuwait by Sadan Hussein's Iraqi troops took place.,"In 1989, Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) is getting trained in a U. S. Marine Corps boot camp by the choleric, hard-boiled Drill Instructor Fitch (Scott MacDonald). After finishing boot camp, ""Swoff"" is dispatched to Camp Pendleton. Anthony Swofford talks us through his Marine training and service in 1991 Gulf War, is also about an institutionalised man in existential meldown. Anthony is approached by Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx), a Marine ""lifer"" who invites Swofford to his Scout Sniper course. He is selected to be trained as a sniper and paired with his roommate Troy (Peter Sarsgaard), who becomes Swofford's spotter. Every man fights his own war !. Welcome To The Suck !This is the story of a 20-year-old boy in the war of Iraq, a life that has little to do with what the newspapers and television offered. It's not often that a film captures exactly what it must have been like for a person to live through the Gulf War as a soldier, but Jarhead partially succeeds. The focus is on a youth who yearns to do what's expected -Are we ever going to get kill anyone ?. The movie's strong suit is vagueness, presenting combat as a semi-surreal state of ignorant expectation and dislocated experience. These warriors loll in the desert awaiting action or attempting to make sense of its consequences. Apart from a few caustic asides about oil and censorship there's barely a glance at life outside the barracks let alone any contemporary resonance.It is contemporary war seen from the surface with the images of oil wells burning in the night, like comets fallen from the sky, there were recruits laughing and reveling, and full of enthusiasm, and at the same time frightened by the idea that the battle could surprise them behind the next dune or hill. However, the infernal situation in which they live is compensated with their eternal loyalties, camaraderie that nothing could break, unlikely friendships, creating a brotherhood of 'Jarheads' who have sworn eternal fidelity. A gripping and powerful story packed with hard-hitting experiences , drama comedy and many swearings and bad language.Well starred by Jake Gyllenhaal who began his film career with ¨City Slickers¨ by Ron Underwood. After that, he made ¨Donnie Darko¨, ¨Bubble Boy¨, the drama ¨Moonlight mile¨, a disaster film: ¨The day after tomorrow¨and the interesting thriller ¨Zodiac¨. Achieving his greatest success with the highly awarded ¨Brokeback Mountain¨for which he obtained an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. He's well accompanied by a good cast such as: Peter Sarsgaard, Scott MacDonald, Jamie Foxx, Lucas Black, Kevin Foster, Brian Geraghty, Dennis Haybert and Chris Cooper.This wartime picture was well directed by Samuel Alexander Mendes , though with no too much originaly. Sam Mendes was born in the United Kingdom as part of his family of Portuguese descent. In 1996 he filmed ""Company"" for television, a musical by Stephen Sondheim. Thanks to his admiration for his adaptation of ¨Cabaret¨ music. Which won several Tony Awards, Spielberg gave him the opportunity to begin a film career when DreamWorks produced American Beauty in 1999, winner of the Oscar for best picture and best director. Sam Mendes is a good director who has made some successful films played by important actors , such as : Jarhead , American Beauty , Revolutionary road , this Road to perdition and two Bond movies : Skyfall and Spectre . Rating: 6.5/10 . Above average. Well worth watching . Essential and indispensable watching for Jake Gyllenhaal fans.The saga Jarhead is made up of: ¨Jarhead¨ (2005) by Sam Mendes with Jake Gyllenhaal, Scott MacDonald, Peter Sarsgaard, Jamie Foxx, Lucas Black. ¨Jarhead: Field of fire¨(2014) by Don Michael Paul with Cole Hauser, Stephen Lang, Bokeem Woodbine, Esai Morales , Jesse Garcia, Jason Wong, Josh Kelly.¨Jarhead: The siege¨ (2016) by William Kaufman with Scott Adkins, Charlie Weber, Dante Basco , Romeo Miller, Erik Valdez, Sasha Jackson, Dennis Haysbert. ¨Jarhead: Law of Return¨ (2019) with Devon Sawa, Amaury Norlasco, Amos Taman, Nicholas Aaron, Robert Patrick .",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A true and realistic story,"As someone who is in the military, I thought this movie was perfect. If you are looking for a message about war or politics you won't find it here. This movie is strictly a story told by the main character about his time serving in the Marine Corps and his tour in the Gulf. It is true to life. From the language, situations, to the way the characters interact, the film is right on with accuracy.The film is shot with striking cinematography. Scenes in the desert, especially with the oil fires, are breathtaking. The shots are done perfectly and originally throughout while the score and soundtrack takes it to a powerful emotional level.The film will receive bad reviews from a political standpoint. I read a couple before I saw the movie that all stated they didn't like the movie because it had no message or stance. To that I say good. It was refreshing to see a movie as a movie. I was glad that it was just a story, and there wasn't any motivation underneath it. That's not to say that the movie is one dimensional. There are many undertones, just none of which are attempting to reassert or defame the current war in the East.See this film if you want to see a humorous, sad, psychotic, intense, and most importantly REAL story.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great performance from Jake Gyllenhaal,"Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a Sacramento kid who enlists in the Marines. The audience is taken along through his training, and then the first Gulf War starts. He's in the middle of it all, but it's a struggle to maintain his sanity in an insane situation.It's a compelling and fascinating story based on the real Anthony Swofford's book. The training provide some memorable moments. The deployment gets strange. It's the actual war that's where this movie is unusual. Most war movie is about the bang bang. This one is about the search and longing for the bang bang. Like the disappointment that Swofford must have felt, I think the audience also feels that disappointment in the film.Jake Gyllenhaal gives an amazing performance. Director Sam Mendes achieves exactly what the experience is about. The movie leaves you feeling empty and a little haunted. It makes you wonder if everybody wasted their time.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Here's a simple guide to Jarhead, without an agenda.","I am not a professional writer, I am not a director, I am not important. I just enjoy movies. I'm not writing this to convince you of my opinion. I'm not even here to give you a professional review of this movie, or sound educated and witty. I'm here to give a layman's take on the movie and not be concerned with politics or agendas.1: Cinematography is downright beautiful in this movie. There are some unforgettable shots. Easily a contender for this year's cinematography award.2: This is not an action war movie. If you want it to be, find another movie. Black Hawk Down might be closer to what you're looking for, although finding an action movie about Desert Storm is kind of hard.3: This movie will invoke emotions. And just about any person can pick out a lot of evidence to support why they liked it and why they did not. A person can pick out a lot of evidence supporting the military, and at times make it look like a recruiting tool, or it can show anti war, anti-Bush, anti everything. It will make those that like to argue and takes sides, have a wonderful time with it.4: The acting is good and realistic. It shows the happy carefree side of war, and also the darker undertones, and not-so-under-toned evils of war.5: The military prepares people to become soldiers, just like a coach prepares people to become athletes. And once you are one, it is hard to switch it off once a person goes back to normal life. Even quote/ unquote ""desk jockey's"" and those that aren't in the actual combat but provide support roles, are still trained to fight.6: Media and movies have not helped our perception of war and those involved. They've been putting a spin on things for a while now, and they like to beat a lot of dead horses.7: This is based on a true story. No matter how ""Hollywoodized"" a movie can get, it's basic concepts and ideas are still generally intact. And Swoff was actually there. I was not.8: To me, Jarhead felt like the Full Metal Jacket of this generation. With extreme's of both ""anti's"" and ""pro's"" you take it or leave it. Full Metal Jacket is a good movie for taking the approach that it did. Jarhead is no different.9: Don't hate on anyone trying to do their job, if you see someone in uniform, don't think negatively or positively, unless you know the person. You don't know their story. If you want to find out, just listen. That's all, nothing more. Don't just wait for your next chance to speak.10: Find a way to see Jarhead, reserve your judgments until afterward, and if you're a jerk, then give all the snotty, ignorant, or mean opinions you want. You won't change anyone's mind, just tick them off.To finish up, this movie will make you feel something. Let it go. No wonder people's stress levels are high. If you offend easily, lighten up. If all you can do is go around in life and get offended, then I am truly sorry for you. Now, I'm going to grab a beer from the fridge, sit down and watch a movie, to have something to do. Nothing more.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
From a Marine from that era,"At last - a movie that simply shows it like it is... No ""Rambo"" superhero-idiotic-nonsense; no overdone, melancholy, attempt at cinematic artistry at the cost of authenticity - such as is found in ""Platoon"", ""FMJ"", ""Apocalipse Now"" and ""Deerhunter"" - to name a few overrated war movies.Finally a movie which captures the FEEL of being a Marine in the eighties... the sights, the sounds, the events - all brought back vivid memories. As the scenes unfolded, I found myself thinking ""... I remember when that happened..."" over and over, because my service somewhat paralleled Swofford's own, and I was aware of - if not a witness to - certain events that took place. A movie which portrays the Marine grunt for what he is... certainly no angel, but the absolute backbone of American military toughness. The barracks and field life portrayed in this movie is perhaps the most accurate portrait Hollywood has produced.With only a few realtively minor technical inaccuracies, this is a movie whose full richness can probably only be experienced by those who were in the Corps at that time. And for that degree of accuracy, I am grateful to the author and those who produced the film. Too often producers and directors overlook the details that make a military film credible to veterans - such as the details of the uniform, the sounds and function of weapons, the behavior of the characters. Not so in ""Jarhead"". And the dialogue was right on.Having read several of the other comments, it is clear to me that there are events depicted in the movie which may not be clearly understood or properly contextualized by someone who has not served in the Marine Corps infantry. Do not let that stop you from seeing the film - it is an excellent view into a world most people will never see. I left the theater feeling proud of my service, and although I miss the daily life of an active duty Marine, ""Jarhead"" left me feeling strangely happy to be able to look back on it - and to sleep in my own home, my own bed, tonight. Yet, for many Marine veterans, the hope remains in the back of our minds that the phone will ring tomorrow with an opportunity to go back and lead men once again - and yes, for those who might wonder, even in Iraq or anywhere else - as the line in the move so eloquently put it ""Forget the politics. We're here now."" Such is the fidelity of a rough-hewn few who are ready to fight when called upon. Grunts really don't expect most people to love us or understand us, but we hope there are some folks out there who might appreciate the fact that we are there. I think the movie captures that notion commendably.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Trained for war,"Jarhead is based n the memoirs of the real Anthony Swofford and his time in the
United States Marines. Jake Gyllenhaal. When you're trained for war the hardest
thing sometimes to do is stand and wait.Which was what back in the early 90s the Marines and the rest of the coalition sat
and waited in Saudi Arabia for about 6 months. Days when being cool meant
the temperature was only in double digits fahrenheit.Gyllenhaal is not the most gung ho marine out there. In fact during basic he
scrapes by. But the man can shoot and Sergeant Jamie Foxx thinks he would
be good for special sniper training.Gyllenhaal is something of an intellectual and a Marine barracks is not a place
where one usually finds them. But the memoirs of Anthony Swofford in this
time provide a nice insight into these troops trained for war and finding no
outlet.Jarhead might be the film concerning Desert Shield and Desert Storm.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

personal opinion of Jarhead,"Ladies and gents, I saw the movie very recently and as a Viet Nam era Marine I was particularly disgusted and had alternating feelings between going home and burning everything I had that referred to our Corps or just getting up and asking for my money back (which is what I ended up doing). None of us are perfect but if the portrayal of the Marines in this picture is accurate; we should get together, disband the current USMC and disperse the men and women to the appropriately tasked ""other armed forces"" and let our Marine Corps fade into history. We always had the ""ten per-centers"" that bitched and moaned about everything and didn't hold their end but to glorify the crap I saw on the screen in ""Jarhead"" this month - bull!

High-gripping war drama which is different in terms of story-telling,"JarHead was one the most riveting war-drama that is bold and yet sympathizing.Based on former Marine Anthony Swofford's best-selling 2003 book , Jarhead tells about the experiences of Swofford while going through rigorous military training in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.From the director of American Dream , Sam Mendes brings you a very powerful drama about the frustration and anger experienced by an army man away from family , away from home and away from your loved ones. It portrays the picture of pre-experiences of a soldier in the military camp and how he struggles to fight for the country. Direction is incredible but looses the steam later. Wish the second half would have been more impacting. Screenplay is decent. Cinematography is world-class , art direction and dialogues are good. Editing is loose. Jake Gylanhall is superb as Marin Swofford. He is one of most underrated actor. He emotes effectively through his eyes and has given a brave performance. Jamie Foxx and Peter Saarsgaard lends good support.Overall , high-gripping war drama which is different in terms of story- telling. Good 3/5",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Military Hollywood Style and Ripoff of Full Metal Jacket,"I've been in the military for almost two decades now and have never seen a more ridiculous representation than this foolish but somewhat entertaining movie.This movie is little more than a poor ripoff of the excellent, well acted, finely directed ""Full Metal Jacket."" That's really all there is to say other than the fact that the Hollywood kabal has struck again in its attempt to denigrate American soldiers and portray them as a bunch of savage morons.As an aside, have you noticed that since the terrorist attack of 911, the media folks on the left coast have been too cowardly to produce a movie about Arab terrorism? They are now held up as as innocents exploited by America.Maybe they're afraid that one of them will place a bomb in their autos. Or just maybe, they feel that they can make more money in overseas sales by denigrating a military that has been the historical guarantor of their own liberty and right to be irresponsible.6 out of 10 because I managed to sit through the whole thing.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
What did I see?,"I love movies because they often pull emotions out that I rarely experience in real life. I watch Jarhead thinking it would either anger me or make me sad. Yet, despite many intense situations, the movie left me emotionally blank.The acting was well done. The story was interesting. Yet, at the end of the movie, I was numb. Not numb as in ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""We Were Soldiers"" numb ... just emotionally ambivalent. The movie does not overtly take sides, and straddling that line may have diminished the effect on the viewer.Perhaps by not serving in the military, I missed something, but that is why I like to watch movies about war. One thing Jarhead did do is give me an additional respect for the sacrifices soldiers make for their country.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Every War Movie is Different.  Every War Movie is the Same.,"More than anyone, I would imagine that U.S. Soldiers would have a more specific opinion of this film than anyone else. They were there, they were in it, no one knows better than they.And there are two kinds of soldiers: those who loved it, who took great pride and honor in serving their country... and those who saw it as just a job, got out, and got on with their lives. ""Jarhead"" is based on a book, written by a U.S. Marine, who falls squarely into the second category.He does not judge, he does not come out as for or against the war. This is not a political movie, yet will still make some people uncomfortable, and it should. ""Jarhead"" lays out the experience of one particular Marine from boot camp, to (suddenly) Operation Desert Shield, to Operation Desert Storm. What happens here is not always pretty, but it is the truth, and the truth should be all we can ask for.The screenplay was adapted by William Broyles Jr., who in addition to some TV work, adapted the recent ""Planet of the Apes"" remake, and ""Cast Away."" Personally, I didn't think either of these films were anything special, which is why ""Jarhead"" is such a surprise. Not a lot blows up, there's no huge siege like in your typical Vietnam movie... it's a surprisingly affecting study of this one man, the experiences he had, the people he knew. It's about the Corps, and it's about brotherhood. Our main character, Swof, never judges, never mentions politics, is only the best Marine that he knows how to be.As Swof's friend Troy says at one point, ""F*** politics. We're here. All the rest is bull****."" Which is all the movie is about, really. This is what happened. Take it or leave it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Harsh Reality,"The old war movies are so simple. Our heroes are eventually going to meet that adversary and finish the issue. This is a film about the boredom, the alienation, the disconnectedness that takes place in wartime. The men in this film are hung out to dry in the desert. Remember the first gulf war was fought mostly with high tech weapons and bombing runs. Of course, there were ground casualties and close fighting in some places, but this film is more about the tension that develops when those with their fingers on the triggers are made to stand down. I think the most gripping part of the film is when the oil fields are burning a and sludgy rain of oil ash and black particles rain from the sky. These guys suffocate on this. It's like a plague from the Bible. All they can do is trudge through it. There is much more to this film, but the bottom line is what the heck is the enemy and what do we poor soldiers have to do to confront it? The answer in this case is to wait and see.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
definitely not what i was expecting,"i was hoping for a more gung ho war movie, but i wasn't disappointed either. one of my friends said it was nothing like the book so keep your socks on book readers. there were some dissatisfying moments in the movie, no actual fire fights but they get darn close. Id say this movie is lot more about what it is to be a soldier. On the side though its about the relationship with his girlfriend but in the end its really about his compadres. Jarhead provoked some raw emotions and will have anyone that is familiar in the military life going ""damn its straight up my alley."" Though i must say that the scenes were pretty cool, its not a movie i would buy when it came out on DVD. It had some good home grown not for kids humor which i like, but definitely not what you want innocent kiddies to watch.

"Jarhead, a very compelling film","I was privileged to see a screening of Jarhead recently and fully concur with the posted review. I think it is one of the finer films of the year. The film will surely be a very controversial piece of cinema especially in these divisive post 9/11, ""America love it or love it times"". It's a shame because the film has less to do with the politics of war then the unique personalities that made up a specific platoon of Marines in the first Gulf War. The title of the film derives from Anthony Swofford's very compelling novel about his adventures, a book that in no way demeans the heroism of the young men (and now young women) who live and die in the military. Thankfully, the director, Sam Mendes works for a very even-handed screenplay by William Broyles Jr. Thankfully, Jarhead lacks the jingoist simplicity of earlier offerings like The Sands of Iwo Jima and is not another display of sincere but ultimately faux patriotism like a John Wayne offering. It simply tells it like it was. It is a very fine film that will assure Sam Mendes' position as one of the great directors working in films. Broyle's screenplay is excellent and the ensemble of young actors led by Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Foxx and Peter Sargaard is wondrous. Now the wait is on for an equally compelling work on the current military campaign in Iraq.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Entertaining for a while, but where's the needed release?","Jarhead - slang for Marine. It describes the high and tight haircut that resembles a jar. The movie follows one such Jarhead's (Bubble Boy's Jake Gyllenhaal) experiences as a Marine from boot camp to training to Desert Shield to Desert Storm. We watch as the war swells from 14 minutes and 5000 troops in the desert to 175 days and 575,000 troops in the desert.The Marine's labor? They wait. The movie audience's labor? We wait. For something, anything to happen. The soldiers make scorpions fight each other and they bet on who will win. They dance around naked to Naughty by Nature's OPP. I nearly vomit. They pull pranks. They wait for letters. They get bored. Very bored.I hesitate to call Jarhead a ""war movie"" because it has little to do with the actual war. It focuses more on how the soldiers try to fight their boredom while waiting for some action. This is an interesting take ... up to a point. But after a while the audience starts to become as frustrated as the Marines. These guys want to kill. They trained to kill! An exasperated Gyllenhaal even asks, ""Are we ever going to get to kill anybody?"" I was wondering the same thing. I wanted to see a little fighting. Maybe a cool sniper kill or two. Just like the soldiers, I wanted some release.Maybe it was the director's intention to put the audience in the shoes of the weary soldiers. If so, then mission accomplished. The problem with this approach is that it hampers the storytelling. There's no smooth flow to the narrative. After a while you're left wondering if there is a point other than, ""Hey, there were some soldiers who didn't see much action and they got bored!"" As such, Jarhead feels like a dramatized documentary.I was a little concerned that the movie would be a big political statement, but it stays away from trying to polarize its audience. Any parallel lines drawn between then and now are subtle and temperate. Some guys wanted in, some wanted out, and some just looked like they had nothing better to do. One of my favorite moments comes when Booty Call's Jamie Foxx talks about how there's nothing more he wants to do than be a Marine. This scene, set against the backdrop of the dark desert lit by burning oil fields, is a great visual to behold.But ultimately I never got the release or the closure that I was waiting for. Instead of sending the audience home on a high note, the director tempts us to slit our wrists at the revelation of the post-war fate of one of the main characters. We're not told how this character came to his fate, though I have my assumption, but the ""how"" doesn't matter. No explanation would dilute the depression that we're left with.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
They Said Field Fun!,"Greetings again from the darkness. The kiss of death for a movie is walking into the theater expecting to see a great film. Director Sam Mendes is putting together a good resume with the solid ""The Road to Perdition"" and the great ""American Beauty"". What he has is an eye for is the shot. What he is missing is the gift of storytelling.Based around Desert Shield/Storm, ""Jarhead"" focuses on Marine Swofford played to the fullest by Jake Gyllenhaal. The frustration, isolation and periodic bouts of lost sanity are explored as soldiers are trained and then shipped off to sit around in the blazing desert. ""When do we get to kill somebody?"" is a recurring theme and is one of many political left wing propaganda statements attempted by the film (others include faulty equipment, protection drugs, staged interviews, etc). Sadly, the film is neither a true anti-war picture or a real psycho-probe of soldiers. It toys with both and fails with both.Peter Sarsgaard is the most effective of the actors although his relationship with Gyllenhaal is a pinball that is impossible to follow. Are they friends or rivals? I would like to know when and how they supposedly got so close.The true magic in this film is at the hand of the marvelous cinematographer, Roger Deakins (""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Shawshank Redemption"" and most every Cohen Brothers film). The visuals in the battlefields and desert as well as the claustrophobia of cramped quarters and protective suits are the only reasons the film works at all. We can feel the heat from the burning oil wells and smell the nastiness of latrine duty as well as the sliminess of crude oil rain on the face. Masterful.Jamie Foxx, Chris Cooper and Dennis Haysbert are all effective in their roles, but overall the film just is missing a soul. Very disappointing that there is no clear direction or story or plot so the film never reaches the great level it obviously aspires to.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Portrait of the War Inside,"Sam Mendes approach at the war in Iraq isn't rancid neither inaccurate. It's lateral. Wheter you expect tons of action or tons of emotions, you will get in between of them. The movie explores the lack of dynamism in the Eastern Front and how the war is liberated by the Phsycological road and the manipulation of fears is of upper relevance.Performances are visceral and passionate, smart and felt. Jake Gylleenhall does his work in a bloody good manner. Saarsgad brings the spiritual contrast into scene with a cynicism that is largely well acted. Jamie Foxx brings to scene a life style that dominates the front: a life style in which vital is the adrenaline and no matter how much sand, oil or walking in an empty desert may despair, he goes front to his patriotic spirit, with his wit and grown loyalty to his team.The movie revolves into the idea of what happens between the recruits when there is no action and one has to always be prepared. What goes on when nothing goes on? In a place that violent and filled of turmoil, the tension appears as fast as it vanishes. The tension is dealt in the mind, with the well drawn characters fight together with the common fear: War, Death.A good movie, that approaches war at a different angle. I took a good surprise at seeing it.""We are the hammer of God and that hammer is falling down""",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Vietnam Vet On The bus,"I don't think many people caught the meaning of the Vietnam Vet in the biker vest who asked to sit for a moment on the bus. For returning Vietnam Vets there wasn't much celebration but rather an isolated trip back into anonymity. For that brief moment, the Vietnam Vet saw and felt what he should have years earlier... affirmation and recognition. I am sure it was an intended (and embedded) allusion to that injustice. For me, it hit a chord of sadness I didn't know I had. For that moment in the movie I was riding that same bus... along with thousands of other veterans.

JARHEAD's Dogs of War,"The first Gulf War in Iraq has been an occasional subject matter of films, but not until Jarhead has a bona fide story emerged which captures the experience and heartache as told by director Sam Mendes. Although Mendes has never been able to match the heights of American Beauty, he does an effective job of making the audience a participant in the rigors of desert warfare.Raw recruits are thrust into rough, basic training (at times with tragic results) as they are prepared for duty in Iraq. Among them are Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Troy (Peter Sarsgaard). Drill Sgt. Siek (Jamie Foxx) whips the young men into soldiers as they are deployed in the Persian Gulf with the imminent threat of war. This is a rough life with constant humiliation and hazing. Then comes Operation Desert Shield with the endless training, waiting, monotony, and more time away from family and home where wives and girlfriends lose touch or stray. Such is the hapless life of the grunt. A hostile terrain such as dirty oil fields adds to the isolation and need for rebellious acts to mitigate frustration. Swofford and Troy are groomed to be snipers, and when their opportunity comes in Operation Desert Storm, they are more than ready until they are dealt an unexpected turn of events.The recurring phrase or motif in the film is ""Welcome to the suck."" That about sums up what these men are put through. Adapted by William Broyles Jr. from Swofford's own real life experiences, it is an uncompromising recreation of 'the suck'. Mendes is content to show you what it was like but never dwells on any one scene longer than needed to get his point across.Told essentially from his point of view, the film opens and closes with a telling monologue by Swofford that sums up his experience. He and Troy form the nucleus of the film's conscience and soul. Swofford made the mistake of signing up while Troy is the ironic soldier who wants to fight a war but is thwarted by bureaucracy. The film does ring true in its depiction of the preparation for warfare with the heavy toll it takes on the soldiers and their personal lives. Periodically, an on screen tag will appear to list the number of days the surging numbers of troops were in Iraq (5000 troops increases to 575,000 troops in 175 days), which helps put the events in perspective. This film demythologizes war and instead presents war as a difficult and often life changing experience resulting not from actual combat, but from the tedium and loneliness.It is important to note that although Swofford shows a dislike for this man's army, he continues to do as he is told. This apolitical film does not really take a stance on the war. We really don't get enough background on Swofford or Troy to understand what makes these men tick. Rather, we are left with what they experience and how they respond on a superficial level. Troy comes across as inconsistent and his motivations are questionable. While the evolution of their relationship doesn't always make sense, the film still packs an emotional punch. About two-thirds through, the film's momentum begins to lose some steam and direction. There is also a sad event toward the end that is never fully explained.Gyllenhaal (Proof, Donnie Darko) is showing good maturity as an actor, and Sarsgaard (Kinsey) is effective as his closest buddy. Jamie Foxx (Ray) registers quite convincingly as the leader of this bunch. Dennis Haysbert and Chris Cooper have short but effective moments as commanding officers with axes to grind.Although movies have been set in the Iraqi conflict like Three Kings, this film deals directly with the soldiers who must do the dirty work. In some ways this film shares a pedigree with an ensemble piece like Battleground. There are allusions to the Vietnam War particularly at the end involving a Vietnam veteran and also in clips from Vietnam movies like Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter. The early drills recall some of the most harrowing moments from Full Metal Jacket with the verbal insults and discipline. In fact, some of the vicious lines are hysterically funny. It's certainly a far cry from An Officer and Gentlemen. Like the soldiers at the beginning of Born on the Fourth of July, they go in wide eyed, full of optimism, and ready for action. Instead, what they find is something that beats their spirits down. In a way, the structure of vignettes and random incidents is similar to The Big Red One without the periodic voice-over. Pop songs of the era are matched perfectly to scenes. Technical aspects are good including the camera work and editing. There are some memorable images including an eerie scene where the patrol comes upon a charred caravan of vehicles with burned, Iraqi people.Jarhead is not a perfect film, but it is well acted and pulls no punches on what it must have been like in Iraq. Those looking for an action packed war film will be severely disappointed and let down. Except for some character inconsistencies, it is a realistic study in the psychological toll that military life takes on a human being.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not a John Wayne Movie,"""Every war is different,"" says Anthony Swofford as the movie ""Jarhead"" comes to a close. ""Every war is the same."" Looking back on his experience, he sees that the first Gulf War and the Marine Corps have become ineradicable parts of who he is: ""Every jar-head is me."" The screen shimmers and shifts into a scene of a desert patrol dwarfed by distance and hazed by heat waves. ""We are still in the desert,"" he says. The screen darkens. The credits begin to roll.A critic once observed that audiences emerge from a comedy talking animatedly with one another, but after a tragedy they come forth subdued and solitary, each absorbed by his or her own thoughts.""Jarhead"" is not a tragedy but a tragic coming-of-age story. As in ""The Last Picture Show,"" a young man discovers what a cruel, destructive business life can be. Swofford emerges from a war that has consisted of a long, maddening wait followed by a hard march through the surreal aftermath of battles already won by jets dropping smart bombs, toward a horizon blackened by Saddam's burning oil wells. He returns home to find that his girlfriend has left him for another man. His best friend, who suffered with him through the combat that never came, dies as a civilian, possibly a suicide, as he was thrown out of the Corps with a dishonorable discharge.Subdued and solitary, I waited outside the theater for my wife.""So, what did you think?"" I asked her when she came out. ""Definitely not a John Wayne movie,"" she said. ""No,"" I responded, reminded of Clint Eastwood sharing a victory cigar with a young Marine beneath an American flag raised atop a hill in Grenada in ""Heartbreak Ridge.""""It wasn't as dark as the book,"" I said. ""In the book,"" she replied, ""you couldn't see Swofford's smile.""Jake Gyllenhaal does display an engaging, youthful grin in the early part of the movie. He plays the twenty-year-old Swoff very well. And Jamie Foxx does Sgt. Sykes brilliantly. Against the backdrop of a night made at once hellish and spectacular by blazing oil wells, the Sergeant tells Swoff that he (Sykes) could have joined his brother and had a nice safe job stateside, but with no chance to see such sights as this. ""I love this job,"" he says. ""I thank God for every day he gives me in the Corps. Oorah... You know what I mean, Swoff?"" Foxx's delivery is flat, point blank, neither sarcastic nor enthusiastic. He is an exhausted soldier giving himself a pep talk he scarcely believes in any longer. Get out your Oscar Nomination forms.At dinner we tried to recall what was book and what was movie. I did not remember the scene in which the soldiers are interviewed by a TV journalist from the book, but from Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket."" From ""Full Metal Jacket"" also, I believe, came the bizarre business of a soldier's sardonically making a corpse his buddy. The war-is-surreal-hell moral of the movie reminded me of Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" - a film the young jar-heads watch with sexual intensity in Mendez's movie. But the scene in which the soldiers sit down to enjoy a home movie one Marine's wife has made - of herself being humped by their next door neighbor - that, we all agreed, was in the book.I remember when ""Battle Cry"" came out in 1955. Unlike the Boy-Scout-clean soldiers of most WW II movies of that era, these Marines said Hell and Damn. And one of them actually shot the finger at some troops riding past - What a shocker!A Jacksonville, NC Daily News reporter interviewed several Marines from the local base who saw the movie. Excerpt:Their reviews seemed to be positive, especially concerning the portrayal of the relationship between Marines and how deployments and war are mostly about sitting around and waiting.""I thought it was good,"" said Lance Cpl. Richard Usher, 19, from Tampa, Fla. ""From what I know, it's accurate. They did say 'Oorah' way too much.""Lance Cpl. Josh Rader, 29, of Georgia, said he thought the movie was one of the more accurate portrayals of the Marine Corps, with the only more accurate movie being Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket.""""A lot of the training, they dramatize it more,"" Rader said. ""I'd say it's probably more accurate.""Lance Cpl. Adam Blades, 20, with 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines, agreed, but took exception to the actors' ages.""The actors were a little old,"" he said.

THEY GOT THAT RIGHT!,"""Jarhead""'s depiction of the hellish ambience under the oil fires is utterly accurate. In fact, the gloaming that the Marines march through on film was just as dark and just as eerie during the actual operation- midnight or midday. As a veteran of all three campaigns in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operation, I sincerely appreciate the filmmakers' close attention to historical detail.

Extremely powerful and moving War pic. A 'Platoon' for Gen X.,"I saw this movie at a screening at UC Berkeley. Afterward the author of the novel it is based on held a Q&A.This movie is a bit long, but so are most War films. It does, however, keep your attention the entire times.This film is not just a War film, it is able to seamlessly mix comedy and drama, with such issues as Mental health and even a bit of ennui.The characters are fully developed, each and everyone has an interesting story that is covered, briefly but perfectly. You get a broad spectrum of the kinds of men that go to war, what they left behind, and how it effects them when they return.The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and Sam Mendes' direction is pitch perfect.Jakc Gyllenhaal gives an astounding performance, as does Jamie Foxx, but it is Peter Sarsgaard that steals the show, with a heartbreakingly subtle ghost of a performance.This is definitely a must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jarring,"Jarhead was a very well done war movie that is good but for the reasons you'd think. The story line covers before, during and after the life of a Marine but without much of an emphasis on the violence. It really honed in on the community, relationships, struggles, effects, etc. Of being a Marine and being deployed. It was really interesting to see a well done movie that captured that side of war while still being reasonably entertaining. Sure, it could have used some more action but that wasn't the point. Gyllenhaal delivered another amazing acting performance as well. Just a good watch overall.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
'Jarhead'The real 'suck',"In 1987, Time magazine ran an infamous cover that consisted of a marine in his dress blue uniformwith a blackened eye upon his face. The cover was intended to depict the shame befallen the marines after the Clayton Lonetree spy scandal and it was met with outragehow dare Time sucker-punch the entire Marine Corps because of the crimes of just one of its members? Yet after seeing the movie ""Jarhead,"" Anthony Swofford's autobiographical account of the marines during the first Gulf War, a black eye is the least of the marines' problems.The fundamental theme of Jarhead's portrayal of marine life is that heroes do not exist. One cannot depict the Marine Corps accurately without noting that at least some of its members perform feats of strength, endurance and bravery, and that to build an entire institution of such men, certain virtues are required. Yet like Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, a movie acclaimed for its supposed depiction of Viet Nam-era marines, none of these men and certainly none of these virtues are to be found.Instead, what one finds in Jarhead are empty men who drift though life, denied of what they truly want, and who choose to make up for it in emotional outbursts and sadistic and debased pleasures. Again and again, this is what Hollywood sees when it looks at the marines.Yet as far as I can tell, there's no massive backlash by marines against this moviein fact, I'm amazed at the positive reaction many marines have had. Are these marines so starved for heroesso hungered for a portrait of their lives in uniform that they will find merit with those who portray the character of their commitment as utterly bereft of meaning or purpose, simply because the actors put on a marine blouse or use a jargon that rings familiar?I served five years in the Marine Corps during the time Jarhead was set and I can certainly recount stories, both humorous and horrific. But overall, if I had to characterize my and my fellow marines' service, it would be the honorable commitment to the betterment of one's self and the defense of the American nation. The men I worked with might not have talked about it everyday. There might have been the occasional breach of conduct or character, and some may have even failed miserably in achieving the standard of excellence that is the hallmark of the corps.Yet overall,(and in the metaphysically significant sensethe only sense that matters in art) almost every marine I knew was in the corps for a purpose and that purpose was good, noble, and just.That's why I, for one, was proud to wear the marine uniform, and that's what no Hollywood movie that I know of has ever been able to accurately capture in a film about the marines. Given the freedoms the marines have fought so valiantly over their history to preserve, it's a tragedy they haven't received better from Hollywood in return.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just What Was The Point of This ?,"A lot of the dialogue ( This is my rifle etc ) and the boot camp intro seemed lifted from Full Metal Jacket. Even the fly nature of the main protagonist. But after half an hour I felt nostalgic for that old classic. This film was nowhere near as good. I seriously doubt indiscipline is this bad in the USMC. A lot more of them would get killed by accident. Or by their own side. The firing the guns into the air to the rap party backdrop was pure hokum. Why was knobhead (sorry jarhead )shown as being a Camus reader for all of five minutes, and then later shown to be a total moron for the rest of the film ? Sci Fi is accused of being all Science and with thin character development. This was a supposedly factual film, but despite that had 2D characters that were worthy of the worst Sci Fi. By the end I didn't care if any of them lived or died they were so irritating and boring.",,Anonymous,Biography
Directorial Similarities with Full Metal Jacket,"I watched this movie with interest, because there were so many directorial similarities with Full Metal Jacket. The stories and content of the two movies were different, of course, but in many ways ""Jarhead"" appeared to be a sort of directorial tribute to Stanley Kubrick's directorial tour de force, in Full Metal Jacket.The linguistic style of the main characters' narratives in both movies was similar. There were also similarities in the use of camera angles of the Marines in formation as they moved through combat areas; silhouette shots of Marines, with fire behind them; etc.This post should NOT be taken as a criticism, because many creative and innovative directors - such as Alfred Hitchcock and Fritz Lang - have been honored by other directors who may, from time to time, adapt certain stylistic techniques.Among the better directorial techniques was the use of subdued sepia tones to depict the monotony of day to day life in the desert.Overall, I thought the movie was a good one, although I would have liked to see a little backstory on some of the Marines in the group.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The politics of war,"I was fascinated by the indoctrination of the Marines before they were ever sent to war.It seems that they take great pains to build them into a unit that performs its mission without question.It was sad to see what happened when they were sent to Desert Storm. Over six months in the desert heat and nothing to show for it. Lives lost to friendly fire, marriages and relationships destroyed. An unending tale of disease from the atmosphere over there, and they never even used the training they received.This film had a lot of stars: Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Foxx, Peter Sarsgaard, Lucas Black, Chris Cooper, and Dennis Haysbert, but it wasn't about the characters, it was about the futility of it all. That makes it worthwhile viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hoorah!,"This wasn't a typical war movie as I expected, instead it sort of has the ""Full Metal Jacket"" vibe to it. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if this movie was influenced by that movie. At the start of the movie I thought it was going to be one of those dull war movies, but it got engaging really quick. It's based off the book, a true story written by Anthony Swofford, his life briefly﻿ before the enlisting, while in the Marines and after and overall it's a good movie. Jake Gyllenhaal did a good job but really started to impress me as the film went along and I liked his character as the film progressed as well. Jamie Foxx put on a great performance playing Staff Sgt. Sykes, slightly reminded me of a young Denzel Washington. I personally liked Peter Sarsgaard character, although his character is a bit of a prick but he is not as obnoxious as the rest of the team and straight to the point. The first 30 minutes was intriguing for the most part than it started to kill time by showing marines goofing off and doing random stuff during their free time, but I guess it showed the bonding aspect of it all. Some people bash on this movie for not having enough action for a war movie, and I know sometimes Drill Sergeants say stuff like ""Save the drama for your mama"". But this movie is more about the drama than the action, but it's still alright since it's kinda a manly drama. Plus I liked most of the dialogue in this movie. I just wished the impact of the film was as good as the beginning of it, cause the film started to lose it's momentum as it went along. It's basically a war movie with almost no death in it or at least you won't see people dying much, but has great character development for a war movie. Even if this movie isn't really focused on the subject matter like some reviewers claim, it's definitely worth watching, especially since you can get it at walmart for like $5 bucks.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Accomplished what it was trying to do.,"When I first watched Jarhead, I found it tediously slow. It lacked the action-packed sequences common to other war films. However, upon reflection, its strength lies in its authentic portrayal. While I haven't served in the military, the movie offers a raw glimpse into what I imagine the real experience is for many soldiers. It captures the mental toll, camaraderie, and tension-filled anticipation more than on-field action.

Not every single person who goes to war comes face to face nonstop with gunfire, bombs, or the enemy. This movie does a great job depicting the brotherhood that forms. It shows the endless days and nights of waiting for your peak moment of this huge war you thought you were going to face. It shows the way that life at home may continue full speed while you're away fighting for your country.It is definitely a good film, but it's not a typical action film or war movie. I don't want to say it's slow because I didn't feel it was, but it was very much like real life and when you compare real life to a Hollywood movie, of course your life is going to seem more slow paced.

Something that happen to me in the military. Its a topic not often brought up in War movies. But happens to military personal all the time who spend a good amount of time away from home. The other aspect that of the film i liked was the shots of the oil well fires. Pretty good cgi. I really thought this was filmed in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait.

A solid war piece.,"Compared to Sam Mendes' other works, this one lacks the really powerful acting and original storyline of American Beauty or Road to Perdition. Compared to other war films, however, it is still a strong piece that shows the obscurity and tediousness the Marines went through in the Gulf War. The cinematography is very good, with the scenes of burning oil being beautiful to look at. Overall, I thought this film was very neutral in its message. It isn't pro-war or anti-war. It simply shows what Anthony Swofford and other Marines went through and what they continue to go through after returning home.

If you hanker after John Wayne or Audie Murphy, you're in the wrong century.In ""Saving Private Ryan"", in my opinion, one of the top five films of all time, Sergeant Horvath says, at one point, that we might as well try to protect the bridge and save Ryan's ass because it might help make this whole war make some sense. If even fighting Hitler and the Nazis makes no sense on a day to day basis, how does liberating Kuwait make any sense?

It is this fact that causes the movie to lack the degree of originality requisite in a truly exceptional, unique production.

"Growing up he always wanted to do this, go to war and serve his country, but war is not what he imagined.","In 'Jarhead' Jake Gyllenhaal plays Anthony Swofford, a new marine recruit who is going to Iraq. Growing up he always wanted to do this, go to war and serve his country, but war is not what he imagined.This movie illustrates the actual events of Desert Storm through the eyes of Anthony Swofford. Anthony Swofford was a scout/sniper in a USMC platoon in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait during the Gulf War. His book 'Jarhead' tells the story of the events that happened to him and his fellow marines.Though I liked this film a lot, mostly for the realism, it did remind me too much of 'Platoon'. Unlike other war films, this movie is mostly uneventful, just like the war. This is what I think Swofford is trying to get across in his story. Here he is with his platoon, ready to fight, and they are not fighting. Casualties happen, from accidents mostly, but they do not get to fight.

Seven years ago, critics were probably lambasting The Thin Red Line for its nebulous and ill-defined story. TRL, however, is increasingly viewed as a classic. The same might not happen to Jarhead, but this is a movie better than its reviews. Maybe, owing to the cast and crew, as well as the subject matter, people expected too much.

Much of the film focuses on the ever-evolving relationships among the men in Swofford's unit, who at various times come across as psychopathic, sensitive, ignorant, insightful, crude, patriotic, self-indulgent, and just plain trying to get by. Swofford excels as a sharpshooter, and the film pays particular attention to his relationship with his spotter Troy (played by the always engaging Peter Sarsgaard) and his commanding officer Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx, also excellent).In many respects, the film is a success. Top-notch acting from Gyllenhaal, Sarsgaard, and Foxx. Amped up physicality and the perpetual potential for violence lend the proceedings an air not dissimilar to the films that it often references, especially Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket. It has a tremendously raw feel to it, from the profanity-laced tirades of basic training to the surreal patrols through burning deserts streaked with raining oil.Through it all, though the characters share bonding and destabilizing encounters with one another in a manner typical of the genre, the story refuses to follow any established formula. Characters most emphatically will NOT be learning great life lessons or developing the courage to stand up to their convictions or becoming deeply disillusioned by the horrors around them, nor will they come together to overcome tremendous obstacles. There will be no explicit commentary on the war that was fought then or the sequel that we are engaged in now. It's a story about life in the Marines, in all its ambiguity and with no attempt at putting anything in perspective or context.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A terrific film that blazes with perfection, although rarely any action, the basis of the film delivers us a great note","Jarhead is based upon marine Anthony Swofford's best selling novel that resembles about his pre-Desert Storm experiences and his experiences fighting in Kuwait. The movie is excellent and it shows a terrific view on Swofford's war experiences, including his training and boot camp experiences. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a masterful performance of Anthony Swofford. His performance is very well done and should be put up for an Oscar nomination. Once again, Jamie Foxx as Sgt Siek and Peter Sarsgaard as Troy also have fantastic performances. The direction by Sam Mendes and the screenplay by William Broyles Jr. mix perfectly as well as the cinematography and music are very good and blend in good with the movie. Jarhead is an excellent movie that doesn't always have to have action to be a successful film, but the basis of the movie about being a marine hits us with a great note. This is a 2005 film, that shouldn't be missed. I highly recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 9.5/10 **** A",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
All the elements are there...but it doesn't work,"I finally watched this movie on Blu-Ray last night. I love war/military type films so I figured it should be enjoyable considering all the good reviews. I don't know if the Full Metal Jacket clone first 30-minutes turned me off the to the rest of the film or just the generic story and acting? I like Jamie Fox in The Kingdom, which is a much better film. Jake Gyllenhaal was brilliant in Zodiac and End of Watch. I don't know if I've seen a film that spent so much of it's dialog on cursing as this movie does. As the story progresses you really feel the movie start to drag a bit and wonder if anything is actually going to ever happen. In the end this Marine unit misses the war and there is no fighting or shooting at all. Then to wrap up the movie is a retarded party seen with everyone drinking around bonfires and shooting their guns in the end. The only real saving grace of this film is Lucas Black's character and Peter Sarsgaard to some extent. There are so many much better war/military films then this, including the above mentioned The Kingdom and Green Zone if you like Middle East zones. I must also say that if this is how Marines typically act and are organized, they certainly aren't the well oiled machine I thought they were supposed to be.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Farcical Lie,"I went to see this film hoping to see something accurate if nothing else concerning modern day Marines. I spent 31 years serving the modern military, including eight with the Marines so I was looking forward to seeing it. What I saw instead is a dreadful anti-military propaganda piece depicting every type of psychotic malcontent and law breaker who ever was mistaken let into the military. This film is an open disgrace to decent men and women wearing the uniform of the United States. It is so bad it's hard to begin where to criticize without spoiling it for anyone misinformed enough to buy a ticket as I was (and I felt as though I was robbed at that). Current military people and veterans could watch this and know where to separate the childish fantasy from the minuscule bits of fact but civilians won't and that's the harm. This drivel will leave many viewers thinking this is an actual reflection of reality and it's not. It may have been marginally forgivable as a left-wing-anti-military hate piece if it had been billed as a complete work of fiction, but it isn't. It claims to be ""factual"".This film bears no resemblance to any real Marines I've ever known, with the possible exception of the character played by Peter Sarsgaard as ""Troy"". Not too surprisingly he is a dedicated, calm sea of professionalism compared to the rest. Also not surprising is that Hollywood made his character an ex-con to discredit any positiveness he could have brought to an otherwise dismal film. The one light of accuracy, if any, are depictions of the Marines in ""calmer"" circumstances, training and interacting with each other. Those are remarkably realistic but they are also boring. I think that's likely where the author went astray, he tried to inject something not boring into a real story and had to resort to making it up.Since seeing the film I went to the trouble of doing some research. It turns out that the author has been repeatedly exposed as having plagiarized some of the book, made up other parts that he claimed were real (he never saw anything close to combat, casualties or other things depicted) and stole a number of tired old barracks/urban legends and tried to foist them off as not only having been real but ones he witnessed or participated in (like the video of the one Marines wife with their neighbor - never happened). In short, a number of sources on the internet hold that he's a liar, thief and plagiarist. To top that off, some of the things he claims to have done in the book/film are actual crimes - felonies to be exact, that would earn him time in Portsmouth Naval Prison if they were true.I think I am left feeling stunned that any organization would stoop so low as to produce such an openly inaccurate and untruthful collection of garbage as this. All of the participants in this should be ashamed of themselves.",,Anonymous,Biography
Good but not Great,"This movie was a for sure rental. Jarhead is a war movie about how not killing is hell. It was very well performed, has a great storyline, but there is no action. Jarhead is a war movie that rises above the war and tells a soldier's story. It tells it with the urgency and pointlessness that all men's stories have, because if something has happened to us, then it is important to us no matter how indifferent the world may be. The movie is uncanny in its effect. It contains no heroism, little action, but it is good for a couple of laughs. Apparently non-wars are hell too. Jarhead opens like Full Metal Jacket redux, with Jamie Foxx as the insane drill instructor. But it belongs to a surprising Jake Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard, unravelling in the desert, turning to scorpion-fights and porn for entertainment, and eventually turning on each other. Bottomline - if you're looking for blood and gore; this is not the movie to see.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Gen X's ""Full Metal Jacket""; Gyllenhaal & Sarsgaard acquit themselves nicely","JARHEAD (2005) **1/2 Jake Gyllenhaal, Peter Sarsgaard, Jamie Foxx, Lucas Black, Chris Cooper, Dennis Haysbert. Not bad adaptation of Anthony Swofford's best-selling book account of his stint in the Marines during the first Gulf War where tedious waiting for action goes hand in hand with the brutal facts of war: war is hell. Somewhat predictable and akin to a softer version of ""Full Metal Jacket"" without the overwrought carnage. Gyllenhaal acquits himself as Swofford, a jacked up but no account to his own standings in the grand scheme of things and Sarsgaard as his fellow grunt has some nuanced low-key moments that counterbalance his one fine sequence of a meltdown that best sums up Sam Mendes' wait-and-see direction while William Broyles' adaptation seems half-baked at best.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The hands never forget,"Jarhead moved me on a personal level since it displays the life of a boy whom enlisted unaware of his future duties, of the wars being fought, and of the consequences it had on all those around them. From the wandering horse to innocent bystanders, everyone is affected (unfortunately for the worst, usually) and Jarhead shows the significant role each person plays despite the overwhelming circumstances.From the branding to chants, tradition and solidarity is still alive, but what does it stand for? Whether it's people running away from problems, trying to find meaning, living out their dreams or just simply trying to pay bills, every Jarhead has a story that's unique to themselves. Even after their deployment finishes, life never quite returns to its original normalcy.I particularly enjoyed the camera crew scenes and breakdown of daily routines since it details how average soldiers really are. No one is truly fighting with each others; only secular groups (instigated by those in higher power) and ""appointed"" officials that yield the masses. These people's attitudes are not intrinsic to the person, but rather the situation.Although the plot wasn't phenomenal nor the peripheral cast great, the overall movie was solid. From beginning to end, we see how the innocent boy we start with is now forever a Jarhead.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very well done,"Sam Mendes has done exactly what needed to be done with Anthony Swofford's personal memoir of the first Bush gulf war - he brought it to life honestly, with minimal embellishment, and with captivating artistry. A second viewing will be required for me, and I suspect that my rating will improve after I see it again. Mendes directing, and the straightforward script, combine to make what could have been a trial by tedium, brisk and entertaining.Swoff is a fairly typical young man - naive yet not idealistic, self-centered and myopic but not really closed to the world around him, sometimes arrogant yet not really rebellious - who has enlisted to serve in the first Bush gulf war. He's not really gung-ho about anything in particular, but nevertheless, manages to experience both the war and his preparation for it as a series of disappointments, protracted fits of boredom, and an exercise in humiliation and futility. The film is presented apolitically, and politics will only interfere with your experience of the film to the extent that you let it. As somebody who supported the first Bush gulf war, though not our stated reasons for launching it, I very much appreciated the insider view this film offered.The personalities in it are so vivid (some cross the boundary into stereotypes and never come back) that the film sometimes loses focus on its subject in order to comment upon individual people within the protagonist's very narrow field of view. Given the myopic character of the work from which this is derived, and the intense subjectivity of the approach, this turns out to be a strength of the film - making it truly original for its genre. this is no ""war film"" as the genre stands today, but rather, one of the first of what will likely be a postmodern redefinition of the war film genre - focusing reflexively on the practice of warfare as experienced by those who were actually there. An older, less polished, film that I particularly liked, but which seems to have been largely ignored comes to mind - ""Heroes"".Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swoff well, but for me, the supporting cast really made this film. I see this cast as an ensemble. To a man, the performances were flat-out exceptional. As with most of Mendes' work, the film is also visually stunning.Recommended, strongly.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A story of Jarheads and the other ""forgotton"" war","Jarhead defies the notion that you need the kind of ""action"" that Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down had to be a great movie. If you are looking for a movie with tons of fighting, this is not it. Instead it is the story not of fighting but waiting and soldiers coping with boredom. There are many a scene of dismembered Iraqi bodies , but there really is no ""killing"" in the general sense. That is the point of the movie , there was no killing by most of the ground soldiers during Desert Storm , and many of them were really unsure of why they where there. This shows a lot throughout the movie when the soldiers are trying to grasp why they are in the desert, and what they do to deal with not having a war to fight. There were 148 battle deaths and 145 accidental deaths during Desert Storm , and those brave soldiers deserve to be remembered just as much as the ones in Afghanistan (the other fortgotton war) and Iraq. Overall this was a great movie that hammered home the point of what soldiers go through in war, and the grim reminder of what kind of casulties modern war causes.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
the most action-less war movie ever made,"Jarhead, from Sam Mendes, is a good, solid movie with interesting characters and almost poetic dialog. Yet the previews for this movie were very deceiving, making the film look like a gritty, violent war movie, almost like Three KIngs (which is a much better movie). But it's not. The main theme of the movie is boredom. We watch these soldiers go through intense training, verbal and physical abuse, and ultimately see nothing come out if it.

A very poor movie - a gratuitous caricature of the USMC!!,"We've seen this Hollywood drivel before in the form of Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket. What's the message - apparently that anyone stupid enough to serve in the military is a deranged psychopath. I didn't recall seeing one example of brotherhood, teamwork or individual commitment but the movie does portray immoral behaviour, a disregard of authority, lack of personal discipline, internecine violence, the bodies of dead innocent children - and even the film's first scene involving the Air Force committing (you guessed it!!) a ""friendly fire"" mistake!! Someone - PLEASE - put a bullet in the head of this one. I had four good friends serve in the military as pilots - three Navy and one USMC. One of the Navy boys served in the first Gulf War - a Navy Combat Search and Rescure (CSAR) pilot who flew missions to rescue downed airmen behind enemy lines.

Good war film about the wait to go to war and what happens when you get there,"The story of an enlisted Marine as he goes from signing up to the deserts of Saudi Arabia to wait for war, and then into battle during the first Gulf War.Reviews from friends have been mixed, nobody didn't like it, but some people were floored by it while others were less than impressed. Going in I didn't know what to expect.My reaction to the film is one of disappointed enjoyment. The problem for me is that the film becomes a series of loosely connected sequences that didn't hold together once we head for the desert. No doubt that this is the result of compressing the source down because you really can't show several hundred days of people doing nothing. All of the bits were excellent unto themselves but at the same time they didn't connect well to each other and so I became distracted with each jump in time.This isn't to say this isn't a good film, it is. Its a very good film that clearly shows the boredom of modern warfare. Hurry up and wait. In its way its a very good anti war film since it clearly shows that the military is not all fun and games. One guy I was talking to on a train the other day, loved the film. He also said that while he wanted to serve his country, he was going to look for other options since after seeing this film the excitement to boredom level seemed to be very low.Definitely worth seeing.

""" This War  gives  little reason of why good Men should have to die for Oil ""","From personal memoirs and written with first hand knowledge of his military experiences comes a movie called "" Jarhead. "" Director Sam Mendes allows audiences to follow actor Jake Gyllenhaal as Anthony Swofford from Boot camp to The Gulf War otherwise called 'Operation Iraqi Freedom.' Swoffords' book describe the many experiences of the new Marine during his early days in Basic Training, through his desert travels in the Country of Iraq. He learns, as many young men have learned that going to war, does not necessarily means understanding why he must fight. A fact no one ever explains either. Although he and the military enters Iraq, indeed, Kuwait, to secure Freedom for the citizens of Kuwait, none are ever given democracy. In fact the country is returned back to the Despot King after the war ends. As for the movie, it becomes a fixture in Swofford's mind of all the misery the Corps bequeathes to him and his brother Marines. There is no glory in this war and even less in the country he is stationed in. He does however witness the political turmoil and double talk, of the various leaders of his own country from his immediate officers to the inept President George W. Bush who had to further invade the neighboring country of Iraq to try and finish Operation Desert Shield with Operation Desert Storm. The movie is slow to follow as is the gritty outcome of the war. Scenes from utter boredom, the childish behavior of his fellow soldiers to the emotional reactions of comrade's when receiving bad news from back home. Still the cast which includes Peter Sarsgaard, Jamie Foxx and Chris Cooper, make for good acting and an interesting story line. The memorable scenes in the movie include the burning of the Oil Wells which in itself are well worth the viewing and the long destructive mess left behind by the Air Force. ****",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Several seemed rather disappointed that the film wasn't more openly anti-war than it is; though politically a liberal, I was impressed by the effort to not take that obvious a stand and (for once) let the audience do its own thinking.While the action takes place in a relatively restricted time, place and era, I'm willing to bet that soldiers from any war -- Peloponnesian, Hundred Years or Civil -- could identify with the characters and situations. For that reason, I particularly commend it to people who have friends or relatives in the service.One mild warning: as in real life, the language and situations occasionally get a bit salty.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Well written and acted,"Saw Jarhead last night, in a packed theater, and was pleasantly surprised by not only the quality of the film-making but also of the story of this first major film documenting the gulf war(s). I haven't read the book that the movie is based on, but the film is very enjoyable in a dark, sad way , with some comedy that should not be funny in other circumstances, but the movie allows you to laugh and enjoy. About a marine who ""gets lost on his way to college"" and enlists, it is an autobiographical account of the first gulf war in 1992. Pvt. Swofford is assigned to a marine sniper group, and follows him through his deployment into Saudi Arabia and later Iraq. Like every other movie, it portrays how war affects the soldiers in it, psychologically and physically, and has a boot camp sequence that makes you want to run out and enlist (sarcasm). I give it a seven out of ten because of some loose ends that were probably not included from the book that might have been explained more (like the ending, horse, explosion, some others), and it seems to get a little preachy about the evils of military, but not to the extent of, say Apocalypse Now or FMJ.

A sobering tale of one soldier's experiences,"""Jarhead"" highlights one USMC soldier, Anthony Swoffords, and his experiences throughout the first Gulf conflict.From an plot breakdown, ""Jarhead"" is just another story about soldiers during war. But with a strong cast, true screen writing, and terrific cinematic style, a sobering experience is bundled into two hours.Let's get one thing straight: this is not a pro-war or anti-war film... and although I have seen other comments saying that Swoff (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is anti-war or anti-military, he is neither. Swoff is simply a character who is not in the right place. He realizes the depth of his decision in signing a contract with the military while in bootcamp, but he continues to play the game rather than rebel. He continues to be a good soldier, respects orders, and hopes to see some action and get a kill.Jake Gyllenhaal is the true star of this film, giving the best performance of his career. Jamie Foxx continues to show us he is ridiculously versatile, and Peter Sarsgaard gives a good performance, but there's a feeling that some scenes were missing regarding his character because we don't really understand him beyond being Swoff's partner and a (generally) level headed soldier.Besides laughing with realistic military humor and feeling for the soldiers as they individually deal with the reality of war, the truly twisting subplot with Swoff's girlfriend (he doubts her loyalty to him while he is way) is incredibly well integrated that as the audience, you feel for Swoff because this is simply added pressure in addition to the anxiety of facing this yet unseen enemy.Sam Mendes truly shows the stark and deadly beauty of the setting and occurrences during this war.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
lopsided,"It is weird to see a movie with brilliant direction, acting and a somewhat compelling story and yet still be left unsatisfied. The previews do not do this movie justice in any way, since they focus mostly on the brief moments of intense action and those are few and far between. To say that it is anti-climatic oversimplifies the deliberate choice to not have a climax. However in the sense that all of the tension of the movie builds up to a moment that contains none of the tension you would expect, the movie is classically anti-climactic. There are brilliant scenes throughout, though the voice over was a little melodramatic and the epilogue seemed pointless.

This made me feel like an airhead,"SYNOPSIS:
A psychological study of operations desert shield and desert storm during the gulf war; through the eyes of a U.S marine sniper who struggles to cope with the possibility his girlfriend may be cheating on him back home.REVIEW:
Just like Shot Caller, I struggled to figure out how to explain the film so I put IMDB's synopsis. It's really as boring as it sounds. I think they tried to spice it up a little by adding a ""psychological study"" but I really didn't get that. I got it for two intense scenes that was the best part of the film between Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) and another character that I don't remember and can't find on IMDB to reference. The short review of this film is that I didn't care about any of the characters. That may sound harsh also being that it's a war film, but there wasn't enough pathos in the film or any relationships that connected me. Dunkirk does the same thing, but captures the army as a whole that makes you feel atmosphere and sucks you in with the others. This went the route of trying to connect to a group of soldiers and it falls flat. Apparently, Swofford and another character named Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) we're very connected to each other that you find out at the end and I had absolutely no clue that they liked each other in any way. I thought they hated each other. I was so confused as to what the emotional connection was supposed to be. I also thought the acting from Sarsgaard was quite poor. There's one scene in a snipers tower that I liked with him, but that scene also made no real sense and seemed to only be in there to have some sort of conflict in this bland and slow film. There's very little good in this film for me, but if you've seen it and enjoy it, well that's what film is all about. I personally would recommend watch Sam Mendes's 2019 film ""1917"" over this as well as every other war film that's been made. 1.4/10.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jarheading experience,As a fan of war films I really enjoyed this movie for focusing only on the marines and very little of the war. They are fighting in the Gulf War which this is the only movie I've seen that they are fighting in Dessert Storm. Something people I knew that seen it there is fighting scenes the solders never see combat and that will throw off many audience members if they think they are getting into the traditional war film will blood and guts and explosions.The story follows many of the marines but the main character is Anthony Swoffward played by Jake Gyllenhall is a kid who only joined because he couldn't get into college and being a Jarhead was in the family his dad joined his grandpa joined. Swoff gets to be a scout sniper one of the coolest things in the marines. One complaint there is the whole sniper thing doesn't even matter until the end otherwise the whole movie could just be about a marine with no special title like a sniper.The emotional aspect in this movie is deep almost a little too emotional. There is one scene where the marines are watching a sex video and one notices it is his wife and neighbor and that is just one of those holy crap moments where you feel for this marine who isn't even part of the main cast. Besides the wives and girlfriends cheating on these guys you also see the war take it's hold on these guys either they have emotional break downs or they turn psycho.The action in this is phenomenal Jake Gyllenhall is great in this he really seems human in this role and you sympathize with him. Another great performance is by Peter Sarsgaard he plays great as the guy holding the marines together and he has this emotional scene towards the end that just leaves you feeling sorry for this poor guy. The weakest of them all was Jamie Foxx he has the funnest lines in the movie but has no emotion to him he is kind of a flat character compared to the rest of the cast.Overall I think this is a very unappreciated war film and it has its problems but is not to be overlooked I say a good rental and you will be satisfied with what this movie bring to the table.,,Anonymous,Biography

Inside a Jarhead,"There is a very poignant scene at the end of Sam Mendes' adaptation of Anthony Swofford's Desert Storm memoir ""Jarhead."" In this scene a bus-load of marines are shown returning home from the first Gulf War, the USA-spearheaded liberation of Kuwait. The marines are being celebrated via your run-of-the-mill parade down Main Street, USA. As their bus rolls slowly down that street an older, disheveled, weather-beaten veteran, wearing what seems to be his original, U.S. Marines-issued khaki jacket, suddenly boards the moving bus. Stammering but coherent he imparts his congratulations to the returning marines, repeating the motto of the US Marine Corps, ""Semper Fi"" (""always faithful""), repeatedly. After shaking hands with a few of the marines seated in the forefront of the bus he asks if he can take a seat and ride along with them. Though no one answers him directly he takes a seat behind the bus driver.Throughout this scene Mendes carefully monitors the reaction of ""Swoff"" (Jake Gyllenhaal), the 20-yr-old ""jarhead"" whose story we've followed since his enlistment into the US Marines. His immediate reaction is one of surprise. No doubt, like the other marines on the bus, initially he wasn't quite sure as to who the guy was or what his intentions were. But, once the veteran made it clear that he wanted only to congratulate the returning marines on their good work, Swoff's initial alarmed demeanor settled into a shifting feeling of horrified embarrassment.Embarrassment because during his short three-month stint serving as a sharp-shooter he never shot his rifle. Horrified because despite this sharp-shooting inactivity, and lack of authentic combat duty, he still managed a nervous breakdown and a hearty dose of post-war syndrome. With but a few glances at the troubled veteran Swoff innately understood that, for all intents and purposes, he hadn't been through much at all. Certainly nothing compared to what the veteran had survived. Yet, Swoff's brief war experience had permanently dented his psyche.How one reacts to that scene will tell you much about whether or not they liked this film, which is, ostensibly, the story, not a war story, about a 20-yr-old US Marine and his experience with the US Military during Desert Storm. Those who liked the film will probably have some degree of empathy for the veteran and Swoff. Those who did not like the film will probably believe that both got what they deserved when they embarked in their respective military endeavors. I believe this to be true because ""Jarhead"" is not a war movie, nor a political film, nor a polemical film, nor an ensemble film that follows a few characters in great depth. As simple as the title infers, it is the story of one person: Swoff. You'll either empathize with him or you won't. Take him or leave him. (Just as simple as that, in the story, his girlfriend back in the state drops him like a three foot putt.)This is not to say that Mendes' film lacks other qualities. Towards the latter part of the film his depiction of the Marines advancing across the desert towards a handful of oil-spewing, blazing oil refineries is spectacular. Touching too the arrival of an oil-slicked, short-of-breath, soon-to-die horse that Swoff gently strokes before the horse staggers off into the desert. Mendes also depicts the bombed ruins of a seemingly endless procession of civilian-packed vehicles that were singed via a precision military strike. The ghastly remains of that violent act cause Swoff to vomit.I found Swoff's story, and Mendes' depiction of it, mildly compelling.After all, this is the coming-of-young-age story of a 20-yr-old enlisted in a stereotypical, close-knit military society encouraging every testosterone-fueled emotion, dream, insight, action, and reaction imaginable. We've seen this tale told in countless ""war movies,"" from ""Full Metal Jacket"" to ""Meatballs."" Mendes should have spared us the derivative training sequences and focused more on ancillary exposition giving us more insight in Swoff: what makes him tick, his family, etc.Instead we are left to take Swoff, as is, in the present time. With not much to go on I found it hard to empathize with him. War is hell. He should have known that training for it and waiting for it would be hell in the suck as well.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"a movie, like it's lead character, in inner conflict","I can't deny that Sam Mendes's new film Jarhead has some power to it- that he and his director of photography (Roger Deakins) create some immensely evocative images, or that there isn't a little thought stirring around within the context of the story and premise. But my problem with it was in something that has kept other war films of years past afloat (though this time more a film about the Marines than any sort of 'war')- there's some sense of emotional connection with the characters. There's something sort of, well, empty at times with the film's situations and details and characters. I can't say either that 'not a lot happens', because in the sense of it being a character study there is...though on the other hand, there isn't. It's like there is a great film stirring around inside of the film's core, but Mendes is more often than not here going for amazement with the lens as opposed with characters that one can really care about. I'm not saying others won't, in a way it has the makings of a true 'cult' movie (not unlike one of its main influences, Full Metal Jacket- almost disgustingly so). On the one hand I think that things like atmosphere, composition, style especially in some bursts (there is one scene where the soldiers come upon a 'burnt' scene that is the most staggering in the film, maybe the best overall), maybe even Oscar-worthy. However, from a director who's past two films were far more engaging on their stories and characters, this is a bit disappointing.As I said, I didn't dislike the film, in fact at times some of the acting tried to suffice (and sometimes not). Jake Gyllenhaal's Anthony ""Swoff"" Swofford is a performance of some brilliance, if some over-doing. He's come a bit of ways since his Donnie Darko days, though one wishes that he could tap a little more into Swoff, with his Camus fascination and its projection onto the arid, boring desert life of Saudi Arabia. Stellan Saarsgard as his 'friend' Troy, a fellow 'bad-ass' kind of Marine, gives maybe the better of the performances of the main crop, adding a certain tenderness (or vulnerability) to the part, behind his mostly rough exterior. Jamie Foxx plays himself, only with a Sergeant frame of mind this time. And there is an assortment of supporting players rounding up the lot, with a mix that ranges from being fascinating to odd to downright conventional. There are times when the actors do try and make things entertaining, and it is (the ""interviews"" sequence is funny, if again a FMJ take-off). It's just the 'heavy-ness' that gets it down in the end. I would see this movie again, and I was glad I saw it, but I can't recommend it as highly as I wish I could.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A respectable, but not wholly innovative autobiographical account of the Gulf War.","Jarhead peaks in moments of its stellar cinematography and visual effects, which are scattered throughout the film and are utilised to great effect. It similarly utilises music to great effect.Gyllenhaal delivers a modest performance in the lead role and his character is bolstered a unique monologue that runs throughout the film.However, I could not help but feel as though Jarhead was recycling all the traits of the war film genre: mentally unstable protagonists, a near constant sense of toxic masculinity and some reflections on the horror of war.Despite Jarhead's clear nods to anti war sentiment, this is certainly not so much a politically motivated film as it is the gritty, intimate tale of one soldier's involvement in a war he is (to some extent) excited to be in.Jarhead is a competent film that tells its story in unique ways, but doesn't deliver a wholly original narrative.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Entertaining flick,"When we read movie reviews many of us take them with a grain of salt. ""Jarhead"" exceeded my expectations after seeing a high percentage of said reviews leaning towards the disappointing side. I have to say that the acting was well done by the majority of the cast, and that the transitions of the boot camp/shield/storm frames was easy to understand. Its hard not to compare a blockbuster war movie to ""Full Metal Jacket"", but I choose not to, because that is a high standard for any film to live up to. ""Jarhead"", for those who might have been misguided as to what it's about, is basically the story of a marine who is having doubts after joining the core and all the b.s. that happens while you are there. These include both the things that mess with your head from being in the desert for an extended period of time, and the things that you feel you are missing out on or have no control over that are happening at home while you are gone. With that said go see the movie, you won't be disappointed. Just don't expect ""Rambo"" type action, instead substitute a lot of real life situations that most people can actually relate to. You get all this while being entertained by a mixture of comedy and drama, but not lacking the action any war flick fan craves.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not an accurate portrayal,"The quality of the movie was very good. However, nobody should take this as the basis to that is what happens to our soldiers. Go into this movie remembering that this is Hollywood. Not all Marines are crazy, there is a lot more control within military bases then is portrayed. The scenes at the beginning and the end are pretty accurate however. Just to give legitimacy to my claims that this is not an accurate portrayal of Marines, I was a Marine an part of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. I feel that in a time when we have so many troops actively fighting over sees we need a movie that is going to help raise pride and morale in and for our men and women serving over seas. Don't be surprised if a lot of Marines especially Marine Snipers make the same basic comments I have. Just remember this was made by Hollywood. Sempre Fi",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A movie that pretends not to be political but, in reality, is is is.","Jarhead has two themes. The first is an exploration of the degradation and terror that Marine recruits go through in their training. The brainwashing techniques they endure were pioneered by Stalin, Mao and their sycophants but, apparently, are not unique to adherents of totalitarian ideologies.I work with several people who served the Marine Corps. It makes my skin crawl to realize that they accepted the mindless dictates of fanatical killing and absolute obedience that Jarhead presents. From now on, I'll think of them as psychopaths and be very very careful.I was glad to see the contemptuous rejection that a couple of the Marines receive from their wives and girlfriends. The Marines made their choices and became hateful people. At least, their women have the sense to dump them.The second theme of Jarhead is that none of this works. The fully indoctrinated Marines spend months in the Iraqi desert during the First Gulf War, with nothing to do but masturbate and tear each other apart, awaiting their opportunity to kill kill kill their assigned enemies.But they don't get to. Seems the Air Force boys with their big bombs have taken care of things. All they encounter are dead Iraqis. One of the Marines wants to adopt a burned Iraqi body as his pet but his superior thinks that's not how Marines behave.The opportunity to kill someone is what's sought more than anything else, and its bureaucratic denial drives some of the boys crazy. Maybe they should have thought a little more about what they were getting into.",,Anonymous,Biography
Jarhead...still feeling the effects...,"I rated this a 7. But you must understand that I would never give a 10, so 7 is a very good rating.I went to see this movie with great apprehension. Another shoot em up war movie, I thought. But it was the only one showing at the theater we like that showed an ounce of promise. That ounce quickly flashed into pounds as I sat there fixated on the beautiful editing, the remarkable acting, and the unexplained imagery.Much like the movie Three Kings, the desert scenes were shot with an endless ability to make sand and nothingness glaring art. Scenes of rolling white sands, gushing pools of black oil, and the distorted waves of heat all lifted the viewers from their cushioned theater seats to the middle of the arid desert.The acting by all the major characters was more than compelling, and aside from Peter Sarsgaard whom I was already a fan, also surprising. The shear anger portrayed by Gyllenhaal and the lonely loyalty portrayed by Sarsgaard were heartbreaking and so real. I truly believe that Sarsgaard and Jake Gyllenhaal both deserve Oscar nominations for these performances.But the one aspect of this film that I find most intriguing and powerful was the absence of useless explanation. This movie went out of its way not to insult the intelligence of its audience. There was much left to our own discovery and introspection. That is what I appreciated most.Regardless of one's feelings about war in general or the Gulf Wars in particular, there were impacts made by this film that cannot be denied. The horrifying emotions of soldiers from yesterday and today will likely never be completely understood. But films like Jarhead provide the much needed shed of light on their emotional plights during war and for the rest of their lives. Being able to illuminate these dark realities with comedy and humanity is why I believe Jarhead is one of the best films I have seen in a long, long time.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Different,"War movies are a difficult genre. The trick is to avoid both being overly patriotic and heroic, as well as avoiding being too negative. It seems to me that most war movies are made with either one of those two agendas, pro-war or anti-war. Both movies bore me really, it can work when the style is more oriented towards satire though.""Jarhead"" is different in the way that it stays clear of both agendas mentioned above. Based on the autobiography of a marine who served in the Gulf war, it tries to show the life of the individual marine. Staying away from politics is usually a good idea, especially when dealing with something fairly recent like the Gulf war. In scenes reminiscent of ""Full Metal Jacket"" we get to follow soldiers when they go through training and then we get to see them preparing for the war in the desert. A war that never seems to reach them.If you expect an action-filled war movie in the vein of say ""Black Hawk Down"" you will be sorely disappointed. This is a much more bleak and, i believe, more realistic look at how the modern foot soldier experiences war. He's been replaced in many ways by machines like tanks and, above all, airplanes. And in the end boredom is his worst enemy.Even though boredom is a prevalent theme throughout ""Jarhead"", the movie is never boring in my opinion. Rather it's an interesting look at pretty regular people that find themselves in an extraordinary situation, a situation that puts all their expectations to shame. Aside from the story ""Jarhead"" is also a very solid movie technically. The photography is beautiful, the music is well chosen and the direction from Sam Mendes is flawless. The acting is also above average from most of the actors, even Jake Gyllenhaal is pretty good. The one that stood out most though in my opinion was Jamie Foxx.""Jarhead"" is a very untraditional war movie and that makes it worth watching all by itself. But it's also interesting, well made and contains some great acting. A war movie that probably appeals more to people who usually don't enjoy war movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Surprisingly Good,"This is based upon a true story by Anthony Swofford of Marines getting ready to fight in the first Gulf War and Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swofford in the movie. You can be sure that many things in this movie did happen and you can be surprised/shocked or not.I said this is surprisingly good because I am a little tired of war movies as they all seem to be the same. Not this one.The acting is good all around. The cinematography is also very good and some scenes of the oil fires (remember them?) almost make you feel like the oil is raining down on you too. Those scenes are that good. But, this movie first deals with the time before the war actually starts for these Jarheads as they wait in the desert for the signal to go. Now, you can see how the time was spent and as mentioned already these things did happen and you can judge the results for yourself. Some questions you might ask yourself: is war good, bad, the same as other wars or different?Now understand that this unit of soldiers are all Snipers and there is one thing I didn't understand. When one mission was to take out two enemy officers in the same place, only one team was sent, the Shooter and the Spotter. Why weren't two teams sent? I mean you shoot one enemy officer and the other one has an opportunity to get away. That was the only thing I found wrong here. But, I wasn't there soThere is an awful lot of language, and a lot of very crude sex talk in here so be prepared for that. But, I would venture to say that the events rang true.And, you will also learn why Marines are called Jarheads. Hoo Ray!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A cinematic punch to the gut,"I have not read the novel, so I can't comment on whether or not it is a faithful adaptation. This is a dark and bleak look at war, with the brutality of it not being based on violence, blood or gore, which is not abundant in this. Instead, this explores the impact it has on the mind, and it is a truly chilling and devastating story. The plot is well-told, and the similarity to Full Metal Jacket is obvious, without detracting from the viewing(I wouldn't call it ""enjoyment"", and that certainly wasn't what the two directors went for) of either film. I believe this is the first time I've seen something helmed by Mendes, though I have been wanting to watch his work for a long time, and now I definitely will make sure to pursue more of it. The tone is unpleasant, and the experience of this is often suffocating. You feel trapped. This stares you right in the face and never blinks. The acting is excellent all the way. Pacing is impeccable. The cinematography and editing are incredible. I don't know how much of this is accurate and true to life, but it doesn't come off as exaggerated. This is highly psychological, and in that regard, is completely credible. The music is spot-on. While it is frequent, the narration doesn't come off as a crutch. There is near-constant strong language, as well as a bit of sexuality/nudity. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in how a battlefield affects the soldiers. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Oscar is spelled J-A-R-H-E-A-D,"Hello IMDb addicts. This is Brady. And I am an amateur critic. I grade music as well as movies, and I just got back from a movie. It's called ""Jarhead"", and it stars Jake Gyllenhall, Jamie Foxx, and Peter Sarsgard. And I thought it to be the first cinematic response to the current war. Just maybe not directly. The movie starts as Anthony Swofford (Gyllenhall, hopefully an Oscar nomination for him.) steps off the bus at his first day at boot camp. After getting the hell beat out of him by his drill Sergeant, he decides that the Marine life is not for him. So he tries to get out of it. He then meets his commanding officer Srgt. Siek (Foxx, in yet another Oscar caliber performance). Siek, is a bad ass, pure and simple. Swoford becomes a sniper. And befriends, and brands (watch the movie, it will make sense.) his sighter Troy (Sarsgard, yet another Oscar worthy performance). It follows them in the dessert from the first step off the plane until the end of the First Gulf War. No action, no politics. Swofford even says ""I never shot my rifle."" in the dessert when they find out the war was over. Simply put: Everyone regardless of your political stripe see ""Jarhead"".

"Some Good, Some Bad, Definitely Deserves to be seen nonetheless","I had high hopes when I entered Jarhead, despite his short career, Sam Mendes has proved to be a reliable and effective director, a future master in the works, both American Beauty and Road to Perdition have a proud space in my home video collection.After Jarhead, I still think he is a great director, but Jarhead sadly does not match up to the perfection he achieved in his previous works. However, not perfect is not the same as terrible, and Jarhead is far from being terrible, and I think it's mainly to Mendes direction, hence, his work should be commended.The main flaw in Jarhead is the structure of the screenplay, particularly in the opening minutes, which in this particular film, were critical and sadly diminish the movie a great deal. For those who have seen it, you will know what I mean, the obvious replication of Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Watching Full Metal Jacket could be considered a spoiler move regarding Jarhead. It has been mentioned before, that Jarhead is the Full Metal Jacket of our generation. In some cases that affirmation is a poignant reflection, but for a particular case, it's a sad reality. A critical scene becomes almost a spoof of Full Metal Jacket, making the movie fail to establish itself strong from the beginning.Most war movies that can be compared to Jarhead(I'm talking about The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket) established themselves from the start as being unique, special, emotionally shocking, and a commitment to be movies made out for a reason, Deer Hunter was mythic and metaphoric interpretations about the nature of war, and the tragedy of Vietnam, Platoon as a more personal and realistic approach to the struggles of individual soldiers, and Full Metal Jacket to the tragedy of the concept of soldier, all important films with impeccable craft.As for Jarhead, although the craft is very much as intense as in all of the previous mentions, with memorable scenes and sequences, the film's narrative seems to go, or try to go everywhere, and nowhere. For instances the film tries to emulate the personal drama of the individual soldier pretty much like Platoon and Full Metal Jacket did, then it changes to metaphoric and mythic films like Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now, then changes to a sort of more politically oriented film, and finally, plays with all those 3, and the it's concluded with extreme haste.The film tries to cover too much ground, using mixed methods of narrative and approach to the subject matter, giving the feeling that the screenplay did not have a clear intention of what it wanted to achieve.Personally, the film would have been enormously benefited by a narrative more a lá Deer Hunter meets Platoon, omitting the mythic aspects of the film(Russian Rullete). A lesser Full Metal Jacket approach to the First Act would have immensely helped the film by establishing a more serious focus, and a more realistic focus, kinda what Cimino did with Deer Hunter, and the whole First Act with the Wedding and such. And extended on the finale, just like Cimino did for Deer Hunter and Oliver Stone did for the post Vietnam Ron Kovic in Born on the Fourth of July.The obvious ode paid to Full Metal Jacket which backfires at the first act is a huge detriment to the film's result, the writer could have invented a better way to show how the film paid homage to Kubrick, one that would seem less copy/paste if you know what I mean.Aside from that, the film works, with it's impressive cinematography that makes all of the Irak sequence a memorable cinematic experience, on a par with Apocalypse Now, and even Lawrence of Arabia for that matter. The acting was also worthy of recognition, Jamie Foxx proofs you can have a good post Oscar movie, Peter Sarsgaard was brilliant as usual, and Jake Gyllenhall managed to make the jump DiCaprio had when he fell under the command of Master Scorsese.Mendes did a great job with the main body of the movie, one that deserves huge merit. My only advice to him is that he should have had at least two more re-writes in order to make the story(Beginning and End) a little better, more engaging I think qualifies as a good term, both the opening and the conclusion of the film feel a little too sophomore film making, very unusual to to what the rest of the film offers.Aside from that, a very good addition to the war drama genre, despite my complaint, I do recommend it.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A superb war film... with no action,"The trailer had really hyped this film up for me and I thought it looked like one of the coolest films to come out in a while... I can safely say I wasn't disappointed.The story follows that of Jake Gyllenhaal, a young American man who has no prospects for him back in America. Enlisting in the marines, he figures this may be a mistake. The story then unfolds with Gyllenhaal and his unit of marine led by Jamie Foxx on their tedious waiting in the desert for the Iraqis to finally strike to they can see some action.The Iraqis never strike, but one by one the men begin to lose sight of what they are there for, and all of them are in someway affected by their times in the desert.As stated in the title, no actual battle scenes occur in the film which I found bizarre for a war film... but I think it just deepens the meaning of this film, the way Swofford truly intended his story to be told.Jamie Foxx I feel turned in the best performance as the squad's staff sergeant delivering a very powerful yet funny role. Actually that said, this film is hilarious in places. For about the first hour you are treated to some scenes which aren't too far off from being in a Gulf War comedy.The shooting style is brilliant with the scene in the burning oil fields being incredibly moody and darkly shot.Overall I conclude this is the third masterpiece from Sam Mendes, and definitely worth a viewing.10/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Not for Jarheads,"This is one of the most beautifully crafted, moving, strong and poignant war films ever made. Sam Mendes excels with equally beautiful and horrifying images of war and machismo-soldier-making, Jake Gyllenhaal lives up to his ""next big thing"" tag (and could slip under the radar for an Oscar nomination solely for one harrowing scene where he wants to shoot a team member) with the rest of the cast providing astonishing performances and the film flows effortlessly from beginning to end and from scene to scene.In the war movie genre this will be labelled, with ""Black Hawk Down"", as a modern military movie. The tale is just as much about the individual as the war. The title may draw a macho audience who will feel somewhat cheated by the ever increasing promise of death and gore that never materializes.Comparisons to ""Full Metal Jacket"" are inevitable as the film is distinctly split in two parts  training and combat. However such simplistic labels are as redundant for this as they were for ""FMJ"" in the context of modern warfare. The troops battle boredom more than they battle the enemy. Make no mistake, this is an anti-war movie. You never see Colonel Kurtz's ""horror"" of war and this makes the film stronger. It is the pointlessness of conflict, soldiers killing people for a livelihood where their decisions are never under their own control. That war is absolutely good for nothing has never been so beautifully burnt on screen.Here Mendes is in his element as character, instead of conflict, become the film's essence. I have never seen a film where so little has happened and I have been so gripped. A must for war movie fans and a definite for everyone else.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Missing some elements to really hit its target,"Sam Mendes, director of ""American Beauty,"" the critically acclaimed film that brought him an Academy Award for Best Director, brings to the big screen ""Jarhead,"" a movie based on Andy ""Swoff"" Swofford's war memoir, which is more or less the same kind of war film we've all seen before. In it, Swoff is played by ""Brokeback Mountain"" co-star Jake Gyllenhaal and the film shows in its gritty language and sardonic humor the former sniper's recounts of how they live each day fighting boredom until they go to war.Upon his arrival at the Marine base, Swoff is assigned to C Company. There he meets his friend Troy (Peter Sarsgaard), a member of the elite Marine unit, and Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx), who picks him and Troy for sniper duty. Then commences Operation Desert Shield and over they fly to Saudi Arabia. Itching for some action and increasingly becoming bored creatures in the desert, Swoff narrates their long wait while suggesting some techniques ""for the marine to use in the avoidance of boredom and loneliness.""Basically the film's first part tackles the hell of a boot camp new recruits have to undergo. ""Swoff"" recounts how he was conceived, how screwed-up his life is, and how he got in the military. In many ways it feels rushed that sometimes you would like it to maybe linger in some scenes and hear more from him and the others. Some parts of the script also don't hold up well and may seem tedious to more cynical members of the audience.The second part of the film is set in the desert. The problem here is the absence of genuine tension as the film avoids much of the battle and gore in lieu of a bunch of men finding whoever they are out in the scorching desert. But there's not enough depth, and the somewhat uneven pacing of Mendes in the movie's first part tantalizes the audience with only a bit of character background. There's little emotional connection, and there is virtually nothing for the audience to root for.""Jarhead"" treads very much the same area its predecessors had and without a clear stand on the theme it tackles, it appears relatively banal. That's not to say it's a bad film per se. It is a middling film with good acting and good cinematography. But coming from a director with a pretty impressive resume, somehow one can't help but ask for more.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gyllenhaal is a convincing 'jarhead',"Let me preface this comment by saying that I am a thirty year old female who finds the idea of war repulsive. However, I thought this movie was fantastic (in terms of acting, cinematography, location, etc.)--although I will admit the ending felt a little anti-climatic.But perhaps the ending just reinforced one of this movie's strongest points, which in my opinion, was for us to understand that there is far more that goes on in any war than just killing. I have to wonder if we all have just become too desensitized (by the usual brainless, gory flicks) that we can't even watch/enjoy a movie like this that focused more on the psychological aspects of war and its effect on interpersonal relationships, than on the glory and machismo that comes with the ""kill.""I appreciated all of the sly nods to some of our past war movies (Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, Rambo, Platoon). They were (I thought) cleverly intertwined with a fresh approach to the genre. The overall film ended up being much more humorous than I believed it would be. Despite what I wrote above, there are still plenty of violent moments that are emotionally marked with intense sadness and frustration. Very solid and convincing performances by Foxx and Gyllenhaal allowed me to suspend my disbelief for two hours and fifteen minutes without looking at my watch one time. I left feeling like we have all undervalued the knowledge of what it must be like to be in the ""pins-and-needles"" experience of war like those encountered by the Marine soldiers in this movie.I strongly recommend viewing it at least once. Don't watch it thinking you will find definitive, black and white answers to morality issues regarding war. Instead, you will walk away with a better appreciation of the transformation that takes place when you take a young man and turn him into a ""jarhead.""",,Anonymous,Biography
"It was boring, really","I can understand how this film got so many people to like it. It's a well done film, realistic, no overdramatisation, no special effects... In fact I can imagine a Japanese movie that deals with training samurai then telling them they're obsolete. But until one gets to the basic idea of this two hour movie, one gets terribly bored.Maybe I was expecting something better, more intellectual, or at least more aggressive as an anti war movie. This was only a presentation of the mindset of US soldiers, nothing more, nothing less, thus boring.More than that, the characters were not really developed. OK, these guys were all different, all ""jarheads"", but who were they, really? Stripping a character of everything non-marinesque does not define it as a marine.As a consequence, I am grading this movie low.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Jarhead - More than a little biased, but still an excellent movie.","I just got back from an FSU advance screening that was packed, and was met with a lot of anticipation.I'll start with what Jarhead is. Jarhead is an excellent movie. It is an excellent movie with poignant acting (especially by Gyllenhaal, but the ensemble is truly great overall). It is a visual extravaganza - some beautiful photos. The burning oil fields of Iraq is quite a memorable scene. It is well-written and profound. It is directed gorgeously by Mendes, but with a bit less finesse than American Beauty. It is an important movie, examining the psychological aspects of modern warfare.Now, what Jarhead isn't.Jarhead is not a nonpartisan film. Its pretense at being ""purely"" from a soldier's perspective is not as viscous as it thinks; it's very see-through. I'm not completely sure if the movie even ONCE touched on the positive aspects of the Gulf War without mocking it with a large amount of bravado and testosterone. The brave soldiers fighting the Gulf War were mocked as animals, as bloodthirsty, sex-starved idiots who joined the army by default rather than by choice. This is not the truth of the matter. Now, I don't believe it was the ""duty"" of the movie to depict the entire scope of the Gulf War. However, I think it was incredibly irresponsible to give a 100% negative viewpoint on the conflict, all the while feigning ignorance of the current political context (yet, of course, still using certain disgruntled soldiers as ridiculously transparent soapboxes for current affairs).Broyles may have wanted to pay a bit more attention to eliminating political bias in his script. If he truly wanted to tell it purely from a soldier's perspective, he would have used his editorial license on Swofford's book to touch on the positive aspects of the war (or, at LEAST war in general), he would have shown a little more respect for those that were involved in the conflict rather than allowing them to be depicted as robots that either humped or shot anything that moved.Still, I want to give a big bravo to Mendes for a beautiful film. It really was a powerful work as a case study, although it was just so unfairly portrayed that I have trouble accepting it as being legitimately dealt with.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best non-action movie of the year!,"I saw this movie last night at a special screening. This film is generally well made and entertaining, however, there is really no story. In one line: Boy joins military, boy spends time in desert, boy comes home. Big deal. Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx are both good actors and both do a great job, along with the other actors in the film. It is well made, just a bit frustrating to watch. Sort of a non-action film, so to speak. It is interesting to see the transition these men go through, even though it has been done before....just this time with sand instead of jungle. If you are a fan of of watching young men, in various stages of undress, and many homo erotic scenes (which I am), then you may enjoy it. If not for these things and the shower scene, I really wouldn't recommend seeing this one at all. All in all, it was an enjoyable way to spend an evening, and it was free. If I had paid for it, I would be less impressed and would suggest waiting for the DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
It Will Make You See War in a New Way...,"This movie will make you see war in a new way. I've seen many war movies with plenty of atrocities and negative sides of war, but this film truly shows a unique and realistic view of war, that should make anyone reexamine their attitude towards war. I was & still am a supporter of overthrowing Saddam, but despite all the things we hear & see on TV, this film shows a more nuanced psychological perspective on war (albeit the previous one) that we rarely take into account as a society.Still, the story does not seek to defend either the left or right, or even to change your mind. It just shows things as they are. After seeing this movie, I'm even more convinced that the only people who should be allowed to send a country to war are those who have actually been involved in the painful realities of combat. I highly recommend this movie to everyone, regardless of your political views.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wait for the DVD,"Great acting (esp. Foxx and Sarsgaard) wasted on a story that's pretty pointless (maybe intentional) and ultimately unsatisfying (maybe also intentional).I didn't buy the emotional causes-and-effects we see, and walked out feeling I didn't know enough about these guys to care much about the happens to them, either in the desert or after they get home. We see a lot of crazy stuff, but never learn why it happened, or why these guys were stuck in it.Many of the characters are your classic war-movie card-board cut-outs (good 'ol boy from Texas, Latino new dad, jack-ass officers, wimp with glasses), whose obligatory character-establishing scenes distract from and eventually undermine the main story.This is not an action flick, for those looking for another Rambo. It also doesn't compare with the warrior movies it directly references (Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now). It isn't even as good as Courage Under Fire or Three Kings, from the same war.There *are* some excellently composed and executed vignettes, but the whole just didn't really go anywhere or make any kind of point. I had the same reaction to American Beauty, but loved Road to Perdition, so go figure.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Welcome To The Suck...IF You Wanted To See The Trailer,"I would agree with the one author here on many terms. The movie doesn't have what feels like a complete story. It is more of a ""slice of a life"" movie that doesn't answer all questions and leaves you with many more as you only see a specific period in the character's life. If I were betting, I'd say the adaptation of the book caused many a headache for the director and screenwriter. Adaptations are notorious for making disjointed films and this one seems another victim. Not that it is bad, there are many funny parts, many parts that wrench your gut if you have been through similar circumstances, and you do develop feelings for the characters. As for the people that saw the trailer and were hoping for another ""Top Gun"", they will be disappointed. This is more about disillusionment than bravado. If the military hadn't already seen the script (I'm assuming they did, and of course denied assistance) they might be hoping to see enlistment quotas go up. Not likely, unless the appeal of the scenes of homo-erotic camaraderie in the film override the scenes of hazing, ""Dear John"" letters and...well...other seriously unpleasant things. I came away with the feeling that the film tries to convey the point that the infantryman is a dying breed being replaced by technology not unlike the cowboy of the old west who had to give up the open range to settle down and drive a truck to work. All in all, I would recommend seeing this movie and look forward to the Oscars for nominations, especially for Sarsgaard.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Being a Marine Sniper between Gulf Wars 1 & 2, I wasn't sure if I'd relate...","I wasn't sure if I'd be able to relate to this movie, which plays out much more like an honest memoir than a war movie. Although some people might have been either shocked or confused by many themes in the film, I would have to say I thought they were accurate. I identified with most all of the thematic elements and I don't think that they were exaggerated for the sake of celluloid. I even found myself laughing (out loud) after a scene or line that I felt to be perfectly funny, though I was apparently the only one in the theater that thought so. Don't take each scene too seriously if you are easily offended--everything in it is pretty right-on, but it's all normal male bonding type stuff. Infantry (and more-so with STA/Sniper) platoons form a pretty close brotherhood where many times there may be no such thing as privacy (which is actually healthy for situations in which team-work is essential).As a Marine Scout-Sniper in a STA platoon and other units just after Gulf War 1, I was never a shooter in combat. I thought this movie might be past my experiences, but after watching it, I feel that it's a film many people will be able to relate to, not just combat vets (unlike many other more combat-oriented war movies). In fact, it was more like my experience than not.It's tough to relate any detailed accounts from the film without giving up the very simple and straightforward plot-line. However, I can tell you that it's glancing insight into interpersonal interactions in a unit like STA is an entertaining staple throughout the movie. I say glancing, because I don't think the director had enough time to delve any deeper given that it's less than a 2-hour piece. It's enough to give you a longview of the man's experiences. Take the time to believe the concepts the film presents (because it's a good account of a real experience), and you'll enjoy the whole thing.Technical: Other than one scene, I thought the events were very technically accurate. There was a scene where a sniper team was in a hide, and are approached and more or less caught off-guard. I wouldn't think any school-trained Marine Sniper would let that happen (without early warning systems or other countermeasures around the hide). Otherwise, all equipment, organizational elements, and armament/ordnance representations were very accurate.You know a movie's good when it changes your plans afterwards. Instead of going out, I went home to call some friends for Veterans Day! Cheers, Swaff!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mendes scores again,"Sam Mendes is going to be one of the most important filmmakers of the 21st century. His mastery of both the technical and emotional aspects of film will long be remembered. Such is the case with ""Jarhead."" Telling the tale of a young man, Jake Gyllenhall, in the role that will define him as a star, starting in the Marines during the Gulf War. The opening is familiar with ""Full Metal Jacket"" but soon evolves into it's own film. To avoid plot spoilers, I will avoid plot summary. The acting in this film is quite good, but has some shaky secondary characters. As I said, Jake is great, and it's quite shocking how large he is. He portrays rage, fear, and sadness all within one spectacular scene. Peter Sarsgaard is subtle as ever and is also able to portray numerous emotions that really connect with the audience. In one scene at the end of the film, you are shocked and feel for him as he let's it all out. Jamie Foxx is essentially the Lee Armey of this film, he's the rough tough, and often hilarious staff Sergeant who has some real depth but is wisely kept under wraps as to not distract from the essential story. The cinematography in this film is probably the most beautiful I have seen in a war film. While films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" use the shaky cam, ""Jarhead"" does as well, but Mendes is able to blend shaky cam with some truly magnificent shots. Towards the end, the oil fields begin to burn, and I have never seen something so tragically gorgeous. In general, the film is not only a must-see for war film fans, but fans of emotional valor and depth. Highly recommended, watch this one for Oscar season.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pretenses Garbage.,Not only was this movie a pretenses hack job of other anti war and anti military movies. take it from someone who was in the military I found this movie to be utterly insulting.

"Avoids the usual clichés and is interesting, amusing and quite different from the norm","Lost on his way to college Anthony Swofford finds his way into the Marines where, one quick haircut later, he is assigned to be trained as a scout sniper. He quickly learns how to kill silently from thousands of yards from his target, how to camouflage and how to efficiently carry out orders. His experiences in training are not all wholesome and fun but he is easily hooked by the part of the marines that he has joined. When Saddam invades Kuwait the US moves to defend the oil, sorry, the lives of the Kuwaiti people by mobilising the troops. As part of Operation Desert Shield, Swoff and his colleagues are bored out of their minds with the constant drills, routine and total lack of action, however with Saddam refusing to back down, and Operation Desert Storm about to commence, surely it can only be a matter of time.Although I have never read it, I understand that the point of the book Jarhead is that nothing at all happens of any significance and that Swofford's ""war"" was eventless and ended without him firing a shot  something that he had trained endlessly to do. So credit to Mendes then he has just about managed to produce a film that engages and moves forward while not losing this central core aspect. The film does this by focusing equally on the nature of the war and on the effect of this modern warfare on the soldiers. Most of the time the latter works well and it was only sections about Swofford's cheating girlfriend and him losing his mind that didn't ring true. Most of the time the film works best by just being a series of scenes where nothing happens  some of them funny, some of them depressing and many of them just ""there"". This worked for me because it held my attention regardless which it was doing. Occasionally it has digs at the modern Iraq war but it does this sparingly, which is just as well because none of them really work that well.Mendes quickly dispenses with the ""war is hell"" genre by taking away the impact of both Apocalypse Now and Deer Hunter in two scenes that are interesting for very different reasons, and what he is left with is ""war is dull"". This may not sound like something as worthy or as interesting as ""hell"" but the film easily shows it is. It shows the men being ratcheted up for killing, only for their training to come to nothing. Several of them say about the Marines giving their lives meaning and direction and it is interesting to watch them being stripped of this point as their time in the desert goes on. It doesn't always convince though and the cracks show where you get the impression that the film is starting to cover ground for the second time but generally I liked how it worked. As director Mendes creates some great scenes that visually stick in the mind while also drawing out performances from his cast that manage to rise above the war movie clichés  in fact only the drill sergeant at the start smacked of being a lesser copy of Full Metal Jacket (although in fairness everything stands in the shadows of Ermey's finest screen moment).The cast mostly work well with the characters, which is important as, with no significant action to speak of, this is where the vast majority of the film takes place. Gyllenhaal is good in the lead character and is able to convince as someone who gets pumped up with his colleagues as well as someone who has a bit of intelligence about him. Foxx is as solid as I have surprisingly come to expect him to be. He gradually takes his character from ""ho-ha"" simplicity to a point where his frank discussion with Swofford is convincing and part of a natural softening in his character. Sarsgaard has an interesting character and he brings it out well  with small touches and the breakdown that we know will come to someone eventually. Support is good although nobody really has to do that much in terms of character; minor roles from Cooper and Haysbert were reasonable but not that worthwhile.Overall an impressive war film that is interesting for avoiding the ""war is hell"" clichés and producing something different but just as worthy. Swofford's memories are done justice as the film provides just enough structure to prevent it becoming dull but not so much that it forgets the whole point of the source material. Not one of the great war movies but certainly well worth seeing and yet another interesting film from Sam Mendes.",,Anonymous,Biography
I'm glad John Wayne and Gary Cooper didn't live to see this,"""Jarhead"" is a 2005 film directed by Sam Mendes based on former Marine Anthony Swofford's best-selling 2003 book about his experiences in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. It has been described as a film about these young men bonding in the desert, but that doesn't match up with the film I saw.Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx are the big names in the film, with Gyllenhaal portraying Swofford and Foxx the staff sergeant in charge of his crew of snipers.After enduring a sadistic and seemingly pointless hazing by his new cohorts, Swofford finds himself sent off with them to Saudi Arabia. There they battle boredom, heat, official stupidity and their own banality. Tormented by the meaningless routine and (justified) fears of his girl's infidelity, Swofford goes ""off the deep end"" and threatens a fellow marine with a loaded weapon before begging that same marine to shoot him.As Desert Shield morphs into Desert Storm, the marines do many entertaining things, such as dodging friendly fire from above, making obscene gestures to arab women, blowing the heads off camels and posing for photos with the charred corpses of dead arabs incinerated by American aircraft while attempting to flee.Finally, after much angst, the war ends without any of them having fired their weapons. So they celebrate by shooting them into the air.Oo rah.Interestingly, the German title for the film is ""Jarhead - Wilkommen im Dreck,"" which I guess translates to Jarhead - welcome to the suck, an oft-repeated sentiment among these thuggish semi-literates. I am accustomed to a different and, in my opinion, more accurate translation of ""dreck."" Which is not to say that this is a bad movie. In fact, it is pretty good. It is, however, a very unflattering portrayal of today's U.S. Marines. I'm afraid we've come a long way from ""Sands of Iwo Jima,"" and John Wayne is spinning in his grave.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good movie, but not up to the usual war movie par.","If you are going to see Jarhead because you want to see an action packed dramatic war movie, you may be a little disappointed. This movie lacks the realistic fighting scenes and heart-pulling drama of the usual war flicks.BUT! DO see it, because the acting is very good. Jacob Gyllenhaal's acting is impressive and proves that he is definitely going to continue to do amazing work in the future. As well, is Peter Sarsgaard, and obviously Jamie Foxx. Chris Cooper is also a great actor you'll see in the movie, although his abilities are not especially tried in his role. His character made me laugh.Jarhead includes a handful of recognizable characters, as is the norm in these types of movies. An example is Evan Jones, who played Cheddar Bob in 8 mile. He basically took the exact character of Cheddar Bob and threw on some cameo and a helmet.Good movie, but I found the plot to be a little boring. I'd have rated it a 6, if it weren't for the acting. But the acting was good enough for me to recommend that you see Jarhead whether that be in the theaters or just wait till it's on DVD, since there are no incredible action scenes that you'd want to experience in a theater.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The Anomaly That Is ""Jarhead""","Jarhead"" is an anomaly of a film. Based on a book that details the account of one man's experience in the Marines during the first Gulf War, ""Jarhead"" is paradoxically neither a war movie nor an anti-war movie. It is instead a psychological drama about the torment of waiting for war to begin. And in this case, the ""waiting"" being the waiting for the war that only lasted a week, ""Jarhead's"" significance is lost in light of contemporary context and recent political contradictions. Nevertheless though, as one Marine in ""Jarhead"" so bluntly puts it, ""Fuck politics. We're here now. All the rest is bullshit.""Therefore with that being said, ""Jarhead"" as a cinematic entity in itself, is a work of art. ""American Beauty"" auteur Sam Mendes brings an elegant sense of style and humor that elevates the movie from its psychological premise to a series of somewhat more familiar experiences to the viewer. For instance, by including scenes of male bonding, Marine life challenges, and ""missing your girlfriend/wife"" masturbation, Mendes creates a portrait of what being a Desert Storm jarhead must have been really like. His direction coupled with cinematographer Roger Deakins's eye for mirage-like, visually sumptuous images make ""Jarhead"" seem like more than the sum of parts.Alas, Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as author/narrator Anthony Swofford, does not add to this equation, however. While Gyllenhaal performs admirably, the range of emotions he is supposed to go through by the film's end, do not feel distinct enough so viewers ever feel the change he's gone through is real. Nevertheless though, brilliant supporting performances by actors such as Jamie Foxx, Peter Sarsgaard, and Chris Cooper all make up for this by adding wit, pathos, and respectability to their roles. Sarsgaard, in particular, standing out for his performance, as Anthony's bloodthirsty, psychologically troubled colleague, Troy.In conclusion, ""Jarhead"" is an unfortunate disappointment. A work of art filled with beautiful imagery and sprinkled with several brilliant performances, yet nevertheless confounded by its lack of action scenes and its message's historical context, its anomaly is its own downfall. A really ambitious and thought-provoking film, ""Jarhead"" makes the torment now of people waiting for a real ""war"" film all the more anxious. Welcome to the suck, ladies and gentlemen; we might be waiting awhile.-- 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Well, my opinion has done a complete 360. This was the best movie I have seen in a long time. The director did an amazing job putting on film what really happens during war instead of ""hey lets blow everything up and kill people"". It takes so much of me to say that I love something, I mean I am a very picky person when it comes to movies. Well, I can say I LOVED this movie.

Full Metal Jarhead,"For both better and for worse Jarhead, the new film based on a 2003 best-selling book by former marine Anthony Swofford, is not just another war film.That is not to say it doesn't share any similarities.Like many recent films about war Jarhead tries its best to become immersed in the feeling of military life. From the locations to the sounds, everything is authentic. Important is the acting which never becomes theatrical as the performances strive to echo true marines.Jake Gyllenhaal especially shines as Swoff, able to give a surprisingly subtle performance that never really cries out, ""look how brilliant and intense I am!"" The entire film is really quite subtle in this way and this lends to an overall uneasy feel that Jarhead lets unquestionably sink deep.Also, director Sam Mendes crafts stunning images in only his third film (he previously made the award winning American Beauty and then Road to Perdition with Tom Hanks), as burning oil fields and sun-bleached sand dunes are displayed in full glory.Jarhead even strays into narrative territory that has already been explored before. It begins much like Full Metal Jacket with a yelling and almost comically abusive drill sergeant proving the horrors of boot camp. In turn, the marines slowly become more and more eager to shoot something.However, such similarities in turn compliment the ways Jarhead is actually a commentary on these perceptions of war. It is, ultimately, quite unique.Unlike ""classic war films,"" such as Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now, Jarhead is more about what happens when the intensity of battle never really comes. All the marines in the film are pumped up for battle, at one point actually watching Apocalypse Now and cheering as helicopters blow up targets.Yet they never get this same opportunity.As an audience member I found myself waiting for that big battle scene but it never really comes. And it never should.You see, this is not a film for those seeking mindless action. Jarhead isn't afraid to scrutinize the bloodlust that can fill both war and people and it shows the need for this bloodlust to be quenched, whatever the cost.It questions the perceptions of war that have pervaded our culture, asking if it is death and destruction that truly defines what war is.With this said, some problems do arise with the film.There is always a distance kept from the characters. We see that they are bored and that problems such as endless waiting and cheating spouses are their greatest adversaries.Yet the characters never grow or change. Simply showing them as anxious to fight is not enough to fill up two hours.Especially as some horrors of war finally begin to trickle in, such as the aftermath of a massacre in the desert, we never see the effect on the battle-ready mentality of the soldiers beyond some immediate outward emotions.At the end of the war are the marines any different than when they went into it and why? What happens to all the anxiety built up within them? Jarhead never really attempts to answer any of these questions.It is also somewhat ironic that this is a film released in the midst of the second war in Iraq because the war of today is a much different beast than the Gulf War. In this current war there isn't a problem of not having enough ""action."" Likely this new Iraq war is the battle that the soldiers of Jarhead yearned for while waiting in that desert.The makers of Jarhead claim that they do not have any direct commentary on the new Iraq war and the film echoes this. This stress for objectivity sadly cripples some of the lasting power, though.By delving into the ultimate results of the Gulf War on its restless troops perhaps certain truths of today could have become illuminated.Jarhead mentions that, ""All wars are different, all wars are the same."" It is this simple yet paradoxically complicated message that best defines Jarhead while also keeping it from becoming all that it could have been.Critic's Conclusion: Don't expect much action from Jarhead, a movie that focuses on how boredom and tedium can be dangerous weapons in warfare as well. Overall it is a fairly unique and thought-provoking film full of unforgettable images, though at the end there is a sense that Jarhead doesn't reach the full potential of its themes and images.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Its about life in the military, not death","This movie was amazing.On the way to the theater, my girlfriend was telling me it received bad reviews [2 stars out of 5?].

But thats where the movie rocks...its not afraid to show off, and there are some pretty shocking scenes. The visuals are very impressive, and it is hard to believe that this film was shot in our own states, not in Iraq. The scenery can be beautiful at times too.As my title states, this movie follows the life of one STA marine through his time joining to his time leaving.

Every War is Different,"Are you used to seeing dead bodies, bullets flying, people dying, and soldiers crying? This is not that kind of movie, and that's totally OK.Jarheads are Marines, so called because their haircuts make their heads resemble a jar and by extension makes them a jar: an empty vessel. ""Jarhead"" is one man's encapsulation of his life, and by extension the life of other Marines in basic training and in Desert Storm (the first war in Iraq).At first this movie looked like a replica of ""Full Metal Jacket."" All I could think was, ""Been there, done that."" Once Private Anthony Swofford and company left basic training for the fight in Iraq the movie went a different direction. We got a glimpse of Marine life in the hot Iraqi desert as they waited for action. Perhaps the viewers were waiting as well, I know I was. I wasn't waiting in an anticipatory ""Let's kill some foreigners"" way, I was waiting in a grim, semi-despondent, ""They're about to joyously kill some foreigners"" way.We actually didn't need combat to see what these young Marines were about.

The film's technical aspects are very good. When it comes to the themes and what it's trying to say, that's when it gets to be a little too murky, and whereas it's pretty much flawed.

True- Nothing Happened,"'Jarhead' does an admirable job of portraying young Marines as they truly are in life. At times subtle-as-a-flying-mallet with a dash of torrets syndrome. The feeling that 'nothing happened' is bound to be the underlying emotion after seeing the movie yet all one needs to do is consult the history books. For ground troops-nothing happened.We get to see, instead of storming the beach scenes, young men attempting to cope with life in a prison like setting. Hell, even prisoners have better accommodations. Their battles are fought on the home-front as they attempt to maintain relationships while on seemingly endless deployments.This picture is one of military life more than a war movie.

"JARHEAD (Sam Mendes, 2005) **1/2","I've watched all of Mendes' films so far (not to mention a stage adaptation of Chekov's ""Uncle Vanya"" directed by him and co-starring Emily Watson during my week-and-a-half stay in London in 2002) but every new effort seems to me to be a lesser achievement than the previous one! Anyway, while the film is essentially  and typically  well-made (particularly the editing, propelled by an eclectic soundtrack), it's also unoriginal since it basically rips off FULL METAL JACKET (1987)  but is inferior to it in every way (with the second half, as described further down in my comments, being even more of a let-down than that film's!)  as well as having elements from both SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) and particularly BLACK HAWK DOWN (2001) thrown in for good measure!Despite good performances by the established actors (Gyllenhaal, Sarsgaard, Foxx and Cooper) and the fact that the film is based on true events, the characters are total stereotypes (with the sex-obsessed camaraderie being especially alienating)though the recruits' frustration/jealousy over their respective partners back home, albeit over-emphasized, is perhaps the film's sole novelty! Besides, it's disappointing that the soldiers see no real action during their stay in the war zone  and neither is the intriguing suggestion that a war veteran remains inclined towards violence and never truly readjusts to civilian life developed in any waywhich, ultimately, renders the whole thing somewhat pointless!",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

You couldn't get a better duo on screen like two of the best comedic performer's like Jamie and Jake. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a trigger happy sniper that wants to kill someone before he goes back home. Jamie Foxx plays his hard, but caring Staff Seargant. All in all it is a movie worth seeing Jamie Foxx and Jake Gyllenhaal were great on screen together. The reason I gave the movie a 7 out of 10 was because i wanted to see more battle, just like the previews showed, but you don't usually get want you want and that is life. O well.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is what we are,"Excellent movie.I spent five years in the Marine Corps. I never went to war, but when I was stationed in Japan we had a wary eye fixed on North Korea. It was constantly beat into our heads that the war could come, and probably would come, very soon and without warning.Put people in this situation, and things like Jarhead depicts do happen. Training people to kill and telling them they probably will get a chance to very soon will warp their minds. This isn't bad, or good... it's just the way it is. Normal people just aren't capable of warfare.We never actually deployed, so things didn't quite rise to that level, but they definitely moved in that direction. And when warning signs got a little harier... or there was an incident along the DMZ... the pre-war insanity went up a notch.Not every Marine or Marine unit will respond to the pressures of impending combat the same way. Individual personalities, unit cultures, assigned missions, will all work together to shape a different response. But the response of these Marines to the impending war is completely believable.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hits the viewer right where it's suppose to...a work of genius!!,"I watched this movie a couple of days ago and since then i haven't though about much else...this movie really has a special thing to it. For the first time in years i watched a movie that gave me this weird feeling when i walked out of the cinema...i felt exactly the same way as the soldiers, Swoff and all the others...more than 200 days of hard training and nothingness and what did they achieve...NOTHING. They only lost their girlfriends, their sanity and the ability to think normal ever again.It's a funny movie at many points, but still i didn't feel like laughing after the movie finished, i felt empty...lost. I know that many of the critics has depicted the movie as being a movie with no message, that its empty but they haven't looked at it the right way. I am sure that they had the same empty feeling when the movie finished, but they should try to analyze that emptiness...that longing for a kill...that longing for a normal life...brilliant friggin movie Do i like this movie?

More than meets the eye,"Mendes is most famous for directing films which defy social norm in terms of genre. American Beauty transcended the usual pigeonholes constructed by the modern movie-making community, and Jarhead follows suit.I would not classify Jarhead as a war movie except by merit that it takes place during Desert Storm and involves United States Marines. Jarhead is a movie about people and what war (and the military mindset) does to the human beings who fight it, not about how much theater blood and computer-generated carnage they can cram into 120 minutes. If this is what you expect, then save your money.Taken not as what one might like it to be and rather what it is, I find Jarhead to be, while no means perfect, a fitting addition to the modern war movie library. The acting and cinematography are exceptional; Jamie Foxx adds a very nice touch to the lineup as the Staff Sergeant in charge of the other ""jarheads."" Character development is meticulous, sometimes too much so at the cost of pace, but in the end the effort is not in vain.I think the biggest drawback to the film's potential success is its somewhat misleading nature: a movie about Marines in Desert Storm demands violence abound, and this is no doubt what many people will see it for. In their unfulfilled expectation of this, they will miss the underlying subtleties each well-acted, beautifully shot scene has to offer. Many will jeer it as a film attempting to reproduce Full Metal Jacket and failing miserably, but chances are those people never saw American Beauty and don't see films for artistic value. In fact, I would even consider the movie to be anti-climactic, but again, that's assuming expectations that the film never promised to begin with.Not Mendes' finest movie, but far from terrible and one I found very enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Watch Ishtar instead. Welcome to the suck.,"Good message, good visuals, good cinematography, terrible movie. This is the first movie I have ever rated a 1, and I hate to do it, because I don't like to think that there are movies this bad out there. The first thing about this movie to jump out at me as being inexcusably awful was the script. The script was not just poorly written, but it's completely unoriginal. From the get-go, we hear lines straight out of Full Metal Jacket, some word-for-word, some just copied with a change of words. Examples: ""You... like old people f*ck!"" Also how the drill instructor grabs the guy's neck and shoves him on the ground. Another copy from Full Metal Jacket is when the main character goes nuts and recites ""This is my rifle..."" The same thing happens to Private Pyle, he recites that line, kills his own guy, then turns the gun on himself. The only difference here is that the trigger isn't pulled. The latrine burning scene was copied from Platoon. Not to mention a two-minute scene from Apocalypse Now. Camels are also shot in Three Kings. The plot is inexcusable. Why are the small group of Marines marching through the desert in the middle of the night by themselves? This could only happen in Hollywood. Scene transitions are pathetic. The plot doesn't flow. The military behavior, such as the commander taking the time to argue with the main character's sniper partner while in the middle of calling in coordinates for an air strike, seems to not be realistic. The last scene, in which the two walk over a hill and are all of a sudden back at base camp, is hard to believe, as is everyone firing their guns into the air. What is the point of the movie? The ideas that the half-war is frustrating to the Marine Corps grunt and that war is pretty crazy do not take another feature-length movie to be understood. Lots of things just don't make sense and are evidence of a relatively thoughtless story. For example, the main character tells the drill instructor that his dad only talked about Vietnam once, and therefore convinces him that he is genuine. However, when we see his dad, he is wearing two dog tags at the kitchen table, which runs contrary to the idea that he was not open about it. This is simply careless movie-making. What is a horse doing in the middle of an oil field? It's a stunning image, but it doesn't make any sense. It seems like the creators of this movie thought that having Sam Mendes as director and producing artistic visuals in reference to the Iraq conflict would make people oblivious to the fact that the movie sucks. Apparently it worked on most of you people enjoying your dunk neck-deep in the excrement of popular mass media.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Severely disappointing,"Got to catch a sneak preview of my film through my school. So stood in line for more than hour (with 300 other people) to get to watch Jarhead (the movie was followed by a Q&A with he author of the book).A severely disappointing film, I must say. With a director like Mendes, and a cast of Gylenhaal, Cooper (woefully underused) and Foxx, and great looking trailer, how could this film go wrong? The movie starts off great enough. Great voice-over by Gylenhaal, the beginning of the film is funny, gritty and engaging. But once they head to the desert...The character of Sarsgaard is just plain strange. No idea what is making him tick, and his personality changes just too many times over the course of the movie, and his character's final denouement is a bit of a letdown. Foxx is put to great use here. He plays his role very well (as usual), putting in the right amount of attitude his role requires. Cooper is barely on screen for five minutes, and is utterly wasted. (You can catch most of his screen time by just watching the trailer). Finally, Gylenhaal is good. He manages to put in the frustration and trigger-lust that his character needs to show.But the first and last words of the movie (he story about the soldier) simply do not resonate. they might be true in most other war movies. But in this movie, which tries to be the anti-War movie, the line rings hollow. But the movie itself has no goal, no aim, no direction. The movie moves from one scene to another without any regard for the previous one, and the impact that Mendes so brutally delivered in each and every scene in American Beauty, is sorely missing. Some scenes are just present to shock you, others to provide a great looking shot. An example is the dream sequence featuring 'Something in the way' by Nirvana. A great song, a great concept for a shot, but it just doesn't click. No impact whatsoever.Finally, the movie can't decide whether to be a political movie, a war movie, a statement against war, a statement about boredom, and finally an ineffective muddle of the lot.The entire film pretty much just looks like a setup for the trailer. So save yourself a few bucks and just go watch the trailer another time.",,Anonymous,Biography
As Unfocused as the Gulf War Itself,"""Jarhead"" is like a ""best-of"" compilation film of other classic war movies. At different times, it reminded me of ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Full Metal Jacket,"" and David O. Russell's ""Three Kings,"" among others. The problem is that it never achieves a style or point of view of its own. As a narrative, it's as unfocused and messy as the war it's about. However, it does manage to send you out of the theatre remembering specific images or moments, so in that way it's effective.Director Sam Mendes obviously wants us to feel the way Martin Sheen's character does in ""Apocalypse"": adrift in a surreal nightmare. However, the difference between Coppola's film and this one, and what made the former successful and this one less so, is that even among the madness of Vietnam, the protagonist of ""Apocalypse"" had a distinct purpose. The movie was moving toward an eventual goal, which gave the chaos of the rest of the film some foundation. In ""Jarhead,"" it's all chaos and no apparent goal, which Mendes seems to be saying is the point of the Gulf War in general, but that doesn't necessarily make for a compelling film.It doesn't help that the characters in ""Jarhead"" remain virtual nonentities. They are the stock characters of any war film, easily described in one-word summaries: the ""crazy"" guy, the ""sensitive"" guy, the ""jaded"" guy. We really learn nothing about the central character played by Jake Gyllenhaal, and what we do learn about him is wildly inconsistent.The entire film feels vaguely critical of American military policy in the Middle East, but it never sharpens its critique into any point that has impact. This isn't the first time Mendes (a British director) has pointed his criticism at American values and left me wondering what point he's trying to make. David O. Russell does a much better job in ""Three Kings,"" because he introduces an opposing point of view to American actions. ""Jarhead"" is so insular, so focused on a bunch of kids that don't have any point of view, that we don't really have a point of view either.But as I said earlier, there are some very memorable sequences in this film, and even if they never really coalesce into anything of substance, taken on their own they have their own emotional impact. I particularly liked the sequence in which the soldiers are being interviewed by American media, but are coached beforehand on what they are and are not allowed to say. That's a much-needed reminder that we at home are likely never really getting the true story of what's going on in foreign lands. Other images, like a horse covered in oil, wandering through burning oil fields; or a highway full of charred cars and bodies, everything still frozen in the exact position it was in at the moment of destruction, come close to equaling some of the images Coppola gave us in his film.America has dug itself into a hole in the Middle East, and who knows how or when we're going to be able to dig ourselves out of it. ""Jarhead"" wants to add yet one more dissenting voice to our country's actions, but it doesn't really have anything new to say. If its words were as good as its images, I would say it could be a terrific movie. As it is, it doesn't have the stuff to join the list of all-time great war films.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Muddled plot with some a strong performance makes Jarhead a mediocre film,"'Jarhead' is the latest film film from Academy Award winning director Sam Mendes ('American Beauty', 'Road to Perdition') about a Marines unit during the Gulf War. The story revolves around sniper Anthony ""Swoff"" Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his scout friend Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) as they serve their tour of duty in Iraq. They are commanded by Staff Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx), a tough-as-nails leader who demands complete motivation and hard work. As the film progresses, the viewer begins to understand more and more the situation that Swofford and co. face.The Gulf War was very short - only four days and the film makes a point about this. Swofford and Troy are trained to fight against the Saddam Hussein's troops who have invaded Kuwait only the war is over before they can actually kill anyone. Swofford wrote an autobiography of his experiences about the futility of training young men to fight without ever actually giving them the opportunity. However, as interesting a point this is to make the film ends up feeling muddled and dull.In the Stanley Kubrick film 'Full Metal Jacket' the viewer sees Marines being drilled to become perfect, mean, killing Marines and perhaps even robots. The difference between 'Jarhead' and 'Full Metal Jacket' is that the former does not devote as much time to build up this vital plot point. There are scenes that involve a drill instructor and a boot camp but they are not nearly on the same level and intensity, nor does it really push through the plot. The entire film talks about the daily boredom the Marines face in Operation Desert Shield then Iraqi Desert Storm as they eagerly wait for the chance to shoot at the enemy. However the film feels stretched out and has some bizarre scenes that apparently serve as metaphors. As someone who has not read the novel I can not accurately comment on whether or not the film incorporated the elements from the novel although screenwriter William Broyles Jr. ('Apollo 13', 'Unfaithful') seems to muddy up several scenes. The viewer gets a sense of the irate atmosphere but that does not mean it has to be dull and long. Although this is the main flaw of the film, there are some positive elements.Sarsgaard has proved himself a capable actor in films like 'Garden State' and 'Kinsey' and here he lives up to the reputation. He has one very emotional scene towards the end where he perfectly delivers the difficult emotions and his frustration with the situation. Gyllenhaal also proves himself talented although it feels as if he is a pedestrian, and as if he is the lenses for which the audience sees everything through. Oscar winner Foxx also plays his role with solid charisma, although he is given less to do than in his sublime performances in 'Collateral' or 'Ray'. Other notable cast members include Chris Cooper as a Lt. Col. and Dennis Haysburt as a Major who causes some big problems for the main characters. There are also some impressive technical elements.Ace director of photography Roger Deakins has some striking images such as burning oil fields and the dry heat of the desert frustrating the Marines. Editor Walter Murch is able to inter cut splice in some nice imagery throughout although as mentioned before the film drags it's heels. Mendes expressed admiration for how Kubrick directed 'Full Metal Jacket' in previous interviews concerning the film. His admiration shows very clearly. He wants to make a strong point with 'Jarhead' without the messy elements of politics or modern day comparisons. And to some degree he succeeds yet at the same time the film feels disconnected. In 'Full Metal Jacket' there are some stark and fascinating caricatures of the Vietnam Marine yet Kubrick somehow infuses a life into those characters.'Jarhead' is not necessarily a bad film, nor is it really a good film. It's mediocre and while the murky plot elements drag it down, Sarsgaard impresses very much and the visual elements are a plus. In some ways, it just could've been done better.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jarhead,"Jarhead, is based on the book of the same name by Anthony Swofford. The film tells about Anthony's experience as a young man as he was a lance corporal in the United States Marine Corps. He was in the scout/sniper position and was in Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait during the Gulf War. The film shows Anthony's relationship with the other Marines and the sergeants and what they do while they are stationed out there and what they do before they can finally come home. Jarhead, has good direction, a good script, great performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. The film is well made in just about every possible way and it is a very engrossing and compelling film. The film has some very powerful moments, is bold and one of the strongest things about the film are it's characters. The film focuses on several different characters through the film and I found that the characters were all very interesting and we got to get some personality traits here and they were all well played by the actors. Jake Gyllenhall, who plays Anthony Swofford, does a very good job of playing his character through different emotions and situations and one this film's strongest points is it's different characters. The film is about a war but there is no real combat or fighting scenes in this film. Instead of that it's how these characters react to the war, the training and each other. I found this to be more interesting and powerful than if it had long epic battles in the movie. This reminded me of the film The Deer Hunter, because in that film it shows more about the characters than the war also. The other thing that is really good about this movie is it's look and feel from it's great director Sam Mendes. I immediately knew Sam Mendes, would be a great director after I first saw American Beauty, in 1999. It was one of my favourite films of that year and it left quite an impact on me. I then saw his second film Road To Perdition, which I did not like as much as American Beauty, but I thought it was great too. Now, Sam Mendes comes to us with Jarhead, and it is quite a great achievement and I think after only three films so far in his career that he will win many more awards and he is on the path to becoming one of today's best directors. I think some may be disappointed in Jarhead, for not being more faster paced or having the battle scenes but for a powerful film about characters and how they react to war and these situations this is a film for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Spotty but good,"Pretty good movie. Although it doesn't rate on par with the other classic war movies.Seemed to be more of a collection of short-short stories tied together to give the audience an impression of the Gulf war rather than having a linear story about an individual in war.Don't be surprised if Peter Sarsgaard is nominated for a Supporting Actor Nominee.Good enough to see, has some great scenes, but doesn't have enough to put it in the pantheon of war films, which it undoubtedly strove to be a part of.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The movie portrays the viewpoint of the soldier in modern combat,"I liked 'Jarhead' because it was a very good description of the soldier in the gulf war. Based on a true story, it portrays the traditional ground soldier as feeling unnecessary in the modern blitz tactics that our military employs. Another great point of the movie is that no matter what anybody does with the rest of their lives, they always have their unique experiences in the military as major, unforgettable events in their lives. It shows the good and the bad. It gives many different (and contrasting) points of view of the soldiers actually fighting and dying. Many expect another 'Blackhawk Down' or 'Saving Private Ryan' but it is not that. It is a real experience of men during the first gulf war and is an important movie to watch. Beware, it's mostly talking and not shooting. All in all, it was a refreshing movie that gave the realities of war that did not use elaborate fight scenes to keep the viewers occupied.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stop war!!!!,"Jarhead is a 2005 biographical drama military film based on U.S. Marine Anthony Swofford's 2003 memoir of the same name, directed by Sam Mendes, starring Jake Gyllenhaal as Swofford with Jamie Foxx, Peter Sarsgaard and Chris Cooper.""Jarhead"" (the self-imposed moniker of the Marines) follows Swoff, a third-generation enlistee, from a sobering stint in boot camp to active duty, sporting a sniper's rifle and a hundred-pound rucksack on his back through Middle East deserts with no cover from intolerable heat or from Iraqi soldiers, always potentially just over the next horizon. Swoff and his fellow Marines sustain themselves with sardonic humanity and wicked comedy on blazing desert fields in a country they don't understand against an enemy they can't see for a cause they don't fully fathom.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A year for auteurs,"Shyamalan claims that this is the worst year for film quality, and he may be correct, but it is also a year of directorial triumph. Haggis debuted with the startlingly contemplative ""blame everyone by blaming no one"" Crash, Foster gave us Stay, Chow did Kung-Fu Hustle, Cronenberg captured small-town secrets, Lucas finished his saga, and Ron Howard went under-appreciated. Now Sam Mendes adds this appropriately subdued power-house complete with stunning imagery, courageous casting, and timely discourse. Jake has gotten lots of buzz for his performance but it will be buried beneath Joaquin's Johnny and Viggo Mortensen's schizophrenia; still there is enough here to quiet his naysayers. Perhaps what I am struck by most is what William Broyles Jr. does not say in this script. How simply and succinctly he omits certain dialogue and lets the intense cast and ridiculous scenery tell the audience all that it has to know. There is so much to say in a movie like this, and whatever isn't screamed is whispered beneath AK shots, loud music, escapism testosterone and genuine emotion.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Iraqi War Picture,"Jarhead is a great movie by a great director Sam Mendes.I am not a huge fan of war movies, not as I was at least. But this movie gives us the view of the soldiers on standby immediately before engaging the enemy.In this particular case, the standby troops before the first Iraqi war. All the before action anxiety and bottled up testosterone is portrayed in a very realistic manner, with a superb performance by Jake Gyllenhaal.The trio made by Jake, Peter Sarsgaard and Jamie Foxx elevate the movie letting us see the hardships of soldiers constrained by politics.It is a very good war movie, in another very good example of Sam Mendes's work.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Boys Go to Late 20th Century R Rated War,"""Jarhead"" is a visually stunning celebration of making an R rated film about enlisted men, ground level troops from basic training through homecoming in a late 20th century war. And that's it.The first third is a repeat of every movie ever made about basic training, including ""Full Metal Jacket"" and even having Jamie Foxx channel Louis Gossett Jr. from ""An Officer and A Gentleman."" Just that now we get to hear a lot of variations of the ""F"" word in conversations and scatological marching chants. The squadron is even set up as the diversity of the new Army (there's an amusing interchange about unfamiliarity with author Anthony Swofford's Anglo-Saxon surname), as the inevitable kid from Compton now replacing the World War II stereotype of the boy from Brooklyn, with two Latinos, one dark, one light, with one a Cuba Libre proponent. That's just about all we learn about each of these guys, though at least we can tell them apart more than the guys in ""Black Hawk Down."" Peter Sarsgaard is mesmerizing but his character stays a bit of a mystery throughout.Are these any different than scenes from an Queda training camp would be? Just as generals fight the previous war (the lesson learned here was to have overwhelming force and popular support), these guys get hopped up on Viet Nam War movies, though the message of ""Apocalypse Now"" seems lost on them and there's only one plaint for their own music (there's actually surprisingly little hip hop on the soundtrack though Thomas Newman's soundtrack and other selections are very effective). ). This section is tedious and loses the audience too soon.The second third is the build-up to Gulf War I as it slowly changed from Desert Shield into Desert Storm, and which we at home knew a lot more about through CNN than these troops out in the desert did (and there's no sign of other members of the coalition), as they only get propaganda briefings a la the truism that the first victim of war is the truth.This scabrous section is basically Boys Gone Wild with Boredom, that veers close to HBO's ""Oz"" territory and you can practically smell the latrines and body odor. The R rating could have been pushed much further here, as the full extent of what isolated men are like together is covered clinically in the voice-over that is only useful in this section and is otherwise too annoying throughout. A beefed up Jake Gyllenhaal is explosive in representing the marines' disintegrating mental state. The military does seem to have learned some lessons from this readiness experience to keep troops in touch with home, as seen in the recently canceled FX series ""Over There."" The scenes of press interviews have lost a bit of punch since we've seen since embedded reporters.It is effective at showing how a brutal misogyny can develop in these situations (with a toss-off about fertility as a half-hearted balance) such that the women in their lives become The Enemy in the bitter ""Wall of Shame"" of cheating wives and girlfriends. (There's a nasty vignette of a wife turning her husband's fondness for ""The Deer Hunter"" back on him.) It's a small stretch to understand how in other cultures and at other places rape and pillaging could become a weapon of war as a release. (Homophobia is not dealt with.) War looks like a controlled outlet for testosterone.The third section is all about Roger Deakins' cinematography, from the blinding white out of the desert to the burning oil wells, to friendly fire and collateral damage. It is starkly beautiful.There are some political points here as gradually the sniper marines realize they are irrelevant in an air war, but we know that won't be the case in the Gulf War Part 2 that's now urban guerrilla battles. ""Three Kings"" was much better at combining the grunts' and the wider cultural and political perspectives, though there's some token discussion about dissent. The film reinforces another truism that troops in battle fight for their buddies, not for ideology (presumably in Queda as well).The concluding coda is heavy-handed, including the closing narrative point: ""All wars are different. All wars are the same."" ""Best Years of Our Lives"" made the same points and almost the same story lines.While Chris Cooper and Dennis Haysbert seem to get a kick out of strutting around as superior officers, I doubt the military can use this as a recruiting film, as there's brief points about inadequate equipment and risky issued drugs.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jarhead lacked Violence,"Jarhead was a very unique film. While most war films subject viewers to mass violence, Jarhead took the alternative rout and focused on a main character and his experiences. The storyline focuses on a young man with little to lose. His family basically abandoned him mentally so and all he really left behind was a two-timing girlfriend. He arrives at boot camp and is initiated by his bunkmates with a semi-beating. Afterwards he meets his drill-Sergent and they train, and go to war. The storyline was pretty generic, but above average. The movie kept me interested the whole time and the acting was great. I would recommend it to almost anyone. The only matter it lacked was violence, comon people; war films are supposed to include some kick-ass violence ...right? Maybe that was a contradiction but I hope you know what I mean.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
beauty in darkness,"This film draws more upon character build up than it does the story of war itself. If you enjoy identifying with a protagonist then you will enjoy this film. Also, I found it was visually stimulating, many of the shots were absolutely brilliant. At no point did I feel disturbed by some of the grotesque images i was seeing, but in fact could appreciate the cinematography and direction of those shots. Everything was beautiful, even the pain and darkness of the film. Don't walk into the theater expecting an edge-of-your-seat-thriller. I think that many people who do this will be disappointed. Approach it as reality, an accurate reflection of one man's experience, not a glorified view of wars. Also, it is important to really embrace Sam Mendes' style of editing. You will notice that he places a lot of emphasis on the long shot and mise en scene.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Anti-war?,"It's hard to decide whether JARHEAD, ostensibly about the Gulf War, is pro- or anti-war. What it really is about is the day-to-day life of a Marine, and that includes an awful lot of sitting around, waiting for something to do. Hurry up and wait, I believe is what they call it. Like sitting in the doctor's office for an hour, waiting to be examined for three minutes. But these guys never even get their three minutes. Even during the height of Desert Storm war, the Marines in this picture find they have little or nothing to do, as the war always seems to be two steps ahead of them. In this telling, based on the memoirs of ex-Marine Anthony Swofford, it turns out to be an air war, and our boys are stuck on the ground. In the end, the film is really about personalities, and for better or worse we have seen these same personalities in a hundred other war pictures. The best of those flicks has been and remains the first half of FULL METAL JACKET. Watch JARHEAD for Jake Gyllenhall as Swofford, a very different character from DONNIE DARKO, his best known role. Gyllenhall's costar, Jamie Foxx as a platoon sergeant, turns in a pale imitation of Lou Gossett in AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN. Chris ""Twin Peaks"" Cooper has a cameo as a commanding officer, but isn't given anywhere enough screen time to register. Dennis ""24/Allstate"" Haysbert shows up for about 10 seconds as another officer.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"'Gritty', yet 'dreamy' take on the effects war","Solid performances by Fox (enjoyble to watch as a marine-lifer)and Gyllenhaal make 'Jarhead' a worthwhile time at the theatre. Mendes's film made me recall many tales of war, yet puts a completely new spin on this genre. At times I felt as if he was paying homage to such films as 'Fullmetal Jacket' and 'Platoon' to even a Kurt Vonnegut novel (there are some interesting characters tied with elements of the surreal), however this movie feels differently due to the type of war Operation Dessert Storm was. I feel Mendes perfectly captures the psyche of these soldiers in the type of hurry-up-and-wait marine mentality of this war, by the time Gyllenhaal sees his first and only action we can feel the tension and release when he gets his call to duty. One of the strongest and most realistic aspects of this film is the way the soldiers act in the environment they are in. This movie is very gritty in this aspect, giving one of the most realistic portrayals of a soldier being isolated away from home, from missing girlfriends to going crazy due to the exhaustion of war in general. At times I felt as if this film moved as a documentary due to the dialogue between its characters, it seemed as if they were not working from a script, but real life conversations. I especially liked the dream sequence in which Gyllenhaal misses his girlfriend (he pukes sand as he stares at his girlfriend's reflection in the mirror), you can feel his anxiety of being away from a loved one. This movie is a solid portrayal of what this type of war or any war can have on a soldier's psyche, no soldier is the same after he has held his rifle, this film proves it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Gritty, realistic, tough first-hand account of U.S. Marines in Gulf War...","JAKE GYLLENHAAL contributes to the impression gained from other films that he's one of the hottest contenders for the cream of the crop of new actors on the Hollywood scene. His performance here is flawless and just plain brilliant.The novel was written by a man who served his time in the Gulf War and we see the story from his viewpoint as a U.S. Marine training for combat under arduous conditions in Iraq after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. The desert landscape looks as though it was filmed on actual locations instead of Mexico.The salty language is peppered with typical service jargon (plenty of vulgarity and ""f"" words tossed around), the kind that was never allowed in service films from the '30s to the '50s--which makes the whole thing ring true with even more authenticity than usual. Anyone easily offended will have to skip this one.While Gyllenhaal carries much of the film, CHRIS COOPER impresses in a brief role as a Lt. Col. and JAMIE FOXX is superb as a crusty Staff Sgt. whose only goal is to get his men into fighting shape. All of the supporting actors do amazingly well in roles that steer away from being the kind of stereotypes we're used to in service films. There's a wild unpredictability in the antics of the young men that comes from a superior script and enhanced by expert direction from Sam Mendes. Gyllenhaal is exceptional in his freaked out moment where he almost contemplates committing friendly fire on a buddy who lets the troop down. His temperamental and hysterical outburst is utterly convincing.The oil well scenes are strikingly photographed for maximum effect and there's a jauntiness to the background score that fits the wild antics of a bunch of boy/men who make up these fighting and playful Marines.Not a treatise on the Gulf War or the U.S. involvement in it, but simply a straightforward tale of what it was like for Anthony Swofford who wrote the novel based on his own real-life experiences.Highly recommended as an interesting look at men in stress under dangerous but sometimes boring combat conditions where some troops never even got to fire a gun.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
a good war story,alright I'm not gonna say that it was a great movie or i loved and all that bs. the movie was alright the story was great. i liked how it showed everyone getting boried and doing stupid s**t. i thought the direction was great and it kinda felt like platoon like it focused more on one squad then just the whole army. i actually didn't give a rats a** about the actors in the movie oh wow look they have two academy award winners woo-pie. all i really cared about was the story and the war. what really got me was that it was based on the first gulf war i thought it was based on the war going on now.i also liked the feel of the characters and how everything changed when they came back. that some people became bums and some became rich executives at company's and some just came back to a little job on the side. it kinda showed what war will do to you. it also showed the relationships with there spouses back in the states and if they stayed true or they just called it quits.all and all i liked this film and i give it a 8 out of 10,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Where was it going?,"Jarhead is by far the worst war film I have seen. I kept waiting for something to happen. If there are to be peaks and valleys in a storyline, this one was a flat line. The story didn't move, never went anywhere. Finally when something might happen, the sniper scene in the tower, it becomes a mind game again. I understand in real war that there is a lot of waiting for something to happen, but do we need to see this on film? If the director wanted to make a documentary he should have done that instead. What a waste of talent as the acting, editing and cinematography were superb. There are great film versions of Vietnam and WWII, this is NOT the film that will encapsulate the Gulf War. I actually found the short documentary on the DVD ""Men of War"" more interesting than the movie. Save your time on this one and wait for a real movie of the Gulf War to come out.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A war film about identity crisis and bordem,"A very entertaining and somewhat insightful story about the impact of US military training and modern wartime conditions on the soldiers involved. The film is very insular, focusing on the daily lives of US soldiers including Jake Gyllanhall as a low level soldier and Jamie Fox as his enthusiastic staff
Sergeant. The soldiers are portrayed as tightly coiled springs, increasingly eager for battle while struggling with challenges of loneliness and bordem. Sam Mendes clearly borrowed from other celebral war epics such as Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now and Platoon and there is a running theme of identity crisis as the soldiers struggle to escape the memories of former conflicts. Gyllanhall's character even asks ""why don't we have our own music?!"" in reference to Vietnam era rock being played by other soldiers, a line which seemed to relate to the film itself.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting,"I recently watched a fascinating war movie that caught my attention from the start. Having seen a plethora of war films over the years, I was eager to see how this one would stand out. However, I must admit that it felt rather lengthy at times, stretching my patience. Despite the challenges with its pacing, the movie held my interest throughout its duration.I found myself grappling with the overall concept, as some elements seemed obscured or difficult to grasp. Nevertheless, the film was definitely entertaining, and I genuinely enjoyed the experience of watching it unfold. I'm already looking forward to a second viewing, hoping that I'll gain a deeper understanding of its themes and nuances. This exploration into its layers is something I'm really excited about.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A third triumph for Sam Mendes,"Anthony Swoofford(Jake Gyllenhaal) tells the story of his experience while fighting in Desert Storm, beginning with boot camp to his training to be scout sniper to his experiences throughout the war and ending with his life after war.Jarhead probably stuck many as a heat-pounding war-action film and probably left many disappointed. Jarhead is about Desert Storm, a war that had very little action and Mendes stresses this constantly. The movie shows it's share of violence although the movie is more of a war drama such as The Deer Hunter, not Saving Private Ryan. I'm not saying that Jarhead was not entertaining, because it was extremely entertaining witch constant comic relief from Gyllenhaal and Foxx, but it was not the same kind of entertaining that is found in other war movies.With such an amazing cast of Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Foxx, Peter Sarsagard, and Chris Cooper, I was not disappointed with the quality of acting. Jake Gyllenhaal proves to be a great actor more and more with every movie he makes and the same goes for Jamie Foxx. The acting was convincing and flawless whereas the movie held one major flaw. It is only one flaw but it just bothered me intensely. The film was gigantically similar to Full Metal Jacket. It could easily be mistaken for a remake to some. The boot camp scene in the beginning was excessively similar and twice they used the same little chant used in Full Metal Jacket where the troops said ""This is my rifle, there are many like it..."" The themes of Jarhead and Full Metal Jacket were also similar, both saying that ""War takes average men and changes them into heartless killing machines."" Mendes stressed the idea of a marine never being able to change, even after the war.Besides a similarity flaw, the movie was flawless. For what Jarhead was meant to be, it was perfect. Jarhead will surely be considered one of the best movies of the year and also help bring the war genre back to where it was before The Great Raid. Overall, Jarhead is a great anti-war movie that is quite entertaining but a exceedingly intense at times. Besides being very closely related to Full Metal Jacket, the story is quite clever and original.I highly recommend this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Different type of war movie,"The movie is about life in the marines before and during the first Gulf War. Jarhead is supposed to be a ""true story"" and is based on a bestseller written by Anthony Swofford about his experiences in the Marines. Both the book and the film didn't met my expectations, perhaps because the portrait of the Marines did not seem plausible.Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal)is a brooding presence and someone with intellectual pretensions. He reads Camus while sitting on the toilet. Camus explored the practical consequences of existentialist philosophy and described the inherent absurdity of human life. He concluded that the meaninglessness of life can only be mitigated by moral integrity and social solidarity. Perhaps the Camus reference indicates that this is meant to be an existential war movie? Who knows?The U.S. Marine Corps is depicted as a somewhat dysfunctional organization despite its reputation as one of the world's elite fighting units. The marines are shown as young, fit, apolitical, excitable, immature and trigger happy. They indulge in humiliating induction rituals and carry out pranks on each other. They also like to fight and talk about sex. Anyone of a nervous disposition should avoid signing up. The officers seem like over-grown children. The antics of the troops seem far-fetched. I know a Marine who has served in Iraq, who told me the portrait is totally inaccurate. There is little resemblance to the stoic, hard-nosed men depicted in the John Wayne WW II movie ""Sands of Iwo Jima."" Mendes' Marines are fragile and almost on the verge of a mental breakdown.The war is over before our marines fire a shot in anger, but they return as conquering heroes. The film doesn't seem to have have an overt political message. Essentially there is no plot, and no denouement. Mendes is a skilled director and the acting is excellent. Although Jarhead is lively and the exploits of the marines are mostly entertaining, it's disappointing as entertainment.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stunning yet distant war film,"Jarhead, based on the memoirs of Anthony Swofford, is a technically superb yet thoroughly distant film. Based on a book whose whole premise is a literal catarthism of personal experience, Jarhead the film is let down by a lack of perspective or individual expression.The film starts well enough as Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) orates in voice-over the feelings associated with being a Marine, both during and after active duty. This monologue, conducted over a black screen, promises so much  this will be a film which tells story whilst extolling human emotion there in the heat of the battle (or non-battle as the case is in this film). Instead Mendes and scriptwriter William Broyles Jr dispense with narration. Understandably, narration bogs a film down, but here, where the account is based on an individual's own story, the audience yearns to know what is going through a 20-year old's mind as he prepares for war. This absence of a singular voice turns Jarhead into just another war movie: showing beefed up, frat-boy jocks displaced in a foreign land. While we can see the antics of the boys in the desert we are curiously at arms length from them. We do not inhabit the space that Swofford occupies as we are not 'inside' his head at all. Therefore, to the audience, Swofford the protagonist is just another grunt.The film is something of a post-modernist take on war films themselves. It unashamedly name drops the most famous war movies, either directly, with shots of the troops viewing Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter, or indirectly, with an obvious homage to Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket at the start of the film. In his book Swofford called war movies 'pornography for soldiers' and here Mendes shows us the grunts woop-wooping the infamous helicopter strike from Apocalypse Now. For these boys, all they want is action. For a brief moment, a scene so often marked as portraying the Americans as ""evil white men"", as so famously put by Pauline Kael, is flipped on its head. The seductive might and power of the American military is being triumphed and the audience becomes one with the soldiers. Yet again, this scene would have been best served by a voice-over from Swofford explaining his thoughts (I have not read the book, but he apparently talks of wanting to rape and pillage the villagers from that scene). If Mendes is already name-dropping and using Apocalypse Now as a reference point, why not follow Coppola's use of narration (so brilliantly written by Michael Herr)? It's a sore point of distance that lets down what could have been a great movie instead of just a good one.The performances are all strong. In fact as pieces of acting, both individually and as an ensemble, Jarhead is excellent. Jamie Foxx stands out as the brash Staff Sgt. Sykes, a tough but warm leader, while Gyllenhaal and Peter Saarsgard (as Troy, Swofford's sniping partner) also perform well. Gyllenhaal's character would have been more memorable had we been allowed deeper into his mind, but as such it is Lucas Black as Kruger, an unusually politically aware Texan, who stands out. His nuanced performance as someone obviously more aware than he appears helps make up for Gyllenhaal's spectre-like Swofford.While the script might not be watertight, Mendes excels in cinematography and editing. The Marines are stripped of colour as the desaturated images of boot camp and the desert make them appear pale and ghostly. Mendes' staging of the burning oil fields is the film's highlight; the Marines walk in bright sun towards a black sky, slowly becoming enveloped in crude oil. Mendes has used CGI in this section of the film, but it looks great. As a collection of images, Jarhead is brilliant. Audio quality is excellent too  the various aural instances help invoke the feel of military life in the desert.Mendes may have purposely avoided any comment about the current war in Iraq, oblique or obvious, to allow for better box office figures in the US. That's a cynical point of view however. This is Swofford's story and yes, there are scenes or dialogue that could references to the current situation  at one point Swofford says in voice-over, ""we are still in the desert""  but his point is not directed at the US, it's directed at his platoon and their enduring memories of the conflict. This is a movie about the Gulf War, nothing more. Anti-war media and commentators hoping Mendes would use this film as a protest platform will be disappointed. In the end, Jarhead is a good war movie, but one without a voice. It's a well-made, high quality film. It just fails to stir the emotions and make a genuine connection with the audience. For all its technical and visual brilliance, that is a real shame.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Apolitical does not mean empty,"Of the negative reviews I've read about this movie, a vast majority contain the comment that it omits the politics behind the war, and the barbaric nature of it. I think that is exactly the point. So many of us sit at home proselytizing about the meaning of war, but this movie is showing it on a much deeper level- the one confronted by the guys on the ground. It is a character study, and a fascinating one at that, if slightly limited. If one wants to see bombs and fight scenes, this wouldn't do it. However, I laughed out loud more than one time, and then felt disturbed but still humored. This type of reaction to me is good- indicative of a movie that elicits a response. There is no outright comment on the politics of war- don't we get enough of that?",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting and good - but unlikeable characters,"This was a good movie - not great, but good. I think the main reason for this is that I found it a little hard to identify with the lead character. He didn't seem very likable, respectable, wise or deep - any one of these would have helped. In fact, none of the characters seemed very appealing. Yet, the story and main character's experiences are generally interesting and engaging. Unlike other war movies, this one focuses on the pressures and tensions of the soldiers sent to fight a war. In this case it's for Operation Desert Shield/Storm. I found the seemingly realistic portrayal of what soldiers go through to be very interesting. This includes their dealing with feelings and doubts about relationships left behind, boredom, desire for combat, and tense interactions with others.What I ended up getting was a pretty interesting back story to a historical event. However, much of it felt empty - I just didn't like any of characters very much.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Terrible movie,"This movie is full of foul swearing with some gratuitous sex thrown in for good measure, and it's populated by characters with absolutely no depth. I was almost hoping some of them would be among the few who were killed during Desert Storm.I hope that people who have not been in the military don't conclude that this is a realistic portrayal of Marine Corps in combat. The behavior of the officers and senior enlisted men was totally uncharacteristic, and the lack of discipline displayed by the enlisted troops was outrageous.I wasn't at all clear to me what this movie was supposed to be about. If there was a message there that war is bad (or good), it went cleanly over my head.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

It is the ""Full Metal Jacket"" of the new millennium, which is a compliment!""Jarhead"" is based on actual events that happened during the Gulf war. We follow the true story of a Marine from boot-camp, to being thrown in the middle of Desert Storm.The story is top-notch, as we've come to expect from films like this. The cinematography is fantastic, as is the soundtrack. Brought back a lot of memories from high school for me. Some songs I haven't heard in years! The acting was great! Especially Jamie Foxx. Definitely one of his best performances! The film is violent, and not pretty. But nobody said that war was pretty. This is the truth, and sometimes the truth hurts. Also, quite a bit of swearing, some may find this offensive. I was in the military, and everyone did speak like the characters in the film, so it is realistic.This is a definite must see for everyone that loves war movies, or for the curious that would like to see one interpretation of the Gulf War.

Mendes hasn't reached his master-stroke with this one but he's made a good and memorable film all the same,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsAdapted from his own novel of his experiences during wartime, the film tells the story of Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) a young man who enlists in the army as the Gulf War takes off. Sent to a post in the desert with other members of his unit, they don't find a war taking place but just a need to be on constant alert. Their Staff Seargent Sykes (Jamie Foxx) trains them to be brutal killers in combat and a life or two was even lost in training- only for them to face nothing actually in the way of danger. The film becomes a study of how these men, namely Swofford, cope with the pressures of being on constant alert and the unbelievable boredom that breaks out as they sit around expecting the fight of their lives, only to return to a victory parade without having the honour of having faced any combat for their country.Brit director Sam Mendes hit it off with the unforgettably powerful American Beauty, but he followed it up a few years later with the gangster flick Road to Perdition, which, in my eyes anyway, was a bit under-whelming. This new film of his is shot in a style and told in a way that is unlike his previous two efforts, with a slightly more docu-drama style, some might say. It's a strategy that pays off, fairly well.The film has a few quietly absorbing moments to it, as well as a few powerful and disturbing scenes from lead star Gylennhaal. If only his co-stars were as good, unfortunately, they're mostly all wasted in supporting roles, most notably Chris Cooper. Foxx is commanding in a co-starring role but even he seems to have limited screen time.Unfortunately, the film is about boredom and, as such, sometimes the actual story itself tends to become a little dreary itself leaving the film a collection of great bits rather than a thoroughly brilliant whole. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

funny,"very very heavily influenced by full metal jacket, this hilarious take on the Persian gulf war of 1991 is entertaining as hell. sam mendes does a great job directing and the actors portray their characters nicely, but the greatness lies in the writing of the movie. not being familiar with the novel i'm not sure how much of the material came from the book directly, though i would suspect most of the narration is taken verbatim. three things that got me beyond the humor was the spectacular visuals towards the end of the film of the oil fields burning. it reminded me of Dante's inferno, or the book of revelations, literally a world falling apart. the second was the awkwardness of hearing music by nirvana in the movie. i don't know if this is the first movie to feature nirvana on the soundtrack, but it's the first i know of, and being a fan of the music, it sounded out of place. the final thing that got to me was the underlying theme of cuckolding. in the movie it insights paranoia and fear out of all. it seems all consuming in the movie. the deer hunter scene almost made me cringe with embarrassment and humiliation at how something like that must be emotionally and spiritually destructive. men tend to be territorial when it comes to the intimacies of their lovers, and in monogamous societies this is accentuated even more by the feelings of exclusivity that comes with pair bonding. in this light nothing could be more destructive to a man than his ""sanctuary"" being invaded. other than all that jazz though the movie was rather entertaining and a good watch, it shifts away from the gritty emotionalism of war movies like platoon and tigerland and stands side by side with kubrick's full metal jacket and catch 22 in the infinite absurdities in and of war.9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Significance? JARHEAD depicts the Bizarre DESERT STORM War,"Were intentions graded instead of product, then JARHEAD would be given 4 stars rather than 3, merely because it is one of the few films (so far) that shows the particular idiosyncrasies of that first Bush war, the DESERT SHIELD transforming into DESERT STORM. We have many films that document the mindset of the soldiers from the Civil War through the two World Wars, to Korean War to Vietnam War and each is different. JARHEAD is as much about the changes that have occurred in the American military with the advent of computerized warfare and sophisticated war machines and weapons as it is about the Greed for Oil Dominance that prompted the US Kuwaiti involvement. And for that this film is important and will remain so until something better comes along.The story is rather minimal and as narrated by the author of the novel on which it is based, Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), it takes a while to become airborne. Swoff is a disillusioned kid who can't figure out how to make life meaningful so he opts for the USMC as a staging zone in his growth. What he discovers is the usual boot camp mentality and training, encountering other men who have both similar and different reasons for joining the Corps: Troy (Peter Saarsgard) has dark issues that remain with him throughout the story; Kruger (Lucas Black) opted for the Corps instead of prison; Cortez (Jacob Vargas) needed money to support his pregnant wife; Cuban immigrant Escobar (Laz Alonso) sincerely is a grateful patriot, etc. Along the way the boys encounter the stereotype DI (Scott MacDonald), the Staff Sergeant (Jamie Fox) and the company commander Lt Col Kazinski (Chris Cooper) as well as the usual variety of testosterone provoked young kids successfully brainwashed to be 'fighting men'.The bulk of the story after boot camp is the boredom of going to war in the Kuwaiti desert, having nothing at all to do except play dumb games and wait and hydrate, until at last the Staff Sergeant gleefully announces Saddam Hussein is shooting and they are off to actually do what they were trained to do - Fight! But even that is thwarted as they wade through a miserable existence of seeing sky-darkened oil well fires, constant oil raining from the burning oil money holes, losing buddies to friendly fire and mistaken attacks by their own air support. And just at the point when this company of trained snipers (especially Swoff and Troy) gets the chance to kill, the 'war' is over and they go home. And in Swofford's narrative comments he notes how those men will never be allowed to leave the desert experience behind. 'Wars are different, yet wars are the same'.Jake Gyllenhaal, buffed and shaved headed, gives us everything Swoff represents - as far as the meager script and misguided direction by Sam Mendes allow. He is a fine actor and his range of emotions is what holds the film together. The remainder of the cast likewise does their best to make their shadowy character outlines from the screenplay by William Broyles Jr. as close to three-dimensional as the lines allow. Yes, the film is about a new kind of soldier, one less driven by patriotism and more informed about the commercial greed that drives these fiascoes, and Mendes does allow us to see that. But deeper character development and motivation could have made this a more powerful antiwar statement than a visual excursion of life under the sun of the foreign desert skies.

Military life in full....,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. As someone who has dated marines, naval officers, and soldiers. I knew what they go through on a daily basis, but it was good to see it in living color. The writing is brilliant. Jamie Fox's delivery is flawless as is Gylllenhaul's. It really put perspective to what happened in Dessert Storm. Nothing, A whole lot and nothing. Don't go to this film expecting lots of action. Because remember that is not what that war was about. It is however a great look at military life and the psychological issues soldiers go through abroad. It's a very appropriate film for this particular time.

"Not too much action, not a problem","If you're looking for two hours of explosions, detached limbs flying through the air, and blood and guts, then don't see this movie. You will be disappointed. ""Jarhead"" is not your typical war movie. Many great war movies of the past tell stories of soldiers almost going insane because of the violence and death they have been cast into. This film shows how being in war with the lack of any action at all can have the same effect.""Jarhead"" digs deep into its characters as it follows their quest for glory and war through Desert Storm. This quest begins to become an obsession as the soldiers are driven to their limits by boredom of waiting for their time to fight and the paranoia that their wives and girl friends at home are being unfaithful. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Tony Swofford, a marine sniper who, like his fellow soldiers, only wants a little taste of war to make up for all the miserable training he has gone through. ""Jarhead"" follows his psychological struggle through this hell on Earth. As he and his platoon camp in the deserts of Saudi Arabia, they find themselves engulfed in pointless repetition. They patrol the open desert looking for nothing, they practice shooting at nothing and their only sources of entertainment include a wall hanging with pictures of soldiers' wives and girlfriends who have cheated on them, perfecting the art of taking their rifle apart and putting it back together, and above all, a lot of masturbation. One of my favorite scenes is when a big group of soldiers are in a screening room watching the scene from ""Apocalypse Now"" where the Huey's bomb the life out of a Viet Cong camp. The look on the characters' faces resemble a child who has just seen Santa Claus flying across the sky in his sleigh.When the war finally starts, the only action that comes for them is bombs dropping from so far away that the enemy cannot be seen and all the soldiers can do is hunker down in their holes. Finally Swofford's chance comes when he and his spotter are sent on a mission to find and kill two Iraqi officers. Just as he has one officer in his sights he is told that he cannot shoot because an air strike is coming instead. His spotter, played by Peter Sarsgaard, begs for Swofford to be given the shot. When they are denied he finally breaks down in tears. I have to say, before ""Jarhead"" Jake Gyllenhaal had never impressed me in any role he had played. He turns it all around this time with an amazing performance, as does the supporting cast including Sarsgaard and Jamie Foxx as Sgt. Sykes.This film shows an ironic side to war. Being forced to fight can kill a man, but not being able to fight has its effects also. ""Jarhead"" shows that every war is different but even if you don't fire one bullet, war is war and it sticks with you forever. As Swofford says ""Every war is different, every war is the same.""",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
profoundly different from other war films,"This adaptation from the book by Anthony Swofford, a veteran from the first Gulf War, gives us insight into a world none of us has ever experienced (fortunately). The point of view this British director (known all over the world for ""American Beauty"") proposes is considerably unconventional, comparing this movie to others of this genre. The impact is not so strong, owing to the lack of action and entertainment, but Sam Menders has the intention of showing the political consequences of war actions and doesn't care so much about ""mere action"". The flick can certainly seem tedious, despite the first-class performances, but its originality consists just of the pshycological standpoint offered here.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"well-shot, but far from being memorable","""Jarhead"" is a well-shot military drama directed by Sam Mendes far-famed for his superb cinematic debut, ""American Beauty"". Going back to the subject. With lots of funny situations and interesting, well-matched musical score ""Jarhead"" provides a wonderful insight into military service. However, I felt that the director has not much to say throughout the movie. What is the biggest problem of the film is the lack of solid punchline at the end. The creators leave viewers practically with no thoughts except these ones indicating that military service involves a series of pointless actions and is dull. It definitely seems too little for a feature film and, therefore, the movie is anything but memorable.

"There's something happening here, what it is ain't exactly clear","It is impossible to watch ""Jarhead"" and not think about the current Gulf War. I realize the film takes place solely in the context of the first Gulf War, but you can't help but think about what's going on now.One of the most salient points this film makes - and I don't know if it was intentional - is a rather subtle one. Throughout ""Jarhead,"" director Sam Mendes and screenwriter William Broyles Jr. point out how many days these soldiers have spent in the desert and how many of them there are. For much of the film - as we very well know from facts from the first war - they readied themselves for the invasion of Iraq. When it finally comes, there's a title imposed on the screen telling us there are 575,000 troops on the ground.I'm not a fan of President George H.W. Bush, but, at least, he knew how to properly carry out an invasion. He listened to his military commanders. Cut to Gulf War: Part Deux, run by his not-too-smart and incompetent kid, and you realize how incredibly botched and poorly planned this Iraq War was and is. We went in with fewer than 200,000 troops. Thanks, Dubya.The point of ""Jarhead"" seems to be not that war is hell so much as that war can be downright boring, too. These are guys who are just itching to see some action, to blow some crap up. Instead, they're forced to wait, causing much frustration. In hindsight, of course, the waiting game seemed to make us better prepared. We, at least, seemed to have a plan then. And we didn't manufacture false WMD evidence or say that we needed regime change to oust a brutal dictator who, true, killed thousands, but was also one of our biggest allies and buddies when he did most of those killings, something no one in this administration or in the media ever points out.The trouble with ""Jarhead"" is the soldiers' frustration can't really carry the whole film. Jake Gyllenhaal is awfully good as Anthony Swofford, waiting for his first sniper kill, and Peter Sarsgaard, again, turns in a wonderful low-key performance. This chap truly is fast becoming one of our finest film actors. But the rest of the cast, including Jamie Foxx and Dennis Haysbert, wind up in mostly throwaway roles. And many of the supporting characters seem cookie-cutter.The film delves into the daily grind of the soldiers and their commanders' plans to keep the boys busy while awaiting the invasion. It's all about doing something to prevent from going stir crazy. But I really don't know if it makes for captivating cinema.As beautifully shot, well acted and competently directed as ""Jarhead"" is, there were many times I wondered why exactly Mendes wanted to make this movie. If his point, indeed, was that war is boring, that is made abundantly clear early on. But there needs to be something more to a movie, too, and this one just didn't have it.I'm glad I saw this movie, but I wanted more. I didn't want to be as bored as the soldiers were and, often, that's exactly how I found myself.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not bad, but not bright","What struck me in the very beginning of the movie was that it looked like an absolute Full Metal Jacket ripoff. It is not such a thing, because as we progress to the end the movie distances itself a lot from that. I do believe that it's interesting because it portrays the state of the US army: a bunch of young, confused kids who know very little about what they're fighting for and who their enemy is, and are enraged against their enemy and driven to hate him, even without knowing him. Trained as to kill for fun, but not used to killing & seeing death, and breaking down nervously really fast. Unexperienced in most aspects of life - including personal - most seemed to have picked girlfriends which dumped them in the first 2 months after they left. Why, then, does the US win wars? Easy, because they don't fight wars, not real ones. They pick on some poorly trained poorly equipped nations and slaughter both themselves and the enemy in the process of war. That's it, a sad story.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
kind of movie that keeps sticking in your head afterwords!,"I think this is a very good movie,one that goes much further psychologically than other war movies. There is a scene that I will never forget; a bunch of marines are seeing Apocalypse now and they are cheering like madmen at the famous scene of helicopters flying over a Vietnam beach going to destroy a village. At first, you tell yourself nae, this is greatly exaggerated but then again, with all the training and the brainwashing they had, you tell yourself, this must be true! Is this antiwar propaganda? It all depends on where you stand. Sam Mendes is truly a genius, I think. For any Marines past or present who may be reading this message, I want to know. When you get abused in training camp don't you just want to kill your training officer if only for a few seconds? I know I would.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Thank you Jamie Foxx,"To say this movie Delivered the Goods is a gross UNDERSTATEMENT. I saw this movie on a Saturday at 10:30am, which is early for a MOVIE. I loved it. It reminded me of the days at New Mexico Military Institute and how tough Marine Boot Camp it. I suggest seeing this movie. I was not in the gulf war but I am an era veteran. I was fully aware of all that was going on. What the deal was is that it was VERY BORING to sit in the desert for 150 days with nothing to do. Jamie Foxx is a great S/SGT and did a first rate job. His HOORAH line is destined for the shelves that house ""I don't give a damn"" and ""Luke, I am your father"". This will go in my inventory of must have movies. Jake Gyllanehall was good also. He must have worked out a lot. President Palmer also did a good job when he took his morning glory. All in all, a great flick with a lot of memories for somebody like me, who went to New Mexico Military Institute with Owen Wilson. Was this movie PROPAGANDA AGAINST THE YOUNGER GEORGE BUSH? No, but who needs that propaganda when George is now digging his own grave. He started out good, now he's just a stooge.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A war movie...without the war?,"Jarhead is a 'behind the scenes' war movie, if ever there was one. We follow the military career of Swofford, who progresses through boot camp and scout/sniper school and eventually winds up in Iraq serving in Desert Shield.If you're looking for action packed scenes and lots of special effects, then you may want to pass on this film. This is more about the life of a soldier in the Corps than actual firefights and explosions. There are relatively few battle scenes in the film, and it spends more time in the barracks and in camp than on patrol. Not necessarily a bad thing, mind you, but it may not be what some people expect when they see this movie.I enjoyed the look at life behind the front lines perspective in the film. Watching this without reading anything about it, I didn't know what to expect. Honestly, I was hoping for more action; it is based on the Gulf War and everything I remembered seeing (trailers, etc) showed a platoon on patrol in the war zone. That's not the way the movie played out, at all.It's 123 minutes long, a bit stretched out, in my opinion. There are parts of the movie that drag on longer than they need to. All in all, though, it's a movie worth watching. Just don't go into it expecting a shoot-em-up thriller, and you won't be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Summercamp for grown ups,"Take out the guns, and the desert, and this is a summercamp movie. If you want to see a movie about being lost. This is it. I'm pretty sure the director was lost also. And you'll definitively be lost when its over. Aside from the shots that were obviously ""inspired"" by other war movies, i didn't see much great cinematic moments in this film at all, and i fail to see how this will somehow become a ""classic"". This movie vaguely wanders from ""war is hell"" to ""brotherhood"" to whatever else it was trying to say, and never delves fully into anything. And i don't feel it touched the ""war is hell"" subject out of any honest philosophizing or self-questioning, but rather just because its expected to be seen in a war movie. The most *annoying* part of the film i find has to be the ""summercamp movie"" style soundtrack, as in whenever there is any action you'll hear an ultra cheesy song start playing really loud. It really breaks the almost-spirit of this movie. A major failing of this movie is i was completely unable to feel any empathy for any of the characters. What was i supposed to feel? Pride? they walked around a desert and did a lot of push-ups...so what. Sadness? about what? that they didn't get to kill anybody? That the guy lost his sweetheart girlfriend? yeah cause breakups only happen to marines. The scene at the end was horrible. Where he stares off into the distance and remembers his ""bortherhood""... once a marine...always a marine.. What?? You didn't bond in war! you bonded dancing naked in your tent, getting drunk and jacking off!! You don't miss the marines, you miss your little frat party. You miss summercamp. In the end, i think the director just wanted to make a war movie without having anything to actually say. He watched a lot of war classics, scribbled down the recipe and tried to make his own, but it came out very flat and dry.gave it 4 stars. 1 star for the main character acting, 3 stars for the cool cinematography.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Felt irrelevant,"The movie doesn't seem to have any bearing on what's going on right now. The whole thing revolved around creating these hardcore fighting machines, and then when they get their chance to kill, to ""perform"", they are forced to stop, thus, prevented from shooting their proverbial load.Who can relate to this film in the current global climate? Soldiers are killed and see action over there. That's a reality going on TODAY. As a movie experience, it had it's moments and decent scenes, but overall it was boring. And the characters filled little more than a cliché mold - we had the troublemaker, the family man (Hispanic of course), the hard but wise sergeant, the troubled partner, and last but not least, the thoughtful white educated narrator leading us through it with slivers of wisdom and compassion. Man, didn't these guys see Platoon? Give me a break.",,Anonymous,Biography
a pleasant surprise,"i had no interest in seeing jar head.judging by all the previews,i thought it would be just another boring war movie,at best.however,my buddy had taped it so we decided to give it a try.after all, we had just sat through the train wreck that was silent hill,and it couldn't be any worse.turns out, it was quite a well done movie.its depiction of a company of marines and their lives, during dessert shield and dessert storm,was, i'm sure, an accurate portrayal of military life.giving this movie extra credence is that it is adapted from a novel by Anthony Swofford, who was himself a marine during both dessert shield and dessert storm.The book and the movie chronicle his experience during that time.and while the producers may have taken some dramatic liberty,i believe it does stick close to the facts.Jake Gyllenhall does well as the title character,and Jamie Foxx is very strong as Staff Sgt.Sykes his,commanding officer.Peter Sarsgarrd is also strong as Troy, a fellow marine and friend.and i can't forget Chris Cooper who has a small and memorable role as well,which he infuses with his usual brilliance.I believe the filmmakers did a good job depicting life as a marine waiting for action in Kuwait.the film is well paced, and tightly directed,with very few unnecessary scenes.there are also touches of humour injected into the film.for a movie of this genre,it is surprisingly lighthearted for the most part.it did not feel heavy handed at all,and did not have the cloud of depression hanging over it as most war themed movies do.it did have its dramatic moments of course, but these moments did not oppressively choke the film.all in all, a solid,entertaining piece of work.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A superficial but entertaining reflection,"Initially, like the protagonist, it is difficult to adapt to military training. Then, on the battlefield the narrative can be logical: a group of young men living together around the clock under the rules that have recently formed them, but which are necessarily broken from time to time. However, there is still a past life, something before, which each has to carry in his own way, waiting to return at some point but which in the end, when one is back, results in the desire to want to return to the battlefield. Apparently one lives longing for the past, even if it is close, it seems that the present is only enough to live it when it becomes the past and the present is only nonconformity.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Above Average movie and pretty good.,"Jarhead was pretty good. The sound seemed a bit off to me but that may have just been our theater. Anyway, I loved all of the actors that were in the film. The acting was great. It was comical and intense at times. The movie didn't seem to go anywhere but I think that may have been the point since it was such a short 'war'. Definitely a story worth telling. It's not a war movie like Full Metal Jacket, no really complicated characters, and not a lot of blood. I liked the way it was shot, nothing hokey or ground breaking that I noticed. Go see it, you may like it. If you don't see it at the theater you should definitely rent it when it comes out.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Intriguing thought provoker about a Jarhead who got lost on the way to college...,"JARHEAD - 8/10.First of all I'm not a massive fan of war films. Sure I loved Saving Private Ryan and Full Metal Jacket etc. but honestly films like Pearl Harbour and Black Hawk Down have never seemed appealing to me personally, no idea why. The only reason I watched Jarhead was because of a recommendation from a friend and it far exceeded my expectations.This is not an action film. There are bits that have small action elements to them but Jarhead is not full of explosions and gunfights by the minute. If you are a fan of 'high-octane' action films please do not be put off by this. I cannot stress enough how the fact that just because this isn't a fast paced film means that it is boring. Jarhead is far from boring.The reason I enjoyed it so much is the fact that (possible spoiler ahead) the heroes were not actually heroes; they did not get a big battle at the end and they far from went out with a bang. Even someone who isn't a Jarhead like myself understands that this is the reality of war and I think the writers embrace that. That being said some parts of this film really start to make you think and chances are you will be put out of your comfort zone with some of the emotions you feel during this film because there is such a perfect blend between the comedy and drama, you will feel disturbed, you will feel excited and you will be moved.The acting is very good, not ground-breaking but Jake Gyllenhaal does a good job at breaking down when he needs to. To summarise Gyllenhaal plays a Jarhead by the (nick)name of Swoff and the film is really a psychological journey through his time in the marines and how he deals with various scenarios - good and bad.If you, like me are a fan of well-crafted films that make you feel then Jarhead is for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Weak,"Watered down remake of Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"", with linear plot and card-board cut characters. If this move was supposed to be a depicting of American troops on first Gulf War, were are the female troops, the cultural shock with the eastern culture and way of life ? Afert all, did America fought this war alone ? Where are the other coalition troops ? If they are stationed on Saudi Arabia, where are the Arabs at all ?? It's strange that the only good movie done to the present date depicting Gulf War was ""Three Kings"", even though been a fictional piece, had a more wheel structured plot and more developed charactersAll in all, I think ""Jarhead"" worth a DVD run on a lazy Sunday afternoon, and nothing more.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very Moving,This isn't just any run of the mill war movie...This movie is about operation desert storm but from the point of the marine most war films symbolise the marine as some hardcore killing machine and this starts out no different but as the film goes on you become to feel sympathy for the marine...This sheds a whole new light on war the bits in between the fighting and the bonds the characters share.The film does lack some elements that make a good war film but otherwise a solid watch.Most probably Jake gyllehaals best film and a truly moving film.8/10,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The last in a terrific trilogy,"The Hurt Locker, Brothers, and Jarhead. In that order.Chronologically, you'd move Jarhead to the starting position. But the final scene in Jarhead cannot be topped. So I choose it as the end of this ad hoc desert war trilogy.I avoided this film when it was first released. From the trailer, it seemed like it would be a predictable gung-ho ad for the Marines. And it was shunned by any major awards. My, how everyone was wrong. This film was a victim of miscalculated ads and PR. Those looking for The Sands of Iwo Jima were disappointed, and those who would enjoy a character study with more questions than answers were scared away.The actors in the film are outstanding. Chris Cooper doing another Marine, after American Beauty. Jamie Foxx before the Ray Charles Oscar, and Jake Gyllenhaal before Brokeback, for example.This is not an action/war movie. It is beautiful, thoughtful, and message-free. It doesn't explain Why. You supply that answer, if you can.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The real tragedy of the military is the waste of all that young testosterone....,"...Whew, lengthy summary there, but that about sums up my gut reaction to this film. There's a lot in ""Jarhead"" that may seem mysterious to someone who was never a young male who signed up for one of the branches of armed service, especially with the expectation of going to war shortly. The bulk of this movie takes place between the summer 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq and the following spring when our massed forces simply rolled over the Iraqi trenches, burying thousands of them alive (this rightly isn't depicted in ""Jarhead,"" since it wasn't witnessed by the guy who wrote the book on which the movie is based) before stopping short from ousting Saddam Hussein because Bush Senior and his crew (including Dick Cheney) correctly believed that it would lead to chaos and a Vietnam-like morass for us. (This of course didn't stop Bush Junior and his crew (including Dick Cheney) from getting us into exactly that situation twelve years later, but that's been dealt with before....) In a nutshell, ""Jarhead"" depicts all these young gungho Marines going nuts because they're not permitted to do their job, i.e. engage and destroy the enemy through fire and maneuver, or more bluntly: kill people and break things. An ""ordinary person"" may think ""So what's the problem? They're alive and well,"" etc. To the extent ""Jarhead"" has a flaw, it's that it simply relies on the realities about which the real Mr. Swofford wrote. If the viewer doesn't ""buy into"" that, then the movie won't succeed for him/her.One of the many things I liked about ""Jarhead"" is that it's NOT about politics, at all. When one Marine character tries to bring that up (""We're here fighting for the oil companies,"" etc.) another character cuts that short: ""We're here now. Everything else is bull---t."" Both are correct. The character whose line that is, played by the intelligence-exuding Peter Sarsgaard, is if anything the most intelligent of the group, also the most cynical and the most gungho; in a cruel twist of fate, he's the only one of them other than the sergeant who wants to be a Marine for life, but they won't let him stay because he lied about having a criminal record.If director Sam Mendes has succeeded at his task, then by the time you get to what I regard as the climax, with the two snipers finally ready to consummate their mission by shooting the Iraqi officer in the tower, you'll fully understand and embrace their reaction when that gets taken away from them. If your reaction is similar to that of the asshole Major, then I guess Mendes has failed, and maybe should have just presented it as a straight documentary.Some random plug points: Sarsgaard stands out in an exemplary cast; his part is not so large as to preclude a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for him. The photography admirably transforms southern California and Mexico into Kuwait and Iraq, aided of course by the inevitable computer graphics. The scene with the Marines encountering the ghost convoy with the burned and blackened corpses is suitably eerie, although I wish movies would quit showing people vomiting on-screen because they can't get the projectile nature of it right; it looks like people spitting something out, not something being forced out. (Whenever I've had to throw up, I felt like the poor sap in ""Alien,"" only not through the chest of course.) Nice to see a war movie occasionally acknowledge ""friendly fire,"" such as that which took the life of former NFL star Pat Tillman. Near the end I liked the line ""We won't have to come back here..."" letting the sad irony just briefly resonate. The scene with the jar heads getting engrossed in ""Apocalypse Now"" was just brilliant (at Fort Benning I knew a guy who had the dialog from that one memorized). Minor quibble: the scene with Swofford threatening the other Marine at gunpoint in the tent was the only one that felt somewhat ""staged,"" where Jake Gyllenhaal seemed to be ""acting."" Like Matthew Modine in ""Full Metal Jacket,"" he has to carry the movie playing a character who seems not always believable even though (or maybe because) it's based on a real person. Somehow Mr. Gyllenhall's Swofford is always either too much of a ""wise guy"" or not enough of one....That brings me to my semi-final point: yeah, I know ""Jarhead"" reminds people of other movies, especially ""Full Metal Jacket,"" especially early on. That couldn't have been avoided anyway, but it fits with the motif of these young guys living in the shadow of Vietnam. (""That's Vietnam music,"" Gyllenhaal laments at one point, ""can't we have our own music?"") If anything I credit Mendes with making the Vietnam analogy less overbearing than I probably would have done myself. (The government did learn one thing from 'Nam though, nowadays they don't let us actually see our dead or wounded if they can prevent it.) One final quibble: ""Jarhead"" makes no reference to ""Gulf War Syndrome"" which (unsurprisingly) the Veterans Administration has been trying to downplay as much as possible, but maybe that wasn't in Mr. Swofford's book which I confess I haven't read.I have an unhappy hunch that ""Jarhead"" may suffer the same fate as ""Blackhawk Down,"" another painfully meticulous rendition of an episode in our military history that we just seem to want to forget. But those two will, I believe, be in the pantheon of (anti)war movies some day, along with ""Paths of Glory"" and ""A Midnight Clear"" and a few others. Maybe the best scene in ""Jarhead"" is with the graying Vietnam veteran on the bus with the young studs staring at him politely but quizzically. ""All wars are different; all wars are the same,"" kids shooting their youthful vim/vigor wad at the behest of the ""stupid white men""....",,Anonymous,Biography
"Bullets, bullets everywhere, but not a shot to shoot","JARHEAD (15) DIR: SAM MENDESIn case anybody was unsure, war is apparently hell. Just ask Captain Benjamin Willard in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979). Or Private Chris Taylor in Oliver Stone's Platoon (1986). Not to mention Private Ryan. Hell even Forrest Gump told us that (But you ain't got no legs... etc etc). So why do we need to learn this again? Going into Jarhead, all that was on my mind was that it was the new film from the director of American Beauty, starring the man from Brokeback Mountain (which I loved). So even if I already knew that war was indeed hell, I might as well hear their side of it, not being familiar with Anthony Swofford's novel.The film starts out showing the various dehumanising techniques that the grunts go through. Incredibly nasty drill instructors sapping any spirit that these young pretenders may have had, the main character then doubting his decision to join the marines, and of course, lots of boisterous marines behaving impetuously. Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his friend Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) are training to become snipers. To them it's great. A chance to finally see some action. Instead of being behind a desk doing mindless office work. But once the war starts, the action seems to have taken a vacation. And that's what Jarhead is all about. The banality of modern war, and the obsolete soldier who is sent to fight it.The motif of Jarhead is pretty similar to the war films that we have already been enduring ever since the end of Vietnam. There was nothing in the opening twenty minutes that I hadn't seen in Stanley Kubrick's overlooked Full Metal Jacket (1989). At the beginning of the film the protagonist is somewhat reserved. An apprehensive intellect who reads Camus and is doing his duty in light of his father, who served in Vietnam. As the film goes on, he is eventually one of the boys, and to some degree is in fact a leader to the boys, which made me think of Platoon (1986). Even David O. Russel's superior Three Kings (1999) covers a lot of themes being discussed by Sam Mendes.The cast are all very good. Jake Gyllenhaal now has the tag of the intellectual leading man. Jamie Foxx is hitting so many high points at this point in his career it's hard to believe he used to do Saturday Night Live. But the film's biggest strengths lie in it's cinematography and it's black humour. There is one scene in which the soldiers sit down and watch Apocalypse Now with sadistic and ironic glee. These are men who want to fight, but don't need to. And as such, end up driving each other mad. The modern soldier is not one who is pelted with bullets and fights his way through the mud. As the protagonist says in his voice-over ""There is no solution for mental unbalance"". It is not anti-war, nor is it pro-war. It is merely questioning the position of the modern soldier. He is taught the love his rifle, and to be prepared ALWAYS. But for what? Where is the danger? And in the heat of the desert, with his fingers itching over the tempestuous trigger, what is he to do? There is one scene later in the film where a Vietnam war veteran jumps on one of the parading trucks with all the marines. He tearfully embraces the soldiers, and congratulates them on winning. It is perhaps the darkest, and yet funniest moment in the film. Vietnam was a both a mental and physical hell. Kuwait was a mental and physical bore fest. And whilst a film about boredom never looks good on paper, Sam Mendes has done enough to make it both engaging and insightful, even it is reminiscent of superior work gone by.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastic overlook on a soldier's perspective 7/10,"Jarhead is not a simple and avenge war movie, it is a movie that shows the audience the perspective of a soldier during war. How he reacts to things, how he behaves, how slowly he becomes mad and loses himself. In many ways it reminded me of ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Apocalypse Now"". The movie is based on a book of a former US marine so the audience get a small look at the reality that was going on in the gulf war. Jake Gyllenhaal is fantastic and plays a soldier who's whole point of view over the war is portrayed fabulously. Jamie Foxx never disappoints in any role and shows a great performance. The cinematography of the film in the second half is fabulous, so many great shots and dark colors to capture the fear of the viewers. The scenes where the soldiers were on tours and overlooking the surface were shot beautifully, moments of tension and struggle. Overall it is a fantastic movie that gives us the perspective of a soldier.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Overall decent,"Jarhead was a decent movie overall, it was well put together and constructed and the visuals were very well done. Someone else commented that it was similar to Platoon, but it seemed to be more reminiscent of Full Metal Jacket than Platoon. The characters seemed a little flat, and I found it hard to become involved with the movie. The pace and the efforts of the cast did much more than the director (Sam Mendes) did for the movie.As a side note, American Beauty was not one of my favorite films, it didn't draw me in, and I've had that problem with many of Mendes' films, I consider Road to Perdition his best one.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""Welcome To The Suck...OORAH""","Jarhead (the self-imposed moniker of the Marines) follows Swoff, a third-generation enlistee, from a sobering stint in boot camp to active duty, sporting a sniper's rifle and a hundred-pound ruck on his back through Middle East deserts with no cover from intolerable heat or from Iraqi soldiers, always potentially just over the next horizon. Swoff and his fellow Marines sustain themselves with sardonic humanity and wicked comedy on blazing desert fields in a country they don't understand against an enemy they can't see for a cause they don't fully fathom.Jarhead is a war movie that actually doesn't have that much war shown in the film. Without any political statements to make, Jarhead simply tells the story of a solider in the war, who desperately wants to kill someone, something, anything. In order to let the madness go away from the unsettling nervousness one would have in a situation like this. So don't see this movie to see some politics because Sarsgaard said it best. ""F*ck politics...it's all bull****, it doesn't matter. We're here now."" The opening of the film is brings us back to the day when we first saw a film titled ""Full Metal Jacket"" and while the rest of the film also makes a comparison to it, it is able to distinguish itself as refreshing.What makes Jarhead so interesting to watch is not the fact that they have to battle an enemy, but rather themselves when they have no one to kill. When your sent to war with all the training and skills to kill an individual and are not able to, it will make you go crazy. So when the opportunity finally comes up for Swoff he jumps at the chance, although when that opportunity is taken away from him at the last second, the sniper scouter, Troy, literally breaks down. This is the stress that the soldiers must constantly go through every day out there. For the soldiers there are only a few outlets for this stress.Gyllenhaal has the usual soldier goes crazy scene, but here it is compelling and not clichéd. You do not know what the outcome will be, which surprisingly is unique. Then again it could be the fact that Gyllenhaal plays crazy so well...Donnie Darko anyone? From here till the Oscars, I'll wear my Sarsgaard for Supporting Actor Pin. For a character who says welcome to the suck every ten minutes, Sarsgaard is able to give a charismatic and electric performance. Foxx plays the prick drill Sargent, he's rough and crude and plays it to a tee. While Foxx has the flashier supporting part, it's Sarsgaard who is more gripping and will ultimately get the recognition.Mendes has a few ""artistic"" shots, that are pleasing to the eye. Like the shadows of two soldiers sitting in front of a red/orange sunset, or a soldier standing, while the oil burns behind him.Powerful and humorous is what Jarhead is, and it can join fight club on the list of guy movies. When every soldier watches the most famous scene from Apocalypse Now, you get pumped up yourself. You get attached to these soldiers and when the one soldier watches ""Deer Hunter"", you can't help but feel the sorrow that he feels. Or even when Gyllenhaal gets the unexpected 'welcome home' from his girlfriend.With the final 10 minutes of the film, it tries to throw an emotional punch at you, but misses. It would have hit, if it were not in a montage, but centred more on the topic at hand. If it does punch you, it's a light one because it comes and goes so fast. With no explanation at all. Jarhead is a movie with powerful performances and a great eye behind the camera. It's raw realism owes itself to the book that it was based on. Jarhead goes into the category as one of the few movies that makes me want to read the material that it was made from.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Too,"Basically the opening scene is the same as the great ""Full Metal Jacket"" but doesn't have the same war appeal and loses interest easily with lack of killing and lack of point...

Sitting through the movie made me want to kill myself and make it over!! Waste of my $10.00 I'd recommend waiting for it to come out on DVD or the shifty black market!

Somewhat generic but has its moments,"Jarhead (2005) the war drama film starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx, sees a group of marines and their quest search in battle. The film at the time seemed to have been praised widely but as time has passed and now over a decade since it's release, this film doesn't seem as great as it was when it came out. Reason being, there have been many more quality and better war/marines/solider films such as Jarhead.Though this film is not bad, it somewhat feels generic and lacking of complete emotional balance. The performances are their but the general tone of the film seems to resemble and MTV based film rather than a serious awards type film (such as the Hurt Locker or Hacksaw Ridge). Also mentioned that this film is not just a War film, it is able to mix some comedy and drama, with such issues as Mental health. The cinematography is great and Sam Mendes' direction is holds up but in general, something about the film feels lacking.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Full of references, ""Jarhead"" do not go deep in political questions. Instead, shows that the lack of ""action"" does not spare the young soldiers from psychological consequences","Based on the autobiographical book by Anthony Swofford, the film follows his experience in the US military, from his training as a sniper to the long months he spent in Saudi Arabia waiting for the start of a war that, when it came, lasted only 4 days. For infantrymen, as it was decided by air strikes and missiles fired from military bases. Thus, replacing the muddy confrontations of Vietnam, Swofford (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) faces the heat of the Gulf desert while dealing with endless boredom. However, the lack of ""action"" does not spare the young soldiers from psychological consequences - and the very anticipation of the start of battles is responsible for creating, in those young men, a dangerous emotional instability.The film has a beginning inspired by ""Full to Kill"". Both start the narrative from the barracks and the ""manly"" preparation that is done there - starting with the haircut at the barber and the classic oath of the rifle (""This is my rifle, there are many alike but this one is unique, yadda yadda...""). Swofford, like Matthew Modine's Joker cadet in '87, participates in this catechism with cynicism. However, pressure from an intransigent superior - the cartoonish R. Lee Ermey then, the stylish Jamie Foxx (Ray) here - does not take long to double the newcomer's intellectual resistance. In both films, the training phase ends with an unforeseen death - a narrative resource that marks the end of innocence.Then the film takes on personality with the arrival of Sergeant Sykes (Jaimie Foxx), who sees, in Swoff, a potential candidate for one of the eight marksman vacancies in his platoon - and one of his first lessons to aspiring assassins is, appropriately enough, , a savagely ironic comment on the nature of this crime. It's a cynical and inhuman lesson, of course, but consistent with the army's ruthless logic - after all, you don't want your killers to question the morality of murder, do you? Thus, when they are finally shipped to the Gulf, the boys are already infected by a mentality that equates machismo and coldness with concepts of virility and heroism.And there goes Swofford and the other ""jarheads"" - nickname of the US recos, due to the thin haircut - for a few days of triumphant marches over the enemy. At least that's what they imagine. The coincidences with Vietnam (and with Kubrick) stop there. The grouping of which Swofford is a part is tasked with protecting oil wells in Saudi Arabia. Non-stop running? Ammunition unloaded by the kilos? None of that. The first bearded Bedouin, worried about the death of a camel, only appears after an hour or so of film. And no sign of Iraq's Insane Sodom, as Foxx's sergeant dubbed dictator Hussein.Conditioned to face the ""enemy"" as the center of a target (which, by releasing its ""pink stain"" - blood -, will prove the soldier's worth), they confuse patriotism with xenophobia - and, in one of the most terrifying moments of the film, appear vibrating, almost in a collective ecstasy, as they watch the air raid commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore in Apocalypse Now (my reference to Kurtz at the beginning of this analysis therefore has other motives), which demonstrates not only complete misunderstanding about the theme of that masterpiece, as highlighted by the murderous rage generated by the training they underwent. Thus, killing - as will be seen later in the film - becomes not just an obligation, but a prize, a way of compensating them for everything they have faced. And it is not a question, in this case, of inflicting death through the impersonal push of a button, as in modern wars, but of seeing the enemy's face through the telescopic sight and witnessing the moment of impact of the projectile ('So that's how they look alike! ' comments Swofford, when he finally sees the enemy through his rifle scope for the first time.)And what's the point of so much death and destruction, anyway? Prevent the ""spread of communism""? Overthrow a dictator? Or, as one of the protagonist's companions sensibly perceives, to protect the oil fields that are of great interest to the United States? Whatever the reason, it is impossible to deny that, from the moment the war begins, this ceases to matter: staying alive is fundamental and is an instinct that is part of human nature; therefore, politics must be left aside (by the soldiers, perhaps, but never by society - the film ""Syriana"" makes a brilliant questioning of these political and economic motivations that lead to so much blood).Unfortunately, ""Jarhead"" seems only concerned with analyzing the psychological instability of its characters, forgetting, in the process, to comment on how the situation that leads to this instability is generated: with the exception of two or three very brief comments about the politics behind the armed conflicts, the film ignores the issue, as if those boys lived in a universe where Washington does not exist. And, by investing in humor as a way of establishing the absurdity of Swofford's experiences (and believe me, the feature is surprisingly humorous), director Sam Mendes runs the risk of making the discussion excessively light. In general, it's an interesting, well-made and entertaining film: the uncompromising way it deals with the material, after all other films have treated the subject brilliantly before, as in ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Born to Kill"", "" Platoon"", ""Born on the Fourth of July"", ""Tigerland"", among others.However, screenwriter William Broyles (Cast Away, The Polar Express) seems to give too much credit to the Army: there is a soldier, for example, who insists on questioning superior orders, demonstrating clear distrust regarding the motivations of his officers and the government and, however, nothing happens to him: he is orally scolded (if much), but never subjected to any kind of retaliation, as if the US military were an institution that values freedom of expression above all else (something the film itself discard). By the way, even the punishments imposed on Swofford and his companions are portrayed in an amusing way, which lightens the picture for the viewer. To make matters worse, what should supposedly be the main theme of the film is boycotted by a basic misunderstanding: how can we understand the psychological damage caused to Swofford, who goes through a clear process of loss of identity after his passage through the army, if at no time Is the script concerned with showing us how the boy was in his previous life? If he no longer had an identity (at least for the viewer), how could he lose it?Jarhead is a work full of foreign references, from the poster that refers to M. A. S. H. (Robert Altman's film also lends Mendes a penchant for the theater of the absurd) to the emblematic screening of ""Apocalypse Now"" at the barracks cinema. Another influence, probably involuntary, is the Israeli ""Kippur (2000)"", one of the best war films of recent years. Filmmaker Amos Gitai's work treats the battlefield not as a stage for masterful tactics, explosions and well-aimed shooters, but as a burden where there is no heroism, just the liturgy of patrolling, advancing, retreating, collecting bodies. Jarhead is like that too, an endless routine of digging trenches against an unseen enemy. Incidentally, in the case of the ""video game war"", there is not even an opportunity for confrontation. Cleaning rifles and masturbating, says Swofford, are the two ways to stay sane when a desert stay lasts longer than weeks. It's not hard to predict, then, why the eclectic Englishman Mendes' war movie - which still comes across as too literal, too solemn, as in ""Road to Perdition"" - did not do well at the US box office at the time of its release. The audience wants blood, wants to hear the helicopters riding with the Valkyries! And there are no operas here, even though the director piles up the soundtrack with T. Rex, Nirvana, Tom Waits, Public Enemy...Visually, ""Jarhead"" is unforgettable, despite the lack of external combat, or mainly as a result of it. Photography is done by Roger Deakins, the favorite of the Cohen brothers. What he does is a work of art: a white image of the desert, where the sky, never blue, is a pale yellow and is very reminiscent of the look of Three Kings. Here the scenery seems even more inhospitable than a salt field, a place that is not at all welcoming or humane, impossible to adapt. The surreal environment goes to an extreme when the platoon digs next to oil wells set on fire by Iraqi troops. The screen is completely black, a contrast to everything else in the film. At this moment it really seems that, in the midst of the oil rain, those Marines are on another planet. And in a way they are.There are moments of camera in hand, the documentary feature often used in Saving Private Ryan, that brings us even closer to those men. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is impeccable. At every moment he fills the screen with emotion, splendidly humanizing that inhospitable environment. Even so, the film is essentially minimalist, with clear scenarios and without many details, falsely linear characters, all dressed in the same way, acting in the same way and thinking in the same way. And yet each one demonstrates a different feeling.It's strange the feeling you get out of the cinema after ""Jarhead"". You watch the boredom and waiting of the soldiers and you are sure that monotony, and even a certain security, will suddenly end in a great and noisy bath of blood and dust. And that moment almost comes, several times, but it never comes. The climax is never reached. The interesting thing is that after a while you find yourself with a morbid desire to see some killing, but it never happens. When the war is over, after nothing glorious has happened, we share a mix of frustration and relief with the characters. It's like sex, but without ever reaching orgasm.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Great Flick,"I saw this film last night and it totally blew me away. I went into the theater not really expecting much, mostly due to the critical backlash with which this film has endured. Unlike a lot of the critics I've heard, I thought the movie was absolutely brilliant. It's right up their with Platoon and Full Metal Jacket in my book. The acting in this movie is great. Jake Gyllenhall was extremely convincing as a marine corp. grunt. His emotionally powerful portrayal of a scared, broken, and frustrated young marine makes those of us who are not in the service understand some of the sacrifices these men make.

"Every War Is Different, Every War Is the Same","Excellently described, on the DVD sleeve: ""'Jarhead' (the self-imposed moniker of the Marines) follows Swoff (Jake Gyllenhaal) from a sobering stint in boot camp to active duty, where he sports a sniper rifle through Middle East deserts that provide no cover from the heat or Iraqi soldiers. Swoff and his fellow Marines sustain themselves with sardonic humanity and wicked comedy on blazing desert fields in a country they don't understand against an enemy they can't see for a cause they don't fully grasp.""Sam Mendes' ""Jarhead"" very effectively captures the Humor, Fear, and Waiting of War - in this case, George H. Bush's 1991 ""Desert Storm"" to retrieve Kuwait from Iraq. Certainly, it helped to have adapted the story from participating Marine Anthony Swofford, who was ""young and stupid"" enough to have ""got lost on his way to college,"" and volunteered. Of course, neither ""Swoff"" nor his brothers are really ""stupid"". The Marines may not possess knowledge about every subject under the desert sun, but they are human; and, they are treated with dignity and respect in this film.Mr. Gyllenhaal, Peter Sarsgaard (as Troy), Lucas Black (as Kruger), Brian Geraghty (as Fergus), Jacob Vargas (as Cortez), Laz Alonso (as Escobar), Evan Jones (as Fowler), and Iván Fenyö (as Pinko) are a terrific Unit. Jamie Foxx (as Sykes) is a perfect Lifer. Keep an eye on Mr. Sarsgaard ""Troy"" characterization, for a ""Best Supporting Actor"" caliber performance. Mr. Jones' ""Fowler"" is also letter-perfect. And, Roger Deakins' photography is spectacular.One mistake the film makes is NOT developing some characters fully. Mr. Geraghty's ""Fergus"" and Mr. Fenyö's ""Pinko"" absolutely need more minutes on screen, considering their roles; and, the direction is good enough to warrant a longer running time. A ""Director's Cut"", or reading of the book, is necessary.

"My first Jake Gylenhall movie since ""The Day After Tomorrow""","Wasn't super keen on seeing this, but wifey thought it was worth a look.The movie is an adaption of a novel written by Anthony Swofford,a soldier who served in Desert Storm. We follow Anthony's entry into the Marines and then his deployment to Iraq to be involved in Desert Storm, a mission to basically guard the Oilfields and watch for attackers.The movie shows us a bit of what life in the Marines is like, plus shows the great depth of emotions soldiers go through, from monotony to sheer horror. I was not overly impressed by the actual story, which seemed to be a bit shallow and, bar a few scenes, didn't go into great detail about the emotions and feelings of the characters. Maybe this was purely because of how the writer put his feelings to paper, but the director should have been able to portray this for him. There were a few powerful scenes, but I feel the actors, particularly Pete Sarsgaard and Jamie Foxx, were wasted. Maybe I was just confused, but I felt there was stuff there Swofford felt, but couldn't portray except done through visual, over the top scenes. Some may argue his feelings were sincere and honest and were portrayed in that manner and the director chose not to go down the usual Hollywood route of lots of unrealistic crying/great speech moments, but I'd argue then the movie should have been done in a totally different manner than as a ""Blockbuster"".",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A hundred million dollar trashing of the US military & servicemen,"This film ratchets up the trendy bashing of American cultural values and the military that assures our country's identity. The makers bludgeoned us with 2 hours of human depravity and futility without any redeeming value. In the same vein as American Beauty, the main character drifts through a moral-less quagmire of perverse thinking and destructive behavior. The beautiful shots and excellent acting are the only positive attributes. The story is devoid of character development and a sense of direction.

This is just a diss on the Marines. Who said boot camp was easy going for any branch of our military. The message is just not 100% true about our Marines. Overall, I believe that Jamie Foxx was and is the bomb and is very likable.

I much appreciate how there is minimal hand-holding in terms of plot and character progression, however some of the themes and messages can be a bit on the nose.Many of the scenes, dialogue, themes, and character archetypes seem heavily influenced by prior war films of the past.

pretty good anti-war movie,This is a movie based on the first gulf war in 91 but there are several movies that are better than this one like Three Kings and Courage Under Fire.

Jake Gyllenhaal stars a young marine who goes through basic training to become a sniper and is upset that the war is over so quick.

"A Must-See War Film, Thanks to Roger Deakins","Director Sam Mendes, the man responsible for modern classics American Beauty and Revolutionary Road, almost always seems to know what he's doing, be it heavy (Road to Perdition) or light (Away We Go). This is why his 2005 war film, Jarhead, is such a disappointment. The concept of the film is great and the cinematography is, at times, as beautiful as you'll see in a war film. But damn, some of the attempts to make the film seem  err  hip, are embarrassing. The incessant use of unfitting, of-its-time music - used as an attempt to keep the movie light and fun - is so blatant and annoying that you can't help but cringe. The playful moments amongst the Marines who make up the story of this film are borderline cheesy. Actually, they're not borderline anything - they're flat out cheese.This is a shame because, aside from the then-hip casting of lead man Jake Gyllenhaal (at the time a sudden cult figure thanks to Donnie Darko), the casting was great. The writing was great. The production was great. These few small mistakes keep Jarhead from being the best war film of the Naughts.The story of Jarhead is simple. Our hero, Anthony Swofford (Gyllenhaal in his first major studio lead role), joins the Marines just as Operation Desert Shield is about to hit. He spends a lot of time adjusting and questioning what he's doing, but even more time wondering what his girlfriend is doing back home. (We're made to feel like this girlfriend of his is his everything - amusing, considering the character is 20 years old.) At the urging of Seargent Sykes (Jamie Foxx), Swofford becomes a Marine sniper, which he is very good at. He's he part of an ace team of shooters, paired with the always excellent Peter Sarsgaard, as Cpl. Alan Troy.The crew of Marines, led in rank by Sykes and spirit by Troy, almost never appear scared. Aside from Skarsgaard, who leads the way as far as acting, Lucas Black (as Chris Kruger) stands out. He's a Texas boy who goes back and forth between airhead and the most reasonable man in his squad. At one point, when the Marines are discussing the point of the war, Kruger puts it straight: ""I know these oil guys; I've been around them all my life. They drink oil like water. This is a war about money; we're here to keep the oil cheap."" No one believes him. Later in the film, when the soldiers are told to sign a waiver and take an untested pill that can supposedly fight the side effects of nuclear weapons, Kruger again stands up, spitting the pill out after fighting with Sykes. These are some of the most memorable scenes, not only because of the subject matter, but because Black (who most know as the young, twangy boy in Sling Blade), is a heck of an actor.But don't get excited, this isn't an overly political film. There are points made here and there, but, mostly, the film attempts to show what it was like to be a Marine during Operation Desert Shield. The movie moves slow as we watch the Marines sit and wait. They foolishly hope for action as the days pass. There are side stories here and there (watching porn together, sneaking alcohol, accidentally burning up a tent full of explosives, etc.) that remind more of an American Pie movie than Apocalypse, Now.But that's okay, in a movie this slow, I'm guessing the producers and Mendes knew they'd need some cheap thrills. Personally, I'd rather have the film be shorter and less fluffy, but, when you cast Jake Gyllenhaal, you almost HAVE to bring the fluff. My personal favorite comedy bit, and maybe the only one that works in the entire film, happens when a helicopter flies over the Marines when they're at their lowest point. As the helicopter passes, blaring the Doors song ""Break On Through,"" Swofford looks at the sky and says ""that's Vietnam music; can't we get our own music?"" After about 80 minutes the film starts to pick up. Our crew of Marines are in the 112 degree desert, chasing a group of fire-happy Iraqi soldiers. The way cinematographer Roger Deakins (known mostly for his work on The Shawshank Redemption and every great Coen Brothers film) shoots the desert footage is amazing. I don't want to give anything away, but will say that, between Skarsgaard's powerful performance and Deakins' cinematography, Jarhead is a must-see. Sometimes it feels like a painfully by-the-books war film and at other times it stands alone - thanks to Deakins' amazing eye and mastery of his craft. (Towards the end we get to see some incredible footage of a desert filled with burning oil wells. It's the kind of cinematic imagery film fans dreamt of before all this crazy CGI stuff became so standard. I recall being wide-eyed and out of breath through many of these scenes.) Is there a big bang at the end? Does the suspense and conflict finally come as it does in, well, every war film ever? Well  maybe. Kinda. I don't quite know how to explain it. I will say this: upon it's initial release, the ending made the average movie-goer angry and many cinephile types happy. It's uncompromising and subtle, which is strange when you consider how much, at times, it felt likes Mendes was trying to make an artsy war film for the popcorn crowd. Instead, he ends up with a film that is only a few cheap mistakes away from being a classic.Jarhead is full of memorable lines, but is best summed up in the final minutes when Swofford says ""every war is different; every war is the same.""",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A different war movie (if it is).,"Jarhead is a good movie that you should see. Although it has the same structure of war movies (training, war, conclusions), it isn't a war movie: you won't see spectacular battles and bloody tracks. On the contrary: all the situations that in a war movie would be filmed with a furious action scene, in JH are depicted with a strong slow down of tension and rhythm, as they happened out of time.The thoughts of Swofford (the protagonist) -filled of a bitter and grotesque humor- are really fantastic and analyze what's happening from a fascinating point of view, that makes laugh also in dramatic moments.

Realistic and Insightful,"This film is based on a real account, written by a real US Marine; and it certainly seems to depict the Gulf War in a extremely believable way.

All of the cast from Jake Gyllenhaal's lead to Chris Cooper's 60 seconds of screen time, are brilliant, every character is real, every word that they speak is part of an overall statement and the cinematography is sublime.This movie is a truly gritty and insightful journey through the war, at no time does it try and falsify emotions or disguise the true images; yet it isn't what is generally considered to be a war film.

Jarhead,"Jarhead I'll be the bearer of bad news and say that ""Jarhead"" will most likely not make it to the Oscars at least in the Best Picture category. Even though I highly enjoyed the film I was a little disappointed in some aspects. With the exception of one really good scene Peter Sarsgaard, the two time snubbed for two years running, doesn't give a performance that would make the Academy think to give him a makeup nomination I was expecting him to be the standout of the film and felt a little disenchanted. Maybe a little more screen time would of sealed the deal for him but it didn't. He could make it if the Academy is feeling extra super bad for his snub which I think they aren't.Jamie Foxx is trying extra hard after his debacle of a win last year (I know, I know you're mouth probably dropped but I really felt he didn't deserve it.) to become a serious actor. He is very good in the film but there is nothing Oscar bait about the role. It sounds really good on paper but it just isn't impressive. I loved his character because he was amusing and made certain gestures that were utterly scene stealing but nothing is ""Oscary"" about it.The true problem with this film is very poor character development. I'm not sure if it's the book's fault by Anthony Swafford or the adaptation from William Broyles, Jr. but I found it very difficult to fall in love or hate any of the characters. They were all just a mere surface visual and nothing that transcribed into a full fledged character that you could take with you home . It could nab a screenplay nod if the Academy likes the film but again I highly doubt it.Standout from the film was the very surprising Jake Gyllenhaal who I felt did the best he could with what he had. Gyllenhaal gave a stunning portrayal of a soldier during Desert Storm just looking for a purpose. Swofford tells the story of the marines not himself which is probably the reason for the poor character development. And by marines I mean marines in general not his platoon. Gyllenhaal is having a fantastic year and still has the baity Brokeback Mountain coming in December. Look out for a surprise double nomination at the Globes. I'm expecting great things from him in the coming years.""Jarhead"" was a good experience but director Sam Mendes seems to be on a slow steady decline from his masterpiece ""American Beauty."" I see some technical categories coming up for ""Jarhead"" with a small possibility for Sarsgaard for a makeup nomination but other than that it just wasn't the Oscar story that needed to be told. It seems this year is not shaping too well as we all hoped.Grade **1/2/****",,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent war movie - without much war!,"I can take or leave war films, however, I have to say this one is pretty good, especially as it contains a real lack of any actual fighting.It centres on one man's - Anthony Swofford's - personal tale of life in the modern (well, early nineties) American army. He's not an officer, or in any particular position of authority - he's a grunt, a foot-soldier, or a 'Jarhead.' After Saddam Hussein first invades Kuwait, the US ship out their Jarheads to wait for the order to attack. This is the story of the wait.Therefore, we never see our Jarheads charging heroically over the top or anything similar. It's just about the wait. Now, that may not sound like the most exciting premise for a movie, but I think that's the point. Jarhead isn't really meant to be exciting. It's more of a drama about men from lower class America, who don't really have many career options and enlist as a way of making a living.I really enjoyed it. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a great performance as the put-upon Jarhead at the centre of the film and, overall, it's well worth a watch, even if you're not a fan of war movies in general.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
That old bat from Santa Fe,"Jamie Foxx seems to like the military movies. This, and the later ""The Kingdom"", focus on Jamie portraying himself as an American Soldier in hostilities in the Middle East. And this one is focused on Desert Storm back in 1991.Even though Foxx is in this, he isn't the main character. Jake Gyllenhaal's movie persona is what this is primarily about. Joining the Marines and going to Iraq. But it doesn't show a glamorous military, but some of the uglier sides. Mutiny, losing control, insubordination, drunkenness, frustration, and the like. Troops go through the ups and downs of being away from their woman, some of them losing their woman as they go off to fight.There were several times it was funny, especially in the first twenty minutes. Also, there are times it gets slow and melodramatic. After the short war that Desert Storm was, the men in this drama go home and we are shown how they turned out a few years later.Overall, its slightly above average. The drama sometimes was overblown. But also at times it was funny. Give it a go if you wish. ""C+""",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A ""good enough"" movie about military life","Anthony Swofford's highly literate 2003 memoir of his days in the Marine Corps, including service as a sniper in the first Gulf War (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm), gave this film its title and substance. ""Jarhead,"" as nearly everyone must know by now, is slang for a Marine grunt: it refers to the look of the requisite ""high and tight"" haircuts and also to an image of the new soldier as an empty receptacle for indoctrination. ""Jarhead"" is a good enough film, but is far from being a great one.Swofford's memoir was a decidedly interior book, a narrative about the impact of military training and the threat of war on the soldier's sense of identity, about the resulting intense emotions of self doubt, fear and rage, and the indelible killer instinct training presses upon the soldier. Swofford is interested in the combatants' inner life, their souls. His book is an existential essay on the soldierly experience. Since films are all about action and exteriority, not reflection and states of mind, the prospects for a decent adaptation of a book like Jarhead thus seem dim from the outset.I realize that it's tedious and trite to complain when a film adaptation of a novel or memoir differs substantially from the book. We're supposed to judge a film on its own merits, not by comparison to its source. But when a film adaptation does not quite hit the mark, sometimes the reason becomes more clear if you turn to the written source.Actually, because films are about action while books are typically about thought and feeling, few adaptations can be entirely faithful to their sources. Of course there are examples, the grand exceptions, where books are adapted well for the screen, but the whys and wherefores of these successes is a whole separate subject. Just to name two recent ones, though: think of Michael Ondaatje's ""The English Patient,"" adapted for the screen by Anthony Minghella, or Annie Proulx's ""The Shipping News,"" adapted by Lasse Hallstrom and Robert Nelson Jacobs.My reason for taking the risk of boring you to death here is to point out that this film's great flaw is precisely that so much is lost in translation from the page to the screen. Because existential reflection has to be jettisoned in favor of action for this film, the core of Swofford's powerful writing is lost and we end up with just another movie about military life.In the boot camp sequence up front we're reminded of Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket."" In the monotony of daily life in the service we pause to recall the drunken boredom of the soldiers in ""From Here to Eternity."" Gripped by the fear that accompanies waiting to encounter a faceless enemy, we think of Vietnam, of films like ""Platoon,"" or the Russian film ""Checkpoint,"" about the Chechnyan War. Sam Mendes even helps us conjure such reflections by having his grunts whoop it up watching ""Apocalypse Now.""But, like I said, it's a pretty good picture. We follow Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), his best buddy Alan Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) and a handful of their mates as they endure training, then a painfully long and idle deployment to Saudi Arabia, and, finally, brief and utterly surreal combat. We see a few scenes from a later time as well, back home, a gathering to mourn the loss of one of the guys. The acting all around is solid. Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard are especially good, as is the ensemble of their buddies, especially Evan James, Lucas Black and Jacob Vargas. Jamie Foxx evinces some serious swagger as the hard-edged Staff Sergeant Sykes, who leads the sniper contingent on the desert.Mendes, a young Brit who came from stage work to film, is smart: he hires top filmmakers to help him. In ""American Beauty"" he enlisted Conrad L. Hall, and his son, Conrad W., to photograph and Thomas Newman to write the music. For ""Jarhead,"" Mendes engaged Roger Deakins (""Shawshank Redemption,"" ""The Big Lebowski"") for his DP and Walter Murch as editor (Murch edited ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""The English Patient"" and the ""Godfather"" trilogy, among many others), and Mendes again used Newman and also Tom Waits to create the score.So, between the talented acting and the craftsmanship on display here, ""Jarhead"" is well worth your attention. If you want the existential part, read the book. My rating: 7.5/10 (low B+). (Seen on 11/13/05).

Silent but Deadly,"""Jarhead"" is an autobiographical account of a Marine sniper named Anthony Swofford, based on his 2003 book of the same name, about his service in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait during Desert Storm in the early 1990's. It is obviously a war movie, but not in the sense that it is filled with combat and carnage - indeed, the 2 1/2 hours of the film are almost totally void of any combat whatsoever. It is a firsthand account of a group of men that were vigorously and relentlessly trained and prepared - all so they could sit and wait for months. How do you keep your mind and body on edge and, as their sergeant says, ""suspiciously alert"" when nothing ever happens? And if your mind and body are always thinking of battle, ready for combat, how do you handle months of stillness? The film answers these questions in an honest and unsettling way. For 2 1/2 hours, we get a small taste of the seemingly endless days of nothing that these highly trained Marines experienced. Sound like the war movies you're used to?It was directed by Sam Mendes, whose 1999 film ""American Beauty"" won several Academy Awards,including Best Picture and Best Director for Mendes; Beauty is a gorgeous, darkly funny film about a 40-something nobody (played by Kevin Spacey) who experiences something of a personal renewal, which leads to a joyous, reckless lifestyle for the last year of his life, until he is murdered at the end of the film (If you think I have given something away, note the movie's opening line: ""I'm Lester Burnham. In less than a year, I'll be dead.""). He was also at the helm of 2002's ""Road to Perdition,"" the harrowing tale of a family man and his lingering mob connections, and their catastrophic results. I mention these previous works for two purposes: 1) to show that Mendes is a talented and capable filmmaker with a poignant visual style, and 2) to demonstrate that he is fit for tragedy, and apt to make films with dark reality as their center. ""Jarhead"" is nervously funny, and deals in a very subtle and poignant way with two dark and disturbing realities: the horror of war (a well-known, almost expected, theme for war movies) and the perhaps deeper horror of a wicked and mysterious tendency that lies in its participants.Am I being elusive here? Perhaps there's no good way to put into words the emotions the movie provokes. It is given validity not only by the fact that it is based on a firsthand account of the war, but by its strong performances. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the narrator character, Anthony Swofford, and it is easily his best work, and shows us that we may see many more great achievements from this young actor. Excellent supporting performances also come from Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgaard.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
lpov soldier,"I went to see this film expecting it is going to be awful.Because i read a bad review. surprisingly it wasn't. It was not that bad actually. people were complaining there are showing not enough war. Well it was just enough explosions and violence to see.it was from a realistic point of view what young American soldiers are really up to. Simple as that. And for the Jake fans, it us just a dribble competition!there is not a strong political message, but a hint of how pointless war is.War fans who love battle scenes and want to learn well planned strategies of how to kill a mass of living beings i suggest Lord of the Rings,Braveheart,Troy and probably Narnia.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
its not about fighting...its about NOT fighting,"First off. Don't go into this film expecting some hard boiled, guns blazing epic about heroics in the heat of combat. This isn't told from the point of view which fans of old WW2 maybe familiar with. So please don't say ""It didn't have any fighting in it"" after the movie ends, as thats the point of the film.The story follows in the steps of raw marine recruits, or Jarheads, primarily Anthony Sworford (Jake Gyllenthal) who are just starting their tour of duty in Iraq. Being in their late teens early 20's they are pumped up, full of testosterone, and ready for some action. But as the film progresses, it dawns on them they misunderstood what ""war"" actually is. Gone are the days of cavalry charges, battleground gunfights, valour. Man has been replaced by machine, war has become about technology, not about courage.Hoever, they are all in the same situation, young, inexperienced, far from home, and fighting against an enemy they can't see. Comradeship plays a key part in this move, as the marines realise all they have is each other, the marine next to them. They begin to form bonds that can never be broken, as they face the unpleasant pressures of war together.Sam Mendes does a terrific job in the directors chair, with Thomas Newman contributing to a brilliant score as always. The cinematography of the vast open landscapes, burning oil fields and sweltering hot deserts is spot on, and helps create the atmosphere for this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good Film....nothing new,"When i could look at the first trailer i thought this is the movie i missed for so long since full metal jacket. Well.....This movie can be looked at 2 ways. 1.The shots are a fine piece of work , the actors really did a great job on playing the effects of war , special effects are fine as well ,realistic etc.... Based on this i could easily give it a 8 or even 9 of 10.But , there is option nr2.There is absolutely nothing new in this film that we haven't seen in full metal jacket.As a matter of fact it is a almost identical copy , just the story,characters are different.The main ""message"" of this film should be to show people the effects of war on people.But it is perfectly the same ""way of change"" of personalty that we could see in FMJ on the soldiers.So the only logical explanation to this film is quite simple.In the current political ,eonomical situation of the world , there is a big need for films , to show people :War is bad ! But this message has to be brought by a story that is more ""up to date"".And the memory of the Gulf War is more alive than it is Vietnam. So the perfect movie is born.Good looks , good actors , nothing new.If you haven't seen FMJ , have a look on that first. If you want to see a movie , but just a movie , this one is for you.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kudos Hollywood,"I must give Hollywood some credit here, they did not bow to the liberals in that town and make an anti-war, anti-George Bush movie. Based on the New York Times review of ""Jarhead"", liberals are upset because this movie could've been used by them as an anti-war picture. The NY Times thought this movie ""said nothing"". Translation: it was not anti-war or anti-conservatives. At the same time, this movie is not pro-war or pro-conservative. It simply tells the story of what it was like for those on the ground in the desert. I enjoyed this movie a lot and I hope it does well. Anthony Swafford is an excellent writer and I would highly suggest you reading his book. Swafford tells his story well, and the movie captures that perfectly.",,Anonymous,Biography
Gulf War Frustrations Vividly Captured Even Though Characters Remain Distant,"Some films work more effectively on a visceral level than a logical one, and this 2005 film adaptation of U.S. Marine Anthony Swofford's 2003 biting memoir is one of them. Chronicling the author's time from boot camp through the brief 1991 Gulf War, director Sam Mendes fills his sometimes blackly comic film with brutalizing images that give it a consistently propulsive urgency. Written by William Broyles Jr. (who had wartime duty in Vietnam as a pilot), it is not really a combat film as the focus of the story is the incessant waiting that the ground troops endured before realizing the conflict was over almost as soon as it began. Mendes and Broyles have us look at the preparation for the ground war within an episodic structure that keeps everything at arm's length emotionally. Moreover, they borrow liberally from previous military-themed films  not only obvious references to scenes from Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" and Brian DePalma's ""Casualties of War"" but also paeans to the group dynamics in WWII-era movies with each of the Marines representing familiar wartime archetypes.Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the fresh-faced Swofford and does an admirable job here as he outwardly expresses his enthusiasm, especially when he gets chosen to be a surveillance sniper, but inwardly has gnawing misgivings about his tour of duty. His becalmed voice-over is what ties the loose connective tissue of the story, as well as the constant punishment Swofford receives from his superiors, including a humiliating demotion from lance corporal to private for covering an act of false bravado by a fellow recruit. Peter Sarsgaard plays Swofford's scouting partner Troy in his trademark elliptical manner given that his character's motivations remain suspect until revelations come to light toward the end. Due to the nature of the film, other characters are not as fully realized, including Jamie Foxx doing commendable work in a relatively small role as the unyielding Staff Sgt. Sykes (his one personal scene when he discusses his life at home seems shoehorned in), Dennis Haysbert in a couple of scenes as the arrogant Major Lincoln, Chris Cooper effectively Schwartzkopf-like as Lt Colonel Kazinski, and the young actors portraying Swofford's fellow recruits. It took me a while to recognize Lucas Black, who plays the horny redneck Kruger, as the young boy in Billy Bob Thornton's ""Sling Blade"".Performances aside, the standout work is Roger Deakins' cinematography, which captures the surreal atmosphere of the deserts with the mirage-inducing heat during the day and the burning oil wells at night. There are few scenes more painfully evocative of the war than the one where the Marines come upon the charred remains of locals frozen as if caught in an A-bomb attack. The overall realism of the movie is what makes this noteworthy, and to the filmmakers' credit, it has no political agenda beyond showing the agonies of serving in prospect of a war. The soundtrack has period-appropriate music that runs the gamut from Nirvana to Naughty by Nature to C+C Music Factory. The obvious comparison the film engenders is with David O. Russell's 1999 ""Three Kings"", which shares the same setting and a similar orientation toward black comedy, though I have to say that Russell's film is more inventive. Still, Mendes is an individualistic director whose work is always worth experiencing.The DVD has several solid extras, including two separate commentary tracks. Interestingly, the one with Swofford and Broyles, both familiar with military service firsthand, is more informative than the one provided by Mendes, who focuses more on the themes and his inspirations. There are a handful of deleted scenes which were understandably excised, including one with Sam Rockwell playing Swofford's gung-ho military uncle talking to the camera (actually to Swofford in a flashback), a seeming rip-off of a Christopher Walken's scene in ""Pulp Fiction"". There is another set of scenes under the umbrella of Swofford's fantasies, also deleted, but intriguing for the black comedy aspect that they seemed to serve. Also included is a longer version of the interview sequence where the media volleys questions to the recruits in documentary style. Veteran film editor Walter Murch adds his commentary to Mendes' on all the deleted scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not entirely my thing...,"I was not as impressed as the critics by this totally-politically-correct movie. Not all wars are meaningless, not all people in this modern world of ours are without a sense of what is good, what is right and worth fighting for. Furthermore, I refuse to buy in to the overt simplification and to believe that all US Marines are basically retarded morons.I have read the book, and even though it is not one of my favorites, it is very much different from the film, as books usually are. To me, this was not much more than an average film, one that leaves many problems untouched, many questions unanswered.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The classic that never was,"Although I think the finer points have been hit on, I wanted to add my two cents about what is bound to be an over looked classic. Perhaps I should start then by stating why exactly this movie is going to miss the mark, so to speak, while at the same time hitting it so precisely. In the end there are few things which do not boil down to politics, and while competitive democracy has its high points it creates a sort of vacuum of polarization with no in between. This is important because in a world where there is no middle road, we cannot take seriously something un-polarizing and un-opinionated. It's unfortunate but true and it's exactly why some people are going to be unable to enjoy this movie (a lot of people). In fact if you've ever held a protesters sign, regardless of the cause, there is a fairly high chance you will find the lack of moral direction here offensive.The movie quite literally does the impossible; it portrays war without attempting to lead the viewer to moral conclusions. In fact it is not so simple as to ignore these moral conclusions; you will find characters expressing them from both sides of the moral spectrum. In each case attempts by characters to frame the issue in a certain way simply fall flat in the face of reality. Over optimism finds itself faced with sad truth while true pessimism is never realized. And if the last sentence sounds like it should be impossible, then that is yet further truth of just how good (and different) this movie is.The objective of this film is to tell a story about people and the effects war has on them. It is funny, sad, disappointing, anticlimactic, beautiful, intense and frustrating especially if you were a character in it. I am not an easy judge of movies (quite harsh actually) but I do enjoy things which attempt a topic from a new angle. Perhaps the fact this is the first war movie which has no angle provides a sad insight into both why it is so good and why it will be so under-appreciated.~Ryan",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
could've been better,"I was both exhilarated and disappointed with this flic. Having had our surfeit of Vietnam War movies (one of which becomes a scene focus early in this film), it's nice to see the anti-war genre continue to promote the message using more recent conflicts. Photography is excellent; composition of scenes is vibrant; soundtrack is an integral part of the movie...vintage stuff that comments on the accompanied scene.Gyllenhaal is a good actor but there are times when he slips out of character...when it seems to be him and not Swoff(ord); too much reliance on the eye shots (the 'windows-to-the soul' dramatic close-up) and too little attention to encompassing body language and gesture. Desert scenes are contrived but evocative. Does not attempt to be a realistic portrayal of Desert Storm or any other recent conflict but rather to be a gritty portrayal of 'normal' young men thrust into situations that no 'normal' civilized person should have to face.It's partially successful in a comfortable, sanitized way. Tries to be realistic in exploitative ways which is a real pity because the message that is espoused doesn't need any phony emphasis.Chris",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A truly terrifying experience,"America will never be defeated in a battle (any time soon) but will it ever win the hearts and minds of the people they are supposedly liberating as they did during WWII? After WWII many wars have been fought but all have been lost in the eye of the general public. This motion picture is scary for anyone outside of the US. Especially those who think of the USA as the good guys, the A-Team for the world, the country that promotes truth and justice and stands for honesty and civil liberties for anyone. This motion picture is a wake up call for all those who think that American soldiers are there to protect the innocent, to fight for a good cause, democracy. American soldiers are no longer fighting for truth and justice, they fight for commercial reasons, special interest groups in Washington define the targets. Soldiers have no moral problems in this movie to pull the trigger, they want to kill, they were trained to kill and therefore they are going to kill. Anyone. Anywhere. Anytime.This is in essence a portrayal of the downfall of American moral. Any legitimacy for fighting abroad has disappeared and Jarhead is the Full Metal Jacket of a nihilistic generation. A truly terrifying movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Masterful Showing of The Hidden Parts of War,"The insane psychological insight on soldiers of war is impressive. Absolutely amazing story telling of hidden horrors of war with depressingly true to real live elements. Amazing acting from Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx. It is just lacking engagement. It is very easy to lose interest during the gruesomely slow pacing. The film takes a toll on your perception of war and its effects on veterans. The early and middle of the film drags but does well at showcasing how every man's war is different, in length and intensity. All said it is one of the most insightful and interesting war movies I've ever seen and a very good one at that.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"No, not good","Maybe it's a European thing, but the movie has got way too much credits. It doesn't pay off. It's plain, simple and even gets boring at the end. Gyllenhaal does his acting job good, real good, but it's the story that breaks up the movie. What's the story again? Afraid of losing a girlfriend and not killing any enemies? Going berserk because sand is eating his brain?No, sorry, this is not how such a movie should have been directed. And if you want to make a movie of this, you should be less focused on Gyllenhaal, but put 'the others' in front instead. For xxx day's we see no difference until he snaps. Oh dear, the boy snaps. But in the end, the one he snaps to, gives him no problem at all. It's to simple.Sorry, I've seen far better (war)movies compared to this.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Full Metal Jacket Kuwait,"Though the latest effort from Sam Mendes, whose first two films I tremendously admire, seem to borrow a bit too much from Stanley Kubrick's films- (not just ""Full Metal Jacket"") and the film loses much of its momentum in the third act, it is a good war film. One of Mendes' main strenghts is attention for detail. I had first watched the first part of ""Jarhead"" a week ago, but something came up. I re-watched it in its entirety, and I noticed several interesting tidbits, such as Jamie Foxx's character reading the bible while on the TWA flight, and the lighting during the flashback sequence, that made me appreciate Mendes' knack for symbolism and detail. The film is in many ways about the Iraqi war of today as much as Desert Storm, and it makes little effort to seclude that. While I fully agree with the politics of the film, I think it is technically well-done enough to receive admirers from those who do not share the left-of-center sentiment that Mendes is expressing. As someone who appreciates Westerns, I loved many parallels that this film has with films like ""The Searchers,"" including a magnificent shot of two soldiers in the desert with the sun in the background. The cast is fairly good. I think Jamie Foxx is the one who is most in character at all times, but there are no weak performances at all. The film has many overt references to other war films, including ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Apocalypse Now!"" but in addition to 'Jacket' there are some similarities with films like ""Platoon"" and ""Coming Home."" I suppose if the line in the film that says 'No two wars are different. No two wars are the same"" is accurate then one could add ""No two war movies are different. No two war movies are the same,"" as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Crude, Rude and Real","How do men behave when completely isolated from women. The U.S. Marine Corps is one of those places which displays this perfectly. I saw a mother who had brought her 10 year old son to this movie. I wonder what his thoughts were upon leaving. At the very best it must have complicated what his views on life are. This movie did portray the atmosphere of a Marine on duty...boring, uncomfortable and not at all where you want to be. The only way to keep discipline is to continually call on one's manhood. Thus, women become an objective of purpose, not partners in life.Being a Marine changes your life...being a Marine in war changes who you are.With some creativeness from Hollywood, which stretches the reality to ram home these points, this movie addresses what military and war do to a person like you.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""There's a story...""","There were moments in ""Jarhead"" where I said: ""What a great movie"". I said the same thing during moments of ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to perdition"" but, as a whole, all of Sam Mendes' pictures are not great. They are three works of excellent cinematography and performances, that's for sure; but there's always something missing. I don't know how to explain it exactly; maybe it's like ""Munich""That it looks too perfect to be perfect.But I believe that in Mendes' films there's an emotion problem. So many characters in all of his works, so many moving moments, but no emotion passed on to the one who's watching the film. Nothing the viewer can feel (or at least I can't), just an amount of coldness in a very beautiful world, just good-looking characters that go through very bad thing that normally you wouldn't expect them to experience.""Jarhead"" the word, as Anthony Swofford explains in a typical Mendes' piece narration, is a name people use to talk of a Marine. ""Jarhead"" the film is, apparently, Swofford's (a Marine) true-life experiences in the war in Kuwait. In a precisely adapted script by William Broyles Jr. that involves more and more narration, this Marine goes back on his life and tells us there are things he can show us and think he can.Played by Jake Gyllenhaal in his best portrayal, Swofford reveals his persona through his talking, and instantly appears as a sardonic and unpredictable guy, usually positive and disinterested. ""We'll be back before you can get those nuts out of your system"", he tells another soldier on the plane going to the desert; they stayed there for a long time.In war Swofford meets the soldier friends: some 'latinos', a cowboy (Lucas Black), some outcasts, some sentimentalists and Troy, an unsettling man played naturally by Peter Sarsgaard. They all discuss about the girls they left home and about the family they want to haveSwofford also meets Sergeant Sykes who, for our fortune, is not the typical life- changing that usually appears in these films and that will change the life of the soldiers; and he's played by an ineffable Jamie Foxx.The days come and go as Swofford describes every activity carried out in the camp, and then as it must be, soldiers fight. You know what always happens in war movies, well ""Jarhead"" stands in the middle; without too many action sequences and without too much character and relationship development. The cinematography however, as I said, is superb. There's one moment of complete silence and contemplation where after staring at a disturbing view, Gyllenhaal walks in the desertHis footprints on the sand and the sight of him are pure photographic poetry; and I said ""what a great movie"".The reason why this is Gyllenhaal's best performance is because he gives ""Jarhead"" what it lacks the most: emotion. He tries so hard in bringing a little bit of true feeling to a plate that doesn't contain it; and he succeeds. And so did Kevin Spacey in ""American Beauty"", and Tom Hanks in ""Road to perdition""; and they succeeded too. It's contradictory that Mendes has directed these actors in this way and hasn't been able to give the same direction to his movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
All wars are different. All war movies are the same,"Jarhead follows the dramatic experiences of a US marine (and his unit) during the first gulf war. The movie makes an effort to stay away from the justifications for the war, focusing rather on the effects it had on the marines involved.If you enjoyed Tigerland, Platoon and Saving Private Ryan, this movie should high on your ratings list...until you watch it.The film will does not make a deep impact. The experiences of the marines are shown as dramatic, but not traumatic. The casualty scenes are graphic but not shocking. The scenery should be captivating but it looks fake and digitally enhanced. As a result, it has a clinical, almost distant, feel to it. It feels like you are watching a story rather than being able to relate to any of the characters.In a genre that demands powerful and thought-provoking film-making, this film is not even a shadow of Platoon or Apocalypse now. It lacks the ground-breaking style and sheer impact of either.The lead actors, although talented and charismatic, don't have the screen presence nor power of delivery needed to transform the story into a memorable film. That said, Jamie Foxx turns in a wonderful performance and steals the show as the platoon leader. But he's definitely no Robert Duvall or Martin Sheen.This is an interesting movie, with some touching scenes and fantastic dialogue. Ultimately it lacks depth and impact. Consequently it becomes just another movie in an over-exploited genre that hasn't seen anything ground-breaking in years.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Powerful war movie,"The movie takes place during the first Gulf war and contains some very graphic battle scenes. It is told from the viewpoint of one of the soldiers played by Jake Gyllenhaal.A very strong performance from Gyllenhaal. He plays Swofford the author of the book on which the movie is based. He questions his being in the war in the first place and never really comes to terms with it. Jamie Foxx, as Sgt. Sykes gives a powerful performance which could get him a supporting actor nomination at the Oscars.Sam Mendes gets the best out of a somewhat weak screenplay but this movie isn't in the same league as 'Road to Perdition' and 'American beauty'. I expected more action and think the movie would have been better for it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"OK...I saw it...and I was there, too.","After telling my wife that I wouldn't see it, I went ahead and did.I'll keep this short. I thought Swofford's book was better than the movie. His book's depiction of the War and the Marine's life during the wait was brilliant and right on the money. The movie? Not quite, but still had pretty good cinematography...the scenes of the battalion moving were realistic. The dramatic stuff? Maybe a little ""over-the-top."" Some of the stuff in Boot Camp, as well as the celebration after the War ended, didn't happen like I saw it, but maybe Swofford didn't have a say in that. Who knows. I don't where they shot this movie, but the sets looked just like Saudi (especially Dhahran and Jubail).It was worth watching, though, and I commend Swofford on his efforts in breaking the negative stereotype of Marines. I mean...he published a book. Pretty cool. His book got made into a movie. Even cooler. I've read reviews on here that are only written to hammer Swofford on what he ""did"" or ""didn't"" do. I can't stand former Marines who crucify other Marines, no matter what went down. Unforgivable in my book. Talk about the show and vent your anger elsewhere.Bottom line? It was a good movie and anyone who saw it should buy the book and give it a read. You'll like it, especially if you're a former Marine.Until then, see the movie. However, I wouldn't spend the extra quarter for the large drink instead of the medium, but that's just me...later.0251",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Glossy Fluff,"Production values are A+ but the movie isn't about anything. It vaguely dips into a host of issues and subjects but never fully develops any of them or gets around to making a point -- oh yeah, and it has a killer soundtrack.

I heard a rumor that ""American Beauty"" was radically different when shot (a courtroom drama, in fact) and was shaped in its current form in the editing room.

More stories about the Persian Gulf,"(2005) Jarhead
WARI agree with some of the reviewers that this film would seem quite long, but they're a lot of misconceptions about the Persian Gulf war! In this case it's this infantile group, which joined the Marines because they assumed they'd get a piece of the action, and after the film was over it kind of seems that this film may deter people from joining the army altogether- especially to be a trained sniper. Aside from joining as a marine sniper would also result in a lot of negative happenings affecting much family and friends upon coming at home. This is a negative point of view of people fighting on the front lines and does seem a little too far-fetch since they're a lot of men killed in action but is based on one man's real life experiences taken from a book written by Anthony Swafford's best selling book about his pessimistic experiences, but I highly doubt that all his experiences joining the marines are all this negative for the rest of the way and on other wars.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
average movie about the war life of a US Marine Sniper with better camera work,"The movie about a man who joins the US Marine Corps and ""becomes"" assigned to be a scout / sniper joins the Gulf.My main comment on this movie is that the story was rather empty. Low character development and no true depth. In contrast i would recommend Full Metal Jacket. Some scenes used in Jarhead even come directly from of this movie! If you want to see a movie about the war-life of the American soldier that movie is way better (not considering i know what that life is of course).A plus on off the movie was the way it was shot and the excellent settings! beautifully done. Anyways, an average movie that you do not need to see, but is a nice way to use up some of your otherwise useless time.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Polished,"Jarhead is not a masterpiece, but indeed a nice watch. Strong visuals, and a story that's slow (this is what the movie is about) but compelling enough.

Let me say, this movie is still way better than the most successful american, later movies about war by Kathryn Bigelow.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Compelling Character Study,"First there was American Beauty, a touching comedic drama about suburban family life. Then there was Road To Perdition, a masterful Prohibition-era gangster film. And now there's Jarhead, a unique Gulf War film. I think, with his first three films, director Sam Mendes has proved not only that he is obviously one of the most versatile filmmakers around, but also one of the most talented.Jarhead is the true story of Swofford (Gyllenhaal), a US Marine who endures the hell of boot camp on the boredom of Operation Desert Storm.Jarhead takes a very unique and original approach to the war genre. In a sense, it conveys the standard ""war is hell"" message, but not in the same blood-spattered manner that the likes of Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down did. Instead, the Marines of Jarhead are in hell in the sense that they're bored and lonely. Swofford is afraid, but not for his life, but for what his girlfriend may be doing in his absence. These young men are raging piles of testosterone with no release. Boot camp pumped up their blood-lust to an inhuman degree, and when there are no enemies to kill, all that's left for them to do is screw around and masturbate. Masturbate a lot.Jarhead strikes me as one of the most realistic depictions of modern war ever printed on celluloid. I don't understand how so many people could be claiming that the film is so inaccurate - after all, the book it is based on was written by a Marine. There is no over-the-top action combat a la Behind Enemy Lines, nor is there constant realistic battle like in Saving Private Ryan - after all, modern warfare is not exactly going to be like World War II. There is actually hardly a single bullet fired throughout the entirety of Jarhead's running time, which is going to be the main factor in causing multitudes of people to be terribly bored with the film. Let's get one thing straight: this is NOT a film about combat. This is a compelling character study dealing with the effects of military training on the human soul.Another misconception people seem to be having is that Jarhead has a strong leftist political agenda. While it is certainly not a pro-war film, I wouldn't necessarily say it is anti-war, either. It really just shows war as it is, like Full Metal Jacket. And keep in mind, this is only through the eyes of one Marine.Though it features no actual combat, Jarhead still contains some extremely affecting scenes, and one that is actually very hard to watch, that being a scene in which a Marine sits down to watch a VHS copy of The Deer Hunter that his wife sent to him, only to find that she has spliced in footage of her having sex with another man. Watching the husband's reaction is a very difficult task. I found myself so deeply affected by this scene that I actually felt a little sick and had a hard time moving on as the film kept rolling.However, Jarhead is certainly not an unrelenting downer. There is a great deal of scathing humor, almost to the point of making the film a very dark comedy.Mendes really does show off some remarkable talent here, as he did in his two previous films. And the acting...wow, it's phenomenal. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers his most impressive performance to date, as does Peter Sarsgaard. Chris Cooper is great as always, though underused, and Jamie Foxx gives a wonderful, nuanced performance, and that's saying a lot, as up until this film I found him to be one of the most overrated actors in recent memory. The rest of the supporting cast is excellent, as well.Though I did not find the score to be particularly good, the soundtrack here is magnificent. On top of PERFECTLY utilizing Nirvana's highly underrated gem ""Something In The Way"", Jarhead also features Tom Waits' ""Soldier's Things"", an instrumental version of Kanye West's ""Jesus Walks"", and many others.If you're looking for an action-packed war film, don't go to Jarhead. However, if you're looking for a stunningly different portrait of human beings in the military, this one's for you.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A good telling of an interesting story,"I must admit I was not expecting much from this movie, not knowing anything about Tony Swofford. I started watching it as a ""nothing else to watch"" time filler. However, I soon found myself being drawn into the movie.I feel that war movies, with a few exceptions, tend to descend into a blinkered view of the subject matter. But Tony has managed to tell a story from the view of the ordinary soldier without going gung ho or commenting on the validity of why they were there. In some way I was disappointed that the film was not longer. Although, at times, it was a bit tedious, there are some thing I would like to have seen explored a bit more.I also feel that the fact this was a grunts story, told from his perspective rather than as part of a larger ""plot"", gave it a nicer feel than some Hollywood script.But this is a movie I would definitely recommend to others.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""I love this job. I thank God for every day he gives me in the Corps. Oorah. "" - Sgt. Sieks","There are a lot of films I'm really looking forward to this year and those that I was looking forward to. For me, 'Jarhead' was definitely one of the most anticipated movies of 2005 for me, but it ended up being not like I expected. I expected it to be a modern-day war masterpiece that rivaled 'Platoon'. 'Jarhead' let me down in those respects, because it ended up being more of an emotional drama/dark comedy then a war film. 'Jarhead' isn't a masterpiece, but it is one hell of a great movie that is wholly original, haunting and thought provoking.There is next to none action/gore in 'Jarhead'. That's right, it's not a 'bang-bang' war film, but more like 'The Deer Hunter' in that it has to do entirely with the psyche of the soldiers/humans involved. 'Jarhead' follows the true story of Anthony Swofford, a Lance Corporal in Desert Storm who didn't really have a good war experience. Swofford (played by Jake Gyllenhaal  Donnie Darko, Wonder Boys) is kind of a shifty, morally confused, arrogant kid who joined up with the Marines and didn't get as much out of it as he expected. He mopes around and regrets his being there (which gets kind of annoying, but I could certainly see why he and everyone else was so terrified). While defending his good old country in Iraq, Swofford manages to befriend a seemingly All-American bravado Corporal, Alan Troy (Peter Sarsgaard  Kinsey, Garden State). The story follows them through training camp under the command of the Bible-thumping hard-ass staff Sergeant Siek (Academy Award Winner Jamie Foxx  Ray, Collateral) and then after follows them throughout their course in the desert, or in the ""suck"" as Cpl. Troy likes to call it.'Jarhead' has been described as a 'Platoon' or 'Apocalypse Now' for Generation X, and I have to say I don't really agree with it. Although 'Jarhead' takes place during a war, it's not really a ""war"" film per-say but an emotional roller-coaster of a drama. The incredibly talented Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) does a great job directing this, but I have to say it is definitely his weakest effort. 'Jarhead' is a great film, but it doesn't share the sheer brilliance 'American Beauty' and 'Road to Perdition' oozed. The screenplay is full of solid, believable and entertaining dialogue, but it really seems to drag during the non-talking periods. 'Jarhead' runs only 115 minutes but feels more like 2 ½ hours  2 ¾ hours. One of the highest points of 'Jarhead' besides the directing and dialogue is the acting. I never really found Jake Gyllenhaal to be that great but after seeing his remarkable and powerful performance in 'Jarhead' I gained a whole new respect for him as a performer. Jamie Foxx is always a blast to see although he really didn't have as meaty of a part as one would expect. The real prize actor of 'Jarhead' was Peter Sarsgaard. Sarsgaard gives an undeniably marvelous performance that will win him his very first Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination if there is any justice in the world. Dennis Haysbert, Lucas Black, Jacob Vargas and Chris Cooper (in a small but powerful role) also star.There has been controversy over this film saying it's liberal propaganda. I'm personally a Republican myself, and I didn't find too much offensive. Swofford is anti-war but that is just his character. I'm not anti-war, but I think it's terrible. 'Jarhead' doesn't necessarily say war is wrong but it does say that it is a terrible terrible thing (which anyone should think.) War is damn dirty business, but sometimes (in my opinion) it's the only solution. Even if you think war is a necessary evil, there is no way to deny the f*cked-up sh*t it does to some people. In the powerful final words of the film Swofford's character explains that everyone who has ever been a marine in war will be one for life, because something that traumatic ALWAYS stays with you. That is very true, but it has also been said many times before.I recommend 'Jarhead' if you want to see top-notch directing, acting and dialogue (if you don't mind the f-word being spewed every 3 seconds), and don't mind the serious lack of action/explosions/gore/shooting. It's a drama not a war picture, although it does take place in a war. It drags, but the good points far then out-weigh the bad points.

Bad Movie..don't waste your money,"This movie is terrible so do not waste your money. The trailers were the best part of the movie. However, it was like false advertising. What you see is not what you get. My take on this movie is someone wants you to hate the military. If you join the military your girlfriend will be cheating on you when you serve you country. This is definitely a liberal agenda! Hate the country and hate the military. Leaving the movie I heard lots of bad comments on the movie. I was looking for a hero and a good light on our defenders of freedom. Disappointment is what you will feel if you are an unfortunate one to see this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jarhead is not recommended,"I have two sons interested in the military. We saw it together last night. If this movie is typical of how the US trains its soldiers....heaven help us. The discipline was severely lacking. How could a soldier attack a superior officer without severe consequences?I was also disgusted by the porn offered. The visual is difficult to get out of your mind once you've seen it on the big screen. The frequent references to masturbation and homosexual sex was totally disgusting. It did not add to the story line.Do not take even mature teenagers to see this. It made my sons believe ""they are all like that""..It is also guilty of ""bait and switch"". The cute actor popping bubblegum was a screensaver on our computer for a couple of days. There was nothing cute about this movie. My eldest daughter thinks it was a dark comedy. I think it lacked character development and thus can not be classified as a ""type of movie"".",,Anonymous,Biography
Where's the action?,"Short Review:A documentary pretending to be a war movie. No action, no plot, and no moral questions. Although it offers a funny and satirical look at life in the Marines - it is for Sam Mendes/Jake Gyllenhaal fans only.Long Review:""Jarhead"" is a war movie. At least that's how the posters and previews would have you believe. However it is as much a war movie as a porno without sex is a porno. Unlike 99.9% of the other war movies out there is almost no action. It is not ""Full Metal Jacket"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"", you won't be mesmerized by the realistic fighting scenes. The film also lacks a plot. There are no conflicts to be resolved. No climax. When the film ends, it does so abruptly.The film is more of a documentary than a war movie. It offers insight into life in the USMC. This is where the film excels. Jake Gyllenhaal as Swoff manages to bring humor into the mind-numbing existence that they lived. Jamie Foxx (Staff Sgt. Sykes) and Peter Sarsgaard (Troy) also give excellent performances. ""Jarhead"" is educational - if not exceptional.Without a doubt the best part of this movie is its soundtrack! It certainly helps the movie a lot. The cinematography is also very haunting. Many scenes like the highway of death leading out of Kuwait and burning oil wells are recreated to stunning effect.All in all the film is worth seeing. It is not of the same caliber as Sam Mendes' last two movies: ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"". There are still, however, memorable scenes which no other movies offers.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jarhead,"After looking on IMDb to see if this was worth a watch i went to watch it. I found it made me think as i walked out of the cinema. Though in places it dragged i realised that this was the one of the points it was trying to put across. Many of my friends go to watch for entertainment but this isn't that sort of film. Naturally funny in many places, this film isn't the normal war film or a big blockbuster. Mendes directs, (esp. a brilliant performance by Foxx) with a varied degree of success. In many places he gets the story(thin in places) across with minimum of effort you realise your watching a film which doesn't have a direct plot line that you can tell your friends about. Its a odd film which got me hooked but i don't no quite why. Hope this kinda helps, first review and all!",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very enjoyable,"I enjoyed that very much the acting all round was really good, but Jake gyllenhaal was the clear standout performance.

Forget What You've Read,"Forget all of the negative hyperbole you may have read in so many other reviews of Jarhead, the third film from natural-born filmmaker Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition). His latest feature may not end up being the Oscar-bait many were expecting, but it's a remarkable take on modern warfare nonetheless.As with any genre film, viewers automatically compare a new entry to the films that came before it. Jarhead's opening barracks scene is eerily and unfortunately reminiscent of R. Lee Ermey's classic sequence in Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. This film occasionally wears its influences on its sleeve, but it's usually in service of the greater story being told. As one character bemoans late in the film, upon hearing The Doors blasting from a stereo, ""This is Vietnam music! Can't we get our own music?"" These feelings are at the heart of this atypical look at an atypical war.Jake Gyllenhaal gives an outstanding performance as real-life enlistee Anthony Swofford, whose book provided the basis for the film. While his training hardships aren't exactly ignored, his story focuses more on the dismay and resentment of troops who wound up in Iraq in 1991 only to wait, wait, and wait some more. What happens to a man who is trained to kill and then never gets to fire his weapon? This question and other overlooked realities of our presence in Iraq are handled intelligently in this gorgeous, well-acted, unjustly maligned picture.Rating: B+",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A strange one,"I don't think its a very good film. I think my main problem was that outside of the oil fires, there wasn't anything visually to keep me interested. Conrad Hall was a real genius and because of him Sam Mendes' other two films look incredibly beautiful. This just looks like every other war film from the last ten years 'war is really bad so we should make it look grim by messing around with the colour'. I hate to be that simplistic about it but that's the impression i got. I suppose also in my opinion there are problems with the script which is really good when taken in its component parts but seem to add up to very little.On the plus side, the acting is excellent all the way through, particularly Peter Sarsgaard, and like i said there are really good parts in the story and neat lines of dialogue.Definitely not the worst film i've seen lately but failed to make a lasting impression on me.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Perfect War Film, without all the Bullsh*t","This movie was f**kin awesome! I could not have imagined a war movie to be so perfect that no matter where you stand politically, you totally believe in the film. Jarhead goes there! The story is so beautifully told and the message is gotten without all the politics. It's kinda sad that it took a British man to do such a thing, but major props for Mendes for doing something that no American could! I'm republican, and I really felt like I was going to come out of the theater with some anger, but I truly didn't, and I am awed by that. Gyllenhaal deserves four Oscars and Sarsgaard ten. The pair together are brilliant on screen, and knowing that they are so close outside of Hollywood makes the relationship just that much more real. Jamie Foxx wisely chose a small, yet important role, emphasizing his star power even more. Go see it, talk to everyone you know about it. It's exhilarating.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Beautifully moving, personal film...","I've never been in the United States military. Sure, I've seen my fair share of war films, but I don't pretend to know what it's like for soldiers out there on the front lines, fighting a war, going through that intense training. With films like Jarhead, I'm still not going to get there, but I can at least watch an intense, dramatic representation that has to be as close to the truth as I can possibly figure.Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Anthony Swofford, a U.S. Marine who went through the Gulf War. We follow Swofford from boot camp early in the film (though briefly), to his post at Camp Pendleton, to the desert sands of Iraq and back again. First thing I'll say about him, is LORD did he beef up for this role. He looks the part about as well as I can judge. Throughout the film we follow Swofford closely, watching his relationships with his fellow Marines, with his commanding officers, and with his back-home girlfriend. Through it all Gyllenhaal is up to the task, and he displayed such a great array of emotions in this character I'd be hard-pressed to come up with names for all of them. We get glimpses of the people and places that made the man who he is, but we don't get too much; in fact he deliberately doesn't let us see these events and people. What we get is Swofford's life in the Corps. Always around is his Staff Sergeant, played wonderfully by Jamie Foxx. I had to remind myself at times that this is the same guy who won an Oscar for portraying Ray Charles; he absorbs himself into this character and he really puts himself in charge. Support is also offered from the ever-delightful Chris Cooper (who I swear doesn't make bad movies) and Peter Sarsgaard, who was equally moving in his role as Troy, a fellow Marine. It was also nice to see 24-alum Dennis Haysbert poke his head in as a Major, but his role wasn't all that big.The time spent in boot camp is minimal; ditto his post at Pendleton, though we can see through these brief glimpses that he is not exactly the favorite of his commanding officers. He makes the cut as a scout sniper when it is announced that Saddam Hussein (yeah, we all know that name) has invaded Kuwait, and that the United Nations have been called to intervene. So, we're going to war.Once Swofford and his fellow Marines arrive in the desert, they are literally bored out of their minds. First part of ""Operation Desert Shield"", meant to protect Iraqi neighbor Saudi Arabia from attack. It is here in the heat of the desert that the characters start to fall apart; especially from sour news back home of wives and girlfriends who have left our soldiers behind (one particular scene in which a soldier gets a nasty revelation by video is, although predictable, hard-hitting nonetheless). After a mishap over Christmas gets Swofford busted down to private, the war truly begins, but these Marines can't help but be disgruntled that they will not see any action. The war is moving too fast for the sniper, the infantryman. The soldiers persevere, though they are tested mentally and physically by the hot desert and the oil fires that burn brightly in the night sky. Before you know it the war is over, without having seen any combat, without even having fired their weapons; the Marines get to go home.The brains behind this beautifully personal and moving film are none other than Sam Mendes, the Academy Award-winner for American Beauty. So going into this film, I had high expectations, and they weren't let down in the least. Much as he did with his actors in American Beauty, every one of the actors (starring and supporting right down to extras) turns out something better than expected here. Mendes is proving himself over and over to be a great actor's director, bringing characters to life like you can't believe on the screen. That's not to say he lacks the gift elsewhere; this film looked beautiful too. Even in the desert when oil was falling like rain, Mendes somehow managed to make it look beautiful.All in all, Jarhead wasn't much of a war film, so don't go into it expecting to see much combat; you won't. Instead you'll get a beautifully-crafted, intensely personal film about soldiers on the brink of combat, and the trials and struggles they go through waiting on the edge of the front lines. Stellar performances by an all-star cast and some incredible settings and camera work will floor you. Another incredible film for Sam Mendes; definitely one of the must-see films of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"7th grade story, very insulting to military","The story line and writing was very poor. It had no direction or finish. The movie dragged on. The lingo was fake. During the opening seen the Drill instructor is overweight, nasty and has a mustache, he looks more like a cop. I'm a Ex Marine, 0311 machine gunner. The Corp is not like this. This movie showed all of the characters blood hungry and dumb. It had no character development. None of them l faced a challenge that changed them. They all lost control but it didn't matter because the movie eventually ended.This movie doesn't even compare to Platoon or Tigerland. Both I highly recommend because both were written by Vets. Jar Head was written as a protest movie by Holly wood. After I watched it I felt spit on. This movie does not like the Corp or the military. The cartoon GI Joe is more stimulating. The Jar Head disrespects all Marines. It gets a negative -10 out of -10",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Welcome To The Suck,"I saw JARHEAD last night. woah. It is a great movie! first, I think everybody should know that this movie is not just something thought up by a screen writer. It is a true account of the Gulf War, written by Marine Anthony Swofford. His book is the basis for the movie. and, i have not read the book yet, but the movie is kick a**! it shows what it's like to go through boot camp, and what it's like to carry the super heavy rucks, and it gives you an idea of just how hard it is for the men and women fighting in these wars. I have always respected soldiers, just because they were brave enough to risk their lives to protect our country. But after seeing Jarhead, I respect them for soo many more reasons.

good adaptation of Swofford's memoirs,"The title of the book is Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles. The other battles are within Swofford and his struggle to pull some meaning out of life. It seems that each time Swofford finds a goal or something important, circumstances in life take it away from him.He wants nothing more to be in the Marine Corps while growing up, to participate in a war. Once in, his efforts to make a difference and his sniper's passion for the perfect kill are so diluted that he quickly wants back out. The sniper's ideal experience is overrun by politics, bureaucracy, personality conflicts, worries about his girlfriend's infidelity, and nature of the first Gulf War, which emphasized spending monumental amounts of money to fight the entire war by air and avoid losing support at home through infantry casualties and up close reporting of the Hell that even winners of wars insist that it is.There are one or two scenes in the movie where things happen a bit differently than in the book, and some compartmentalized scenes from the book (mostly that take place back home) are left out, but it's extremely close, both in events and in overall tone. Many of Swofford's words are repeated in the movie's narration verbatim, no characters are combined to save time, no dialog is made up to give the movie a more comedic edge, jingoistic edge, anti-war slant, or anything of the sort. The book is a slice of life for a U.S. marine, make of it what you will, and so is the movie. Trumpets, waving flags, gory wounds, stirring speeches, and international politics do not impede or help Swofford's struggle to make something of himself, and although some may think that makes it rather pointless, in a way, that IS the point. The military cannot turn a scumbag into a hero, Saddam's crimes do not give your life meaning, being thrown together with a bunch of guys does not make you brothers, you must work for it like you would in the most ordinary of circumstances, and when Swofford gets back home, the same unemployment, family problems, alcoholism, and lack of direction that he and his fellow recruits once left are still waiting for him, and though the movie doesn't get into it, the book shows how a few of those new battles are won and lost by his former squad mates and the author himself. In that sense, some may find it boring, it certainly does not emphasize harrowing close quarters combat in the way that Black Hawk Down did, nor does it have a neat story like Three Kings, but it is an enlightening look into what impacted the minds of men in Kuwait as told by a very good writer. In that sense, it is very close to the recent documentary ""Occupation: Dreamland"" which follows an army squad in the current phase of the Gulf War, and the ordinary characters you see are very much the same.The filming was beautiful, the score emphasized the tension the men felt in Kuwait while the U.S. was still implying Iraq could easily win the war (""we're expecting 30,000 casualties the first day""), and the acting is top notch from Gyllenhaal, Sarsgaard, and Foxx. The characters are entertaining but still seem realistic, and 99% of the dialog is taken from the book, which is as true and accurate as Swofford's memory.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Excellent movie, but don't go if you're expecting ""Saving Private Ryan""","Like I said, this movie is a great movie, but don't go if you're expecting some violent war movie (like ""Saving Private Ryan"").

It could've deserved a 10 if there was just a BIT of action, but I'm not going to go out on that because I thought ""Jarhead"" is definitely the best movie of the year thus far. Some parts are abrupt, but nonetheless the way they filmed the movie makes all the difference, and the acting is beyond terrific. In fact, even if you ARE expecting a violent war movie -- disregard that thought, accept this as the movie that it is, and go see it anyways.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
What If A Fighter Is Never Given The Opportunity To Fight?,"There's a lot to love about JARHEAD, but there's an underlying current, too, that may effect some viewers negatively (specifically those that have been or are Marines.) Myself never having been in the U.S. Armed Services, I can't make those glib comparisons that others who've ""been there and done that"" might be able to. But what I can do is rate this film on its own merits and tell you why I gave it such a high rating.Like Sam Mendes' other film, American BEAUTY, which delves into the depths of suburbia and all its great and terrible significance, Mendes here takes hold of a U.S. Marine and shows us an excellent character study. But this time it's of a young man's ultimate genesis into a fighter.Jake Gyllenhaal (DONNIE DARKO and October SKY) is Anthony Swofford, a naive recruit with dreams of glory and medals, a dedicated American protector who takes his lumps during his early time in ""The Suck"" (the Marine Corps unofficial title given to it by the grunts). He rises to the station of a Marine Scout-Sniper along with Troy, Peter Sarsgaard (FLIGHT PLAN and KINSEY). And above them is Staff Sergeant Sykes, Jamie Fox (RAY), who ""loves The Corp"" and will never leave it.As Swofford makes it through boot camp and into the lower echelon of a Marine trained combatant, he is very willing, ready and extremely able to kill whenever the order comes.But what if it doesn't? This is the crux of the film.I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about JARHEAD before its release, and many have damned it for a message that I simply did not see, that being the making of a political statement or ""bashing"" the Marine Corp. On the contrary, I think Mendes held back on this point and skillfully allows the viewer to insert their own beliefs (if you lean one way or the other  pro-War vs. ant-War). And that's War with a capital ""W"". Because, let's be honest, that is what our Armed Services are trained for. They are trained to kill during wartime. And each man/woman brings with them their own justifications for this (be it ""In protection of my country"" or ""Because my father was a Marine"" or ""Because it was this or jail."") This film focuses on the relationship that Swofford develops with the Marine Corp and within himself. He is given the right tools (both psychologically and physically) to exterminate the enemy. He is beat down by his instructors and built back up into a killing machine (""This is my rifle. There are many like it but this one is mine...""). He's loaded with adrenaline as they enter Iraq for Operation Desert Shield. But the days begin to drag on and he begins to wonder whether he'll ever see any action and get to do what he was designed for (sharpshooting). Boredom sets in, and with it comes resentment and anger directed at anyone within reach (even men in his own platoon). But then a mortar attack on their outpost occurs. Slow motion blasts of sand cover Swofford's face, a sort of baptism into the War. He wets himself during this scene, but whether it's from excitement or fear is left up to the audience (I personally loved that part, as it might be perceived as another type of baptism.) Then we see Swofford and his platoon moving into the desert as they witness the burning of the Kuwait oil fields. They go into this muck and the feel of the film turns as dark as the petrol spilling from the infernal wells. Are they in Hell? My initial perception was that something bad was coming. But it never did.There is no ""War"" to speak of for Gyllenhaal's character. We never see a speck of enemy blood on-screen. No head splatters or bullet-riddled chest shots. The war is ""distant"", beyond his reach, and you begin to feel his frustration. Why can't he just kill somebody? (This is especially noteworthy when they are given the opportunity but it is quickly taken away.) All in all, this movie is a fantastic break from normal Hollywood form. There are no great external battles with dismembered bodies and the death of half the platoon. The battle here is compartmentalized into one man's struggle to find out what the Hell he's supposed to do as a killer when never given the opportunity to become one.(There is a great feel of dichotomy toward the end of the film when an obviously disenfranchised Vietnam Vet gets on-board the welcome home bus carrying the ""victorious"" Marines down Main Street; a ""victory parade"" that the Vietnam Marine never got.)",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Mother of all war movies,"The movie started too soon. I was still in awe of the King Kong trailer! MY GOD, it was GREAT! So anyway, the movie started while I was overwhelmed by the Kong trailer. I was already thinking ""this sucks"", before the first minute was up. But I thought to myself, ""hey, this isn't fair! I need to give it more time."" Welcome to the suck. What a roller coaster ride! What a welcome to reality - a reality most do not see. The movie most definitely sucks all your emotions from your soul at one point or another. Before this movie is over, you have sucked in as much as you can handle. Every breath you drew sucked in fresh air from stale history.Check your political views at the door. There is no need for that extra baggage. You will be subjected to insight you more than likely never had before. You thought war was ugly? Hey! You win a prize, congratulations! The thing is, you don't know what ugly is unless you have been up close. When you see this movie, you will be sucked into all that is ugly. Despite its ugliness, this movie is beautifully done. Art covers a broad area and this movie covers it all.After the first moments of the movie, it is easy to laugh because it is safe to laugh. After a certain point in the movie, when you know things are going to get serious, you are tempted to laugh(I am sure the movie makers tempt you, daring you to laugh) but you will probably hold it back because you can't see yourself being a part of the dirty jokes and wicked tricks on-screen. Subject yourself to the training and torture that these men have to endure and you may begin to see the humor. But in the meantime, thank God you do not have to go through this. Thank those who did this for you. Welcome to the suck.If you go (or went) for big war battles, disappointment will be your friend. Lucky you!

Yes, it is reality and it is well done by everyone. The creators and the actors all were great. It is my understanding that Jake Gyllenhaal broke a tooth when he jammed a gun into his mouth because he was so wrapped up in the moment. That moment in the movie was one of the best performances I ever saw. But even that moment is not so special compared to the performances everyone else gave. When you can remember these people are actors, you then realize, how great they were.This movie DID NOT SUCK!

OVerall a really good movie,"Before I saw this movie I had been seeing all the bad reviews it got. I said well you know what i am going to go see it anyway. I just got back and let me say, I was not disappointed at all. I am pro war in certain circumstances and i feared like much of the stuff that comes from the media this was going to be another anti-war, anti-military movie. However, I was wrong. This is the story of a marine who enlists in the army hoping to serve his country but he doesn't get what he expects. Jake Gyllenhaal does an amazing job that should earn his at least an Oscar nomination. Jaime Foxx and Peter Sarsgard are excellent in their supporting roles as well. This movie is very well acted and the strong performances help give the movie a feel that you are the only one in the theater and you are right there with them. Sam Mendes produces beautiful shots in a bleak desert. The movie is suspenseful, Sad, Funny, and Exciting all at the same time. There are times when you want to laugh but you can't. I found this movie to have a bipartisan view on war, military, and politics. This is one man's point of view on a conflict that hundred's of thousands participated in. Please go see this movie. YOu will not be disappointed. I do feel however that this will not be a major contender come Oscar season.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Unoriginal, inappropriate","This movie was very unoriginal. The anti-war genre is all about cussing, sex, and showing just how cruel war is. Now, I understand war is hell. But this movie takes the inappropriate parts of war and makes them center stage just for the shock factor.There was no plot, lesson to be learned, or message.The only good part of this movie was Jamie Foxx's performance. This movie was a waste of $7.50 and I will not recommend this movie to anyone. I have heard many former marines hate this movie and I can see why. Not only does this movie put marines in the worst possible light, it tries to show that they have no soul and are puppets of the US.NOT recommended.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
A surprisingly well-done film,"Jarhead will disappoint the majority of people who go to see it. That is not to say it is a bad movie. It's just not what the average member of its target audience will want to see. The average twenty-something male who goes to see Jarhead is looking for a war movie. Jarhead is many things, but I would not say it's a war movie. It is a raw, unsanitized account of life in the Marine Corps and life in a war zone. The hazing, the boredom, the frustration that the bureaucrats won't get it together, the fear, the uncertainty, the wondering whether one's significant other is being faithful while her man is deployed in a country he doesn't feel like defending anyway, the charred corpses of civilians, the fratricide, the tent parties held with contraband alcohol, the descent toward insanity.Jarhead was a prime opportunity to get up on a soapbox and preach the evils of war and film a treatise on the politics of Desert Storm. Thankfully, you don't see much of it in this film. Apart from the civilian casualties, lamenting that the soldiers were spending weeks protecting a rich ally's oil wells while the government decided whether or not they would bother to go to Kuwait where the real crisis was, and the scripted interviews with journalists (which the soldiers interrupt creatively), the political realities of the Gulf War are mostly absent from the movie.Many people are going to Jarhead to see action. There isn't much to be seen. There's plenty of humor and excellent acting (particularly from Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays the lead role of ""Swoff""), but these are not likely to impress the target audience. Couple that with a strange ending, and you're likely to hear a few grumbles from people who are judging it as an action flick rather than just a flick. Let them gripe. I thought Jarhead was an excellent movie, one I will go back to see multiple times. I'll also be buying the memoir upon which this true story is based.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An insult to Marines and to the Corp.,"After reading pretty many good reviews and seeing the trailer, we went to see Jarhead. About half way through the movie, we got up and left. I wasn't a Marine, served in the Army, but I have a bunch of respect for the Marines, and this movie showed absolutely no respect whatsoever for the institution or the men and women that serve. It was an insult. I can't believe that anyone gave it a good review. It made Marines out to be a bunch of confused losers. We currently have an all volunteer force that consists of some of the finest trained and motivated personnel that have ever served. They deserve much better than to be portrayed like this. Shame on everyone who had a hand in making this movie, and shame on the people who tout it as a hit.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
a war within,the previews to this movie are misleading in that the viewer thinks they will be seeing a full metal jacket or a black hawk down type film. this isn't the case as there is only one on screen death and a lotta waiting. the movie deals with the gulf war and one soldier's conflict within himself. Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) volunteers for the Marines and we follow him on his journey through boot camp and then into the desert storm conflict. the movie addresses issues about mental health of soldiers and the bonds created during service. i highly recommend this film to people who are looking to see a great drama with many comedic moments that come with several isolated soldiers in the desert. enjoy.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jarhead 10/10- Best Film Of The Year!,"Sam Mendes 3rd film isn't his best film but its still an amazing film. Sam Mendes has merged into becoming one of the greatest directors of all time after only 3 films (American Beauty, Road To Perdition).Jarhead isn't really your average war film with explosions and excitement left and right. Its a war film about the human condition. It examines how young men deal with boredom; with the possibility of a death that will probably never come. Its about being made into a killer and not being able to do what you love. Jarhead shows this perfectly, you can see the pain and frustration of every soldier on the screen.Jarhead is rigged with so many pluses its hard to count. Things like Cinematography, Score, Soundtrack, Art Direction are amazing in this film, but the thing that Jarhead really has to offer is Acting. Peter Sarsgaard, and Jamie Foxx are sure to pick up some awards this year for there amazing performances.The Best thing Jarhead has to offer is an amazing performance by Jake Gyhlenhaal. He is absolutely stunning in every minute of this film and deserves all the critical acclaim that is sure to come to him.Jarhead is th Best film of the year thus far, its a must see despite some mixed reviews that have been based souly on politics.

Dismal and excellent,"Programming men to kill, and then not letting them, is a dangerous and terrible thing. This movie won't satisfy your desire to see conflicted heroes overcome odds and blow up their adversaries; it will satisfy your desire to join the military, and it will satisfy your desire to put men on the battlefield.I'm sorry that the film is getting mixed reviews. Everyone seems disappointed, but I don't think this is the journey of the hero, this is the unmaking of the hero. You will leave the theater with a dismal sense of futility and dread. And for that, as a powerful tool for expressing 'the suck' of war and all its trappings, I give it a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The underlying story,"Excellent movie/casting. But it's not a political, pro/anti-war movie. Its view of the Corps is amoral.But it does appear to be making a judgment in the climactic scene at the airport tower.The two major players aren't individuals, but rather the ground forces and air power--the latter being mostly off screen and which the movie apparently takes a dim view of, at least in that situation. The Gulf War was the first, and maybe last, war almost exclusively fought and won by air power.The Iraq war has corrected that. And for those who believe these wars were for oil, why did we leave Iraq and Kuait then? Why aren't we taking the oil from Iraq now? Over the years, that's been one of the most absurd, knee jerk responses on the approved talking points list.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A film about a war, and wars in general.","""Jarhead"" ultimately operates as a movie with many messages, some of them stated quite plainly and others deeply embedded in the story of the characters. Don't confuse this with movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Black Hawk Down""-- this film does not glorify war in some roundabout way. Like ""Three Kings"" before it, ""Jarhead"" instead presents combat in a completely unique light, as only a sniper struggling in a high tech war could see it. His introspective, often silent observations drive the story about a group of eight elite marine snipers who spend nearly 130 some-odd days in Iraq. As Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) explains, it is at the same time a war that for him lasts four days. The impact it leaves behind however, is immeasurable.A character that downright denies the audience much insight into his past with a bold and direct statement immediately in the first 5 minutes of the film, we are presented with the nearly clean slate of Swofford, who initially wants genuinely to serve his country, despite the jokes about merely ""getting lost on the way to college"".He was not recruited, he reads Camus, and that's about all we're given. His character evolves afterwords into a realistic portrayal of a kid trying very hard to make sense of what is being thrown at him by the war as fatigues unique to the desert (as well as the more familiar stresses like that of the girl friend left behind) wear him down. Boredom and uselessness make him question his purpose in the war, and more importantly the role of the war in his life.Using Swofford and the men in his unit, Sam Mendes (director of ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"") masterfully presents a bleak at the same time violently vibrant portrait of youthful enthusiasm and pop culture-- where young soldiers refer continually to other films about war and try to act like the heroes portrayed in those films. Amidst beautifully stylized shots of blazing oil fires, friendly fire, and smoldering wreckage Mendes manages to make the sprawling desert as expressive as the period piece journey in ""Perdition"" or the home wrought with conflict in ""Amercian Beauty"" .With strong supporting performances by both Peter Sarsgaard and Chris Cooper that that blend vulgar humor and sometimes smart, contemplative dialogue, the film makes a bold statement about the nature of war, as well as the place of war in today's society. As Swofford says in the closing scenes, ""Every war is different, every war is the same.""",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Most likely the worst film ever made in the Military Genre,"It's difficult to believe that the author of this movie actually participated in the Gulf war, or even the military for that matter. The portrayal of the Marine Corps as a bunch of drunken bumbling fools is insulting. This movie is a complete dis-service to all who have served. The accounts of boot camp, what little was shown was a complete fabrication. It almost seems as if the author has either never served in the military or is so dissatisfied with his experience that he had to put as negative a skew on it as possible. There is almost nothing in this film that accurately portrays military service during the Gulf War. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It is by far the worst film I've seem dealing with military life, (and I've seen Oliver Stone's movies). There seems to be a growing trend of low ranking screw-ups trying to make their participation in the military seem more than it was, again look at Private Oliver Stone.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very good depiction of the Psyche of the Soldier,"I saw this movie on its opening day release, and can say I was quite pleased with it. Overall, it gives a very real, and personal look at the way war, especially a war as uneventful as Desert Storm, can affect a soldier who has been trained to kill for his country. While this movie stays away from any political soapbox talk, it does foreshadow the present, in several scenes. This isn't the typical war movie, in that it doesn't show a lot of shooting, bombing and killing, which is good. Too often war movies show these things and glamorize them. This movie shows that this is not the case, even for hardened Marines. Full of colorful characters portrayed by equally talented actors, this movie is a must see, simply for the understanding you develop for the affect of war.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazzing and different from most other war films,"I saw this movie earlier tonight. I went in there thinking it would be good and came out thinking it were amazing. The cast chosen for the roles were all so perfect for each part that they played. The acting performance were also amazing. The thing that this movie does that makes it different is that it shows the story of an individual soldier. Shows his experience being in a war, and it shows how it all changed him. The story begins by showing these young soldiers going through vigerous training equal to that of what the soldiers going into Vietnam had to go through. These men were told to expect 70,000 casualties. The mother of all wars they called it. The soldiers wait for months in the hot desert that happens to be 112 degrees everyday, just waiting for when they would be called to go to battle. The day comes when they finally go out to fight, but it only last for 4 days. Our main character doesn't even get to fire his rifle. All the training and waiting for this? This thought puts our main character into confusion. He feels as if he had accomplished nothing.If you're looking to see a war movie with big battles and explosions and killing. Please save your money and don't go see this movie. Go rent Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now. Something along those lines. But if you are looking to really get a feel of what it was like for and individual soldier to be in the Gulf war, then this movie is PERFECT. I loved it. Definitely one i will buy when it comes on DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A solid, but slightly derivative war song.","2005 was a very revelatory year for the actor Jake Gyllenhaal. Not only was he cast in a daring role as a gay cowboy in the Academy Award nominated 'Brokeback Mountain', but he also pulled off a very convincing portrayal of a hormonal, combat fueled jarhead that is swept up into the desert boredom of the early '90s Gulf War and Operation Desert Shield.There is a lot to admire in this adaptation of former marine Anthony Swofford's reselling of his Desert Storm experience. Sam Mendes once again proves his visual acuteness that he demonstrated in American Beauty and Road to Perdition. He once again takes advantage of hand-held camcorders in key documentary scenes, although by now it starts a little bit to feel like he's retreading old ground. But the grain-filled picture and oil stricken, bombed out, barren landscape gives the desert a hypnotic and gritty beauty that adds a visual splendor to the affair.More important is the casting, particularly Gyllenhaal in the main role. His frustration and existential angst as he battles insanity in the desert heat provides insight into the psyche of the marine corps, and what a defeating engine it is that swallows up these young men's lives. From what is portrayed here, fairly realistically I might add, it shows how their station in Kuwait and the Saudi oil fields is 99% boredom and 1% sheer terror, as the anticipation of the looming war advances. And when that war never materializes, the results are quietly devastating. These are people conditioned to kill and explicitly follow orders, and when their aggression goes un satisfied, they direct it at any other outlet they can as the pressure mounts. They truly do end up salivating like Pavlov Dogs.While parts of the film feel derivative of previous war flicks, with the training ensemble and devastation of the country's infrastructure resembling 'Full Metal Jacket', and the voice over narration recounted by Swofford on marine life similar to 'Platoon', Jarhead is still a solid and engrossing psychological drama that shows a heartbreaking truth in how these men never really escaped the desert heat.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Yay- a movie where we are not being spoon fed!,"I had to see this movie twice to fully appreciate it. The first time I watched it I was too distracted by Jake Gyllenhall's ass (yes, sad to admit that even though I am a nearly 30yr old woman I have a ridiculous ""14yr old girl"" type obsession with Jake!) So, I had to go back to watch the movie again because I was pretty sure there was a great movie that I missed the first time around. I was REALLY looking forward to this movie- yes in big part because of said obsession but also because I think Sam Mendes is a genius. American Beauty is in my top 3 favorite movies, not to mention that despite my better judgment- turns out I really do love war movies. I have to say that the movie didn't disappoint, but it's not easy to describe feeling that it leaves you with. I know Mendes has been catching flack for it with reviewers but I really have to hand it to him for not caving to the current political climate and making yet another movie with an in your face statement about the agenda of the United States. Don't get me wrong, we need to have these movies and I love them too but if we get too lost in political statements we loose sight of the human element; and with out making any excuses for itself, that is what this movie does. I am grateful to Mendes that he has enough respect for his audience that he allows us to make our own intelligent decisions about what he has just shown us. The fact that 2 days later I am still not really sure how I feel about what I saw is, in my mind, a true testament to a good movie. That is not to say the movie is without flaws. For a movie that is so focused on the experiences of its characters it would have been helpful to know more about them. It was a bit of a stretch to feel real compassion for any of them because we weren't given a chance to really get to know them. There are some very powerfully emotional scenes that I found myself really wanting to get into but the connection just wasn't there. Because of this some fantastic acting never gets to go anywhere- that feels disappointing. The acting really is very good. Not just from Jake who I have always know to be brilliant (so many reviewers seem to just be seeing him for the first time- for the love of god see ""Moonlight Mile"" people!!) but also from Peter Sarsgaard who never ceases to amaze. All in all, this movie is exactly what I look for when I go to the theater; something that makes me think, something that leaves me feeling a bit uncomfortable because I don't really know what I think. It is refreshing to be given that chance these days!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Pathetic Mess, and A Disgrace to The USMC","I usually only write a review when I really have something to say. This film at first left me speechless, then made me angry. Our troops have enough to deal with in the desserts of the middle east then to be portrayed as a bunch of mindless animals. We know how things can get for the guys out there when they're a long way from home, but we don't need to go through their intimate issues chapter and verse.Why didn't the filmmakers take Stan Kubrick's example of how a war film should be done. ""Full Metal Jacket"" along with ""Apocalypse Now"" are among the best illustrated war films along with of coarse ""Saving Private Ryan"". This was garbage on display. The infantry soldiers of the USMC are about far more than what was seen in this film. Marines concentrate and engage their attention to one thing most of the time, which is to kill the enemy. I was disappointed to see how the filmmakers opened the film with one racy scene after another.The bottom line here is, for the people who made this film they should be ashamed of themselves for disrespecting the branch of our armed forces which deserves the most honor, the USMC.Jarhead is a exploitive stereotype of what Marines strive NOT to be. For any one reading this review, if you love the corp and your country, don't see this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
tension throughout,"Tension. Tension between wanting to do your job and wanting to do anything to get out of the sand. Tension between wanting to kill and being repulsed by the very idea of killing. Tension between the disgust you feel for the inescapable vulgarness of certain others and the realization of how close any one of us is to that same vulgarity.The exaggerated tension of wartime is what Mendes displays brilliantly in ""Jarhead"". You feel, intensely, the conflicted emotions and thoughts that are unavoidable in the situation that so many soldiers have found themselves in, whether in Iraq, Viet Nam or WWII Europe/Pacific.Mendes does such a brilliant job of evoking that tension in this movie that I had to give it a 10 even as I admit that there were shortcomings in certain areas. The movie overcame all of the shortcomings in my mind. Certain parts came out of nowhere without any warning or further development. I'm guessing that some of that development is on the cutting room floor, as the movie is long already. I'd like to see the director's cut.The biggest hurdle for me was accepting Gyllenhaal as a twenty year old. That's not to say that he didn't do an outstanding job, he did. I just think that his physical and emotional maturity betrayed some of even greater sympathy that could be due a young soldier in the situation presented.The emotional letdown of the ending is actually what ties one to the character in a way that could not be done otherwise. I think that it is a major part of the genius of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The best war movie I've seen.,"A great movie. Excellent performances by Gyllenhaal, Foxx, and Sarsgaard. It reflected the war from a soldiers point of view very well, and evenly balanced both views of how Bush and his administration is handling it. Either way, though, these men were taught to ignore politics and do what they were told, because arguing why they were there was pointless in the end. My only wish is that we could've seen a little more of Chris Cooper, whose one scene was very well presented indeed. The writing seemed to reflect an almost love hate relationship with the Marines, showing both the honor and the bullshit of loyalty and rules. On the whole, this movie was moving and entertaining, and in a small sense, enlightening. And for a girl who isn't a big fan of masculine shoot-em-up war movies (which this very much is), I was surprisingly pleased.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Unlike any war movie I've EVER seen,"I walked out of this movie just completely blown away by how good it really was. Jarhead is the story of Anthony Swofford, who at the age of 20 years old enlisted in the marines. Academy Award Winner Sam Mendes directs this OUTSTANDING film.I would like to call this one of the most realistic war movies, this side of The Great Raid. If most of you guys have seen the movie Three Kings, this would be the other side of that movie. Jarhead isn't any traditional war movie most people will see. It focuses on the soldiers instead of the war, giving it one of the most unsettling effects you will experience.Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Anthony Swofford, a person who enters the marines as a normal guy with depressive qualities surrounding him. Gyllenhaal gives an Academy Award caliber performance because what he went through in the corps changed him completely. Gyllenhaal shows his emotional range, he's an emotional roller-coaster in this movie, and what he is in the end is nothing short of breath taking. Swofford walks in the corps not wanting to be there, but that all changes in the end.Peter Sarsgaard plays CPL Alan Troy, Swofford's best friend and staff corporal. Sarsgaard gives his most complete performance in this movie, stepping his skills up for director Sam Mendes. You can count on an Oscar nomination for Sarsgaard, and I will be deeply surprised if he doesn't get one for this movie.Jamie Foxx plays Staff Sgt Sykes, a family man who is DEEPLY faithful to the corps. You can see it in his every move, and even Foxx even states that he loves his job.This movie shows us people that war isn't as glorified as we think it is from all that influence us. This is still certainly a war movie, because the war itself is present in all the scenes, yet it gives us a realistic look at what REALLY goes on in a war. You can count on some Academy Award nominations for this movie as well, for picture, supporting actor, director, cinematography and editing at the least.This movie is a masterpiece, 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
waiting waiting waiting,"This movie is a terrific depiction of the frustration of waiting for something to happen that you have been intensely preparing for. At times hilarious, at times horrifying, ""Jarhead"" brings the daily life of a soldier into clear focus. The desert is a character on its own, with a horizon of bleakness that is disheartening. The film is so washed-out you can feel the heat, which builds the anxiety and boredom levels for the characters. The scenes of the burning oil wells are devastating, the rain of oil crushing, but you understand the staff sergeant when he lovingly says nowhere else could you see such things but in the Marines. ""Jarhead"" is well-made and well-acted, and definitely worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very Good,"I was pleasantly surprised.You may find it strange that I liked this movie. I am 13. A little young for this movie. And I'm a girl. You may be stunned. A girl? Loves the movie Jarhead?The language and content was a little too strong for my liking. But seeing as it helps the story and the emotions and the movie in its entirety, I am willing to forgive it. I strongly recommend that no immature or unstable person see this. Either they'll get ideas or call it stupid and ruin the movie for tasteful moviegoers. It's extremely provocative, in content and emotion. It's isn't enough to make you cry, but it is enough to make you want to go cuss out that neighbor you hate. I am a girl. And I too was surprised that I wanted to see Jarhead. I never had the chance to see it in theatres but I was pretty excited for it on DVD.I seriously doubt this movie wouldn't have been as good without Jake Gyllenhaal. I am a huge fan. I also like Chris Cooper and Peter Sarsgaard. The acting was excellent. Though it was kind of strange with someone asking me, ""So you're a huge fan of this guy?"" But who cares. And might I add, the cinematography was beautiful.Whatever you do, do not believe what anybody tells you about this film. Some say it's stupid because it doesn't have enough violence.

"A Throw-away War Movie for the ""Pop Generation""","I thought this movie was nothing short of a slap in the face to everyone who has, or is currently in the U.S. armed services. I know the movie mostly focused on Marines, but I'm sure the writers of this trash would blankly apply the same thoughts to all branches.I am not, nor have I ever been enrolled in any armed services. I am neither republican nor democrat. To see this movie portray most every marine as borderline psychopaths who are socially and romantically retarded, implying that the only reason they serve in the forces is because there's nothing else they're capable of but pulling a trigger... it did nothing but leave a sour taste in my mouth and make me realize how biased Hollywood is, and how much they really don't care about who they trash.So, to all you news-fed, brainwashed 'livestock' of today's generation, feel free to praise this movie and think it's nothing short of spectacular, but by no means believe this is an honest representation of our armed services.

a very good movie,"In my opinion, Jarhead realistically portrayed the inner conflicts of a squad of marines. it provides a real grunts eye view of the war, and portrays well the madness and hell that war is. Being trained to kill will stay with you for the rest of your life, is what Swofford says. There are a good, varying cast of characters that act just like real people. The acting is good, and i think that this is one of the better roles that Jake Gylenhall has done. Jamie Foxx' role is nothing compared to the brilliance of his performance in Ray, but if that is what you expect all the time, then you will be constantly disappointed. This movie will be known as the movie that really showed the madness that the gulf war was, and how people really do react to others in a war, in a time of tension. the only complaint i have is that it is a times quite slow, but the acting and characters make up for this mistake. this is not a movie for everyone, but is you are a fan of heavy real stuff, then this movie will be good for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The First 21st Century War Film,"I must say, as a fan of Anthony Swofford's book and of Sam Mendes, I have been waiting for Jarhead all year. The early reviews did not dishearten me, however, because many of them shared criticisms I had heard about the book (e.g., lack of a plot, etc.).I saw Jarhead last night, and I realized that most of the critics are criticizing what the movie is not rather than what it is. These are a select group of STAs (and I do not think this is representative of everyone's Gulf War experience, just Anthony Swofford and we are watching the film through HIS eyes) weened on Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket who have developed a thirst for the ""Sh*t"" and a kill. And the '91 Gulf War was NOT Vietnam, but it was as Swofford says ""his war."" This situation fosters the development of the characters, and is exacerbated by Chris Cooper's character, a Lt. Col. cut in the mold you would find in Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket who give Swoff and Troy hope that their war-time fantasies may come to pass, only to come up empty.And no, this is not a political film, but then what requirement is there that a war film should be political? It is a film about a war that barely happened, as George Clooney's character said in Three Kings - ""I don't know what we did here!"" Yes, Three Kings is a better movie, with stronger satirical bite than you will get here, but then again, Jarhead is based on a true story.Mendes and Broyles streamlined the non-linear structure of the book, turning it into the chronological narrative, which I thought was appropriate. Technically the film is superb, from the performances, to Mendes' direction, Thomas Newman's score, and Walter Murch's editing. And no, you do not need to have read the book to appreciate Jarhead. But see it for what it is - a modern revisionism of the American War Film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Account of Anthony Swofford's experience in the Gulf War and what it was like to be a Jarhead.,"All war movies are the same. All war movies are different.When I saw the commercial for Jarhead on TV, I was immediately interested. It was obviously a war movie, so that caught my interest; it had a good song (Jesus Walks by Kanye West) that caught my interest, and it seemed like it had a great cast (Jake Gyllenhall, Jamie Foxx), so that caught my interest as well. Hmmm, I guess I am very easy to manipulate.Anyway, I walked into the theater realizing that I really had no idea what this movie was about. I knew it was based on a book by Anthony Swofford about his experiences in the Gulf War, but that's really it.I couldn't stop laughing throughout the first forty five minutes. The whole movie had funny parts, but the first forty five minutes was hilarious. It's pretty much just all about Swofford joining the Marines and getting treated like garbage.The funny thing is that even when the movie ended I still didn't really know what to think of it. But, for what it was, I greatly enjoyed it. It's pretty much just about Anthony Swofford (Gyllenhaal) and his experience in the Gulf war under Sgt. Sykes (Foxx) and his sniper buddy Troy (Peter Sarsgaard). Sarsgaard is great in this movie as well.Swofford does not take any sides in this movie, or question why he is in Iraq in the first place. There is no politics involved, and there really isn't much drama involved either. It's really just all about the soldiers and what it was like to be a Jarhead.If you're looking for a war movie that has Braveheart-like action, this movie is not for you. But it is definitely a very unique, entertaining movie. I'm not quite sure how much former soldiers who did fight in the Gulf War would like this movie. That's an interesting question. Oh yeah, it is also very funny, which I established earlier. I'd give in an 8/10 and I'd recommend this movie to any one.Welcome to The Suck.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not what i expected-not a bad thing,","OK, this has already been said, this isn't like a ""Thin Red Line"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" (although they are both fine movies). The action here takes place in what isn't seen and in what isn't done. I did not feel that this was political movie in any way. I felt it was a story and a well told one at that. I'll continue the praise of the cinematography but I will also throw in that the soundtrack was pretty solid too. I liked it-and I judged it harshly. I was admittedly looking for some sneaky political message; however, all I found was good acting, a touching story (nothing wrong with a soldier crying), and well made film. Also as a final note, I enjoyed the voice-overs too, lol I am a sucker for well placed voice overs.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Insightful,"Jarhead isn't perhaps the most exciting war movie, but it gives you an inside look of what really goes on in the war. What the people suffered through, and what they did for that moment of fighting is broken down here. Solid performances were given by everyone, especially Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Foxx, and Peter Sarsgaard. Their performances alone is enough to make the movie good, but the directing and the effects also bring the movie full circle. The characters are all well rounded, and relationships formed throughout the movie give the audience a sense of understanding. Motives and actions play a key part in the movie, but it wasn't all talking. What the director tried to get across to the audience was clear, but you have to see the movie to interpret it for yourself. 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Rip-Off of A Classic,"Did you ever get the feeling that Hollywood has just been rehashing and updating the same movie over and over again? Well Jarhead proves it. For all the people that have called this a modern day Full Metal Jacket, you are right. Very right. Word for word in at least five parts this movie ""borrowed"" lines from FMJ. I mean seriously, is this their idea of paying homage to one of the best war movies ever made, by ripping it off? Maybe Swofford never thought it would get turned into a movie so he didn't mind plagiarizing in his book, thinking no one would ever see it. Or maybe just maybe its a sign that filmmakers are scared. They are scared to try new and exciting ideas or stories. I'm not saying all of them, but the majority would rather just repackage old films and hope to god that we have never seen them before, so you wont catch their lack of creativity, which this movie has pouring out of its butt. Don't waste your time. Watch FMJ instead, at least its ideas were original.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Breath of Fresh Air.,"With all the crap coming out these days like Chicken Little and Racing Stripes, It's good to finally have a good movie in theaters. For those of you who think this is a Spazy Liberal MOvie, no, it is not. BAsed off a book it is only telling the story of a desert Marine. Jake Gyllenhall's performance was even better then his in Donnie Darko! A must See if you like this kind of thing, but if you don't want to see ""Violence"" in any form at all. On the other hand, the movie grabbed me from the trailer! While at Serenety I had just finished laughing at the Doom Trailer and giggling at all the 10 year old kids ""Who left 5 min into the movie"" going ""G-G-G-G-G Un-AT!"" during the ""Get Rich or Dye Trying'"" trailer.

See Jarhead,War movies of any kind always get to me and I can't quite explain it. I only have one personal friend actually fighting in Iraq at the moment...but other than that no direct ties. I usually cannot watch war movies - like Full Metal Jacket and TigerLand I couldn't finish because they disturbed me so much. But I digress....this movie was amazing. Not because it was anti-war or pro-war. It just simply told what the world of one marines life was like. It made you think and it made you feel. And to know that your sitting in the theater all comfortable knowing you'll go back to your own home and its going on right now. People are doing that and worse RIGHT NOW. I cried during and after the movie. That last line 'We are still in the desert.' was amazing. Mentally (for those who are home from serving there) and for those who are there....wow. It was what it was. I think it just layed it out there and you take with it what you will. I took so much away from it and HIGHLY recommend it to anyone from any political background. Sorry if this was rambly but I just got back from it and have so many thoughts running through my head still....,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Movie That Pays Homage to the Classic War Movies and Then Some...,"""Jarhead"" follows the story of Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), a U.S. Marine Corps private who is sent to Kuwait during the Gulf War in 1989. Prefaced by about 30 minutes of Swofford during his basic training and sniper training, ""Jarhead"" explores the emotional implications of war and the chaos which not only surrounds the soldiers but his soul as well.The best aspect of ""Jarhead"" is the acting, which is the most important part of a movie that was made for the purpose of showing the physical and, more importantly, the mental tolls of war. Jamie Foxx plays a spectacular role as Staff Sgt. Sykes, a leader who seems to care more about his soldiers than about the war (but he'll be damned if he ever shows that). Sykes is a complex character, which seems to contrast perfectly with Swofford, who seems to be a one-dimensional figure on paper. But to truly see who Swofford is, you have to look deeper to discover a man so torn by his personal life that he seems to lose his sanity at the least harmful times, but gathers it once again when he is needed. This makes for a wonderful relationship between the two characters.The supporting characters all seem to rely on their fellow jarhead Swofford to not only carry their excess baggage, but to also overshadow their weaknesses with his overwhelming brashness. At heart, Swofford is an amazingly generous man but is at the same time deeply disturbed.The story is formulaic and is very similar to that of ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Platoon"". This, however, takes away just about nothing from the movie because the main focus is the complexity of the characters, which is done so well that the viewer will seem to think that the movie is totally original. The visuals are stunning as well. Seemingly endless miles of burning oil wells, bombs falling on desert sands that stretch for miles and miles, the visual insignificance of soldiers in the vast climate. It's all there for you to enjoy. And enjoy you will.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Impossible to watch,"Years ago I started watching this movie. Couldn't finish it as it was so brutally cynical, hopeless and pretentious. Just stopped in the middle or before then.Recently I started watching it again. Obviously I had erased from my mind the memories of the self-gratifying obscenities, the documentary supposed angle of it, the gross, graphic, and unnecessary sexual content, and all the rest of the F-wording.Well, same again. I remembered that I had watched this movie when I realized that I am going to quit watching, so dull and pretentious it seemed to me with all the nonsense that made it on the director's camera and in front of the weary eye of the viewer. That's when I realized: ""Ah! Now I remember this movie! I could not keep on watching the flick so I quit!"" Then I quit again.And decided to write a review to explain this phenomenon. How frustrating a movie has to be to remember it only by the fact that you had not been able to bear to watch it in the first place?There is one good point to it. At least these characters did not talk about their hemorrhoids. Well, I am not 100 per cent sure as I did not finish it.

war as poetry,"As far as war movies go, JARHEAD is one of the five best of all time.At times as rigidly cold as FULL METAL JACKET, but always as visually poetic as THE THIN RED LINE, it makes no political statements either way, but as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN showed the glory in fighting a war for freedom, JARHEAD shows the emptiness in fighting a war for oil. Jake Gyllenhaal moves up to the A list for actors and with the upcoming Brokeback Mountain seems a lock for an Oscar nomination. The rest of the cast is perfect in a variety of military roles, especially Peter Sarsgaard, who will not be overlooked at Oscar time for a third year in a row. It seems to me, anyone who wants to make a landmark movie just needs to hire Roger Deakins as D.P. The man could make home movies Art!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Sexual Deprivation, and other elements of war...","My favorite movie of all time is American Beauty, so I expected a lot from this movie, directed, of course, by Sam Mendes. Its sharp opening and initial surreally bright cinematography is reminiscent of Mendes, but throughout the movie I made the mistake of comparing this to Mendes's early work--when it in fact is nothing like American Beauty or Road to Perdition. And I think that is the mistake a lot of critics make in reviewing this movie--you must not look at Jarhead as another Mendes, you must look at it as a ""war"" movie superior to its contemporaries. Another mistake Jarhead reviewers make is looking at this movie as all action, snappy character development, just like other movies of its genre. This is the story of a man descending into anger and depression ignited by war. There are a lot of symbolic elements, a lot of themes that most people will not see when viewing. There is also the theme of political blindness, and sexual deprivation, maybe even suppressed homosexuality? In any case, Jarhead is a movie to see, and not one to just watch for entertainment. Is ""Mendesian"" in its literary qualities--irony, metaphor, symbolism, but at the same time, a thrilling and tragically hysterical movie experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Couldn't have loved it more.,"Don't expect this to be an action flick . This is not ""Band of Brothers: the Gulf War version"". It's a really great story told beautifully cinematically by Sam Mendes. Awesome shots, very funny and had me on the ""edge of my seat"" at times. There are shots in the trailer that aren't in the film, however. I wish they had been there, but maybe they'll make the director's cut, or at least the deleted scenes of the DVD. If you've read the book, I don't think you'll be disappointed. Obviously they can't use everything in the film, but it stayed close enough. Other than the cinematography, the highlight of the film (for me, anyway) was the performance by Peter Sarsgaard. He did an awesome job and I can't wait to see him nab a lead role. Very, very good movie and I definitely recommend seeing it in the theaters!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hollywood Antiwar Diatribe,"Any United States Marine will be appalled. I expected a contemporary story about the Iraq war and was surprised with a Desert Shield/Desert Storm story. Marines are depicted as crude, lewd, and undisciplined with girlfriends and wives almost guaranteed to leave or cheat. Worse yet, your fellow-Marines will regularly threaten you with bodily harm. The first half of the movie was fairly entertaining, but the second half was nothing but a disjointed antiwar political statement. Real Marines would never leave their brethren to wander aimlessly in the desert. Hollywood's ""message"" comes through loud and clear. Save your money.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
jarhead is fantastic,"first and foremost let me state something. my brother is serving in the marine corps, he just returned from iraq only weeks ago. so that brought even more feelings into the film for me. so here's what a brother of a marine thought.i just returned from the advance viewing of jarhead. and it was a full theatre i got there a hour early to find myself very far from the front. so far that i even got extremely shotty seats. which really didn't matter when the film started. it was some really amazing acting. jake and peter and jamie were damn amazing. the dialouge was great. and from the stories i've been told from my brother they seemed like marines to me. during one part of the film these oil fields get lit on fire, and it's raining oil and it's dark outside but light from all of the fires. some of the shots were fantastic. the characters were realistic and hard to watch. i didn't cry. but i walked out not knowing how to deal with the feeling i got from the film. it wasn't easy. but either way i would suggest everyone to see the film. it's not gloryfing war. it's showing all the emotions that go through the men that have to go over seas and do things that others wont. none of them seem like uber terminator heros, but humans. i would probably give it a perfect score. i loved it that much. and if any of you are expecting something action packed you won't get that. there isn't much action, it's all about the character interactions. it's an amazing film. i will be seeing it again",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Somewhat Flawed,"This film has some excellent parts to it but at the same time it comes from a perspective that is somewhat flawed. I say this because the author, LCpl Anthony Swafford, was very immature and his resulting lack of discipline caused him to leave the Marine Corps with a disgruntled mentality. The book this movie is based on reflects that skewed outlook. Add to that the fact that there are always inevitable additions Hollywood inserts to make a film even more sensational (than the book itself) and one should be able to understand that everything is not necessarily as it seems. For example, there is one scenario where the marines are told to don their protective gear and play football in 112 degree heat. Well, since military training is supposed to be as realistic as possible I suppose this could happen-but only for a very short duration and certainly not at the pace depicted. Later on, when they are then told to drink out of their canteens (while their protective masks are still on) we find that some members have busted canteen tops or have been missing their drinking tubes for some time. And I doubt this very seriously. First of all, these marines were deployed to a combat area where the use of chemical or biological agents against them was considered very likely. That being the case, their gear would have been checked and inspected repeatedly and on a regular basis. Further, any defects would have been corrected almost immediately. After all, this was a front-line military unit and not a group of reservists put together at the last minute. Now, for some people this might seem to be a minor issue, but this is just one item (out of many) that gives the appearance that these marines were sent into a combat area for a lengthy time and then totally forgotten about. So, while this might have been the message the author was trying to convey, the fact is that it may have been more his perception than actual reality. And again, his perception was probably clouded by his attitude more than anything else. That said, this film essentially revolves around a very narrow (and possibly imagined) point-of-view. To be sure, our soldiers and marines had to endure a very long and trying stint in the desert. It was lonely and they felt anguish for their loved ones back home. To that end, this film does a very good job of capturing the monotony and sense of isolation. But the ""hurry up and wait"" scenario is hardly a novel concept in this day and age any more than it has been with many armies for thousands of years. For example, siege warfare often lasted months upon end without the conveniences these marines had. Same thing with the Japanese soldiers on isolated island atolls during World War II. Not to mention the marine's Iraqi counterparts on the other side of the border who had to endure B-52 strikes with only their cardboard bunkers to protect them. Now, I don't say this to belittle the experiences our soldiers and marines had to endure, day in and day out, for over 6 months in such an arid and hostile environment. Again, it was a definite accomplishment and I think this movie does as much as any film can to capture that ordeal. But there were times when it seemed LCpl Swafford did more than his share of whining about his circumstances. Once again, it goes back to the source. Likewise, I thought there were some scenes which didn't need to be included and only served to make the Marine Corps look bad. That is not to say that the foul language wasn't unusual or that sex wasn't on the minds of these young marines. But was it really necessary to show them in such a crude fashion? Well, I suppose it might be if one had a negative attitude about what it means to be a marine. And again it all goes back to the author and possibly to those in Hollywood who have never served in the military. In short, this movie had some good points and it had some bad points. The depiction of the ""highway of death"" and the oil fields burning were definite highlights. But the negativity and crudeness brought on by the recollections of someone who was clearly bitter about his experience seemed to distort reality and diminish the overall effect.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"blew full metal jacket out of the water, or at least the desert","To start it off, this movie is incredible. Right from the very beginning it contained me and made sure i was not gonna leave this theatre.

In my eyes this is the best war film to day. There was great cinematography, awesome acting by all involved, a great story, and tons of action. oddly there was a lot of humor added in, which added to brilliance. the best part of the movie though is that it left me emotionally drained. there was happiness and sadness, guilt and glory, depression and elation; basically everything you want from a movie. i give this a nine out of ten, only because i want people to take this seriously and most wouldn't if they see a 10. watch this movie, and enjoy this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Great Piece of Filmaking.,"Ever since I saw the previews for this movie I had high hopes for it. American Beauty, one of Mendez's earlier films, was one of my favorites; and I was thrilled when I saw a trailer for a drama/war movie starring Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, Bubble Boy) ; whom I think is fantastic. This movie ended up being very good. The acting was top-notch (especially Jamie Fox's character), the soundtrack was good (Nirvana, T-Rex), and the cinematography was excellent. The only reason that I wouldn't give it a ten would be for the ending. I'm not saying it was bad, in fact it was good. But it could have ended on a higher note and with more meaning. The director did a great job of getting you involved with the characters; and showed the terrors of war without being extra gory or violent. This movie is definitely not pro-war. On top of the drama and war, there are many comedic moments in this film. I left the theater deeply moved; this film is very emotional and will make you a better person. I would recommend this drama/comedy/war masterpiece to everybody; that is everybody who would like to be part of a wonderful film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A good movie, but...","Thank God the Marines of Desert Shield weren't overseas during World War II, lest they would have all gone mad. From viewing the film, Jarhead, one would gather the poor blighters of Desert Shield were suffering Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from simply camping out in the desert for a few months. I had no idea a soldier could be so psychologically harmed from not killing. Peter Sarsgaard's character literally bangs his head against a wall, in a fit of rage, because he wasn't allowed to kill anyone, but he was only the spotter, anyway.My father was a soldier in the Pacific Theater of World War II. I'm sure he would have been very happy not to kill anyone and hang out in a desert for a few months, given a choice.The film is very engrossing and shows the human side of the anti-event.

liberal propaganda,"I think this movie is nothing but a bunch of liberal propaganda.

I was particularly upset about the way military wives were portrayed. Not all of us are sluts and whores who cheat on our husbands while they are overseas. While some may say that this movie is not deliberately political, I beg to differ. I think it one hundred percent representative of most of Hollywood's anti Bush anti war sentiments. Let me just say that my husband serves this country with pride and sacrifice. Anyone who craps on that for ANY reason doesn't deserve the freedom he fights for. I just expected more from someone who also has served, but was sadly disappointed.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
I liked it for its character arch.,"I like Tonys characters growth in the movie. Every character needs to start at a place and end up at another in a movie, however, I particularly enjoyed the metamorphasis from confused young teenager, to hardened marine that Jake G. manifested on screen. I love Jakes acting and every movie he is in seems to become a favorite of mine quickly. He obviously has a talent for making a character his own, and it really shows in this movie when you follow his painful yet inevitable struggle with his ""back home relationship"" Jamie Foxx really did his homework on this one also. He definitely was your typical marine, yet he brought a modern, fresh, smart element to the character that made me want to watch his every move and decision because you knew there was a reason for it. I only wish the movie was longer because in seems when I watch war movies I tend to enjoy living in the characters struggles, and feeling, in some small way, my own sense of time being stretched across my conscienceness. They did a good job of illustrating the boredom of the characters, and I am sure it was long enough for everyone else, but I truly enjoy just getting seriously lost in the middle of a movie and really feeling like I'm there with the characters. As long as its done right of course. I also thought the end did not provide enough conclusive elements and now I must read the book.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A realistic look at the psychology of a Marine,"If you're expecting this movie to be full of fighting or to make some social commentary on the current war in Iraq, then you will be disappointed. The most profound political statement in the movie is ""F--- Politics."" The only fighting consists of a few bombing scenes. But you have to remember, this was the first Gulf War, which lasted about 4 days. This movie takes a look at the making of a Marine sniper and the psychological aspects that go along with it. It has some aspects from Full Metal Jacket, but don't count it out as an imitation. It isn't. Swafford, the main character, is a sniper in the Marines. He deals with the pressures of the other Marines, the inbred desire to kill and the strain of having a girlfriend back home while he is stuck in the deserts near Iraq, thinking a massive battle is waiting. As you know from history, there were no major ground battles in the first Gulf War, and these Marines deal with all the anticipation of war with out ever getting to experience it. I think the author of the book compared it to building up for a sexual release and never experiencing it. There are several emotional and mental conflicts in this movie, which I think are excellent. They seem to be the real issue for a soldier, not the actual fighting. It also deals with the difference between soldiers who are in for a short term and the ones who are in for life. I think this is a fascinating aspect of the movie, and is handled brilliantly. So if you want a psychological and emotional look at being a soldier, watch Jarhead. If you want a ton of action and fighting, go watch something else. If you want political commentaries, go watch Fox News or CNN.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Secondly, any soldier, especially Marines, should be up in arms as to the conduct portrayed in this movie. My platoon treated the airline crew with respect as American Soldiers should. The action left me wondering whether the author of this novel spent time in combat or sat in a GP Large drinking chilled beverages. There would never have been any foot patrols allowed to be inside the burning oil fields and as far as the ""highway of death"", although depicted very well, such a small patrol would not have had access.

Very good,"This movie is not what I expected. I expected your typical war movie, with carnage, killing, gun fights, bombs, etc. That was not at all what this movie was about. That being said it was still a good movie.The movie looks more at the psyche and life of the soldiers in the first Gulf War. Now there wasn't much ground combat in the Gulf War, and a lot of sitting around for the ground forces. This movie showed perfectly the stress of anticipation and its effects of moral and the minds of the soldiers. It also showed, to a small degree, the interaction between soldiers and their loved ones back home.Jake Gyllenhal and Jamie Foxx are incredible together. If both of these guys aren't nominated for an Oscar I will be shocked. Gyllenhal portrays every emotion perfectly. The fear, the anger, the mental break down, everything. Foxx is excellent in his supporting role as the staff sargent. He is an excellent mentor figure.Overall this movie, while lacking in action, is very very good.

And just like in American Beauty, Mendes makes great use of the voice-over throughout the movie.It's hard to say exactly what it's about- its certainly funny at many parts, sad and poignant at others, and thought-provoking overall.

"Incredibly realistic, historically valuable brilliancy","Jarhead makes a difficult achievement; it portrays war, and hence politics, without a slant either to the left or right. The movie is like a photograph rather than a portrait in that it tells it like it is without adding the strokes or color of the painter. The plot line of the movie itself mirrors what the ""plot line"" of Swofford's experience must have been like. It is never predictable, it doesn't follow any movie formula, and for these reasons I highly praise it. Jarhead is not only a masterful piece of cinematography, but it is also a brilliantly true character study that allows its audience to come to their own assumptions regarding the politics of the time. Some critics are condemning Jarhead because of its ""lack of point"" or climactic delivery, however that is precisely what gives this movie such value; it is true to real life. Real life doesn't follow a climactic line, doesn't always deliver satisfaction, and often lacks a focused point. For the film to do otherwise would cheapen the experience. Jarhead is an entertaining, moving and historically valuable film that will be placed with the rest of the classic war movies. Go see it. It's worth the 9 bucks, and then some.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worst portrayal of US Marines.,"I just watched the movie Jarhead. It was your typical Hollywood anti-military, anti-war, propaganda piece that Joseph Goebbels would be proud of. They portrayed the Marine Scout Snipers as sexually deviant, drunken degenerates who just wanted to kill in combat. Don't waste you money renting this piece of crap. As a former Marine I can tell you we were a wild bunch, but nowhere near the screwed up idiots portrayed in this terrible piece of cinematic dogma.

A war movie without the fighting,"I had anticipated this movie for some time, so naturally I was worried about getting too hyped up about it. I don't have extensive knowledge about the mentality of Marines, but this movie came across as being very honest about the psyche and attitude of Marines in the modern United States. It's not pro- or anti-war, it just is what it is.Jarhead simply tells the story of a Marine briefly before, during, and a little after the Gulf War. The film explores war more internally than externally, in large part because it was directed by Sam Mendes. The movie consists of many scenes where characters talk about how they feel, scenes where Swoff tries to keep himself together while worrying about war, hoping to see some action in the field, and dealing with being away from his girlfriend, and scenes of Marines hanging out and acting how young men act. Acted brilliantly (Gyllenhaal, Sarsgaard, and Foxx keep the movie from ever feeling fake or dull), composed beautifully (the cinematography is wonderful, and Thomas Newman's score, as always, blends very well with the soundtrack for a distinct emotional tone), this is one of the best movies about war and the effects it has one people I've ever seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Well boy was he right, I thought this was supposed to be about the Gulf War, instead we hear more about how the main character (Jake Gyllenhaal) likes to masturbate. Also I hated how they made the soldier's out to be like nothing but a bunch of horny perverts and complete dumb asses, which is far from the truth.All I can say is if you want to see an entertaining movie along with a plot you need to look the other way. There have been very few times I have had to turn off a movie while in the middle of it. Sad to say but this movie was bad in all aspects. Bad performances by Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx along with the rest of the cast. I don't call using the f-word every other word acting, anyone can do that. There was no plot to this movie either, this movie would of been better off being called Soldiers Gone Wild because it was more about sex than the actual Gulf War.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
The movie makes a point but not a good time for mocking the military.,"Below are two critiques of the movie ""Jarhead."" Now, before you take the time to read these critiques, please note this: the main problem with this movie is not that it mocks the Marines, but rather the timing of this movie, being released at a time when over 2,000 Americans have been killed and thousands more injured in a war that has been going on for over two years, thus seriously undermining the movie's credibility and calling into the question the judgment of the producers who for reasons probably known only to them decided to release a movie mocking an organization whose members are being killed almost on a daily basis.""Be All That You Can Be."" That's what the commercial says about joining the military. Along with the message are images of soldiers looking sharp and handsome, clean cut, ready to serve their country proudly and with honor. And then there's the military according to the movie ""Jarhead."" In this movie, once you join the military, in this case the Marines, you have immediate license to become, and indeed are expected to become, a complete, unmitigated, unmistakable, certifiable degenerate. If this movie doesn't convey any other message, it conveys that one, loud and clear or should I say ""front and center""? According to ""Jarhead"" which means empty-headed, like no brain or no intellect, only the misfits of society become soldiers. Anyone with a brain, or with any sense at all, is doing something else, like, for instance, f----- your girl. And when you come home from the war, which in this movie lasts four days, after six torturous months of waiting in the middle of nowhere, the only person who personally greets you is a Vietnam Veteran of questionable mental stability. According to ""Jarhead"" not only are the enlisted soldiers of questionable moral and intellectual fiber, the officers are even worse - they won't even let the soldiers fight. Indeed, according to ""Jarhead"" being a soldier means using profanity, denigrating women, being irritable, being prone to impulsiveness, mocking your fellow soldier, and being a basic screw up. And the last is shown by what happens to the soldiers when the go home after their four-day war - they are all outside the mainstream of society, unable to adjust, incapable of adjusting - complete screw ups. According to ""Jarhead"" joining the military means a life of unbearable tedium and boredom interspersed with episodes of in-group violence and drunkenness, egged on by non-commissioned officers who have nothing better to do then torture their own troops with meaningless details like piling up sand bags and then taking them down - in the rain. Duh! According to ""Jarhead"" names like Tarawa, Iwo Jima and Okinawa mean absolutely nothing. The exploits of the Marines in years past are simply forgotten. According to ""Jarhead"" if you'd mention D-Day, the modern-day Marine may say: ""D-Day? Duh! What's that? Don't bother me with history, just give me my beer! I wonder if Jodie is f----- my girl? Ugh! Who cares anyway? I'm not worth waiting for."" Where's John Wayne when we need him? Where's Robert Taylor? Where's Lloyd Nolan and William Bendix? Where's Dana Andrews and all the other movie heroes that glorified the military and made the audience swell with pride at the mere sight of the American flag? If you asked a ""Jarhead"" Marine, he'd probably say: ""DUH! Gimme a beer you f-----g idiot and stop wasting my time. Who the heck are those guys anyway? And WHO CARES?"" Although mocking the military is nothing new, doing so during a time of war is, to put it mildly, poor timing and in bad taste. Maybe the war in 1991 was four days old; the current war has been going on for two and a half years with no sign of abetting, and during that time the U. S. has lost over 2,000 killed and many thousand's more injured. Let Hollywood make a movie about THAT!!!""Jarhead"" is the perhaps the most unflattering portrayal of military life in the long annals of Hollywood movies. According to this movie, once a person puts on the uniform he immediately regresses to the level of a five year old child - impulsive, tempestuous, violent, irritable, acting-out, yet dependent on higher authority for direction and survival. Moreover, this regressive and pathological behavior is not only condoned by the military, it is positively encouraged. Further, this movie also suggests that once you are in the military you are no longer a part of mainstream society and are treated accordingly by others outside of the military. In addition, this movie also suggests that the military gives license to behavior that is so maladaptive that it's almost laughable. Further, this movie suggests that large armies are now obsolete as wars are now fought not for territory but to achieve certain political or economic objectives that have little to do with actually having to conquer and occupy land. Far from being one of the foundations of our society, the military, as portrayed in this movie, is little more than a depository for all the social misfits who cannot fit into normal society. In fact, in ""Jarhead"" there isn't even much of a war. But that's in 1991; in 2005 the situation is far different. By the way: What's wrong with hurrying up and waiting? Better to wait, be bored, do your gripping and go home disgruntled but alive and well than fight and die for nothing. If someone is thirsting for glory, let them rent ""Sands of Iwo Jima.""Even though the movie conveys an unfair and negative message about the military and seems to have a certain political slant, this is still a powerfully compelling movie about the brutalization of soldiers who are expected to fight and die - even if there's no enemy. Accordingly, I give this movie an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A terrific film,"Quite an amazing movie.Certainly not an average run-of-the-mill war film, this movie strays from the norm and does it truthfully and often times painfully. Gyllenhall is haunting along with the rest of the cast, and this has to be one of the most personal war movies I've ever seen.Disturbing on many levels, this film is as heartfelt and poignant as it is vexatious and torturous. Jamie Foxx delivers another solid performance, but the movie is held together by Gyllenhall and the other young marines comradery and dialogue. I enjoyed the ending, even though the true theme of the movie is hard to define, it is definitely worth the time and money. This was an awesome film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent Movie.,"I almost compare it to Full Metel Jacket of our day. Dealing with the mindset of soldiers during a war is a refreshing look at war. Too many times movies are made about war and the main character is how real they can make explosions look and what not. This was a great character study. I admit it got slow at a few points but the entire audience I watched it with was into the movie up until the credits rolled. I watched this movie with my Marine brother which added some sentiment for me, but i intend to go back a few times to really soak it all in. Go and watch this movie. Don't expect to see bombs bursting, blowing people into little pieces. Exspect a movie that shares what Marines go through in protecting our great nation.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Anti-Marine Corps, Anti-American, Anti-Personal Responsibility","As a military veteran who deployed to Saudi Arabia in August of 1990, 10 days after the invasion of Kuwait, I was both disappointed and insulted by this negative portrayal of America and the United States Marine Corps.The vulgar, self-indulgent, immature behaviors exhibited in this film are fantasies that, when viewed by our adversaries, will only serve to enrage them and weaken us.Why is the film industry hooked on Anti-Americanism and Anti-Militarism? Why do they spew vulgar distortions of America and its citizens that feed Anti-Americanism overseas? Who will they call on to protect them when the real bad guys show up with a sword?

Lite Metal Jacket,"Jarhead is a war movie that's as much about war as Raging Bull was about boxing. That is, it's a film about isolation, boredom, and when you just boil it all down, sexual deprivation. Jarhead has a premise to be exceptionally good, and at times, it is. But it's storyline is messy. If Anthony Swofford was an unreliable narrator in the purest sense of the word, that would be okay. Throughout the film, we are given a glimpse into his fears of coming home to an unfaithful girlfriend, as his brothers in arms fantasize about sleeping with her. These scenes, in particular, really stuck with me. Already tormented with insecurity, it would have been really powerful had Jarhead focused in on Anthony's growing paranoia about his relationship. Mendes only makes this aspect one of the many symptoms of the isolation of war. To that effect, Jarhead on the whole feels like a spiritual reboot of Full Metal Jacket. Not that that's a bad thing, but it's not something we haven't seen before.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful war film that doesn't focus on the war as much as the fighters,"Jarhead can be described in one word : Incredible. An absolutely intense and horrifying look at what being a soldier is all about. This is not anti-American, or anti-war, it's just and amazing look at on man's life during wartime. Gyllenhaal is absolutely PERFECT as Swoff, as are Foxx (Staff Sargeant), and Saarsgard ( Troy). Certain scenes make you laugh, others cringe, others cry, and others just sit there mouth open and staring. The film is a complete immersion into the life of a soldier while they are still young, in love, and scared. A definite must see for anyone who wants to see from a new perspective, or have a wonderful time at the movies. I recommend this to anyone who is ready for an experience, and a film that they will not forget for a long time, and hopefully the Academy won't forget either. Gyllenhaal is a shoe in for a nomination, and I think a win.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Hilariously dark, beautifully shot!","I just loved this film, it really wasn't what I had expected and in no way should be described as a war film, in the traditional sense! If anything, this film is a true war film, and is leagues above rubbish like Saving Private Ryan and films that trivialise war and suffering.Set in the first Gulf war, Swoff joins the marines instead of going to college and ends up being sent to Iraq. His experience of war is very different to what one might expect, but shot in a way which still keeps the viewer in anticipation about what comes next.Jake Gyllenhaal shines in the lead role, and Peter Sarsgaard also puts in an amazing performance. The cinematography is lush, with beautiful wide screen shots of the oil fields of Iraq and others which I won't go into as it will spoil seeing them! The music for this film is great, chosen very well so that its really funny when it kicks in!

You need to watch Jarhead!,"oh my god i just watched jarhead and it is amazing.. what makes it unique among all the other war films is that its not based on all the action in the war but is more based on the soldiers, how they dealt with the war and what they did. This may put some viewers off but any fans of ""full metal jacket"" will love this film. This film makes you want to watch more and more. With its black humour this film can also be very serious too Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the main character as he tells the story of what the soldiers did in the gulf war. With brilliant screenplay and superb acting this film is definitely a great start for 2006. This is the third movie brought to us by Sam Mendes and is hopefully not going to be the last.For people who seek action this is not a movie for them. This film is about soldiers waiting to go into battle, Jake Gyllenhaal stars a Swoff, a soldier who wants to see action and war but instead all he can see is sand....",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
worth watching,"I have seen a few other films with Jake Gyllenhaal in, such as Donnie Darko, The Good Girl and Brokeback Mountain, and I was always impressed with his performances. When my brother mentioned Jarhead to me positively, I was keen to watch it, and when I did, I was not let down. What I like about this film is that it is quite different from other war films I have seen- not much actually happens, which is the point really, but my attention was not lost. Another brilliant performance from Jake Gyllenhaal, and just as good were Jamie Foxx, Scott MacDonald, Peter Sarsgaard and others, giving a very realistic image of ""jarheads"". It kept a slightly brutally sinister side to it, and I liked how it seemed that some deaths were more important than others. Although Jarhead had great acting and good camera directing, I don't think I would go as far as to call it a favourite of mine. It was narrated by the main character, Swaff, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, and I think perhaps the narrations were rationed to give it a more even, realistic effect, but I think it would have improved the film if there were more of it. I felt it could help the audience feel more involved and see things better from their point of view. It could also help them understand the point of the film more. I did feel a little like the audience was just sitting on the side, watching everyone else, when it should have been a part of it. I was also a little bit disappointed with the ending, I felt like I wasn't left with anything to think about, and if my last thoughts on the film were negative due to this ending, I feel I'm left feeling unhappy about this film, when it, all in all, was quite good. Apart from these bad points, I think it is worth watching, with good acting, pleasant subtlety, and, to be honest, Jake Gyllenhaal looks quite good topless.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Really, Truly, Just Awful","I truly cannot understand why this movie was made. Entertainment? Pushing a point of view? Make sure Jake G. can be seen in something? Because Jaime Foxx said yes to doing it? Oh my goodness, this movie has every war cliché you can think of, they've all been done, and they can be seen again in this movie. I think it's trying to be a cool Full Metal Jacket, but it comes off as just trite compared to that film. I will say the cinematography and music were A+, but the story is so weak and pointless that it left me limp. I truly didn't care if his girlfriend was having sex with another guy back at home, or that waiting in the desert to fight makes you ""crazy,"" or how uneducated and stupid this director makes the recruits look, etc, I just didn't care. What's new, what haven't we seen it this movie? OK, well, we've not seen anything about Operation Desert Storm before. But who gives a rats ass?!! Trust me, this is an awful movie, though pretty to look at, if that's your thing.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"very impressive, thoughtful war drama","""Jarhead"" is a war movie not really about war. Rather, it's about that strange time before war, when young men and boys are trained to kill without hesitation or remorse, when group-think and group cohesion become the goal of every soldier, and when the boredom and tedium of waiting for the enemy to strike can be almost as unnerving and unbearable as the horrors of war itself.The film is based on the true story of Anthony Swofford (superbly embodied by Jake Gyllenhaal), a Marine sniper who served in the Gulf War in 1991. The story begins in 1989, as Anthony is undergoing the grueling rigors of boot camp training. When Saddam Hussein invades Kuwait, Anthony is shipped off to the Middle East as part of the operation known as Desert Shield, soon to become Desert Storm. For Anthony and his fellow Marine sharpshooters, it is the waiting that turns out to be the least endurable aspect of the assignment, as they battle the discomforts of life in the Arabian Desert - and often each other.At no time does ""Jarhead"" pretend to be anything other than the story of one particular soldier in one particular war; we never get the sense that Anthony is supposed to be representative of all Marines at any given time. As such, the movie eschews politics and philosophy, avoids heavy-handed moralizing and preaching, and refuses to either glorify or denigrate the men who are its subjects. Instead, it keeps it all life-sized and realistic, showing us how ordinary men cope with the extraordinary life of being a Marine in times of peace as well as times of war. Writer William Broyles Jr. makes every moment count as each of the major characters confronts some sort of personal demon, although Broyles never overstates the issues or indulges in cheap theatrics or hyperbole. The men remain complex and real, with each character drawing both strength and weakness from those around him.Director Sam Mendes keeps the scale intimate and the story tightly focused on the interplay between the men, reserving most of the actual fighting scenes for the final act. The film is filled with memorable moments and unforgettable images that often border on the surrealistic: the boys achieving a near-orgasmic frenzy watching the helicopter scene in ""Apocalypse Now;"" their stumbling upon endless rows of burned-out vehicles filled with charred corpses of fleeing civilians; oil from set-afire wells raining down from ink-black clouds, turning day into night and covering the earth with a thick coating of sludge and ooze; an oil-drenched horse mysteriously emerging out of nowhere only to disappear back into the vast wasteland of the ruined, darkened landscape. The film is worth seeing for its imagery alone.Those seeking a traditional war film - one heavily laden with booming artillery and graphic battle scenes - may find ""Jarhead"" a bit of a slow go at times, but those in the mood for a film about personal relationships set in a military context will find much to celebrate in this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Man's estate,"You are born, grow up, go to school and then instead of going to college you go to a recruitment center to enlist in the marines, become morally and physically subject to the worst and most abject violent acts executed by superiors and comrades upon you, become a marine (a jarhead), are sent to the ""suck"" i. e. the war, kill and are killed (or not) and finally come back home (or not) to lead the same meaningless life staying a jarhead on your mind for the rest of your life. That's what this movie is about, that's what it shows us through excellent images, dialogues and monologues. And if the second part appears a bit duller than the first one this is not the fault of the movie it's because marines' lives in the desert during the first Gulf War were dull indeed. Some of them never had the opportunity to let off their guns. Despite lacking some specially dramatic or epic scenes like other war movies, the message it conveys is not less true or effective.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""A story: A man fires a rifle for many years, and he goes to war."" ... And sometimes, he is left dissappointed","""Jarhead"" has always stood out in my mind when I think of the essential war films. Up there in good company with the likes of ""Platoon"", ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". On first glance, before viewing, Sam Mendes's adaptation of Anthony Swofford's book about his personal experiences in the US Marines during the First Gulf War in 1991, could be dismissed as some glamourous Hollywood matinee. But it truly is a fine psychological study of men at war, and an authentic snapshot of what war can, and often is like, for soldiers; sometimes boring, with sustained periods of high-stress and readiness, rushing to battle only to find that the war has already moved on up the road when you get there.Swoff is a young man 'lost on my way to college' when he enlists in the US Marines. After training, Saddam has invaded Kuwait and the West answers the call to defend the oil fields - in Operation Desert Shield - before the inevitable offensive to drive Saddam back into Iraq in Operation Desert Storm. An elite trained sniper, Swoff, like the rest of his platoon, can not wait to get into 'the suck'. But when they get in country, they find themselves stranded in the middle of the desert, preparing, masturbating, and waiting, and waiting, for their war to begin before it is over. A very intimate portrayal of men at war, Nirvana's ""Something in the Way"" accompanies a very poignant scene where our disillusioned and restless protagonist, homesick for a potentially unfaithful woman, dreams in the stifling heat.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Poor imitation of 'Apocolypse Now',"Artistically I think it is very bad imitation of 'Apocalypse Now'. However, I could see how many would like it because of its intensity, drama, and vulgarity. Some may like it because they may think they are getting a taste of 'what it was really like' because of its autobiographical style.Which brings it to the next problem: Factually Awful. So inaccurate of the United States Marine Corps and the Gulf War I don't even know where to begin. Normally this wouldn't bother me. As an historian I have long accepted Hollywood's version of history is poor at best, terrible at worst. The first thing that usually dies is accuracy sacrificed in the name of drama, which I accept, or the film makers 'point of view' (ideology) which I have more of a problem with.More and more films from Hollywood treat history as propaganda, as much as Stalin or Hitler used film for the same purpose. The only difference is Hollywood still has to make a profit so they still pay attention to good drama. The bad part is that the majority of people today get their education, not from learned books written according to the highest scholarly standards and subject to peer review, but from Hollywood. Hollywood, who's only two standards are profit and political utility.'Jarhead' has fallen to these twin demons and portrayed the Marine Corps as populated with a bunch of vulgar, coarse, wanton savages with little discipline or direction from their NCOs, and even less from their officers who are, for the most part, non-existent. One wonders how such a sex crazed mob could fling themselves right into the teeth of an army far larger than they with months to prepare their defense and defeat that army in an astonishing four days. A vulgar mob could not do such a thing, only highly trained & disciplined, proud professional soldiers could do so.Alas, the average viewer won't think to ask this question.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hollywood cheers another military loser,"When I was in the Marine Corps, I had a roommate named Watters. Everyone called him ""Muddy,"" not so much for any musical talents he possessed, but because that summed him up completely. He would set his alarm for 5 a.m., then hit snooze six times because as he told me, ""Five is too early to get up."" He would think nothing of driving 40 miles away on a Wednesday night for nickel beer at some out of the way dive. He ""acquired"" items from fellow Marines, and treated my personal property as nicely has he treated his, which is to say not very well.For barracks inspection, he would throw his laundry in a rucksack and keep it in the back of his pickup. On one glorious day he came in the room, visibly upset, someone stole his rucksack from the back of his truck. Though I wondered why someone would want his dirty undies, I smiled knowing he was out a $100 ruck.The image of Watters is what I immediately thought of when I read Andrew Swofford's 2003 book, ""Jarhead."" Swofford stole from his fellow Marines, shirked duty, took credit for other's work, and thought he was he a typical Marine. In other words, Swofford and Watters would have gotten along just fine.Many Marines have a love/hate relationship with the Corps; this was defiantly true for me. I felt that at times the Corps was the only family I would ever want or need. Then other times I wanted a personal protection order and divorce.Swofford's relationship was decidedly hate/hate. His book was a clearinghouse for ""sea stories"" and urban legends that Marines tell each other while drinking. They would start ""I swear, this one time"" then everyone would roll his eyes because he heard the same story many times before. Swofford's stories inevitably ended with him, or some other Marine, looking like a psychopathic deviant. No Marine officer worth his or her pay would tolerate Swofford's insubordination and misconduct. He is the type of Marine, soldier, airman, and or seaman that leadership would move at once to remove before he could ""infect"" others.Because of Swofford's view of the Marines, it makes perfect sense Hollywood was scrambling to put his story on the silver screen before the book's publication.However, in a movie industry controlled by people that proclaim they ""support the troops,"" the book green-lit and fast-tracked is the one that disparages those that serve. Swofford claims ""Jarhead"" is only his story. Other than the parts he made up, he is right. More than that, it is a story of someone that belonged either in the brig or on the mental ward.The movie itself is a vast improvement over the original material. The time constraints of the movie forced the producers to scrap most of Swofford's life in the Corps. What results is a seldom seen story of the Persian Gulf War. The biggest enemy faced down by the Marines in Jarhead is boredom.Director Sam Mendes' previous films, the liberal orgy American Beauty and the stylistic Road to Perdition, had the look of an accomplished director. Jarhead at times takes the viewer closer than any CNN embed ever could, and a few times the dichotomy of keeping with the mission and the drudgery of an infantryman's life are as authentic as any image put on the screen.If you are hoping an action filled war movie, Jarhead is the opposite. A few rounds of incoming fire and a friendly-fire strafing run by an A-10 are about all you are going to get. To be true to the individual in a war is to show the lack of actual combat. To be true to the honor of those that serve is to see this movie for what it is: seconds of fright surrounded by days (or in this case, months) of waiting. If Jarhead has one downfall it is filming boredom in an entertaining way.The bureaucracy and the selfishness in the way we fight war are no clearer illustrated than when Swofford, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, finally has an Iraqi in his sights but is told to hold his fire because a major believes he may give away the surprise of pending air strike. After years of training, months of waiting, finally, he has a chance to do his job, but the major that denies him pulls up a lawn chair to watch the fireworks.Jamie Foxx (SSGT Sykes) leads the film along with a purpose just as his character leads his unit towards its ultimate goal, which is a plane ride home. The make up of the rest of the cast is complete in the color-in-the-blanks way many war movies go about casting. You have the redneck, the mentally challenged guy, the philosopher, and the barracks lawyer.In the end, the real Tony Swofford was able to parlay his experiences into a book and movie earning him more money than many make over a lifetime. Maybe things work out for people like Swofford in that way. About two weeks after my roommate Watters lost his ruck, he was smoking outside our unit's hangar when a saw a PFC walk by with his ruck over his shoulder. I was disappointed at his serendipity. However, you do not have to call yourself Earl to understand Karma. A few months later when we deployed to Turkey, Watters got drunk and slashed the bike tires of the Air Force personnel in the tent next to him. The command promptly demoted him and barred him from reenlisting.As thousands of Marines fight and die in the Global War on Terror I know someone in Hollywood could read about Watters and say, ""I can see a movie in that story."" Meanwhile, the true heroes do their jobs, largely unseen, and largely unappreciated.http://www.geocities.com/pageiv71/jarhead.html",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
In the desert,"This movie is about fear. About men and war, and about how far can you go, how far you push the limit when you are in a prison without walls: the desert.

This is a movie that has a structure, finally i can say that there's a movie with some backbone. Where other movies try to achieve the thrills, this movie lets you thrilled. Where other movies try to come as art movies, this movie makes cinematographic art in a very concise and brilliant way (yes, Swoff's girlfriend&sand dream, the horse sequence, etc.). It has rhythm, tone, it has the tempo, and above all, dares to have its way. It dares to experiment and to refuse clichés, and to be witty and bold.

Then he gets handpicked by a staff sergeant to be a scout sniper. In the training he learns that he is actually a good sniper and gets hooked and loves it. He is then left to be bored and do all sorts of interesting rituals and craziness ensues with his fellow marines to pass the time. The acting is superb by Jake Gyllenhaal and the directing and cinematography is subtle yet moving and effective.In a large part the movie is sitting around and waiting, wondering what their girlfriends are doing and being paranoid that they are getting screwed by someone else.

"JARHEAD...Powerful, Unforgettable SEMPER FI...","Sam Mendes has delivered a film that really hits home today with the present situation in Iraq and the glimpse into the world of hell which makes a ""Marine, a Marine"" and provides the audience with a visual story of a young Marine, Jake Gyllenhaal, and his journey through boot camp to the reality of war.Jamie Foxx is simply brilliant and his Marine Sargent propels the story forward and combines not only strength of command, but a sense of what it takes to be a Marine. And Peter Sarsgaard delivers a compelling performance of a troubled Marine who wants to succeed in the Corps more than anything despite his past.The scenes in the battlefield, the oil fires and the reality of war hitting home on the young Marines faces made an impression on me and the audience at The Grove in Los Angeles, and I thought immediately of our current Marines and what they face today in the ""second"" war in Iraq.Jake Gyllenhaal grows into a strong young man and fights his own devils in his role as JARHEAD comes to its sad conclusion, and Jake's Marine represents what it must be like to be a Marine, never forgetting for one moment ""The Corps"" and the values and comradeship made as a Marine which stays with you for life in the meaning of SEMPER FI.JARHEAD is an important American story and film and kudos to Sam Mendes for his direction of this chapter of Marine history.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Blown WAY out of proportion,"With the exception of bootcamp, the first few minutes of the movie, the rest was ridiculously blown out of proportion. The disgruntled Marine, if he was a Marine, has made noncom's appear to be nothing but airheads rather than the fighting machines with conscience that they are. Officers do not act the way the Lt Col acted. Most of the Marines do not act as they are depicted.Marines are proud, yes. They are confident, yes. More importantly, they know how to act in public. As opposed to other branches, Marines are held to a higher standard even in public while off duty.If you are an ex-Marine, you might like this movie. But most everyone knows there is no such thing as an ex-Marine. Those who are no longer active but still consider them brothers in the Marines, you will most likely NOT like this movie.SEMPER FI!",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Nice insight,"My boyfriend being a Marine that just recently served in Iraq & Afghanistan has told me many stories. We went to see this movie and many times during the movies he would let out a little giggle because that's how things are. The movie may not show as much about war as some of the viewers would like. I believe it brought insight to all of the Americans that wonder what happens behind the scenes. What goes through these Marines heads when they are going through boot camp or when they are in the desert..what do they do to pass time? If your going to watch a flick with a bunch of blowing up and people being shot then stay home and watch Saving Private Ryan.

wow,"This film was awesome, i thoroughly enjoyed this take on the gulf war. I think all of the actors played their roles superbly and award winning Jamie Foxx played his convincing strict commanding officer perfectly. It was refreshing to see a war film not actually based on the battle, but on the mental struggle these marine officers had to go through day and night and not actually being able to see any of the action or use any of the skills they have learnt from their intense training. On the comic side of the film it offers the audience some cleverly put together one liners which will have you in stitches! A beautifully scripted masterpiece well done to the team of creators who took part in this! I recommend this film to anyone who likes a mix of genres all rolled into one film, this is an action, comedy and drama all rolled into one, go out and watch it!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A fresh look at things! something new for the War film genre! i really enjoyed!,"I would happily recommend this movie, but something i would say is, if your looking for a war movie with all out action like saving private Ryan or something you are looking at the wrong type of film, this is in fact a completely fresh look at things. The heartache and pain of going to war, risking your life, and you weren't even needed anyway. They go through the heartache of training, risking their lives, and don't get to play the part, they had always trained for, dreamt of, and wanted to. This film also provides a look at what keeps the soldiers motivated and what could happen if their motivation is taken from them, it leaves them lonely and out of their mind, when they need to try and defend their country. It also shows the bounds between soldiers, and some of the after affects, and provides you with new thoughts, opinions, and answers. And also you might learn new things about what goes on, that you didn't know.With a fresh all out talented cast, that we all need to see more of, you can see a lot of fresh faces for a lot of future movie roles, with actors to take over for the new generation of movie making! This film took a whole new look at things with a 21st century edge of movie-making, direction, and filming with an excellent soundtrack.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
What a disappointment!,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. What a total disappointment it turned out to me. It lacked depth, was boring, totally crude and at times bordered on pornographic. It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was not entertaining nor educational or had any true message (except if you choose to fight for your country, your wife or girlfriend will cheat with the first guy she comes across after your gone) so I really am at a loss at to what it was supposed to provide to the viewer....too bad the superb actors in this movie wasted their talents on this garbage.

"Well, yes.....","Alright, I have never been in an armed service and never plan to be. I thought I should say that before I started.To the people who thought that this movie had no plot or conclusion I say to you: NO, REALLY? This movie struck me as essentially a first person documentary, and a truly good documentary should simply present ""How it is"" and not make any value statements. That is this movie to a ""t"" in my mind. It simply presented everything that the writer (a marine) felt or experienced (or heard about one would guess from the sheer scope of it all). Essentially, the viewer is overloaded with everything; Swofford seems to try to dump this part of his life into you brain, and I think did an excellent job. When I left the theatre I essentially felt, OK yes... The meaning of this film is what you make it.As to the accuracy of the events and portrayal, i cannot say. However I found it interesting that there seem to be many marines who have responded and seem to be evenly split as to the accuracy (what does this imply). I would, however, like to say for what it is worth that the characters in the movie are simply portrayed as human. They all have failings, weaknesses, and simply fly off the handle occasionally. If this in some way besmirches the ""infallible hero"" image of a marine GOOD. I am sorry if that remark cause offense, but sad to say that you are still human. Marines may have a tough job, i'll certainly grant them that, but if that is to imply that everyone is to ignore the fact that they are just as human as the next person, I believe that to be a worse disfavour.Well, overall, this was an excellent movie. Odd as it may sound, it was a war movie that achieved greatness through understatement (one may not believe it to be possible).As to others comments: I found it funny the people essentially whining about the language and sex. Umm, you send people out to die and you think they are going to worry about profanity? There was so little war, others complained.... that was desert storm, what did you expect about a movie about Desert Storm? And the worse ones: Oh no, your questioning the impeccable facade of the armed services... your Un-American. Folks, we buried Mcarthy along time ago, true his legacy has never died, but really: America = freedom = allowed to say anything you want.

Not what i expected...,"I saw a trailer for this film a few weeks ago and was really unimpressed by it. Once I realised it was directed by Mendes, and that Deakins was the cinematographer I decided it'd be worth a watch As I took my seat i was half expecting a typical, unrealistic, pro-American 'war' film that would just try to justify America's current political position (albeit with some decent cinematography). Needless to say, what i actually got was something different. The film focuses on what it is to be a modern soldier, rather than the actual details of the Gulf War. Any major plot points are centred around the Marines and the way they interact with each other, and/or react to the situation they are in. The pace of the film is almost spot-on, and the performances of all the lead actors help give depth to the characters without it seeming forced.I thought this film was brilliantly paced, and the cloying, claustrophobic tension was built to a climax excellently. Stand out performances came from Gyllenhaal and Foxx (an actor i'm usually unimpressed by), top this with some excellent cinematography, to give a film well worth watching.Worth a watch, a different kind of war film...",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Empty and obnoxious,"I sincerely hope marines don't act like this in real life. I already had no interest in joining the military and this movie doesn't wanna make me change my mind lol. It stars Jake Gylanhaal, Jamie Foxx, Lucas Black, and Peter Sarsgaard. These men are good actors and I'm surprised they chose to do this bland empty film. The script doesn't provide any kind of meat or interesting dialogue to enjoy. It's just obnoxious typical ""male banter"", and I hate that lol, can't the writers be a little more creative?? It's not the constant cursing I mind, that doesn't bother me in the least, it's the boring often times offensive comments made by these degenerate soldiers. They are crotch grabbing, sex obsessed, derogatory comment slinging annoying men. I don't mind sex talk between characters, but this movie was so anti-gay in its language and the men talked about women in a very objective way. And when they aren't behaving like complete idiots, they are trigger happy and talking about wanting to kill, it seems they actually want war and killing, which is disturbing. I respect military men and women and thank them for what they endure to serve our nation but I sincerely hope they don't behave like this. They're like baboons lol. 1/10 for Jarhead. Doesn't keep your attention at all, just a bland and empty film.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very aggressive and truthful war film.,"Jarhead is far harder to watch than the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down - instead of being a gory war flick like these two, it instead revolves around the times when soldiers don't fight - they wait for battle, and get to know each other. This film never passed on the bad language - it used the f-word about 250 times. This film definitely put me off joining the army - though some of it is exaggerated, it sums it all up really - the types who are sent to the army are literally sent there - they never do it out of their own will. They are there because they are bad men. The film is rough, rude, and crude in parts (it didn't need to be crude, though the film is based a lot on the Marines missing and showing off their girlfriends), but it gives a stronger message then Black Hawk Down, and shows the immense struggles, physical and emotional pains, and extreme climates that recruits have to go through before their battles. Everybody must see this film - it is a film that shows the opposite side of war that Black Hawk Down shows - the times when recruits actually wish they were fighting. A must see. This film is only let down by the fact that there isn't a great deal of character in it, but other than that, it is riveting. A spiffing job! 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Different, realistic and superb war drama","Anthony Swofford joins the US Marines and is specialises as an infantry sniper. Within a few short years he and his unit are in Saudi Arabia, engaging in Operation Desert Shield and preparing for Operation Desert Storm. He and his comrades are eager for action and glory but, despite a war being fought, fighting seems to elude them.Based on Anthony Swofford's book ""Jarhead"", account of his life in the Marines, and directed by Sam Mendes, whose previous two films were the brilliant ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"" and whose next film would be the superb ""Revolutionary Road"", Jarhead is hardly your conventional war movie. There's hardly any fighting, though we do sometimes see the grim results of war.The film is centred on Swofford and his platoon and demonstrates that most of being in the military is just sitting around, doing menial tasks or finding ways to amuse yourself. This might sound like a premise for a dull movie but it is far from that. We get to see what makes the men tick, their state of mind, the inane stuff they have to deal with. It's all very interesting and very funny as we are presented with some great banter and comedic scenarios.It's also very engaging as we get to know the men and experience their camaraderie.All this is driven by some great performances: Jake Gyllenhaal as Swofford, Jamie Foxx as Staff Sergeant Sykes, Lucas Black, Peter Sarsgaard.

It gave the movie a sense of the pain that must exist in the men of special forces. I would say that the movie plot is like an ""adult film"" that doesn't have a climax and everyone is upset for that fact. Jake and the supporting cast needed their kill. They didn't get it. The kill seemed to be the return home scene with the Vet on the bus. It was a little over the top, as well as his ex-girlfriend. I will buy it on DVD when it comes out.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beautifully shot film with an edge of sympathy that isn't usually evident in this genre.,"In this film we follow the lives of a marine corps of snipers through their training to their action (or what turns out to be very little action) in the 'Desert Storm' war in Iraq in the early 1990s. I had read a few reviews of this film before seeing it and I have to say that I disagree with any calling it 'flat', 'slow' or 'boring'. If you are a film watcher that cannot concentrate for very long and just want to see a film with impressive skirmish scenes, this is not the film for you. However, Sam Mendes has created a film with some very impressive cinematography that paradoxes beautifully against the tedium the soldiers feel in their wait for their crack at some action.The other reviewer for this film talks of how refreshed he felt seeing a film in this genre that captures the essence of war without engaging in the politics behind it. I however do not agree with this statement. The whole film is brimming with political and humanitarian satire. The breakdown of many of the soldier's relationships with wives and girlfriends during their extended stay away ""serving their country"" is dealt with with remarkable tenderness as it battles the sky high testosterone levels and egos as would be imagined in such a military environment.What I believe to be the finest scene of the film pictures the soldiers being rained on from the black skies of tar due to the oil wells being a blaze in every direction, digging their 'sleeping holes', as a helicopter flies over their heads playing The Doors' 'Break on Through to the Other Side' over a loudspeaker. Jake Gyllenhaal's character looks over to his friends, dejected after months of inactivity, and remarks ""This music isn't even for our war"". Having come from a family with a Vietnam vet for a father, a theme that reappears with this main character throughout the film is that the war isn't one he should be involved in as an young American man.The question that this film raises, in common with other films of its genre, is... ""Is it all worth it?"". With the final scene showing us Jake Gyllenhaal's character coming home to his life as a normal citizen, to a girlfriend that he learns has left him and found another guy, we're really left with the feeling that no, it wasn't worth it at all.A great film with a deeply satirical view on a soldiers life, ambition, and ultimately their use weighed up against how much they sacrifice in order to 'serve their country'.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Marine Corps is Evil! Just ask Sam Mendes...,"I work in show business on a popular network television show. I graduated from Marine Officer Candidate School in 2001. My best friend recently finished his service in the USMC. My father fought in World War II as a Marine. The Marine Corps is an often regaled, highly respected institution in this country for good cause. However, if my only experience with the Corps was through this movie-- as it will be for countless thousands of people in countries across Europe, the Middle East and Asia-- my sympathy for the terrorists in Iraq and around the world would swell. This is a propaganda film, pure and simple. Jarhead adopts a point of view based on the failure of one Marine and applies it universally to the entire organization. I have experienced the military for myself and the idiocy of the actions undertaken by the Marines from the protagonist's point of view are at best extreme exaggerations and at worst outright lies. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays PFC Tony Swofford, author of the book upon which Jarhead is based. The Marine Corps that ""Swoff"" is a part of is so vilified that his own outlandish reactions to stress seem mere trifles in comparison. But the truth of the matter is that PFC Swofford was clearly not a remarkable Marine. In fact, he was wholly unremarkable. And with a penchant for writing and a few well connected friends, Anthony Swofford's inferiority inspired a 65 million dollar propaganda movie that has the potential to tarnish the wartime reputation of our troops based on a series of mistruths and exaggerations. Swofford was a screw-up-- a trait that is celebrated in this movie when it should be chided. Jarhead hearkens back to the propaganda of World War II, where the Japanese were depicted as inhuman monsters on our posters and Charlie Chaplin bumbled around the screen as the Great Dicatator. The difference of course is that our Marines are the inhuman monsters and instead of Charlie Chaplin presenting a caricature of Hitler, Chris Cooper fills in with a Marine Lieutenant Colonel. Dissenting should be encouraged; and God bless those with the courage to lobby for policy with honesty and integrity. A line of morality is crossed, however, when the Sam Mendes'and the Michael Moore's of society use their influence and wealth to influence millions of people across the world by presenting fiction as fact. This movie is insulting, shameful and enraging. Its November release suggests it will be vying for Oscar nominations. It will damage the image of our troops, it will encourage acts of terrorism against them and any accolades it receives will only validate such damages. If you choose to see this movie, I strongly encourage you to find a Marine and talk to them about the Corps afterward. I also encourage a fiscal boycott of the film; if you are able to attend free or advanced screenings, then power to you. However, if you pay ten dollars to see it, whether you love or hate it, the film's profit margin will increase and the people responsible for the dishonest portrayal within will continue to make copious amounts of money for propagation of untruths.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Distant From the War,"In 1989, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, the USA sent countless troops to Middle East deserts to combat Saddam Hussein army. ""Jarhead"" is based on a book written by one Marine, who joined this force due to lack of professional options, since he was not able to go to college. This movie shows the Marine Corp trained by stupid and sadistic leaders, and the troop completely alienated, in a war without seeing the enemy, or knows the country or the costumes of the locals, and even the reasons for their action, being trained like pawns, aiming to kill an enemy. I do not know the reality of the Marines, but the way the story is presented it is not compatible with the worldwide image they have, mostly due to Hollywood movies. I was a little disappointed with director Sam Mendes, after ""American Beauty"" (1999) and ""Road to Perdition"" (2002). With the usual interval of three years to make a movie, he should have selected a better screenplay. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Soldado Anônimo"" (""Anonymous Soldier"")",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

"a truly revolutionary war film, one of the greatest of the last 25 years","despite the views of many people who saw this movie it has absolutely nothing to do w/ the military, government, or soldiers, this movie is an insight into the mind of one man Anthony Swofford. As a kid who skips college and joins the Marines, ""Swoff"" eventually works his way into an elite unit possibly the worlds most elite assassins, marine snipers. The movie shows you the mind of a man who trains for years to be a stone cold killer, to be able to look his target right in the face as if standing 2 feet in front of him and pull the trigger that ends their life. This movie isn't about killing people (so if your looking for a war movie with great battle scenes don't bother), it is about what happens to a man like swoff and the others of his unit, whoso sole purpose in war is to kill people, when spending years of their lives training to kill and never being put to use, then when their one chance comes to use their abilities it is taken away at the last moment. there are many who are saying that this movie is a politic/soldier/military bashing film yet at no point does the main character state anything against bush nor does he not support the war he was apart of, in fact he was thrilled to be there and only longed to do his duties. the fact is that this movie is about the mind of a marine sniper, specifically swoff. it is a great war film, possibly one of the better of all time and is acted to perfection by jake gyllenhall, peter saarssgard, jamie foxx, and others. it definitely deserves praise from all the members of our military and i expect to see it quite a few times when the Oscar nominations roll out not to long from now.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Not Your Typical War Movie,"I went to see Jarhead on Friday afternoon after reading the recent Harper's magazine profile essay on the film and the problems associated with anti-war films. I first became familiar with Swofford's memoirs about his service in the first Iraq War primarily because of Swofford's legendary party-session with University of Kentucky grad-students after a Lexington reading.The setting: Melissa and I showed up at the 3:20 pm showing at the Regal theater (a typical shopping area multiplex). Arriving somewhat early, there were only two other people in the screening area and I thought that this might be a typical early-Friday screening (the last afternoon showing we had experienced was The Constant Gardener which had only six people in the audience).Slowly groups of 2-4 people filed into the theater until there was about 20+ people. At about 10 minutes before the showing three groups of 12+ people showed up, obviously, from overheard conversation and their collective-huddling, they were the local fraternities come to check out the latest war film.The audience was easily 90% male and, as Melissa noted, the testosterone blanketed the theater. One could sense that they were there for some action and some butt-kicking. In my imagination I heard them rallying the guys to go see the film: ""Enough of the daily reports of violence and death in the current Iraq-war, lets go see a film about the one where we kicked some serious ass!"" The film (general comments because I don't want to ruin the plot): This film is going to produce extreme reactions. It will be one of those polarizing films that will be an ideological litmus-test of the people who watch it (like Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing) because it doesn't make an explicit stand either way on this war, or war in general. It simply presents Swofford's personal story of training to be a Marine scout and his experiences in the first Gulf War.A lot of commentary I have seen is that this film (and Swofford's book) is anti-military. I don't see it... yes it exposes the cruelties of collective male-bonding that is centered around the hatred of an ""enemy-other,"" but is that really shocking to anyone? It portrays the insanity and dehumanization of contemporary warfare in which buttons are pushed and hundreds of people are immediately incinerated/blown-up, but is this unrealistic? It depicts the trauma experienced by those who serve in the military, but one only has to read studies of post-traumatic syndrome all the way back to WWI to realize this reality.What I think is disturbing about this film for many of the people attacking it is that it de-mythologizes the glorification of personal combat--the individualistic hero-figure who rises above even the screwed-up absurdity of the military situation, bringing order to the madness. In this film there are no heroes. Even Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, perceived as anti-war films, allow us points of identification and characters we can ""root"" for in their quest to make sense of the insanity of war. In Jarhead, there are no places we can rest, we are kept disturbed, we are uneasy, we really don't know what is going on, perhaps the military terminology best suited to the atmosphere of the film is FUBAR.The audience after the movie: As we walked out you could sense the frustration of the bands of fraternity-boys who had sought the glories of represented warfare. They complained loudly that the film lacked the spectacle they had come to experience. I wondered, how many of these boys, from their fraternity-association and position of privilege in our society, would ever have to worry about serving in the military. Why, if they were so lucky to escape this service, unlike their less-fortunate peers in Iraq, Afghanistan and other parts of the world, was it so necessary for them to feel a part of the rituals of war, even if it was through the spectacle of a Hollywood film. As we walked out many of them were on phones planning the night's parties, their frustration so evident, I wondered how it would manifest in the night to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the Best War movies of the Decade,"Every war has it's films and one always stands out. Saving Private Ryan was the best WWII movie, Dr. Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb was the best Cold War movie, Apocalypse Now was the best Vietnam War movie and I think Jarhead may be the best Gulf War movie.A good list of actors who I don't know but am aware of stared in this movie , but Jamie Foxx was the only actor who I've watched another film starring him. And I saw Evan Jones in 8 Mile. very passionate acting made the experience more realistic and made it a better film.The cinematography was absolutely brilliant. The filming of the scorching dessert was amazing although it wasn't even filmed in the middle east. The way it's filmed makes me feel uncomfortable watching the soldiers in that flaming dessert, but that is just good production values.It was based on the 2003 book by former marine Anthony Swafford, and what an experience that poor guy had but he was still cool enough with his book being made into a motion picture.I like this film, although it's about a terrible war happening in the 80s, there was a nice vibe. You know all the comedy and comical moments which happened. This is one of my favourites and always will be and to be honest It deserves a better rating than 7.0/10.Overall great movie based on the experiences of a ex-marine, good screenplay and great acting. I must say that this film is not for people who are weak hearted because there is a lot of strong war imagery which I know a lot of people are quite sensitive about. But still funny, sexy and spreads a message about not only the gulf war, but all war. And that message is: Every man fights his own war and he can make that war out to be what ever he wants it to be.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Perhaps it helps to remember...,"that ""Jarhead"" is based on a book written from one man's point of view after serving as a Marine. I suspect that the movie (and book) say more about Swofford's personality and what was meaningful to him during his service than what the Marines are actually about. I have not served in the military myself, though many friends and acquaintances have. They confirm many of the factual aspects of the film, but demonstrate a completely different understanding and perspective of the experience.Does military service include long periods of boredom? Sure. But just think, for example, of the number of troops in WWII who spent literally years away from home, with only written correspondence to connect them to friends and loved ones. Many of those NEVER saw combat and (quite frankly) may have had little or no effect on the outcome of the conflict. Not all Marines (perhaps not even a large portion) ever fire their weapons in anger at an enemy.Ultimately, my impression is that Swofford has the type of selective memory common to many college students, who seem to remember the drunken parties, the sex, and the fraternity hazings best. Other students remember the more valuable aspects of the college experience, especially when they appreciated the opportunities at the time they attended college. I suspect that Swofford is accurate and factual in most of what he describes, but it does not paint a complete picture of the Marine experience anymore than a John Wayne film does.OK, back to the film. It's also boring as hell and should never have been made by Mendes. There is no need to watch it.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Welcome To The Suck.""","Amazing performances in this modern war movie especially from Jake Gyllenhaal who embodies (real life) marine Anthony Swofford, following him through boot camp to his assignment as an elite sniper during Operation Desert Storm. For the most part what this movie portrays is the ultimate boredom, frustration and psychological challenges these soldiers faced, waiting for their moment to ""see the pink mist."" There are some funny scenes here, some we've seen many times before (boot camp) but the strong cast (Jamie Foxx and Wow that ""take the shot"" scene in the bunker with Peter Sarsgaard) really give us some amazing performances.This is also an absolutely gorgeous movie, I mean the cinematography is breathtaking, sometimes seen through a faulty gas mask or a game of desert football, with flaming oil fields in the night sky, black rain and an oil drenched, drowning horse. Haunting. as was the ending when we see the guys several years later. 9/29/14",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great movie, must see for anyone joining the service!","This is a great movie. It was really good to see a new war movie that did a good job on covering what life is like in the US marine corp. It covered a good point of view of desert shield and desert storm. It was not what I expected from watching the previews, however it was on target. This movie also briefly covers a lot of things people go through when they join the service. The acting was good. The movie itself was never boring. Jarhead covers a lot of things that go on in the us military in just a short time (better than I could in a short speech). If I wanted to share with someone what life was like as a US veteran with someone, I would sit down and watch this movie with them.

Not your standard war film.,"There is so much going on in this film, it's often intense, but somehow never overwhelming. Everything feels dark and full of scepticism; and even at times, might be in the protagonist's head: a blur of reality and illusion. Speaking of which, the likes of Mendes, Deakins and Gyllenhaal, masterfully blur the lines of morality and question what righteousness truly is within the themes addressed - and by the final scene, you can't tell what is good or bad. It's devastating, propelled by fantastic filmmaking.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Anti-Climatic War-Movie,"Sam Mendes third feature JARHEAD is full of everything in war we usually don't see, and that's interesting - we've seen inner-conflicts, we've seen the acid, we've seen the molesting and all that stuff before, JARHEAD goes its own way and with Sam Mendes on directional duties it oughta be great! Well, it isn't.Jake Gyllenhaal stars and looks just as bewildered and frustrated as any American boy fed on Apocalypse Now oughta be, and Gyllenhaal doesn't become the star of the show, instead he becomes one of the many, frustrated young men who came to the Desert Storm not really knowing what was going on, who had imagined something that really never existed. It's Jamie Foxx as Staff Sgt. Sykes that truly shines, he is a developed piece of armory that brings more to this than the usual complexity of serving a country you don't know what stands for.There's dusty production design in this, and the movie feels frustratingly difficult to enjoy before half way through, that's when Roger Deakins really steps in. The cinematography of JARHEAD is truly memorable, oil-shining and gas-fueled this feels like a meltdown of drained emotions towards a coda of questions not answered. It really could have become something terrifying and provocative. Sadly, the tacky screenplay with Gyllenhaal doing even tackier voice-over grabs the movie by it horns and slows down something that could have ended much better than it began.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Its raining, raining oil","i bought my ticket for jar-head with reservations. would i really believe that Donnie Darko could pull off the mentality of a marine sniper, one of the toughest and nastiest professions on earth second only to lion circumciser. Sam Mendes does it again. plain and simple this is a war movie that is not akin to any made today. the dialogue is as sharp as the bayonet they carry into battle. the action scenes are as good as black hawk down, and the character/actor resemblance is disgustingly amazing. Ray Charles can be a marine drill Sargent. Donnie Darko is a mentally torn apart sniper. the pure emotion that this film evokes is second only to Saving Private Ryan's first twenty minutes or the bathroom scene in full metal jacket. i gave this movie an 8 out of 10, but it was so close to a 9. it lost points in my book only twice, the startling resembles to FMJ in some of the opening scenes, and the male shower scene which is because i didn't see it coming and my homophobia was not ready for it. this movie is spectacular and will open your eyes to why we always must support our troops and malign the politicians who place the burden of freedom on the body bags of the willing.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The film drags quite badly. There is no story- this would be OK if there was plenty of character development, but this is also notable by it's absence.For a film that has been compared to Full Metal Jacket and Buffalo Soldiers, this film is very disappointing.Jamie Foxx stole his scenes, but that's not saying much.Maybe it was trying to say that the desolation of the ubiquitous war-torn landscape reflects the soul of modern America.

"Imagery was outstanding, Statement was there!","I went into this movie reading about how it wasn't the typical war movie; about how all the big ""boom"" scenes weren't present. Knowing that, and knowing the aesthetics of Sam Mendes, and the incredible talent of Gyllenhaal, Foxx and Sarsgaard, I went to this movie with mixed expectations, but high hopes. It definitely exceeded all my expectations, and I can't wait for the DVD!As I watched, I saw, not a war movie, but a character study of these men...boys actually...thrown into a war they didn't know much about. It was an honest movie, I think, and it was BEAUTIFULLY filmed. I was sucked in and taken on a ride that wasn't about ""action"" or ""suspense""...it was about these few moments between the waiting, between the boredom. The crux of the movie (I won't say what because I don't want to spoil anything) moved me so much, because my heart ached for them. (That's the scene that convinced me that Peter Sarsgaard is the next big thing...next to Jake Gyllenhaal, of course!)There's no hidden agenda in the film...there's no political stance. People are saying there's no plot. I beg to differ. I see a movie about the despair that they all felt when their war ended before it ever started. There WAS no plot in their lives in those few months. Their time in the desert was like a wheel that was spinning and not going anywhere. I felt the movie captured that to a tee.Two thumbs up from me! :) Jenn",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The madness of war...without war.,"It's amazing. This movie does perfectly show the whole madness of war...only without the war elements. No fighting, action or shooting is present here. Only a couple of well trained and motivated U.S. Marines who are getting more and more bored and fed-up and slowly start loosing their minds in the deserts in the Middle East, during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. The movie does a very good job at creating and making this sort of madness believable and sensible in the movie.Just imaging being trained hard for months for something extreme that takes lots of expertise and skill and eventually getting deployed for fulfilling these tasks but in the end being never able to show and use these skills and expertise you trained so hard for, for so long under often extreme conditions. Waiting and preparing for something that never comes. Wouldn't you slowly start loosing your mind and be annoyed and bored at least? This is exactly what the story of ""Jarhead"" is about. Drinking water, moving over a hill, drinking water again and then some more, all over again without ever fighting or encountering an enemy. It all feels so pointless and it's a killer for the motivation. The Marines in ""Jarhead"" all slowly start to see the pointlessness and irrelevance of their mission and they abandon all hope that they well ever get to use their skills and their hard training. So they start concentrating more and more on different more trivial issues and 'crazy' pastimes.This movie shows that people are people. Nothing in this movie is story is black or white. Its realistic and therefor the events and the characters of the movie become sensible and also understandable.The movie is not an heavy drama. At least not as heavy as you might expect after reading this movie its plot line. The movie is told quite lighthearted and fast paced. Therefor it manages to become an entertaining movie to watch, despite its heavy and serious theme. If you have already seen the other Sam Mendes movie ""American Beauty"", you already know what sort of dark, realistic, subtle and unusual sort of humor you could expect.After browsing around a little I find out that most of the people who didn't liked or even hated the movie had problems with the portrayal of the U.S. marines in the movie. They were offended and call it unrealistic and not fair toward the Marine Corps. However when you ask a random U.S. Marine, who was active in the first Gulf war around the same time period this movie is set in, he will tell you that this movie is fairly accurate and most of the Marines really behaved the way as presented in this movie. Even some Veterans active here on IMDb who expressed their opinions and feelings about this movie, confirm this. Doing a bit of research before commenting and expressing your hatred or your opinion in general about a movie, is never a bad idea. Just a friendly little word of advice toward a couple of fellow movie-critics here.The movie is absolutely beautifully crafted. Sam Mendes style of directing is detailed with eye for realism, credibility and entertainment as well. He tells the story with lots of style as well. Just also look at the amazingly wonderful cinematography by Roger Deakins and the nimble editing by Walter Murch.The acting is great although most of the actors are too old for their roles. Most of the Marines are supposed to be around 18-20 years old but most of the actors that portray them are above the 25 or older. Jake Gyllenhaal fits the main part well and delivers a good performance. Jamie Foxx was yet again brilliant and he at least deserved an Oscar nod. Also great was Chris Cooper in a small, perhaps even cameo-sized role.An impressive, though provoking movie about an interesting and relevant subject, that yet, is also entertaining to watch.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I think you need to watch it again........................,"Many viewers and critics fail to see the potential for what this movie has. From the adaption of Anthony Swofford's memoir, Jarhead reveals itself as a story of self-becoming through the eyes of a 20-year old Marine CORPS scout sniper.From the first watch, one can say that this story is mainly about nothing. This is not a war flick, yet the irony of it all is that, it is. What I mean by this statement of 'another war movie,' is in the aspect of it sharing the same emotions of any type of war; killing and the fear of being killed. Jarhead levels itself on a more emotional level rather than on a physical killing mode level. We peer through Swoff's emotion as we see him go through the most awkward phases of ignorance, sense of belonging, and insanity.I enjoyed this movie because it has many elements revolved around the self and the idea of the CORPS functioning as a family. Although I may add that this movie is a little slow to start, it counteracts with its dark humor and silly antics of Marine CORPS boredom. I believe that this movie is a good account of what war is capable of doing with or without physical combat. This movie shows the human side of soldiers in their natural state, whether alert, depressed, happy, sexually frustrated, angry, or insane. All of this shows the intensification of each character and their personality throughout the movie. It shows that people who join the army are not killers, murderers, and people who just fight to serve their country. But that they are HUMAN, and go through human emotions.Just as Swoff said, ""every war is different, every war is the same,"" we fight each war differently, mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Yet every thing that is expressed in war, mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually...is universal.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"unrelenting, vulgar, and therefore fantastic","Jarhead is a movie with great images but a lack of unity. The story tries to right itself with narration, but it still comes off as random in the end. Even so, the movie is stellar due to its unrelenting realism. If you ask, is the film more drama or action, it is most definitely drama, but the drama is simply through recklessness. The movie is very vulgar, and it fits thematically. Among an endless stream of explosions, burning corpses, incessant f-bombs, and male nudity, the film highlights the depravity of war and the insanity created in those fighting it. The acting in the film is fantastic, though there are some scenes taken right out of Apocalypse Now and Platoon. The movie is set to a popular music soundtrack, and it doesn't do much for the film. There are also some unneeded doses of fantasy. The film has flaws for the nit-picky, but its no-holds-barred attitude will endear it to most everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Good movie,"OK, I finally got to see Jarhead. I've been waiting sometime to see this film. I'm a big fan of Sam Mendes, having love both American Beauty and Road to Perdition. I also like war movies as well, my favorites being Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, and Black Hawk Down. Upon seeing the trailer, a friend of mine noted that this looked like ""Platoon, only in Desert Storm"". Sure enough, it did. So, color me surprised when I read an Entertainment Weekly article which said, ""A War movie with no combat, mostly waiting."" I thought What? What kind of movie is that? Still, I went anyways, thinking it might at least be kinda good. Sure, this movie takes its time getting to its point, but it helps to put you in the mindset of the Marines. BTW, I've been reading some of the posts on here about this movie having no politics, and being anti-American. This is stupid, obviously these people did not understand the film. The point was, at least to my understanding, that you have to sacrifice yourself, who you are, to become a killer for the Marines. You hope you do it for a good reason, to protect your country. The guy here, however, ultimately thought he sacrificed everything and got nothing. This is not anti-Amercian. Maybe an unflattering look at Marines, but this guy still loved his country and wanted to serve it, but was never given a chance. There also seemed to be a slight commentary on the ridiculousness of war, but it wasn't a main focus. This is a great film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Harrowing and bold look at the life of a Marine,"Sam Mendes, director of American Beauty (1999), takes a step into the war genre with this Gulf War-set war movie, based on the autobiography by Anthony Swafford. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swafford, a young man from Sacremento, who enlist in the U.S Marine Corps in the late 1980s. Surviving through boot camp under the ruthless Drill Sergeant Sykes (played by Jamie Foxx), Swafford makes it out as a sniper, and he and his unit are stationed in Saudi Arabia. With the 1991 Persian Gulf War erupting, Swafford and the unit are plagued with personal issues such as homesickness, humiliation, abuse, frustration, and fear of girlfriends' infidelity. This is until Operation Desert Storm breaks out and the unit find their chance to finally get the taste of what war is really all about. As explained in the movie, Jarhead is the slang term for a Marine.Jarhead is not quite your typical war movie, this war is more of a comedy than an combat action-heavy film. Many war movie fans may be disappointed as this movie revolves more on how war affects the main character as well as his fellow marines than soldiers engaging in violent, bloodshed combat, with very few scenes of actual combat on screen. I was a little disappointed in some ways. Unlike most war films, the plot in this one focuses on what soldiers do when they're not in active combat. While the plot is okay, it could have been better written. There are various points in the film where the plot seems to stumble. For the most of the first half, we are treated with scenes of Marines sharing conversation about their sexual experiences, watching pornographic videos, pulling pranks on each others, comparing girls, sneaking booze and throwing wild parties. It very realistically portrays the daily lives of Marines off the battlefield. Jake Gyllenhaal's character is develops so well throughout the film, and you see as how the war begins to change him. The scene when has a mental breakdown towards one of his fellow marines gives a clear demonstration of how war begins consuming him. Gyllenhaal's performance was good, and Jamie Foxx did alright as well. I can't say their performances are Oscar-worthy though. One major flaw with this film is that it lacks emotional investment, and so while the characters' emotions are evident, they don't feel real or engaging.Overall, Jarhead is not bad movie. Yes, it has its ups and downs here and there. However, it is certainly not one I would recommendable to everyone. Maybe those who are big Jake Gyllenhaal's fans would be the best people to recommend to.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Cost of Fetishing Vietnam,"On the surface, there is little to distinguish 'Jarhead' from a dozen other war movies. You see the same first act with the same bullying drill sergeant, the same fatal 'live round exercise', the same punishments in rain soaked and muddy yards. The characters are similarly cliché. We meet the weak bespectacled kid who we worry isn't going to make it, the psychopath who collects body parts, the career military-man who loves (and lives) to fight, the intellectual, the rebel, the cynic. The rules established by 'Apocalypse Now', 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'Platoon' are all clearly in place, laced with the cynical boredom of anti-establishment movies from 'Mash' to 'Buffalo Soldiers'.However, Jarhead is one of those rare movies that improves on reflection.The reason that Mendes so willfully embraces so many clichés is to support his claim that all wars, like all war movies, despite the superficial differences of time and setting, are essentially the same. The use of cliché, therefore, is not so much evidence of lazy writing, but a considered strategy for dramatizing the essential sameness of wars, battles and soldiers. Swofford gives voice to this idea in the movie's final moments, ""Every war is different, and every war is the sameI am every marine, and every marine is me"".The imagery of Vietnam, despite being 30 years old, IS the imagery of modern warfare. Jarhead is not the first movie to explore the legacy of Vietnam. But more importantly, it addresses the powerful mythologizing and fetishizing of that war, the way it has been reduced to little more than the pop-culture iconography of bedroom posters, music videos, T-shirts and magazine covers. In the mind of every man born since 1970, filed under masculinity, is an image of an unshaven marine in jungle fatigues, with a cigarette clenched in his teeth and an automatic weapon across his lap. The young men in Jarhead embrace the Fetish of Vietnam, reciting whole passages of dialogue from Apocalypse Now and singing along to the music. When helicopters fly overhead playing The Doors at full volume, Swofford looks up in despair and shouts, ""That's Vietnam music! Can't we have our own?"" Upon returning to the US, receiving a heroes' welcome despite having done nothing but sit in the desert for 6 months, the young marines are greeted by a Vietnam veteran. But they have nothing in common. There is no recognition, no identification, no camaraderie, no shared experience. They shift uncomfortably in their seats, refuse to make eye-contact; looking visibly embarrassed by this ugly reminder that their Vietnam myth is just that  a myth. The scene is one of the most powerful in the movie, as much for what it says about modern America's treatment of Vietnam veterans as much as Gulf War veterans.Performances are universally outstanding, with Gyllenhall proving once again that he is one of the most talented actors of his generation. Mendes, cinematographer Roger Deakins, and ILM, create a visually stunning, and often surreal, environment. Several scenes are breathtaking and are fine examples of how the successful collaboration of filmmakers and digital artists can attain a level of real artistry.Jarhead, while at times lacking focus and direction (much like the war it represents), is a brilliant and fascinating addition to an often clichéd genre. I don't know whether the movie's themes are explored with the same depth in the book, but it should not be so surprising that such insight into a very American condition should come from an English director. The British have long dealt with the repercussions of fading power and a dying empire, and it often takes a foreigner to shed new light on an issue so close to home. Whether the Academy will welcome such insight awaits to be seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is the army,"It is curious how a lot of (ex)militairy here rate the movie as only 1 star and complain how the army is so much different than this movie. Maybe they want it to be different but i can assure you it is not.I have been in the Dutch army for a year, drafted, and worked with the US army during drills in Germany, all i can say is : All armies are the same and the way Jarhead shows the army is almost 100% correct. It is about the first gulf war, but that is really not the point, it could be about any modern conflict.The boredom, the lack of sex, some psycho fellow soldiers, cliché drill instructors, the swearing, the porn the hookers, it's all true. What do you expect when you put a bunch of 18-24 year old males together with nothing to do but wait for possible death ?The last part was not even there in my army time when there was the cold war, it was just boredom. And let me tell you boredom converts 80% of young males without girls into raving mad maniacs.This movie excels in showing how it is to be in the, or any, western army service. It also shows the highway of death for what it is : A war crime.I strongly recommend anyone who is thinking about joining the army to watch this movie first, you might want to hold on to that job at 7-11 after seeing this.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
a well MASH-ed American Beauty,"I love the smell of anti war celluloid in the morning. Today's session had many male ticket-buyers and their friends staring at this excellent new anti war film by master director Sam Mendes. I was particularly impressed by the superb production values, the exact casting and later in the film, the iconic imagery re created largely in eye fooling miniatures and special effects. This is Donnie Darko in Iraq, 1991. I did not recognize Jamie Foxx and Peter Skaarsgard until late in the film...I almost thought I was seeing a Wayan and a Sutherland. Sam Mendes has a superb eye for detail and composition...and why you are seeing something the way he is showing it. To me this identifies a very good director. I believe JARHEAD is a very post modern take on a sad corner of American war like politics, a sign of waste and cruelty for economic reasons and as the scene on the bus at homecoming shows, a hollow victory wrapped in disillusionment and emotional bewilderment. What a great film! It just makes you cheer for the upside of free speech the USA chants (the same free speech that gets abused when crap like DEVILS REJECTS is made).......... JARHEAD is a perfect 2006 film for Dads to take their teenage sons to and have much to discuss and bond about later. More than anything it shows the evil in the detail of Marine life, the reality of the Mom in Farenheit 911 whose son's life was wasted by Bush's recruitment drive through unemployed teens in miserable US cities laid waste by politics and greed.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Cat as in cat food, Jarhead as in Horseshit","First of all, it's simply put as a horrible movie, do they really have to talk about themselves jacking off, getting their wives screwed by their neighbors or even the criminal records behind men in their squad, .. no, those are just what the director of the movie would call action shots, ... shots where the action is most intense, .. should of called this movie ((hard to say this word''movie'' while talking about jar head)),, this -movie- should been called Apocalypse NEVER, never ever,,,, none, zero,, no action, no psychology drama, no humor, no fictional interest (ie E.T.), no documentary profit for this -movie-,some say , oh it shows the real life in Iraq,,,, to them i say, you might as well put a knife in your blender rather than smoke till you drop, since you've obviously dropped already if your thinking this.. what kind of sick-minded person would like this movie,(spoilers) i was all hyped up to see this war movie, maybe thinking it ll hype me up to do my push-up session in my basement,(like apocalypse now, platoon, deer hunter, doom, , ) those movies date up to 10-15 years ago, and this, Jar-head a recent production is worst than watching blues clues, honestly , i could actually maybe get a laugh in blues clues, i even maybe get hyped up enough to push up,, anyways, since i'm not a strict critic, i'd give a 3, and even for someone as generous as me, this is the best i can give it,honestly",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Insanity in the Desert,"This is Sam Mendes third feature and it is his third incredible film.Jarhead is not so much a war film, but rather a film about war, the gulf war. A war which was fought in the air, rather than on the ground, face to face.The film is about how war, whether or not you kill someone, destroys the souls of young men (and women, although there is little doubt that this film concerns itself with testosterone.) It is about how aimlessness, and remoteness will send someone insane. It is about the average man who is expected to be too much, be too good, too tough, too malleable and who expected to take commands without question. It is about how wars tear families apart, destroy relationships and ultimately affect the relationships one builds in the future.This film is full of tension. Mendes gradually raises the feeling claustrophobia and of anxiety, which is met with devastating anti-climax.The film is aware of its place among the great American war films of the seventies, utilising an intelligent quoting of Apocalypse Now. The Young soldiers, or Jarheads, triumphantly recite the Ride of the Valkeries without any irony. Although the scene is obviously ironic. The Deer Hunter is also quoted, both films being anti-war.Roger Deakins brilliantly emphasises the malevolence through washed out looking scenes which cry with the hint of colour. The desert, the wide expanse of nothingness is filmed so accurately so that it becomes troubling.Gyllanhaal is brilliant, two fine performances in one year, as too is Foxx and Sarsgaard and Cooper in a small part.Not a perfect film by any means, but a film which has important things to say, which says them articulately.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best and true to life movies about the U.S. Marine Corps and war.,"I rented the ""Jarhead"" video just to see what the movie industry had to offer these days about the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC), and war. (I am a retired Naval Officer with 27 years of service, several tours of which involved service with Marine Corps elements.) Boy, was I surprised! At first I had to work around the language, including the frequent use of the ""F___"" word. Because of that, I almost quit watching it about half way through. But, I stuck with it, and am very happy that I did. Subsequent to my first viewing, I purchase my own copy of the ""Jarhead"" DVD, as well as the book upon which the movie is based - ""Jarhead"" by Anthony Swofford (""Swoff""), available at Amazon.com.The movie relates the USMC experiences of ""Swoff"", first in USMC Boot Camp, then in his training to become a 'sharpshooter with a STA (""Surveillance and Target Acquisition""), scout snipers platoon, and then his 6 months deployment in the 1990-1991 Gulf War against Iraq. Surprisingly, the movie script adheres to the real-life story in the book, with only slight variations. As I watched the movie, I became more and more entrenched in the unfolding life of a Marine ""Jarhead"". BTW, the term ""Jarhead"", is derived from a Marine's uniform haircut (very close on the sides and with about 1/4 - 1/2 inch on the top), which when viewed from the rear, literally looks like a jar with a lid on the top! The sometimes amusing events & occurrences in the Saudi & Kuwaiti desert are numerous, and very realistic, and do 'keep one on the edge of his seat', as they unfold.I have seen this movie 4 times, and plan to view it often. Because of the exceptional portrayal of the movie's 'hero', by ""Jake Gyllenhaal"", I did a search on the internet and found that there is quite a large group of fans who have an ongoing conversation about Jake and his movie career. To my surprise, I discovered that he is one of the two co-stars in ""Brokeback Mountain"", the DVD of which I have also purchased, and watched. (I had originally chosen not to watch this movie because of its bad rap as a ""Gay Cowboy movie"".) I have since watched every movie in Jake's career, but still count his role as ""Swoff"" in ""Jarhead"" as still his best and most poingent.If you are into realistic and gripping 'war' movies, with out all of the side 'crap' that Hollywood often includes in such movies (e.g., most of the movies about Vietnam), then I strongly recommend you rent or buy your own copy of ""Jarhead"" Believe me, it will stick with you for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Waiting is hell,"Everybody knows that war is hell. ""Jarhead"" wants us to know that waiting around for war isn't so great, either, especially when one is forced to do it from within a testosterone factory, full of young men who have been led to believe that they'll be shooting some dark-skinned, moustachioed types any minute. It's enough to make you crazy.Enough to make Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenahll) crazy, at least. It doesn't take long for Swofford to second-guess his decision to enlist in the Marines. ""Jarhead"" opens with a sort of homage to the famous Paris Island portion of Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket."" No tragic murder-suicide in this case, but around when his drill sergeant starts slamming heads into walls and shouting about his sexuality, Swofford begins to assume a glazed, jaded look. He's as excited as anyone else when his unit is ordered to Kuwait as part of Operation Desert Shield, though predicts on the plane that they'll be back before they've digested their complimentary peanuts. He whoops and hollers with everyone else at a rousing speech by the commanding officer full of references to ""the bureaucrats in Washington,"" kicking Iraqi ass, and other soldierly musings.But the ass-kicking doesn't seem to materialize. There's plenty of running around in the desert, target practice, and football games. Swofford's Staff Seargeant (Jaime Foxx) loves to pull surprise gas raid drills. A few of these ""jarheads,"" though, are sharp enough to notice that reality on the ground is quite a bit different than the official line, parroted gleefully by a lot of their comrades who can't wait to start killing Arabs. It's this cognitive dissonance that's at the heart of director Sam Mendes' movie. These guys have been pumped full of military hokum about the mysticism of their rifles, being killing machines, and the importance of the Corps, but life in the desert is largely consumed by domestic issues back home, and the killing of nothing more than time. There's a pressure-cooker of aggression here that's got no release valve. Swofford, at least, begins to lose his bearings. He shoves his gun in a comrade's face, and when the bombs do start falling, he can only stand there in a daze. As one marine points out, though, the war moves way too fast for troops on the ground. By the time they get mobilized, air strikes have pushed the front miles further back. Even the sight of a charred Iraqi convoy, strafed while trying to flee, arouses little emotion. The pilots are actually fighting the war; the grunts on the ground just sort of hang around it.""Jarhead"" at times feels unfocused, but I think that's the point. Combat and killing are psychologically scarring, but so is preparing people for such, then leaving them to wait in uncertainty. Back home in a victory parade, a Vietnam vet hops on the unit's bus to offer congratulations personally. He sits down, clearly having a moment of profound emotional connection with these new returnees. Swofford seems both to understand completely and feel miles apart. Combat isn't the only terrible thing war has to offer. While perhaps less intense in the moment, the buildup, aftermath, and peripherals exact a psychological toll as well, and create their own demons.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A great movie, despite what I got told.","Jarhead has been reviewed over here as a ""disappointment, failing to engage on many levels"" etc etc. Expecting it to be a bit of a dud with some funny moments, I still went to see it because I have a particular liking for military based films. I loved it. I thought that, while there were a few ""what?"" moments, it was overall a decent film, not absolutely choked with the standard ""sex, car chase & pretty women"". I haven't had such a good laugh at the movies for a while. I highly recommend this film. It is visually excellent and filled with the sort of odd humour I enjoy. I have to say that several times i was the only person in the cinema laughing - perhaps that's just the kiwi mindset.When this film eventually makes it to DVD over here, it will definitely be joining my collection. Jake Gyllenhall did a good job. So when is there going to be another sort of film like this one coming out?? I'll be waiting.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A real bowl-floater.,"Hollywood is a national disgrace for making movies like this that belittle our military. (Especially when we are at war.) These men and women have all volunteered to put their lives on the line to protect our freedom. Many have done so with tremendous personal loss, leaving their families and lucrative jobs behind just for the opportunity to serve and protect America. Some pay the ultimate price, many are severely wounded and crippled for their efforts. None of them deserve the phony leftist, communist, America hating portrayal put forth in this s--t storm of a film. This crap only serves to give aid and comfort to our enemies. It is tantamount to sedition. The director and producers of Jarhead should be charged with and convicted of treason and shot. If they have to demean our bravest warriors, they have no business living in America! Go to France and make your stinking movies!",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

As a Combat Vet I rate Jarhead: Brilliant!,"I skipped a grade and for my academic smartness, I was drafted into the Vietnam war after I graduated college art age 20! I am aproud member of the VFWWe had little support from the general populace ; the war was tearing America apart.I saw Jahead on TV and was stunned. It was so realistic that until I saw Jake Gyllenhall I realized it was a movie. Jake was great in this movie ( as he was in Broeback Mountain), and this film Jarhead left a searing impact on me.I urge all to see this film, it gets top rating from me.PS. No matter your political persuasion when you see a Military Man or woman thank them for their service. In my barracks at induction there were only men from blue color families.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jarhead Not worth the time,Jarhead was one of the worst war movies I've ever seen. It portrayed the marines as a incompetent unprofessional juvenile group of soldiers. The plot was non existent. Most of the movie the actors were just shown wandering aimlessly around the desert. The special effects were not even very realistic. This movie was an absolute disgrace to all our men in uniform and on top of that it wasn't even a good anti war movie. These marines acted more like draftees from the Vietnam era rather than volunteers. The emotion we see from them comes across as artificial and if we are to believe what we see most of these guys lose their girlfriends and wives while serving. Save your money! Stay home! This one isn't worth the price of admission.,1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""It's over man! And we'll never have to come back to this s***hole again!!","Man is this film good. It's both a great black comedy and a startling portrait of American machismo gone wrong in a war that was never fought. The great Bill Hicks once said this about the Gulf War. ""There never was a war. A war is when TWO armies are fighting."" See this was a new kind of war. This new style of war didn't need soldiers. Fire simply rained down from the sky and the enemies were vanquished. And so too were the conquerors, as the saying goes. The boys in this film, and boys they are, succumb to a morbid fascination with death and killing before they've ever really seen it or done it. They all want to get that first kill. That one perfect shot. They bake in the heat and sand and oil and smoke. They come out of it different people. Tortured by the slow, boring, unending routine of this modern war, needing that kill to truly be what they think is a real man perhaps, losing their identities and breaking down. Doing things most of us would never even think of considering. War breaks down man. What does it leave behind? Who do we become when the abyss stares back?",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
surprisingly good,"surprisingly good! So well filmed, directed, acted and written. The story is based on a marine's real experience in the Gulf War. It's quite realistic and biting, yet easy and fun to watch at the same time. This movie really tells you the truth. The truth is that they didn't fight, they didn't kill or shoot anyone. So they had to sit on their ass and jerk-off all the time in the friggin camp in the desert.Jake Gyllenhaul once again proved he's the most promising actor of his generation. But I was rather paying attention to Peter Saasgard. I think if he had given a bigger part in the film, he would have outperformed Jake. I'm continuously impressed by his acting talent and personality. He's the new Edward Norton.But all the credits must go to Sam Mendeth who's one of the finest directors in America today. This movie is highly recommended.""Oh boys, I just got a HARD-ON!"" - the colonel Chris Cooper",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
an unfulfilled classic,"i saw this last night and i'd heard mixed opinions of it which seems the problem. The moment Jarhead was announced Sam Mendes the man responsible for American Beauty, a perfectly sculpted comment on lost innocence and alienation takes on war the heart of lost innocence and not only that the gulf war, the ultimate metaphor of alienation and something somewhat feared by Hollywood, not only that but Jake Ghylenhaal, Hollywoods newest wonder boy and star of everybody's favourite cult film was to star. It was touted as the apocalypse now or Full Metal Jacket for the new generation. Apocalypse now it isn't but it could have been. There are countless scenes which could have become iconic, playing American Football in chemical suits and the branding of Troy. Don't mistake me these are still memorable scenes but they are not classic making scenes like the beach attack in Apocalypse now, i also felt Jarhead lacked a character as memorable as Killgore or Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. The film seems very much to be cut up into two halves Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm- the first half (in which Swafford is trained and very suddenly sent to operation desert shield) is well done with ironic music and top one liners (alot of ironic humour, lines such as ""thank god we never have to see to this sh*t hole again"" referring to Iraq) punctuating a general feeling of honesty as to what actually happens in the army. When they hit the desert for operation desert shield i don't believe Mendes has achieved the effect he hoped for, we should feel like we're waiting for something to happen, we should fell like Swaff and the others. The football game should have appeared out of this, just something to do, not playing up for the cameras then it would have been iconic especially if filmed like any given Sunday or Friday night lights. When Swaff loses it with the other soldier was great and perfectly acted by Gylenhaal. When Desert storm begins is when i think the film really takes off you begin to feel really frustrated as they chase the war and the scenes at the burnt out barricade type thing are harrowing, they really make a point as does the friendly fire incident. You really start to feel for Swaf and Troy as they miss the chance at a kill and seeing them go back to their everyday lives makes it's point nicely. The cinematography is stunning there's little more i can say for it, you just have to see the desert after it rains oil. Overall this is a great film but not a classic, it lacks the memorable scenes which make it's predecessors so iconic except the point when the soldiers watch apocalypse now. If it ha been handle with a slightly higher level of skill it would easily have lived up to it's name.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Anti-American/Military Propaganda,"This is a most disappointing movie, IMHO. I went to it with an open mind and thinking it would be have profanity but to see the American military depicted as uncaring and unsensitized men was beyond the pale. If the producer/directors had a goal to make women tell their men to ~not join the Marines~ they would succeed in lowering the draft rate. If the produces/directors had the goal to make young men decide against a career in the Marines, they would also succeed. There was the expected profanity but the Military that I am proud of: those brave men and women who have liberated Iraq and secured freedom for Afghanistan (and who so bravely protect and defend our own freedoms at home and abroad), movies should show them At Their Best and not try to lower their morale. WE ARE AT WAR and this war against terrorism will probably last a generation; methinks the quicker America faces up to this fact the better; it's a war between good and evil and I'm grateful for the ~most part~ it's being fought in a far-away land and not in the streets and cities of America.....yet; let's PRAY we have the steel backbone of the American public; the terrorists know they cannot win against our military but they do know if they are patient that perhaps they can destroy the will of the ~folks back home.~",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Semper Fi,"Jarhead grabs the viewer's attention from the beginning and carries it through to the ending credits. A movie depicting the harsh reality of marine going through boot camp and being sent off to fight in Desert Storm. War movies always hit hard because you know there are millions of people going through this, even as I type these words. This movie was no more shocking to the system than movies like ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". War is real. This movie has many funny parts and thank god, otherwise it would be way to depressing. It really makes you think; knowing the person who wrote the book is also the main character. I really enjoyed this movie. It makes you think and realize how messed up to world can actually be. Definitely a must see movie for anyone who likes war flicks, but believe me you don't have to be a die hard war flicks fan or someone who has served to enjoy Jarhead.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Chris Cooper ,same role?","Having just seen ""Jarhead"" yesterday I wonder if anyone else thought that actor,Chris Cooper could essentially be playing the same character as he did in ""American Beauty"",and if so was this a deliberate reference on the part of director Sam Mendes. I can't remember the rank of the of the marine played by cooper in the first film but given the timing of the first gulf war it is certainly chronologically possible that this is the same person. Anyway,that little piece of train spotting aside ,I found ""Jarhead"" to be an insightful piece of flaking. Wile some have criticized the film for being pointless in it's narrative,I believe that this was a deliberate and effective device on the part of the director to convey the idealogical void which the soldiers increasingly inhabit. The increasing dissatisfaction of the marines in the desert is a stark counterpoint to the excellent ""Apocolypse now"" sequence earlier in the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Hoilywood is a leftist bubble, out of touch with the actual sentiments of the United States, its soldiers and citizens. This film is a blitz of negativity about the marines, the U.S., and war itself.

Breaking the modern war movie mold,"When it was released in 1998, Saving Private Ryan immediately established a new trend for future war movies. The quick, relatively painless deaths portrayed in older, more conventional war movies were replaced by brutal, incredibly graphic ones and battle scenes were more realistically laid out on screen. Then again, most of these movies centered around the casualty-ridden battles of older wars like WWII and Vietnam. In Jarhead, we get to see another side of human conflict; the minimal combat modern-day political war. The first Persian Gulf War, the focus of Jarhead, lasted less than 100 days and produced less than 200 American casualties, many of which were caused by friendly fire. For many troops who were deployed to the sands of Iraq and Saudi Arabia, there was no war. What do you do when you're sent to war and there's no war to fight? When you're trained to be a killer, what do you do when there's no enemy to kill? Jarhead examines these questions frankly, engrossingly, and memorably. The plight of Marines struggling to contain their boredom and insanity while an international conflict is raging on their doorstep is all too evident and real. It's a startling contrast to the loud, frantic ambushes of violence of other ""modern"" war movies in the mold of Saving Private Ryan. While Jarhead doesn't completely rationalize the questions posed, it's impossible to rationalize something as devastating as war. When all is said and done, it's a riveting look at another side of war that for the most part had been left unobserved. The images and words spoken by the movie's servicemen convey that sense of the unknown that only the field of battle can produce. In a small way, the audience will leave Jarhead feeling like they themselves have been to war.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's war Jim...but not as we know it,"It's war, Jim...but not as we know it. At least, not as we know it from Hollywood war movies of past. Except that Jarhead cannot help but draw on predecessors, of which the two that spring to mind while watching it are Apocalypse Now (which gets more than just a namecheck here, in a way which may surprise who thought Coppola's Vietnam epic was universally considered anti-war) and All Quiet On The Western Front. It's about the ennui of war - those yawning moments of boredom between sheer-terror action. But boredom generates its own moments of action, as would expected with a load of hyped-up, testosterone-fuelled young men stuck in the desert with no women, no booze and no idea of what the politicos are doing (and what they're going to do to them). It's beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted with many riveting moments, but it's definitely down-beat rather than gung-ho. Don't go expecting shock-and-awe: this is more Journey's End set in late 20th- century. Best moment: Sarge telling Jake why he's a marine, even though he could be pocketing a cool 100,000 comfortably working back home, and saying something along the lines of ""In what other job could you see something like this?"" And they gaze across the desert nightscape where the oil wells are blazing fiercely into the sky.

War and the Changing Nature of Masculinity,". Men are striped of any femininity and are exposed to inhumane acts. Jarhead portrays the ""norm"" for men in today's representation of the media, the norm being a patriotic, heterosexual male trying to kick some ass. In the movie Jarhead, Jake Gyllenhaal plays a young US marine who has followed the path of his past generations to the military.In the movie Jarhead homo-eroticism is deflected by the act of war. The men's desire to kill destroys any sign of femininity within themselves. By hunting down the enemy the men take their inner sexual frustrations and push it outward, killing off their enemy. Inner conflicts with femininity are shot dead, by killing the enemy they are symbolically killing off their feminine attributes.. This image of US marines standing there, shooting their rifles shows their ""masculinity"" and makes them feel secure with their sexuality",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Its all fun and games until ...,"First off I think people need to know that this is not an action movie. That being said, I love how the movie starts out being hilarious, and the longer you get into the movie, and the longer the troops have been in Iraq, the more serious the movie gets. I think that captures the psychological journey that a lot of young soldiers must go through (and in a sense a lot of young people turning adults as well, I guess). Before they go to Iraq they are excited and even looking forward to it, but when they are there, it seems that this almost claustrophobic feeling sets in. It dealt nicely with other topics as well, but these were the ones that I found most interesting.
It was a relief to watch a war movie that wasn't really glorifying and overly dramatic about being in the military. Their everyday life in Iraq seemed pretty mundane and boring (not saying the movie was boring though, very much the opposite), which I think was a super refreshing take on a war movie.

Thank god... Ooorah,"Something new, finally.In the story that tells about the Persian Gulf War in 1991, Jake Gyllenhaal tells the story as the soldier Anthony Swofford, a soldier who experienced firsthand the war with the Middle Easterners. A war that was filled with boredom, and complete isolation from the rest of the world, and how the world on the other side responded to them, which was responded in a graphic, disturbing, and almost tragic, way.As part of being one of the late contenders in the year, ""Jarhead"" is a success to those who were there, and a failure to those who sat in their chairs and watched it from the seat of their comfortable dens and family rooms. Staff Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx), is portrayed in positive light, and enforces his presence with every demanding breath that he takes in, in this film, not only for the purpose of the demanding man that he was, but the way that the war, and the film itself, should have been demanded, in a form of respect.Another pleasant surprise has been touched on the big screen a lot in the past couple of months, as Peter Sarsgaard delivers a stand up performance as Troy, the spotter for Swofford, who was the shooter in their sniper Platoon, in this amazing triumph for dignity, pride, and national respect for the country that one mush fight for in order to come back as a hero, and a well honored soldier, not a coward.You're in the army now.
