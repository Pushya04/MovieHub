Forget Disney! We have movies like Your Name.,"Your Name is just a good movie. This movie felt long, but not too long. All the way through, I was asking what would happen next. It was clever, emotional, and left me crying after the movie. The twist was done really well, and I almost wanted to pause the movie. Also, the animation is gorgeous. You get to see detailed images from many angles and perspectives, and there were hundreds of animators! The credits didn't start out with the cast like it usually would. The first thing you saw after a black screen was hundreds of names of animators and designers. I watched this movie again and I still felt my muscles ready to let tears out. I would not recommend this movie any less than the next guy, so what are you waiting for? Get a couple of friends and watch Your Name!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
could be the greatest love story of all time,"In truth, the most competitive area of fiction is not invasions from outer space or talking dogs or impossible missions but rather the most basic narrative of all, the love story.And this is also the most overcrowded field, and the most difficult to do right.This film, this story, is extraordinary. It reminds me of MY SASSY GIRL, a love story from Asia that captured the imagination of the world and has almost become a franchise, it's been copied so many times.It also brings to mind Richard Matheson's classic BID TIME RETURN, another love story for the ages that uses time juxtaposition. (Done as the movie SOMEWHERE IN TIME, 1980).I already gave this the highest rating on the IMDb.The animation is stunning and complimentary to this one-of-a-kind tale.All things considered, I would like to avoid the ongoing arguments about which Japanese animation studio is better, or worse, than the other.I prefer to simply be grateful that Japanese anime exists at all, because I cannot imagine any other country producing something this moving, this powerful, in graphic form.((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

Beautiful,"I went in to see Kimi no Na ha without knowing anything about the movie. I had simply been intrigued by the movie poster with the comet as a background to two high school students living in wildly different environments - and the excellent reviews on its Friday release convinced me to see it just the day after.Not knowing anything about the movie made me relish every single moment of it. The two main characters would, it seems, never have the occasion to meet each other, but through a mysterious circumstance are led to share some of their waking hours with each other. At first, the movie struck a compelling, funny and nostalgic view at high school life in Japan, love, friendship, puberty, teenage angst and some elements of mysticism. It felt like a very fresh and charming sentimental love comedy with a dash of depth and teenage angst. And it already utterly captured me at that point.Yet midway, the movie veers resolutely into dramatic, and more mystical territory, while managing to keep the lighthearted tone it had reached during the first half at just the right moments. Together with one of the main characters, I was shocked and powerless upon learning of one aspect that had eluded both protagonists, as well as the audience. At the same time, a trope often used in science-fiction got thrown into the mix and the stakes suddenly get much higher, making me look back to the first half of the movie and thinking ""wwwooooowww I get it now"", while following the paths of the protagonists, which, just like the Kumi Himo (thread making?) that Miyamizu Shrine makes, represent time itself. Meeting, diverging, tangling, getting cut, doubling back. The second half of the film is a perfect adventure, full of suspense, humor, hope, and yes, tears. And at some points, it gets close to tragedy (one scene in a train left a huge lump in my throat). In some respect it reminded me of Spirited Away (my long time favorite animation movie), in which both main characters grow thanks to the other, and whose paths had crossed and would cross again, beyond memory or reality.Saying more would spoil the movie, so I have been very, very vague. Suffice it to say the movie made me laugh, cry, get the goosebumps, and got me to the edge of my seat at some points. It really had great storytelling, pacing, characters, and emotions throughout. I loved it.The visuals were also gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous. Tokyo is more real than the real Tokyo, and the director, animators, background artists, and computer artists seem to have devilish fun playing with lighting and getting some of the most beautiful scenes and moments I can recall in an animation movie.I should mention the music as well, which was very, very good. I know RADWIMPS (I went to see them live a couple of years back), but was surprised at the tone they achieved, and how well it fit with the movie - the music, along with the visuals, really help in getting a full immersion into the story.However, some of the most hilarious jokes in the movie seem to be untranslatable to English - in particular the ""dialects"" of the main characters, as well as a specific moment that makes use of several of the ways that Japanese people use to refer to themselves, depending on context and sex (watashi, watakushi, boku, ore). So I'm looking forward to seeing how those scenes will be handled in the translation!I have since seen the movie one more time, bought the OST, and bought and read the novelization (which is almost like the movie, but does give more insight into each character's thoughts and thought processes.). Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
I am speechless.,"So the movie is named ""Your name?"" and its a perfect title, it doesn't reveal anything about the content and yet it caught my interest. I tend to watch animated movies because they have so much more to offer at the same time it is a tougher competition.The story line is really good, why? Well it you are open minded it will be pretty easy to follow and accept what is going on, question about how and why get answered by themselves if you believe it is possible. Regarding the animation it give you what your mainstream point of view of Japans architecture, nature, culture and society, all from how they dress to the body language etc. The music, sound effects and voice actor/actress amplifies the emotions and guides you from start till end. There are plenty of a messages and it makes me thing about me and everything living around me, where I come from and where I am going. Regarding the character development its spot on, no more information was needed then what was provided, we are limited but at the same time free to make our own thought.I wish to say thank you to everyone who have supported and/or worked with this piece of art, they should feel really proud of themselves, it is an honor that you shared it with us (the viewers). Thank you!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Phenomenal,"Kimi no Nawa is up there with the quality of work Studio Ghibli makes. It's a journey in a world breathing with atmosphere, mystery, and visual wonder. A journey about growth and resilience in the face of overwhelming odds. A journey about human emotion that transcends space and time, as we watch our two protagonists struggle relentlessly against fate. A journey that might just be one of the most captivating anime movie experiences I've had in years.Director Makoto Shinkai's artistry is something people tend to love or hate, but this film is solid proof to all of his disdainful critics that his movies were never ""just eye candy"". They explore the nature of life and relationships in quiet ways rarely seen or discussed, which is why most of them are not fast-paced or action packed...and why they are so beautiful. But even if you're not a fan of this kind of style with its major use of metaphorical imagery and mixture of subtle and explosive emotions, definitely give Kimi no Nawa a chance. This is by far his most ambitious, original movie in many ways. For instance, there's an actual mystical element to the story apart from his previous films that are set purely on realism. The pacing is a lot faster and intense. There's a surprising amount of humor in the script, making the chemistry between the characters more light-hearted and comically entertaining than expected. All of this is done through a narrative vision so emotional, so brilliantly realized, that I'm pretty sure everyone at the Anime Expo world premiere screening was tearing up, including me.Without spoiling, what mainly drives this film's story is the dynamics of our main characters' relationship. The way these two interact is just so unique and lovable. The premise itself allows them to bond on a more personal level, far more intriguing than the usual teenage love story where boy meets girl, boy likes girl, boy gets girl. Eventually, you become so invested in their strange relationship, that when all the action goes down, it's no longer just suspenseful - it's almost heartbreaking.Editing and sound design play a HUGE role in this immersion. There's rarely a single dull moment because of how gripping and emotionally driven the timing of every cut is. The sound design combined with a beautiful music score is outstanding - subtle and moving when creating atmosphere, powerful at times of dramatic conflict. In fact, the same can be said for pretty much all of the visual aesthetics - which if I haven't already mentioned, are amazing. This is a prime example of astonishingly jaw-dropping animation combined with powerful storytelling.Kimi no Nawa is not just any anime movie. It has the potential to be viewed and studied as art cinema. It's so beautifully crafted and meticulously detailed, I feel like I didn't even cover 80% of its greatness in this review. To do that, I would have to make a spoiler analysis review, and to do that, I would probably have to see the movie again, maybe a couple more times before I can fully appreciate this nearly flawless masterpiece.I know I sound like I'm fanboying, but as a film student and anime fan for many years, I'm being fully honest here - if Director Makoto Shinkai keeps this kind of quality up, he is going to be an even bigger name in the anime industry for years to come. Remember Your Name long enough until it's available in your country, if you're not seeing it in Japan theaters. Because trust me, you're not going to forget it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A beautiful piece of art, but the quality of the story is held back by Makoto Shinkai's ability to take that extra step,","I think most of us can safely say that as far as pure direction and art go, Makoto Shinkai's popular new movie called ""Your Name"" has taken the world by storm. As of now, it has won several large prizes and it's praised by casual watchers and critics alike.There is no doubt that this is in fact one of Makoto Shinkai's most beautiful pieces of art as far as pure visual fidelity goes. That, in combination with its engrossing soundtrack just allows the movie to speak to the heart directly. This often means that people will refrain from criticising this movie, and i find myself being a lone bird flying in the opposite direction of all the others when it comes to this movie.The issue i have with this movie doesn't lie in its art, or in its direction. It more lies within the lack of depth in the story itself. Makoto Shinkai is known for using repetitive settings in his movies, as they do tend to sell well.I just wish Makoto Shinkai would have been a bit more creative in his writing, rather than making me think ""oh, it's this again. Not very original."" The story is confusing, but once i figured it out it didn't leave me lost in thought and i was honestly disappointed.That being said, Your Name is still a solid movie with stunning animation and I'd recommend you try watching it yourself. It's not very long and it's definitely worth a watch purely because it looks stunning.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Once seen, never forgotten- truly magnificent","'Your Name' is not just one of the best animes in recent years (and there have been some very good ones), but one of the best animes ever from personal opinion.Will go even further, saying it's one of the best animated films in recent years, one of the best animated or otherwise films of the year and that it rivals the masterworks of Miyazaki. This is a huge compliment, for any anime, animated film or even any film, and a bold claim that still stands. Much of it is to do with how 'Your Name's' stayed with me and the impact it's had, a film once seen but never forgotten.The animation in 'Your Name' is stunning, so beautifully and intricately drawn with immaculate attention to detail in the backgrounds and a simply breath-taking array of ethereal but also atmospheric colours. The music fits the film's atmosphere with no problem at all and also works wonders as a soundtrack on its own, serving superbly as music on its own.Meanwhile, the script is thought-provoking and touching, with much to say and explored expertly and neatly with no heavy-handedness. The storytelling engages throughout, sucks one into its world and never lets go of the immersing and is enormously heartfelt, really investing in the characters' chemistry and their love for each other. Pacing is deliberate, but never drags due to the emotional impact and how well realised the characters are, even when noticeably slower in the second half.Characters, and the film's themes, are brilliantly written and developed, and the voice acting is emotive and fit the characters with no qualms.In summary, a truly magnificent film all round that will be remembered for years to come. Deserves all the raves it's gotten, and deserving of even more. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A visually pleasing film with depth, but with little weight","As an avid follower of the works of Studio Ghibli, this film had much to live up to, especially considering its deeper themes and the exploration of a different, more subtle sort of romance between two individuals separated by time and space. Unfortunately, this film turned out exactly as I expected and feared, with an interesting storyline and basis, yet the characters, dialogue, and overall crafting of the story itself detracted from the overall quality. I will focus mainly on the negatives in this review, as there are a plethora of other reviews that seem to only focus on the highlights.The main issue that I had with Your Name was the script. Having seen it both in the original Japanese with English subtitles, and also dubbed (on my second viewing) with the English voice actors, I was really hoping for the proper brevity and gravity that Studio Ghibli so constantly delivers. However, I was met with the characters stuck in an endless loop of telling viewers what they were feeling, and especially in the more intimate moments of the film, where this could have been left more to the viewers deduction – if someone is crying for a particular reason, it is often best left for the viewers to decide why; the character does not always need to vocalise their feeling in order to convey them. For this reason, I felt that I had very little attachment to the characters in a setting where attachment to the characters was vital.Furthermore, I believe that very little of the humour in this movie worked for the better. As I stated before, in a movie as heartfelt and intimate as this, the dialogue and the humour should be handled with the utmost care, and most of the time throughout the movie, I felt as if it took you away from the story – by all means, there certainly would be moments of humour when a boy switches bodies with a girl and vice versa, but humour was not the purpose of this movie, and this should have been respected.One last, and slightly more subjective gripe, but I found the music choices to often be contradictory and 'annoying,' to say the least. I understand that the montage sequence, set to an upbeat pop/rock song is a common event in the world of anime, and having seen many anime outside of Studio Ghibli myself, I understand and respect this. However, with a movie such as your name, I found it only broke apart the emotional storyline, and in many ways, lost some of the viewers investment in the story. The piano sequence (the main theme, I believe?) was beautiful; why not exclusively keep the orchestral/piano score throughout the entire movie? Overall, Your Name was a very solid attempt at a very difficult premise, with beautiful visuals, a poorly handled storyline, and not much else. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good made movie, not that great plot.","This movie will please those people that have that teen romantic side. That side that says that your love is somewehere on the world, and you will be together by some sort of mystical or non-conventional way. If you don't have that teen side don't watch that movie. Don't get me wrong, It's well made. But the plot falls short, it misses the opportunity to talk about more interesting topics rather than one hour and a half about a teen mind-made romantic history. It can talk about want to be another person and what you are now, or the need to have a femenine and a masculine perspective for having much more empathy... Overall, I was very disappointed.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Cosmically enchanting, touching and visually beautiful.","It's been a while since I've seen something outside of Studio Ghibli, being the most recent When Marnie Was There. I'm not familiar with Makoto Shinkai's work but this certainly encourages me to watch the rest of his catalog.I knew nothing about the film until only the day before seeing it, instantly attracted to the poster and the mini synopsis of two high school teens from opposite sides of the country, who periodically switch in their dreams.Gladly I didn't read anymore into it and just went to watch it as there's so much more to the intriguing story at face value. It's a little confusing at times bouncing between the two characters, but that doesn't deter the enjoyment and wonderment of the film.We follow quiet country school girl Mitsuha voiced by Mone Kamishiraishi, going about her daily chores and traditions in a village shrouded by folklore and superstition with mayor-elect pushing for advancement. All this while we also follow rough-and-ready city boy, Taki, voiced by Ryûnosuke Kamiki, who is no stranger to voice acting, starring in Spirited Away at the age of eight and later in Howl's Moving Castle.The two become celestially bound to one another without fully understanding how, or even knowing who each other are, which leads them both on an adventure of discovery, comical annoyance and eventual romance. It's perfectly balanced between the two even with a number of interesting side characters, each adding something to the intricacies of the plot and supplying a lot of the light-hearted comedy.The scenery and animation is stunning, vibrant and beautifully breathtaking; with blinding lens flares and gorgeous landscapes that fill the entirely screen. It's superbly paced, perfectly edited so not to make a mess of the constant jumps.The score by the Japanese rock band, Radwimps is simply amazing, perfect for the film with a mixture of teeny pop/rock and pleasant instrumentals, with surprising tracks like ""Kataware Doki"" using soft pianos and strings. It's a score Final Fantasy composer, Nobuo Uematsu would be proud of.There are some films that are not meant to be for live action, showcasing the stunning craftsmanship and elegant talent of the skilled animators and artists, this being one of those films. The actual anime capturing the magical essence of the heartfelt story that I don't believe can be replicated as good live.Cosmically enchanting, touching and visually beautiful. Certainly the best anime I've seen this year.Running Time: 9 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 10 Story: 10 Script: 10 Creativity: 10 Soundtrack: 9 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being such a wonderful, beautiful, romantic story, magical in every sense.

One of the Greatest movies i watched in my entire life.,"I have followed Makoto Shinkai's older works and most of them really have a bad ending, though still good, but this movie's sweet. He really know how to play with our emotion, especially for his work's fans who have followed his works, i'm hoping its not a bad ending during the entire movie.But man, this work is a true masterpiece. When i looked at Makoto's older works, I suddenly think, he had the potential to beat Miyazaki's spirited away, and there he goes. I'm not saying this is better than spirited away, they had a different genre and makoto had his own stunning style.How this piece of animation would turn my emotion really hard?

"Yes, yes and yes!","Absolutely fantastic! Recommended for everyone.Just watch it.Amazing characters, scenery, city life and town life, story. Everything is just wow. So fine! The suspension, the empathy, the scenes. The thoughts. It's playful and pleasant, but serious and funny at the same time. It makes you want to feel it and live it, while you just keep cheering for everything.This 1.5 hours was one of the most well spent time in my life. It was so good, that I actually sit down and wondered why we can't we live like that? Why can't we be in that village? In that anime Tokyo?Every minute is a time well-spent. It's a time SO well spent, that I was afraid when it's going to end. I literally just realized that this would be the end of an anime. Than this would be the end of an hour long movie.I was so afraid when it's going to end. It borough such a beautiful and marvelous utopia before my eyes, with all it's mistakes, conflicts. That I actually wanted to live there. I actually realized however, that I'm not good of a person to be worthy of such utopia.However it is very close to reality. Every time something out of order happens, you remember. This is a certain reality. People can die, be ashamed, punished. Everything can end in a tragedy. But when something wrong happens, nobody really cares.. and I was like: ""Why? Why aren't you moving? Are you not afraid for your lives?"" Than I remembered.. this is a certain utopia. Even for the people who live in it. Nothing bad happen to them, nothing really could. They are peaceful, good people, in a modern world. Nothing bad happened in the last 3 generation, why would anything happen now?This movie gave me a new set of feelings, viewpoints, happiness, thoughts and desires, I might have lacked or just not realized before.

"What seems to be a silly premise evolved into something even more trifling. But with its unbearable charm, it worked astonishingly well.","Your Name (Kimi No Na Wa) tells the story of two teenagers with vastly different backgrounds. One is a boy who lived in Tokyo and has the word ""city"" described all around him. One is a girl who lived in rural town far from technology and anything interesting. One morning, somehow, they found out that they have swapped bodies. Together, they must help each other find solution in daily life problems, and solve the mystery of the reason why this whole conundrum started.This may sound like your typical body-swap romantic comedy situation, but you may find yourself on the wrong side of the spectrum as this movie takes you into an incredible journey. With a storytelling so divine, complex, yet understandable, this movie captures the essence of what romantic comedy movies have lost nowadays, a heart and a charm to lure you in.Japanese animation movies tend to have a bit of a stereotype, but the movie successfully shown very little of that. Transitioning from one scene to the other effortlessly, Radwimps deserves an incredible applause for their talents in the movie, as every song and every score fits perfectly to the scene currently shown.Although the movie does end in a predictable way, the voyage to that predictable end is more than enough to keep you satisfied. There are some usage of stock characters and several clichés throughout, something that maybe will drive some of the audiences away or cloud their judgment. But beside all that, the story is still original and well executed.What seems to be a silly premise evolved into something even more trifling.

why YOUR NAME is the best animated movie of the last five years,"Your Name is a journey about growth and having the ability to bounce back when thrown against overpowering hardships. It's a journey that focuses on human emotion that are larger than time and space. It's a journey of where we watch our protagonists struggle again and again against destiny. And it's one of the greatest animated journeys you will ever experience.Watch the review at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7v32c900F4 and / or read along hereYour Name follows a girl from the country and a boy from the city who have never met that switch bodies when they dream.This movie may seem like your romantic-comedy body-swap situation. But it will surprise you how in depth the gets. The storytelling here is top notch, because you understand everything, but when you think about it, the concept gets quite confusing, but because of the brilliant direction my Shinkai, he somehow makes it understandable.The two protagonists are the driving force of the film instead of Shinkai's normal eye candy visual sell outs. Within the great writing are actually some very funny and memorable conversations. The comedy works well to add another layer to the great chemistry between the protagonists. Props to the actors.It was just so fun watching the dynamic feelings of these two and I loved how the two genders figured each other out while inhabiting the others' body.I was a little confused when a lot of the first act is dedicated to the girl, without really seeing the movie from the boy she's swapping with, his view. But the movie surprised me when something happened to the girl and we see the boy for most of the rest of the movie. So actually the screen time for both protagonists were quite similar. That blew me away.If you delve deep into his work Shinkai tends to break the forth wall often in the way he portrays emotions. He, in a way, makes you reflect upon your own life, and all his movies are really, really relatable. He makes you look back on dark times, times you don't really want to think about again and he says a different messages every movie.A big part of the film was it's editing and sound design. This all helped with the immersion. Every scene is dripping with hidden details covered in immense beauty sugar coated with an outstanding soundtrack played by Radwimps.And although the end is predictable, it did what 5 Centimetres Per Second didn't do. It left me satisfied.What seemed like a stupid idea turned into Your Name. And it's not just another Japanese animation.There are so many scenes where it feels like the Shinkai just pulls the rug from underneath you, like the movie doesn't always follow the normal routine. I felt so many emotions in this movie.It grips you in that way and shows that every second in the movie and in life is important.This movie takes every awesome element that Shinkai has ever used in his films and are all constrained into this movie. This film has jaw dropping photo-realistic visuals with beautiful Japanese voice work, great cinematography, laugh out loud comedy, gripping story, insane twists, looming soundtrack, heart racing action, unforgettable quotes.But the best part about this movie is that it has very few mistakes. Everything is in the film for a reason.Still, I don't feel like I've covered most of the points of why this movie was so good without spoiling anything.But I can say that when I watched it, it was something special. Looking around at other reviews and forums, I have a feeling, that this will be regarded as one of the best animated movies ever made.A+10 / 10Watch more reviews like this at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfNozbWd9SJYYwLK2zYn_AA",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Hold onto that feeling,"Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world. Just a city boy...No, wait. Hear me out.Granted, it's initially hard to sell Your Name - a meet cute anime twist on Freaky Friday - as a worthwhile recipient of its considerable, well-deserved hype, rather than a big screen, big budget rendition of Fruits Basket. But the hype is real. Inauspicious or not, writer/director Makoto Shinkai's film is somewhat of a genre-bending game changer - a film so special that the struggle to properly do justice to it leaves me resorting to inelegantly cherrypicking from a slew of contemporary allusions (the elegant loneliness of Murakami; the mischievous whimsy of Wong-Kar Wai; an Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind interwoven with The Breakfast Club with the most imperceptible pinch of your average buddy cop comedy comedy for spice), while it is still far more than the sum of their parts. In short, it's one of the most unexpected, simple but profound, entrancing, and poetically beautiful films to cross screens in years. It's as fun as it is melancholy, as unforgettable as it is sweetly unassuming. Even better - it's that rare anime where comparisons to Studio Ghibli aren't simply lip service, but actually warranted in terms of exquisite, painstaking heart and attention to detail. Yes, really.But such lofty praise is actually far from the spirit of a film that goes about its remarkable business with a cheeky subtlety. Shinkai wisely plays off the initial silliness of his concept, with the early body swap sequences staying rooted in lighter, bawdier humour, playfully portrayed with a springy, sassy wit keeping even the broadest moments no less human and adorable for their broadness. The conceit itself is kept indifferently vague, apart from the haziest of nods to traditional spirituality - it's not the 'how' that matters here anywhere near as much as the 'what.' Similarly, there's a clearly delineated dichotomy between the two protagonists' 'tradition vs. modernity' milieus (with larger, extrapolating themes of supplanting history and cultural longing spanning generations to be teased out by those keen enough), but Shinkai is content to let the contrast sit, rather than milking it for shoehorned theme, or garish social commentary.More than anything, the film captures that ethereal but omnipresent sense of vague dissatisfaction, longing, and persistent but directionless striving that is bound to feel almost achingly familiar to any given audience member, regardless of age, nationality, or standing in life. Shinkai takes a distressingly familiar sense of ennui, and infuses it with a melancholy grace, a feeling accentuated hugely by the film's simply gorgeous, sweeping artwork, infusing panoramas of mountain-dwarfed Japanese countrysides and bustling Tokyo skyscrapers with an unbelievable level of composition and care. When the film glissandos into a third-act twist that is as devastating as it is unpredictable for all but the most eagle-eyed of viewers, it transcends into a piece of larger-than-life folklore, conjuring an almost feverishly heightened viewership that redefines magnetic, before culminating with a quiet grace note that ties up the emotional knot in ways both elegiac and unforgettably uplifting. It may sound like a perennial squall of emotional peaks and valleys, but Shinkai surfs it with nonchalant poise, with his rock-steady pacing lending the film an almost uncanny gestalt. Upon the arrival of the closing credits, don't be surprised to hear a wet gasp, equal parts tearful and jubilant, erupting from your throat, unsolicited. You won't be alone in doing so.If there are any imperceptible faults to be found, it's that Shinkai's perhaps inevitable leaning on anime tropes do, at times, dip the film into conventions it would normally nimbly leap over. The occasional conflict-expanding plot device or bombastic musical interlude, particularly in gearing up for the film's climax, strain convention in ways that are only startling in their inconsistency with the film's customary elegance, while lead actors Mone Kamishiraishi and Ryûnosuke Kamiki, while both lending credibly commanding voices, are as hyperbolic as they come in their grunts, gasps, and other verbalizations reacting to their bizarre circumstances.Still, these are the faintest blemishes on the face of a truly beautiful, touching film, that truly demonstrates that the affective potential of traditional animation still has many wrinkles of uncanny power yet to unfurl. So do yourself a favour: believe the hype. Invest in Your Name. If you have any space amidst the ensuing deluge of feelings, you may just thank yourself you did.-9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

7.5/10 - An Interesting Film With Beautiful Visuals,"Your Name. Is the first anime that I review, I think, and that's a very adored anime almost all over the anime community, from what I've seen. I haven't read the visual novel, btw, so the review will solely refer the film.Your Name. Is a romance/drama(/fantasy?...) film, that follows a Tokyo boy named Taki and a small town girl called Mitsuha, as one day they woke up one day and found themselves one in the body of the other. I won't spoil anything, but I'd generally say that this film is about the bond between the both of them, and bonds in general.I like a lot of things about this film, and I'll start with the thing that everyone who've watched this film noticed - the animation. This movie is simply stunning, visually. It looks so colorful and vibrant, and I really like the animation's aesthetic. (especially in the opening shot and in the surreal scene with the red string)
I've also enjoyed the plot, overall - it kept me interested, it has some interesting concepts in it, and I like the overall structure of this film. The string/line motive is quite cool.The soundtracks slaps, too, and it really fits the tone of the movie.Now, I have like one major issue with this film, so, yeah.The issue - Taki is criminally underwritten. Like, okay, the viewer can pick up on some things that we're only shown briefly to gather info about his character (which is another praise that I can give this movie. In a quite subtle way, the film shows us from time to time info about Taki or Mitsuha's personality. I appreciate it), but like, come on. He really feels underwritten and underdeveloped, and even the subtle stuff that we're shown never really gets discovered during the movie. It doesn't mean that he's a BAD character, but I feel like the movie could have dived more into his character.So, overall?I like this film a lot. I had fun watching it, it was beautiful visually, the message and motives are cool. Taki is really underwritten, which really takes this movie down, but Kimi No Na Wa. Was generally interesting for me, and I had a goot time. I'm feeling a 7.5/10 on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Overrated AF,"When I first saw Your Name, I enjoyed it for the most part. I thought the pop music montages and dialogue were pretty cringey, but overall the film was visually and atmospherically impressive enough for me to fall for it.After a recent rewatch, I was actually shocked at how emotionally manipulative and utterly devoid of substance this movie really is. I'll break everything down for this:The body swapping is a fairly generic idea, but they could have done a lot with it. Unfortunately it fails on so many levels to further cement the idea of the two protagonists exploring each other's lives and personalities, and instead the movie tricks the viewer into thinking that this actually happens. The two leads never learn about each other's lives from swapping bodies on any emotional level, instead those cringey montages that I mentioned before gloss over this important aspect that should have been more properly handled. This is also extremely problematic since we're supposed to believe that Taki and Mitsuha actually fall in love with each other, but we never find out why. They don't learn anything from living as the opposite gender either, in fact the story relies on breakage of character for comical effect. For example, the normally androgynously behaved and chilled-out Taki acts like a sporty, aggressive, manly-man while in Mitsuha's body.SPOILERS: The second half of the movie is just as disastrous as the disaster it depicted. Not only does it abruptly drop the comedic tone of the first half of the movie, but it handles disaster and loss rather badly too. It relies far too heavily on the protagonists making dumb decisions, wasting time complaining about nothing, retardedly running around for no reason, and idiotically forgetting each other's names. All this is made even more unbearable by yet another wave of godawful pop music montages and cringey dialogue.In the end there's no emotional loss in Your Name. There's no sacrifice, no learning from your mistakes, because in the end the protagonists just reverse the timeline and save the day. But now they've forgotten about each other forever? Surely there's a bittersweet ending? Nope, they get reunited and live happily ever after in the end, that's what happens. That time wasting ordeal of running around and forgetting each other's names meant nothing in the end.Even though there are also many MANY plot holes that I didn't mention, Your Name's number one issue boils down to the atrocious writing and badly thought out story and characters. I still adore the film's visuals and immersive atmosphere, but it simply falls flat as a story.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Your Name Please!,"Your Name is a lively combination of romance, identity, and culture. I went into the film with a very little understanding of the plot's complexities. From the trailer, I assumed Your Name would be an anime Freaky Friday love story. The framework of the narrative certainly fits into my initial assumption. Yet, there is a multitude of undercurrents in the film which make Your Name stand out. For starters, Your Name constantly changes themes and mood. Often, I found myself laughing and, a few minutes later, would suddenly be on the verge of tears. The movie's eclectic flow makes for a constantly engaging experience. The Freaky Friday element is roughly half of the film's two-hour runtime. In fact, a plot twist in the film literally took my breath away. Your Name is the rare film which combines overwhelming variety and makes everything fit organically. Through variety, the anime earns a conventional ending between protagonists, Mitsuha and Taki. While body switching is the plot's main intrigue, the film adds complexity through its exploration of Japanese culture. Japanese gender identity is explored with such a masterful hand. In subtle strokes, the viewer understands the sheer contrast in the lives of Japanese men and women. For example, a group of men have a crush on a female co-worker; Mitsuha, in Taki's body, simply initiates conversation with the desired woman and, with ease, sets up a date. When Taki is back to normal the next day, his male coworkers all line up disgusted by his act of group betrayal. The scene effectively demonstrates the strength of the herd like quality of gender in Japan. It's no surprise then when Taki, in Mitsuha's body, finds such humorous wonder in the breasts he suddenly gains. A contrast can also be noticed in the struggle between the past and present. The present is Taki's experience of Tokyo. Likewise, the past is illustrated by Mitsuha's familial duty to her small town's local shrine. In other words, the film merges Japanese spirituality with modern sensibilities. A desire to escape and return to the country define the film's ecliptic take on Japan. Mitsusha is your typical country girl with a thirst for a life in the city. Meanwhile, Taki finds beauty in Mitsuha's country town. The viewer amusingly experiences each setting (Tokyo and Itomori) through the unique lens of the protagonists. Ultimately, a comet and local god guide the distant figures into a surprising collision course. As a result, fate is sealed by the two somewhat metaphysically dissimilar sources. The forces of science and divinity augment Your Name into making the seemingly fated connection all the more plausible. The film is a testament of the ""opposites attract"" sentiment. In summary, the film has a real beating heart. I will end my review saying Your Name is the best looking animated film I have ever seen. The colors are always pleasingly vibrant. Additionally, all of the scenes are lovingly rendered and pulsating with life. I haven't walked out of a theatre with such a positive perspective on life in a long time. If you live in a city, you ought to take the time to experience this anime masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's okay but not THAT good.,"The movie was clearly made to be on big screen and make everyone averagely happy. The animation and emotion? I expected much more of Makoto Shinkai who was behind the art of the opening and trailer of Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two. That was stunningly beautiful animation and storytelling! Instead, you can find a more generic style in this one with loads of anime and drama/romance clichés: Cute and generic sounding voice actors? Check! Older and cool character who smokes? Check! Bad parent? Check! Wise and cute grandma? Check! Not-that-beautiful best friend? Yes! I could go on...""I'm adding shrine culture and craftsmanship!"" was also there big time. One thing that was totally absent for me was that the romance between the characters was based on...nothing.
The soundtrack reminded that of a big screen American animation but sung in Japanese. It sounded musical-like and childish at times. Plot was average to a higher level of average. It's a body-swap movie as one can see in the trailer and that's been done a lot before. However, there's a good twist which made me enjoy the movie a lot in the end, combined with other elements of the second half. I'd recommend watching on in case the first half doesn't do the trick for you. All in all, not a masterpiece or anything but watchable.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Everything I want a movie to be,"I'll be honest with you, I'm not the biggest fan of anime. Not in the sense that I particularily dislike it but rather in the sense that I haven't seen that many anime shows or movies. Of course I've seen most of the Ghibli films but that's pretty standard even for a normie like me. In terms of Makoto Shinkai I hadn't seen a whiff before I saw Your Name (Kimi no na wa). However this one reached such an unsual amount of praise and attention compared to other anime films that even I got curious after some time. Could this movie be worth all the hype? Could it appeal even to someone relatively unversed in anime?And the answer was a thousand times yes! Your Name contains everything you could ask for out of any movie, not just animated ones. Romance, heart, passion, visual splendor, suspense, humour and much more. Many of these things have been lacking in most recent Hollywood movies as they seem to be getting more and more transparent in how safe they're playing it and how unpassionate their films are. I never thought to look to a whole other culture to find all these things that I've wanted more of for so long, but here we are!Your Name is beautiful in every sense of the word. Firstly from a visual standpoint. By now I've seen quite a few Shinkai movies and they all look really great, but man does he outdo himself here! Every movement looks fluent, every colour is expressive and vibrant, every expression on the faces of the characters looks natural. The whole movies is gorgeous because of all of these things, but the final act is where it really pops thanks to the grand epic scale of what is happening on screen. But perfect visuals are nothing without a good story, and thankfully Your Name has it. You've probably heard that the premise is that a boy named Taki and a girl named Mitsuha start switching bodies inexplicably. I think you should watch this movies with a clear mind, so I won't say anymore, just know that there's more to it than that, and the film takes many unexpected twists and turns.Also I need to touch on the fantastic soundtrack by RADWIMPS. I wasn't sure if their music would work well together with this rather dramatic and lofty premise, but the music is such a perfect fit for the visuals and it always seems to exactly match the emotion that is being created by the scene. I have all the songs on my playlists now and I listen to them practically every day during my spare time, it's that good!By the end of the film I felt like I had had such a complete experience. I had been laughing, I had been moved deeply by the dramatic scenes and I had been gasping at the visual spectacle. I really do not know how anybody could watch this film and end up finding nothing to like, it really does feel like there is something here for everyone. What I ask most of all out of any movie, is to entertain me and to move me, and Your Name did that better than most movies I have ever seen. It really did give me everything I could possibly want!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly good!,Your Name isn't the kind of Anime I usually watch. I have always been into the more violent Anime movies most of which are from the 80s and 90s like (Akira). I came across Your Name while scrolling through Netflix looking for something calming to watch. I am glad I gave this movie a chance because after a bit of rocky start the story picked up and it ended up catching my interest the rest of way through.Your Name tells the story of two high-school students. The first is a girl named Mitsuha who lives in a quiet mountain town. Mitsuha dreams of one day leaving her quiet boring town and moving to Tokyo where she can explore and eat at all the best Cafés. The second is boy named Taki who lives in Tokyo he works at a restaurant part time after school he dreams of one day becoming an architect. One morning they wake up inside each others bodies with no explanation to how or why it happened but they soon discover that it's not just some crazy dream and that it will keep on happening so they decide to make some rules to stop them both causing trouble in each others lives until they find a way to stop it once and for all.The first thirty minutes or so of the movie aren't very interesting or original if your an older viewer the first thirty minutes of the movie can end up coming across as just another typical high-school romance anime with fan service at least that was my initial assessment of the movie. Then to my surprise the story picked up and suddenly went from what I thought was going to be a predictable storyline to one that ended up changing my opinion of the entire movie. There's really not a whole lot you can say about the movies storyline without spoiling it but what I will say is that the movie does have some genuinely heart warming moments of friendship and romance.The animation style is breathtaking with scenes that use a unique blending of colours to create something that's beautiful to look at throughout the entire movie.The English voice acting is surprisingly good the voices match the characters well and the ADR work is very well done. The original Japanese audio always sounds better so I recommend watching it with the Japanese audio and English subtitles for the best experience.I recommend giving Your Name a chance it's a surprisingly good anime movie that appeals to both an older generation of anime fans and a new generation.,5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Donnie Darko w/Boatloads of Sweetness Instead of Angst,"Oh, and gorgeously animated.I think that's a fair way to sum up this movie. It starts out as a fantasy and, as it reveals more puzzle pieces, you realize it's more science fiction. There are tightly plotted reasons for everything that's going on, all of which are revealed in good time.Like like all good puzzle movies, there's a thrill every time something is revealed that ties things together. It's complex enough that you want to see it again immediately, but no so complex that you have any doubt as to what basically happened.Like Donnie Darko, while it's busy scrambling your head and keeping you guessing, it is somehow managing to be deep, both emotionally and thematically (the latter drawing on Japanese culture and religion). Unlike Donnie Darko, it's never dark and disturbing in a creepy way, although there is plenty of danger and peril. Instead, it radiates sweetness and love, without ever becoming saccharine.Donnie Darko is one of my two or three favorite films of all time, so this is high praise. Of all the films I've seen since, nothing has come closer to matching its combination of thrilling revelations, emotional resonance, and thematic depth than Your Name.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Wistful, poignant and ultimately uplifting; beautifully animated and wonderfully inventive.","There's a distinct and slightly jarring protagonist switch just far enough in for you to really notice it, but it's a testament to 'Your Name (2016)' that - though it could have been ironed out relatively easily with some structural smoothing or a slightly simpler two-handed approach - this is perhaps its only real issue and it isn't even all that detrimental, considering that it allows us to develop a proper emotional connection to both leads from an internal perspective, actually mirroring the fantastical conceit driving the beautifully animated and wonderfully inventive narrative. The piece is a joy to watch and takes a number of turns that are genuinely unexpected. It's a wistful, soulful and poignant experience that's also an entertaining and, ultimately, uplifting one. It does seem to say something quite profound while always managing to delight and mystify with its deftly handled story and properly stirring themes. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Your Name: Not as good as it should have been,"I'm a fan of studio Ghibli, I believe the likes of The Red Turtle (2016) and Grave Of The Fireflies (1988) are masterpieces so I like giving these types of similar animation a chance even if they aren't made by the same people.Your Name heavily reminds me of Ghiblis work, it has that beautiful animation style and emotion driven storyline.It tells the story of two high school students, one in Tokyo and one in a small village outside of the city whose lives are bizarrely connected. The movie successfully twists, turns and fascinates but when the credits rolled I found myself a tad underwhelmed.The concept, the animation, the beautiful soundtrack, it all promises more than it delivers.Your Name is by no means a bad film, it just flounders and doesn't seem to come close to its potential. It is beautiful, it is sweet and its some heartfelt stuff but the emotional tour de force I was expecting? Hardly.At time of writing its the 83rd highest rated movie on IMDb and won 10 of the 11 awards it was nominated for.

Utterly amazing,"Makoto Shinkai is a director who I've always found intriguing. Even when I didn't care for his works I always felt there was a unique vision there, but it wasn't until 2013's Garden of Words that I felt he had truly been able to satisfactorily express that vision.Your Name, though, is the movie it was all leading up to. Once again Shinkai is concerned with distance and connection. Here, two young people keep switching bodies and living bits of one another's lives. Much of the first half of the film is a light comedy about the wackiness of such a life, but the story deepens and the movie becomes wonderfully suspenseful and touching.At this point, Shinkai has complete control of his craft. Visually the movie is utterly stunning, with absolutely breathtaking moments. The story draws you in slowly and believably.

If sappy love stories with magical realism are your thing,"With ""Your Name"" storming up to MAL's top, I had to check it out for myself and experience this phenomenon, that has a score of 9,40 out of 10 at the time of writing. With so many people agreeing, that it's a masterpiece, it has to be good, right? Well turns out I didn't enjoy it quite as much the majority of MAL users.Plot: The story starts fair enough. Our main character suffers from ""Disney princess syndrome""; she's not satisfied with the surroundings she was born in and wants to see the world, that is so much bigger than what she knows. Luckily for her, magical realism is a thing in her world as well. Out of nowhere she gets the chance to live out her dreams by switching bodies with a boy from Tokyo every now and then. The boy, turns out to be the other main character. This sounds like the basic story, in which our lead learns, that ""every place is beautiful, but home is still best"" or that everybody has troubles in their life, no matter where they come from. The set up definitely has some potential, since the main characters parallel each other in an interesting way and they're pretty well characterized. But that doesn't turn out to be the case with ""Your Name"". The writer was far more ambitious than to just recycle the classic body switch plot. About halfway the movie switches into a pretty convoluted romance story, that just doesn't work, because the whole second half is built around wanting to give the audience the ""feels"". Don't get me wrong, I like a good romance or a good tragedy as much as anyone else, but if it all feels as contrived and transparent as in this movie's case, I won't be able to jump on the feel train. The climax was a pretty interesting idea, but was pretty inconsistently build up, where things worked out way too conveniently to be believable.Characters: I've already addressed it in the previous section, that I found the characterization of the characters pretty good. With the exception of the self-absorbed and ambitious father almost all felt pretty lively. Unfortunately characters can at time's be only as good as the plot allows them to be. This shows especially with the side characters, who at times just conveniently join into the plot, even if it doesn't make much sense. Same goes for our leads, they're pretty fun at first, but as soon as the plot starts becoming contrived and convoluted, I no longer found them as likable.Art: The art and animation were pretty good, but it was pretty standard in terms of style.Sound: Just like the plot the sound was also heavy into making you feel stuff and to be fair it did resonate with me somewhat. Interestingly there were a lot of pop songs instead of the more typical choice of instrumentals.Plot: 50% (4/10) Characters: 30% (6/10) Art: 10% (8/10) Soundtrack: 10% (8/10)Score: 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

If you haven't watched this Masterpiece, Please Make yourself an offer you can't refuse... And watch this Masterpiece.""Your Name,"" directed by Makoto Shinkai, is a mesmerizing animated film that has captivated audiences around the world since its release in 2016. The story intricately weaves themes of love, fate, and the connection between two distinct worlds, leaving viewers both enchanted and reflective long after the credits roll.The film follows the lives of two teenagers, Mitsuha Miyamizu, a girl from the rural town of Itomori, and Taki Tachibana, a boy living in bustling Tokyo. Their lives take an unprecedented turn when they inexplicably begin to switch bodies intermittently, creating a unique and humorous situation that allows them to experience each other's lives. As they navigate this bizarre phenomenon, they develop an emotional bond that transcends distance and time. As their lives intertwine, they develop a deep connection and a desperate desire to meet in person.Shinkai's masterful storytelling is a highlight of ""Your Name."" The script is laced with humor, emotion, and poignant moments that resonate deeply with viewers. The pacing is spot-on, perfectly balancing lighthearted scenes with heart-wrenching turns. The character development is profound, particularly as both Mitsuha and Taki struggle with their feelings of longing and connection despite being separated by vast distances. Their journey is both personal and universal, exploring the themes of love and the quest for identity.Visually, ""Your Name"" is a stunning achievement. The animation is breathtaking, with each scene meticulously crafted to evoke emotion. The vibrant colors and intricate backgrounds beautifully capture the contrast between Mitsuha's tranquil rural life and Taki's fast-paced urban existence. The attention to detail, from the shimmering starry skies to the bustling streets of Tokyo, immerses the audience in the world of the characters, making their experiences feel tangible.The film's score, composed by the renowned band RADWIMPS, enhances the storytelling immensely. The music is evocative, with melodies that perfectly complement the emotional beats of the narrative. Songs like ""Zenzenzense"" and ""Sparkle"" have become iconic, encapsulating the essence of the film and leaving a lasting impression on its viewers.One of the most compelling aspects of ""Your Name"" is its exploration of fate and the connections that bind us. The concept of threads of destiny tying people together is beautifully illustrated throughout the film. As Mitsuha and Taki navigate their extraordinary circumstances, they grapple with questions of identity and purpose, ultimately leading to a breathtaking climax that ties their story together in a way that is both surprising and satisfying.""Your Name"" is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends cultural boundaries. Its blend of fantasy, romance, and drama creates a rich tapestry of storytelling that resonates with anyone who has ever experienced a deep connection with another person.

"a sweet, mindbending, and all around great animated film","From the crystal clear, beautifully crafted animation to the likability of the two protagonists to the tense drama to the light humor, this semi-love-story is lighthearted and very moving to the point of now being one of the most acclaimed films of recent years. And perhaps one of the most acclaimed films of all time. I had a couple of little problems w/it, thus making me avoid any statements about the film's status among cinema's finest efforts as they'd be rather hyperbolic coming from me, as well as simply just not genuine. Instead, however, I will happily praise the film on various levels. 
 As a technical achievement, it is stunning. The animation is spectacularly done in every scene, the characters are really alive, the scenery is beautiful, in general it is just a really fun movie to look at. There were a few surprisingly surreal and borderline psychedelic moments here and there in the film and they worked not only to further the plot but also to simply show off the massive tons of talent pouring itself into basically every shot of this movie. 
 Story-wise, it is also stunning. It's a mixture of a few genres. At first, it almost feels like some light slice-of-life type comedy w/a magical-realist twist, but eventually it becomes something much more emotional and dramatic than that. It becomes a film featuring multiple dimensions and complicated situations these two leads who I genuinely grew to adore and care for had to trudge their tense ways through. It is a supernatural drama and a love story on top, and a very unconventional love story at that (the way the romance of the film is handled is unlike almost any other romance I have seen; it is clear these two are in love, but they never express it openly at all). It really felt like the writer really matured over the course of writing this, which is as much a blessing as it is a curse, b/c it does mean that the film improves heavily w/every scene, but it also means that the beginning and early middle of this film are no where near as great as what follows. And, do not get me wrong, there's some super fun stuff in this roughly-first-half of the movie, but there's also a few eye rolling scenes and weird incorporations of pop songs and overtly expository dialogue and non-endearingly cheesy moments that I just could not get into. Thus, my score drops down by a single point. It is still, obviously, a wonderful movie, and sort of a must see for lovers of animation and world cinema in general.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Close to perfection,"Let me say first that this piece of art is so impressive to me that I doubt that my words would be sufficient to describe how I feel and think about it. Therefore I will try to use an analogy, so bear with me.But beforehand let me quickly mention that the formal and technical sides of this movie are very good - nothing to complain. There should not be any doubt about that. The drawings are beautiful, the animation is fluid, the colors are well chosen, the music is composed and played gorgeous.Now regarding the content: To me personally it is nothing less than a masterpiece; no way around it. It is not merely a movie it is a piece of art like a poem, like a (metaphysical) parable. It is one of the movies that are enjoyable to think about because they are complete, because they are whole - like a an organism. If a regular narrative is a line this movie is a circle. (not circular)The experiential aspect I can only describe by means of an analogy: like the tongue distinguishes a handful of tastes the soul distinguishes a handful of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, surprise and so on. Something could feel sad like something can taste sweet but that does not say anything about the complex quality behind that sweetness. Just because chocolate and bananas are both sweet does not mean they taste the same. Are you following?Likewise not every sad movie is sad in the same way. It does not have always the sadness of the same kind, it can be of a well composed kind of sadness or of a cheap and poor kind. They taste different.So applied to the movie I can say, without exaggeration, that I have never tasted such rich and well-composed emotions, feelings and thoughts in one movie. Such an exotic taste. Partially this move has something of a myth, it gives you a glimpse of the indescribable. In this case, in ""your name"", time and first love plays a role but again: in an exotic way I have never encountered before.In conclusion: Any adjectives like ""beautiful"" or ""brilliant"" would only cause insufficient associations that wont do justice to that artwork. Just like you wouldn't ever be able to feel the taste of an exotic food or fruit by the mere description you got you cannot even conceptualize how this movies ""tastes"".My recommendation is - taste and see that your name is good!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Words can't describe how fantastic it is.,"Your Name, also known as Kimi no na wa, is an anime film is directed by Makoto Shinkai and it is based on the book written by Shinkai. It tells the story of a boy named Taki, a high school boy who lives in Tokyo who out of some bizarre miracle, begins switching bodies repeatedly with a high school girl named Mitsuha who lives out in the country. The two learn about one another through various hi- jinks and need to find a way to pair up and stop something from happening.The movie was English dubbed by Funimation and came to select theaters in North America for a week and I have been dying to see this after hearing about all the buzz regarding it, and I'm not going to lie, this was one of my most anticipated films of the year. So, how did I feel about the movie after seeing it? If you couldn't guess by the rating, I loved it!The movie was incredibly engaging and I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The story is simply immersive, with many surprising twists and turns along the way that can really bring you into the experience. The mystery of the movie is an element that really drew me in, and it lead to me thinking of some questions that eventually got answered as the movie pressed on. The movie is very emotional with many scenes that will send you The interaction between our two leads Taki and Mitsuha is definitely strange to say the least, but in a good way, even if their interactions are awkward. I'm just going to leave the explanation regarding the story and characters off right here because it's hard for me not to review this particular film without talking about the film in-depth.The animation is fantastic to look at as well. The designs for the back grounds in particular really gave me a feel for what the city in the country looks like as well as what Tokyo looks like. The CGI does a surprisingly good job at blending in with the traditional animation. Even the movements of the characters look natural, as well as the environments. Even though the art style is no new anime art style, it still is a very well polished one. During one scene, the art style goes through a major change that would last for a few minutes and personally I loved the change. I loved the vocal songs that were featured in the movie. As someone who isn't a fan of modern music, I found them quite refreshing, even if they are just English dubbed.Your Name is simply a fantastic movie experience regardless of whether you're an anime fan or not. It's really easy to see why it gained critical acclaim in Japan and multiple awards. The story is incredibly gripping and our two lead characters are both very interesting and very likable. The animation is beautiful from start to finish and the vocal songs felt refreshing. I'll be honest, it was very hard to find a legitimate flaw with the movie. However, if I do have one legitimate criticism towards the film, it's that the film starts off pretty slowly and is not as engaging as it is later on. However, I can afford to forget about that since it didn't bother me that much. While it's in theaters for a limited amount of time, go see it. This film has to be seen to be believed.If I could make a recommendation however, I do think the movie is more suitable to older audiences in spite of the PG rating. I wouldn't recommend the movie to those under the age of 10 due to some suggestive themes that might not be appropriate for audiences under that age. If you do plan to bring kids under the age limit, make sure to keep an eye out for them.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Must watch for both anime and non anime fans.,"So I just had the pleasure of enjoying ""Your Name"" in the cinema and though I could share some thoughts.(May contain very minor spoilers)I've seen many movies trying to pull off the ""two people mysteriously change body with one another"", but I've never seen a movie doing a good job with it. Until now, that is. Makoto Shinkai's ""Your Name (Kimi no na wa)"" has finally succeeded at the task. With a very well deserved rating of 8.6 and 113th placing on the list of 250 top rated movies of all time, ""Your Name"" delivers us anything we could ask from it:A terrific artwork, the movie's animation is extremely well made, with beautiful landscape scenes accompanied with an excellent soundtrack; the sky, sun, water and comets are completely astonishing and mesmerizing to watch. There is even a psychedelic like animation scene halfway through the movie during a critical moment that is deeply touching. Just like in every of Mokoto's movies, the characters are extremely well constructed and it makes you fall in love with them after 10 minutes into the movie, developing a huge emotional bound to the story. The movie had a perfect balance of everything: comedy (which isn't always present on Makoto Shinkai movies, so it was quite pleasant to see it in this one) drama, romance, some mystery, all with a touch of non-linear movie structure. It's the type of movie that will make you laugh, cry, laugh while crying The movie's perspective constantly changes between the two main characters, what gave it a very touch and it's not something you see very often.For every anime fan this movie is definitely a must watch, and even for non anime fans I'do recommend to give it a try!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A bright, sensitive and spectacular anime that achieved great success worldwide.","The young Taki lives in Tokyo, the young Mithusa in a small mountain village. Mitsuha and Taki are complete strangers living separate lives until they suddenly switch places. During the dream, the bodies of both are exchanged. Mitsuha wakes up in Taki's body, and he in hers. This occurrence happens randomly, and they must adjust their lives around each other. Yet, somehow, it works. Confined in a body that seems strange to them, they begin to communicate with surprising consequences. So they build a connection by leaving notes for one another until they wish to finally meet. But something stronger than distance may keep them apart. Experience Japan's #1 film of 2016, from visionary director Makoto Shinkai !.The germ of this anime titled originally Kimi no na was (2016) was Shinkai's visit to the city of Yuriage in 2011. The municipality was affected by the terrible earthquake that devastated the region, and the terrifying image seriously impacted the director. And although the town is made up, the place is inspired by several real locations such as the city of Hida, in Gifu prefecture, which has received a tremendous tourist boost after the release of the film thanks to the continuous pilgrimages of fans who come to visit the most recognizable locations.Shinkai is known as the Hayao Miyazaki of the new generation. He directed this ""Your Name"", considered to be one of the highest grossing films in Japanese cinema and which even surpassed the release of ""Spirited Away"" in 2016. Regarding the plot of the film, the director cites the influence of works such as the manga Boku wa Mari no naka by Shuzo Oshimi, and Ranma 1/2 by Rumiko Takahashi, the classic novel Torikaebaya Monogatari and even the famous Interstellar by Christopher Nolan.The sensitive soundtrack of ""Your Name"" is provided by the Japanese rock group Radwimps, adjusting the songs to the script, but also vice versa, thus improving the harmony between development and music. Your Name does not hide its desire to be a romantic blockbuster, effectively demonstrating that a cathartic and satisfying experience can be offered with the typical elements of Japanese anime, managing to fit the elements together masterfully. The result is a brilliant and spectacular film that is perfect for beginners to get into the anime environment.This fantasy anime won the award for best animated film at the 2016 Sitges festival, Public Award in the Animation Festival of Bucheon and several awards in the Japanese Film Academy, as well as being nominated for best director and best independent film at the 2017 Annie Awards. The motion picture was stunningly annd competently directed by Makoto Shinkai . He is a Japanese director, writer, producer, animator, editor, cinematographer, voice actor, manga artist and former graphic designer. Shinkai studied Japanese literature at Chuo University where he was a member of juvenile literature club where he drew picture books. He made many commercials, and thanks to them he was able to explore new registers that helped him develop as a scriptwriter. Specifically, his work with the commercial 'Cross Road' is seen as a prototype of the changing dynamics between the stories of Mitsuha and Taki. In 1999, Shinkai released She and Her Cat, a five-minute short piece done in monochrome. His best knows films are The Place Promised in Our Early Days (2004), 5 Centimeters Per Second (2007), Children Who Chase Lost Voices (2011), The Garden of Words (2013), and Your Name (2016). His favorite anime is Castle in the Sky (1986) by Hayao Miyazaki. Kimi no na wa(2016) rating: 7.5/10. Better than average.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Whatever you expect from this movie, it will be a thousand times better!","First of all, i must say that anime and animation movies are not my cup of tea, but my gf loves them! So i watched quite a few with her. Now, take in consideration that my account is 8 years old and i never bothered to write a review on any movie.. BUT this movie surely deserves one!First things out, the movie opening with some beautiful animation and amazing soundtrack! 10 seconds in the movie, and im already 110% in it. Music is amazing throughout the movie and it massively adds on tension. I give music choice 10+Animation is done surprisingly well. Dancing parts are top notch. Running, talking. Everything looks so smooth and amazingly done. Characters are quite believable and you'll love every single one of them. Even the side ones that show only for a few seconds. Their dialog is neat for as much as i could understand it. 10 for animation and characters.Now the story. It reminded me of Life Is Strange, which is probably my favorite game of all time ( even the music choice was similar ) because it has so much story and character involvement. And this movie succeeded in every aspect of character development, but i must say that story was redundant at some points. I dig sci-fi parts of it, but movie could've ended sooner than it was the run time and it would still be an amazing movie. It's like they needed some scenes just to fill the run time. NOW, don't get me wrong, story was excellent, it keeps you rooting for protagonist/s all the time. You'll feel sad at the time, you'll laugh, you'll be mad at some points.. there'll also be some ex-machina-ing. But overall, i give 9.5 for story.Overall 10/10. A movie you must watch if you haven't.

Watch this like your life depended on it,"For two whole weeks my students have been telling me about this anime, Kimi No Na Wa (Your Name), begging me to check it out. Over the grapevine I also learned that it is the first non-Ghibli non-series based anime movie to earn over 10 billion yen. So last night we did and I have to say it is truly one amazing entertainer with intelligence to boot. It was so good we felt so lost what to see next and so we didn't. We wanted nothing to ruin the unique experience.I will spare everyone the synopsis and plot details because the experience of going into this totally blind is roller-coaster-fantastic. What I will just say is writer-director Makoto Shinkai took some great risks with the narrative and it pays huge dividends in terms of storytelling. This is not something you can sit back and let the story do all the work; you will need to constantly think about what you are seeing, as well as where and when it is all taking place. I love it when a director respects the viewers and brings the game to me. After the electric pace gender bending opening act I have no doubt that like me your mind will throw up the direction of what the narrative will take. You and I would be so wrong. I was gobsmacked at every twist and turn the narrative takes which subverts all my expectations. Shinkai also does a monster mishmash of so many genres that I didn't see when the romantic euphoria ended and when the detective procedural began. He even embeds an element of horror and melancholia. All through this widely imaginative ride he knows where the beating heart is - the relationship between the two star-crossed lovers separated by time and space.Above everything else, the anime captures something so elusive so beautifully. By elusive I mean the temporal seconds you were waking up from a sweet dream, your entire being is still consumed by last night's dream and the memory of it immediately dissipates as you step into the waking world. However, the essence of the dream continues to envelope you throughout the entire day like a cocoon; you will try to hold on to the remnants unsuccessfully. Name one film that got that magical quality spot-on. Shinkai's Kimi No Na Wa got this right many times over. Everyone needs to grab your loved ones and watch this like all your lives depended on it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
What Begins as a Cute Movie Evolves into Something Much More,"Your Name. follows a boy and girl who randomly begin to switch bodies, and how their relationship develops through that.There's a lot more to this movie than I can say, because around the halfway point everything changes and it becomes much more than a simple feel good movie. And that's what it is for the first third. It's quirky, fun, cute, all that. It's not great, but it's really enjoyable.The second that aspect of the movie ends the movie begins its quick ascent to one of the best movies I've ever seen. It builds the characters and their relationship well and by this time we're already attached to them well enough, but then something happens. There's a huge plot twist in this movie that, put simply, blew my mind. And moreover, made me tear up a little. From there on it just gets better and better, writing-wise.The movie doesn't just have a great story though. For starters, the animation is beautiful. And it isn't just pretty paintings and scenery (though there are), the imagery is also unique in some scenes, where what is being shown isn't completely natural but it looks cool anyway. At the same time, it isn't just mindless artsy- fartsy crap, it actually has relevance and symbolism and stuff.The movie's soundtrack proves to be quite good too. A song plays every once in a while, and all of them are well-suited to the movie and just sound nice. I don't think I'd listen to them outside of the movie, but I like them nonetheless.Something that really stood out to me was how realistic it could be. Sure, it feeds off of plenty of things that would only happen in an anime world, but it doesn't rely on those. The characters act in realistic ways and say things you'd expect them to say, all without removing the anime charm entirely.I always think it's cool to see a movie with a few confusing scenes, then see everything come together at the end, making all those scenes make sense. Your Name. has plenty of those. There are scenes that you kind of just forget about but then they come up again later and you realize that this was all thought out well before the movie was made, and it really shows just how much effort was put into the movie in the first place. It's clear that it's trying to be something more. It's trying to be complex, and it actually is. The movie isn't too terribly hard to understand, but it does require you to think at least a little to fully get it.Overall Your Name. is an anime that excels in every aspect of it. The writing is fantastic, the characters are fun and lovable yet realistic, the soundtrack is well-suited, it's beautiful to look at, and it makes you think just enough that it isn't overly confusing, but enough to still make it complex. In the end this isn't just one of the best anime films, this is one of the best films I've ever seen, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to just about anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Reasonably interesting, but not great","A teenage boy living in Tokyo and a teenage girl living in the country experience a strange, random phenomenon. They occasionally switch bodies for a day at a time, and then can't remember what happened while they were switched. The boy eventually sets out to find the girl, but the situation may be even more peculiar than he imagined.Reasonably interesting, though not overly engaging and quite schmaltzy. The switching places plot device didn't seem too original, reminding me of movies like Freaky Friday, and was often just a basis for silliness. However, once the plot progressed past the cheap fun part, the plot gained some intrigue. It didn't quite live up to its potential in that regard, resorting to clumsily layered cleverness and random departures to create a feeling of ingenuity, when this was really more style than substance. Still, did make it fairly interesting.Unfortunately there is a whole lot of trite schmalziness and empty sentimentality too, probably because the movie is aimed at the teenage market. In the end it feels a like Freaky Friday meets Christopher Nolan, dumbed down for teenagers. By aiming for a broader audience and avoiding the schmaltz, this could have been great. Instead it is just okay.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"6.5, alright to watch once but not rewatch","I overall enjoyed this movie, but after hearing great things it fell flat. Even if I hadn't had any previous knowledge of this movie I still would find it underwhelming.PROS: A decent anime film for people that don't have anything better to compare it too. It's inoffensive/family friendly and enjoyable enough. The natural backgrounds and cityscapes in the film were gorgeous. Once you watch it you won't have to wonder what all the hype is about.CONS: Some of the ideas in the movie presented themselves as if they'd be really complex and interesting, but everything played out in an uninspired way. The two main characters were supposed to be in love, yet there was barely any development there. We never really saw them get to know each other or understood why they even felt anything for one another. There are ways this movie could've done the soulmate trope without making the relationship feel under developed. Also I found the character design to be unappealing, and the random breaks within the narrative to deliver mini music videos seemed like a weird editing choice.If you're looking for a fresh emotional movie with complex characters and an interesting love story this is not it. Watch ""A Silent Voice"" instead. Or any Hayao Miyazaki film.TL;DR: just okay, kinda nice but lacks real heart.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A beautiful experience with an astonishing finale,"This is a very good film, but it takes a while to reach that level. Although providing an entertaining fantasy first act revolving around the pair's body-swapping, it takes a good fifty minutes for the film to develop into something truly great. Moving from enjoyment to stunning emotion, Your Name is ultimately an enthralling and powerful tale, one told with great visual beauty from Makoto Shinkai.Shinkai, the director and writer of the likes of The Garden Of Words and 5 Centimeters Per Second is being dubbed as 'the new Hayao Miyazaki' by his third fantastic outing with Your Name. Undoubtedly, Shinkai is on a very similar level to Miyazaki when it comes to his visual style. Mixing the images of classic landscape paintings with some exceptional photo-realistic macro-focus shots, there's no doubt that Shinkai is a master of anime when it comes to pulling off pure visual beauty.Also, the second half of the film is evocative of a great Miyazaki picture. I'll get into the specifics of the latter half in a minute, but suffice to say at this point that Shinkai definitely has the ability to match the likes of the great Miyazaki when it comes to bringing across both blissful and devastating human emotion, something that's always even more powerful in animation.Before I get into that, however, I want to talk about the first fifty minutes of Your Name. Initially, the film shows real promise with the way it handles the body-swapping genre. Rather than solely making silly comedy out of the situation, it's full of some fascinating and brilliantly original ideas, cleverly blurring the line between the teenagers' dreams and anxieties and the real world.When the film is more dramatic and thoughtful, it's always engrossing, testament to Shinkai's expert writing. Unfortunately, there are moments that really stick out like a sore thumb, and prove the reason why Shinkai isn't yet quite up to Miyazaki's level.For one, there are some striking tonal inconsistencies throughout this film, particularly around the half-hour mark. Frustratingly, there are about two or three musical montages throughout that make the film feel like a TV movie, and each time they appear, they're more and more jarring, proving a hugely disappointing break in the film's generally impressive elegance.I understand that Shinkai has his own style, but his previous films haven't ever used so many of these montages. They're frustrating to see, and as they're all book-ended by awkward fades to black, they are undoubtedly the worst moments of the entire film. Happy, lightweight and enjoyable they may be, and they would definitely work in another movie, however they prove so inconsistent with the film's best tone that it really sticks in your mind.Despite that, the following hour or so is spectacular. Stepping up from an interesting but not always emotionally riveting first act, Shinkai dramatically turns the film into an emotionally stunning and powerful experience, with so much poetic elegance and sheer unpredictability that you can't look away from the screen.It's difficult to discuss the second half without spoilers, but the way that the film manages to grab you so much by taking such a drastic turn, moving away from the fantasy of the body-swap to an incredibly human and tender story, Your Name is definitely worth the wait to get to the best bit.Overall, I was hugely impressed by this film. It may not have the most consistent opening act, but the way that the film does provide some amazingly thoughtful and ultimately emotionally powerful moments is truly spectacular. Coupled with Makoto Shinkai's incredible visual style, Your Name is a fantastic movie, and one that definitely reaches near the legendary heights of Studio Ghibli.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Inspired by forces beyond human understanding,"I feel like this film was divinely inspired. It is beautiful, yet otherworldly. Without even trying, it hits hidden chords within the human psyche that bring out a torrent of feelings that we never knew we had, or had long forgotten about.When I watched it with my friends, who are normally chatty and sarcastic during movies - they were completely silent, awestruck immersed wholeheartedly. They were quiet, save for a few ""wows!"" at the beauty and detail of the art in this film.When the credits came, they were still so enthralled they just watched the credit roll, without moving or wanting desperately to rush back to their busy lives and schedules.

Great little film to watch if you want an emotionally engaging experience,"#Spoiler Free This film could very well be Makoto Shinkai's best film to date. The films excels in creating heartfelt smiles that can turn to tears at the drop of a hat and back again. Similarly to many of his previous works his stories may seem a bit generic and lacking, however this allows the viewer to really focus on the characters and the emotions between them, rather than being caught up in a twisting plot. We are also gifted with Shinkai's train metaphor, however this time unlike 5 cm per second, they show the protagonist journey diverging down separate routes and coming back together all while moving in the same direction to the eventual end of the line.The two protagonists are Taki, a boy from urban Tokyo, and Mitsuha, a girl from a rural Japanese village. Shinkai takes to dull husks and embellishes them into a pair of protagonists with personalities and traits that make them relate able and lovable. The characters chemistry is extremely entertaining and really grows throughout the filmThe beginning of the film succeeds in quickly establishing the characters and there morals, all while creating an attachment between characters and the audience. The films also succeeds in changing pace and direction as soon as things start to get repetitive, allowing the viewers attention to always be grasped and leaving them wanting more. The films fantasy spin keeps things fresh and prevents the film falling into generic slice of life clichés.The art like all of Shinkai's other works it breathtaking, making the film stick in the minds of the audience for long after the films over. Thanks to the detailed artwork the locations and backgrounds are well fleshed out and eye catching making it seem like real life location and not a poor imitation.The soundtrack is done by Radwimps, a Japanese alt rock band, that breathes life and emotion into scenes due to their wide range of styles and atmosphere.Overall i enjoyed the film thoroughly. The fantasy spin really clicked with my tastes and caused me to be engaged and entertain throughout. I also quickly fell in love with the characters and their chemistry together and due to being a similar age related to them both. Thanks to it being one of Shinkai's more happier works i'm now left with a strong desire to watch it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

It was ridden with clichés, and oh my god did it drag on. This film would have been better as a 1 hour feature, not a 2 hour epic of dillying and dallying.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ranks among the best animation has to offer.,"""Your Name"" took a while to get an American release but so anticipation for this film has been rising. Especially since so many say its great!The story centers on two main characters living in Japan whose lives are closely connected. Taki and Mitsuha are both teenage students who wake up in each other's bodies and begin to grow as characters and in their appreciation for each other by living their lives.By far the most astounding aspect of this film is its story and beautifully constructed narrative. The story structure manages to keep its audience on the tip of their toes to focus while never losing itself in convolution. Makoto Shinkai has managed to craft a beautiful story that both touches the heart and makes you laugh out loud (considerably hard at some parts). This blend of drama and comedy make this piece both deeply and emotionally resonating, as well as undeniably enjoyable.The animation itself is a thing of beauty. If anyone has seen the trailer, they know this movie offers beautiful and captivating animation from the very first shot.Hopefully, this film will gain traction in the U.S. considering it truly is one of the most breathtaking film experiences I've ever been a part of. It's become a personal favorite and is definitely the kind of movie that should be praised and seen by as many have the opportunity. Definitely give this a good watch and bring kids to see it too (maybe a bit older kids)!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I don't like it very much, the plot is very common","There are many highlights. Unfortunately, after shaking off the burden, the core turned out to be an old stalk of a vulgar and hypocritical girl in love. The last subway interlaced to recognize what really made me stale. The so-called ""your name"" is terribly overworked, and it is embarrassing in the end. ""Qian and Qianxun"" also talked about ""your name"". Qianxun was forced to erase his name and became Xiaoqian. Xiaobailong retrieved her name. The meaning of the name here is a positioning and return to self-existence, a reflection on the question of essence and ontology of ""who am I"". And ""Your Name"" doesn't say anything, it is a pure girl love anime movie, and it deliberately consumes the girl's heart. The gap is so great that I can't compare the two movies.
On feelings about nature and tradition, they disappeared completely in the later period, and they were top-heavy. Instead, they felt indifferent. Not to mention comparing with Hayao Miyazaki. No matter which movie Miyazaki made, he never deliberately portrayed the feelings of men and women, but none of the men and women is not impressive. Parker and Hida in ""Sky City"", Little White Dragon and Chihiro in ""Thousand and Thousand Seeking"", ""Hall's Moving Castle"" and Hal and Sophie, etc.
Even if it is the emotion and description of the town, compared with ""Little Forest"", it can see a huge gap. After all the scenes turned to Tokyo, the town did disappear.
On the love of girls, it is not as good as ""The Girl Who Traveled Through Time and Space"". The flirty sentence ""I am waiting for you in the future"" is more touching than this repeated deliberate ending. On dog blood hypocrisy, it is not as good as ""My Girls' Generation"", at least hearty, sweet and sweet. ""Your Name"" used the safety of life in a small town to accompany the two to fall in love. It was really depressing. This is too deliberate, too hypocritical, and too hypocritical. Probably I am not young enough.
In the final analysis, the expectations are too high. As far as the films directed by Xin Haicheng are indeed, they are much better than those of the movies he had before, but they should be as good as possible. The Chinese public is too easy to be pleased, and a little jokes are enough to satisfy. A bit of flirtatious sex teasing will make you happy for a long time. In fact, the whole movie's laugh point is almost supported by touching the chest. Maybe it's been a long time since I saw a good-looking anime movie in love. But really, I would rather watch ""Listening to the Ear"" a hundred times. If it's just about falling in love, then have a good time and do so many tricks. Even if you focus on the theme ""I've been looking for someone ... we all had an adventure, met someone I liked, but just forgot his / her name"", it's better than a hodgepodge in the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

I could not even remember when was the last time I watch a movie without checking my watch, which means that every single minutes, from beginning till the end, the scenes were very enjoyable and well fit in to the whole flow of the story.This movie also reminded that how great Japanese movies in Asia were before Korean movies started coming to scene.

This is one of movies that left me speechless ! I've been shaken, it instantly made me impressed and deifying it. I praise this movie in an apex ladder board. Forgetting this movie for the rest of your life is just infinitesimal chance. I've been eroded and impaired by its visionary, beauty, and emotional form.What a zeal, Makoto ! Here he comes ! Praise the luck oh people, we found a new movie professor here. We found a predecessor of Miyazaki, an anime-making skill similar to him. Well maybe now we can call Makoto is paternal to Miyazaki, but maybe moments later reach in peer or surpass. Praise the lord, this is Japan, a new born history-maker has arrive. I write this as a rite of his advent.This movie has a very strong impact to its viewer. Makoto combine sci-fi and drama to bring affection, love, tension, and thrill. By its form YN is incredibly complex. It plays the plot forth and back and connect it slowly but surprisingly impetuous. You could never guess anything in YN because Makoto wrap the story neatly and unwrap it in the right time and structure. All that you get only a shake in your body knowing how beautiful and twisting the story is. This is one of the most original movie this year, and the originality seems bonded to its viewer by its memories and visionary idea.

A breath-taking visual treat with a story that will reverberate within you for some time,"A late contender but strong contender for one of the best films I've seen in 2016 and maybe even thus far. (I've never starred a film before but by God this one deserves it!) ""Your Name"" is a feature film Japanese anime so it's for those who can tolerate foreign films and animation. And by animation I mean painstakingly breath-taking animation that goes from encapsulating almost photo-realistically vibrant sunsets to the slightest twitch in expression giving soul to the characters before us.I'm not one to judge anime but I'll say this: of the little I've watched, never have I seen such detailed artwork, animation so real and voice acting so fitting that the characters are so alive that you genuinely wish that they were. The consistent top-notch animation, artwork, soundtrack, directing and even the voice acting was clearly done with love and care to the point that the finished film looks and feels like a passion project without a deadline striving for perfection.Oh and it's not just looks too it's got brains as well. I was hooked on the plot from the beginning and although I can't comment on the amazing plot without ruining it, you should expect a drama/romance/fantasy. I guess you're just going to have to take a leap of faith here... Even if the plot sounds a little 90s.It was a spectacle to watch unfold, it made me laugh, it made me cry, it had me fully invested from start to finish and most importantly, it made me feel. I don't think one can ask for more in a film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Emotionally moving love story,"I don't often write reviews but I don't remember the last time a movie made me tear up so much. I felt like the characters at some points 'overrun with emotions' and with subconsciously teary eyes. 
Everything in the movie was brilliant, the animation, the scenery and most of all the plot. The themes through the movie were strong, such as the talk of the threads of time or the ribbon, and much of the plot that at the time didn't seem very relevant came back in a way to remind the viewer. The ending was elusive too, I wished that they would remember each other and meet but weather they would or not remained uncertain.
I won't spoil what happened but I can confidently say its one of the best animated movies I've ever watched and I've watched several. Many of the themes felt similar to 5 Centimeters Per Second and if you liked that movie you'll definitely like this one.",,Anonymous,Animation
A somewhat hollow piece of media,"For those that is about to destroy me for the headline, yes, I mean it (I am not sorry). When I finish watching it, I walked out feeling ""Huh, that felt like literally nothing"". It was strange and alien to me how people can even shed a single tear watching this movie (it's not wrong to do so, I just couldn't understand the idea of doing so and yes, I did cry watching other anime before). The movie is artistically stunning and all of the aesthetic were wasted on a story that feels badly stitched together by somewhat decent characters and an okay climax. It's not bad per se but I think that it deserves too much credit for doing so little. In conclusion, it's fine if you like the movie but if you think too hard while watching, it will ruin your experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Makoto Shinkai's magnum opus and one of the most intelligently written pieces of entertainment Anime has to offer,"I had high expectations for Your Name. Not only because I have thoroughly enjoyed Makoto Shinkai's previous films, but also because it has been doing incredibly well at the Japanese box office the past few months.While I think Shinkai's previous films are great, none of them quite reached masterpiece levels for me, but I'm very happy to say that Your Name did that, because not only is this without a doubt Shinkai's best work to date, this is easily one of the best Anime films I have ever seen.I don't want to go give away too much detail about the plot, but all I will say is that this is an incredibly written and very original story, with fantastic animation (as you would expect from Shinkai), along with lovable characters, funny humour, a great music score and a final act that will surely have you waiting to see what transpires with deep emotional investment.What starts off as a funny body-switch comedy turns into something much more deeper and emotional in the 2nd half, but I won't give anything away!It's now one of my top 5 favourite Anime films and I encourage everyone, regardless of whether you're an Anime fan or not, to check out this masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The romance doesn't feel believable and isn't explained well.Things I like: I really like the art style, especially how a contrast between city versus rural. The music is quite fitting.

"Your Name is phenomenal, so close to perfection.","Suffice to say I used to hate anime, I couldn't get on board with it. Now that I feel I've grown as an aspiring film critic, I can appreciate the delicate art of Japanese animation. With Hayao Miyazaki retired, is the genre deceased? Far from it. Your Name is just as good as any Miyazaki production. Two teenagers unexpectedly switch lives, forging a connection that is both unexplainable and unforgettable. Having figured out what's happening, the two attempt to meet...but not everything in life is that simple. A gorgeous juxtaposition of culture and gender. A country girl and a city boy. A tranquil and picturesque rural town against a bustling and modernised Tokyo. Contrasting the difference in mannerisms and punctuality, not just in lifestyles, but in gender. How a girl and a boy interact with others differently. Two lives being thrown into a foreign environment. The sheer complexity and magnitude that the narrative conveys is nothing short of genius. The introductory title song plays and BAM...I was captivated instantaneously. The animation...the animation!? It was like watching art move right before my eyes. Anime has never looked so beautiful. The glistening water, fast moving transport, hallucinogenic comets against a starry backdrop...wow. Wooooow! I can't. It's too much. I think my eyes are bleeding, someone pass me a tissue. Shinkai's direction was utterly creative. The story moves along at a swift pace and the inclusion of time-bending realities just makes it that much more intriguing. It's a love story. How love can traverse both space and time. Honestly, it was beautiful to watch. To create a pure relationship from two souls switching bodies is...well damn difficult. Shinkai made it look easy. Some of the time-bending narrative shifts can be confusing and you may not necessarily understand it in one viewing (heck, I didn't completely) but the film is that good, that you will want to watch it again...and again...and again. Aside from some exposition, Your Name is masterful.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

magical realism,"A comet is approaching. Mitsuha Miyamizu is a 17 year old high school girl in the small town of Itomori. Her dad is the mayor and she's tired of her small town life. Her friends complain about her behavior the day before but she doesn't remember. She wishes to be reborn as a boy in the big city. Her wish comes true as she wakes up in the body of high school student and part time waiter Taki. It's like a dream as they inhabit each other's body.The animation is beautiful. The story is imaginative. The characters are lovely and compelling. There is magical realism to the movie. The plot does get a little jumpy which does fit the style. I would be more interested if it's cleared up a bit more. The movie climaxes at the impact and it drags out the ending a bit. Taki should have encountered Mitsuha at that point. Her father could be dead and she would be on top of the hill tending his grave. The searching in Tokyo is poetic for a little while but at some point, I just wanted it to end the movie and the ending is never in doubt.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

beautiful but a bit predictable,"I don't usually write reviews, but I feel like I need to say something about this film, even if the majority of reviews will be overwhelmingly positive. And I'm pretty terrible with these things b/c I don't have a photographic memory.Anyhow, it's a story of boy and girl switching bodies after a cosmic event involving a comet that's never really explained. This happens a few times each week, much to the chagrin of each of our main characters and amusing fun for the supporting cast. I don't want to say much else beyond that without giving away plot details. Needless to say, they start to fall in love with each other as they're living each other's lives.It's a beautiful film. There's one particular sequence in the middle that I absolutely loved visually.The movie started to fall apart towards the last 30-45 minutes once it rushes to resolve a problem introduced in the latter half of the film. It feels like the film needed a bit more running time to avoid this. There's also a bunch of suspension of disbelief required...I mean I guess this is to be expected, but for me, a films starts to lose me once there's too much serendipity involved to resolve everything.Also, I think the film would've gotten better mileage if it had gone down the bittersweet route when rushing to its end.I left the theater liking the film, but it's not like it's the most amazing film I've ever seen (even if it broke the box office record in Japan), nor did it really leave me with tingly happy feelings like after watching some Studio Ghibli films.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very touching love story with sci fi elements.,"I really loved this film and that surprised me since I am not an anime fan in general. But, I am a love story fan. I was a little averse to the subtitles at first but once I started, it was easy to watch and really get into it. There are features in this film as deep as some of the most deep ones in American love stories and sci-fi. The concept draws you in immediately and if you pay attention, it starts to flow and flow and what a fun ride it is.It uses some elements we have seen in a new way and the anime really helps to that end. I have to tell you that after about 5 minutes in, I forgot the characters were animation, they seemed real to me.I found the two main characters charming. Again, I am not much of an anime fan. I have seen many of them but they aren't my first choice. This would not only appeal to young lovers, like maybe those in love for the first time, but it will also rekindle those adolescent/young adult feelings in anyone who gives it a chance.If you examine my history at IMDb or my own sites you'll see I am not new at recommending films. Take it from me, this is an instant classic. The artwork is also way above the usually anime bar. Some of the special effects had to be done by paintbrush, or by hand however they did it. It was a feast for the eyes and the story did not suffer.Having said all that, if you can't give it your attention or you really have no interest to sit and watch subtitles, this probably isn't for you.Give this film your full attention as a love story with some sci fi elements and you will not regret it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A very pleasant surprise!,"I'm not used to write movies' reviews but this one deserved with huge merits. After read other reviews, I encouraged myself to do the same.

Although I watched the Spanish dubbed version, the dialogues kept the main essence of the story and the characters delivered a wonderful performance. The visuals were magnificent, for both environments (Tokyo and Itomori). The premise of the movie seemed quite simple and repetitive, but I didn't see this coming. My wife and I were in suspense until the very last minute of the movie. It is a must-watch definitively.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Magical,"When the movie started, I was a bit disoriented, as the first few scenes had fast cuts, and I hadn't been grounded yet. There is a lot of time travel and this does get confusing throughout the film, but I wasn't very bothered by it. I'd say that the constant time shifts actually add to the mystery of the story, as you're always trying to figure out where in the timeline you've jumped to.The animation is great, with vivid colors and great lighting effects. I can't imagine how difficult and time consuming it is to make graphics look realistic. I just enjoy the finished product. Very detailed work. I think there is more of a 3D depth to anime than there is with cartoons. Just something about their technique gives it so much more aesthetics. Or perhaps it is also the vast range of colors that are used.The story keeps you guessing as it progresses, and that's what makes it so magical. Anything can happen next, and you don't see it coming. I was thoroughly invested with the story and found the script to be both comedic and culturally aware. The two main characters are quite different from each other, but both are headstrong and their stubbornness is fun to watch.Overall, this is a great fantastical film to watch, for both the old and the young.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Watch this movie.  You probably won't regret it.,"After years of browsing this site, I finally broke down and registered so I can share my opinions with strangers who probably won't care about or even read what I write. But then again, in the past I've used these reviews to help make a decision whether to watch or pass on certain movies. As the best movie I've seen in years, Your Name seemed like the right one to start with. I'm not going to attempt a technical, elitist analysis, as I'd probably just end up sounding like a pretentious moron. I'll just try to hit some key points.As a disclaimer, there's only about 3 directors that I consider myself a fan of, and Makoto Shinkai is one of them. I've seen all his films and enjoyed them to various extents. Your Name is different from all his other movies and, I would say, is his most complete film. The most notable difference is the tone. Whereas most of his works are much more somber, this one has a lighter, comical side that offsets the deeply emotional moments making it more accessible to a wider audience.To be fair, this movie has some flaws. There's a few logical gaps that you just have to ignore for the movie to work. The main characters aren't overly interesting in their own right, and few, if any, of the side characters are developed throughout the film.However, what this movie does well, it does exceptionally well. It is definitely a story-driven piece and the story is deep, interesting, and well-told. I'm not going to mention anything approaching a spoiler. I went in with almost no knowledge of the plot and had a more rewarding experience because of it. I will say, though, that if the first 30 minutes or so seem a bit silly for your taste, stick with it. It gets better.For those wary about getting into anime, this is a good one to test the waters with. It's absolutely nothing like the bits of Pokemon or Dragon Ball Z you may have accidentally glimpsed over the years. I've seen both the Japanese version with subtitles and the English dubbed version. If possible, it's always better to watch a movie in it's original language, but I know not everyone can handle subtitles. The voice acting for the English dubbing is passable. It's not perfect, but it probably won't ruin the experience for you.I tried to be as objective as I could in rating this movie, but there's really no such thing as true objectivity with something so emotionally driven as the film industry. This movie is a personal 10, but I feel that 8.5 stars (rounded up to 9) is an accurate rating.So, anyone reading this who is on the fence about watching this movie, here's one more random person urging you to give it a try.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Beautifully animated, well built story","Having seen other movies (Garden of Words, 5 centimeters per second and Children Who Chase Lost Voices) from Makoto Shinkai, I've been prepared for the visual masterpiece that is Your Name, but the well built, interesting story was a pleasant surprise.While his other movies were a bit slow or uninteresting for me, this one managed to get pacing and plot right, and was successful in keeping my interest, and managed to build a smart story from the corny body-switch basics.I'm hesitating between 8 and 9 stars, as I've felt the story could have been a bit more complex, and there were some plot holes, that are not so easy to overlook. I'm giving it an 8, but a strong 8...Stop reading, and just go see it already, it's worth it (japanese dub + subtitles).",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Heart, Soul, Beauty and Art","What a great movie, story and moving art.

Shinkai goes feel-good anime!,"Among all the other works of Makoto Shinkai, I must say that this is undoubtedly my favorite.This is not as slow as 5C/S. It has the rhythm that perfectly blends with the lighthearted music. I must also mention how I love the random quick frames and some more symmetrical shots. Aside from the animation, the movie's plot and tone offer such an engaging story. I like this Shinkai's story-telling style. It is not rushed. He takes his time to reasonably develop all the characters and every situation. He makes animated romantic stories not an isolating genre to watch. Although, again perhaps the love story is just but a secondary part of the whole story.While it is categorized as sci-fi fantasy, it is also sprinkled with a slice of life touch and that's another thing I enjoy watching in some Shinkai's movies. It is unpretentious. The mundanity is not torturing but it is something that you savor and love.Everyone should see this. It's a perfect movie for fall. It's lovely!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful animation with an amazingly overhyped mess of a story,"The animation quality of this movie makes for some really dazzling moments of enchantingly atmospheric cinematography.However, regarding the story itself the movie seems ridiculously overhyped to me, like all the 9s and 10s here have never seen a decent Anime movie.The movie starts with a body swap-premise but completely loses its focus in that one halfway through the story in order to switch into a Deus Ex Machina time travel mechanic that overtakes the plot by becoming the key to prevent a town's destruction by a comet.^This is a very constructed/artificial way to suddenly increase the stakes of what started out as a grounded slice of life movie with a body swap premise.This new focus on time travel and ""we must save the city!"" undermines the connection between our protagonists as most of their common time is now not spent on understanding each other, but on trying to understand the rules of time travel and swapping.Thus, the identification potential with those two drops significantly. Shinkai's later movie Tenki no Ko (which is BY FAR superior to this one in my opinion) shows how character focus should be executed in the long run.So ultimately, all the 9s and 10s here feel really superficial to me.A perfect score requires perfect character development.And unfortunately, Kimi no Namae ha really has not much to show here beneath its beautiful animation.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Amazing !!!!!,"What a beautiful movie and what an amazing story very minimal yet so complexe ( some christopher nolan animated shit lol), I am so pumped, first time an animation movie makes me wanna visit a country lol this film is an epopé, it explores different deep themes that we can't explore in one review , it's an epopé about our search for meaning, the signification of loveand identity; a movie about that deep longing for something or someone you can't quite grasp, the yearning that haunts you and leads you to find the remedy for the hole in your heart and find love or meaning, I guess that's what the movie is about. I love how the characters change for the better after knowing each other Mitsuha became more confident and serene thanks to him and Taki became more empathic and calm thanks to her they're both opposites still they complete and elevate each other, a beautiful illustration of what love should be. already a classic and I don't get the Oscars snub!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Not bad, but...","The movie, in general, is good and entertaining, but being strict, its plot is totally disappointing.
It's visually stunning, nothing more, nothing less. It lacks an actual message and it has plenty of unnecessary scenes which seem to be there just for the sake of teenager fanservice. It isn't dramatically touching either. Just another pointless interpretation of the already seen body-switching concept.
It's certainly overrated. Sadly, it's a total waste of visual resources. Hadn't it been for its popularity, I would already have forgotten about it.
I'd actually give it a 7.5 out of 10, but I'm rating it a bit lower to compensate for other reviews which depict it as the best anime movie ever.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best Anime Movie For A Decade,"This movie brought me a conditioned reflex as it has made me could not help tearing up even if I just hear the soundtrack of it. It's too perfect to pick a single flaw ,no matter its animation , story and emotions. To be honest, it was not that incredible for me at the theatre where I watched it for the first time. However, with more reviews , understandings and captures of details, I gradually generate a brand new impression to this masterpiece. The most beautiful and emotional scene of the entire movie is the moment when Mitsuha discovers that Taki wrote ""I love you"" instead of his name on her palm. It's going to be pitifully ruined if someone watched it in dubbed version without the subtitle of the text on the hand.

Inevitable,"Have you ever watched a movie for the first time and thought it was 'just good', but once you rewatch it, you finally realize that it's not just good, but near perfection. That's what happened when I watched Your Name. At first I just liked it because I had to constantly read the subtitles and understand the plot. But later on, I watched it for a second time, and started paying attention to certain details, like the animation, the performance of the voice actors, the likable characters, Japanese culture, but the best and most impressive one of all is the music by Radwimps. Their songs go so well in every scene in this movie, especially ""Sparkle"" in the final moments of the film. And that is one of the main reasons as to why this movie is a ""Masterpiece"" in my eyes. This movie is without a doubt the best animated film of all time, with Spirited Away a close second. It's such a shame that pathetic, lazy people from Hollywood just take ideas like this and start making their own versions. In the end, it doesn't matter, Disney will always be in the shadows of Japanese Anime. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I have had some primitive and conservative thoughts that they are fools who get involved in cartoons. But I found out that I was wrong only after watching the movie Inside Out. Since then, I have tasted a few dozen anime films. But I had never seen a movie like Your Name.
The concept of the film is amazing. The film manages to entertain as well as inform. The story is extraordinary. This is a visual treat for the eyes.

It is all tied-in with the lives of two people who live far from one another, but have a destiny to meet.I love it when the media of anime is combined with mature themes that can be enjoyed by the whole family.Definitely recommended for anime fans.

"A Beautiful, Lovely Film, pulled down by it's weak ideas","Kimi No Nawa is one of the most beautiful looking Films, my little eyes have ever witnessed. The pleasing hand drawn animations are absolutely eye-catching and impressive. The direction of photography is phenomenal and the musical score is stellar and comforting. The film's concept is pretty alright and is executed in a fairly proper way. What brings down the holistic feel of the movie, is it's kind of boring character traits and the way their arcs go. It doesn't have anything all that substantial, as much as it has in style. It is not even close to being as profound as it thinks it is, and it is easily his weakest work in terms of writing. But, Still, Kimi Are Nawa is a lovely, beautiful film, that is entertaining for the most part and has some of the best visuals and music you'll hear in a film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
stunning visual effects but that's all,"This movie has drop dead gorgeous/ stunning visual effects, however the plot is confusing and the ""teenageyness"" was just too annoying. The scenes where the characters become aware of their different gender parts is really strange, not amusing, just weird. There's not enough plot. I felt completely drowned by the visuals and the music. (I actually paused the movie in order to search for an option to silence the music and only hear the dialogue, to no avail. Perhaps I would have liked the movie more if I could have accomplished this.) I was desperate for meaningful dialogue and deeper character development. If you are interested in anime you'd be better served to watch the following: Ponyo, A Letter to Momo, When Marnie Was Here, The Secret World of Arrietty, Vampire Hunter, Howls Moving Castle, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, Castle in the Sky, Princess Mononoke, and My Neighbor Totoro; to name a few.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than most hollywood productions but not without any errors,"This movie is amazing. The plot may have been inspired here and there but it's something completely new in it's entirety. The scenery and art style is very dreamy and make me wanna go to japan. Also the soundtrack is very fitting and adds to the atmosphere although some people might be annoyed by the japanese singing, but it's a japanease movie playing in japan so what are you expecting? There might be some logical holes that make you think like: ""Hm, why didn't they just do this instead? That would've been much easier"" but it's nothing major so if you aren't even paying close attention to the story, you might even notice. Another problem with this movie is thar there are many time-lapses which probably explains why many of the bad critics are complaining about the sudden romace between the characters. It didn't quite come clear when and how they fell in love due to the shortness of the movie and the timelapses where they probably got closer. Without these negative critic points I'd rate it 10/10. All in all it is a great romantic movie with a twist that is very emotional and hypnotizes with its atmosphere that is created by the lovely and detailed art style and the music. You can't watch this movie coldhearted and with a negative attitude towards japanese animations or you'll miss out on its magic. Thank you for reading!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The visuals are fabulous, literally not one single bad shot. The soundtrack was absolutely moving and fits soooo well. The characters are of course brilliant and are the one of the key parts of the movie, they have such strong chemistry between one another but are unable to fully show it as they cannot meet. This get even more challenging towards the end where it just keeps getting better. The plot, omg, was so good. Every piece is split at the start and is connected at the end.

Peculiar,"Maybe it is because I don't like fantasy films in general, or that I am either blind or apathetic to the intriguing, warm story which plays out. Maybe this is why I didn't thought much of the critically acclaimed Makoto Shinkai masterpiece Your Name.In terms of writing for a fantasy film, your name is excellent. It is alternately sweet, soulful, and satisfying, while engaging the audiences intrigue for this unusual alternate-timeline body- switching plot line. But therein lies my problem with this particular execution of fantasy- it may well be too fanatical, too foreign to me. It feels as if the screenwriters were making things up as they go. There is no set ups in this film which pays off later- we are not offered any explanation for almost all the events in the film(like why Mitshua and Taka disappear as suddenly as they appear on that mountaintop), or the precise mechanism of the body switching process. The film, doubtless, has an emotionally resonant, powerful storyline, but it may feel confounding in this respect.A second gripe I have is with the dialogue. I find that when I watch a foreign film, the foreign language throws me off, for I do not understand the subtler inflections and tonality which express emotion in these languages, making me ambivalent to deciphering emotion through speech. Perhaps that is not a complaint with this film specifically, rather with films not in English for me. The film is however beautifully shot, perhaps not as photorealistic as Shinkai later feature Suzume, but overall still very enjoyable and sumptuously pretty.I will admit to not having enjoyed many fantasy films for they have a tendency(as in this case) to gloss over its mechanism of action in favour of taking us on an adventure. My favourite fantasy films are those which are set in a realistic world, but contain fantasy elements, the mode of action of which are thoroughly explained and demonstrated in the film. Think Midnight in Paris and the time travel mechanism. Maybe this is why Suzume, a film which takes you for a ride, fails to resonate with me much. While others enjoyed an ethereal experience, fully invested and immersed in the two lead characters, all I saw was a warm, sweet story which I didn't care for much.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lifechanging!,"Well,i can not use any Emotional Word to Describe This Anime and I do not Want My Review to be The Best. But Honestly This Anime Changed My Entire Life, Yeah Maybe Some Of you are Saying That : Yeah this Anime is Great, But it is not that good to Change Someones Life. But Let Me Tell You The Story of my Life Then You Can Judge me.I Was born 15 years Ago in Iran. I had a Difficult Childhood,I Mean Emotionally. In That Rough Time I Learned Nobody Cares For me, Even my parents. And Since My Parents were Religious, So I Learned That There is no One for me in this World, So I Have to Be with God To Find The Real Peace.I Was Growing with This Attitude That God is The Final Peace. But Last Summer Things Became Tough For me, And Frankly I Could not Find The Inner Peace, so One Day, Out of nowhere, I Thought Suicide Is The Best Way To Find That Final Peace. Well Thinking Of Suicide Was Kind Of Sweet. But One Day I was In Imdb website that i Saw a News About Your Name. Everybody suggested This Anime, And said This is great and you have to watch it.Well First I Thought it's like Other Animes that Finally Two People Love Each Other and That's it. But Frankly I Believed That There is a Soul Mate For Everyone but Mostly They Do not Find Each other.Anyway, I Thought maybe it,s good for my soul and it can Heal My Heart. Then I Downloaded it and started to watch it. When i Finished watching it, i was totally a Different human. there was a Hope in My Heart That Says: You will Find Your Soul Mate, Be sure. and The Strange Part is I Found Her, I Found My Soul Mate.Yeah That,s True, one Day I Was Thinking About Suicide Now I'm Thinking How Can i Marry her and Live For Her. And Also Exactly Like This Anime, When Something Happens For Her, I Quickly understand That.

"if you know your anime, don't expect too much","To be sure, ""Your Name"" is now at a domestic B.O. of $140 million among the 50 most successful traditionally animated films of all time, it establishes Makoto Shinkai firmly as the new great hope of animated film, and it does feature the most brilliant lighting effects ever produced. If you don't know any previous works by Shinkai and his company Comics Wave, chances are you'll be blown away. If you are, however, familiar with his work, you may catch yourself wondering what all the fuss is about.There isn't anything new here - the intertwined time-lines were the main feat of his ""5 Centimeters per Second"" (2007), and the asteroids and fantastic themes dominated his debut feature ""The Place promised in our early Days"" (2004), which I personally hold to be his best work.Why then this sudden enormous success? Well, Miyazaki has stopped directing, and Ghibli has been on hiatus for two years. The equally brilliant Mamoru Hosoda's films have topics more domestic to Japan, and because of this his latest film ""The Boy and the Beast"" had only a limited US release. I'd still say that his ""Wolf Children"" (2012) and ""The Girl who leapt through Time"" (2006) are far superior to Shinkai because of their complex story lines, and because you can watch those over and over again. His style is also more reminiscent of Miyazaki.But right now, it's Shinkai's hour, and to be sure, it's well deserved that he finally gets so much international exposure. Only I very much doubt that he will be able to replicate this success, because the novelty first-time viewers may experience now will surely wear off if he sticks to his well-established themes.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

At its heart a love story yet managing to encompass so much more,"I was not familiar with Makoto Shinkai prior to this film, but having watched it I want to go and explore everything he has ever made. Because this film is easily on par with the best I've ever seen from Japan. The visuals, the characters, the depth of storytelling, the outlandishness of the central idea.The story goes that two Japanese teenagers, one a country girl longing for Tokyo and the other a city boy searching for a direction in life, start to exchange places as they go to sleep. The girl inhabits the boy's body for a day and vice versa. And as they try to solve and understand this mystery, the oddest possible long distance romance starts to bloom.And if that was all, it would be a lovely movie in its own right. The characters of Mitsuha and Taki are both excellently realized. They both act and react to this amazing situation very realistically and are both filled with personality. And it's not romance at first glance. How could it be? They clash, they argue, they mess with each other's lives. But from that fire an understanding starts to emerge and in the end you totally buy that these two would be perfect for one another. One of the best on-screen romances I've ever seen.But the thing is, the movie is so much more than that. It's about the life in the rural Japan versus that in the city. It's about being young and undecided. It's about friendships and those long summers before a major shift in your life. They even throw in a great action mystery towards the end, without it in any way taking away from the central story. Quite the opposite in fact. The mystery actually explains and solves many of the seeming inconsistencies in the story.Plus the visuals, the score, all the technicals. Superb, grand, majestic. Studio Ghibli will always be my favourite for its old time charm and the beauty of its hand-drawn craft, but Shinkai comes as close to that impossible standard as it is possible to come with computers.Though, if I had to nitpick, I would wonder why the film needs a pop song number in the middle of it. But that's the only crack the film has. The only one.Your Name is a wonderful film. It takes numerous strings, plots and characters and seemingly without effort weaves from them a story that is as true and will remain as true as the life it's imitating. Highly recommended for all.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A Rare Gem, Beautiful on the Inside and the Outside","Gorgeous anime in which a big-city teenage boy and small-town teenage girl swap places at night and affect change in each other's personal lives (just as soon as they've finished exploring their new bodies). The plot starts out fairly generic, but takes a twist in the middle that rescues it from ho-hum mediocrity and transforms it into something greater. It's very Japanese, in that both main characters speak in rapid-fire bursts, enunciating their every thought in a dreamy, poetic monologue, which alternately works for it and against it. There's a level of spirituality and self-discovery, too, that's left silent but constantly present, and a message about how important it can be to get in touch with the male and female aspects of our personality. Beautiful on many levels, not the least of which is its raw visual splendor. It's one of the most staggeringly lovely animated films I've ever taken in, stealing my breath with almost every scene; in many cases, I cursed myself for not speaking fluent Japanese because my eyes spent so much time on the subtitles. Both the rustic landscapes of a small, classical Japanese village and the crawling steel chaos of downtown Tokyo are fantastically rendered, sharing both a stunning aesthetic and a sense of warmth and familiarity by the closing scenes. A fresh, wonderful, touching tale with a little something for everyone, I'd dare to rank this with many of Studio Ghibli's finest.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

""Your Name"" is also a very beautiful love story.Overall, the only reason i'm not voting it higher is because i was a bit lost near the end.

An Extraordinary Heartwarming story of all time,"This movie is mesmerizing and meticulously made.
All of the graphics, scenery, effects, plot, and characters are all perfectly made.The title ""Your Name?"", is genius, which also is intriguing. The plot is perfect. At first we are brought to a story where the two characters live their life on a bizarre way. It shows us how they're living, who are separated very far away. Each of minute will made us intrigued of how these two main characters will live. The plot will make us as if we know them well and understand each of the character's feelings and problems. At first maybe we already would have guessed how this movie will go. But when 'that suspense' show up; which you will not know when you're going to feel that; you will be mind-blowned as well as burst into many feelings. Happy feelings, heartbreaking feelings, heart-warming feelings, all packed into one.The interactions between the two main characters are really unique and funny, yet lovable. There's also a lot of comedic scenes and dialogues in the movies, as well as the breathtaking scenes. 
The graphics, the scenery, are breathtaking. You still can imagine how the scenery will look in real life. Even you may wonder how beautiful living in the town where one of the main character lives.It's such an experience to watch an animated movie of this kind. There's no experience of the perfect combination between graphics, effects, characters, story that filled with many of emotions, in Non-animated movie.

A Tale of Transcending limits and emotions.,"YOUR NAME proves to be much more than a generic coming-of-age love
story. Firstly, it's the clever use of two timelines, intertwined and
overlapped, to achieve a rendezvous for the two protagonists. Secondly,
the animation and music are so exquisitely used to accentuate the
general aesthetics of the film, that it keeps the viewers' gazes glued
to the screen.The movie was recommended to me by a friend, and I hadn't expected to
be blown away the way I did. The film is a clever mix of core romance
and subtle comedy, with a tint of highly bizarre storytelling which
keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. I believe, above
everything else, the script and storytelling rocks it for Your Name.
The crucial importance of culture and heritage, the metaphorical use of
'twisted braids' as time, and the contrast between the Tokyo life and
Itomori life, are undebatable winners in this one.I had said YOUR NAME is not a 'Generic coming-of-age love story'. No
its definitely not. Rather its a modern Love story unfolding with
transcending limits and emotions.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Joyful Shinkai Film,"It was in the middle of my first semester in college when I got the chance to watch this film. It was a nasty and gross winter day. I expected the usual melancholy love story which Shinkai had did in his prior works. However, after watching this film I felt joy and happiness resonating in me and in a way enlightened my day (I watched it in the middle of the day).This film's joy is routed in its soundtrack, story, and visuals. The film's soundtrack done by Radwimps, fits the tone and setting of the story so well. It has a nice mix of rock and classical music within soundtrack. The story is also very well done. I found the story even though basic at its roots to be very dynamic. The visuals, like usual, are stunning in this film. The backgrounds especially are truly breathtaking. Also, the character designs are a lot better than in his prior works. They are not great but they are better. Another interesting aspect of the film was its tone. The tone was really light heated compared to the rest of Shinaki's works that I have watched.Some issues I had with the film is that the characters could have been more developed. I did enjoy the characters, but characters like Taki are given little character development and feel some what run of the mill. Another huge problem is the film's plot holes. A minor, but not too noticeable issue, is the pacing. During points in the film the pacing felt a bit odd.In conclusion, this film might not be masterpiece, but I still think it is a great watch. It is definitely the best of Shinaki's films (so far) and is personally one of my favorites. I highly recommend watching this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

There is no suspense, no anticipation and no character development.The typical anime character are present here and everyone is expendable to the story, which is a mess. The intrigue is without substance and won't entice a shred of interest on behalf of the viewer.

"It was very beautiful, but also quite derivative","Watching the trailer I thought this is going to be like Voices of a Distant Star or the myriad of similar anime since. Same nice scenery, piano music, long space and time communication , the touching of two people's souls (of course, high school boy and girl). And it was! Up until half of the movie. Then the original idea of the script kicked in and saved the story. I have to say that for people who have never watched Japanese anime this should be quite beautiful, but for long time fans it touches all the right buttons in a sort of mechanical and predictable way.It is a very beautiful romantic fantasy, but it sure felt very derivative. I know nothing is truly original, but as the movie ended (in a quite predictable manner), I wanted a little more - I don't know what. Perhaps more than the cardboard characters or the dusk lit countryside scenery with the piano music. The only interesting character for me was the senior waitress from where Taki worked. The rest were all the childish Japanese cliches that you see in all the anime.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful,"Ok, this is my first review of a movie, so maybe I'll be brief.The story is very well written, it just somehow feel like it does make sense. Kudos to the writer!The art is very well made, I don't find any awkwardness in every character's movement and interaction, it just feel so natural. Well, maybe that's just the standard quality for a good Japanese anime.The scenery is very beautiful, it somehow catch the very much of Japan in its depiction of Tokyo and the rural image of small town in Japan. I'm not Japanese myself, but I've been to Japan quite some times, and it feels very nostalgic to watch the scenery in this movie.The soundtrack is very nice, the music is very heartwarming and just click very well with the love story in the movie.Overall, I highly recommend this movie not just for anime lovers, but also for everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Visually Stunning but Emotionally...,"""Your Name"" is a visually stunning anime film with a captivating story about two teenagers who find themselves inexplicably connected through dreams and body-swapping. The animation is breathtaking, and the film's score complements the visuals perfectly, creating an enchanting atmosphere.However, while the movie is good, it didn't quite reach the exceptional level for me. Despite its widespread acclaim and the emotional responses, it generates from many viewers, I didn't find myself moved to tears. The story is engaging, and the premise is unique, but it didn't resonate with me as deeply as I had anticipated.Overall, ""Your Name"" is worth watching for its artistic beauty and intriguing plot, but it might not have the profound impact on everyone that it has had on others. It's a solid film that's visually impressive, but it didn't quite hit the emotional highs I expected.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A beautiful film with a band blasting their music into your ears.,"Probably due to how lame and unentertaining these types of movies are, I tend to avoid movies that involve body swaps like a plague. What Shinkai Makoto did here with the story really was impressive as he added a bit of a twist to it and making a very cohesive and entertaining story. Makoto has a very unique style from the other current Japanese animators by providing films that are absolutely beautiful to look at, such as the landscapes and sceneries. He mixed these beautiful scenes with a surprisingly interesting story by having two interesting characters and for us to see them experience what is going on as they constantly swap bodies back and forth. I liked how the movie doesn't focus on certain tropes and used the comedic moments effectively. You understand who they are and end up liking both of them by the end of the film. Also, the twist that I've mentioned earlier is surprising and introduces a stake for these characters to overcome. This is where the emotional part hits extremely well as you end up cheering for them and you hope that everything will work out with them in the end.The voice acting was surprisingly good, especially as the actors who voiced the main roles are not professionally trained voice actors. Both Kamiki Ryunosuka and Kamishiraishi Mone gave so much personality to their characters and were able to act emotional and funny when it was needed.Not everything I have to say is positive as there were a few things that did have me not enjoy as much as other people have. First off, as much as I liked the characters, after a certain point, the movie takes a comedic route by going into a montage and the film skips over a few consequences or ends subplots that were introduced at the beginning of the film so quickly to the point where it felt like it wasn't necessary. I wanted to see more of a conclusion, instead of a quick scene to show to know that some problems are resolved and will never come back.One of the major complaints is that parts of the film felt like I am sitting at a park, enjoying the scenery with someone dear to me, when suddenly, a band pops out of the bushes and starts singing their songs a couple of centimeters away from me. The band, Radwimps, did a great job and made a good soundtrack. However, just like in a lot of Japanese films and dramas, they tend to go very melodramatic and they add the music at the right time to sell their soundtrack, along with forcing people to feel a certain emotion. I instantly got annoyed when they started the movie with an anime style opening and would blast up their music so high that I couldn't focus or hear what the characters were saying. This would happen constantly throughout the film to the point that it got distracting and I wanted to plug my ears until the song had finished.Despite what I said, I'm pretty sure there are people out there that don't mind those kind of things and they would enjoy the movie more. I personally don't like and still enjoyed it overall. I'm glad this movie was a big hit as we will be able to see more top quality animation from Makoto.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A stunning work of art, in both animation and storyline","This has become one of my favourite anime ever. Not only was the storyline AMAZING and made me cry, but the detail into the animation itself is beautiful. I admit that I was skeptical at first, but it wasn't long into the movie where I had really gotten into it. There's also a lot of information to take in, so I would suggest when watching you pay full attention so you don't miss anything (not that you'd want to).
I was also very pleased with the ending. I'm not going to spoil anything, but i know how much a bad ending can ruin an entire film, so I'll just say that you'll be satisfied.

A memorable work of art.,"Undeniably one of the greatest anime films I have seen. And certainly up there when it comes to films in general.The extremely rich and developed artwork was visually stimulating and engaging. Intoxicating the viewer immediately at the incredible detail and colors emanated throughout the film.The plot was very touching and quite emotional to see play out. The way this film presents the story and incorporates themes of love, time, and wonder was phenomenal. The way everything weaved together was interesting to watch from beginning to end, and ultimately served for a greatly enjoyable and at times very emotional experience.There were humorous moments, there were sad moments, and other moments of adrenaline and suspense. The main characters themselves were interesting and instantly relatable for me, causing me to identify with and care about them as the story progressed. The way that their relationship with one another develops and the journey they embark as everything unfolds is well-done and quite memorable.There are a few twists and turns, and even though many people would have an idea of how things would play out the film nonetheless does a masterful job of gripping the viewer and making them enjoy every second of it. The twists that occurred were thought-provoking, as was the entire concept and what the film was trying to say in general. This is truly a memorable work of art for me, and one that I heavily recommend not only to anime fans, but film fans in general.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Shinkai's gem at par with Studio Ghibli's best,"Given that Studio Ghibli is in hiatus in creating its own production (it has collaborated in the film ""The Red Turtle"" this year 2016), I thought that it will take time before we see another animation gem from Japan. Well, it's refreshing to find out that we soon have another animation on a level at least at par with one of Studio Ghibli's best outings.It didn't really get my attention at first since it seems that it's like your typical teen movie about young love or another so-so film with outrageous story-line -- taking note of the body swap plot. The first part is apparently absurd because what just happened is that they have swapped bodies, which might be just another layer of a character's dream or might be the actual thing that is happening in the story. That ""absurdity"" made me curious; and given the edgy editing, interesting characters, and funny dialogue, I was immediately hooked until I get even more intrigued because it seems predictable but at the same time it seems exactly the opposite. Well, I'm happy to tell everyone that it did impress logically and creatively speaking. The welcomed confusion from the beginning was totally paid off by a transcendental revelation, making the whole experience -- with the sky, the comet, the thread of time, the music, the tragedy -- like a dream in itself. After that high point, I didn't really bother how it is going to end because I found myself cheering already on how did things unfold with substantial originality.Although I find the ending conventional and a bit melodramatic for me, and also the first half quite uneven in style, I think I have found another animation gem just like the first time I discovered Studio Ghibli's gems in the past. This film reminds me of Studio Ghibli's ""Whisper of the Heart"" combined with the creativity of ""Inception"", and the sophisticated plot of ""Interstellar"". We might not see another full-length feature from Hayao Miyazaki anymore, but cheer up because we might see another one from Makoto Shinkai. Hopefully he will rise in the same heights as Miyazaki, and he doesn't have to be the next Miyazaki, really, because ""Your Name"", as Shinkai's breakthrough at new heights, is something different and compelling in a different way.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Long distance fantasy relationship becomes great love story!,"This is a movie that does not look like much at first; nothing fancy or groundbreaking, just the fantasy of a small town girl who wishes to change her life. And then, it just happens: seemingly at random, she shifts bodies with a teenage boy, and a relationship starts. As they get to know each other, the feelings show and something settles, until suddenly, it all stops. No more exchanges, and the boy starts forgetting. All that remains is a nagging feeling that he is looking for somebody, but does not remember her name... This movie is beautiful in its simplicity, and the emotions it brings up. It does not try to explain the why and the how, but rather to make the viewer feels. And it succeeds. While it could be considered slow at times, each moment contributes towards the evolution of the story and the ending. Very much worth a watch!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the best stories you will ever watch,"I watched this movie when it was released on Netflix mostly because of all the reviews praising so much. I didn't knew the director, studio or whoever was involved.
From the first minutes, I became amazed on such a fresh and original ""situation"" (not gonna reveal spoilers), but the premise was good enough to make a decent, funny anime. Yet, when the movie goes on, you are presented with a way more complex, intriguing, breath taking moments, not to mention the last 20 minutes, which literally will have your heart pounding and probably crying
The characters are extremely well developed, the scenarios are excellently drawn, animated, the soundtrack for the most comic/dramatic events...everything is just excellent.

Yes overall it IS pretty good but....,"Lets jump straight to this.First half - engaging. It is refreshing to see the two person exchange their lives/bodies and watch how the people surrounding them are affected by the change. Eg. After the girl goes inside the boy's body she helps him ask his dream girl out.Second half - tedious. The love story. After the 50 minute mark it all boils down to some clichéd love story. And worst of all is it drags on and on. Audience are forced to sit through 40 minutes of teenage love where one person is chasing the other relentlessly and with great desperation. I nearly stood up and yelled out ""Just STFU and move on you stupid cow!""!!!!90% of the audience were Asian teens. During the film I heard a lot of laughter at jokes that were outrageously unfunny. There was a part where some cute dog appeared on the big wide silver screen and from the audience came this overbearing ""awwwwwwww' and in this I could detect the shrill voices of teenage females and males who wish to impress. That is not a problem, I am not trying to be mean in ANY sense. But these people might be the INTENDED TARGET AUDIENCE and where the majority of the reviews are coming from.

Your Name is a fantastic escape into a dreamlike world that shows us the beauty of our own,"Ever since its conception, storytelling has been used as a means of escapism. With its characters and settings brought to life in another reality, we are able to be transported from our everyday lives into something more spectacular. At its core, Your Name is all about this idea of escape. From its whimsical storyline to its otherworldly atmosphere, the entire movie feels like a fantastical dream. And an absolutely incredible one at that.STORY - 8.2/10While it takes place in the very real setting of modern-day Japan, the story is packed with supernatural elements. Just like a dream, you start off not really knowing what's going on. But soon enough everything starts to naturally unfold, managing to consistently maintain interest in its entire 2 hour runtime. There are also some really well done plot twists and moments of tension littered throughout, which I honestly wasn't expecting from a high school romance movie. On top of all that, there's a solid layer of depth that explores our connections with the world and the people around us. There are of course some minor flaws, like how explanations for the supernatural elements are mostly brushed over. But while it's nothing groundbreaking, Your Name's storyline is definitely a fascinating one from beginning to end.CHARACTERS - 6.5/10If there's a weak link in this movie, it'd have to be the characters. They aren't bad; in fact the personalities and interests of the two leads Mitsuha and Taki are explored quite well in the beginning of the movie. But there's really not much depth to those personalities, which leads to some shallow character development from both. Similarly, the supporting characters feel just like supporting characters - nothing much more than devices to move the plot forward. Having said all that, the movie somehow manages to really make us care about its characters. It's tons of fun to see them go through dreamlike journeys of their own, much like the audience's own dreamlike experience when watching. Their feelings start to become your feelings. Their desires become your desires. This was especially true for me near the end of the movie, where I wished with every fiber of my being for a happy ending for the characters.ART - 9.8/10Though its story is largely supernatural, through its visuals is where Your Name truly leaves the boundaries of reality to become something else. The hand-drawn art is stunning, and every single frame of the movie is more than wallpaper worthy. The animation is buttery smooth, with everything flowing, bouncing, or panning in the most satisfying way possible. The cinematography is breathtaking, utilizing ultra wide shots to create a massive sense of scope and beauty. And the movie is filled with visual symbolism in every nook and cranny, adding even more meaning to an already rich story. All of these aspects combine together in the best way possible to create a dreamlike atmosphere nothing short of ethereal.SOUND - 8.7/10The soundtrack only helps add to the atmosphere, beautifully complimenting every scene that its used in. Some tracks that particularly stand out are ""Sparkle"", ""Zenzenzense"", and ""Again to Goshintai"", all of which give me chills on demand. A minor complaint is that the soundtrack mostly just sounds pretty without adding much meaning to the story or its characters, but its still plenty enough to elevate the entire movie to a higher level of emotion. There are also some great sound effects that really help add to certain scenes, like a dramatic bell or a chorus of wailing whales. There's a particularly amazing scene which uses complete silence to turn something already spectacular into a borderline masterpiece. And as you'd expect from a fairly high budget movie like this, the voice acting is on point and does not at all detract from the immersion.OVERALL ENJOYMENT - 9.2/10I've said it before and I'll say it again, this movie feels exactly like a beautiful dream. Every time I watch it, I feel truly disconnected from the real world and absorbed into one more beautiful, innocent, and happy. And at the end of the day, that's exactly why I watch anime, go to movies, listen to music, or consume any type of media - to feel a sense of happiness that I can't get from reality. And in this sense, Your Name is an overwhelming success.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
an enchanting journey,"FIrst off let me start by saying I'm not familiar with any works of this legendary Ghibli and their works, nor Shinkai Makoto's previous work to compare this to any of that product. I'll simply write this review as someone who has seen the movie and find it enjoyable.As someone who has seen some Japanese animated works, I can say that Kimi no Na Wa is very well done. It is not your usual cartoon, there're so much dynamics in the picture and note that the landscape are very beautifully drawn and it really has very gorgeous scenes from time to time.The voice actors were brilliant, and I strongly suggest you see the sub version rather than the dub (I don't know how the dub will be done but the Japanese voice actors is nothing sort of amazing, especially considering that they have to voice a boyish/normal girl and a girlish/normal boy throughout the movie).The plot is relatively simple, but some twist make it very special. While it's true that this theme of girl and boy swapping bodies is not entirely new, Kimi no Na Wa elaborate it more: showing the anxiety and enjoyment that the two have without abusing it's sexual aspects and in turns build a unique bonds between the main protagonists which make their struggle to find each other more meaningful.The feeling of Japanese culture can be felt throughout the movies, with traditional symbols, such as ceremonies, braided cord, the shrine, forest, and also with dialogues, but it never felt boring as they are very beautifully paced.The music are well composed, and well timed. They bring so much emotions to the scenes. I have never heard anything from RADWIMPS before but they were brilliant on all singles they have on this movie.Anyway, it was a very enjoyable ride, and satisfying experience for me. It's a pity I have never got the chance to see it the 2nd time. If they release a blue ray, I would try to get my hand on it. Also, I'll recommend anyone who watch this search for the novel as well, it describes some of the characters' thought that the movie can't show.It's not really 'perfect'. There are some part of the plot that seems questionable, but for all it is, Kimi no Na Wa is a beautiful and enjoyable emotional ride, it will enchant you through it's 100 minutes duration.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Your Name: An Animated Masterpiece,"Makoto Shinkai's Your Name is my third favourite animated movie of all time, only being surpassed by Kaufman's Anomalisa and Miyazaki's Spirited Away. It is a masterfully crafted film that tells a simple story that manages to be fresh, intriguing, and beautiful throughout the entirety of its hour and fifty-two minute runtime. Shinkai somehow takes an idea that has been done a million times and gives it a fresh, new take that hasn't been done before. Some people will call his films melodramatic or petty, but what some people see as pretentious, I see as a stroke of pure genius. I am not only going to discuss why I believe that Your Name is masterclass filmmaking, but why Makoto Shinkai is a legend in the works. Firstly, I am going to go over my history with the film, and my initial reaction to seeing it.The first time I heard of Your Name was back in late 2016. I watched a movie review on the flick from one of my personal favourite film critics, Chris Stuckmann. I've always respected him and trusted his opinion, as we share the same fondness for movies and have a similar taste in film. I was quite surprised when he gave Your Name his highest score, an A+, and recommended it highly. I was very intrigued by his synopsis of the film and immediately sought it out. To my dismay however, I could not find the screening for the movie anywhere. Since I couldn't go see it in a theatre, I decided to wait for the DVD release of the movie, which was in April. I put it on my IMDB watchlist and patiently waited until I got my hands on the film and got to finally watch it. I didn't know much about the film going into it, although I was excited to see it, I deliberately kept myself as far from marketing and discussions on the film as I prefer to go into a movie as blind as possible. When I did get to see it, not only did Your Name meet my expectations and live up to the praise, but it did something more. Something else I didn't expect it to do. It wasn't only a good film, it was a phenomenal one. My hopes for the movie were quite high, and it still managed to be even better than I originally thought.Your Name starts with a fantastic scene that hooks the audience immediately after the movie starts. It's a scene that on first watch doesn't really make any sense, but upon revisiting, the movie, it is foreshadowing for the twist and end of the movie; the end is in the beginning. The next scene follows a girl going through her daily life, but everything seems off. Even though you've never seen this character, you still understand that there is something strange happening from hints from other characters and the girl's reaction to them. Shinkai puts the viewer inside of the shoes of this girl, in which we are in the same confused state as this girl. This makes the first scene feel like a dream which I am pretty sure is what he intended. The same scene is repeated, but instead it is a boy. We eventually learn that the boy (Taki) and the girl (Mitsuha) are actually swapping bodies, and they try to live their lives as the other person would want them to but there are conflicts. This makes for some really inventive and unique humour that gives the film levity. Later in the flick, the plot twist is revealed and it really works since it is not only creative and unexpected, but as handled really well. You feel the impact of those events on the characters, as well as the audience itself. On paper, this film has been done before, but execution-wise, this movie really nails it.Your Name is an idea that we have seen time and time again, but thanks to Shinkai, it has been done fantastically. Everything about this movie is great, from the animation to the cinematography. I'm going to go over why these things and are as great as they are. Firstly, the animation. This one is pretty self-explanatory once you see the movie. Every single shot is drawn gorgeously, especially the scenery. Shinkai is proven time and time again that he knows how to make some great looking backgrounds, and this film is no exception. This movie uses both hand-drawn and CG animation, and they are both used expertly. There isn't a single frame where I thought they were being lazy or not trying, the animation is on par with something like Studio Ghibli. Everything from the character designs to the scenery, looks phenomenal. Secondly, the story. I've already gone through it, so I won't say much other than it could have been a terrible movie, but thanks to Shinkai, it doesn't suck total balls. Next, the cinematography. The cinematography was pretty good in this movie. Even if it didn't blow me away, it was still really good looking. There were a lot of interesting shots in the film that weren't just for show, but actually had some meaning behind them. I really enjoy when directors add those few extra layers for film fans to dissect. That brings me to my next topic--the hidden meanings in the movie. As a big movie fan I love having more to chew on after the movie is over, and having to rewatch it to get everything. Some of my favourite movies are The Holy Mountain and Synecdoche New York, films that have tons of symbolism and need multiple watches to get everything. However, you can still enjoy these movies even if you don't understand everything, which is why I love them so much. Your Name may not be as deep as these movies and have as many layers as those movies, but it still has enough that analysing the movie is still a fun task. Finally, the score and soundtrack are absolutely breathtaking in this movie. This is one of my favourite japanese musical compositions in a movie since Hausu. I adore the music used in this movie and listen to it constantly. The music was done by a group called Radwimps, and although I haven't listened to their other music, I definitely want to check them out at some point. Those are the best parts of the movie. I didn't cover everything like the voice acting or characters, but that's because, though they were also good, they weren't as great as the other aspects of the movie. Nevertheless, there is still one more thing I would like to cover, that being the man behind the camera, Makoto Shinkai.Makoto Shinkai is an absolute madman. He went from making short films by himself to directing feature-length movies in the span of just two years. For comparison's sake, Hayao Miyazaki worked in the business for almost 20 years before his first feature. Shinkai isn't just really lucky, but also very talented and creative. All of his work that I have seen of his been pretty outstanding, even though I haven't seen all of his work. I really enjoyed Voices of a Distant Star, but I especially really liked both 5 Centimeters per Second and The Garden of Words. I still have yet to check out The Place Promised in Our Early Days and Children Who Chase Lost Voices, but they are really high up on my IMDB watchlist and I am really looking forward to watching them. People say that Shinkai could be the next Miyazaki, and to that I say, ""Yeah, maybe."" Even though he's not currently working on a new project, I seriously can't wait to see what Shinkai cooks up next.In conclusion, Your Name is a masterpiece in terms of film making and if anyone other than the man himself crowned the director's chair, it probably wouldn't be nearly as good as it was. In short, Makoto Shinkai is a goddamn legend.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Incredible Anime Film,"I happened upon this film just last night. I was planning on seeing a different movie, but changed mind when I saw the poster at the movie theater as I am a Japanese anime fan in general. And ""WOW"" is all I can say about this film. Born and grew up in Asia I have no problem with understanding the cultural symbols flashing through much of the film. It would be a cliché of me to describe how beautiful the production is and how vivid the pictures are. What captures me most is the poignant emotional connections between the film characters as well as with audience like me. The film's story line evolves from a devastating catastrophe caused by meteor shower, but out of it emerges compassion, courage and strength. It is more than a sci-fi movie, it is a movie of humanity. I highly recommend it and cannot wait to get a copy of the BR disc as soon as it comes out.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Beautifully animated, touching, and funny in all the right places","Your Name is an anime film written and directed by Makoto Shinkai (5 Centimeters per Second, Children Who Chase Lost Voices, and The Garden of Words). Based on Shinkai's novel of the same name, this film once again showcases the writer/director's ingenuity for telling a poignant story while also featuring gorgeous art and animation.In the rural Japanese town of Itomori, high school girl Mitsuha dreams of a better life, in particular, that of a young successful Tokyo boy. One day, Mitsuha wakes up in the body of Taki, a high school boy living in Tokyo. Initially treating the experience like a dream, Mitsuha (in Taki's body) lives the life she has always wished for, at least until the day is over. However, Mitsuha soon discovers that she actually can periodically switch bodies with Taki, and that everything she does as him happens in real life but just like with dreams, her memories of these events quickly fade away with time.Beautifully animated, touching, and funny in all the right places, Your Name is another fine entry into acclaimed anime writer/director Makoto Shinkai's expanding filmography. Only somebody Japanese could tell such a carefully intertwining story in such emotional detail. The film is very reminiscent of other body-swapping movies such as Freaky Friday and Face/Off, but with a unique eastern influence untouched by the hands of Hollywood. The Japanese voice acting is great and everybody delivers their lines with just the right amount of feeling without seeming too sentimental or sappy. I have yet to see the English dubbed version, but I plan to do so in the not-too-distant future.I rate it 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Touching and stunning,"I am not a huge anime fan. But this movie is one for everyone, it is a must see. The visuals are phenomenal, music is catchy and the story is heartbreaking. The story is about a boy who switches his body with a girl he does not know, but not for always only in some periods. There are so much funny situations, but all in one its sad and depressing. I would suggest the movie to all anime enthusiasts and who love the visuals.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The best love story, and movie, I have EVER witnessed. Literally",I'm truly speechless. I don't know what to say other than what I wrote as a title.Truly the best love story of all time. Emotional. Moving. I can't describe it in words.My biggest regret now is that I rated some other (great) movies a perfect 10 before this one. Because this one is so so so so much more. It really deserves a rating of it's own.My first and probably final review after hundreds of ratings without making one.Enjoy this masterpiece.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Weaker than other Japanese anime films,"In this animated film, Mitsuha is a teenage girl living in a rural mountainous area of Japan. Taki is a teenage boy living in Tokyo. At various times, the two switch bodies.The animation in this film is beautiful and there are clever moments in the film as well. When the story is comprehensible, it can be engaging. The trouble, as just implied, is that it is often difficult to understand. It's not always easy to know when each character is their real self or whether they are possessed by the other. To make matters even more difficult, the exchange is happening in different time lines three years apart.I might have used the excuse that I'm not that familiar with Japanese Anime films but that won't work as I've probably seen at least a half-dozen of them. My favourite is ""Only Yesterday"" (1991) which happened to have no supernatural elements. Among those with magical content, I have great admiration for ""Spirited Away"" (2001) and ""My Neighbor Totoro"" (1988).The two latter films had special universes that were bizarre but fascinating. Most importantly, they were always understandable and consistent - characteristics that are missing in ""Your Name"".",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Might be the greatest film I've ever seen,"(this is my review originally from myanimelist.com)Having never really seen any Anime before watching this movie (except from Pokemon and Dinosaur King when I younger), I didn't really have any expectations going into this. My family have a subscription to Amazon prime, and 'Your Name' was on there for free. Expecting at least a decent watch, what i saw instead was a Masterpiece in cinema, that I'll no doubt continue to love more and more as the years go on as I re-watch it.Story:The story starts out as a typical 'Slice of Life' kind of thing, except the main 2 characters from separate areas of Japan start swapping bodies with each other. Anyone who sees a DVD or Blu-ray of this movie knows this. But, something unexpected happens which tips the story on it's head and drives up the suspense and mystery. Don't read up anything about the plot. It leaves a lot of questioning and wonder which makes for an engrossing plot leaves you wanting more.Art:The art style is among the most beautiful I've ever seen. As an artist myself, I love seeing beautiful art, no matter what the medium is. The colors are vibrant, there is a lot of contrast in light and dark shades, the light sources are very realistic, which makes everything shine and glisten. The character designs are among the best I've ever seen, as they are simplistic, yet still contain plenty of detail so the viewer is never left wondering what a certain object is. The animation is very fluid, but can also become very rigid when it needs to.Characters:This is probably my favorite aspect of 'Your Name'. I fell in love and related with the characters so much and if anything tense or bad happened to them, I felt their pain and wanted nothing more than to see them pull through and come out the other end fine. Never in any kind of movie (live action, animated) have I ever felt this way about any of the characters, and that really says a lot of about the writing and voice acting. These aren't even physical people on the screen, and I'm getting worked up about them like I've known them for yearsSound:I've been listening to the music quite a lot recently, and it's really beautiful. Mesmerizing piano melodies, soulful string sections, with even some playful chords and melodies to match the more lighthearted and playful parts of the movie. It even has 2 original J-Pop songs that I've been really enjoying as of recently.Enjoyment:As you can probably already tell, I'm in love with this movie. I've never loved a movie's characters and plot as much as this. The plot takes many twists and turns, but never strays away from the true message of the film, and keeps you on your toes and keeps you hooked and in love with the whole packageOverall:This movie is a true masterpiece of cinema and rightfully deserves all the awards it's received. This is a movie that has nothing wrong with it. No flaws or things I wish they'd done differently or better. I'm looking forward to more re-watches of the movie.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"OK, but kitschy, difficult to understand, and badly paced.","We watched this movie with the entire family, full of expectation because the reviews are so glowing. We found it OK, but there were many things that we were not impressed with. To provide some balance to all the 10 ratings I'll focus on those:1. The script writing and editing. The story starts unbelievably slow, and at times we started talking as so little was happening. Then suddenly it goes into overdrive about two thirds in. Surely that could have been paced and edited better.2. The plot is confusing. We had to read up online after the movie to understand everything of what we had just watched.3. The music. We found the music pretty terrible: the songs were kitschy and overblown, with no memorable melodies at all.4. The visuals. Much is also made of them, and while they were indeed impressive, they often crossed over into kitsch.5. The crying. Characters break out in literally rivers of tears in a split second. Really? It's the main mechanism by which the movie is supposed to be touching, which again, is kitsch.Finally, not a fault of the movie, but be warned: in the version we watched, the English dubbing was rather different from the English subtitles. On the positive side, this provided us with some entertainment during the slow parts of the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
I think this is overrated.,"I have watched a lot of Anime films, and have heard recently that Your Name is very popular, an amazing film, heartfelt, top seller, etc.However, I feel Most Ghibli films and other anime films such as Wolf Children to be much better (sorry for the comparison). But, me watching so many of these kinds of films and reading a lot of manga similar to it; seemed very cliché.It didn't really felt like the plot had a message to convey, though I did really enjoy the plot. I personally love the swap body plot-line in manga. But I feel, it is not really original and some aspects over-used. I felt a strong resemblance to 5mm per second.What mainly spoilt the film for me was the singing. It was the same song and was used around 4 times over the course of the whole film. This got annoying and I went straight to turning the film off as soon as it went on credits. Which I don't do in other films I really enjoy. Though it is personal preference on the song used, I think it's a bit too much to use the same song 4 times in a film. Actually, I don't see any need to use it more than once!I also didn't feel any heart strings pull like other anime films for me.Although, I would say the art is outstanding and really pretty. (though I do wish when characters cry in anime, they make it more realistic with the face, too much perfection.)All this is just my opinion though. I would not say ""Don't watch it because it's crap"", I just think it's overrated.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Best Anime-Movie Ever!,"* SPOILER-FREE *Slowly but sure, the dynamics of the experience sharpened the sword- skills that be able to ruthlessly killing the starving hunters of perfect work. And Makoto Shinkai, at this point, has managed to slaughter millions of hunters who thrashed it.As one of the hunters who are hungry for perfect anime works, I died in peace after finished watching this latest masterpiece of Shinkai.Plots were served really wild rampage, breaking all models story line continues to guide the filmmaker. Characters are formed is extremely interesting. You never thought that this film has a very abstract antagonists. In addition, the value of Japanese culture and the uniqueness of Makoto Shinkai, a flavor that could not escape from view.In terms of story, you will never find a beautiful story line ""Your Name"" (Kimi no Na Wa). When you follow a minimum of one work of Makoto Shinkai before ""Kimi no Na Wa"" was created, as Byosoku (5 cm per second) or Kotonoha no Niwa (Garden of Words), then you will cry in silence because Makoto Shinkai managed to dribble the fans up to high point of suffering (if you know what I mean). It's like orgasm.In this film, you will be escorted into the recesses of nostalgia, even there are some scenes that explicitly have a template nostalgic with old work.Every second has a tremendous message payload in; served perfectly in its pictures, music, and soft-narration.Although the drama-animation genre became the main theme, science- fiction, even comedy to thriller was also embedded in this film. You can be out loud, tense, to tears.Shinkai-Sensei managed to ward off the stigma of anime that I would never be able to compete with classmates animated Pixar, Disney or Dreamworks. Even for me, this work surpasses them all!When this movie is over, my tears did not stop flowing. Life had stopped for a moment. My heart stopped right when the lights of auditorium was reached my face. Makoto Shinkai managed to tear my anxiety to rubble due to the work of the loveliest peace on earth.Well-played Makoto Shinkai. Hats-off.

Disappointing,"Disclaimer: I am not a fan of anime. I like Studio Ghibli, but only because their films can be enjoyed and even loved by people who don't typically like anime. Having said that, the animation in this movie is flat-out amazing. Every frame is a work of art, demonstrating unbelievable mastery of the film medium. Though a visual masterpiece, Your Name's flaws are, unfortunately, wide-ranging and deep. In fact, the movie's convoluted plot, poor choice of songs, unappealing characters, and off-putting, melodramatic tone make it a chore to sit through. I realize anime is not for everyone, but this movie really didn't connect with me. And it's not just because it's an anime film. It's because it's a movie whose plot and characters fail to engage the viewer in any meaningful way, whose soundtrack, tone, and overall style actively resist any attempt made by the viewer to enjoy the movie. If you decide to watch this movie, I hope you like it more than I did. Visually, there is a lot to appreciate. The movie is so good visually, I regret that I am not able to leave it a better review.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Actual Review.,"""Kimi No Na Wa"" is one of those few things that you remember for the remainder of your life. The Anime opens with a smooth introduction that ignites interest from the get-go. It actually takes 5 minutes to be inundated into the wonderful existence of the Designated Characters.The story is entirely basic as to begin with, however, as you advance you figure out how multi-layered this film truly is.The anime demonstrates the sheer acumen of the human personality.The anime engulfs the immaculate and theoretical speculations about time and space and associates them in a way that any individual would find breath-taking.The characters of the anime are exceptionally well-built which is extremely hard to reach in such a limited capacity of time.However the reason for its significant prevalence was the bittersweet moments inoculated into the anime,These moments show us that regardless of how hard we attempt, there are hurdles which accompany the progression of life and can only be removed by the flow of time. ""Peace of Mind"" is one of those things.It is not entirely a sentimental anime, however beyond any doubt pulls on one's heart strings.I trust the alacrity and energetic promptness which was incorporated into Mizunha's character was one the many reasons behind its brilliance. In a nutshell, if you're looking for a story which is both thrilling and vibrant then ""Kimi No Na Wa"" is for you. Until next time, Fellow Earthly Beings!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Without the proper character development the story falls flat and the emotional weight feels lacking. Its still an enjoyable movie with a basic, but serviceable plot.

"A pure visual, auditory, mentally-satisfying, spiritual, magical, spell-binding extravaganza","The ""anime"" form has a limited niche of audience may be due to the fact that computer-generated animation appears to be an eye-candy! Well these were my thoughts before I watched this movie (in Japanese). And boy, I was so wrong! I had watched Spirited Away in English a long time back due to its such rave reviews but somehow i felt that I missed something in that movie that others could see and I could not. And that was the end of my 'anime' career. Fast forward 4 years and here I was going through a rough patch of time as I beginning to think that good movies are not being made anymore and that I have watched everything there is to watch and that creativity has limits too! Well you can always be denounced wrong if you have directors like Mr Makoto Shinkai. Hats off to this great director and the music composers Mr Youjirou Noda and the Radwumps band!!! They have produced a masterpiece. A gem of a gem! What sweet romantic love story, a perfect romcoms! Also many praises to the editor of the movie that is again Mr Shinkai... The chemistry between the two lead characters is so strong and intense that you will be spell-bound. First half was a ""feel-good"" part that made me thought is this what the people all raving about? True even in first half, some of the scenes with the background song ZenZenZense were absolutely stunning like the scene with sunrise in the city and sunset in the rural area. Both are shot with absolute precision. Then the second half starts and you ate really caught off-guard. Now you will be really into the story that what is going on and what will happen further! I was on the verge of tears at 3 points in the movie and simultaneously I was pitching for the two protagonists. The comet scene with the song SPARKLE in the background provided a breath-stopping view of the beauty of the scenery. End of the movie was mentally satisfying when you are so much into the characters that any more tragedy might have made me crying my heart out.Now I admit that it took me 3 viewings to fully understand the story due to its complex plot but when you think you have seen every good story in the world then such a refreshing original story is really a big welcome.Now something about the background score and music! When you are watching a foreign language movie and there are no lyrics for the background music and even then you are perfectly in sync with the music, you get to know that the music composers, lyricist and singer have achieved a feat. Music is absolutely lovely. The end score ""Nande mo naiya"" was so ear-candy that I heard it like 15 times before closing this movie off! I immediately bought the Japanese original soundtrack and kept on listening (with English lyrics of course) to it for next 2 days. Only then I got to know that there is an English version of the movie and English version of songs. And now I am writing this review I am listening to the English version of the song ""Sparkle"". I am glad that I watched the movie in Japanese. May be if I would have watched the movie ""Spirited Away"" in its original language then I might have connected it to better.I am looking forward to watching more anime movies and I am really thankful to God that I got to see this movie in this lifetime. I have recommended this movie to more than 100 people till now and still counting. Please give yourself a treat, a peaceful heart-touching rest by watching this movie with your loved one. May be if you are going through a rough patch of time in your relationship then this movie might just be the thing that will rejuvenate your love! Again I can just go on boasting about this movie for eternity but before that watch it yourself and prove me correct.P.S. - The plot of this movie has a bit of resemblance with the Bollywood movie ""Haunted 3D"" which was India's first 3D in-home production, a horror zoner. Indian viewers who liked that movie would feel an instant connection with this movie. This movie is remembered more for its sweet love story and melodious music rather than for acting skills or overall storyline. Watch it at your leisure for the sweet horror love story and songs that you will keep on lipping for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"For a romantic body swap story, Your Name is possibly one of the most beautiful, best anime features ever made","What makes love hard to define is the connection that it develops between people. Think about the people that your with everyday. We think about friendship, love, lust, and companionship when your with those friends or lovers. The lines are drawn, but it can be blurred based on the invisible connection that you have with them. Even if you don't see them that day, you still feel their presence in your daily lives, as they feel the same in return. Not only is it metaphysical, but it's also feels like destiny when two lovers can feel that passion when their miles away. I've heard about these kinds of stories done in film and television, but I haven't seen it done in animation. I'm not talking about the countless Disney animated features that have the princess meet her man and their in love in three days; I mean a genuine romance that dives into to relationship and connection that two people have that's hard to explain. I'm thankful that a company like Funimation is willing to release such a film here in America with an English dubbing. So let's see how far a film like Your Name can push this idea.In the small lake/mountain town of Itomori, a teenage girl Mitsuha is board of country life and wishes that she were a boy living in Tokyo. The next morning, she wakes up in an unfamiliar room. She goes along with it, assuming it's a dream, and finds out that the body belongs to Taki, a Tokyo-based teenage boy who is quiet and works as a waiter. When she wakes up the next day, she's back in her body, but finds out that her body swap was not a dream as her friends tell her she was acting weird the other day. It turns out that Taki had her body vice versa.Trough a trust, Mitsuha and Taki make a set a rules on what to do when their body swaps happen. Taki ends up making Mitsuha more popular in school while Mitsuha improves Taki's relationships with his friends and boss at the restaurant. The two start to develop romantic feelings for each other, but after Taki fails to call her, the body swaps stop. Taki then uses his drawings of that mountain town to try and find it to hopefully find Mitsuha.It doesn't seem like much of a story, but I cannot give anymore of Your Name away as the majority of it is how much you don't know. It's a rare movie that not only has two twists, but is also a beautiful story of love. The script understands that true love happens over time, and the voice actors channel a lot of that emotion. Again, without spoiling it, the movie turns into an engaging mystery that made me want to see if the two would end up with each other. I cannot remember the last time I felt that way about a romantic movie.For a movie that didn't really need to be animated, Your Name looks amazing. When I think of good anime, I think of Studio Ghibli. This was produced by an independent studio that may just rival Ghibli. The animation is heavily detailed and uses it's style to it's advantage to tell the story of time-crossed lovers. I wouldn't be surprised if the production had started years ago, as I cannot imagine this being done quickly.I'm sorry that I can't give more information on what kind of story this is, but if you knew, you wouldn't enjoy it as much as I did. Even after it ended, I told myself that I would go see this again which I will.I'll give this ten comets out of ten. Though the summer season hasn't started, Your Name may already be my favorite movie of the year. It may be also one of the greatest anime features I've seen, up on the same levels as Spirited Away and Grave of the Fireflies. It's poetic, Shakespearian, philosophical, beautiful and engaging.

Laden with generic but scintillating humor (Mitsuha's habitual gazing and fondling of her boobs when her body is inhabited by Taki, but ostensibly not the other way around), zippy editing rhythm and hooky J-Pop anthems, the chucklesome paragraph reaches a halt when one day, Taki finds out that the swapping stops, and what follows are his dogged endeavor to looking for Mitsuha's village whose name eludes him with a bolt from the blue waiting down the line.Apparently and inexplicably, their temporalities are not uniform, but separated by three years, and Shinkai's savvy script circumspectly introduces the time-warp into the plot, which evolves into a touching and urgent past-changing undertaking for Mitsuha, facilitated by the numinous power of the traditional mouth-chewed sake and interlaced with a transcendent vis-à-vis in the twilight hour during which the two nearly have time to write down their names. The cataclysm cannot be averted but at least many lives are saved, yet, hampered by the fading memories of each other's names, will they be reunited in the same universe? You bet! Although the ending has a strained elation blatantly turning a blind on the odds of two individuals actually pass by each other randomly in a metropolis like Tokyo.Shinkai's virtuosity of devising picturesque scenery is an extraordinary feat to be reckoned with, a spate of celestial splendor and awe-inspiring landscape are scenery porn to hungry eyes, sometimes spiffed up by flashy juxtapositions of memories and hand-written sketches. Nevertheless, being someone who hasn't been versed in the realm of anime, one might wantonly hazard that the human character is a weak link in the process, their looks are invariably pedestrian and shy of memorable distinctions, perhaps it is an intrinsic defect in the animation where the niceties of facial expressions are still quite a challenge to visualize in technique terms. However, nothing can deny that YOUR NAME is a massive success and an infallible testimony of Shinkai's faculty to carry on the anime torch from royalties like Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

This film is simply a masterpiece in storytelling that has everything you want in a romance.,"Your Name is a Japanese animated film written and directed by Makoto Shinkai, based off his own novel of the same name. I was reluctant to watch this movie at first because besides the works of Studio Ghibli, I am not the biggest fan of anime. However, Your Name was making waves around the internet, with people considering it the best anime movie of all time. I am someone who is naturally gravitated towards hype, and with expectations leveled, and my mind opened, and I went ahead and saw the film. And boy, when the credits rolled, I was stunned, mesmerized and enchanted with just how beautiful this movie was in every way. My relationship with anime does not extend beyond Ghibli films, first few seasons of Pokémon and JRPG cutscenes, the reason being I always feel Japanese animation lacks gravitas and instead replaces it with heavy- handed over-the-top storytelling and voice acting. I was glad to see Your Name not succumbing to any of those tropes, in fact, Your Name being an animated film, was able to make laugh, cry, feel anxious and fulfilled all within 90 minutes, something most live-action movies with real actors cannot even dream of trying.Mitsuha and Taki, our two leads are very charming and funny. The main hook is you hardly see them as themselves, instead they are mostly in each other's bodies. Because of this, we see their characters develop as they literally walk in each other's shoes.The first act to my surprise was candidly funny. I found myself laughing out loud at the fish out of water and situational jokes. There is a running gag where every time Taki would wake up in Mitsuha's body, he would feel her boobs to make sure he is not in his own body, this is when Mitsuha's little sister would burst in the room and see her ""sister"" touching herself. Comedy like this is perfect, because it is within character, situational and not forced.I am going to avoid all spoilers for the second act onwards because I went in the movie knowing very little, and I wish for anyone watching this film to do the same.I will say there is an obstacle in the third act that is suspenseful and tension-filled but not in a Hitchcockian way. Instead, you just want to see the characters succeed and achieve the impossible so much, that when an obstacle stands between them, you cannot help but to be on the edge of your seat. I was rooting for them because I was emotionally invested in Taki and Mitsuha as human beings, and I care about them, and genuinely want a happy ending for them.Having some time to think about the movie after seeing it not too long ago, I felt Your Name connected with me on in intimate level few films have done before. Ever since I was young I was a romanticist, always believing the meeting with the love of my life is bound by some sort of fate and destiny since the beginning of time, and I simply have not found her. The movie explores this subject, what if you are tied to a person by a string? You two through thick and thin, chaos and peace, no matter the time difference, spatial difference, are destined to meet? A story of this kind would have touched my heart regardless of the quality of the actual film, but thankfully, besides having an excellently written script, the movie's supplemental elements like animation and music do not lag behind.The hand-drawn animation in this movie is probably the best I have ever seen. Every frame was perfectly crafted and colors are rich and vibrant. I especially appreciated the little details like water droplets on a spider web during the raining scene and of course, the deliciously animated food throughout. The movie was truly like a painting coming to life and rivals with even some of Ghibli's best. Another thing I need to mention is the music, composed by Japanese rock band, Radwimps. It was simply fantastic, amazing, incredible, heart- warming, heart-wrenching and every adjective that is associated with the word ""nostalgic."" Funny how a piece of music you have only heard for the first time recently can give you the feeling of nostalgia, but that is the power of this film's soundtrack. My favorite piece is Date that plays during Taki's date with his co-worker. The track accompanying the sunset imagery and Tokyo café evokes a poignant, bittersweet sentiment within me, and I absolutely loved it. It makes me think back of times in my life where I was in a similar situation as Taki, and the feelings I had then, the moment, the sunset, the yearning of days gone by.Your Name is a brilliant, heart-felt animated film about two different people's absolute desire to meet one another despite being separated by space and time. Taki and Mitsuha's conviction that leads them to the end of this emotional journey should be viewed by everyone, no matter if they like anime or not. This film is simply a masterpiece in storytelling that has everything you want in a romance. Go see this movie, you will not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful story,"I really didn't know anything about this film's plot or premise. All I knew about it was how popular it had become and the praise bestowed upon it by many people I know. It's an incredibly ambitious film, merging stories to tell a great tale of love and time. I admit, it was definitely not always easy to follow in what it was doing. However, in the hands of a lesser director this could have been really messy and jumbled. Instead, the themes of the film were always clear and its heart was always shining through. The screenplay effectively develops its main characters and you become incredibly emotionally invested in them, in a surprisingly large way that I myself didn't expect. It's a great film and it's only another example of how 2016 has proved to be a great year for animation.",,Anonymous,Animation

Smh,"See the thing I hate most about people who review movies is that all the good movies that have a plot and an actual story get the bad ratings and reviews, and then there's this movie. Let me start off by saying I'm currently watching this movie while writing this because I have already lost complete interest in this. Why did I lose interest in this?? Because the plot and screenplay is complete garbage, everything about the timeline of this movie is horrible put together and makes no sense unless you google it. What I don't understand is how
This movie has great ratings because honestly this movie is just plain bad. I've never written a review before and I was hoping this movie would resolve itself but it still hasn't and i doubt it will. I decided to give this movie a chance because I grew up watching and loving every single one of Hayao miyazakis movies and I thought why not I'll give this a shot. But here I am regretting this movie. The only thing I like about this movie is the animation which is beautiful.

"They're no strangers, yet they've never met.","Probably the most anticipated anime since the final film of Mr. Miyazaki. Because people know what these guys are capable of. This is one per cent sci-fi and 99 per cent fantasy. The concept is not new for us. From 'Freaky Friday' to 'The Lake House', even the recent American television film 'The Swap', you will remember a handful of names once you read this film's synopsis. Yet the film was so good, because of how well the theme was utilised.We all know the technical brilliance of '5 Centimeters Per Second' and the beautiful romance from 'The Garden of Words'. This is an excellent mix of those two. If love either of them, or both, then you will love it as well. But if you ask me, my favourite is still 'The Garden of Words' from this director. I liked this film, enjoyed thoroughly, so liking it less than that means not a bad flick. Surely a film to recommend for anime fans, as well as for animation's (western audience).The story of two teenagers, one from the rural Japan mountain region and the other one from Tokyo. The plot revolves around a comet that is to pass by very close to the earth. But before that event, the girl is bored with her life, so she dreams of living in a big city and that too as a boy. One day her wish comes true when she wakes up as she swapped bodies, including most of the memories with a boy from Tokyo.For her, it is to live as she wanted and make use of the opportunity. But for him, it is like a curse, hence becomes rebellious. This thing keeps happening frequently for days and weeks. After some times, realising the phenomena is between two, they make a deal and strict order of Dos and Don'ts while away. All this until the day of comet and everything changes forever. Searching for the truth and the result of it leads to the end of the tale.❝Treasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up.❞Unlike Miyazaki, Makot Shinkai's storytelling is quite for the matured audience. It targets adults more than the children. Particularly for not shying away to include naturally occurring events in such situation as the story develops, despite/even though the film revolves around the teens/kids. As for this flick, the concern is not big, but it depends on the nation and its culture you belong to. It is very much acceptable and as the story progress, the best things keep replacing another till the finale. So hooked to it is assured.The film length was good and so the pace of the narration. Well written screenplay, which was based on the book of the same name. But the director admits the inspiration from the previous flicks with similar themes. They have used the real places of the anime version with fictional names, but most of the Tokyo remains same and they all were awesome.In many scenes, the camera panning was a treat. Especially the framerate was high, so no jerks, hence very pleasurable visual experience. Like I mentioned earlier, this is a unique film, despite not a original idea. The film proved the Japan is not overshadowed by Hollywood, particularly after the decline of animes in the recent years. It's up to the quality of the product, if so, then those glory days can be brought back for animes. Anyway, now this film holds the record for highest grossed anime.Apart from technical dominance, the story is also enchanting. If you like romance theme, this will serve you well. A good film for date night. But usually people would skip animation for such occasion and one should not mix up that with anime. Because why I always put apart the anime and animation is, the animes are good at beautiful romance, while its counterpart from the west focus more on comedy and adventure. But the common thing from them is the well explored fantasy theme.Usually the ends are guessable for a film like this and the same case for this in here. Only as a result of the story, you would know what's coming, but not the frame by frame scenes of it. Yeah, I liked this conclusion, the final lines said might bring you tears in your eyes, romantically, if you are an emotional person. One of the best endings, even though it was clichéd. And the credits start to roll up, while you begin to recall everything you just saw in the last 100 minutes. A must see film, so highly recommended by my side. Now I've to wait for another couple of years for such film.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Just a little longer,"Makoto Shinkai's Your Name Follows the story of Mitsuha & Taki. Two Complete strangers who one day find themselves having switched places in each other bodies, and over time from a distance start to develop a bond through leaving each other notes and walking a mile in each other shoes. Only to be eventually torn apart by a disaster. This is a movie that came as a bit of a surprise. From many perspectives, it just looks like another romance, but its overall theme of distance is a theme that appears in many of the director's films. It does have a considerable amount of depth. Through its pacing and characters. It gives a relatable experience. Taken the tired played-out concept of body swapping and actually delivers something unique with its formula. The heart of this film does come from its leads and from the start it is actually from different perspectives. It's not Siblings or Friends, it's two random strangers one from Tokyo and the other far out in the countryside. So when they first swap you get the usual tropes of freaking out and even exploring some things for a second. However, at the same time, you believe the situation a lot more. It also really helps that the film doesn't just do the whole hijinks of a boy in a girl's body and vice versa for the duration of the film. They stay on it just enough and yet still keep that story going. Building up the relationship between Taki and Mitsuha. This starts to become even better when a certain thing is revealed about the two and it just adds to the emotions that the film was striving towards. It goes without saying the Animation's beautiful along with the music. The lighting and the shadow work really sets the mood.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Best Film, Animated and Not, I have seen in years.","Disclaimer: This review is spoiler free and for the lazy reader, I will give ratings based on main categories:Story:9Art:10Sound:10Character:9Enjoyment:10Overall:10.Now that we have gotten that out of the way, I want to give my personal opinion on the film, with a rather unconventional review:What is beauty? Is it the sound of the sea during a storm? Is it the sound of grasshoppers on a humid summer's day? Is it determined by any one single dominant element, or the fusion of several threads that come together, interconnecting, to form a myriad of colors in a tapestry?What is a masterpiece? Is it a magnum opus? Is it something that fills us with pathos, until we are at the brink of tears, be they of joy or of sadness?But more importantly, I ask you, reading this, how do you decide what constitutes a masterpiece and what doesn't?Makoto Shinkai's latest work, Kimi No Na Wa, is all that and more. Setting the bar very high for following works, it sits comfortably among the greats in animation, if not filmmaking in general. He (Shinkai) has earned his place among the great directors of our time, and western animation could learn a lot about storytelling by example. I recently went to see this expecting to see your average slice of life/romance anime, and had my doubts, figuring it would have had all the usual clichès, boy meets girl, falls in love, etc etc at least, that is what the trailers would lead you to believe. But this film is anything but average, moreso I wouldn't even call it a film, but an almost two hour experience. A delight for all the senses it satisfies from the beginning to the end and it has a completeness to it that few other films may boast, not only among anime but among films in general.That being said, this film is not perfect. In fact it very well may have several imperfections, mainly characters and storytelling (though it was a completely new topos for me); imperfections which more likely than not have been discussed at length by other people. All I can suggest to the reader, is to see it and decide for themselves. Anything else would do you, the reader, and the film quite an injustice.Art, being human, is, by definition, imperfect in itself. But does that make the emotions that it evokes in us any more or less valid? A painting may have corrections, and a book may have errors. Are those works of art any more or less masterpieces just because they aren't perfect?The truth is, nothing is perfect, nor will it ever be, not while created by imperfect beings. But why does that matter? Why strive for objective perfection, when we perceive imperfect things to be perfect?It isn't a perfect film, but it is, possibly more importantly, a perfect experience.What really else matters?",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An enjoyable watch if you like animations,"I'm not too familiar with Japanese anime movies, but this movie was very enjoyable. It honestly grew on me, after having had some time to think about the movie. The movie has a well thought-out plot, with good characters that are easy to empathise with. Some of the scenes were beautifully animated, adding 3D elements, with big differences and foreground and background focus, making it often feel as though you are watching a normal film, instead of an animation. I did however feel that the female character's voice was a bit whiny at times, and it made me think I was watching a baby toddler having a tantrum instead of a teenager, but this may be more to Japanese taste than mine. Overall an enjoyable watch, would recommend it if you are into animations.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The drawings are amazing, I had shivers just from looking at the sceneries. The music also is really good, the artists did a really amazing job with that whole aspect, props to them.

A Compelling and Captivating Journey,"I went to see 'Your Name' (Kimi no na wa) at an art house theater and when I did, I was left compelled and in awe of how such a story really grew on me. The thematic material felt remarkably similar to Hayao Miyazaki's way of storytelling that it makes director Makoto Shinkai look like he now follows in the same ranks as the renowned filmmaker (even if Shinkai himself humbly says it's an ""overestimation"" when being compared to Miyazaki).The plot revolves around a teen named Taki and a girl named Mitsuha, who have never met and live in opposite sides of Japan. For some unknown circumstance, they randomly switch bodies back and forth while they sleep and live each other's daily lives. During that time, they learn more about their likes, dislikes, activities, the people they know, and places they go to up until they reach a point of understanding one another on an emotional level that they must meet in person.Shinkai definitely unveiled such a setup with vibrant settings of both Japan's countryside and its traditional customs. Likewise for the overwhelming, yet lively urban city of Tokyo and especially the assortment of likable characters that it had a great balance of both good humor and touching moments. Although the motif of switching bodies has been done numerous times in past films or shows for years, this however provided a deeper sense of atmospheric warmth and compassion occurring between both Taki and Mitsuha. Not to mention the use of the proverbial Red String of Fate used as a metaphor to emphasize their connection. I acknowledge that Shinkai admitted in one interview that he wanted to keep expanding on the movie's mythos and pathos, but couldn't for studio-related reasons. As for me, I felt that perhaps there could've been more done as well (namely on the film's epilogue), but nevertheless it's a movie that flowed seamlessly well with an interesting blend of music done by J-rock band Radwimps that I wasn't left bored in the least.Moral: Trust your heart by running down the uncertain path and see that you'll feel this sense of yearning you never knew you had.I certainly did.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not a huge fan of anime, or animated movies in general,  but I did like this film.","'YOUR NAME': Four Stars (Out of Five)The blockbuster Japanese animated fantasy drama, about a high school girl, in rural Japan, and a high school boy, in Tokyo, that switch bodies. The film was written and directed by acclaimed Japanese filmmaker Makoto Shinkai. It's gotten almost unanimous rave reviews from critics and fans alike, and it's also broken Box Office records all around the world (including becoming the 4th highest grossing film in Japan's history). I enjoyed the film as well.Mitsuha (Stephanie Sheh) is a high school student that lives in Itomori, a rural town in the mountains of Japan. She is very unhappy with small town life, and dreams of moving to Tokyo. Taki (Michael Sinterniklaas) is a high school student living in Tokyo, that also works at a local Italian restaurant (part-time). He aspires to become an architect. One day the two magically switch places, thinking it's just a dream, and their lives are never the same again.I'm not a huge fan of anime, or animated movies in general, but I did like this film. I can definitely see why it's such a huge hit at the Box Office too, and with critics, and not just in Japan. Of course they're already planning an American remake as well (with J.J. Abrams producing). The switching bodies story gimmick has been done many times before, but the body swapping of a male and female high school student seems somewhat fresh and original. Where the filmmakers take the story is also interesting and involving. There's of course some silly coming-of-age humor in it too, and it's far from a perfect movie, but it's definitely a well made and entertaining one (in my opinion).Watch a new episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xsOj7IhB5us",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful images and...,"Is the cinema a vehicle for beautiful images independent of the narrative purpose of the film? Your Name is one of the most stunningly animated features I have ever seen, but the level of emotional resonance is somewhat far south of my favorite Studio Ghibli Films which this film purports to surpass (or equal.) What is the ultimate point of this movie? The body swapping story is obviously old-hat, but I felt it would lead to something grand, eventually. But (spoilers- don't read reviews when you don't want spoilers!) when the comet angle surfaced, I thought that things might finally get interesting. But instead, the film built up to a climax with basically a Get out of Jail Free Card idea. (I note that Taki summarily rejects a sexpot who is a great person from all evidence, and makes him look like an asshole in the process.) I recall that Isao Takahata's Only Yesterday was supposed to be a merely ""good"" animation from Studio Ghibli. Disney wouldn't even release it due to a frank discussion about female periods. But that film made me cry, and several times on a repeat viewing. Now, in that film's quiet, realistic, and understated style, why did I find such deep resonance, but a love story where a comet (spoilers!!!) wipes out an entire town cannot? I have to spread the blame around to all in Creative.That being said, this is a very good animated film from Japan, but I have to say it doesn't quite live up to its hype. It's a bit too emo and heavy handed. There are many parts where the lead characters scream out each other's name. There's no subtlety at all. Me thinks that the amazing images fool people when married to a heavy handed approach to presenting emotional content. Another refresher if you want an awesome coming of age story from Japanese masters, check out Whisper of the Heart. There's nothing in Your Name that matches the awe of Shizuku discovering the antique shop for the first time, and meeting the Baron...

The music score and direction in this film are key selling points, both beautiful and haunting. With key pieces placed in all the right places. I was glued to the edge of my seat the entire movie. I was never in a rush to get to the next scene, I just took it in, in all its glory and in the end it left me completely satisfied.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Indian guy fell in love with this movie...the most awesome romantic movie there is,"One of the major drawback of being an otaku in India is that anime is still part of a small subculture and so getting to watch anime by legit sources is difficult. You can't buy DVDs because they are not available, Funimation and Crunchyroll aren't active in India and few people get animax on their TVs and these few of those few people realise its worth. So, I started watching anime with pokemon in 2002 when i was four, followed it with Cyborg 009 and Dragon ball z. At a point, I had to stream Dragon ball z in 2009 at really slow speeds. I got 20mbps now but getting to watch anime is still a difficult task. Getting to watch Your Name(Kimi no Na wa) too was difficult but trust me it was worth it.So, this story is about a countryside girl, Mitsuha and a city boy, Taki(that's an awkward sentence) who switch their bodies while they think they are dreaming but the truth is something else...I didn't even read the plot before watching the movie due to the amazing critical reception and highly positive word-of-mouth. I mean that's what Indians do. But it is more than safe to say that this movie has surpassed my expectations. Silver Linings Playbook is not my favorite romantic movie anymore. This movie has outpaced major Indian romantic movies by miles.What makes it so special is the original and highly compelling story line. There is good character development, especially the main characters, Mitsuha and Taki. I can't decide who I like more, Mitsuha or Taki. There is no mistake in the movie that can be seen by the naked eye and even if there was one, this movie's emotional aspect is so strong that it would have overshadowed the mistakes. I can't comment about voice acting here because i don't really understand Japanese. Subtitles are still my best friends. The visuals are striking and beautiful, especially Itomori ones. The degree of the fantasy angle is just right. It leaves people wanting more. Expect many gasps and sighs. The characters do get familiar with each other's lives but there always remains a sense of awkwardness and alien nature of each other's lives. The chemistry between the main characters is very good and it's the way they handle each other's lives that makes audience praise it and write reviews. Tear jerkers please keep tissues at your side. You will need them. Watch this one with your partner even if he/she is not into anime.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Well executed tropes, ingenuity and visual porn","Who would have know... This gem took a while to cross the oceans into western audiences cinemas, and it was worth every minute! It is a signature Makoto Shinkai piece, the visuals are just beautiful, the dedication to representing modern Tokyo and the Japan country-side is mesmerizing, a work of art which carries intensity and uses all at its disposal to provide a truly cinematic experience, including a great soundtrack! Story wise I can't praise enough the well executed tropes from the genre, and the appropriately quick pacing which respects the audience capacity to follow the flow. Plot wise there's no overly complicated setups (altough some would argue the plot is complicated...), the hooks are fantastically delivered and more than delights the viewer with their conclusions. The main character relationships are always on the forefront, and the secondary characters are well fleshed out, the audience grows to love them.Can't recommend enough Kimi no Na wa doesn't revolutionize, but neither does it have to, it is plain simply excellent. 9.8/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Poorly edited - visually disappointing,"I am a great anime fan and bought the BluRay edition of this film on the strength of the strong reviews on this and other sites. Having been spoilt by the visual quality of the studio Ghibli films, I assumed 'Your Name' would be of the same standard.Was I disappointed! I found Your Name to be unwatchable 10 minutes in. I persevered and watched it right to the end. I ended up feeling irritated with the visual imprecision, annoyed with myself that I bought it, wondered if this was a defective copy. I don't like scene after scene with blurry, unfocussed edges and centre focus only, I don't like washed out colours, faded clarity of line, image looking like it's been filmed though gauze, use of what appear to be incomplete drafts rather than completed images. Part of the enjoyment of watching individual cell animation is the precision and colours that you simply don't get with 'real film'. Don't expect that here.Most of the reviews here are of the storyline, and comment on the visuals, if at all, in general terms. Film is a visual medium. No amount of brilliant story line can compensate for inferior visuals. And in this day and age there is no longer any excuse for poor visuals.I'm most disappointed in this film, I really expected a highly competent visual performance to justify an interesting story. I give it 4 stars of the basis of the few brief undistorted visuals which made it past the editing process. If you're not Into visuals, close your eyes and let it run as the story has interesting moments. If you are into visuals, probably give it a miss.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""Your Name"" is a sweet, engaging and beautiful, but confusing and somewhat loopy movie.","Sit back, relax and let me tell you what I think of Your Name. No, not your name (that would be way too personal) I'm talking about the Japanese anime fantasy feature film ""Your Name"" (PG, 1:46). Now, if you're not familiar with Your Name, you should be. In the first place, who doesn't know their own name? (Okay, enough bad puns.) The MOVIE ""Your Name"" opened in U.S. theaters on April 7, 2017, a little over seven months after its release in Japan. Before it even reached the U.S., the film had become the fourth biggest film ever at the Japanese box office, their top-grossing film of 2016 AND the #1 anime worldwide to date! Based on the 2016 novel of the same name by Makota Shinkai (who also wrote and directed the screen adaptation), there is much to distinguish this film from previous anime features.The film's roots are a combination of the traditional and the contemporary, as it forged a fresh path both in Japan and beyond. This is the first anime not directed by Hayao Miyazaki to make over $100 million (about 10 billion Yen) in Japan. ""Your Name"" also became the highest-grossing Japanese release in China and was the first Japanese film in a dozen years to attain the top box office spot in South Korea. Not bad, for a film that is singularly Japanese. One of the reasons given for the film's success is the soundtrack, which includes songs from Yojiro Noda, lead singer for the Japanese rock band Radwimps. Critics and audiences have also praised the film's animation, as well as the plot and its emotional impact. According to Wikipedia, ""Inspiration for the story came from works including Shūzō Oshimi's 'Inside Mari', 'Ranma ½', the Heian period novel 'Torikaebaya Monogatari', and Greg Egan's short story 'The Safe-Deposit Box'."" The film's main location, a town called Itomori, is fictional, but the buildings and landscape are based on Japan's Gifu Prefecture. Itomori is where the central character in this story lives.Mitsuha Miyamizu (voiced by Mone Kamishiraishi in the Japanese version and by Stephanie Sheh in the dubbed English-language version) is a high school student who wants more out of life than what her tiny hometown has to offer. She's not very self-confident, she doesn't have many friends, she cares little for tradition and is even less enthusiastic about being the daughter of the town's mayor. While her tough, traditionalist widowed father is busy mayoring, Mitsuha and her young sister are being raised by her traditional, but kind grandmother. All of Mitsuha's frustrations boil over one day when she shouts into the sky that, instead of a meek country girl, she wishes she were a handsome boy living in Tokyo.Then it happened – Mitsuha wakes up one morning to discover she has mysteriously switched bodies with just such a young man named Taki Tachibana (Ryunosuke Kamiki / Michael Sinterniklaas). Both high schoolers are understandably disoriented and upset by finding themselves in the body of someone of the other gender, in a house with a family and going to a strange school in a different place and with friends whom they don't know. Mitsuha and Taki each believe they're dreaming, so they just get by as well as they can and wait to wake up. When they do each wake up the next morning, back in their own beds, they're relieved until their family and friends comment on how strange they've been acting.These body swaps continue happening, about every other day, but the memories of what Mitsuha and Taki each do in the other's body quickly fade, much like a dream. To keep track of what's going on, the two teens start leaving each other notes, first in paper notebooks, and then on their smartphones – and they start intervening in each other's lives. Mitsuha, as Taki, helps Taki start a romantic relationship with his supervisor at the restaurant where he works part-time, and Taki, as Mitsuha, helps her become more popular. When their body swaps suddenly and inexplicably stop, Taki tries to make contact with Mitsuha in real time, but cannot reach her by cell phone. He takes a train to her district, armed with sketchy and fading memories from his days as Mitsuha, and learns something which affects him profoundly and causes both he and Mitsuha to embark on separate, but parallel and highly significant tasks.""Your Name"" is a sweet, engaging and beautiful, but confusing and somewhat loopy movie. The animation features especially vibrant colors and it is creative and skilled, often giving the impression of depth, even as a 2-D production. The movie also provides an interesting window into the world of modern Japan, through the juxtaposition of urban and rural environments. The main characters and supporting players are likable and fun to watch, but sometimes act illogically. More problematic, however, are dealing with the movie's plot holes and keeping track of who is who, when, and what is happening during some of the body swaps. But all of that aside, ""Your Name"" features an interesting story, which includes elements of humor, excitement and even suspense and charms its audience. It combines influences from many sources, but still feels fresh, creative and vital. This film is ""Freaky Friday"" meets ""The Lake House"", with the look of an updated ""Spirited Away"", and it's visually and emotionally pleasing in spite of its shortcomings.

My favourite movie of all time,"Animated movies don't get much better than this.STORY & MAIN CHARACTERSIn ""Your name"" we follow Mitsuha and Taki on a romantic adventure straight out of your own imagination.When young Mitsuha and Taki start exchanging bodies, everything in their lifes would change. The viewer follows them on a exciting adventure of love, school life and growing into an adult.Taki is a young boy from Tokyo living his life while going to school and working a part-time job. He's a compelling main character, someone who's easy to follow as the degenerate that I am.Mitsuha on the other hand is a country girl. She lives out in the country, going to school and performing ceremonies with her family since they take care of the town shrine. She's an energetic girl, with dreams about moving to Tokyo and leaving her town. The viewer has an easy time relating to a girl in the same situation as her.ART & MUSICMy favourite part about this movie is not the characters or the story. It's the art and music. The art is excellent with wonderful colours and vibrant animations. There's not a single moment in this movie that isn't wallpaper friendly. Just screen cap any moment that you like and you got yourself a new wallpaper.The music is also incredible. It's all produced by the band ""Radwimps"" and you can find the tracks on Youtube but also Spotify. It's some of the best music I've ever heard in an anime.RATING & RECOMMENDATIONFor me this movie is a clear 10/10. I watched it at home at first but then later went to my local cinema in Sweden since they actually had a screening there. In total, since it's release in Sweden. I believe I've watched it 5-10 times.

"Cheesy, but beautiful nonetheless.","I'm not an anime fan. I do like all the Studio Glibly/Hayao Miyazaki I've seen: Spirited Away, From up on Poppy Hill, Princess Mononoke, all fantastic films; but outside of that I don't like the anime style. So, when I started watching this, I was expecting a Miyazaki sort of film. Within 10 minutes I was tempted to turn the movie off, it definitely felt very cheesy and very anime-esk. But, I had paid $4 to rent it on Amazon Prime so I stuck with it.Boy am I glad I did. As the film progressed, I quickly realized the plot was not going to be what I expected. The subversion they pull on you is incredible. A plot with twists and turns that keep you on your toes the whole film, but with a beautiful ending that ties everything together. I can't get the movie out of my head. It was convincing, it was character driven, and it was satisfying. Suprisingly enough, it avoided the easy ""deus ex machina"" endings it could have employed, and kept the ""magic"" (for lack of a better word) consistent enough so as to not ruin ones suspense of disbelief. It's never forced, the story flows where it feels it should, and even though it ends exactly where you want it to, it takes a very unexpected route to get there. The plot is truly magnificent.So, why only 9 stars then? Why not ten? Because despite of the magnificent plot, it was still a little on the nose. This may have been for two things: 1) I watched it english dubbed, so it may be less cheesy in it's original language (I wanted to watch it subbed but Amazon only had dubbed), or 2) It's target audience was probably a younger audience, and normally such audiences aren't very good on picking up on subtleties. Regardless, iffy dialogue is iffy dialogue. There were moments that had good dialouge, for example, without spoiling anything, a certain scene near the end on top a mountain was very well done, very authentic. But many other parts felt a little like the characters saying what they felt, instead of showing it. Show, don't tell.Still, in spite of the sometimes on-the-nose dialogue, it's an absolutely beautiful film. Would highly recommend, even if you're not a huge anime fan. You get past the anime cheesiness.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Gorgeous!,"It may be a fantasy, it may be animated, but this is both beautiful and brilliantly entertaining. Mitsuha lives in a small idyllic Japanese town, but dreams of something bigger. Being a teenager, being the mayors daughter, she wants out. Taki lives in Tokyo, goes to school, works in a restaurant. When they go to sleep and dream, they switch places. They don't know why, but as they begin to understand what's happening they leave messages for one another to try to navigate each other through lives. Mitsuha seems to enjoy the excitement of Taki's life in the big city. Taki though finds her a meddling influence in what should be his life. There's a suggested spirituality to all this, with Mitsuha's grandmother explaining the concepts of connections, strings through time, through worlds. Despite this, it does occasionally have the tone of an American teen comedy, but it's far too gorgeous to be so one dimensional. On numerous occasions my breath away is taken away by the level of detail, not just in the animation, but the cutting and the plot. It's lovingly crafted with a staggering amount of patience. It doesn't really create a fantasy world in the way that so many Studio Ghibli films do, it's seems more interested in inserting a fantasy element into an otherwise normal everyday world. Then, just as it begins to feel normal, the switches stop and Taki sets out to find Mitsuha. The comet shower that appears to have been linked to the connection, turns out to have destroyed Mitsuha's village 3 years before she ever met Taki. Are they dreaming through time, is she a ghost? It does get a bit complicated, especially when reading subs and it's very sentimental, but I really enjoyed it. Mitsuha and Taki are connected through space and time, a bond that cannot be broken and delivers a fantastic finale that had me gripped!

Eye-catcher,"Japanese hand-drawn anime featuring a slightly unusual take on the freaky-friday-esque body swapping trope.In a continuous string of well-drawn dualities on one hand you have Mitsuha, a girl from a small town engrossed in a traditional Shinto upbringing; on the other you have Taki a boy from ultra-modern Tokyo working part-time as a waiter.The small town is realised with a soft, dreamy sunshine-streaked palette; Tokyo as near photo-realist and futuristic - in both cases, the visuals are handled with real care & attention and quite noticeable: it's a visual treat.The plot follows 3 main stages, of the 2 main characters realising their predicament, developing each others lives in some way and eventually Taki's efforts to find Mitsuha in the 'real' world. (they can't remember each other's names, hence the title)Some unexpected turns are found and it really ramps up the tension for a thriller of a denouement.
The voice work here (dubbed into English) is standard fare, and the sound track super poppy which for whatever reason I found faintly amusing.Very engaging overall and a nice compact running time, recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Masterclass in Art and Storytelling,"One of the great works of eastern media, Your Name tells a story worthy of early childhood disney level nostalgia. The animation alone could carry a mediocre plot and poor characters with its bright colors, recognizable scenery and almost artwork.

Life-Changing Experience,"H-H... Ho... How does something like this even exist???? EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF THIS MOVIE FEELS SURREAL. The stunning visuals, the astounding soundtrack, the brilliant characterization, the spectacular direction, the incredible pacing, everything feels just SO DAMN PERFECT. Seconds after you hit the play button, you already know it'll be one of the greatest films ever. Your Name captivates you like no other movie does. It's a very nuanced and meticulously crafted narrative, phenomenal instances of ""showing not telling,"" and to see the knot of this story slowly untwine (see what I did there?) is indescribably satisfying. Honestly, it doesn't take much to make me cry, but this movie messed me up way beyond anything has in a very long time. I will NEVER forget the emotions I felt watching this. The way Your Name uses anticipation is nothing short of ingenious. You'll get so enthralled by the events of the story that, at a certain point, Taki and Mitsuha just stop being characters altogether and become real people, because you're just that immersed in the film, and therefore YOU MUST SEE THE RESOLUTION TO THEIR STORYLINE. You begin to feel what they're feeling, to live what they're living, and you're just as eager as them to see their reunion, transcending the boundaries of a movie and turning into this unique, mesmerizing experience that you can't get enough of.It frankly blows my mind how little of a budget this movie had relative to other anime films, because judging solely by the production value, you'd think this cost the entire country of Japan. I seriously can't get over how good this movie looks. Every scene feels like it could pay your entire life's worth of expenses. Interestingly, the quality of the visuals adds even more to the immersive aspect of the film. Those dreamlike animation sequences are the rule, not the exception here, so you don't get those sudden chills you normally would when they'd bump up the animation quality for an important scene in a traditional movie or something, THE CHILLS ARE THE FREAKING STATUS QUO IN YOUR NAME. THAT'S HOW INSANE IT IS. And you know what's even more absurd? Is that everything else is on par with the visuals. This movie.... THIS MOVIE, OH GOD.I don't know how to describe it. Your Name is a magical film, it's unlike anything I've ever seen. If there's one feeling from media I think is very underrated is this sense of otherworldly wonder, when you have a hard time believing your eyes because what you're witnessing is just that perfect. I can't name that feeling, but this movie encapsulates it so effortlessly. So many scenes will live rent-free in your head afterwards, and so will the memories you'll have of the first time you saw the story of Taki and Mitsuha, one of the greatest romances ever told in history. In all seriousness, if you haven't seen this movie already, I am so, so, SO JEALOUS of you.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
change my mind,"What can anime bring us?
Maybe just like the movie, anime can also dream for us, maybe we will never reach the world of the second element, but only this hopeless and unavailable feeling is the most moving!
As a form of anime, ""Your Name"" does bring me the feeling that other films are difficult to convey. Man is a contradictory complex, which is what can be brought to us through those unique works.
Even though love and thoughts may be so rare in real life, we will still keep searching because I believe it will exist. Looking for that particular person in a huge city, and the name that I have forgotten but lingered in my heart, two tiny individuals connected by knots beyond time and space, this thought will still exist forever.Perhaps we will be entangled in the fact that Sanye and Taki in the film dare not recognize each other, but imagine who in reality you and I dare to travel thousands of miles to find that TA with consciousness?
Xin Haicheng brought a moving story this time and accompanied by the beautiful picture as always, ""Your Name"" may not be perfect, and there are even various plot bugs, but just like ""City of Philharmonic"" for movies and dance films In the same way, it still made me a fan who rarely watched anime began to like Japanese anime and moved me for a long time.
Xinhaicheng used its own way to wear the local culture of Japan to the whole world through anime. Perhaps this also provided a template for creators to spread the national culture to the whole world!

The only one who can change your destiny is you.,"Makoto Shinkai in the most humble way possible takes a story of his own and improves it until he turns it into a spiritual odyssey about body switching and puts on the table if you would dare to change something about yourself or others no matter the risk if it makes the one you love happy, he asks you directly if you would leave everything behind for love, filling it with color and moving sounds that make this film become a synergistic piece that complements itself, everything connects and this world is so beautiful that you would like to be part of it, presenting characters that are too human, with simple problems and with everything in place so that they can be happy as they are, but who in the face of adversity and change have to show how capable they are of moving forward, having to decide if they are willing to sacrifice their lifestyle in order to guarantee the good of the other, even if this means having to forget about the bond that destiny put in front of them, Shinkai has managed to create a world with its own mythology, magic, nature, which almost seem like another character in the story, he manages to give the necessary tools to the two main characters to carry out his crusade and a music that acts as a messenger from Shinkai himself to tell us that something is wrong with the story, as if what we are seeing should not happen like this, he is telling us that the protagonists must be together, but only they are capable of changing their destiny, even if everything is against them, in the end this story is about them, and when the outcome finally arrives the same music is what tells us that everything will be okay, this film is a warm hug for the soul.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I found myself bound to them in a manner that few love stories can hold me and was riveted throughout the film.

Underwhelming,I found Your Name to be highly underwhelming. While the animation and overall presentation are fantastic. I couldn't get into the story and characters at all. I found the characters were either extremely cliched or bland. I couldn't care less about their journey. So when scenes that were meant to be emotionally impactful happened I was left rather unaffected. It doesn't help that a lot of the music choices were really out of place and cheesy.The films plot gets very messy and convoluted in its second act and only goes downhill from there. It doesn't help that the plot is derivative of films such as Donnie Darko and Freaky Friday. While I wouldn't say I hated this film. I was very disappointed by it. Nothing about Your Name apart from the gorgeous animation impressed me at all. I was thoroughly bored by this film. I know Your Name is highly acclaimed.

Truly Spectacular,"Your Name is a coming of age, slice-of-life romantic fantasy film that tells a heartfelt story of love and loss. Now during the first few minutes I kinda did wonder if this was another typical gender swapping animes but this is so much more than that. The plot might
not be anything new but the overall writing, pacing and character moments are so beautifully done that it becomes hard to lose interest. It also features one of the most unique love stories ever presented on screen. The movie goes through a vast array of tonal shifts from comedy to drama to melancholy which handles pretty well.Then there's the animation.

"Chekhov's gun is not only smoking, but lying on the ground broken from overuse","The next Hayao Miyazaki, they said. Does it live up to the expectations?Well, surprisingly, yeah.Your Name is a visually stunning film by a hipster by the name of Shinkai Makoto. This is a film that revels in being completely predictable: every moment in the film is set up by noticeably obvious foreshadowing, yet each moment is made meaningful by careful structuring. Where small mistakes would have ended in a sappy drama that is disconnected from the central plot elements, Your Name proves that execution is everything.Not everything is perfect, however. The immediately noticeable issues are the AMVs seemingly thrown in the runtime at random. There is a total of four pieces of vocal soundtrack for the film, all of which play out like a music video and not a legitimate film. It's a janky disconnect to a otherwise well structured film.Though a few issues may exist, it's impossible to look past the masterful craftmanship of the film in general. With a few twists on top of following storytelling convention by the book, it may not quite be at the level of Ghibli's best films, but it's pretty damn good.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

This anime has one of the most vibrant color palettes I have ever seen on screen and its animation clearly was worked on with a lot of hard work. To top it, the plot is really sappy and kind of melodramatic, but I don't think this necessarily hurts the film. People who love slice-of-life/romantic animes will get a kick out of this film, but I can't promise others that they will appreciate it as much since the third act does drag on and the use of music is a bit excessive creating a feeling of disingenuous drama.For me, I did tear up a bit. The hand-painted cells are just amazing and I can be a sucker for sappy romance. And the plot does give something to the audience member to engage on.

From a storytelling perspective, it may seem childish and detached from reality, but I believe the story is very authentic. Every time I try to analyze Japanese films and TV dramas rationally, trying to find the truth, the answers I get are always contrary to my wishes. I always find that the stories are unrealistic, unrealistic, and overly fictional and designed.After reading 'Your Name', I seem to have found the answer that Japanese stories are surreal.

Breathtaking,"When I decided to watch ""Your Name,"" my expectations were modest, shaped by a certain ignorance about the film's content. I was prepared for ordinary entertainment; what I experienced, however, was nothing short of a cinematic revelation. ""Your Name"" turned out to be a masterpiece that is simply perfect in its entirety.From the opening scenes, I was captivated, captured by the music of RADWIMPS, whose sounds are not only moving but also imbue each scene with an emotional depth rarely achieved so precisely in film. The music accompanies the perfectly staged moments, enveloping the viewer completely in the story.Visually, the film is in a league with the great works of Studio Ghibli. The love for detail in the drawings, from the vividly designed characters to the breathtakingly elaborate backgrounds, shows a craftsmanship that makes hearts beat faster. Each scene is a work of art in itself, filled with colors that reflect the emotional worlds of the protagonists.The plot itself is a profound narrative that elegantly rounds off the package. The story of random encounters and fateful connections, of lost time and rediscovered connections, is poetic and gripping. It seamlessly integrates into the visual and musical garment that makes ""Your Name"" so unique.It's rare for a film to offer everything: a captivating story, visual brilliance, and a musical accompaniment that completes the experience. Yet ""Your Name"" achieves just that. The film lacks nothing; it is a harmonious symphony of image, sound, and narrative.In conclusion, ""Your Name"" is not just an outstanding anime experience but a cinematic masterpiece that convinces in every respect. It is a film that touches, excites, and remains in memory. A work that must not only be seen but felt. A clear masterpiece that I can recommend to anyone ready to embark on an extraordinary journey. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Notebook but for weebs,"And I've never seen the Notebook.This movie was ok. I feel like that this movie was too full of montages to get me invested in the characters.I like the gender swap plot. That was really funny and good?Kimi no na wa is about Mitsuha and a Taki who swap bodies but create an unbreakable bond with each other.Taki lives in the big city and Mitsuha lives in a traditional town.They live each other's life. This body swap cause each other to see the girl's death. This causes Taki to go on an epic adventure to prevent her death in a time warp. This plot twist makes the movie unfocused.However, this movie is so beautiful that it fools you into believing it's meaningful. Holy moly! This is one of the best looking anime movies in years. Everything has complimentary colors! Split complimentary! Blue and orange! Purple and yellow! The characters animate so fluidly and realistically, the backgrounds are realistic. Everything is glowy. The character designs are reminiscent of Digimon which I don't like but it gives the movie a youthful vibe. One word Meteor shower.The music is beautiful new age.Maybe my ears where ruined by the Rugrats sounding dub.

A totally disappointing Makoto's movie,"A really disappointing animation by Shinkai Makoto. I used to love his work like ""5 Centimeters Per Second"" but this time he created a mass of kitsch. Yes the animation is beautiful but it can't tell the story. ""Your Name."" is just a bad taste anime to entertain the audience, and show how Makoto lost his own vision and style to made a popular popcorn movie (like Michael Bay did). The thing I can't stand the most is how the people keep hyping this movie (even Makoto told people do not go to the theater watch this movie).The main characters are empty. They didn't have a real interaction, I cannot understand why the people think this is emotional. Okay maybe the emotion doesn't really need to be rational but I hardly feel the characters' mind. At the end, the story cannot express any feeling (the music is not suitable for the mood too).In conclude, the whole anime is disappointing. The reason is not about how bad it is, it's about how Makoto fail to be an artist, and a stylist he could be.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great great movie,"Although i was expecting a better end i really did enjoy this movie. The animation was top notch and the way the plot ran smoothly was also great. I love both of the characters because they both are very unique in their way. I definitely see why this is considered one of the best anime films of all time. It's fun, entertaining and also very heartwarming at times. This is a must watch if you dont know the next movie to watch.

Pretentiously boring,"Don't understand the high rating, as it is, don't get me wrong, beautifully animated, but there were just so many plotholes to the story that it was difficult to engage yourself into it. Questions like how were they able to switch bodies, and why they forget their names were all not explained. It just seems like lazy writing to me as some things were set up too coincidently, like how they meet up at the end of the film. Also the comet struck the place twice is also very unlikely and have to suspend your believe too much. The town eventually got wiped out, but is it not like groundhog day that they could try to save the town over and over again, until it works? Just with a romantic plot line just doesn't cut it, and the romantic plot is very thin aswell and wasn't enough to get me invested. Very forgettable storyline.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

Why is it always the trains in the end?,"Where to even start? Maybe by saying that ""Your Name"" is truly a masterpiece.This is probably the movie which had me go through the widest range of emotions ever. I went from laughing at some scenes to feeling excited, surprised, nervous, joy, bittersweet... it even had me cheering for the main characters at times. The end result is a movie which moved me like no other anime before.From the very beginning the movie got me hooked with an interesting story and it kept me glued to the screen for the whole one hundred and six minutes. The characters are amazingly well written and probably the best part of the anime, which says a lot because the animation and art is just out of this world. I can say with confidence that ""Your Name"" is one of the most beautiful animes I have ever seen. Back to the characters, I love the two protagonists and seeing how they develop through the movie is a joy to watch. The side characters are also interesting and charming.With all said, the anime is the best one I have seen yet, and will probably stay that way for a long time. It's been seven years since its release and I can't believe I only watched it now. A masterpiece which I can not recommend enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Haven't been touched so much by an anime movie since Spirited Away!,"Going into this film I knew the last scene. And that was because a problem I had with a subtitle so I had to check the last phrase of dialogue to make sure it was fully synchronized. Even though having that in my mind I cried 3 times while watching this movie. I can honestly say it was one of the best movie experiences I've ever had in my life. I haven't been so moved (at least by an anime movie) ever since I saw Spirited Away.The plot of this movie is pretty simple and the movie lets you know it from the first minute. Having said that there is so much going on and the pacing of the movie was so good, that the 1 hour and 46 minutes flew by without even noticing it. The first act was a bit more funny as the two tried to find balance within this weird situation. The second and third act however were where things begin to fall apart and quite fantastic things happen that move you, inspire you, touch you, surprise you and maybe even shock you. The funny thing about watching this movie and about my experience watching this movie is that about two years ago I've read a very interesting book about relationships and how to have a good relationship (I mean as a couple). One of the main things that stood out to me from that book was this thing: ""Love your future partner even before you met him"". And I don't know why, but while I was watching this movie I was reminded of that. For me this movie reminded me of the fact that even though you might not yet have found THAT partner, It will come and when it comes be ready to already love him and pursue that dream of being with him/her.As for technical aspects of the movie, I was astonished with how good was the animation even though it was hand made, at times some shots looked like a short real video. Absolutely stunning animation. The music was also incredible with an amazing soundtrack (musical score) and also songs with voice that were hart breaking especially due to the fact that the scenes they were in were superb as well.I can't find a single flaw with this movie. The only thing that bugged me a little was the complexity of the story especially from the second to third act. Aside from that this movie was superb in every way and it is the kind of movie that reminds us about beautiful things in life and how we can achieve those things if we pursue them and love them. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Finally, there is a grounded focus on Taki and his life, only for fantasy stuff to completely derail the story.It may be my lack of understanding of Japanese culture that made me under appreciate the story, but I found the culture in the Tale of the Princess Kaguya remarkable.I do admire the message about the human need for intimacy and love.Overall, I felt the story was too complex and under focused.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

prepare a whole box of tissues,"It is unimaginable to see how just an animation can portray many emotions and feel alive. This film gives off a magical vibe, but a different one than what we see on Disney and other fantasy romance films out there that we have grown into. This one is a 10/10 not just because of the plot but also for its creativity and production. They really do take animation seriously in Japan.I am a sucker for Asian romantic movies and series but nothing beats Makoto Shinkai's animated romantic fantasy film. The plot twist was the most unusual and unforgettable twist that I have watched throughout my life, it was well thought out and this film is proof that romantic genres can deviate from the predictable plots, improve cliche storylines and be exceptional by integrating it with other genres.I also want to mention the creativity and production of this movie. Every detail of the animation was breathtaking and nostalgic. I admired the realistic places that they included in the film set which gives a connection between the film and the audience watching it. Also, the unrealistic events that they have in the film made me hope that it could possibly happen in real life.The soundtracks used in the film were performed by the Japanese band Radwimps. It was beautifully composed, the orchestra sounds were very majestic, and it added emotions to the film. Whenever I long for the love story of the two characters, I listen to all of the soundtracks included in the movie.Everyone would like a continuation of the story but the film ended pretty completely and gave us a sense of relief when the character had the chance to reunite. The director was kind enough to not give a cliffhanger but also not impossible to have a sequel.As for some debatable topics, this movie is heavily criticized by people who had gotten into watching anime earlier and would say that the storyline is not that shocking, and much more anime has better twists. I would say that this film might not be number one but it sure is included in the top films and has a memorable storyline. Prepare a bucket to shed your tears onto.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Your Name is a Masterpiece,"Your Name is a film that captivates its audience from beginning to end with its superb and incredibly unique storyline. The body swap genre is one that has been explored in various films, but the way it was intertwined with a love story in Your Name is brilliant. What sets this film apart is its refusal to hold the audience's hand. The first act is dedicated to determining what exactly is going on, and this ambiguity only serves to make the movie better. The final act is incredible, with high stakes and quiet moments that help the audience process the intense emotion the characters are experiencing. There is so much to like here, and I truly think it is one of the best animated screenplays ever created.The performances in ""Your Name"" are also noteworthy. Watching the dubbed version, I felt that everyone did a fantastic job. The chemistry between the characters was superb, and nothing was overly acted, which is a problem in some anime. The voice actors managed to convey the emotions of the characters without overdoing it, making the performances feel natural and believable.The direction in Your Name is nothing short of amazing. There were so many unique scenes that can only be done in animation, and each one was painstakingly crafted in such a way that portrays the larger narrative. The animation itself was breathtaking, with fantastic landscapes and 3D integration. It is the best animated visuals I think I have ever seen.In conclusion, Your Name is a masterpiece that deserves all the praise it has received. Its unique storyline, great performances, and stunning visuals make it a must-watch for anyone who loves animation. The film's direction is impeccable, and the attention to detail is outstanding. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to experience a heartfelt, emotional journey that they will never forget.Score: 98%

Now I can honestly say this film definitely lives up to its hype. The character development outstandingly good, the premise was on a whole new level of excellence.

I'm not a big fan of romance nor drama. I decided to eventually give it a try due to the quarantine, and it exceeded my expectations greatly.My only issue with the movie is that it starts slow and gives the impression of a simple romantic drama. I didn't mind much since it drew me more into the story and the character's life, but my husband was extremely bored, so I suppose it's not for everyone.But the plot twist in the middle! Wow! I didn't see it coming. I was at the end of my chair until the movie ended. I especially noticed that they kept the characters reactions not over the top like it's done in so many Animes, it gave a more realistic feeling and felt more like watching a movie and not a cartoon.

One of If Not The Best Anime of All Time,"Masterpiece of an anime that is almost perfect in every aspect of it, from amazing animation, incredible soundtracks, interesting concept, and an engaging story, this anime have it allyou know an anime have an incredible art when every frame of it is a wallpaper worthy picture and that is the case with Kimi No Na wa, it looks breathtaking & eye pleasing every single seconds of it, the way they did lighting and shading is just so perfect it gives off this semi realistic look while still keeping it animatedThe animation for this movie is nothing ground breaking but its still pretty impressive and looks pretty smooth.. its worthy enough for a cinema releaseThe soundtrack is incredible, im not just talking about the main OST's with vocal singing in em, im talking about the OST's as a whole including the instrumentals that plays in the background of the moviethe concept is pretty interesting as it takes the word ""Soul-Mate"" and took it literally, its a simple premise and concept but its interesting enough for me to keep watching till the endThe story is pretty engaging especially after the the second act of the movies (i dont wanna spoil anything so i wont say much about it)this anime is the anime that made me realized that anime is an art form and not just something for kids to enjoy but also for grown ups.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Any drug which erases a part of your memory?,I just want to experience watching this movie for the first time. Breathing.

"Can't reach the heights it aspires to, but quite close this time","Here is another gorgeous Shinkai film with a fantastic premise and so-so execution. That being said, it does work on a number of levels and those are clearly resonating with so many that have seen it and turned it into a global phenomenon.The first act is presented as a bit of a jumble without the cinematic language necessary to key in the audience smoothly and completely leaves out one side of the story before concluding in a montage sequence that feels far too early. After a major revelation in the second act, it was clear to me why the film started lopsided but that justification is terribly misguided. Sadly, I was not surprised as Shinkai's consistent issue has been story structure, pacing, and tying major points together in a satisfying way. The film's final act just doesn't get all the way there in tying off it's ends, preventing me from sinking into this metaphysical scenario the way that I wanted to.His latest work, as of this writing, Suzume, is I think his first truly great film and you should seek it out.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Astonishing,"I don't have any words for how beautiful and perfect this film was. The animation is out of this world, sometimes I couldn't see a difference to real life. The story was wonderful and it has a great plot, it really surprised me. It bypassed all my expectations. The music matched the scenes it was played to and it made me feel like I was right there with Taki and Mitsuha. I would recommend this film to everyone, to people who love watching anime but also to people who never watched an anime before in their life.

Best anime I've ever seen,"This is without a doubt my favorite anime of all time possibly my favorite movie in general. The story line has you on edge for the entire show. Plus this movie really gets you in the feels and when it ends you want to watch it over and over again until your finally satisfied. The detail is just incredible, some scenes are just wonderful to look at on a 32 inch tv. The amount of time spent on making this has to be the best use of time in the entire wide world. Now I'm a pretty stone cold guy but this show hits that very small romantic side and bursts it into crazy emotion. This is the longest revie I've ever wrote which should tell you something about how good it is. This show is worth the watch any time over any movie. I give you my word",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Hates country life, adores city life and so...","Consciously or unconsciously, the writer of this movie hates country/village life and adores big city life.The writer destroys the whole beautiful village but then get emotional, but still destroys it but saves all the residents and move them to the city.The main character, the girl, shouts out loud how she hates living in the country side and how she miserably want to live in the big city, Tokyo.The movie shows Tokyo as a clean, happy, wonderful city. Of course every big capital has good sides, but it is mostly dirty, dark, depressing, overcrowded and indicates many homeless and so much unhappy people. And the public transport! Yeah, definitely it doesn't look beautiful as is in the movie! Especially in rush hours....
I feel like the writer roots with the main guy that lives in the city and although he hates living in country side and adores city life, he still desires a girl/ future wife from the country side. Maybe, he got bored of the city born woman and start to imagine something like this, I don't know....
Anyhow the animation style, although mostly unnecessarily too bright and looks fake in some CGI looking parts, overall it is beautifull and it was what made me finish the movie. Otherwise, the story is so st.pid and boring and meaningless.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

The greatest animated piece of story telling yet to be made,"I seldom find myself in need of telling others what to watch and why, nor do I think a movie can touch everyone the same way. But this movie is something else.It's simply a love story masterpiece with a force which pulls you in like no other. The animation is breathtaking and the characters so palpable you might forget you're watching something animated. For the first time in my life I felt this movie move me throughout my entire body. When the credits rolled I broke down in awe of that sensation. Now, I don't expect everyone to share this experience for obvious reasons. But if you find the time. Do watch this masterclass in storytelling and cinema. For no movie will ever haunt me in such a beatiful way ever again.Do yourself this favor.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Incredibly vivid, original and beautiful","This is not normally a movie or anime that would fit my taste of genres. However upon recommendation from social media I decided to give this a whirl.Absolutely mind blowing the level of detail the animators have poured into this masterpiece. I honestly paused a few scenes just to admire the dedication the animators did to cross every t and dot every i. The story itself is original and captivating which had me stuck on my seat. The voice actors also need to take a bow because I genuinely felt myself immersed in the timeline of events and importantly, feeling what the characters were experiencing emotionally too.Ask yourself, when was the last movie you watched where all your expectations were blown out the water because this is what 'Your Name' did to me and many others.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A great story, a greater teller","This movie proves once again that CGI and SFX might make a movie nice for your eyes, your mind however, desires something else.
Finally (after a long long time of movies with stolen ideas) a unique story and a great one. so special, and refreshing.The story here may be good, but the way it is being told is far greater. Having a map of secrecy, revealing information and new founding piece by piece with patient without losing the audience's attention.
Keeping the audience, not in superior position, neither inferior position, but with as much knowledge as the protagonists, ""glues"" them to the screen and create sympathy with the protagonists since they share the same will: Figuring out what the hell is happening.Every part, every detail in this amazing story serving a general goal up ahead in the story progression map, another fact that makes the audience forget how to walk while watching the movie.Thank you for bringing this idea in to life.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A movie for the heart,"There is a oftenly uttered (I cannot name it as a cliché) sad notion: If you lose someone when you are little or if a very long time passed since that moment, you cannot remember who that person was. That is how i fell about my grandmothers. I can't remember how they sounded like, what did they like, why they were angry. I can only remember vague things like how would one prepare a meal or how would other frown over my misbehaviour. These thoughts makes me feel sad and a little bit lost.
I followed this train of thought when i watched this movie. Japanese movies and animes usually follow these kinds of uncanny but strong sentiments and when done right(not too streched thin like in long-running animes), it is bullseye. Those men now how to manipulate my feelings. I have felt seperation and forgetting something i longed for.
It had some dorky and pervy humor of animes, some metphysical aspects to complete the recipe and at the end we had an emotionally moving piece to enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
