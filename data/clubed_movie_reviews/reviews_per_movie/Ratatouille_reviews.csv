A First Rate Film,"I just saw ""Ratatouille"" tonight.It's a first class movie. Several thoughts come to mind...-The character performances are so good, I think there's no sort of movie they couldn't make. I've heard Pixar's John Carter of Mars is going to be live action? No! I want them to do it all animated.-""Cars"" definitely _was_ a lower-value softball they threw to finish out that original Disney-gets-half-of-everything-plus-sequel-rights contract they were in at the time. I remember all the clucking last summer about how Pixar had lost its way.-There were a few moments when they seemed to lose that stylized reality they had established and things looked merely ""real"".-There was one scene in the latter part of the film where I thought ""I can't believe they are doing this tired movie cliché"" but they pulled out of it at the last second and made it something new.-The 2D-ish end credits were great. Stick it out to the very end to see the mo-cap disclaimer!-With this, Brad Bird is certainly one of the animation gods now.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Incredible,"Remember how everyone was talking about Toy Story when it first came out? The incredible visuals, unique style, vividly imagined world? The next time people were talking that way with such enthusiasm about a computer animated movie was Finding Nemo. I'm excited to say that Ratatouille will be the next one to redefine the visual creativity and technical detail of computer animated movies. Honest to goodness, I was awestruck by the animation, and that never happens to me. It is a visual masterpiece of a movie if ever the term applies.The next thing to talk about is the ""genre"" of the movie. As Pixar enthusiasts will tell you, Brad Bird, the director of Ratatouille, also directed The Incredibles, which has the most inspired and creative action sequences from any of the Pixar movies. Ratatouille, while not so straightforward with its action, has almost as much as The Incredibles did, in unique ways. Most memorable is the shotgun scene near the beginning. (You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it). Other than that, this is the expected comedy-with-heart movie from Pixar that so many have grown to love.The voice acting? Spot on. Every voice is distinctive, and it never feels like a celebrity's voice tacked on to a character (Shrek, I'm looking at you), it feels like the characters themselves speaking. You can't ask for more from voice acting.And finally, the script and the story. The entire irony of the story -- a street rat with a passion for fine food -- is beautiful, and a tight, smart, wonderful script flows from this. The pacing of the story is odd and choppy at places, but this is a very forgivable grievance. The only other minor fault is that a few of the dramatic one-liners feel a bit forced. Other than that, this is the most layered, complex, and satisfying script from Pixar since The Incredibles.Overall, I recommend that everyone see this movie when it hits theaters (I was lucky enough to see a pre-release screening). Though not perfect, it is an animated masterpiece in true Pixar form with breathtaking animation and visual design.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Excellent movie!,"Tonight I went to see Ratatouille during a preview offered to Myspace users in Boston. Overall the movie was GREAT! It was really funny, often in unexpected places, the storyline kept you engaged the entire time and the overall mood was lighthearted and inspiring. A real ""feel-good"" movie. I admit I was a bit skeptical going in, I mean the idea of a rat in a kitchen kind of left me queasy, but I left the theater excited to see it again when it is released. The voice actors are excellent and the animation is amazing. I've been to Paris before and the overall views were very accurate. At times I could tell exactly where in the city the events were taking place. Overall a fabulous movie, I highly recommend it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pulls the most out of an okay story,"Ratatouille is a major step up from a lot of last year's animated fare, and a vast improvement from last year's Oscar winner for best animated feature. Here we re-discover sweet simplicity amped up with the expected story-telling techniques of Pixar, and here's the kicker, no heavy handed messages hammered in with a drill, but there certainly is a message and it's delivered with subtler grace despite some flaws. Although, aspects to the message are borderline confusing if you over analyze the reality that occurs in the film, but the film doesn't scream for over-analyzation in the same fashion as ""Finding Nemo"". For me, the animation slightly overpowers the story, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. The film is directed, camera-wise, with the same interesting techniques as ""Happy Feet"", but the film has more in store. We get to see the world mainly from Remmy's perspective, and it's visually exciting. The camera-work is what makes the film's physical humor work so well. More on the artistic scheme, the film looks really great. Particularly the lighting stands out. The colors are very lush and detailed; very accurate toward a real city-scape. Then the rat's fur are very impressive, it moves against the wind and gets wet very much like real rat hair. Don't let the detail in the clothes get past you either. The film manages to find a balance between superficial realism and animated characters. The character designs for the humans are marvelous (Bird seems to get much humor out of the smaller villains as seen in the past ""Incredibles"" and the non-Pixar film ""Shrek"") and the rats, while moving a lot like real rats still have acceptable personalities and animated form. So we feel like we're entering an animated world that is fleshy and real. Speaking of such, other animated marvels are the organic forms of the food. As real as the food in the film is, the film rightfully capture the spirit of the plot it pursues. It introduces the viewer into the world of fine-dinning and develops something rare in today's animation, a bleeding heart.Story-wise, that's the only area where I can detect any trace of criticism. I felt at times, dare I say it, that the emotion was a little bit forced. There were just certain times I didn't understand a certain character's frustration. Also, I felt uneasy about the films unusual balance of fantasy and realistic themes, such as how the reactions to rats were carried our toward the end of the film and how it blends into the films major theme and other suspend disbelief occurrences. That lack of coherent continuity gives a writer a lot more flexibility in how to tell the story. In other words, it's kind of a shortcut. But it's an observation that is made up for by other successes in the film. The film very impressively for an animated film delivers some conventional themes with a little more depth (to truly enjoy it, I'd recommend erasing the fact that rats often carry disease from your mind). It's cute without embarrassingly forcing it and unpretentious. The very fact that what makes it work may fly over the heads of small children isn't a reason to condemn it. It's true though that I feel that younger kids may get a little restless halfway though, and not just through my own experience at the theater. however, this is another great film for an older audience to enjoy a simple well told story. As for whether it will have that lasting effect that Pixar films usually carry, only time will tell.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"An Amazing film, made for film lovers, with an artistic/indie appeal","I caught a sneak peak yesterday, and must say, this film is a classic. It is not as flashy as cars, or as action packed as Incredibles, but it is a masterpiece of restraint and heart, that matches the classics from the golden age of the film industry. Pixar has always been groundbreaking for smart and fun animated features, but Ratatouille might just be what puts them over the top as one of the BEST all around film-making teams in history.Ratatouille is a treat for film lovers. It feels like a classic. The animationis absolutely beautiful, especially the scenery of Paris which evoked awes from the audience, as if we were seeing a grandiose fireworks show.The story is oh so classy and universal, especially when you look at it as a parable to yourself and society. Sometimes the story seems familiar, yet it is packed with so much genuine heart and individuality, that it might even be too ""indie"" for most audiences. But those who are patient and willing to open their minds and hearts, even when it may challenge the viewers to rethink their own personal biases, will find within this entertaining, sweet, simple film a remarkable message about challenging societal norms and not letting anything stand in your way of your dreams. When you follow your dreams, you never know what an impact it will have upon you, or those you might encounter on the journey. Just see the film, and be open to its message, and I am sure if you allow it too, it will touch you as well.P.S. : The short in front of the feature is the funniest animated short film pixar has ever done, so even if ratatouille might not be as flashy as many might want it to be, the short film will have everyone in stitches, as it did our entire theater. So just go and see it, and be prepared for a wonderful two hours.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Hyper Reality,"Its easy to see how this story came about. Animators are puppeteers first. So if you asked an animator to come up with a story, naturally you will find two features: one would involve two on-screen characters, one the animator of the other. We have many jokes associated with how imperfectly the on-screen animator (our hero) works his puppet at first. Incidentally, this movie is preceded in the theater by a short: ""Lifting."" It features a novice ""animator"" of precisely this type, being graded. Notice the infinite panel of switches in that short.Count on Pixar to find yet another way to fold introspection into the form. This is elaborated by the character of a critic. We see him first in a coffin-like office. He's only capable of destruction it seems. Voiced by Peter O'Toole in a stentorian voice-about-theater, he likes what he sees (tastes). Its a great trick you see. Usually this trick is in the form of an on screen audience watching some sort of climactic performance. When they cheer, we do too, as we become folded into the story.In this case, that is handled by a place made for us and occupied by ""the critic."" So we have a place in the story for the animator and the viewer. What else? We'll need a place for the animation, right? And we have it.It appears first as a book by a now dead, corpulent chef. This book, natch, comes alive. Look how ""Ted's law"" is followed: the distance between the ""real"" world of ourselves and the animated movie is the same as that from the animated movie and the ""living cartoon"" within. Its an explicit fold. And the fact that the inner cartoon has an open, personal feel to it conveys to the personal feel we are intended to have with the Pixar movie.So these three folds: in the story is the story, the animator and the viewer. And the introductory short sets this up too.Having said that, there are a couple noteworthy segments. In terms of the actual craft, Pixar has two areas in which it innovates.One of these in how space is handled. The Pixar guys realized early on that if the three dimensions are going to be modeled anyway, you can zip the camera around in new ways. Early in the game they did this in an overt way. That's been picked up by the summer action films, the best of them, including the Depp pirate business. (Another Disney project benefiting from the eye motion lab.)You can see this throughout the project: there are both all sorts of well managed, unusual perspectives, and a constant overlay of new shots. By this I mean that every shot is just a little different than what you've seen. Just a little canted. A little closer perhaps. A little movement that a physical camera cannot do well.But there are some big production sequences as well. I'm particularly interested in architectural water. Its a unique cinematic challenge. Its not one done well in animation because the mathematics of simply making water look real is daunting. Pixar has done what needs to be done: they have made water hyper-real, dramatic. There's a sequence here that is something like that Pinnochio sequence of 67 years ago with the whale. But its so new and fresh and exciting. Look at the water and see that it has a million tiny agents all seeking to be angry  to do damage but never reaching consensus on just how to attack. This alone is worth the admission.There's another thing that is uniquely Pixar: how characters move. Its a tricky thing, that. As with the water, it is not ever enough that they move realistically. You can make realistic movements by outfitting actors with sensors and translating that to the created beings. It captures nuance. And if you have a particularly skilled source actor, he or she will move not as a real person would, but as an actor would to convey reality. Real isn't real. We need hyperreal in special ways to get- read the reality.The credits of this movie ostentatiously say that """"Our Quality Assurance Guarantee: 100% Genuine Animation! No motion capture or any other performance shortcuts were used in the production of this film."" You can see it. We are entering a new era where both the cameras and the characters can use dramatic motions not possible with human eyes and bodies.Its a challenge for viewers. What do we accept as embodiment? So far, the answer is that the non-natural movements must always be in the service of conveying or seeming natural. But I imagine at the speed this is developing, we may soon see something more.One character note: Colette is voiced by the remarkable Janeane Garofalo. As with our hero, she has that French nose. As the love develops between these two, she becomes decidedly more sexy, both in voice and appearance. Its the appearance that I remark on here. Its all done with postures and a motorcycle. That motorcycle is there in part to allow her to bend forward, and change her lower anatomy.These folks at Pixar are good. Darn good. Glad its Steve Jobs as the creative inspiration instead of that evil other guy.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar's best yet !,"Fantastic ! ... Can't wait to get the DVD ! The technical / animation / lighting ..etc aspects of the film are awesome.

That along with having great characters/animation/dialog, which you just forget ... or never even consider are digital puppets.The humor was great too, the gags / situations character acting all contributing to making situations that ""kids of all ages "" could ""get"".There is on one level the entire story, of Remy and Linguini, but then there are 3 or 4 or more subplots and a number of dramatic scene changes which almost felt like separate chapters of the main story. That all contributed ..for me at least... to keeping the movie very interesting right to the end.While I found a few things predictable, there were also quite a few twists and and unexpected events / scenes, that just kept giving me more new ""stuff"" to enjoy 10 / 10 Mike",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
This First Quality Film of the Summer,"Brad Bird's ""Ratatouille"" is a rich, textured film that explores several important themes while sustaining a strong moral core. The lead character, Remy, a rat with ironically refined tastes in matters culinary, embodies the film's adamantly pro-democratic theme of ""anyone can cook"" while overcoming anxieties about himself and his relationship with the humans of the restaurant that despise him (because he is a rat) or distrust him. Bird handles these matters with care and deliberateness, thus providing a powerful primer for the film's target audience on American democracy and the egalitarian can-do notion at its core.""Ratatouille's"" ideas about democracy revolve around Remy's relationship with humans. As it were humans are a necessity for Remy. He needs them to do what he does best: cook fine cuisine. He needs them to provide the ingredients. He needs them to handle the chores of cooking. He needs them to appreciate the food he creates. Thus, he forms a reluctant partnership with a young kitchen worker named Linguini who can provide a link to the world of fine cuisine and do his culinary buddings. Since their relationship must be kept secret (for obvious reasons), they become close friends, depending on each other for their dreams.Nevertheless, Remy's relationship with humans is not always so positive. In one particularly revealing scene, Remy's father tries to scare the prodigal rat into returning to the nestwhere he belongs. He brings Remy to a rat extermination shop where several rat corpses are displayed in the front window as advertisement. The scene frightens Remy into seeing that humans are indeed a threat to him and his kind. However, Remy soon sees through his father's intimidating tactics and recognizes that fear is a tool that imprisons us and keeps us from growing (an apt thematic turn considering the current culture of fear our news and broadcast media conveys). Remy refuses to succumb to his father's mistrust of humans and bravely confronts them in order to bring his dream of cooking wonderful foods (of giving something to the world rather than taking) to full fruition. He is an intrepid little rat with the courage to pursue his selfless dream.What a beautiful message this is. What a wonderful lesson for a child to learn. Unfortunately, ""Ratatouille's"" box office draw will undoubtedly pale in comparison to Michael Bay's ""The Transformers"" and its ilk. This is unfortunate. Of course, ""The Transformers"" serves a purpose too. It initiates its young male audience into the world of consumerism, materialism, chauvinism, and violence. It reminds us that there are terrible threats to our world and they must be conquered through violent action. It also teaches us that young men can and should find contentment in consumption. These are all important parts of American culture as well. So, I guess it's up to you as to which kind of ideals you want your child (and yourself) exposed to. That's the beauty of a democracy I suppose.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A fantastic story that adds to Pixar's stellar reputation,"I checked out a sneak preview of Ratatouille last night, and I must say I truly loved this movie. Everything from the animation to the score to the voice acting to the story (and especially the story) was EXCELLENT.I don't know if it appeals to kids as much as other Pixar offerings, but this one upholds their legacy of excellence.Casting Patton Oswalt as Remy was PERFECT. The rest of the voice cast was outstanding as well...including Pixar ""house voice"" John Ratzenberger. See if you can tell which guy he is without foreknowledge (as in, don't read the cast list).Michael Giacchino's score was as perfect for this story as the award-winning one he created for ""The Incredibles"" and the incredible music he has created for most of J.J. Abrams' recent projects, including ""Alias"" and ""Lost"".Even with my 3-year-old son making it really hard to concentrate, and our ""we got to the theater late and had to sit up front"" seats, this movie was fantastic. Everyone should go see it, even if they don't have kids.Brad Bird - you done right by us movie fans again...Ratatouille is great!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of Pixar's best,"This film is exactly what Pixar needed to steal the thunder from Dreamworks' latest release, SHREK III. In many ways, this is very ironic, as one of Pixar's best films, MONSTERS INC., was overwhelmed when it was released due to the first SHREK's success. I honestly think if SHREK hadn't been such a wonderful movie, people would have noticed that MONSTERS INC. was an exceptional film. Now, Pixar gets some payback with one of their best, RATATOUILLE.Actually, RATATOUILLE is probably Pixar's best film, though I did enjoy TOY STORY II and THE INCREDIBLES. The reason I was so overwhelmed by this story was that it was so highly original and creative--I simply cannot compare the plot to any other film (something you can do with THE INCREDIBLES and TOY STORY II). Plus, after years of making CG movies, the look is taken to a whole new level in this film--it just looks breathtaking.Now I need to point out that RATATOUILLE is not as much a kid's movie as its predecessors. Sure, it can be enjoyed by the kids, but the story line is a tad darker and covers an adult concept (illegitimate birth) and includes a swear word (though not one the really ""bad"" ones, you can be sure). Also, while the rats are kind of cute (and a marketer's dream), most of the rest of the story isn't and there are no catchy kid's tunes. No, instead this film is aimed more at teens and adults in its sensibilities--something that really helped make SHREK a financial gold mine and cursed MONSTERS INC. to be seen (incorrectly) as ""just a kid's movie"".Amazing animation, excellent writing and, the rarest of rare, a completely original and captivating plot make this a winner and film that will be long remembered. I can't wait to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Another Disney-Pixar Masterpiece!,"This film is fantastic! Pixar has yet another great film to add to their impressive repertoire. Oscar-winning director and screenwriter Brad Bird, who wrote and directed ""The Incredibles"", has produced a film with subtle humor, heart, and very profound truth. The voice actors are so great, and it is especially great to hear Peter O'Toole on the screen. The animation is beautiful and it is all around an excellently made film. Its message is one that holds so much truth for everyone, especially today's youth: it tells people that no, not anyone can do anything, but if you have the talent you don't have to be limited by your surroundings or your upbringing. I think this is refreshing to hear because often, children are lied to when they are told they can do anything, when actually not all of them can. But it offers hope to the ones who may feel limited by their social class. It also exposes the fact that most people try to put up false facades of themselves to hide who they are in order to feel accepted by the social standards we create in our society; it shows characters with this flaw, but ultimately they accept this reality and learn to be true to themselves. This thread, I think, is very common throughout the Pixar films, and they present it very well. ""Ratatouille"" is my new Disney-Pixar favorite!

Best Animated Film in Creation,"The combination of Disney and Pixar never ceases to amaze, but with Ratatouille, their newest effort, animated features are brought to new heights with the best one to date. Ratatouille is stunning, surreal while at the same time realistic, and a joy to watch. The writing is, in one word, just amazing, and the voice acting is sensational. The characters are poetic and real, and the rats are some of Disney/Pixar's cutest creations. Ratatouille is written and directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles), and features stellar voice acting from Peter O'Toole, Patton Oswalt, Ian Holm, Brian Dennehy, Lou Romano, Brad Garrett, and Janeane Garofalo.Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) is a little rat who dreams of becoming a chef just like his idol, the human Gusteau (voiced by Brad Garrett). After a mishap, Remy loses his family in the sewers and comes upon a fading restaurant that had previously been owned by Gusteau before his untimely death. He comes upon a lowly garbage boy, Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano), and together they set out to revive the once-legendary restaurant.Ratatouille is filled with loads of surprises and lots of twists and turns. The animation is even more stunning here than in some of the other Disney/Pixar productions, and the breathtaking landscape of Paris, France, really adds a layer of realism to the film. The food looks so real and delicious, and the humans and rats look incredibly realistic. Remy and Linguini are both lovable characters, and the audience is rooting for them the entire way. Surprisingly enough, this movie is the funniest of the Disney/Pixar films, with very subtle and unique humor.As previously stated, the voice acting really makes the film different, and each actor is perfectly suited to his or her role. The best among the bunch happens to be Lou Romano, as he deals with his character extremely well and is incredibly believable. There are times when the acting and animation is so excellent that you forget you are watching an animated film altogether. Brad Garrett is actually tolerable for once, and is excellent in his role as Gusteau, who acts as Remy's conscience for the majority of the film. Some of the funniest scenes in the movie are rooted from Gusteau's chats with Remy and many others come from the relationship between Linguini and Remy. On another note, Patton Oswalt does a magnificent job voicing Remy, and Peter O' Toole is very memorable as Anton Ego, the food critic for 'The Grim Eater'.Overall, you can't ask for a better film than Ratatouille, a new classic from Disney/Pixar that is filled with humor, amazing animation, and, most importantly, lots of heart. Some of the scenes are so poetic and perfect that they just bring tears to your eyes. It may be hard to believe, but Ratatouille is far better than any other animated films you will see this year, or perhaps that you will ever see. It manages to be better than Toy Story, better than Finding Nemo, even better than the fantastic Meet the Robinsons. I saw a pre-screening of the film on Saturday, June 16, but I cannot wait to see it again once it hits theaters everywhere on June 29. See Ratatouilleit is highly original, heartwarming, uplifting, and a very thrilling movie that has to be the best animated feature of the last few decades.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Could this GET any better?!?,"Disney and Pixar have done it again. They've combined their amusing + universal story, sprinkled on some killer animation, added a dash of perfect voice acting, and sautéed it to make very endearing main character, who will appeal to children and adults alike. The end result has been astounding.Remy (Patton Oswalt), is a small rat with big dreams. Where the other rats have a passion for food, Remy has a passion for COOKING food. He aspires to become like his role model and idol: Gusteau - the best chef in all of Paris. After Remy loses his family, he finds himself face to face with Gusteau's restaurant - which is now slowly losing its 5 Star reputation. Unfortunately for Remy, his hero Gusteau suddenly passed away, leaving Remy pondering on what to do. When Remy bumps into Linguini (Lou Romano), the garbage boy, they set out on an adventure together, to discover themselves, to discover secrets, and most importantly, to discover the art of real cooking.The animation is stunning. It is so realistic that it's unbelievable, every little detail has been perfected, and each twist and turn of the story pulls on your heartstrings.Each actor voicing over does a great job, each one is well suited for their role, especially Lou Romano as Linguini - the chemistry between Remy and Linguini was fantastic! Just with the voice, an audience is able to identify with the characters, and view the superb chemistry these two actors, by just listening to their voices. Either way, it really worked for Ratatouille!In conclusion, Disney Pixar have a new bestseller family film on their list, following Toy Story, Shrek, and Finding Nemo. Ratatouille will earn a place in your heart.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Cute,"Ratatouille isn't as good as some of the other Pixar entries, in my personal opinion, but it's still a pretty good movie. It's perhaps a little bit too long and tries to do a little bit too much. As far as emotions are concerned, this film doesn't really do a whole lot in that area, which is a real shame because one of PIxar's most potent weapons was the ability to make an audience feel strong emotions and react emotionally to the things transpiring on screen. This movie was absolutely brilliant from an animation point of view and really continues the upwards trajectory of raising the bar not just for their own productions, but also for the future of animated film in general.
It just felt a little overdone in some places and undercooked (if I may say that) in others. It didn't connect with me in quite the same way that other Pixar films did. Not to say it's a bad movie, because it was an enjoyable experience for me... it just didn't offer as much resonance as their other entries.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Among the Greatest Animated Features,"The absolutely absurd premise of a rat becoming a great French chef is brought to fruition by Pixar.

Fun Mediocrity,"This is not a home run in the Pixar/Disney Hall of Fame, but it IS enjoyable.RATATOULLE lacks soul, heart, and frivolities, which normally draw children and adults alike by the droves. This film is a romantic sort, as are most Disney animated features, with the Comedy factor omitted from the formula this time, and the movie suffers for it.It was only moderately interesting and somehow managed to be quaint without endearing itself to its target audience. Some adults will particularly like this due to the adult themes and elements, but the age group who are out there attempting to make it on their own like the lead character in this work, will not be attracted to this venue.This sad fact is negated; however, by the fact that this film did only marginally less at the box office, than the widely loved (and vastly superior) Cars. It is further negated by the fact that RATATOULLE receives a user rating here at IMDb.com, which surpasses Cars by laps. Deservedly so, in my opinion. RATATOULLE is a wonderful film, but it lacked the magic of the rest of its line.All in all? I sincerely hope this does not turn out to be the beginning of a trend into decline.

Tasty (but more like a Big Mac than like great french cuisine).,"""Ratatouille"" is really clever, entertaining and, of course, very ""well done"" (from a technical aspect, beside Squaresoft, no animation studio can reach Pixar's level). But, is it enough to make a good movie ? I'm not sure, and Pixar itself seems to have lowed down its standards here, in order to be more in a classical Disney's tradition.Don't get me wrong, some ideas are brilliant : especially when the rat ""pupetmastered"" the human, or the touching ending with the critic's critic, or the Head Cheaf's characters, who is very funny, etc. But somehow, the story - and especially the human's parts, who seems paradoxically less human than the fishes, the monsters or the toys of other's movies - lack of the deep you normally supposed to find in a Pixar movie. The mousse tries to hides inside a rat's figure, but you still can see the disneyen's hears of the animal. The all moral aspect is for instance very shallow (and furthermore, it's almost Shrek one : no matter what you are, if you try hard enough, you can become what you truly are).Of course, it's far better than the last other's American animation's studio's recent works, but its far more childish than, say, ""The Incredibles"", witch was directed by the same Brad Bird. I also was quite disappointed by ""Cars"", and I have the feeling that Pixar's singularity and originality is a little lost, replaced by the dominant classical Disney's moral.Well, at least, this years, 2-D animation brings me ""The Simpsons : The movie"", and I'm gonna watch it one more time, waiting for the sequel more than the next Pixar's movie.PS : For Animation's fans and movies'lovers, ""Persepolis"" is also a must-see of the year : there's more than American's 3D in the cartoon's life...",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Another paycheck for Brad Bird,"So I just watched Ratatouille on DVD. Like Incredibles, I dismissed this as another lame Pixar movie and saw Spidey 3 instead(big mistake).But I gave Incredibles a chance and ended up enjoying it a little more than I thought. So I thought the same would happen with this movie. I was wrong.The story was boring. Really boring. Boring and predictable. Boring, predictable, and way too long. Incredibles had a deep engaging story that kept me hooked. Ratatouille had two stories that went nowhere. Remy trying to realize his dreams of being a chef, and Linguini trying to realize his dream of not being a tool. It seemed like a good formula, well it would have if we haven't seen it in 2000+ other movies. And every 10 minutes they had to keep reminding us what's the plot of the story, because they were that bad at showing it.The characters, oh god the characters. Flat and dull. They had no charisma, nothing unique about them, nothing that will make them stand out and join the ranks of greats like Bugs Bunny and Homer Simpson. Remy was just another big dreamer type. He works hard, get's knocked down, gets back up, and achieves his dream. Good for him, now what? He has the same backstory as about 1400 other Disney characters. And Linguni, the dude was a loser. A total loser, and he's stays that way through the entire film, and yet somehow he still get's to make it with the big-nosed chick. What was he there for? His only purpose was to make Remy look good. People say Linguini had very unique movements, but all he did was spin around a lot. What's unique about that. He had no personality, and he flaunted it. And obviously his voice actor didn't even care enough to try to make him at least sound interesting. Colette, she claimed to be a tough and sassy girl in a""man's kitchen"", yet all she did was fall for the biggest loser in France. Where's her self-esteem, they did absolutely nothing with her character. It's like Pixar isn't even trying to make us care about these characters. They're one-note and easily forgettable, soon to be pushed aside for the next bland set of characters, then the cycle begins anew. And my apologies to Patton Oswalt, he's one of my favorite comedians and people in general, but the voice acting was terrible. Flat and emotionless. They honestly couldn't just get guys like Billy West and Rob Paulsen. They would have made the movie 10x more interesting.Even with the great story and characters of the Incredibles, the animation still kept the movie bogged down. Ratatouille was no different. Everything felt so mechanical, so chained down. It didn't feel fun and exciting. It just made me wonder if they weren't gonna put any effort into trying to make the animation fun, lively, and surreal, why the hell didn't they do it in live action. All it had was just some fancy camera angles, thinking that would compensate, well, it didn't. Pixar strives too hard to make they're animation look more realistic, so much so that it loses another key component, believability(spell check). They have these uber realistic atmosphere and these ultra-fake looking humans, that it clashes and makes the movie look even more fake than it is. It doesn't suck you into the world they've created, it spits you out maliciously. One of the things I liked about the movie TMNT, they built this dark, gritty, comic style atmosphere and built it around the characters, and it worked, you were in that movie, it was believable. Ratatouille wasn't.Ultimately, I'm not surprised little kids like the movie, it was geared toward them, and they're the only ones who could enjoy it. All the adults that are saying this is the best movie ever, needs to retrieve their souls from Walt Disney's cold dead hands",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Must See,"Where do I start with this? When I first saw promos for this movie, I was thinking ""Another rat movie!"" After Flushed Away, rat movies just seemed, well, bad. But after the good words from the critics, I warmed up to the idea, but was skeptical.So with my dad, I saw the movie, and boy, were my first thoughts wrong! The animation was spectacular. Some recent CGI films are just plain crud (I want to keep my review clean) in their animation. But this movie, each little bit of the animation was so professionally done. The food looked good enough to eat and the views of Paris were perfect! The acting was great too. Patton Oswalt did a spectacular job with Remy and Peter O'Toole as Anton Ego was one good decision! As for the rest of actors, they did a good job too! It's just that Patton Oswalt and Peter O'Toole stood out the most.So, um, see this movie! It is great, spectacular, off the wall, needs better reviews, you get it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A classic of the computer animation films,"To me this is one of the best animated movies of the last years. It has a very inspiring story and has a timeless signature. It has many comedy elements but is not overloaded with jokes that make reference to the present time (like Shrek).This movie integrates a very nice story, with attractive characters and the last advances in computer animation. Is a real art work in the sense that it integrates all its elements without oversizing one of them: an inspirational cartoon tale that uses the computer graphics with some elements of comedy.The facial and corporal language of the main characters is amazing. I love too that its makes reference to the typical problems that sometimes you have to get all the things you love at the same time.This movie also has many other goodies inside, but it's up to you to discover them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Bon appétit: ""Ratatouille"" serves up a feast for the senses","""Ratatouille"" is a culinary delight that is sure to satisfy even the most discerning of palates. The film, directed by Brad Bird and Jan Pinkava, tells the story of a young rat named Remy who dreams of becoming a chef. The animation is absolutely stunning and the attention to detail is unparalleled. The vibrant colors and intricate textures of the food are sure to make your mouth water.The story is heartwarming and relatable, with Remy's passion for cooking and determination to pursue his dream despite the obstacles he faces. The voice cast, led by Patton Oswalt as Remy, is spot on and brings the characters to life in a way that is both endearing and entertaining. The humor is clever and never forced, making for a truly enjoyable viewing experience.One of the standout elements of ""Ratatouille"" is its portrayal of the culinary world. The film immerses you in the bustling kitchen of a top Parisian restaurant and makes you feel like you are right there alongside Remy and his human colleagues. The film does an excellent job of showcasing the hard work, dedication, and artistry that goes into creating great food.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
You Dirty Ratatouille,"Today I had the privilege of seeing Pixar's 8 feature-length release, and the current front-runner to receive the 2007 Best Animated Oscar.That film is Ratatouille. It revolves around Remy an adorable little rodent who desires to be a great chef, and Linguine, a bumbling but well-intentioned nerd who helps Remy become a great chief. The movie begins in a French country-side house where Remy and his disapproving rat brethren (""shutup and eat your garbage"" says Remy's father when Remy complains about wanting high-quality food) are driven away by a miserable elderly French hag. Through his escape from the French hag, Remy lands in a Parisian restaurant created by a famous French chef named Gusteau. Gusteau took his own live after a bad review from a famous food critic named Anton Ego, but Gusteau still appears in Remy's imagination to offer various pieces of advice, such as ""anybody can cook"" and ""stealing is wrong"". Through Gusteau's inspiration and Linguini's bumbling nature, Remy and Linguini become cooks in a partnership that may bring Gusteau's restaurant back to it's former glory. Complicating matters are a feisty female cook, an asshole of a head chef, the reunion between Remy and his disapproving family, and snarling food critic Anton Ego.Do not be afraid of Ratatouille's 110-minute running time, this movie has a far-quicker pace that some 90-minute movies. If you are a kid, you'll love the Looney Tune-esqe slapstick. Through accident, Remy can control Linguini like a puppet by pulling on his hair. It's a real thrill to see Linguini make body motions that are completely against his will. If you are older, you will appreciate the message this movie provides: no dream is too important, if you work hard enough and never stop believing you can achieve anything. This not the first time that message has been told in an animated film, but it's a lesson that's worth repeating. That is not the only thing this movie has to tell us. Like Remy, we as humans must decide whether to go our own way or do what our family tells us. We must also decide whether it's better to be respected doing things that make us miserable or to be disrespected doing things that make us feel happy. Not since Amadeus has such an enjoyable movie asked such serious questions.I left this movie feeling really wonderful and enchanted. Enchanted because I saw the good guys get what they deserve, enchanted because I saw the jerks get what they deserve. I felt enchanted because I witnessed the marvelous performance of Peter O'Toole as the crusty but lovable food critic Anton Ego. The way Peter O'Toole used the word ""Perspective"", I couldn't help but get goosebumps, and I mean that as a high compliment.While I still await The Simpsons Movie with great anticipation, now I highly doubt it will win the Best Animated Feature Oscar, because it'll have to be really good to beat Ratatouille's magic.My grade (out of 4 stars): 4",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
My compliments to the chef!,"""Ratatouille"" is the quintessential nice movie: smooth, filling, and most of all, inspiring. It also helps that the movie immediately followed ""Cars"", which would make anything feel like a breath of fresh air, but I digress. It excites the tastebuds before going for the heartstrings, and it just feels good. Remy's culinary aspirations are super relatable and altogether human: anyone can cook.You can feel Brad Bird's theme of individualism carried over from ""The Incredibles"" and it ends up making an excellent case for one's art, integrity and just a general sense of joy in doing anything in life.It's a delight.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The best animated film ever...,"To describe Ratatouille as the best animated film ever made is still an understatement. It is a topnotch achievement--the chef d'oeuvres amidst a world of hamburgers and fries.The advanced screening of the latest collaboration of Disney and Pixar, directed by the ingenious Brad Bird, whose previous works were never disappointing (The Iron Giant and The Incredibles), was probably most anticipated by some Filipino viewers who are aware of the increasing popularity and immense critical acclaim of the Ratatouille. To paraphrase a critic, it was even hailed as the ""prophet who spreads and embodies the new age of the world of animation."" As much as I wanted to digress back then, I admit that I was giddy and excited to witness what the fuss is all about. As soon as I heard that there was a two-day advanced screening of Ratatouille, I told myself that I had to see it by hook or by crook.I went inside the theater with extremely high expectations. I was blown away--the film did not disappoint--and the critics were right. BUT more than that, watching Ratatouille is a cinematic experience--I left the cinema shivering and in awe. The last time I had the same experience was with Martin Scorsese's The Departed, the Oscar best picture last year. I won't be surprised if this--yes, animated film--gets the same honor next year.The quality of Ratatouille's animation can be compared without embarrassment to modern paintings or visual art compositions. The texture and the colors of Paris juxtaposed with the vivid outlines of the furs of the rats--combine these with excellent camera movements that follow the world of a rat adjacent to the oh-so-romantic alleys and lights of Paris--these unlikely combinations are beautifully illustrated that the audience is easily enchanted-- transported into the lovely world of Remy and Linguini: the little rat chef and the simple young man who just wanted to get by after losing his mother.The story is focused primarily on Remy, gifted with an extraordinary sense of smell which eventually developed into his keenness and sensitivity to food. That's not a problem at all if he were perfectly a normal human being--Remy is a rat, one of the icky rodents that survive in packs, stealing food, rummaging through your garbage, causing disease and infections. He feels terribly odd about his special gift, often finding himself at the kitchen of human beings, experimenting his own cooking. After a series of unfortunate events, he finds himself lost and away from his family in the sewers--luckily, these sewers are in Paris, practically a food paradise for food enthusiasts. Eventually, he meets Linguini, a recently orphaned young man who turns up at the restaurant of a former famous chef named Gusteau, who happens to be a TV chef idol of Remy during the times he snuck out to the house of humans to get the spices he needed for his cooking. Unlike Remy, Linguini's knowledge of cuisine and food is close to nothing. After being assigned as a garbage boy in the restaurant, at one time, without thinking, he spoiled a soup being prepared for the restaurant's customers. Remy intervenes and saves the soup, which will turn out to be a big sensation soon. The rat is discovered by the young man, the head chef discovers the rat and orders the young man to get rid of the rat. Of course, Linguini cannot get rid of the rat because he needs to know how the rat cooked the sensational soup. So he decides to save the rat and the soup and eventually, everybody's saved. Though that's just the basic premise of the story.The plot is solid, mixing a dash of vintage Disney archetypical hero in Remy (who reminds us of other Disney heroes who just think of themselves as different, who want to go out there, somewhere else where they will be more understood and where they are meant for greater things) and the Pixar's archetypal hero in Linguini, whose real heroism is found lingering among his inner values and natural kindness. But more than this, watching Ratatouille feels like reading a favorite bedtime story for people across all ages.What really amazes me the most is the story's utter simplicity which exceptionally utilizes and combines realism and fantasy in the lovely world of Remy and Linguini.The dialogue is extremely witty, the humor is not forced and most of the times delivered with taste.I can't wait for a second, a third, a fourth helping of Ratatouille. Yes, an original DVD will definitely be worth the entertainment feast that this luscious film offers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Wait a minute!,"Come on, people. Get hold of yourselves. Ratatouille was a nice, above-average movie, end of story. Giving it a rating of 9/10 is discrediting to yourself. Take a deep breath, relax, and stop the crusade to make Brad Bird this year's Nobel Peace Price winner. It's a decent movie! No more!It is amazing what can be created for the screen today, and this is another success for Pixar's resume. Ratatouille is unique, charming, and moves at a satisfactory pace. There is sufficient story and character development. The storyline for the film, like many of other recent animated films, is more on an adult plane than a child's. To say this was a ""kid movie"" is a misnomer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Amazing, spectacular, and perfect.","The greatest test of whether or not a film is truly admirable is how well it holds up years after its release. It has been almost three years since Ratatouille has been released and I have now seen it at least four times, maybe more. I am proud and thrilled to say that it has not lost any of its charm, still looks amazing and holds up better than almost any film I've seen as many times as I've seen this.It's hard to put your finger on, but why exactly is Pixar able to create these astonishingly good films that aren't just entertaining and delightful, although they certainly are that. They are able to tap into the very realms of the human condition, and with this bring to the surface emotions and feelings you come to not expect from an animated film because after all, animated automatically infers a film for children.Of course Ratatouille breaks that mold and I am just so pleased that I got caught up in the world of Remy once again. With their endless budget from Disney, Pixar can create and explore any aspect necessary and writer/director Brad Bird does just that. The story here comprises elements of drama, sadness, family relations, job pressures, as well as a wonderful monologue near the end by a critic for critics. The story is pitch-perfect, always understandable and the foundation for which the film is made.And, since it is Pixar and Disney, the look and feel of the film is so engrossing, it looks better than other animated films made after it. One of the things Pixar does so well is find the middle ground in making elements of the frame look real but not too real, thus still maintaining an animated universe. They did it with the water in Finding Nemo, the cars in Cars, and they do it here with the food, which at times looks so real you want to taste it.I really can't say anything bad about Ratatouille. Even the story elements of how Remy and his human counterpart, Linguini, are able to work together work because this is the animated world which lends itself to more freedoms than our world. The voices are terrific from Patton Oswalt to Ian Holm to the great Peter O'Toole as deathly-thin food critic Anton Ego. There really isn't anything here that doesn't work and Michael Giacchino's score emits the spirit of Paris that sets the background for this story. This is just a great film, perfect in its story, its characters and the wonderful, vibrant world it creates. Years after its release, Ratatouille continues and will continue to impress and immerse viewers in a touching story with beautiful surroundings about the cutest rat in the world becoming a chef in Paris. Only animation, and only Pixar, could make this a film and succeed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Ratatouille Disappoints,"Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 1 and 2.And now, Ratatouille. Considering that this movie came from Pixar, it was so earth shatteringly average that it made me want to cry.Remy (Patton Oswalt, King of Queens) is a rat with a love for cooking. It's his passion in life. Often choosing cooking over family. His dad (Brian Dennehy) and the rest of the rat colony, all think Remy needs to stop chasing a dream that will never come true. It's time wasted.After messing around in a local woman's kitchen, Remy gets busted and chased out of the house with a shotgun. Everyone else, in fear, heads for their little boats to float away in the sewer. Remy gets separated from his family, certain that he'll never see his family again. Hungry and alone, all Remy has is the book, Anyone Can Cook, of his all time favorite chef, Gusteau.In his delusional state, Remy receives advice from a shoulder angel version of the recently deceased Chef Gusteau and ends out making all the way to Gusteau's old restaurant in Paris.Remy befriends Linguini. A young garbage boy who is credited with making a delicious soup that was actually Remy's. Because Remy would never get a chance to cook, he and Linguini enter into a partnership, where Remy does the cooking through Linguini, and Linguini gets the credit.As the movie wears on, the two run into several problems. They find it difficult to keep this secret from the overly mean head chef, Skinner, a growing tension between the two begins when Linguini falls in love with another chef, and they are faced with the challenge of cooking something for the most respected and hard to please critic in France...Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole)Critics have raved this movie as the best film Pixar has ever made. Uh...no. This is probably their worst film ever made. Pixar has always churned out great family movies, and I've always adored the characters they create. No...not this time.None of the characters are terribly likable, and the laughs are very few, despite repeated attempts with gags about French people.It was OK. Nothing more, nothing less. It's original, as most Pixar stuff is, and so that helps it along, but it just wasn't that good compared to their other work.

"Masterpiece doesn't describe Ratatouille, there has to be a better word.","Ratatouille, the new Disney/Pixar CGI animation film currently sweeping the cinema circuit around the globe. Pixar known for so many CGI animation classics manages to keep churning out winner after winner, and here with Ratatouille they manage to hit a home run, scratch that... a grand slam.The story is not only funny, but also touching in that it reminds to never forget about the people who helped you get where you are and that family whether related or not is important.The main premise is about a rat named Remy whom has the gift to cook. A connoisseur of fine food, Remy manges to help a bumbling garbage boy with no self confidence become the talk of Paris by using him as his personal mechanism to prepare Paris' finest cuisine. However Remy has a dilemma, now that he has risen to stardom, he also has his family who tries to bring him back to the colony because of their distrust for humans, and once Remy's human robot begins to let the fame and fortune go to his head, it becomes a matter of personal resentment he himself must overcome given he is the main cause of the problem, and also the source of the solution.Out to get Remy is the current head chef of the famous Gusteau's, Gusteau's once Paris' famed 5 star restaurant, has now become a 3 star tourist attraction because a snobbish food critic feels the food served is not even good enough for peasants. Once word of the fine food hits the papers the critic himself has to find out how Gusteau's made this triumphant comeback.Ratatouille has tons of laughs, excitement and mayhem. The jokes are truly and mainly adult oriented with a sprinkle of moral lesson mixed in for the kiddies. Although G-rated Ratatouille does go onto to be a bit racy at times, but really it is having fun poking fun at the French Culture without insulting the legacy.Director brad Bird, best known for his hit The Incredibles manages to bring the element of family and trust front and center while engaging the audience in one of the most entertaining animated films since The Lion King. Ratatouille shines as Pixars greatest achievement from beginning to end, and is worth double the admission price for the story alone.I challenge anyone to say this isn't Pixars finest film yet.9 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"truly devilish fun and mind-blowingly entertaining as classic cartoon style, but also very successful in storytelling- magnifique!","It's pretty easy to make little rodents charming and fun characters (just ask Disney himself, to a clichéd extent), but it's even harder to make them work in such a way that's original and exciting as comedy in conventional ways for today's audiences. But Brad Bird shouldn't be lumped into the group of today's CGI animators. He doesn't really think in those terms, but rather in how to make things look real, and yet at the same time keeping in full mind that it's a cartoon, not reality. This goes not simply for the rats themselves- the funniest, probably even funnier, that Disney's remotely had to market since the Great Mouse Detective- but the human characters too, who have their own distinct shapes and qualities based on personality and relevance to the story (whether they're good or bad, or maybe even more complex too). He places the designs for the characters right up there with the rest of the atmosphere, and then also adds in just the right way to make that wonderfully formulaic Pixar storyline- you know a lot of what may unfold, though not everything, and you know that you're in excellent hands because of the levels of detail and nuance in the comedy chaos at times. It'll be hard to beat this (to put it in a corny phrase) 'gourmet selection' as the best animated film of the year, and certainly the best that Pixar's done since, um, the last Brad Bird movie!The story is the fish out of water, or in this case rat, where a little rodent named Remy, who is totally immersed in the style of Augustus Gusteau, a famous French chef who dies, and who's position is filled by a lowly garbageman named Linguini. He can't cook, of course, but somehow Remy, separated from his rat family, cooks something up on the spot as a not-quite accident, sending Linguini as the one who supposedly made it. On the fluke, he becomes the new chef at Gusteau's...only, the chef's a rat, literally, hilariously pulling Linguini's hair to make him a cooking puppet (early on this makes for some of the best physical comedy of any Pixar movie). This fluke becomes the start of the usual ball of string unraveled bit by bit, involving an heir to Gusteau's fortune, a love interest in aggressive chef Colette, and Remy's reconnection and estrangement from his huge rat clan and his father. All the while Bird throws in such dangerous and downright devilish comedy for a *G* rated animated movie. And there's morales to be learned too, or sort of taken away, I guess, only this time in the true Disney form instead of Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket, it's Remy and the, well, illusion of Gusteau's ghost appearing to him as a quasi-conscious.What makes Ratatouille stand out of the pack from the fellow summer far of the moment, particularly 4th of July fare, is how there's such deft to Bird and his team navigating along the lines of making the comedy work to its excessive lengths while always keeping a firm grip on which turn the story will take next (the moments I didn't quite expect- the whole heir angle involving Linguini, and the climactic scenes with the rats preparing the restaurant's dinners, all washed before going to work, and keeping 'under wraps' the health inspector at the same time!). I probably laughed just as much during this film as I would at something much raunchier like Knocked Up or Grindhouse, to give recent examples, but as mentioned there's a riskiness to Bird's style here.One scene I particularly loved is when Remy is training linguini to command the muscle-controlled hair pulling scheme at his home, and there's a build-up to what seems like a knife going to cut into his fingers while he's chopping vegetables (up to this point he's been hopeless in his training), but at this very point where we should expect the worst, which is funny unto itself, it starts to level out and he's sort of under control. Sort of in that he'll still be naturally clumsy enough to spill the wine on his own head. Same goes for little things like the quite silhouetted bit Remy passes by with the lover about to shoot the other and then falling into full embrace, or the actual fellow employees at Gusteau's, one of who has the wildest thumb ever shown in a movie, least of all a 'family' movie, that I can remember (albeit Bird does come out of working on the Simpsons).So many masterstrokes of comedy go on that it's almost neglected to note how exciting a lot of the film is too, the run-around Remy has in the kitchen first time he comes in or the chase through Paris between the crooked head cook Skinner and Remy, and how seamless voice-work and the (now highly expected) advances in Pixar's technical innovations go together. It was a good guessing game who was the voice of Ego (it's O'Toole, but then it could be any given old regal British person), and to pick out that it's Ian Holm or Garofolo voicing some of the other parts, but it's not something that is immediately meant to be stand-out like in other CGI movies where it's being sold mostly on celebrity voice talent. It's almost like a lot of this comes quite naturally to Bird and his team, and yet because it isn't it reverts to becoming all the more remarkable. Ratatouille is simply an exceptionally fun picture, loaded with sight gags and puns and slips of behavior, and never overbearing with any of the usual messages that come pre-packaged for kids in these movies, all the more remarkable as it comes nearer to Pixar reusing previous ones.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The best yet!,"At this point, Brad Bird is no longer making great animated movies -- he's making great movies, end of sentence.From the standpoint of writing, this one keeps an astonishing number of themes going, creates great multifaceted characters, and maintains believable suspense and motivation, all without ever seeming strained or ""written."" From the standpoint of animation, it's unbelievable. The translucency of a rat's paw, the dented shine of a copper kettle, the complex texture of a crumb of bread, are all rendered with breathtaking accuracy. (And Paris has never looked lovelier -- if the French tourist board didn't subsidize this production, they should have.) From the standpoint of voice acting, it ranges from believable and unshowoffy (unlike the annoying star turns we're seeing in a lot of these days) to the stentorian sneer of the great Peter O'Toole.And, most of all, the character creation and animation is beyond belief. The facial expressions, the unique-to-each-character body movements, the sense of weight and texture are so incredibly closely observed and reproduced that at times I had to work to remember that what I was seeing was animation and not Oscar-caliber acting.If this one doesn't go up in the Best Picture category instead of simply Best Animated Feature, there's no justice in Oscar-land.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Adorable; More Chase Scenes than Development; All Male,"""Ratatouille"" is adorable. Remy, the lead character, a rat gourmet cook, is noble, sweet, and endearing.The animation is top notch: beautiful, detailed, appearing to be three dimensional. Paris was never lovelier.I laughed several times, and even cried once, when a character is served a meal that brings back memories of his childhood.There is one chase scene after another. The rat is menaced by much larger human beings; he escapes. This is repeated several times.Given all the chase scenes, there isn't much time left for character development. Linguini, a cook, announces he is in love; when did that happen? And Remy, though the main character, does not grow or change at all. He cooks; he escapes; he cooks; he escapes.All these chase scenes leave little room for the kind of magic, time out of time moments found in cartoon classics: the dance in the ballroom from ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the spaghetti dinner or ""midnight howl"" from ""Lady and the Tramp,"" the dance of the mushrooms from ""Fantasia.""The villain, Skinner, a short, dark-skinned, cook, is uninteresting. His major crime seems to be promoting fast food. ""Supersize Me"" did a much better job of skewering fast food. There are a lot of truly terrifying cartoon villains out there: Cruella de Ville, the witch queen in ""Snow White."" Skinner is not in their class.Skinner is a nice name for a villain, here. Skinner is, of course, the last name of B. F. Skinner, the behaviorist famous for experimenting on rats, and for his book title, ""Beyond Freedom and Dignity.""Brad Bird, who also wrote ""The Incredibles,"" favors excellence and individuality, themes that run counter to Skinner's theories. So, his bad guy is named ""Skinner,"" a very un-French name in a Parisian setting.""Ratatouille,"" like too many animated films, is a man's world. There is only one female character, and she is underdeveloped.I loved the beauty of this film's animation, but it isn't a classic, to me. There just aren't those moments where the action stops, and I get in touch with the heart and soul of a living, growing, character. And the all-male Paris -- both its rats and its humans are viritually all male -- is too grim in its obvious message.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Dinner is Served...Spectacularly,"Brad Bird's latest creation takes place in Paris, the city that is thought by many to be the city of the worlds greatest food. However, there are some problems. Mainly, that our hero, Remy (Patton Oswalt), is a rat. A rat that is a brilliant chef with a taste for fine food, but a rat none the less. Running from a mad old granny with a shotgun, being separated from his family, being flushed down one of the biggest pipes EVER! and being followed by the ghost of the late, great Gusteau, the chef that says ""Anyone can cook"", are just some of the problems the poor rat has to face.While this is a sweeping statement, a food critic named Anton Ego (voiced brilliantly by Peter O'Toole) takes it a bit too literally,making sure Gusteau's restaurant isn't as popular as it was. When Remy meets Linguini (Lou Romano), a terrible garbage boy/wannabe chef, he takes him under his wing (rat paw) and controls him through a strange method of pulling his hair??? The film has an excellent screenplay, amazing animations, brilliant art and mostly superb voices. The rats, normally horrible and dirty, are cute and clean. Brad Bird's screenplay is rich with jokes (Remy waves to a cyclist, who, disgusted, isn't looking where he's going and crashes into a car in a cloud of shopping and bike parts), passion (Linguini's love, Colette) and tiny details which would amaze even the greatest director (Remy's oven-glove bed, the rat poison/exterminator shop, Gusteau's ghost telling Remy what to do). It's all there, you've just got to look for it.There is only one bad thing about 'Ratatouille'. The character and voice of Languini, is in my opinion, not as fantastic as the rest of the film. Lou Romano doesn't quite seem to hit the right note, one brick short of a house or whatever you want to say. Linguini's character is too whiny, even for someone in his position. If he whines about the cooking, and at some points Remy, ditch the rat and go get a different job. He just doesn't seem to have his heart in it to me.Peter O'Toole, Ian Holm, Patton Oswalt and all the others, however, make it a very grand dish indeed. Patton Oswalt relies mainly on ear twitching and eyebrow raising, but when he does talk, you listen. Ian Holm, the small, evil chef who need a stool to taste soup, is, as ever, brilliant and Peter O'Toole seems to relish being the bad guy, just as Anton Ego loves to criticise the lack of relish (forgive the pun, had to be done...and the rhyme!). Dark, mysterious and even scary, Peter O'Toole brings an edge to another great Pixar villain.All in all, the film is a masterpiece, definitely Pixar's and Brad Bird's best dish yet, but hopefully there is more to come. Consider it a starter, an ""amuse de bouche"", and just wait for Pixar's next dish, whatever it is, and hope it's just as delicious . In the words of Anton Ego, ""Surprise me!"". Parents, just hope your kid's don't want a rat",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Rat Movie Halfway Decent; Not Better,"Rating this movie #44 in the all time best movie list is just plain silly; and adds to the suspicion that the integrity of the IMDb website is compromised by studio meddling (which IMDb can't prevent.) This picture was much better than CARS, but it's a high-mediocre film at best. Most of the characterizations, humor, etc offer nothing very original or new. We enjoyed this picture -- make no mistake -- but while Pixar offers the best of current day animation the overall quality of storytelling doesn't hold a candle to the work of Walt Disney.Hollywood stacks the deck in bragging about recent hits. It makes no sense to compare the box office of an era when adult tickets are $11; children $7.50 to such classics as SNOW WHITE which sold millions of tickets at 50 cents for adults and 25 cents for children. SNOW WHITE lasted 68 years so far, and isn't dead yet. Pixar's rat flick won't even be a memory by 2010.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Ratatouille must get a Best Picture nomination (in a fair world),"Brad Bird really moved me when I saw The Iron Giant, a film I didn't want to see at the time. That little animated feature is simply beautiful and touching. Ratatouille takes that level of emotion to another point. Way higher. Don't think kids won't get it. They're not stupid. I remember going to the movies with my parents (they took me to Abel Gance's Napoleon) and being fascinated by the whole thing, even if I didn't understand the whole idea. This is not a comedy. There are some laughs and everything, but it's something more intelligent and dramatic. It's an astounding and complex film about longing for a different life and trying your own talents. About not to be content with the way things are and to go and challenge everything. Even if you end up empty-handed. Gorgeous animation, great script, wonderful characters. This is how things must be done.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Visually top-notch, storyline weak","I am a Pixar fan. No doubt. They are second to none, doing what they do. The imagery of Rataouille is simply stunning, the people at Pixar have done it again: They've surpassed themselves. All surfaces so beautifully textured adding a strong sense of realism to the surreal universe that's computer animated movies. And the movements of the characters are so very alive, and it all looks so easy. But anybody with even the smallest interest in animation will tell you, it is not.The storyline, however, is IMHO definitely one of Pixar's weakest. It's not completely without merit, though. Where most of the characters left me somewhat indifferent, the food critic Anton Ego, for instance, was subject to a most compelling portrayal. Sadly, he was only a minor character. The biggest problem with the story of Ratatouille was, for me, however, not in the characters, but in the mere fact, that I didn't laugh. Now, compared with earlier Pixar movies like Toy Story, Monsters Inc. and my all-time favorite The Incredibles, that all had me laughing loud & heartily from start to finish, this seemed to lack the trade-mark Pixar humor.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Don't get too excited...,"This is certainly a technically excellent and visually rich film. However, that's not a good enough reason to rate this film so high. 10/10? 9/10? It's a good film, I agree, but it's certainly not one the all-time greats.It's a film about a rat who is a top chef because he learnt how to cook by reading a book. It's therefore a film for children. Unfortunately, my children, and many others sitting around us in a packed cinema last weekend, were restless by the mid-point. Despite it's great visuals, Ratatouille is just a bit boring. It lacks the excitement and humour of The Incredibles, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, and Toy Story (1 & 2). Given this children's film struggles to maintain the attention of children (a recurring theme in many reviews on this site), it's got to be rated down.As an adult, meanwhile, I was left cold by the unsubtle moralising, the ludicrous mix of accents, and the fact the restaurant, outside the kitchen, looked nothing at all like a top Paris restaurant.Sorry. Disappointed.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
top notch: A MUST SEE!!!!,"I can't believe it, but it has happened...Brad Bird has finally surpassed John Lasseter. This is by far the best of Pixar's films. After a slight let down in 2006 with a story about race cars,(although beautifully animated (as always)) - a poor subject matter choice for a good story, Pixar are back on track with this stunning animation. I didn't think the captivating storytelling that was Toy Story could be topped; but it has been done with this, the chef-d'oeuvre from Brad Bird.The initial concept alone of a rat wanting to work in a restaurant as a cook is pure gold, and it only gets better. The Parisian world's artistic detail, subtle references, expert animation, charming characters, and wonderful story make this a definite must see for everyone.Praise the almighty Pixar!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Best movie of the summer!,"I agree with the other reviewers here who said Ratatouille is by far Pixar's best to date: I adore this movie. It is brilliant, and it does indeed transcend age brackets. I'm a huge Pixar fan as things stand, and Ratatouille only confirmed this. I do hope they keep this up; the Pixar crew has raised the bar once again, setting higher and higher standards for themselves as they go along! What an admirable enterprise this is, when so many other movie makers repeat themselves in tired ways ... Ratatouille rocks! Do not miss this movie on any account. I don't normally rave about movies and have never written a review here either ... I regard it as my business to create excellent scripts, that does not actually mean I'm a huge movie goer.

"An unexpected surprise of a film, with a great message.","I really loved Ratatouille, it was original, sweet and lots of fun. While not as laugh-out-loud funny as the two Toy Story films, it is definitely one of the better Pixars, and a complete delight from start to finish. Honestly, the whole family will find it just as delightful as I did, and the film has a great message ""a great cook can come from anywhere"", summed up perfectly by Anton Ego. The story was highly original, if a little slow at the beginning, and deliciously engaging up to the last minute, and the animation was just spellbinding. The script, while not as irreverent as Toy Story, was very entertaining and touching, and I loved the characters- everyone was likable and unique, but what made Remy stand out for me was because he was so adorable, and his voice actor did a delightful job voicing him. The voice cast were very talented, and all did a superb job, especially Peter O'Toole in a marvellous turn as the ""nasty"" food critic Anton Ego. All in all, a brilliant film, that fully succeeded in what it promised to do, to make us want to cook. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Good rather than great,"I suppose any Pixar film has the unenviable task of living up to the previous movies from the production company. The Toy Story movies are the gold standard and equally fantastic for both children and adults.Ratatouille follows the adventures of a rat who befriends a cleaner at a restaurant which has seen happier times. The rat is a frustrated cook and it gets the chance to prove its skill via the cleaner. The film is a little long and drags a bit at times - That's the adult perspective and I suspect some children would also be restless at times. As ever with Pixar some of the visual are stunning especially the cityscapes of Paris. Not in the same league as Toy Story, but still fairly entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Underwhelming,"Ratatouille fails to deliver the Pixar experience that we so know and love. The animation is perfect, which is now expected, but the narrative lacks wit, passion and drive and left an expectant reviewer underwhelmed.Many of the characters in Ratatouille are peripheral to the plot and here lies the problem. The story is rather linear it does not twist or turn, it is happy to focus on Remy's escapades. The characters that do have a firmer foothold within the story are not entertaining or fun... There is no endearment.By far the best character has to be Anton Ego voiced wonderfully by Peter O'Toole - an egotistical, self-assured food critic... And that is what is missing from Ratatouille the quirkiness of character so evident in previous Pixar animations.Ratatouille is an improvement on the just sufferable Cars but apart from the last fifteen-minutes of the film and some funny moments, which there were not nearly enough, it was a rather sombre and just about satisfactory affair.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Why So Popular?,"Please understand that I write as someone who thoroughly enjoyed prior Pixar efforts: Toy Story, Wall-E, Finding Nemo, etc. However, as That_American_Chick wrote recently, the animation is the only exceptional quality of ""Ratatouille."" There's nothing particularly wrong with the movie; it's just lacking in anything particularly good. The story line and the attempts at humor are, by and large, very predictable. Considering some movie critics put ""Ratatouille"" in their Top Ten lists for 2007, I expected something more. Granted, you could do worse; there's nothing off-putting here, but when the movie ended, my wife and I looked at each other and said, ""That's it? What's the big deal?""",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Nutshell Review: Ratatouille,"The Pixar juggernaut continues! I've always been enthralled by the movies that Pixar puts out ever since Toy Story, and through the years, Pixar has built a brand of trust amongst movie goers, with quality storytelling using animation as a tool to tell them, not because it's cool to do things through the medium, but that it adds a certain powerful, believable dimension, with stories rooted to universal themes, yet jazzed up by the structure in which it's told. The Incredibles ranked amongst my favourite so far, but writer-director Brad Bird has topped that with Ratatouille, a story about a rat, and probably the most mature of the Pixar stories to date.One of the rare successful rats in the animated genre is Mickey, but Remy here (voiced by Patton Oswalt) has more character, and with that photo realistic quality to him, will give Mickey a run for his money. It's a class act story about a rat who dreams of being somebody, of wanting to follow that dream in becoming a chef in Paris, and is undeterred by his size, and well, form, even though in any kitchen, the last thing you want is a rat in it. And to realize his dream, he forms a symbiotic friendship with bumbling Linguini (Lou Romano), a garbage boy who just joined the restaurant which Remy's idol, the late renowned chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett), founded.It's a story about the tussle between friendship and family, with the latter providing an added emphasis, and you'll happen to just about find a familiar chord to it. Remember the time when your folks frown upon the friends you keep, and how sometimes, through their good intentions, unwittingly stifle your hopes and desires? Or how family becomes that obstructing stone on the pathway to success, or being taken for granted to provide for greedy, unabashed family and so-called friends? Ratatouille explores these and more, though they're kept veiled and subtle for the narrative to move on, and never provided a dull moment for kids and adults alike.Pixar's animation continues to astound, and provide inspiration to the many 3D animators out there - they have always set new benchmarks for others to follow, and I think they're on top of their game with the excellent animated portrayal of Paris, the kitchen, and of course, the rats, with that touch of photo realistic quality to it all, which does wonders to the food presented. Amongst the food, I like the crusty breads best - you can almost feel the texture, and the rustling sound is just to die for. And the cheese, you can just feel it melt in your mouth. Mmm mmm!The story's adversaries might be familiar - a mean boss Skinner (Ian Holm) and a mightier- than-though food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), but it's the latter, despite his shorter screen time, that does its best to chill, and it was such an obvious jab with making him English. The comedy's here top notch, not necessarily relying solely on slapstick to bring on the laughs, but possessing many sly moments throughout as you root for little Remy and his escapades, less so for Linguini though, who comes off as that perfect loser in life.Ratatouille is a perfectly delicious offering worthy of that Pixar stamp, and definitely gonna be a crowd pleaser. I'm not sure why the delay in getting it released here, and having to suffer watching poor quality animation along the way. But the wait is well worth it, and I bet everyone will be pleasantly surprised indeed, with all the ingredients coming together for that wonderful presentation, that tastes and looks ju st wonderful. Despite the overkill of trailers, pre-screening warnings to turn off your mobile phones, etc, continue to put your trust in that little rat Remy, and savour what Ratatouille has to offer. No regrets - highly recommended, and another contender for my top movie of the year listing.Ratatouille is preceded by the trailer for the next Pixar movie Wall-E, and a short Pixar featurette titled Lifted, about two aliens and one of their attempts in passing the Alien Abduction course. Stay throughout the animated end credits for a little coda at the end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Decent Pixar,"A rat who can cook makes an unusual alliance with a young kitchen worker at a famous restaurant.This film is given high praise, and many seem to think it is among Pixar's best work. That seems a tad overblown. While the film is certainly good, it does not seem to go above and beyond anything else the studio has done. The animation (again, good) is no better than anything else they have released.Even the message is the same old story: someone (or thing) from one group wants to be in another. His current group says no, the new one is hesitant, but he has to be himself. Now, that is a good message, and this may be an extreme example (rats in a kitchen a la ""Muppets Take Manhattan"") but it is still nothing new.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

take the last scene from mouse hunt + animate it + set it in Paris = ratatouille,"Nothing special.....I walked into the theater to see Ratatouille for two reasons.(1)to finally see a good pixar flick (2)well, there was this strange urge in my body, perhaps a sound, that kept yelling ""go see it, go see it""And believe me, the feeling I had after watching the movie was somehow the opposite of the feeling I had before watching it.I walked in feeling anxious and overwhelmed .....yet a bit skeptic (I always have my doubts about Disney movies.)......And I walked out with a feeling that ringed ""that's it.""

"Visually stunning, but story was a flat soufflé...","My wife and I, huge Pixar fans both, came into this movie with high expectations given what critics had said about it.Visually, the critics were spot-on. Much of the movie feels as if it is not animated at all. Within 10 years of so, Pixar will have us believing they work work with live actors, I'm sure.But technical proficiency does not a masterpiece make; there must be a good story to tell. And this movie teeters on the brink of not having that story.Assuming ""Ratatouille"" was made with children in mind, most children below age 10, maybe even age 12, won't get this movie. They'll love the cute rats and cheer for the heroes, but will miss the nuances of the story.What hurts this movie's accessibility is a soup with many ingredients: Thick accents, an uninteresting secondary hero (Linguini), a villain (Skinner) who is not adequately developed and back-storied, and a plot scenario that never seems to be able to create a sense of urgency. I can easily imagine a lot of youngsters wondering what exactly the big deal is.It doesn't help matters that the role of Linguini is fitfully written and voiced by an actor without much experience; Lou Romano was just a bad pick. Ian Holm's turn as Skinner could have been done much better.Janeane Garofolo's Colette isn't properly back-storied, either; it's amazing that this movie can run for nearly two hours yet still leave so much on the table in regards to its characters.There is some good, however. Patton Oswalt is great in the title role, and Peter O'Toole's exceptional turn as Anton Ego left me wishing he'd had a bigger role. Brad Garrett's Gusteau also gets too little screen time.In summary, this movie doesn't rise to the level of greatness found in some of Pixar's best films (""Toy Story 2,"" ""The Incredibles,"" ""Cars""), but it isn't a total bust, either. The word ""charming"" has been used to describe it before and I guess it fits.

Out the window . . .,"Food, family, creativity, criticism, racism, romance: If these themes satisfy your critical standards for a superior film, then Ratatouille should qualify as one of your favorite films of the year.Pixar and director Brad Bird, who defined family entertainment with The Incredibles, have another human comedy animation hit on their hands, and the foodies have to love it. Remy (voice of Patton Oswalt), a rat in a French restaurant, helps a hapless lad named Linguini become the five-star restaurant's star chef.The rat is a rodent realistically realized, homely by contrast with those more pleasant looking in Flushed Away. The human faces of the non-rats are by far the best renditions of reality I have seen in hyper-humanized computer graphics. The restaurant kitchen is so real I wanted to cut onions and crush garlic. But the piece de resistance is Anton Ego, the food critic, as trenchant a criticism of us self-centered, aloof critics as will ever appear on screen.The voice of Peter O'Toole makes his demeanor even more insipid and scary, his words heavy with moralizing: ""In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new."" I was humbled and exalted at the same time. Art for art's sake, I say.Bertolt Brecht said, ""Food first, then morality."" Well, throw out the moralizing platitudes and eat.

In fact, I think this is colour-by-numbers much of the time. A formulaic, not very imaginative film that looks feeble beside, for example, Antz and the Shrek movies. I don't begrudge the time I spent with it, but given the resources and the background, it could have been much, much better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Great Film For Anyone and Everyone,"Generally, Pixar has shied away from the realm of humanity in previous films, but Ratatouille finally marks their entry into human relationships and instead of focusing on the fantasy world of little critters, they provide a remarkably balanced picture of both (completely lovable) character ensembles. This is the essence of movie-making, people. The comedy hearkens back to ye olde days; this movie could have worked just as well as a silent film. Camera angles (if you'd like to call them that) are top-notch and provide an invigoration to the action that never gets old. The acting and writing are very smart; this isn't just a kiddy film. There are strong plot ties to egoism, relationships, and a rather Burton-esquire approach to critical cynicism, not to mention references to religion (*gasp*), alcohol (*gasp*), and illegitimate children (*gasp*) which are unfairly taboo in today's family films. My true thanks go out Pixar for making what is perhaps the best animated film in a very long time, one that can easily contend with Disney classics, and my new personal favorite animated feature.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Bon Appetit,"The city of Paris has never looked better - more richly-hued and elegant - than it does in ""Ratatouille,"" the latest product from Pixar Entertainment and the umpteenth animated film featuring an anthropomorphic animal as its lead character.Brad Bird's confection brings two unlikely elements - food and rodents - together in its clever story of a rat with a passion for gourmet cooking who teams up with a newly hired ""garbage boy"" to surreptitiously whip up a whole host of savory dishes at an upscale restaurant located on the West Bank of Paris.""Ratatouille"" is somewhat more cerebral and considerably less frenetic than the typical Pixar production, which may prove problematic for some of the younger folk in the audience. And, indeed, there are times when the pacing does tend to drag a bit even for more seasoned moviegoers like myself. Still, the action scenes are palpitating in their energy and excitement, and even those jaded by the unimaginable strides made in CGI technology over the years will be properly bowled over by what the filmmakers have managed to pull off here. The sheer fluidity of movement alone in this film is draw-dropping in its impressiveness. The story is rather less compelling overall, but one has to admire Bird's willingness to keep the drama at least somewhat intimate and life-sized. The price of that subtlety, however, is that the movie is also a trifle dull in spots.The film is highly blessed with energetic voice work by the likes of Patton Oswalt, Ian Holm, Lou Romano, Brad Garrett, Peter O'Toole, and, above all, Janeane Garofalo as a high-strung, up-and-coming chef who doesn't take too kindly to fresh-out-of-the-oven competitors encroaching on her territory.But it is the exquisitely designed backdrops that finally make ""Ratatouille"" a thing of joy and beauty.

One of the Summer's Best,"When I first heard about Pixar's Ratatouille, I thought it sounded incredibly lame, and that it would signal the beginning of Pixar's demise. Not only was I wrong, but in a big way. Ratatouille was not only one of the most entertaining movies I have seen this year, but it might possibly be the best film Pixar has ever made, and that is saying quite a lot given their previous offerings.For those of you who haven't heard of it, Ratatouille is the story of a rat named Remy who has a penchant for cooking. This poses a problem for Remy because if a rat is seen anywhere near a kitchen it is attacked and killed. However, through a chance encounter, Remy teams up with an incompetent human chef to become the greatest chef in Paris.While the story might seem juvenile, director Brad Bird (The Incredibles) exceptionally creates a story which all audiences can enjoy. On one hand it is the tale of an outcast, who despite tremendous adversity is able to achieve great success. At the same time, it is a coming of age story; where the son must leave his family behind to do something truly great.This story never fails to entertain the audience, not only with its laughs, but also with its characters. These characters are voiced superbly by performers which were perfectly for their roles. Bird didn't pick his actors to have names to put on a poster (as Pixar has done before with Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, John Goodman, and Billy Crystal) but the actors were specifically selected for the characters they played.Standing out amongst these actors was Peter O'Toole who played the evil food critic Anton Ego. O'Toole delivers the finest lines of the film, as well as the climactic monologue in which his character critiques the food of Remy. This monologue may stand as one of the best ever, and it was spoken to perfection by Mr. O'Toole.Not only does the film have a wonderful story, but its animation is as delectable as the food that Remy creates. The world which Remy lives in was complete to the slightest detail, making earlier Pixar films such as Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. look amateur. Every scene in the film was visually stunning, a fact which made the film considerably more entertaining.Overall, I give Ratatouille 10/10 salty stix. In a summer that has been oversaturated with disappointing sequels to some of my favorite movies, Pixar has again created one of the most original, enjoyable films of the year, and I recommend it to everybody.Google SaltyStix for more film reviews",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Rat Film 5 Star,"Leonard Maltin in his glowing review of this Ratatat film calls Pixar, ""a class by themselveswho have carved a niche for itself like no other."" I agree completely. Every one of Pixar's films have an amazing quality which haven't been broken so far as yet. On top of being an animation studio at the pinnacle of greatness, Pixar also has to offer the best time at the theater with their shorts always preceding their films. Thus they offer a full night at the movie theater not seen since the classic days of cinema.Ratatouille did practically the impossible for me. It matched and even exceeded most of my expectations. It had humor, a great story line, and moral message about being all that you can be and not being afraid to succeed or tell the truth. On top of that, it had some of Pixar's best animation to date. The views of Paris are exquisitely detailed and the details of the kitchen fantastic. But even more so the characters most especially the rats have a great look and feel to them that make them lovable even though they are well rats.The story revolves around Remy, a rat with a keen sense of smell and taste who can't stand his life as rat which in his mind is equivocal with a thief. Remy draws strength from ads he sees of a famous cook named Gusteau. Although Gusteau is dead, he draws strength from him and even has an invisible friend in this Gusteau in his own mind. Gusteau then becomes basically a way for the audience to see the inner workings of the mind of Remy. Things really take off for Remy when he is separated from his family of rats and runs into the garbage boy of Gusteau's who can't cook, but is willing to work with the talented Remy to gain a name in Gusteau's restaurant. Neither have it easy as Linguini, the garbage boy, is looked down upon by the scheming master cook of Gusteau's, but a good villain is always needed even if he isn't a completely bad fellow. Another antagonist for our heroes is Anton Ego, a critic of the highest quality who sunk Gusteau establishment in the first place leading to Gusteau's early death. Ego isn't a true villain and has interesting depth, but what else can be expected of a character voiced by aging legend Peter O'Toole.Ratatouille is another gem from the Pixar studio and not likely to unsaddled as the best animation the year. In fact this is among Pixar's best ventures yet.Note: Fantastic exotic score by Michael Giacchino which evokes that Paris style.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Ratatouille - My Favorite Movie of the Year So Far!,"I found it thoroughly engaging with a bit of everything for everyone. The story of a rat aspiring to be a chef may not sound appealing at first, but the movie took me to places that I did not expect. I could identify with the need for family and relationships with the desire to pursue your dreams. It is unique in this summer of sequels - of couse, the movie has the trademark Pixar brand of unbelievable visuals and attention to detail..in this case, I paid particular attention to the restaurant's kitchen and its coterie of characters. The food depicted here looks so real I could touch the onions cooking in the oven at one point.If you have a kid who's looking for thrills and slapstick humor, check. If you're older and looking for something sophisticated, artistic yet funny, with oh so many moments of cinematic pleasure, check. If you love Paris, see it! If you're a FOODIE, make reservations at a fine restaurant for dinner...this movie leaves you hungry for more! Finally, Ratatouille has HEART, and I will go back to see it again and again.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
not up to the usual,"I was really disappointed in the film, it didn't have much of a story line, and the characters weren't as filled out as usual. I can't tell if it was the writing, or the voice performances, but I really didn't much care for it.There wasn't the strong motivation of Nemo, for instance, where they HAD to find Nemo. Remy simply wanted to be a great cook, but there was no real driving force behind this want. The relationship between him and what's his name, the young chef (see I can't even remember his name) was so ho hum, not vital enough to drive the picture. And there were way too many animated humans, unlike Nemo and Pixar's previous efforts. I am probably in the minority, but animated human characters just don't get it for me. Animated animals, cars, chairs, fine, humans, no.Actor wise, I think Peter O'Toole was the most successful in his characterization, and the film could have used some more voice talent of his level. The voice of Remy didn't capture any excitement, energy, nothing vital or arresting. Like wise Brad Garret as the Ghost Chef. I loved him on Raymond, but he didn't really find a character here, however he wasn't alone.Maybe my expectations were too high, but Pixar has never let me down and I expected this to be right up there with their others.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A great animated fable packed with enthusiasm and absolutely amazing animation,"After last year's horrendously average and overrated Cars, I was unsure how to approach Ratatouille. It looked impressive, and it looked like another great entry into the Pixar/Disney lineup. But then, so too did Cars. But something about Ratatouille struck me as immediate, as something that needed to be seen now and not simmered over later. And thankfully, albeit with a few minor flaws, the film comes out as being just as excellent as I could have hoped.Ratatouille tells the story of Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt), a rat who has a keen sense of smell. So keen, that he outright refuses to eat just about anything that his rat colony/family finds in the dumpsters or just laying around. He is put to good use as the poison checker for the colony, but still chooses to search out good food, and not just anything. He dreams of being a famous chef, but is hindered by the fact that he is a rat.What follows is a bitter sweet story of just finding the place to belong. I will forego the mention of the various subplots and surprises, but I will incur that Remy does meet up with the lousy cook Linguini (Lou Ramano), and the two become partners in cooking at the famous Gusteau's Restaurant (as just about anyone who knows anything about the movie can tell you).Even with its bizarre storyline, and even more bizarre main character, Ratatouille is a treat from start to finish. Never once did I not feel like I was watching something from anyone other than a master storyteller, and even at its most fantastical moments, Ratatouille warms with animated joy at just the thought of continuing the storyline. Unlike many other animated films that go around in circles over its simplistic plot and overused morality tale, Ratatouille takes its moral tale, and wraps it around all sorts of plot elements. Children will love it for how comical and cutesy it is, but the adults will love it just for how layered and dense the story is.What it also packs is a wallop of enthusiasm totally devoid from almost the entirety of Cars. While the former moved along slower than animated movie I have ever seen, and was dull right to its very core, Ratatouille is exactly the opposite. It runs at just the right pace throughout the film, and each and every actor delivers their lines with finesse and conviction. They are devoted to these roles wholeheartedly, and are putting some actual effort into their lines. It may help that the majority of these actors are not big time Hollywood superstars, but what also may help is the fact that they all seem to have an interest in these characters and this story, and are not just in it for the paycheque at the end of the voice sessions. They are all clearly having fun with it. Even Peter O'Toole, who plays the menacingly wicked food critic Anton Ego, seems to be amused by his role.In fact, all of the voice actors do great with their roles. Oswalt gives a great balance of naivety, desire and pathos to his main character. I know there was some trouble trying to market the idea of a rat trying to make it in the human world, but I think Oswalt's voice skills helped greatly flatten this idea out into something great. Ramano also does great as Linguini, giving just the right amount of struggle in his voice to truly make his neurotic character truly interesting. Supporting turns from O'Toole, Brad Garrett, Janeane Garofolo, James Remar, and in particular, Ian Holm, are all very well done, and help make the film truly wonderful. Their French accents are all quite amusing. I also liked the small addition of John Ratzenberger, always a great voice to hear in a Pixar movie.The only thing that harms the film is that it runs too long. Director/Screenwriter Brad Bird had this same issue with his other excellent Pixar film (and Oscar winner), The Incredibles. Both pack in so much, and as a result, drag in places that should be more fairly fast paced. Here, these dragging scenes take place near the beginning (Remy does not meet up with Linguini until at least a half hour into the film), and part-way through the middle. All the elements are there, they just do not all add up into something blazingly fast paced. I can appreciate all of the little things Bird is doing to make the film appeal to more than just the children in the audience, but he almost lost me a few times doing it. A little bit of extra trimming could have helped avoid this problem.The animation on the other hand, is brilliant. There is no other word to describe it. Just the one scene where Remy realizes that he is in Paris, and overlooks the entire Parisian skyline, is enough reason to see the film. It looks fantastic in every scene, and never does the beautifully rendered scenery or characters look any less amazing than they did in the scene before. Pixar has really fine-tuned their style over the years, and it shows in how astonishing these characters look, even down to the minuscule little details like a few stubbly hairs on Linguini's chin. It just looks that realistic.On the whole, Ratatouille is not a perfect film, but it is still far greater than the likes of Cars or even this year's Shrek the Third. It was clearly put together so lovingly, and created with so much care that it cannot be seen as anything less than great. The animation, the story and the voice acting all come together to create what is probably going to be one of the best animated films of this or any year.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Much more complete than the average movie, Ratatouille is a 7-course meal providing nothing but the best in animation and storytelling","The only way this movie could not be enjoyed is if you watch it on an empty stomach. The folks of Pixar deliver what just might be the most complete animated film since Toy Story 2. By complete, we are talking the full course, not just story and humor. With flawless animation, a brilliant score, the best voice talent in ages, an excellent script, a nice story, plenty of humor, a dosage of romance, and a rather surprising amount of realism, and a heartwarming ending, Ratatouille is the best Cinderella story from Disney sinceCinderella. From the director of The Incredibles and from a studio that has delivered hit after hit after hit, it is no wonder why Disney spent so much money purchasing them. This was a tough-to-sell concept executed beautifully, poetically, and just might become the best film of the entire year. The only problem is that this movie sets the bar even higher for animated films from here on out.Ratatouille follows Remy (Patton Oswalt), a rat who wants to become a good cook instead of a good food thief (like his father and co.) and will attempt to do so with his special smelling abilities. After a mishap where he lives, he winds up underneath Paris, close to the restaurant of his mentor, the recently deceased Gusteau (Brad Garrett). Using the garbage boy of the ex-5-star restaurant Linguini (Lou Romano), he attempts to spread his talent of cooking. Conflicts arise when the head chef Skinner (Ian Holm) suspects the sudden rise of fame in Linguini's cooking and realizes his true worth. More conflicts arise when the only female chef becomes romantically involved with Linguini; Remy is having trouble returning to the lifestyle of a rat, and a well-known yet stern critic Ego (Peter O'Toole) decides to make a return into the spotlight.What makes Ratatouille stand tall with some of Pixar and even Disney's best works is the heavily detailed animation, that results in some of the most breathtaking chases and scenes and also results in plenty of concealed visual humor (Check out the structure of Ego's office). From the hairs of the rats to the water flowing to the food that looks good enough to eat, this is Pixar outperforming itself in terms of computer animation. Then we have the best casting since Finding Nemo. Once again focusing more on talent rather than star power, we have an excellent cast of actors and actresses providing the voices. The standout performances come from Peter O'Toole (almost Oscar-worthy), Brad Garrett, Lou Romano, Ian Holm, and Janeane Garofalo.The problem with animated films nowadays is their inability to present a story without having to aim low for a joke or referencing the pop culture of the times. Ratatouille is a living, breathing storybook come to life, and this is thanks to the excellent writing of Brad Bird. Bird combines plenty of conflicts with humor, and also a dosage of realism in terms of the way things are run behind the scenes of a restaurant. Unlike previous summer flicks, Bird perfectly handles the multiple villains in the Cinderella story, which nowadays is a complete rarity (Yes, there is more than one ""villain"" in the tale). Clocking in at just less than two hours, it might be a bit long for tykes but after the rather slow beginning, the movie almost instantly picks up once the setting changes. While the humor isn't as sprinkled as in Nemo or Toy Story, it provides plenty of laughs as well as action, drama, and even a little hint of romance. Linguini as a Pinocchio-like chef provide some of the funniest scenes in the whole movie.There just aren't enough words to describe just what makes this movie work, it is presented and handled with such delicacy, it keeps Pixar at the top of the animation kingdom, much to the disdain of Dreamworks, the other competitors, and even the animators at Disney. To craft a movie this good requires time, patience, attention to detail, and a desire to push the limits of animation and storytelling. There is no harder-working company in the movie industry than Pixar, and it shows with each and every single movie it has come out with since 1995; including some of the best films of all-time like Toy Story, Toy Story 2, and Finding Nemo. If the competitors aren't taking notes right now, it is because they don't desire to be the best.Bottom Line: You can only raise the bar higher so many times before not even yourself can reach it. This is what happened with Cars and Monster's Inc., and movies like Ratatouille are the reasons why. While the pacing and running time may be a turnoff for some, the excellent visuals and flawless storytelling more than make up for it. Like a full course meal, Ratatouille has a little bit of everything and much more. The Disney magic that was present back when Disney was alive is in full blast here, which is something that non-Pixar Disney movies lately have not been able to provide. Stop reading this and go enjoy the movie. Ratatouille just made Cars look a bit inferior as it becomes the best animated movie in years, and is potentially the best movie of the entire year. In a summer of sequels, a charming story about a rat with a crazy dream rises to the top of the quality heap.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Not enough jokes.,"The premise is good and it taken to fruition quite well. The characters are all distinct and memorable and the plot makes sense.Unlike ""The Incredibles"" which was visually stunning but had very few good jokes in Ratatouille when the jokes appear they are very good and some of the visual gags are excellent.The romantic angle was always going to be predictable and clichéd to an adult watching this film and, unfortunately, there aren't enough jokes to compensate for this.The ending is a bit sappy which is to be expected in a children's film but the sappiness goes on too long, there is a big piece at the end which is maudlin and boring and a joke free zone.Although the visuals are great and the jokes are really funny there simply aren't enough jokes to make this a good film for an adult.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Absolutely adorable! Mindblowingly impressive! You will fall in love with this movie!,"Absolutely adorable! Ratatouille deserves all the praise, ever! Pixar just continues to raise the bar and go beyond our expectations with this heartwarming yet incredibly funny gem of a flick.The level of detail and the rich texture of each scene is mindblowingly impressive. The voice characterizations especially by Patton Oswalt, Brad Garrett and Janeane Garofalo are well-directed accompaniments to the surprisingly earnest story that is sure to appeal to adult audiences as well. The animation and cinematography is amazingly sensitive, not showy at all but instead well motivated, effectively giving the audience a feel of what it's like to be Ratatouille's star, Chef Remy, who just so happens to be a rat.It is difficult not to be smitten by the range of complex emotions and situations as he is torn between his family and his passion for creating culinary masterpieces in a human world where he is despised in by default.Just like the movie's fiercest critic, The Grim Eater, it will be close to impossible not to fall in love with this movie. His character provides a pleasantly unexpected but fitting ending with his final review, and what he says is sure to resonate with critics everywhere. It sure hit the food and film critic in me! After all, it is a unique task, to be passing judgment, and Ratatouille is a creative offering worth going back to again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Mmm, perfecto!","Another masterpiece from Disney and Pixar, this year they bring us another family classic for generations to come, Ratatouille. My friend and I saw Ratatouille tonite and we just had a blast watching it, this film was such a pleasure and was so funny and cute. I would say that actually this is Pixar's best work, they have come such a long way from Toy Story, it's incredible. But Ratatouille had amazing animation that was so real, makes you wonder if we'll ever need actors in the future, lol. The story is just so charming and a perfect fit for any family to watch, even just to watch this film on your own, I guarantee you will have fun watching it.Remy is a rat with a special gift, a gift of smell, he uses this gift to cook. He's not just any ordinary cook, but an amazing one at that, but when he gets separated from his family, he is haunted by the most famous chef in the world, he ends up in Paris. Where he finds a restaurant that was once grand and has slipped up when it comes to good food. An ordinary garbage boy messes with a stew in the kitchen, when Remy sees this, he helps him out. Linguini, the garbage boy, accepts Remy and together they create masterpieces and bring the restaurant back up. They must keep it a secret how they create these fantastic foods; but that gets so much harder when people try to find out how he's so talented.Ratatouille is such a charming Disney/Pixar film, the animation is great, and the story is just terrific. The actors voices were so great and fit the characters well. If you are looking for a film to see this summer, Ratatouille is definitely a recommendation, it's good to know that Pixar is going to keep giving us these great animation films that I know will be considered classics for a very long time. Ratatouille is delicious, I loved this film.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Just when I thought the Golden Age of Pixar Was Finished.,"After the disappointment that was Cars, I thought that Pixar's creative magic had finally depleted. It's not that Cars was a bad film, it was good, but it wasn't up to par compared to the other Pixar classics. Now with Ratatouille I have to say that the magic of Pixar is alive and well.The film plotwise is just terrific. The story is well done and the characters are all hilarious. The humor is smart, funny, and original. The humor is one of the reasons that sets Pixar apart from Dreamworks and it's competitors There are no fart jokes in Ratatouille, and some of the best jokes reside in the dialogue. I would give an example, but I wouldn't want to ruin one of the brilliant scenes in the film. The characters are all interesting and lovable.Technically Ratatouille is amazing. While the characters are cartoonish the actual backgrounds are nearly photorealistic. This is truly a film to see on the big screen because the film has outstanding particle effects. The water looks like real water, and the fur on the rats look real. It is true eye candy and perfectly complements the story.One of the major themes in Ratatouille is the combination of tastes. And with the juicy plot and sweet effects Ratatouille is a scrumptious treat. This is a work of art and is a true classic. To call this film Best Animated Feature would be an insult. For this film isn't the Best Animated Feature of 2007 but the Best film of 2007.Pixar has always been the leader in CGI films, and Ratatouille just shows that Pixar is still the best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Ratatouille Is one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever seen!,"This Movie in my opinion, is the best movie Pixar has created to date. If not the best Animated movie ever, ONE of the best movies ever made. Now why do I make this statement? Is it childish at parts? Yes! Is it silly at times? yes! Is it a work of great movie making on just about all levels? YES! If you don't get ""IT"" then that's a shame. If you do then you will be entertained! Regardless where your from or background. The nuances of everything was really very intelligent and well put together If you don't laugh or find some kind of humor in this movie. You either have no sense of humor. OR...You have a giant stick up your butt! And your probably going into the theater wanting to hate it in the first place. If you don't find this film heartwarming then you must be a very sad person :( And if you can't find anything positive at all to take from this movie then your just a plain Ol' ""Hater"" as its said.Mr. EGO's (Peter Ol Toole) Narrative at the end was perfect that summed up exactly what I was thinking. And there was not one Over the top stereo type personality. But yet you definitely knew who was the antagonist and protagonist.Now this kind of story has been told before. The ""You can be more in life then what every one says your lot in it should be"" But I have to say it was told this time in a new and very clever way. A Rat chef! If you were a rat, How far removed would you be from that? Now If you hate the writing. You all know if most other writers that were going to make this film were just looking at how much money it could make. They Would have played it safe and It would have ended like this. (The guy would not have gotten the girl until the very end when he saves the restaurant that didn't get shut down. And the restaurant became a huge success) That's one of the things I liked about it. It didn't have THE PERFECT happy ending. There's nothing wrong with that though. But It did end happily. And there's nothing wrong with that either. I prefer a happy ending personally. But it showed you not all things turn out how you think they were going to. But then doe's anything every really do.Now I could go on about Ratatouille. OH I could go on about how much I liked this movie and why. But I think you get where I'm coming from. And one last thing the animation and directing were Fantastic. About ten Minutes in I stopped thinking about it being an animated movie. thoroughly delightful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Best movie 2007 so far!,"There's so much to say about Ratatouille I can't even know where to start... Another Disney Pixar masterpiece! It surely is! I've thought that after their greatest Finding Nemo, there was NO WAY they could even match that genius... but they did!! And it was spectacular! I had my eyes wet all over the film, not by nostalgia or whatever, but its brilliance amazed me so much I felt like in heaven... It was a feast to the eyes, those colors and those views were amazing, perfect, flawless... Best in animation ever seen, not even the colorful Pacific Reef in Finding Nemo could beat the elegance and perfection of Paris in Ratatouille. The characters, oh the characters! There were so many! But the difference with so many movies was the REALITY of them, I loved those to love, and hated those to hate! They were so multi-dimensional! The story, sooooo perfect! I must say, there are some films that are stressing with so much problems and conflicts with characters that last for the whole film, but in Ratatouille every problem was solved quickly so i enjoyed EVERY SINGLE MINUTE of it!!! The action was also incredible! I wanted to run along with Remy, very impressive. To finish, the conclusion was incredible! I can remember when the critic tells the chef to surprise him, I could see myself telling that to Disney Pixar, and they absolutely followed my wishes! They really really surprised me!!

"Pixar's best, most subtle and most beautifully animated yet","Firstly, in almost all of the Pixar films before it, the creators had to create and establish a very specific world: in A Bug's Life it is the world of the anthill, in Monsters Inc it is the alternate monster universe, in The Incredibles it is the sort of retro 1950's-throwback-style world populated by superheroes, and the same can be applied to their other works as well. Ratatouille, on the other hand, takes place within the real-life, contemporary ""human"" world, and thus does not need to establish the physics and dynamics of its own alternate universe  much humour is usually derived from the parallels between it and our real world and from the absurdity of the mechanics of these universes.Another major difference is how Bird treats his themes. Major, educational themes have been the center of most animated movies since the oldest days of Disney and right up through the contemporary Pixar age. But what can more than certainly be said about pretty much all the rest of the Pixar movies is that they never try to hide their messages  in fact, I thought that the over-obviousness and simplicity of the message that appeared in Cars was what made it slightly less-appreciated among other Pixar projects. In Ratatouille, not only is the film absolutely brimming with overlaying themes and messages, but Bird at the same time never lets them take the wheel, and always keeps them looming overhead the actual plot and storyline. Themes such as friendship, loyalty, teamwork, and accepting the different and the unexpected can all be found in the film, but never once does Bird force-feed us his message, and for that I appreciate him all the more.The story itself is of course fantastically executed and an absolute wonder to behold. It's touching, original, extremely clever and just plain fun. It's crazy but never enters the territory of absurd, and we always believe in it. The dynamics between Remy and Linguini are also brilliantly carried out, and they work together so incredibly well. But ultimately, the key to the film's success is the utter believability and realism of its characters. We totally believe in the dynamics between the two and in their own particular character traits and quirks. It's just so well done; and I must also mention that the character of Remy was designed in the most absolutely and utterly adorable, eat-you-up way possible! He just puts a smile on your face every time he wiggles his little nose.The animation in the film is nothing short of revolutionary. It is easily the most incredibly well done and the best looking computer animated film made yet, in every aspect. Images that were once flat back in Toy Story become so realistically alive, it's quite mind-boggling to tell you the truth. The use of focus in the animation is so incredibly spot-on perfect and works so realistically in comparison to how it would actually work in real life, its almost hard to believe that this isn't done in real cameras. Add to that absolutely stunning lighting, colouration and textures, and you get some elements of the film that almost seem completely real  just look for example at the piece of bread near the beginning of the film, or the water in the river or the texture of the cobblestones on the street. It's unbelievable! I usually don't refer to the voice acting in a movie because I feel its redundant, and I'm also not a fan of using big celebrity voices just for the sake of having them, unless they are actually used dynamically in the animated character itself or if they are seamlessly integrated, as they are in Ratatouille. But I must bring up one particular vocal performance in this film that just had me grinning every time his character came on screen and his voice started booming: Casting Peter O'Toole as the voice of food critic Anton Ego was a stroke of genius quite unlike any other voice casting decision in ANY other animated film ever  or at least since the casting of Robin Williams as the voice of the Genie in Aladdin. His voice, instantly recognizable, fits the character of Ego so incredibly well, it's almost eerie. And he of course gives a brilliant performance, creating one of the most humorous characters in the entire film.Ratatouille is another five-star success added to Pixar's already high-standard repertoire. It is just as touching, human, real, convincing and emotional as any other Pixar film, although to its credit Bird makes sure that its major themes and messages aren't too obviously or prominently featured, keeping everything subtle and putting the plot and characters first  which are all equally brilliantly done. The animation is the most vivid, perfect and absolutely beautiful in any animated movie yet, and it all fits in together perfectly with the very sly and unique Pixar sense of humour. I of course expected nothing less from the studio, and am now even more brimming with confidence about their next project, Wall-E, after the slight stumble that was last year's Cars. Easily the best movie yet this summer.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Very disappointing,"I went to this movie last night with high expectations. I certainly didn't expect anything of the brilliance of Toy Story or Finding Nemo, but I expected at least the quality of the Incredibles or Cars. Instead I got a pretty good movie that happens to rank at the bottom of all the Pixar movies made so far. Only mildly entertaining, Ratatouille is a pretty significant dropoff for Pixar in their new era after selling their studios to Disney. I would recommend this film for kids 9-12 but don't go in with high expectations. You will likely be disappointed if you do. My 14 year old daughter enjoyed it, but we both agreed that it didn't rate even as well as Surf's up and not even close to Happy Feet. More on the level of Over the Hedge or Monster House really.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Rats, what a let down.","Pixar are the computer boffins behind such great films as 'Toy Story', 'Finding Nemo' and 'The Incredible's' so it is with excitement I look forward to watching their new film 'Ratatouille', but I have to say that I was thoroughly disappointed. The idea is basically about a rat who longs to be one of the greatest chef's in the world, lucky then that he lives under Paris, unlucky that he is a rat. Basically that's it, there are no really cool characters like the turtles in 'Nemo' or the aliens in 'Toy Story', there is his unbelieving dad, fat brother, bumbling chef accomplice who are all quite unassuming the only one with anything to them is the evil head chef who runs the kitchen with an iron fist. There is none of the magic that made earlier films so appealing for young and old and the jokes are thin and far between or have been done before. I think the whole thing is let down by the idea, it just isn't as strong as previous outings. There's a loose theme of humans hating rats as they are pests but it never really gets of the ground and a kitchen doesn't really allow for many action sequences. The animation is as you'd expect flawless and the rats (despite being pests) are all fluffy cute so the kids will probably love them but all in all this is probably the worst film to come from the Pixar stable, which considering past achievements and their normal level of originality ends up being a bit more of a let down.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
He calls it his Tiny ChefRatatouille,"Brad Bird is by far the best writer/director of animated films coming out of America in a long time. Besides a Hayao Miyazaki, there is no one else with the track record that this guy has. From The Iron Giant to the Incredibles to now Ratatouille, Bird just gets better and better with each new move. This new Pixar installment is definitely the most intellectually stimulating yet, but really which of his films haven't been intelligent first, kiddie-catering second? Ratatouille is by all means cinematic in scope and execution. There is nothing to this movie that screams animation besides the fact that it is a cartoon. The characters are all well fleshed out with emotions and inner struggle to survive the lives they want at the expense of that laid before them. Each frame is also composed with a sense of cinematography for real life. The expanses of Paris are breathtaking to behold and many camera movements stay within the constraints of a true machine there to capture the action. Bird's world on display is all encompassing and you will be fully immersed into the tale, no matter what age, because it never loses its integrity or ability to surprise with its never ceasing authenticity.Pixar will always be at the top of the computer graphic echelon because they have never catered to the increasing trend of dumbing down to the lowest common denominator. It appears that the current trend in America has been to try and make everything too equal, thus simplifying things in order for those less motivated souls to understand and laugh at, at the expense of the intellectuals which should be allowed some intellectual stimulation as well. Rather than go for the ""fart jokes"" and clichéd old-hat humor, Disney's newly bought animation studio has proved time and again that story is paramount and that without it, no means of skill or effects can survive. Locking up a talent like Bird for his most recent two films shows the dedication they have in getting the right people involved in the creative process.The backbone impetus of this story is not at all truly original. It is very much an ugly- duckling type tale of someone who has decided to go along a path different then his people have for generations. While being slightly ostracized at home, he goes into the world in order to find meaning and a use for his extraordinary skill. Since that skill is a keen sense of smell, what better occupation than gourmet chef is there for mixing those flavors at his service in unique and wonderful ways? Unfortunately, our hero is a rat, and we all know that they don't go with hygienic kitchens very well. He must find a kind soul to help him do what he was born to do, and with that fateful meeting in Gusteau's restaurant, our tale unfolds. By going against the stealing mentality of his fellow rats and living amongst the humans, I was starting to think we would eventually get to a point where his clan speaks of how he has angered the rat Gods and their supply of garbage has been cleaned up by environmentalists around Europe. I quickly hit myself in the head, remembered that this wasn't Happy Feet with rats, and sat back to enjoy a real fairytale story that didn't try to shove an agenda down my throat. Fairy tales tell of morals and happiness and originality succeeding over prejudice and Disney/ Pixar still knows how to deliver.Animation-wise, Ratatouille is a sight to behold. The fur on each rat is as tactile as that on Sully from Monsters Inc. and the liquids on display are gorgeous. Whether sewer water, Parisian streams, or blood red wine, each fluid is rendered with amazing clarity and realism. Even the human characters, something not often attempted by Pixar, are caricatured enough to make them slightly abnormal so that instead of looking at their humanistic flaws, we see them as just other animated creatures in a world of their own. Also, the set pieces are elaborate and highly detailed. The restaurant dining room is fantastically displayed and each swoop through the double doors of the kitchen brings you into a new world beyond the sinks and utensils. Even the underbelly passages of the rats are highly detailed as we go through them fast and furiously while our hero Remy runs to get above ground, going past numerous rooms that are seen through cracksa comically French domestic dispute among them until we get our first glimpse at the grandeur of Paris.Despite the beautiful graphics and the unobtrusively effective voice-overswhen you find you aren't wondering who is who, you know the acting is successfully integrated into the wholeit is the story that really shines. Bird has culled his imagery from many sources, including a bit of what I feel is Tim Burton for the nemesis food critic Anton Ego who eerily reminded me of Christopher Lee, yet has made everything his own. Remy the rat must fight against his heritage and his very being in order to live his life the way he wants to. There is a lot of comedy involved in getting the human Linguini to become his friend and partner on the journey to culinary perfection, but there is even more heart behind it all. We are treated to some nicely quirky supporting roles, but none are ever put to the forefront in order to overshadow the real stars. While not the ensemble these types of films usually are, our leads are strong and never falter to the point you wish we had more of the others. I accepted the terms of the plot early on and never tired of the journey Brad Bird and company led me on. Pitch-perfect at every turn.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Great movie, maybe too intense for small kids","This is a great film. Pixar has done it again, in a silly, serious, very fun way. The animation is top-notch. I agree with other posters that the scenery is extremely well done. The colors are magnificent, especially the sunsets in Paris. Makes you want to move there right now. There are several laugh-out-loud moments, and even a couple that brought a tear to my eye. However, I'm glad I pre-screened it before I brought my four-year-old. There are some scenes that are too intense for her to handle on the big screen. I will definitely purchase the DVD, but will not be bringing her to the theatre.

Excellent Bravop Magnifique,"I just came out of a preview screening of Ratatouille with my 2 kids, a 3 year old boy and an almost 7 year girl and all three of us adored the movie.Of all the summer movies I have seen so far, including Spider-man 3, Fantastic 4 #2, Ocean's 13 and Knocked Up, this is by far the best one.The first 20 minutes is a little slow, but then it picks up and it's simply excellent.Funny, touching, deep, it's all there.

This movie was definitely memorable!  ^o^,"This was definitely the work I was expecting from Iron Giant's Brad Bird. The Incredibles was only so-so (and a little over-hyped). Ratatoullie, on the other hand, was just like cooking magic. There are some scenes that are fast pace, a little romance, some scenes that are funny, and some scenes that are just perfect in the middle.No matter how many times I've seen the Ratatoullie trailers (including the Tube's 9 min. preview), those were definitely just a small percentage of what to expect from the movie. You got human aspects and animal aspects mixed in nicely together.The Pixar short before the movie was pretty funny and heart-warming too (just like all their other shorts). You could tell that it was a practice animation for Pixar's next film, Wall-E.Thank you Pixar Animation staff, John Lasseter, and Brad Bird for your hard work! ^O^",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It's OK but not Pixar at it's very best best,"This movie is brilliantly made and the story is pretty good too.So why have I only given it a six out of ten?I just don't think it is Pixar at it's very best.I found the film to be a little bit too long and I even felt a bit bored after about an hour or so.There can be absolutely no doubt that there has been a hell of a lot of hard work gone on here and the makers can feel proud of their efforts.It's just that the movie didn't hold my attention too well though it did pick up towards the end.It feels a little churlish to only give such a well made film an average mark but I have to be honest and say that I would rank it below other Pixar works such as A Bug's Life,Finding Nemo and well below the two Toy Story films.It is well voiced,it looks fabulous but at the end of the day it didn't float my boat.I know there are loads of you out there that will disagree strongly with this review and I can understand that.But when you are up against the likes of Toy Story you really do have to produce something special and this wasn't it for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Truly Moving Picture,"I saw this film on June 15th, 2007 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.Pixar has an incredible streak of commercial and artistic animation successes. This is their 8th in a row, and their riskiest. Toys and cars and bugs and fish and monsters and superheroes are easier to make endearing than a RAT. But, PIXAR pulls it off.This is a story of a French rat, Remy, who dreams to be more. Instead of eating garbage like his family and friends, he aspires to create great food like his hero Gusteau. Gusteau is a famous chef and cooking writer and television cooking star and restaurant owner. Gusteau's motto is ""Anyone Can Cook."" The bad news is Gusteau dies, but the good news is he comes back as a ghost or a figment of the rat's imagination to aid our rat in his dreams.The rat arrives at Gusteau's restaurant and uses the body of a lowly garbage boy to follow the rat's instructions and to create great food. The rat even moves in with the garbage boy.The animation is stunningly good. PIXAR has made the animation more detailed and more nuanced for every one of their succeeding films and this tradition continues. You learn about cooking and your mouth waters throughout the film. The Ratatouille, a French vegetable stew, can be tasted and smelled in the theater. By the way, the ""Rat"" in Ratatouille has nothing to do with a ""rat.""Remy is inspiring. Here is a character that will not settle on his expected life, but strives for greatness and to add to the world. And he will not give up or be discouraged. The ugly(?) rat becomes beautiful.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Comfort Movie,I cannot rate this film any lower than a 10/10. When ever I feel down this movie just makes me whole again. Anyone can cook!,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Surprisingly conventional,"Modern animated features have often been marked by profound ruminations of life and death 'Toy Story', 'Madagascar') or by hip references to popular culture (the 'Shrek' movies). But 'Ratatouille', this year's smash hit, it by contrast a very conventional animation, a straightforward cartoon story inspired by the simple pun that gives the film its name; indeed, it reminded me in some ways of 'Wallace and Grommit', although (obviously) without the northern English flavour. I liked the animation of France (Citroen D-Seies included) and Peter O' Toole is very funny, voicing a snooty restaurant critic, but I think a chance was missed to make the rats as physically repulsive as most people find them in real life; a cuddly rat is sort of missing the point. And overall, I found (as an adult viewer), the same joke stretched a little thin by the end of the film; a film where a woman shoots up her own house to kill a rat (as happens early in this movie) is not one to encourage dark thoughts about the nature of life.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The best animated movie in the world!,"When I was a child Ratatouille was my favorite animated movie and to be honest, still it is. I think Pixar teaches us through its morals a lot of useful things in its movies. In Ratatouille for example we should respect animals and don't treat them worse because they have feelings too. Maybe they can not talk but they are still living beings and our friends who sometimes need our help. Rats don't belong to favorite animals in people's opinion but they are animals too and this is not their fold how they were created.I like this film for its French atmosphere and that was created very interesting and pleasant. Rats were shown in that film friendly. The animation was done very cleverly. If anyone is wondering if this movie is worth watching, I definitely say yes!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Oui, it's that good","In a season virtually filled to the brim with disappointing follow-up installments, Pixar Animation Studios and director Brad Bird cook up yet another winner in ""Ratatouille,"" a story of a rat named Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) who hankers to hone his improbable talent of mixing the right ingredients to make a delightful fare. The members of his colony don't recognize his passion, if not entirely against it, especially his father (Brian Dennehy) who constantly reminds him that humans are dangerous. But as someone who looks up to the late Chef Gusteau, Remy believes what the celebrated culinary expert believes: anyone can cook.But an attempt to prove this to his brother Emile (Peter Sohn) causes him to separate from the other members of his colony, eventually ending up in Paris, and in Gusteau's once five-star restaurant. Now reduced to three stars, it's run by Chef Skinner (Ian Holm), a collusive restaurateur who plans to use Gusteau's prestigious name to sell mass-marketed frozen foods. A series of events bring Remy and Linguini, a bumbling garbage boy working at the restaurant, together. Driven by Remy's desire to cook and Linguini's desperate effort not to get fired after a kitchen mishap, the two team up to prepare the restaurant's new menu items that has the elites of Paris appreciating the restaurant again.Soon, Linguini gets all the credit Remy deserves and Remy's loyalty to his family members are questioned, eventually leading to some sort of a falling out between the two even as renowned food critic Anton Ego is set to do a review of the restaurant.""Ratatouille"" is firstly a sight to behold (ah, Paris!) and praising Pixar for it seems as effective as calling a fast food restaurant unhealthy. It just is. What really sets the studio's projects apart from other films of its nature (I'm consciously trying to keep myself from labeling animation as a genre; you know, Brad Bird... ) is how their stories successfully embed genuine motivations to their characters while adding nice blend of drama and humor, without resorting to an overkill of pop culture references.I understand Disney's dilemma, though, in marketing this film. Save for the fact that it's an animated movie featuring a talking rat, Bird's follow-up to his equally laudable ""The Incredibles"" is placed in such a sophisticated setting with a tad too many culinary jargon which younger audiences might not easily appreciate. In fact, it seems it might appeal to parents more than to their kids. But it's paced well, is thoroughly engaging, and the cast provides memorable voice performances that the movie overall is a, well, delicious experience.In the end, ""Ratatouille"" is a visually pleasing, touching and humorous tale that further proves Pixar and Bird a formidable combination.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
My all time favorite  movie now,"I have to say, bloody good voice acting, fantastic animation and a wonderful script. I love how its a light hearted/romantic comedy which is animated and best of all, about food. The characters are all wonderful, Remy who is such an adorable, Linguine which i think is a fantastic name and Corlette which is such a cool character, actually i think all the chefs are really cool.I think the reference to Augsute Escoffier and Louis Bernard is also a really great thing to do, i think though it would have been better if they had the 3 stars like the Michelin guide instead of 5. Small complaints mind you.But wow the animation, i have to say i got hungry watching it, and i love all the reference to some really old school French food, and sweetbread is so cool to have a mentioning, i wonder how parents are gonna explain that one to the kids eh? :D Anyway, if you don't watch this, your gonna miss a great, great film, great job on pixar and everyone in the cast.

Anyone Can Cook,"In the country of France, the rat Remy has accurate taste and smell, and he worships the chef Auguste Gusteau. People uses to say that the best food in the world is in Paris, more precisely in Gusteau's, and Remy dreams on becoming a chef. On the same day that his idol dies after reading a bad review of the arrogant critic Anton Ego, Remy gets lost from the clan of his father in the sewers and ends in Paris in front of the famous restaurant. Remy does not resist and goes to the kitchen, improving the soap that is being prepared with ingredients and spices. The clumsy garbage boy Linguini receives the credits for the successful recipe; he is promoted to cook and starts a partnership with the little chef. But the greedy chef Skinner is not happy with the success of Linguini that is jeopardizing his future project for Gusteau's.""Ratatouille"" is a delightful animation, with a very funny and original story. It is inconceivable to imagine a rat in the fanciest restaurant of Paris; imagine a rat as a prominent chef, having a clan of rats in the kitchen helping him to prepare sophisticated meals for the upper-class of Paris and a harsh critic of restaurants. Only this sequence would be enough to make laugh. But the story has nice characters and good messages about the importance of making a dream come true and creativity in your work, friendship and loyalty. The story has many plot points and the resolution is great. In the end, I loved this animation. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Ratatouille""",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Lacks the usual quick-fire one-liners of other Pixar films but is up to the usual quality in every other regard,"Evicted from his home and separated from his family, rat Remy is living the dream as an unwelcome guest in the kitchen of the famous Gusteau Restaurant in Paris. His passion and gift is cookery and a series of events sees him with soup that had been messed by garbage boy Linguini. Chef Skinner is ready to fire Linguini for his meddling until the customers love ""his"" improvised soup. Skinner keeps him on but Linguini knows the truth, striking a deal with Remy where the latter provides the cookery and the former provides the ""looking like a human"" bit.Although it won the Oscar for best film, Ratatouille got mixed reviews from critics on release. Watching it for myself I must admit that it exposes the long-term value of the ""best animated feature"" aware because it is not a film that should show up as ""best"" unless it is in a very short list (which of course it was). This is not to say that the film is no good though and indeed it is a perfectly good story told in a very slick, amusing and engaging way with all the usual quality one would expect from Pixar in regards animation. The story has the usual moral about the importance of the heart over appearance and in this regard it works really well, with a touching character at the core. I refer of course to Remy, because Linguini is all a bit wet as a character.This doesn't matter too much because Linguini is rarely the sole focus in the way that Remy is. The story develops well across the running time and I was never bored once but, and here's the thing, I didn't laugh that often. For me the story was strong enough so that the lack of really good consistent laughs didn't bother me but I can understand why it is an issue for others. In many ways it is because Pixar are victims of their own success and we now expect the strong heartfelt story to be underlain by constant quick fire gags and one-liners. The lack of the latter is not a weakness in the film but it does slightly disappoint until you get into the story.It is not without laughs though but they are more general and less smart than you might expect. The big colourful action is amusing and entertaining and it all drives the good story forward effectively. The voice cast for once is not filled with famous A-list names but you don't feel their absence. Oswalt is the best main character and is better served than Romano with material. Holm is nearly unrecognisable but good, although I'm not so sure about Garofalo's mixed attempt at accent. Dennehy and Sohn are fun in support while O'Toole is a real good piece of casting.Overall this is a really good film that delivers a consistently engaging story with heart and humour. It is not the usual quick-fire one-liner stuff one might expect but it is still an very enjoyable film that both parents and children will enjoy.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
51st best film of all time?,"I enjoyed the animation and the characters, but really...this is, by vote, the 51st best movie of all time? Votes like this are how Madonna ends up on Histories Most Influential People. I felt like someone was given a title and five hours to come up with a plot so they could play off that title. The plot was not special. I doubt they used the entire five hours. The premise I cheerfully accept as fantasy, but I doubt anyone living in a slum area or anyone with a sense of hygiene would find it all that humorous. The only saving grace for this story is that the rats washed their hands. One of the kids in the theatre wanted to go home and put out some food for the rats. Nice job (NOT).",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The Rat in the Hat,"Ratatouille is a sweet little film about a Parisian rat with ambitions to become France's top chef, and a young dish-washer who may just be his only hope. The plot takes a number of clever twists and turns and delivers some unpredictable elements, which keep what could have been 'just another Pixar' quite fresh. Setting the film in France, and giving it just a pinch of French absurdist comedy for seasoning was a stroke of brilliance. The voice talent is also quite excellent - especially Ian Holm's ""Chef Skinner"" - who also does a mean Golem impression btw - and Jeanine Garafolo's ""Collette"".I am generally not a big fan of talking animal movies, though purely animated ones are definitely preferable to those that morph real animals. But Ratatouille even does this very differently - the rats can understand our language, but we don't get theirs. And, other than their very military approach to getting things done, and the lead character's odd cooking talent, they generally behave like rats and have rat motivations.The movie is fun and funny and, at times, quite heart-warming. The rats are absolutely adorable and even do their own stunts! The human characters, though less sympathetic, are some of Pixar's best!

Unengaging Story,"If you love snobby French cooking, you'll love this.If you're looking for a fun movie like ""The Incredibles"", you'll be disappointed.It's not really a funny movie -- more of an ""Eek!"" (will the rat be killed?) and ""Awww"" (isn't that heartwarming?) kind of movie.The animation is superb -- but the story is weak.How Remy the Rat controls his human is just dumb. They lost me there. That and when hundreds of rats swarm a house, a kitchen -- I was on the side of the exterminator then.One rat in a kitchen MIGHT be cute. Hundreds are horrible.I loved Patton Oswalt as Remy and Peter O'Toole as the mean food critic. But Janeane Garofalo can barely be understood under her fakey French accent. (Which raises a good point: how come some of these French people have French accents -- but some have English or American?

Absolutely beautiful - visually and thematically,"One of the most wonderful things about a Pixar movie is the sense of discovery. The sense that, no matter how many commercials you've seen, no matter how much you've heard about the plot, you're going to discover hidden layers with each viewing that make the experience more of an event than a movie. Ratatouille fits this description to a tee. I went to the special sneak preview tonight and, honestly, I have not heard an audience this involved in a film since Finding Nemo four years ago and I would be thrilled if this movie found that large of an audience as well, because it certainly deserves it. There is a grace and a beauty to this movie that is present even in the physical comedy sequences. After a summer of sequels, how refreshing to see such a startlingly original story told so artistically with such a high level of humor and warmth. When it opens on June 29th, go see it.

Shockingly Ordinary,"Just watched this last night. I was shocked at how ... ordinary ... it was. Every other Pixar film I've seen (haven't yet caught Cars) has been special in some way. Toy Story was different. Monsters, Inc. incredibly original. The Incredibles was aimed at a slightly older crowd, but somehow made a surprisingly adult film for 8 or 10 year olds. WallE was brilliant.This was not brilliant. The mouse able to read and communicate with humans seemed straight out the cliché book for animated movies. In an attempt to maintain some realism they do not allow the mouse to talk to humans, but forced to work around this the mouse can use the main character like a marionette, a far less plausible and more ridiculous invention. The morality of Remy's desire to ""make something"" instead of ""taking"" even falls short, as down to the end of the movie the rats continue to be on the taking end, with only Remy rising slightly above that. The main human character is dull-witted and undeveloped, and the movie fails to connect with the viewer on any emotional level -- exactly what makes the other Pixar films so wonderful.Not to completely trash the film, it is amusing and worth a few laughs. Compared to many kids movies it is passable. Kids will be entertained and will laugh, but ultimately I felt the film was standard fare, far far FAR short of any other Pixar film I've seen.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A charming and cute movie,"Pixar never disappoints me: ""Ratatouille"" just like ""Finding Nemo"", ""Monsters Inc."" and ""The Incredibles"", it's a funny and enjoyable animated film that the whole family could enjoy.Directed by the talented animator Brad Bird (Director of ""The Iron Giant"" and ""The Incredibles"") ""Ratatouille, is more simplistic than his other films, but it is still pretty good: The animation is flawless, the characters are likable, the voice acting it's pretty good and the story, despite being somewhat predictable it's quite fun to watch. Peter O'Toole makes a great work as the critic Anton Ego, and the ending is one of the best that I've ever watched in a animated film. This was the best movie of the 2007, and it wasn't overrated. Actually, I think it was pretty underrated. Even if it is a film for kids, the adults can enjoy it as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The film that launched a thousand rats,"""Ratatouille"", to pick a culinary metaphor, is, like the curate's egg, excellent... in parts. That is, parts of it are excellent, some parts grate, and a good deal of it is good without being especially outstanding. The film has the disarming forethought to get its riposte against criticism in first, in the person of the critic Anton Ego.But my feelings about this picture are on the whole approbatory, while undoubtedly mixed. I didn't like it as much as ""The Incredibles"", and, thinking back, I wonder how much of that stems from Pixar being simply less comfortable out of the familiar territory of the American suburbs. A good deal of what grated on me was the perceived Americanisms, from the gun-toting granny to the unsubtle nature of the self-help message (and just what is a 'patootie' or a 'burrito' anyway? 'Corn dog' was at least explained...) The use of accents is also somewhat scattershot: the villains (inevitably) are played by English actors, the rat-heroes (inevitably) are Americans, while the one female speaking role is played with a comedy French accent -- as if the characters were not all (presumably) talking French.Pixar's animators have obviously spent a lot of time studying rats, as well as -- I would guess -- researching the professional kitchen. These aren't your classic Disney characters with gloved hands, human bodies, and a token animal head and tail. No-one except the owners of pet rats will care that the depiction massively downplays the importance (and size) of the rats' tails and whiskers: a rat's tail is as long as his body and as strong as an extra limb, while he doesn't so much sniff at things as feel them with his impressive 270-degree array of whiskers. My only other caveat would be that the rats in the film seem to spend an awful lot of their time with ears laid back: a real rat's ears are swivelling radar-dishes, high and round and on the alert, and relocating them for most of the shots to a more 'human' position, low down on the head, has a rather odd effect on the characters' expression.But since I for one am a rat owner, I appreciated the way that Pixar have captured their heels-up scamper and their funny trundling walk, their habit of carrying things with their chins raised, their athletic climbing abilities and above all their superb sense of smell; if anyone could design a new dish for a restaurant simply by sniffing it, it would undoubtedly be a rat! I also appreciated the fact that the rats in this story can't actually talk to the humans -- in fact, there's one shot towards the beginning that makes it plain that all they hear is squeaking. This isn't, as it might have been, the story of a boy who can magically converse with animals; rats and humans have to learn to communicate without words. (It's a tribute to the plot that it didn't even occur to me until after the film was over that it was in any way odd that the rats, on the other hand, could not only understand but read every word the humans used!) The process by which Remy discovers that he can remote-control Linguini is, I suppose, ridiculous in a real-life context, but seemed to make sense at the time...Plot-wise, I found the start of the film fairly slow, with all the emotional depth of your average Mickey Mouse, though I did like the concept of the rats' having an organised escape plan. The main picture was preceded by a brief short centred around the quintessential US theme of alien abduction, which had the young audience in stitches but which I'm afraid I failed to find funny in the least -- slapstick cruelties were never my thing -- and this may have jaundiced me.Things looked up once Remy reached Paris, although I found the heavy moral emphasis on the theft of a crumb absurd from a rodent view: how else can a rat eat? Plough his own fields, sow his own wheat, set up his own bakery? In the context of the rest of the story, ""Don't foul your own nest"" might have been more apt than ""Thou shalt not steal"".The turn of events by which Remy becomes an undercover cook is effective, funny and strangely plausible, and from this point the film's quality remains fairly consistent throughout. One bonus is that there is no quasi-obligatory zany sidekick character; the nearest this film comes is in the shape of Remy's brother, and he doesn't get much screen time. But then generally speaking I didn't care much for the 'family' scenes. They mostly seemed to consist of spelling out moral messages in letters a yard high, plus the usual father-son bond fixation.Towards the end the film makes some brave choices, and it is at this point that it rises into the category of 'excellent' and gains some actual emotional depth. It doesn't stop with the fairy-tale ending of the rightful heir, nor yet with the victory over the ogre. The name of the film turns out to be highly significant after all, and our heroes are rewarded not by a pinnacle of magic inheritance, but with fruits of their own earning. A warning: there are some scenes at this point that may be genuinely distressing to young children... as opposed to the cartoon violence of the opening, at which they merely roared with laughter...The pictures of dead rats -- far more realistic than the cartoon-type characters -- I myself found very hard to bear because one of my own pets had died the previous day; the half-open mouth and fragile, curled limbs were the last I'd seen of her, too. I didn't weep when I buried her body, but there were several places during this film about rats when I missed her horribly. Which is, I suppose, a salute to its success.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It touched me unlike any other animated film...,"This film goes beyond my expectations. It is refreshingly unique, elegantly simple, exquisite, and delectable. The animation is just eye popping and the story is simply and greatly executed. I never imagined I would be convinced to eat (or at least find edible) food created by a rat. Remy is gorgeous and the city of Paris is breathtaking. Linguini and all the other characters are just truly marvelous, especially Anton Ego. His monologue at the end of the film, might just be one of the greatest voice performances in CGI animation history. By far the best animated movie of the year, and pretty much one of the best films of the year. Just shows that Pixar Animation Studios is simply the MVP at this game. This films goes into the books.

Magnifique!,"Another spectacular entry from Pixar... and Brad Bird is 3 for 3 in my book. From a foodie point of view, they hit exactly upon the joy and excitement of invention and creation in a kitchen... not to mention the pure energy and atmosphere of a busy restaurant.One of Bird's beliefs is that animation does not necessarily equal children's entertainment, and this is true here... I don't think Ratatouille is going to be the breakout children's movie that The Incredibles was. Don't get me wrong; I think kids will enjoy themselves. The pace is brisk and the humor continual. But there are so many layers to experience here... this movie will definitely bear up well through repeated viewings.The visuals are tremendous, especially the views of a rat running through walls and underground. The music was also memorable, although there's no Randy Newman-ish lyrics here.I recognized the name John Gilkey in the credits, and indeed the loose-limbed flailing of the young chef is reminiscent of Gilkey's physical comedy... although a 100% Animation disclaimer at the end of the movie stated that no motion capture was used. Still, i would have loved to be a fly on the wall the day Gilkey was modeling movement for Pixar's animators! (Gilkey was the lead comic figure in Cirque du Soleil's Qidam)Even if you aren't a Francophile or foodie, you will surely enjoy this delectable morsel of film-making and storytelling.

Delightful!,"""Ratatouille"" is Pixar's best film, animation-wise, to date. It is truly remarkable for its visual landscape, and the story is charming. I went to see it with my family, and we all enjoyed it.The rats, generally viewed as disgusting creatures, are rendered adorable, but not too unrealistic (Disneyfied), on screen. And Paris is recreated with Pixar's amazing animation--the chase across the boats on the Seine is particularly stunning. Scenes with cooking and dancing rats are also enjoyable. This film is worth watching for the quality of animation alone, but the exposition about cookery, the scenery of Paris, the cute characters, and the endearing storyline should provide entertainment for almost everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Pixar's masterpiece,"Remy, a simple mouse, dreams of being a cook. One day he meets Linguine, the assistant of a decadent restaurant, who doesn't have the slightest talent for cooking. The two combine to use Remy's cooking skills to regain the restaurant's prestige.Ratatouille is an animation of Pixar's finest stage. Before the company started making sequels, spin offs and repeating itself (as in the similarities between the spirit world of ""inside out"" and ""soul"").Here the story is extremely original and doesn't underestimate the intelligence of the audience. Despite many funny scenes, Ratatouille reminds us that the mouse is a sewer animal, not a friendly pet. Then we have the central conflict of the protagonist. The animation also pays homage to French culture, with the reconstitution of Paris, the culinary tradition and the friendly chansons. This background wall gives the film a charm.Technically the film is brilliant. Even though it was made almost twenty years ago, the animation could have been released yesterday. The film's atmosphere changes day, night, bright rooms, dark streets, rain, sun. Without losing quality. The camera movement is frantic and absolutely brilliant, following the little mouse's agile steps in places only a mouse could go.Ratatouille has several educational messages: appearances don't matter, an artist can come from anywhere, you have to step out of your comfort zone, etc.One of the best animations ever made. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Very entertaining,"The story of a rat chef struggling to break into a French restaurant kitchen full of humans.The visual and technical creative brilliance of the film is indisputable, and, from that point of view, is one of the best Pixar movie to the date. Unfortunately, the virtuosity of the animation is not matched by a brilliant script.The script, despite being entertaining, can be complicate for kids and not engaging enough for adults. The pacific living between rats and humans is an utopia and nothing is going to change that, so the start is non-believable. Then, the fact that the rat controls the human is again impossible and therefore non-believable. That is so because for that to work the rats would be able to communicate with humans by word. However, that part is real, as rats do not speak human language. So there is a mix of real and unreal things that never mix well. Better do all fantasy or all veridical, not half half. In fact, the story lacks of the internal logic that Pixar uses to make believable their characters. The dialogs are OK, but there is not enough humor, there are archetypal characters and situations, and looks like a movie targeted to school- holidays children.Nevertheless, it is a very enjoyable entertaining movie, pure eye candy, but closer to Disney than to Pixar's spirit.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"It is, how the French say...MAGNIFIQUE!","What a fantastic movie. I haven't enjoyed an animated film like this in years. Perhaps animation these days has become more of measure of how real we can make things look with technology. We have forgotten what makes classics like Jungle Book, Lion King, Aladdin & Beauty and the Beast forever remain in our hearts and our memories. I have seen Finding Nemo & Toy Story, and though I can appreciate the trailblazing methods in creating animation that is unbelievably life-like and impressive, I have always felt that something was lacking. It's that feel-good, lesson-learned, awe-inspiring, tear-jerking story that we all want to share with others close to us. This isn't a semi-musical, as many of the classics were, but an equally well constructed soundtrack does the trick too. How about creativity? Most animated films these days make a parody of real life through the eyes of an ant, car, fish, or chicken - while throwing in the voices of a few currently popular celebrities for good measure. But not this film, the voices are done by those who really fit the role/character, and the daily life of a rat is not paralleled with our daily lives. It does not monopolize the story. I felt an absolute joy watching Ratatouille (what a title too) - the plot, the creativity, the animation and the soundtrack; all were on point. Pure genius. If given a chance, this one may just become a classic. Bravo!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"RATATOUILLE (Brad Bird and Jan Pinkava, 2007) ***","Surprising exploring rodents in the kitchen is every restaurateur's (or housewife's) nightmare but the makers of this amiable animated movie turn that situation nicely on its head by making their protagonist a first-class gourmet that conveniently guides his artless master to fame and fortune in the culinary arts. Despite being the secret son of a famous (but subsequently) disgraced chef, he is engaged as a caretaker in his late father's bistro and mistreated by just everybody, especially the ambitious Head Chef who has his own designs on the place. However, his biggest nemesis is the fearsome food critic (splendidly voiced by Peter O'Toole) whose scathing review had sent his own father to an early grave and is intent on finding out just what the fuss of the revamped restaurant is all about. Aiding him in ditching his persecutors (including the belated appearance of a sanitary official) are a tough but conventional female cook, the friendly and constantly inventive mouse and, at the climax  just when everything seems lost after his employees quit him en masse upon discovering who the true gastronomical genius really is  the rat's entire family who find themselves engaged as impromptu cooks!

The Best Movie Ever Made.,"This could be the best movie ever made.After watching this movie 3 times back to back, I can't seem to find one single flaw in this film. There is a plethora of education, history, comedy, romance, french culture and of course, cooking education. I can't go about my daily life after watching this film without trying to imagine a rat in the kitchen, such a revelation to the cooking industry. Also, understanding the tough and falsely assumed life of a rat is wild to think about, all these assumptions about how a rat goes about his life is wrong. One couldn't not know how a rat lives his life, only a rat would know. After watching this, I see Linguini as the Lebron or Michael Jordan of french cuisine, only a great duo could pull off a masterful dish like represented in this beautiful masterpiece of a movie. If anybody says that they have seen a better movie then Ratatouille, know that they are wrong and have clearly garbage taste in film. I hope some really critics can find this useful unlike these hooligans writing and leaving 1 star reviews.

My Favorite Film,"As a cinephile, most of my activity currently is, and will continue to be, confined to Letterboxd. However, in setting up my IMDb account, I figured I should be thorough and do all of the recommended account setup stuff here. Here I am.I'm 22 years old, fresh out of college. I've enjoyed art, music, and film pretty much my whole life, including works from Pixar. I have watched over 700 movies as of writing this, and I'm just getting started. The final thing to do in setting up my account here is to write a movie review, so I hope it says a lot that out of all the 700+ movies I have watched, Ratatouille is the one I've decided to talk about.Many films I watched as a child have, over time, failed to retain their positive reputations from me. But far fewer have ventured through to my adulthood and have come out enhanced. Ratatouille has so many brilliant layers to it that I couldn't possible discuss them all. To spin a quote from Anton Ego, this masterpiece is immeasurably more meaningful than my praise designating it so. It is wildly creative, strikingly gorgeous, heartwarming, funny, emotional, intense, rich with themes, immersion, and the pure idea that every individuals' passions matter. Ratatouille is something I can watch no matter what mood or situation I am in and will always feel better by the end.

American Pop Culture Meets French Haute Cuisine (Talking Rats are Involved),"This is probably the most creative, whimsical entry in the Pixar canon of animated films. I've now watched it twice: the first time a few years ago with my then 6-year old daughter, before going on the dark ride at Disneyland Paris (among the best dark rides out there), and picking up a French-speaking Remy (the rat) stuffed animal for her younger brother. We watched it again recently after both kiddos had developed an interest in cooking and baking. And this movie only deepened that interest. While it satirizes both American pop culture, in the form of corporate mass-production, like ""Chef Gusteau's Frozen Burritos,"" and French cuisine, though more gently, with the premise that even Ratatouille, a ""peasant's dish,"" can become a gastronomic extravagance; the most important lesson is the idea that everyone can learn to cook well, at least with some talented instruction. The video game that comes with the blu ray release is also a fun way to learn about French-style food ingredients and preparation, and was also a good excuse when my wife suggested that I stop building up the blu ray collection now that we have Disney+! When we drove by Hardee's recently, my son complained that they gave themselves a star rating even though they don't deserve it.

Truly excellent,"Nowadays I don't believe the first reviews that appear here on IMDb; most of the time they say the movie is excellent etc., yeah, as they are written by plants, studio people who want to generate excitement and make the movie successful. It was a relief to see Ratatouille is really, truly excellent. The reason I did not give it 10/10 is simple: maybe some of the dialogues should have been trimmed a bit; sometimes the talking parts seemed to be a bit slower and longer than they should have been. And that's all what I can say on the negative side. Ratatouille is great. It is heartfelt, it is moving, it has style, great French feeling, it has lovable characters (especially Remy, of course), great story and, again, except from some man-to-man dialogues, every second of the movie shows creativity, care and a really high skill that the team at Pixar has. I loved the talking scenes with Remy as his gestures are great, also seeing his little heart pumping all the time etc. makes him instantly lovable. And the non-talking scenes (call them 'action scenes', not as if it was an action movie) are always so skillfully directed and effective that I was totally amazed. I haven't enjoyed an animated movie like this for years; I think it is among the three best Pixar movies (the other two being Finding Nemo and The Incredibles). I just can't express how much I loved it. Pixar is really the heir to (Walt) Disney as Remy is for Gusto - as both really do know how to serve food that is perfect even for the most hateful critic...",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A Rat who Cooks in Paris?  If it's Pixar - Yes.,"Brad Bird really put himself on the line with this strange concoction of a film. The only way this concept could work for the length of a feature (at 1 hour and 50 minutes - that's an eternity in animation time), is to go all out. Indeed, that's what this epic does and succeeds. From a floating imaginary chef to hair pulling as puppetry, the film is stuffed full of little details and subplots. No, you can't let a film with a strange Tom and Jerry feel to it become the central part of the film, so the character of Linguini and his own strife counter-balance the rat's story. Indeed, Linguini, a clutz in the Jerry Lewis vein, carries the second half of the story, with the rat mostly disappearing in many scenes. What Brad Bird accomplishes, meanwhile, is that Pixar magic, where you get an unexpected emotional attachment to strange world they have created.So, in the end, this is not a story about a rat who likes to cook, it becomes the moral that anyone can try something new. AND - there are no dumb Randy Newman songs. The pacing is quick, there are a few good action scenes, and humour exists, but mostly forced. This is still more of an adult orient animated film (there is a love story), but the rat is cute and the unorthodox premise never bores. As uncertain to the reaction when the film opened, there is a solid timeless quality to the execution that will make it a classic. Something that could not be said about last year's ""Cars"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Real charm popping out of a seemingly ho-hum situation.,"I remember the first time I ever saw a teaser for this movie. I thought it looked silly and I had to wonder just what Pixar and Disney were thinking. A rat wanting to get fancy Frency food. Please.But time went by, and cuter trailers appeared, and I found myself wanting to see the movie about the cute rat in the restaurant. So it came out and I had a free weekend.This is one of those movies where you spend the whole time thinking ""This is so good!"" while at the same time barely having enough time to think so as you are so caught up in the story and the stellar animation. It's subtle, heartfelt, and downright hilarious with a character-driven plot and so many themes I can't possibly count them all.Remy is a rat not altogether satisfied with his garbage-eating existence in the French countryside. He was born with an extreme sense of smell, which makes him useful to his colony when it comes to sniffing out rat poison--one of the many reasons his fellow rats despise humans. But Remy is fascinated by humans and their ability to create things, and eventually his interest leads him into the world of cooking when his nose becomes handy in blending flavors. A tragedy leads him to Paris, more specifically Gusteau's, the fallen-from-grace restaurant that had once belonged to the deceased chef Remy admired. Here he meets Linguini, an awkward young man who can't cook, and they figure they can help each other out.Do not be misled--this is far from being the only part of this incredible story. Rather there is a series of incidents created by a colorful cast of characters that leads us not only from movie's beginning to end but through some amazing character development and more plot events; it's infinitely better than contrived and forced plots that are so often shoved down our throats. This has many stories: the aforementioned, Remy's division between the worlds of rats and humans, an adorable love story between Linguini and a driven cook by the name of Collette, and that of Skinner, the new head chef determined to keep the restaurant under his own power. While we all love an intense character, ""Ratatouille"" keeps its players surprisingly realistic and subtle rather than making them into a circus of stereotypes. Admittedly, disbelief must be suspended in certain parts, but the story is so endearing and good that you are certainly willing to do so.The complexity of so many things is what make this film stand out. As Remy is torn between the worlds of humans and rats he is faced with the contradiction of what he is: a rat wanting to cook, but stealing food at the same time. Also there is the problem of Remy wanting credit, but neither wanting to lose his place in the world of gourmet. You must also notice the range between the fanciful talking rats and the realistic problems of wills and DNA testing. It works.I know I said I could not name the many themes circulating through this movie, but I must go at one. The title ""Ratatouille"" is not only a pun referring to the rodent characters, but is also a peasant dish never to be served at a fancy French restaurant. It's low, it's common, but as the movie shows can be more than any other food. This is a story about finding greatness in the ordinary.I feel this is one of Pixar's finest. It is a film that will stay with you long after it has finished.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"In the end, its just a rat movie.","I really wanted to love this movie. I read reviews that said things like, ""funniest Pixar movie ever!""

I didn't hate it, just wished it was a better movie. I found myself checking my watch several times throughout the movie - not a good sign.I think part of the problem is that too often the rats look too much like... well, RATS!

I would start to get caught up in the story and then all of a sudden a horde of rats would come on the screen and I'd think, ""GROSS!""The movie is gorgeous to look at - Pixar does their homework on the way things look and move.

Way overpraised ...,"What is it with the excessive overpraise for movies under the Pixar banner? I'll admit the company reinvigorated interest in animated movies a decade ago with photo-realistic visuals, clever characters, witty scenarios, and decent stories. Little of that was evident in RATATOUILLE. This movie was stale, uninspired, overlong and lacking in creativity.Everyone knows the premise by now: a rat works undercover as a chef in a fancy restaurant to prove that ""anyone"" can be a great chef if they want to. We know this theme because it is repeated ad nauseum to stretch out a movie that has nothing else to offer. That is not the only idea that is repeated over and over again. Cooking scenes, the rat being hunted and chased by the head chef, the love/hate dynamics between the two ""human"" leads, all make you wonder when we'll see anything new before the movie ends. We don't; the story just limps to its foregone conclusion.About the animation: Done in CGI hyper-realism, it elicits a ""wow, that bubbling pot looks just like a photo"" admiration that lasts about 5 minutes. By contrast, the end credits are accompanied by '60's-style Disney animation, and it is much more interesting.

Anyone can cook,Anyone can make a film but only a few can be great.Ratatouille in my humble opinion is one of if not the best of pixar who I have a high bar for making some of my favorite films period.

So he befriends a human named linguini who works at gusteau's restaurant as a garbage boy and they slowly but surly work out a way to make this odd partnership work.

Incomprehensible CGI with about 2 seconds of something funny.,"I went to see this yesterday, there are a lot of positives about this film but there is also just as many negatives.I don't know if i can clearly sum up my impression of Ratatouille because what can you really say that's not already been said.Alright, first the positives.1. Pixar really go all out into making you believe that these are actual rats, this includes giving you a glimpse of how rats are treated, how they live etc. After the film is over i left thinking that the only reason we fear rats is because of what we've turned them into. We treat them with less respect than pigeons.2. You will not see CGI this incomprehensible anywhere else and at least not for a while, try not to blink too much because you might miss something you wont ever see again.3. Most of the emotion appeared heartfelt and it was backed up by amazing dialogue which was also another good point, the dialogue is wonderful.4. In films such as this you'd expect there to be at least one stereotype in the movie and surprisingly there wasn't, or at least there weren't any that were made obvious.5. The critique stole the movie, delightfully wicked, and his monologue is something i haven't seen in ages.alright and now for the bad points.1. I didn't expect this film to be that funny, and it wasn't, you'd have to be a paid critique to find it funny (And i deeply stress the word PAID!), there is no comedy in this movie and i don't think there was really supposed to be, i don't think Brad Bird wrote it to be a comedy there were just an occasional gag in it and the newspapers did the rest.2. I groaned a couple of times, towards the end the film severely starts to drag, the film is a little boring throughout since it lacks comedy and got a bit typical with the plot but towards the last half hour, it really got boring.3. This film was very realistic but some things were just put in there to make the writers jobs easier, like the rats didn't speak human but they did understand English, and Remy knew what all the different types of cheeses and spices were although he was just a rat, one thing that killed it for me is when his dad says ""And thank GOD!"" i'm sorry but why do all the animals in CGI's have a concept of religion.And how did they manage to tie up the health inspector and the former chef.i know it's for kids but it doesn't hurt to be a little more true to life.4. There seems to be a pattern weaving where it doesn't matter where the movie is set or what accent you give the main characters and you can judge what accent a character will be given depending on which company made the movie.therubixtheory@hotmail.co.uk if anyone has anything they wish to yell at me for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Should be an Easy BEST PICTURE nominee,"I'm going to keep this short. Back in 1991 the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences broke new ground by nominating Disney's Beauty and the Beast for Best Picture of the year. Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite animated films of all time.Later to get around not having to nominate Animated movies in the Best Picture category; the academy drew up the Best Animated Picture Category. And that's great, because it allows them to spotlight the great Animated Pictures of the year.Still, just as movies that are nominated for Best Foreign Film are also eligible for Best Picture nominations; I see no reason that Ratatouille would not be running in both categories at next years awards.It's that good! No, I'm not going to say it's that good; I'm going to say it's better than that. It is the best movie I have seen this year, it may be the best movie I will see all year. It not only pulls at your heart strings and makes your eyes bulge out in absolute wonder. It also has one of the best crafted stories I have seen in a long time.Why does Hollywood always forget the importance of a great story and a well crafted screenplay? I think they do it on purpose, so when movies like this come out, you wonder ""So this is what good story telling is!"" The writing in this film is so good, I want to give it the Oscar, The Tony, The Pulitzer Prize and all other writing awards it is completely ineligible for, just because the movie is a reminder of what all movies could be, given the proper time to have the tightest story, and best screenplay possible.I'm definitely going to see it again, I'm going to tell everyone I know to go see, and honestly, I can't wait till the DVD comes out, and best of all...

Pleasing but WAY overrated,"With all the raves around this picture it's next to impossible not to have high expectations. Lower them. Unless you are entirely bowled over by visuals alone (which are truly stunning), you will be left wondering what all the fuss is about. This may be a movie about fine cuisine, but the story seems to have been concocted in a Cuisinart--it's a mash-up. Instead of a clear character objective or a distinct plot through-line, the filmmakers have tossed in every possible character type, sub-plot, and chase sequence, with the cumulative effect of holding your attention (for the most part), but leaving you ultimately unfulfilled. It's not that these sequences aren't artfully done (the technique is flawless), but they amount to an obfuscation of the fact that there's not much here but numerous pastry-thin layers of small vignettes (even at that, the filmmakers seem to have missed a lot of opportunities here, especially comic ones). There are also serious problems with suspension of disbelief. This may sound odd considering that this is an animated world, but such worlds hinge on their ability to establish their own parameters of reality. For reasons I cannot quite fathom, Ratatouille goes out of its way to set very specific and highly-realistic parameters, and then proceeds break them. You find yourself literally rationalizing certain plot developments with a conscious determination such as, ""well, it is, after all, a cartoon."" Great films may indeed be like great meals, but flavor alone doesn't satisfy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Third Best Pixar Movie,"I may get some flak for this, but here goes. I ranked Ratatouille third best ever in Pixar movies. It may be because I'm older, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good movie. The voices are good, the animation is stellar like all Pixar movies, and the jokes appeal to me. But it doesn't have the hilarious supporting actor/voice, like in Finding Nemo with Dory (my absolute favourite Pixar movie ever), and The Incredibles (E). Emile and Linguini just don't have that funny flair like Dory and E did. In Finding Nemo and The Incredibles, I found myself saying memorable quotes a lot (Dory speaking whale and E showing Helen the new suits). Ratatouille had me with none of these, except for the one from the trailer (Don't just hork it down!). Overall, 8/10.

Ratatouille. Adorable little film. A Fine Cut about the latest animated tripe.,"Ratatouille - A young adorable looking rat Remy (Patton Oswalt) has dreams of being a chef in Paris and teams up Cyrano-style with a sheepish no-talent named Linguini (Lou Romano) to cook and restore glory to a formerly 5-star restaurant (booted down to 3. Ouch.) Animated films are getting hard to judge and harder to sit through these days. As the quality of animation gets higher, the pool of ideas gets lower. it seems we have more and more talking penguins, fish, and Shrek rip-offs (Heck, from what I've heard, Shrek3 was a Shrek rip-off). Ratatouille succeeds in bringing something new to the table. Brad Bird directs, so like The Incredibles, this one is more for the adults than the kids (Suprising as it is G rated) but that shouldn't be a bad thing. It's still talking rats and there are many well constructed prat-falls to hold their interest.The movie was not as funny as I had hoped, though it still is genuinely funny at times, but what held me was how much the film sucked me in and had me really caring about the characters. I barely worried about the logistics of a rat being able to read and cook and control Linguini from under his chef's hat. The graphics, when I noticed, were breathtaking. The food and the ""tasting"" animation looks wonderful.There is a great voice cast as well. Remy is well animated and I just love that little guy. Patton Oswalt did a great job. Lou Romano managed to convey awkward yet well-meaning in a way that borrowed a little from Jon Heder. He has some great scenes with Janeane Garofolo who plays hard-edged Collete. Peter O' Toole has a wonderful bit as the creepy critic (animation style straight out of Tim Burton) Anton Ego.I was happy that there weren't that many digs at the French. There still are, and I'm a touch disappointed that both the leads speak in completely neutral American accents, but test audiences have to be pleased I'm sure. Ian Holm is nearly undetectable as the villainous super-stereotypical French head chef Skinner.I like that Remy the Rat can't talk to any of the humans including Linguini, something that always bugged me in most of the other animated movies involving animals or people talking in different languages (most irritatingly Pocahontas). It's of little consequence to the review but it's a little personal preference note. Ebert includes those so why can't I?The film meanders a little between the second and third acts but the conclusion is adorable and hilarious. I love the little touches to the animation and the story. This film was clearly a labor of love, not profit, though it'll acquire a lot of both to be sure.

"Takes twice the time it should, not what you'd expect from Pixar.","This could have been a great film, it was just too long. It wasn't even that there were too many scenes that should have been left out, it was simply that scenes went for too long. Montages, too long. Travel scenes, too long. Even some of the conversations seemed to be the same conversation from the start of the film. The story could have been cut to barely an hour would have improved the flow substantially.The concept was brilliant, many of the jokes and fun moments were great, the story itself very good and the animation as always was superb.It was just too slow moving, story felt like it lurched forward with a Frankenstein like gait, determined but not pretty. Unusually the characters weren't terribly endearing, for Pixar even the villains are usually a little likable. In this even the lead characters were nothing special, there wasn't really any character development apart from the one or two that were essential dictated by the plot.The kids in the cinema seemed somewhat entertained, I'm glad I saw it. But it's a one time viewing film that could have gone straight to DVD.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
entertaining,"Not much to add to so many comments already.I would say this movie is entertaining. Fans of CGI should certainly go see it, the animation is superb. The story is a bit far-fetched but that's the beauty of animation movies isn't it? And the way it all unfolds is certainly a bit cheesy (beg your pardon). But all in all an enjoyable experience.When comparing with the other 'rats' animation flick I saw recently, 'Flushed Away', I would have to say that one did more for me. Way funnier than this one.Also, I am not sure what the intended audience is here. It will certainly be hard for kids to understand what the French characters are saying. And the romance thing going on, there is no setup to it, it just happens. From an adult point of view I can understand how you might want to snog a saucy french cook, but I found it a bit sexually loaded. Don't think kids will get it, and from a storyline point of view, it didn't add much to the story.One final question: do rats in France really have such a heavy American accent? I never noticed it and I've been to Paris several times...",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Magnificent!,"This is a true masterpiece. I truly enjoyed it along with my 5 year old son. Although at times the story was perhaps too complex for him he still enjoyed the movie and the story being more complex than usual made it very enjoyable for me too. The movie is a story of passion and love (for food mostly, but there is a small on-screen romance too...). Another masterpiece from Pixar who have proved that they can make technically fantastic movies (good animation) that also have a deep story within (this is in the line of, e.g., Cars). The good thing is that lately Pixar is departing of the tradition of Disney where one of the parents of the main character dies in some tragic way (from the mother of Bambi to the mother of Nemo), although there is one death in the movie...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Splendid Meal,"Remy is a rat, constantly risking life in an expensive French restaurant because of his love of good food, as well as a desire to become a chef. Yet, obviously, this is a rather tough dream for a rat. But opportunity knocks when a young boy, who desperately needs to keep his job at the restaurant, despite his lack of cooking abilities, discovers and partners the young Remy. Its up to the two of them to avoid the insane head chef, bring the rest of Remy's family up to his standards, win his partner a girl, and, of course, produce the finest Ratatouille in all of France.Last year's Pixar movie, ""Cars"", was really underwhelming, although still generic. This put Pixar back on its tracks. Not just with the seamless, not to mention wonderful, animation, imagination, but with the unique storyline.Every speck of scene is done with great detail (of course with a budget of $150 million!). The vivid colors and all turns this into a visual masterpiece! Yet, the movie (for a whole) wasn't perfect. It fell just beneath my expectations.Maybe I expected more than the unusual. Although with a weird plot, it didn't go anywhere in the movie until the last twenty minutes in the film, not to mention some choppy pacing. Also, this movie is more for adults and teens than for kids, probably why it didn't make as much money than most Pixar films.Still, in the end, Ratatouille is a fantastic animated feature, worthy in the Pixar franchise. It's funny and it's a visual delight. Although it doesn't make a perfect meal, it's still fantastic to eat.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Very Rich Colors Are Fantastic; Mouse Is Great; Humans Not So,"I agree this Blu-Ray transfer is stunning, magnificent to view in many spots with very, very rich colors.

Only the mouse was likable enough for me. The humans were all too annoying to enjoy the film.These other characters were either too loud, obnoxious, nasty or irritating including the kid whom the rat helped!

Instant Classic,"I actually just got back from this movie and just had to give my opinion. Me and my friends went into the movie expecting nothing more than a few kicks and giggles. This movie, on the other hand, exceeded every one of our expectations. It already became my favorite Pixar and thats competing with monsters inc., toy story, and other greats. The animation was great! Also the music was perfect to fit this French themed movie. The voices they used were absolutely perfect for their characters and I loved the inspiring and creative story line that played through the entire movie.

Pixar Does It Again,"The reviews (press, websites) were overwhelmingly positive, so I actually went in expecting it to betray my heightened expectations. Boy, was I wrong! First, the visuals: perfect. Definitely Pixar's best work yet in this department, hands down. Everything is warm, soft, very realistic yet painterly. Animation is topnotch, special effects like liquids are natural, and the ever-so-important fur was realistic. Colors were rich and deep; makes me wish that the world was that pretty.The sound was great, not one thing stood out as imperfect. The voice actors breathed life into the digital dolls and no voice actor sounded forced or unfitting for the character.The story was enjoyable, with many hilarious bits scattered throughout the otherwise heartwarming script. The main themes were not entirely original (being different, overcoming differences), but this was perhaps the most enjoyable presentation I've yet to come across.The film left me feeling very satisfied, a smile stretching from ear to ear. The story did seem to wind down at points, but the ending was very fitting and had me cheering the lovable characters. I was more than impressed (even with my high expectations), and might even consider this as the best Pixar film yet.Definitely a must-see; bring your family (or a date)!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Disney Pixar Masterpiece!!!!!

My oh my, I was so wrong. This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.Everything in this movie is brilliant..well,sometimes somewhere, but it doesn't matter because this movie really has touched my heart.Brad Bird, the Oscar winning director has proved himself again.So, all I can say at last is ""Ratatouille"" is one of the best animated movie ever made and movies like this aren't made that often.Take your family with you to the theater and enjoy it rather than waiting for a DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Phenomenal,"This is an interesting film for a subject. First off, its a Brad Bird film, which is hard to compete with. Secondly, it's a Pixar flick. Third, it's rated G! How many films this year so far have this rating that all genres actually can find positive comments about? The crew that produced this is enormous. The money that went into this would probably is phenomenal (but I can't find a price on the total yet). Disney and Pixar know a cash cow when they see one.However, something strange happened to me during my first viewing of this film: I found myself detached from it in some strange way. The color work was excellent, the texture and feel was superior, the characterization impeccable. So what was it? The movie works on all levels, but there is a subjective aspect that I think interferres with the total immersion in this instance: 1. Not many people have an affinity for wild rats (except Willard), and 2. A geek (with an American dialect) that ends up being a totally incompetent heir of a famous French chef. Sometimes it felt like Brad was attempting to fit a square peg into a round hole.Not that its a bad thing, this is definitely a treat for all ages. The plot is simple: Sewer rat with his higher olfactory abilities applies it to garnishing food to achieve top honors with local critics. The pace doesn't leave you wanting; the continuity doesn't leave you wondering; the beauty of the animation doesn't leave you skeptical. Really, I can't recommend this enough for anyone with or without a family. I just can't put my finger on it though... it just leaves me curious.Another thing... I alway like to comment on the audience reaction to it in the viewing audience: Even with all the kids, they were engaged and didn't squawk throughout the movie, but also there was a lack of genuine surprise or laughter at the more poignant comic events, which makes me feel I'm not alone in my thinking here.

simply fabulous,"Ratatouille redefines the art of movie making in this era of high fidelity technology. It is focused on the story and its characters unlike many other movies which proves nothing more than the fact that sound and picture quality are better these days. Beautifully portrayed and needless to say, flawless voice acting, ratatouille will be a landmark, not just in animation movies but also in the movie history. Take out the amazing graphics and animated characters out of it and still it will amaze you in many ways.

an animated film with a good story,"This was one of the better animated films of the past several years. Both adults and kids would like it. Remy the rat gets separated from his colony and ends up at restaurant Gusteau. Remy is no ordinary rat. He loves to cook and is excellent at it. A new employee there, Linguini, sees Remy added herbs to the soup and to his surprise and all the other cooks, it is very good. No one else notices Remy though, so Linguini gets all the credit. Only problem is Linguini really can't cook. The owner, Skinner, discovers that Linguini is really Gusteau's long lost son. That means Linguini could still inherit the restaurant. Customers begin asking for Linguini's special dishes, which are created by Remy. They strike up a partnership. Remy controls Linguini's arms with his hair. I know, that sounds really weird. Any way, its up to them to impress the harshest food critic of all and to find out about Linguini's father. Plus, Remy finds his family again, but can he leave the restaurant business behind for them.FINAL VERDICT: Very entertaining story with great animation.

First, it was special and there were only a few. Now, a new one seems to come every week and the stories are all so similar. Ratatouille though, was very original.

Technical perfection completely out of place.,"Let me get right to the point, i think this is one of the worst animation movies i've ever seen. Why do American movie makers think that things in Europe work like they do in the US. The theme is French, the people are too, it plays in a restaurant in Paris. Yet it has not even the remotest European charm due to typical American moralism and blandness. So i wasn't even surprised that everybody is speaking with an Italian accent, behave like they in a sort of mafia movie an orders get screamed around like in some kind of cheap American diner. This movie is technical perfection, but does not go any further then the outside of nice graphics. It does strike me that the voice acting of the linguini caracterer is completely out of place and not suitable. A comparison to flushed away needs to be made, cause of the European rat theme, but there's really no need, flushed away is funny, very smart, intellectual and for all ages, where ratatouille is probably only for children, and boring, stupid and way over the top for adults. O yeah the story........there isn't any, apart from a vague cliché. The botomline is that i left after watching this rubbish after 45 minutes.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
This movie is just plain fun,"I enjoyed every moment of it and will definitely buy it when it comes out on DVD.I don't buy many movies, so that's a huge compliment. I love Pixar!!! None of their movies have ever disappointed me. And what I love about them is that they are great, sincere, real family movies. They aren't horribly cheesy or anything and are just great fun to watch.Ratatouille is a mini-masterpiece and anyone from 1 to 100 will enjoy it. The plot is very well constructed and even every character is enjoyable to watch. My favorite one is probably the Linguine guy. He is very funny and realistic at the same time. I am sure many people can relate to him. I will reiterate that I loved this movie and will be glad to see it again and again!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It's great to take kids to the movies again!,"This is the type of film that makes adults feel thankful for the fact that they have to take their kids to the movies! I have watched the film with my three kids and when it was over, it was impossible to say who had enjoyed the film more. Apart from the technical aspects, which seem remarkable to me (although I'm no expert in the area), I found the plot and the characters absolutely delicious. They are funny, they are human, they have an enormous sense of humor. We don't have the typical animated story where animals and people speak the same language, but instead we see that different worlds, different languages can come together and find some sort of understanding. Besides they managed to make rats interesting, even attractive. I do hope more films like this one will come up!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The Best CGI Animated Film Ever Created,"As everyone knows, Pixar set the industry standard for CGI feature films when it released the groundbreaking ""Toy Story"" in 1995. In hindsight, it's quite astonishing how high they managed to set the bar for all such future films. There have been other commercial successes that have come close to matching the irrefutable charm and appeal of ""Toy Story""  ""Finding Nemo"", ""Shrek"", ""The Incredibles""  but, however formidable these films proved to be, it's hard to beat a true original.But it's not impossible. If you liked any of the above-mentioned films, you'll absolutely love Pixar's latest masterwork, ""Ratatouille"". If you saw a couple of CGI films that were real stinkers and gave up on the genre, give this one a try. It is guaranteed to refocus the entirety of your misconceptions.""Ratatouille"" is about, well, a rat  Remy (Patton Oswalt)  whose ambitious culinary aspirations challenge the rat world's status quo, it being that rats are meant to live in fear of humans, make their homes underground, and sustain themselves on garbage. After being separated from his family and friends, Remy happens upon an unusual opportunity to scratch his itch. He teams up with a hapless, incompetent, aspiring chef, Linguini (Lou Romano), through whom he discovers a way to create dishes with a clever, complex hair-pulling control system underneath Linguini's chef hat  a very fascinating mutualistic symbiosis wherein Linguini appears to be a top-notch French chef and Remy gets to live out his lifelong dream.Writer and Director Brad Bird (""The Incredibles"", ""Iron Giant"") removes any doubt as to his ability to tell his stories through strong character-driven, detail-oriented tapestries that venture well beyond what one might expect from an animated children's story. Through subtlety, he infuses the story with charm and heart, such as when Remy, when asked by Linguini whether or not he can cook, responds by shrugging his shoulders sheepishly yet conceitedly  a simple but nonetheless telling gesture. Bird's fantastic script is executed brilliantly by a talented array of actors who all give strong performances.""Ratatouille"" has a very particular and appealing sly, refined sense of humor delivered admirably through the use of heavy slapstick and expression. It's a fish-out-of-water tale to be sure sure, but a delightfully original and entertaining one, and certainly not one to be defined by only one such constraining designation. The story's heart and soul stem from the facing of new challenges  looking beyond one's own horizon and gathering the courage to pursue new things. It's concrete proof that a kids' flick can be accessible to its target audience while also being cerebral and unpredictable. My main qualm with the preceding animated feature  ""Surf's Up""  was that despite nice visuals and great voice acting, there was little originality in the storyline. That is, it lacked unpredictability and there were more than the acceptable amount of kids'-movie clichés, whereas ""Ratatouille"" noticeably lacks such clichés as, for example, weird, accessory-sidekicks or just-a-little-too-perfect protagonists. Flawless protagonists are one-dimensional for the most part, and it's difficult to ignore such blatant disregard for the storytelling process while watching such a character carry on. Remy, in contrast, is cute and likable, sure; but at times he is also, among other things, abrasive, apprehensive, and retributive  attributes that in and of themselves give depth to his personality and contribute to the vitality of his character.There's always at least one movie that really sticks in kids' minds throughout their lives. ""The Lion King"", ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Cinderella"", or ""Toy Story"" are all clear possibilities, of course. In this, the age of budget-busting CGI fests, gore movies, and monotonous kids' flicks, it's more than a genuine treat when a picture like ""Ratatouille"" hits the big screen. A charmer for all ages, it's a one-of-a-kind, can't miss experience. Pixar has finally  *finally*  outdone themselves with this one. ""Ratatouille"" has set a new standard for family-oriented CGI romp movies and kid-based storytelling.It is rare for a reviewer to endow an animated feature with the word ""masterpiece"". The last time that description rolled off my tongue and into a review, I had just finished watching the wonderful ""Pan's Labyrinth"". No animated movie I've ever seen has deserved such a prominent title. Until now, that is. It's not really that shocking when you think about it. Truly fine art deserves the highest recognition, and this reviewer encourages you to go and see why ""Ratatouille"" is the best CGI animated film ever made.Grade: 6/6 (""Transcendent"")",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar just keeps getting better & better!,"This movie was incredible!!! The animation was so lush and beautiful it almost felt real. The acting was stellar across the board.

Wonderful mindless fun - awfully good mindFUL fun,"RATATOUILLE, the latest deservedly successful Pixar entry in the animation sweepstakes is effortlessly the best summer movie for families who want an outing that won't insult the kids and won't go over the heads of the adults. It really does have all the elements for cross-over cartoon success: cute fuzzy characters, front loaded (but ""comic"" - no gore and no one dies despite many shotgun blasts and talk of poison) violence, physical discomfort (as the ""little chef"" and his human counterpart work out their communication system), sexless romance (the human and the girlfriend he's desperate to impress) and a comic villain who the fuzzy character can defeat repeatedly in beautifully plotted farce choreography.The capper, of course, is that the film also wants to be an allegory on people being judged on their ABILITIES rather than their appearances, being *honest* about those abilities (the fuzzy little guy is a great natural and self-trained cook, the human is neither) and the importance of TEAMWORK (the real trouble comes when egos get in the way). So far so good.Unfortunately, it also has a massive caveat to the allegory and the enjoyment (knocking two points off the rating for me): rats in the kitchen. Well, um, yes, that will give some people pause if they actually think about what they are seeing (adults are inclined to do that). Rats are legally verboten in most places of food preparation - and it has nothing to do with anything that is their fault. They ARE cute and fuzzy, but they also may carry ticks and fleas which frequently carry disease. Living in less than cleanly places, they walk through places and things with high bacterial counts. Unhealthy.The film is brave enough to realize they have to address this little problem - the baggage more sophisticated viewers who are flocking to Pixar's best work WILL being in with them - and so the film backs their comic villain (his initial defeat over ""the will"" is far to quick and ""tossed off"" to be as satisfying as it should be) with a restaurant health inspector who is comically dealt with temporarily, but since the authors couldn't actually kill him off or believably convert him, they were stuck for a predictably happy ending.In a plot twist which young audiences will have to really scramble to follow (actually they may not care, but their parents who will have to explain it to them if they do will need to pay attention) they settle for a wise, if slightly melancholy one.Does it matter? Not as much as you might think, but it does keep what comes very close to being a classic from true greatness and leaves the rightly enthusiastic audiences with just a very, very good film. Don't miss it - there is so much clever execution to revel in - but be prepared NOT to check your mind at the door. This is a film which might be more fun if you could, but will leave you with much more to think about when you don't, even if it undercuts the allegory and some of the fun. That in itself can be very satisfying.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Rats and Men,"In formal and technical terms this movie is undoubtedly very good but not better than the average recent other computer animated movies. Its main original feature is the story itself which tells us about the rat that wants to be a chef and attains its aim after a lot of exciting vicissitudes.

But here we sympathize with them indeed.

"It wasn't crap, but it wasn't brilliant.","A fairly likable film, but I feel that Ratatouille is undeserving of the high praise heaped upon it. Number 129 in the IMDb Top 250? Are you kidding me? Above Toy Story 2? Above Finding Nemo? Above The Incredibles (arguably the finest animated movie ever)? And, I'm not the world's biggest fan of it, but above The Lion King?The only area that Ratatouille is superior to any of the afore-mentioned films is the excellent, realistic animation and the innovative 'action' sequences. Character development? Minimal. Laugh-out-loud moments? Reserved for the last twenty minutes...the biggest redeeming feature of the film (well done Mr O'Toole). Silly plot twists? Check. Overkill of a premise? Check. Speaking English with newspapers in French? Check. Overdone physical 'comedy'? Check. Pointless violence? Check.I think a little more time needed to be spent on the script and not how well it was presented. I didn't feel much of a connection to any of the characters, and did not become emotionally involved with Remy until the end of the film.However, this isn't a BAD film, it's just disappointing. Brad Bird's Incredibles saga was a hugely engaging, entertaining and funny film, and this is not. I know a lot of people may disagree with me (129th??), but I felt this fell way short of the bar. Bring on The Incredibles 2 and let's give thanks that Hayao Miyazaki is still churning them out.

If you are looking for a movie for the whole family to watch, this is the movie you are looking for. Its heartwarming, and its a good laugh even for adults. The animation was outstanding, and the characters really come to life and touch your heart. After seeing this movie, you will think of rats and cooking in a whole new way.

2nd Best Pixar movie of all time!,"I saw this movie with some reservations, I was like ""its a kids movie. I'm 19 yrs old"". But you know what, I was sorely mistaken. It's not just a kids movie.Pixar does an amazing job with this movie, it's up with the original Toy Story. The character are entertaining and easy to relate to. Everyone can relate to wanting to do something and having someone tell you that you can't do it; everyone can relate to just wanting that one shot. Ultimately that is all Remy and Linguini want. The characters are also well flawed, Remy's desire to be a great chef almost gets in the way of his family and friends. Linguini has to lie to protect Remy.This movie was more than I was expecting.

RATATOUILLE est magnifique,"The best comedies are not the funniest; the best songs are not the most melodic; the best actresses are not the prettiest.I bring this up because there seems to be a criticism that RATATOUILLE is not the funniest movie Pixar has put out. It does, however, have the biggest heart (not the ""aw"" factor like ""Isn't that cute?"", but in the truly moving moments that connect to something deep, deep down inside us all).For anyone to find a talent, a passion, and to be able to pursue it without having to hold back -- that is achievement at the highest, most godly manner, as if he or she has connected to God intimately because he or she has found his or her true calling and happily gives his or her life to it. We all dream of finding our purpose in life, and dedicating our lives completely to it...but it is rare that we do -- rare that we find it, rare that we pursue it, rare that we dedicate our lives to it. And for someone to be denied that chance -- not because of lack of talent or passion, but by being told ""you can't"" (for any reason) -- is among the saddest things in the world. It hardly makes life worth living. THIS is the real story of RATATOUILLE.(Confession: I am a 45 year-old guy who shed a couple of well-deserved tears at this film.

Welles cooking!,"This is very good work. Pixar is by now a solid bet, and they have brilliant minds who are working their ways in new cinematic adventures. Here is another.The principle of the thing is a being (mouse) who is able to control another being (human) and thus create his art (gastronomy). This is announced before the beginning of the film with the short ""Lifted"", i commented on it and there placed my view on the subject.The way the story develops is fully Disney anchored, some bad people, lots of great beings, some trouble in the middle and a happy ending. We're used to it.The reason why this is adventurous is because of the movement and placement of the virtual camera. This is really well done. I suspect the reason why a mouse was chosen was because being such a small animal, which at the same time can move around easily, it was perfect for being climbing up shelves, going inside walls with rusty pipes, being on the floor looking up, being inside a cooker's hat (and there you get the transparency of that hat, another theme to work visually) and moving quickly between all those places. So they have that point of view, the one of the mouse, and layered on that, they shift constantly and go to the point of view of the humans around, other animals. This is very well paced, of course, and the editing is superb. The camera works as Welles might have done it, it understands virtual space, and explores it.This is much much better in these concerns than ""finding Nemo"" (which was sort of a disappointment to me) and i suspect i know why. There we had an immense space (the ocean) which we were free to explore. But that wasn't well done there probably because there were lacking physical references, objects that could stay still while the characters were moving around (great work exploring the possibilities of deep space is the one Besson does, while filming directly the ocean in Atlantis but also in practically the rest of his work).My evaluation: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"It's a good movie, but not great","I saw the movie last night.Honestly, the animation itself was probably the best of the Pixar bunch, but the storyline is probably one of the weakest.Without spoiling anything, I would say movies like Toy Story or Monster's Inc or even Nemo all had a ""aha"" moment for me where you feel something be in inspiration or whatever.With this movie though, it was just cute...it really didn't have anything to ""say"" like the other one.Also, another thing that was disappointing was that in the credits, there weren't any cute outtakes like the other one.I enjoyed it, but it didn't live up to my expectation of Pixar.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Rat in mi kitchen,"Ratatouille had a troubled history despite Brad Bird getting the screenwriter and director credit as well as taking the Best Oscar for Animation. The original director was (Czech born) British Oscar winning animator Jan Pinkava who only now gets a story co-credit for this this film. His vision apparently needed to be Pixar-fied.Yet underlying this movie is Pinkava's vision, when the story gets boring and predictable I see Hollywood at play as the film gets derivative, you know joining the dots from A-Z.Maybe the dirty smelly scavenging rats represent humans with Remy being the most well read and cultured example. Remy does not want to go through rubbish every night he wants to cook and is inspired after taking legendary chef, the late Auguste Gusteau's cookbook, 'Anyone Can Cook.'Remy rises from the sewers of Paris to Gusteau's restaurant where he sees Gusteau's ghost or is it a figment of the rat's imagination? The restaurant is now run by head chef Skinner who believes in the commercialisation of Gusteau's name.Remy hides under the hat of the incompetent, bumbling Linguini new to the kitchen and shows him how to cook by pulling his curly hair, fellow chef Collete teaches him the basic but it is Remy who provides the inspiration that wows the customers and arouses the interest of renowned and intimidating food critic Anton Ego who took one of the stars away from Gusteau. Skinner is also suspicious of Linguini's skills, in fact he smells a rat.This is a breezy film, with rats in the kitchen cooking the food rather than taking it away although we do see that as well. The love angle is boring and predictable as are the few obligatory chase scenes in the streets and river of Paris. Yet I could not help wondering how Pinkava's film would had turned out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
This is one talented rat!,"Pixar (The Toy Story people, for you cave dwellers out there) has scored another animation hit with this uneven, but still enjoyable feature about a rat who dreams of becoming a chef. Well, safe to say that we have an original idea there. The animation is, of course, superb, regardless of whether we are watching a surging storm drain, precise human hand dexterity or the Paris cityscape. There are several sub-plots going on and a little more focus would have been of some help here. There are also several overly long scenes of rats scurrying away from dangers that get a little wearisome, but a fairly charming story does emerge soon enough.This movie surprised me with a funny, little, seven-minute short feature, called Lifted, which was about an inept alien screwing up an apparent human abduction test. This was a nice start and lead up to the main feature, in which Patton Oswalt reads the part of Remi, a very bright rat, who is also gifted with a very powerful sense of smell. This prevents him from enjoying the usual rat fare of, well, mainly garbage. Remi, who also knows how to read (this really is one talented rat!), learns about cooking from the book of the late, great, French Chef Gusteau. After escaping a shotgun swinging senior, as well as other dangers, Remi finds himself teaming up with a lowly, clean-up guy, Linguini (read by Lou Romano). With Remi's talent and Linguini's more acceptable kitchen presence, the two soon form a team that takes the French restaurant team by storm. Linguini finds love, while Remi finds a perfect soup, but there are complications aplenty, including evil Head Chef Skinner (well read by Ian Holm), who has an interest in seeing the young boy fail. Peter O'Toole, as well, does a great job reading the small, but important part of the feared restaurant critic, Anton Ego. The story, which takes a little time to get rolling, is quite warm and enjoyable, is capped off with, of course, a nice feel-good finish.Well, if nothing else, this film could be used as a recruiting tool for culinary school, but that shouldn't be necessary, since, besides glorifying the art of cooking, it should be enjoyed by all ages. I found issue with a very brief scene that showed a gun being used in anger in a domestic setting (besides our Shotgun Sally senior mentioned above). I found this scene to be completely out of place and inappropriate. I don't understand why it was included. Ratatouille also has few less giggles than I hope to see in a feature of this type, but does serve up a very heart-warming story with a tiny, side dish scene about critics (like me), who create nothing and only attack those who do create. On behalf of critics everywhere, I take issue with this completely unfair assessment of the critic's place in society! Let me just make a few points in our defense. First of all, I'd like to say....ummmwell; I guess I don't have any points to raise. It's pretty much true.(This ManhattanMovieManiac work was first featured on realmoviereview)",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Clever but Tiresome,"This is a clever movie, with lots of entertaining gags that fly by too fast to take them all in, but why must so many of these animated movies have the ""roots v. dreams"" theme. We saw it in Pinnochio and The Little Mermaid and Aladdin, and too many others to count; a protagonist who dreams of transcending his (or her, occasionally) place in the world, but has so many tiresome conflicted moments along the way.Also, would it have been so hard to have had a few more female characters? Let's see, we had the batty old lady with the shotgun and the tough but hot chef, and a brief glimpse of a female food critic. Why couldn't there have been some female rats, at least? Couldn't Remy have had a sister and mother instead of a father and brother? I think we need a Title IX for animated feature films!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Very Disappointed,"I had a decision to make. I had time to see one movie on Sunday. Either Ratatouille or Transformers. I was never a fan of the Transformers show when I was a kid. So I read various reviews on the two movies on non-IMDb websites to get a gist of both films. Unlike IMDb, both films were getting positive but not great reviews over all. Ratatouille had far more positive reviews than Transformers so I picked Ratatouille.Simply put, Ratatouille is just average at best. The animation was nothing spectacular. I guess the novelty of Computer animation is wearing off. It was pretty close it not the same as the old style cell animation.No matter what tricks or special effects a film uses, it doesn't mean anything unless the story is good. The story in Ratatouille was just average. It was cute in spots but tedious in other places. A lot of the supporting characters were played up only to be discarded quickly and the main villain had no setup at all. You only knew he was the bad guy because he had the standard bad guy sinister look - that was it.An animated feature film should have some truths inside it. It should touch on the real world with real emotions and Ratatouille missed it in a big way. Rats around food is just gross, even cartoon rats, especially if the animators spent months or years to get the look ""just right"". Maybe if it was dog trying to cook but a rat was just wrong.The best animated features are those that contain at least a nod to the adults in the audience who brought their children to the show. Remember in The Incredibles, the superhero family had real family issues to deal with. You could turn to an adult sitting next to you and say ""Ain't that the truth"" or there could be the inclusion of jokes that kids find funny but adults really find funny because they were directed at them. Ratatouille had none of this. In fact the film wasn't that funny.Brad Bird get credit for at least taking a chance with the characters and the plot but the execution missed for me. I was very disappointed.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar at the peak of their creativity!,"After the partial disappointment of Cars, which was good but not enough by Pixar standards, it is a joy to see the company return to form. In fact, Ratatouille could even be the best picture they have produced so far, beating The Incredibles, Nemo and even Toy Story.The film wasn't actually as heavily marketed as previous Pixar achievements, possibly because audiences, both young and adult, wouldn't really know what to think of this peculiar movie, which stars a rat. Yes, that's correct, a rat. The rodent's name is Remy (Patton Oswalt), and he is endowed with a particularly powerful nose, which allows him to tell what kinds of food are good or bad based on the smell. This has made him extremely picky when it comes to his diet, and during one of his culinary expeditions he is accidentally separated from his family. After traveling in the sewers for a while, he finds himself in the middle of Paris, the capital of excellent cooking. His joy is only temporary, though, as he discovers that his favorite restaurant (he has seen it on TV) has lost three of its five stars, the first because a nasty food critic named Anton Ego (Peter O' Toole) gave the place a more negative review than usual, the second because the leading chef, Gusteau (Brad Garrett), died of grief. Now the restaurant is in worse shape than ever, as new boss Skinner (Ian Holm) is simply interested in business and doesn't care about the food's quality. Fortunately, Remy, despite being a rat, has taken Gusteau's motto (""Anyone can cook"") to heart and, guided by the great chef's ghost, he tries to bring things back to normal, finding an ally in the clumsy but good-hearted Linguini (Lou Romano), through whom he manages to prepare one delicious dish after another, restoring the restaurant's reputation.The premise might sound far-fetched even for a Disney/Pixar movie, and yet Ratatouille has the best script made for an animated feature in ages: staying faithful to the company's belief that story and character come first, not celebrity voices and pop-culture references (as is the case with Dreamworks' cartoons), writer-director Brad Bird, the man behind The Incredibles), has crafted a screenplay of rare (for a 'toon, that is) sharpness and intelligence, consisting of an intriguing plot, smart gags (including one midway through the movie that should be inappropriate in a G-rated picture but somehow fits neatly into the pitch-perfect narrative) and, most of all, fully developed characters. Whereas most animated films focus on a limited group of people, Pixar has always been famous for giving everyone a moment in the spotlight, and it shows the most in this film: the bond between Remy and Linguini, which is every bit as solid and compelling as the ones between Woody and Buzz or Mike and Sully, is of course at the center of the picture's events, but the initially awkward, then tender relationship between the inept aspiring cook and his coworker Colette (Janeane Garofalo) is equally well built and moving; supporting characters such as Remy's brother and father, who are incapable of understanding his love for proper food, the mischievous Skinner or psychotic cook Horst (voiced by Will Arnett, best known for the hilarious, prematurely canceled Arrested Development), who always has a different explanation for why he used to be in prison (it ranges from ""I created a hole in the Ozone layer over Avignon"" to ""I killed a man... with this thumb!""), provide most of the situation's foolproof humor; as for Ego, to whom O' Toole lends one of the best voices ever to have been used in animation, he stands out as one of the best villains in animated film history (that the makers of such critically adored movies decided to use a critic as the bad guy is another stroke of genius).Also fundamental is the originality: apart from the obviously unusual pitch (rat turns out to be best chef in France), Ratatouille is a gold-mine of superb material from the splendid start to the exceptional ending, which revives Pixar's trademark surprise element that was missing in Cars. The real surprise, however, is the amount of stuff Bird comes up with in between: most movies, especially action flicks and comedies, run out of ideas at a certain point but keep going because otherwise the running time would be too short (this is evident in the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels which, albeit funny and exciting, were famously, and obviously, written as the shooting went on); in Ratatouille, whenever a joke has run its course it is immediately followed by one exactly as brilliant, thus making the film a seemingly never-ending flow of wit at its sharpest.Bottom line: after a a partial misfire, Pixar is, thankfully, back on track with the only film that is capable of rivaling The Simpsons Movie as the best animated feature of the year, and that is really saying something.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The single greatest animated movie to date.,"Finally an animated children's flick i enjoyed. The visual experience alone, makes up for a great time. Remy, the main character in the movie, has to be one off Pixars best animations. That being said, the entire movie is some of Pixars best work.Over the past few weeks, different movies have come and gone, from all the 'threequels' to the 3rd penguin related movie in 2 years, Ratatouille is by far my favorite.With a beautiful story, a tight plot, and incredible voice offers, the movies is a refreshment from Hollywood's incredible unoriginality in the past few years. I was particularly surprised by the joy and even amusement I received from watching this flick. More often then not, children's flicks, incorporate the typical fart joke and other assortments of toilet humor that children find oh so amusing for reasons unbeknownst. Ratatouille manages to stay amusing with out having to use fart jokes, but still uses humor that children can appreciate and enjoy. A happy ride all the way throughPart of the films originality comes from the wonderful use of animation to tell the story, from the various chasing scenes (you'll know them when you see them), to my favorite scene involving an incident with the health inspector, the movies animation takes you in and never lets go.An original, amusing and extremely well done animated children's film.

And if you don't have kids, watch it anyways, you'll definitely enjoy it.10/10 - go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
My Personal Favourite Pixar Film,"Envisioned, cooked, garnished & served by the finest talents working at Pixar Animation Studios, Ratatouille is a magical blend of imagination, creativity & craftsmanship that puts together its fresh ingredients with remarkable care & attention to detail, is flavoured with fine dose of wit & huge shot of inspiration which is then baked to near-perfection under its impeccable direction, deftly written screenplay & incredible set of rich characters, followed by its garnishing with state-of-the-art animation, expert use of colour palettes & enchanting score, and is finally presented to us customers in a perfectly refined fashion.Set in the locales of Paris, the story of Ratatouille concerns Remy; an ambitious rat who is gifted with a highly developed sense of taste n smell, is skilled in the art of cooking & wants to become a great chef one day. While his rodent appearance & human's aversion to rats already pose a fatal threat to his passion for cooking, new doors of possibilities are opened when a fateful event separates Remy from his family & takes him to the famous restaurant of his culinary hero where he tries to achieve his goal by forming an odd alliance with the restaurant's garbage boy which turns the culinary world upside down.Written, produced & directed by Brad Bird, Ratatouille marks yet another achievement for Pixar as this revolutionary studio continues to scale new heights with its flawless fusion of quality storytelling with breathtaking animation and of all the films they've dished out so far, this is my personal favourite. The precision with which each frame is rendered here speaks volumes about the extensive research that went into its production and whether it is the depiction of Parisian streets or French cuisines or culinary art or rodent lifestyle or passion n love for food, Ratatouille captures these tiniest of details with sublime delicacy.The 3D animation from Pixar has always been at the forefront of its genre & with this film, it further pushes that art form into new realms to raise the bar once again. The biggest proof that Pixar absolutely nailed it when it comes to capturing the essence of food & culinary art is present in the moments when we find ourselves salivating for what actually are animated cuisines. Add to that, the characters inhabiting this picture are very life-like & well-rounded with defined arcs plus its storyline risks failure by taking the road-less-travelled but once again manages to come out a winner in the end, just like every single Pixar film before it.While characters in almost all their films are brilliantly designed, wonderfully detailed & smoothly rendered on the screen, there is one more thing that plays a vital role behind its success but never really gets enough credit & that's the contribution of its voice-cast. Time n again, Pixar has come up with a fitting cast to voice its characters & with Ratatouille, the tradition continues for the French accent here is pretty much spot-on. And last but not the least, there's Michael Giacchino's beautiful, heartwarming & delightful score that turns this tale into an emotional roller-coaster ride with its wild, dynamic & adventurous tracks.On an overall scale, Ratatouille is a mouth-watering blend of action, adventure, ambition, art & awesomeness that continues Pixar's unbroken winning streak by hitting an eighth consecutive home-run for the studio and, with the help of its terrific direction, inventive screenplay, dazzling visuals, gorgeous animation, awe-inspiring camera-work, tight editing, exquisite use of humour & mesmerising score, effortlessly succeeds as one of the most enjoyable, entertaining & fulfilling films ever made. Inspiring, motivating & satiating on both visceral & emotional scale plus radiating its heartfelt warmth effectively from start to finish, this culinary classic is a finger-lickin' delicious cuisine that comes delightfully recommended.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Not as Incredible as ""The Incredibles""","Wow. Number 51 on IMDb's top 250, huh? I thought ""Ratatouille"" was cute, but I didn't like it THAT much.Pixar's latest boasts beautiful animation, perhaps the most accomplished yet, but the film as a whole never reached the inspired and dizzy heights attained by ""The Incredibles,"" to my mind a small masterpiece. ""Ratatouille"" straddles an awkward and ambiguous line: a little too cartoony to be a completely adult film, but a little too sophisticated to be dismissed as a film for kids. It tells a warm and touching story about accepting differences and overcoming our preconceived prejudices, but I kept waiting for that unique brand of Pixar humour that never (or at least rarely) surfaced.The best thing about this film is Peter O'Toole, who plays Anton Ego, a fearsome food critic who delivers a beautiful soliloquy at the film's climax that encourages people to embrace things that are new while still retaining the ability to discriminate between things that are quality and things that are not. The soliloquy also happens to sound beautiful as delivered in O'Toole's mellifluous voice.In a food culture dominated by total crap like McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Taco Bell (among others) I appreciated ""Ratatouille""'s reminder that good, well-prepared food is a way to treat your body while so many people are poisoning theirs'. But I just didn't see the masterpiece here that so many others seem to.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Tour De force for Francophiles and Pixar fans everywhere!,"After last years somewhat disappointing Cars, Pixar and Brad Bird have renewed my faith in movies with the delightful Ratatouille. The title itself is an actual French vegetable soup, and also that the narrator is a rat! Unlike other movies featuring rodents, the rats are realistic, and Remy actually washes his paws before cooking, unlike many Americans chefs I'm sure. Because many people on the forums are grumbling about how bad this movie is, let me tell you something; European culture is much different and sophisticated than here in America. There is a tender subtlety to this film that makes it speak to an older audience than previous films. So there isn't any violent action and anything of that kind, who cares? This a sweet, soft-spoken movie that hearkens back to when movies could be nonviolent and just as good.

"Fun, but for who?","Can Pixar fail? I think even if those geniuses tried, they would still end up making an Oscar winning film. Which brings me to Ratatouille. It's everything you would expect from a Pixar movie: a loving cast of characters, a cute little story that teaches an important lesson, and the infamous CGI that has made Pixar the most popular computer-animated company in the world.The story tells of a rat named Remy (Patton Oswalt) who longs to become a chef. However, there are two problems with that dream. First, he lives with a family of rats who enjoy nothing more than eating garbage, while Remy prefers more lavish cuisine. Second, a rat in any kitchen means trouble to the humans.Remy's dream seems impossible until he gets washed away in a sewer (a very Flushed Away moment) and resurfaces in his favorite restaurant, Gusteau's, in Paris, France! There, the storyline splits into two as we follow the tale of a clumsy misfit named Linguini (Lou Romano), a kitchen boy who works at the restaurant. A twist of fate brings the rat and the boy together, and they create a system: Remy cooks while Linguini acts as his cover.The story is where Ratatouille cuts somewhat short. It's more realistic than Cars (a world of talking cars? I never got it either) but it's still way too far fetched for adults. Unfortunately, a lot of the humor is above little kids' heads. So who was Brad Bird's target audience for this movie? I don't think even he knew.Despite the fact that the story may not fit for many audience members, I enjoyed every second of this movie. What it lacks in humor it makes up in heart, warmth, and amazing animation. Definitely not one to miss.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Without a doubt the animation was excellent but where was the storyline, the characterisation and (sadly) the laughs?The strength of movies of the calibre of Toy Story is that within moments the audience forgets it is watching CGI and gets wrapped up in the story and characters. With Ratatouille the sole strength is the CGI.I would have much preferred to watch a movie with OK animation that had an interesting plot but here all the energy had been put into making rat fur look realistic.Gets 4 out of 10 for being visually stunning and beautifully executed.

A Feast For All,"Ratatouille (2007) ****I'm not sure why, but I just can't allow myself to give Ratatouille anything less than full marks. As far as creativity in roles goes, its pretty standard dealing with humans (nothing new to animation there) and talking rats (linguistic rodents, been there done that). There are no talking cars or monsters or fish or super heroes. Ratatouille is an example of a classic storyline overhauled and directed at adults and children all the like. This IS a movie for everyone, young and old, rich or poor. To top it off, its without a doubt the most brilliantly piece of animated work I have ever seen.The movie is at once elitist and proletarian. It takes the lowest of all creatures, rats, and uses them to defend intelligence and quality and at the same time ridicules snobbery. It makes the rats cute, but at the same time still unsettling, especially when seen in packs.The film opens in the French country side, with a rat named Remy, our hero, jumping out of a window and then a freeze frame of him with glass smashing around him in mid air. Sound familiar movie buffs? It should. A direct homage to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. This is just the first of many salutes to other films right up to Usual Suspects.Remy gets separated from his clan and ends up in ol' Paris, which is stunningly animated right from the Eiffel Tower to the rotary and the cobble stones. To make a long review shorter, he meets up with the imagined ghost of the great Gusteau, who's motto 'everyone can cook' inspires the young rat. He is lead to Gusteau's restaurant, which has faded since his death, and is now run by a short temperamentally authoritarian chef. Remy manages to befriend a new kitchen worker named Linguini, who may or may not be Gusteau's son, who cannot cook unless Remy hides under his hat and uses some very interesting puppetry. Ratatouille takes classic character types and strips them down and removes the clichés and manages to deliver the unexpected. The film also takes those characters, their surroundings and the food they use to create their meals and animates then in absolutely stunning fashion. Every little detail is noted, from the look of a wet rats fur right down to the beats of water on fresh vegetables. The animation is nothing short of incredible.Yes, Ratatouille uses big words that kids won't get - they will however get the point - and that is because this film is first and foremost, I think, for adults. The kid factor is just a side pot. The films defining monologue comes from a critic, who acknowledges the ultimate insignificance of a critics work, yet retorts that their work is made worth while by being able to influence people to try something, if even only a few. It also acknowledges that though not everyone can be great, greatness truly can come from anywhere. This monologue is perhaps the best ever given in an animated film. Like the rest of the movie, it delivers its point in eloquent fashion, but does it easily enough that a child can understand what its getting at. The movie is not overly hilarious . Its not always going for those big laughs. It finds joy in going for big payoffs in quality. Its a great story, and it never forces itself to be funny. That said, don't think that this movie isn't a laugher, there are lots of good little jokes that will have you smiling. And after all, its often more pleasant to just sit there smiling from ear to ear often than busting a gut occasionally.And that is what makes Ratatouille so great. It truly is a film that manages to be ageless; defend quality through the lowest ranks while damning elitist snobs.The critic's monologue was right: We can't all be great, but greatness can come from anywhere. And Bird and his team at Pixar chose the least likely of creatures to carry out that message, and I'll tell you, those rats get the job done.4/4",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Excellent animation,"This film is about a culinary rat who befriends a young man, and displays his cooking skills in a fine Parisian restaurant.After watching this highly anticipated film, I can only say that the positive word of mouth is highly justified. The characters are lovely and cute, and they are all unique in their own way. The main character the culinary rat, is dedicated and determined. He develops an unlikely friendship with Linguini, who works at a restaurant but is clueless about cooking. The adventures they have together is exciting and engaging. The animation is excellent, everything is realistic and attractive. It is such a joy to see hundreds of rats cooking, which is a scene that could otherwise be unpleasant. The major theme of being able to succeed if you are dedicated and hard working is inspiring and encouraging. ""Ratatouille"" is a gem that mixes entertainment and positive encouragement.

Cute.,"I think Ratatouille is going to be most enjoyed by the kids and adults who are into cooking. I'm into cooking myself, but I mean SERIOUSLY into cooking, like people who are more interested in the kitchen of a fancy restaurant than in the food. The premise is pretty silly, a rat living in the sewers under the streets of Paris unwittingly discovers a talent for cooking that some of the most highly trained human chefs can't seem to attain, so he befriends a young boy, the garbage boy at the restaurant (who might remind you of young Wart from Sword in the Stone) and basically uses him as a puppet so he can get access to the kitchen. You see, other people working in the kitchen at fancy restaurants don't want a disease-infested rodent as a colleague, so there have to be some secrets.Needless to say, a lot of bizarre situations follow, as is to be expected when you have a rat controlling the head chef at a famous restaurant by hiding under his hat and pulling his hair.

Summer's Best?,"RATATOUILLE**** stars out of 5 (8/10).I can say, with little doubt, that ""Ratatouille"" is the best film I've seen all summer long. It mixes brilliant animation with good, old-fashioned film-making.Remy (PATTON OSWALT) is a strange rat. He prefers fine cuisine to the trash his family usually eats. He is also different in the fact that he can read, and cook the food he loves so dearly. Remy is eventually separated from his family, and he must find his way to survive in Paris, the fine food capitol of the world. One day, he is caught in a famous restaurant by Linguini (LOU ROMANO), the new garbage boy. Before he's about to dump Remy in the river, Linguini sees that the rat understands his words. Earlier, he saw the rat cooking up delicious soup, so he puts his head to work. The two unlikely friends begin to work together, so Remy can be a cook, and so Linguini can move up in the world of the restaurant business.This movie is smart, witty, and stunning to the eye. Brad Bird is a master of animation, and this is his best film to date. The movie can be quite funny, without going over the top on pop-culture references. It's so well-made that it makes some of the other summer pictures look like nothing. The animation is intricate, colorful, and comically realistic. It's scary the amount of detail the filmmakers went into. ""Ratatouille"" is a feast to the senses, and it finds a way of entertaining you throughout the entire movie.I won't do much complaining, but there are some little things I wasn't happy about. For once, I would like to see an animated movie without this kind of villain, and the stages of predictability he/she goes through to find out the scheme. Don't get me wrong, I liked the character Skinner (IAN HOLM), but the process has been in nearly every animated movie of late. It was directed well, but I guess I just want to see something new.Nonetheless, this film reaches a certain amount of greatness. The voice casting is perfect, and it will associate with all kinds of audiences. It's a flavor explosion, and you would be without taste not to enjoy this great Pixar dish.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Boring but beautiful,"Sorry, guys, but after all the hype this film received as a ""meaty"" animated film, I just can't agree that this will be a ""classic"" or some kind of turning point in animated film. I was bored from beginning to end, except for the scene with Anton Ego and his great speech about the critic's role in life. I mean, who is this film geared toward? Are kids the least bit interested in inside jokes about gourmet food prepared by a rat who wants to be a chef? (Anthony Bourdain's ""Kitchen Confidential,"" with his assertion that most people working in restaurants are ex-criminals, was all over this, of course.) It wasn't amusing or persuasive, and the storyline was entirely predictable and not much of a story anyway. I used to tell myself stories to make myself go to sleep at night about rabbits that wanted to swim like frogs and such--and this feels about as far-fetched and thin. It IS beautiful in its animated effects, of which it is rightfully proud--but maybe this is the problem. The process has taken over the content. I really wanted to like this, but it really fell flat.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"A Great Animated Story, Well deserved rating","When I first had heard about Ratatouille, I knew I had at least wanted to see it, but whether that meant in theaters or to wait for it on DVD, I was not so sure (I was not going to go out of my way just to see this film). I was definitely not as excited about this movie as I was for previous Pixar films.Well, an opportunity had come for me to go see it with a friend of mine and we chose to see at a matinée time, which not only meant cheaper tickets but also the pleasure of watching an animated film with a theater full of families and their little children.First, the animation of the film was as good as ever for Pixar films. The stylization of the characters really adds to the experience as a whole, as it helps to immerse the viewer into the film.Second, the voice acting of the film is really tremendous. I felt that each of the characters had their own voice that were unique and real. The voices weren't forced upon me as celebrity voices (as what happens in other movies such as Shrek and some of Pixar's other movies {Toy Story, Monster, Inc., etc.})But, it is the story that really makes this film. If you think about it, this film is closer to a two-hour film than most of Pixar's other animated films ( The Incredibles and Cars run about the same time as well). Yet, despite what I think can be a long running time for an animated film, I never got that feeling that I do with some films, which is ""When is this film going to end?"" or the occasional muttering to myself, ""This movie needs to get to the point."" The story hooks you in from the beginning and never lets you drop throughout the entire film. The ending is highly satisfying, not disappointing, what I consider to be a perfect ending, and leaves you walking out of the theater repeating, ""That was a good film.""All in all, Ratatouille is a superbly animated film with tremendous voice acting and a story that hooks you to beginning to end. I loved it, my girlfriend's mom loved it, and all the children I saw loved it as well. It is a film for all ages and one that will leave a lasting impression.While I don't consider this film to be as meaningful nor epic as films like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Godfather"", ""Ratatouille"" is in a different genre and as such it seems to be the top of its genre, bar-none. It is my favorite Pixar film to date and I can't wait to buy it when it comes out on DVD. With that it deserves the 10 out of 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Just Delicious,"""In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But"" this movie is not junk in any sense of the word. This movie is a masterpiece, therefore I must rate it as such. Among the great movies of all time, I'm sure it does not rank at the top. I'm sure it doesn't change any political problems or some flaw in the ecosystem and I'm sure it isn't the more expensive movie on record. I know for a fact that it does not employ the most well known, sought after actors in the business and I know that it did not break any monumental box office ranking. But what it did do is this: it created a new perspective on Pixar and gave it new depth.As a member of the Pixar generation, I've enjoyed every Animated film by them and can remember the day the Toy Story came out. I remember the first time I saw that lamp hop across the blued screen and hop onto the PIXAR ""I"", and I can say honestly that I have enjoyed no Pixar film as much as I enjoyed this one. I feel as though every film made previously has just been leading up to the production of this masterpiece, or to put in the context of the movie each film was a tasty hors d'oeuvres that beautifully lead into this delicious entree.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A unique and sophisticated animated film!,"""Ratatouille"" (2007) / Directed and written by: Brad Bird****(Excellent)This is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. Though it's largely a comedy, it ranks up there with some of Disney's best work, including Snow White, Bambi and Pinnochio. As usual, the Pixar digital animation is excellent and always improving in some small way with each new film. The step forward for this film, is water and how it's depicted in a very realistic manner. That's the small technical leap here. However, this is a rare film (of any genre), where all the right elements are done very well and all come together to make a unique and special film.""Ratatouille"" is a film with some surprisingly sly, sophisticated humor that goes beyond the expectations of the usual animated film. There's a surprisingly well written, humorous and touching story here, that probably connects better with adults than with children. Though there's plenty of action and humor children will find appealing, the humor and finer peaks of the story are more aimed at adults. I've rarely seen a film rated G that contains with such creativity and sophistication.A young man begins work in a famous restaurant in Paris. Here he accidentally meets and befriends a unique rat that was discovered in the restaurant kitchen. This young man has a secret connection to the restaurant. This unique rat has an affection for fine food and a talent for food preparation. It's a story idea that doesn't seem to hold much promise to hold adult attention and interest for the length of a feature film. However, there are a number of factors that strengthen the story, such as well conceived and voiced characters and a fine attention to visual detail.The look of Paris and food preparation is done with remarkable authenticity. The distinguished actor Peter O' Toole provides the voice of a hard hearted and egotistical restaurant critic. This character looks and sounds like a villain, however the real villain of the story turns out to be the current chef of the restaurant.Two of the best scenes of the film are when the current chef is getting the young man drunk on wine, in order for him to divulge his secrets of success. The other scene is when the hard hearted restaurant critic suddenly has a childhood flashback upon tasting one of the restaurants famous creations prepared in a new way.Though I think children will generally find this an entertaining film, it's adults who will most appreciate it's sophisticated, sly humor and amazing visual details. In an audience largely of families, I noticed a sometimes bewildered look on the face of a young girl sitting next to me during the film. It was at this time that adults better connected with the film than children.Not to forget the lively music score, which really supports the humor and dramatic moments of the film. The film editing provides the right pace and rhythm all throughout the film.Overall, ""Ratatouille"" celebrates the preparation of and enjoyment of fine food with a surprisingly well conceived and written story and characters. This film deserves two Oscar nominations: Best Original Screenplay and Best Animated Feature Film.Highly Recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It makes me want to cook!,"I give this film an 8.5 It's a delightful and enjoyable animation film. It's fun to watch. It's harmless and good for children. It's heart-warming. It has imagination and creativity. The idea of a rat who wants to be a cook is quite unique and the scenes where there are thousands of rat cooking in the kitchen is quite something to watch.However, there's nothing else to it. The story somehow goes on the cliché theme of ""Believe in yourself. You can be different."". Something Hollywood films say again and again and again,sometimes successfully, but most not. (Like in ""Happy Feet"", an animation that didn't impress me).Nevertheless, this film manages to inspire me a little. The first half of the story makes me want to cook! That quote ""Anyone can cook"" sounds so good for someone who doesn't really know how to cook, but admire the art of cooking so much, like me. I like the way little Remy enjoys cooking. It makes me feel that eating good food is truly a pleasure on earth and cooking is something fun.Overall, a good animation that you can enjoy watching and have a good time.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Food, Paris, and Pixar. What's not to like?","""No! You waste energy and time! You think cooking is a cute job, eh? Like Mommy in the kitchen?""Who knew that a movie about rats could be so charming and visually beautiful? Mice? Sure, The Great Mouse Detective and An American Tail did it years ago. But leave it to Pixar to make a lowly rat lovable, and even make him someone that we'd want fixing our food! Now, that is quite an accomplishment.Visually, this is one of my very favorite Pixar movies. The character designs are very appealing to me, and the technical detail is outstanding. The look of the characters themselves are only outshone by the marvelous Parisian backdrops that we get glimpses of through windows and from sky shots. The music is great, the message is good, and the story is entertaining for kids and adults. I put Ratatouille on that second Pixar tier. Not quite up to the brilliance and cleverness of Monsters Inc. and Toy Story, but a great animated movie in every regard.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"""It is about ze food, and zat is really enough to zell it to ze Americans...""","Remy (Patton Oswalt) was born with the unique gift of deciphering smells and tastes, and marrying the two effectively--a gift any chef would give their apron for. Unfortunately, Remy was also born a rat. When it becomes apparent that his family cannot really appreciate his gift outside of its use in avoiding rat poison, Remy attempts to refine his talents in human kitchens. He even has the guidance of the late, great master chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett) to influence his endeavors. A series of unfortunate events unfolds, and the little rat finds himself in the big city, namely Paris, attempting to prove his talent with the help of hapless kitchen boy Tony Linguini (Lou Romano, Bernie Kropp in ""The Incredibles"") to the most discriminating of palates, including that of tough-as-nails critic Anton Ego (Peter ""The Great"" O'Toole). This is actually a nice piece of storytelling and an even better piece of animation. The environments of Paris and the French countryside are represented in grand scale--Bird's capable team and Pixar's diligent artists even manage to make a sewer look amazing! Meanwhile, you truly get the desperation and inspiration driving some well-designed characters, who are sure to remain memorable. Bird's fans might be a pinch disappointed in this one, though--it doesn't have that breakthrough stance employed so boldly with ""The Iron Giant"" or ""The Incredibles"", although it is nice to see him take on something a little lighter. A few lulls in the pacing make it feel a bit long, and technically, it's probably a little TOO good. It's evident that the Pixar crew did their usual in-depth study on the subjects, and while the rats are designed cute, the sight of millions of them gushing out of kitchens and houses made my skin crawl and took me right back to cult head-turners like ""Ben"" and ""Willard"" (brush up on your film history if you're unfamiliar with those). While far from Bird's or Pixar's finest, it's still a good time, and really a must for those of you (You know who you are!) who truly appreciate food.

There's a rat in the kitchen what am I going to do?,"There's a rat in the kitchen, what am I going to do? I am going to kill that rat thats what I am going to do! That is a line from a UB40 song. It is probably what I would have said before I saw this picture. However, Remy is such a cute little blue rat. I would never think of hurting him. However, in the kitchen of a restaurant maybe another story.You could tell I was no débutante. Anyhow, my review of this film. I love Pixar animation films. I think they are great. This was no exception. The film had an excellent story with some great themes. Determination, follow your dreams, anyone can cook,hope, friendship,being creative. Cooking is a type of art form. It is wondrous to watch as chefs put together these ingredients in such a way as to make something the is both pleasing to the eye as well as the pallet. Ratatouille is very pleasing to the eye. We are introduced to Remy, the young determined rat, as he is trying to combine ingredients in a farm house that he is soon roused out of (see the movie , I am not giving it away). After sometime in the sewers of Paris, he finds the place to be able to express himself. There is such heart to this film that it is one that I have enjoyed watching over and over.

"""One can get too familiar with vegetables you know?""","Ratatouille (2007) -Overall I found this film charming and enjoyable, with some lovely moments of humour and the endearing, enduring Disney ethics and production values that can always be found in their works, but I wouldn't exactly say that it was outstanding.Personally, I believe that Disney were at their peak with the more traditionally styled films when they created such greats as 'Aladdin' (1992), 'Beauty And The Beast' (1991) and even 'The Little Mermaid' (1989).There have also been the likes of 'Finding Nemo' (2003) and the 'Toy Story' (1995/1999/2010&2019) films that I tend to class as separate, because of the way that they were created on a computer. I can see that is the way that they have decided to go with their animations, since the success of those mentioned and 'Ratatouille' probably falls under the same category, a sort of modern look at life, rather than based on an existing fairy tale.It doesn't really come close to 'Toy Story' or 'Nemo' though.The variety and width of audience that they could expect to appreciate this one was far narrower than those others, which managed to incorporate a lot of real life moments to connect to, as well as nostalgia and humour for all viewers.So while I enjoyed it as an everyday animated film that made me giggle, it didn't quite contain all of the ingredients to bring me back to watch it again too soon and certainly not as often as 'Beauty And The Beast', 'Toy Story' and a recent favourite 'Rango' (2011) have and will.Production wise, I was glad of the subtitles, because the accents were a bit strong, causing issues with the diction, which might have made it tough for younger audiences. Colette, voiced by Janeane Garofalo was almost impossible to keep up with, but Ian Holm as Skinner the Head Chef wasn't quite so bad. I also liked that he had to use a ladder for most things. It was a cute character trait that helped to show his Napoleon complex. Apt for a short French man.Peter O'Toole was the perfect voice for the Food Critic, Anton Ego and oddly he was my favourite character in the entire film.The concept was a tad odd, but not completely outrageous and definitely not so far from children's stories about kissing Frogs that turn in to Princes or Elephants with such large ears that they can fly.However, I think this one would definitely be better for older kids, with a lot of the actual story being lost on the younger ones, who might at least enjoy the fast chases and fun little animal characters.It would also be suitable for the Disney uber fan of course or for adults that like more juvenile viewing, like my Mother, who is currently ploughing her way through the back catalogue on Disney+. Who doesn't love a bit of simple escapism though, something to take us away from the horrors in the real world, which this film did provide.739.56/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Very, very good... but...","I love Pixar. As a studio they have created a new form of cinema that grows and evolves with every new film they make. In fact, I'd say that if I had the chance to work for any company in the world, Pixar would be it, even if it was just to empty the trash.What I've admired most about Pixar movies is that story has always been of the utmost importance; technology has always been used to serve the story, not the other way around.Being the Pixar fan that I am, I was looking forward to RATATOUILLE, particularly since director Brad Bird did such a wonderful job with THE INCREDIBLES, and I'm sort of a sucker for ""follow your dream"" stories to begin with. The idea of a rat who dreams of cooking in a Paris restaurant sounded just goofy enough to work.On a lot of levels, RATATOUILLE does work. Bird was clearly ambitious here, with an obvious affection for food, Paris, and good restaurants. The kitchen he renders here is beautifully detailed and Bird even manages to sneak in a little tour that faithfully describes the various positions. Visually, there is a lovely warmth to this movie; who could have foreseen 10 years ago that CG animation could do justice to the City of Light?The weakness here is in the story. And it's not that the story is bad--it's orders of magnitude better than, say, SHREK THE THIRD--just not strong enough to support director Bird's ambitions. There is little real sense of peril here, and the characters aren't terribly well-developed.I enjoyed RATATOUILLE, even admired much of it, but Pixar needs to sharpen its story skills if it wants to stay at the top of the heap.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Make a new history and new future for Pixar and Disney,"I watched it a few hours ago and I could not help to stop thinking about this movie. Every scene was beautiful and incredible story and it was really funny movie. I believe I laughed almost an hour or more. Plot pace was quite fast so I felt that movie is more than 2 hours movie and enjoyed it very and very long.Reason for saying this movie is make a new history and new future for Pixar and Disney. Because when people talk about the animation is for child only and then movie was not good enough for adult, this movie can shut them up. Most interestingly, when I watched movie in Malaysia cinema at 4.40pm show during weekday, I heard that adult are laughing around (let's just say) half an hour and kids are laughing around half an hour and they are laughing together around half an hour. It was very interesting experience. I watched movie alone so sometimes I felt bit sorry for kids beside of me because I laughed a few times when their not laughing so they did not understand why I am laughing at. So my point is adult can enjoy movie very much and kids, too. Adult should not have to lower down their expectation from the movie.I do not know about what happen in the native English speaking country's cinema but I think it probably have same happen to them.So I believe Disney and Pixar did it again for new generation of family movie.There has one problem, maybe. Kids are not enjoy much than other Disney Pixar movie, maybe. I am not so sure about it. But, at least all the family member can enjoy it so it was good thing.I highly recommended to anyone.10.0 out of 10.0.* added at 21 August 2007 I rated as 10 but it is possible to go down when I was watched it again.

This should get nominated for a couple Oscars next year and win one of them. That is not for a long time, but it's something to look forward to. In conclusion, this cooks up a feast you'll never forget. I hope you don't want to forget it at all. This is my new favorite movie, and that probably won't change until the film Wall-E comes out.

"The Food, The Rat And The Agleam","What can be said about this film? It's droll and sympathetic, that could be expected and ain't too remarkable. Good thing is that Disney begins to spare us their musical-attacks in their films (although they turned less annoying in recent years for example with Mulan"") and gets away from too predictable sympathic"" animals like deer, snobistic cats or Dalmatians (one of the most overrated dog-types at all). It was about time to root for some underdogs ... aaah, rats!

His ability to cook extraordinary meals just by using his gifted senses takes him all the way to Paris, where he finds himself cooking for the finest restaurant in Paris; under an untalented busboy's hat.The animation is crisp, smooth and beautifully done, and the writing is hilarious and relate-able, as well, not to mention the great voice acting by Patton Oswalt and Brad Garret.Anyone and everyone, children and adults, will find something to love in this film, and nobody will walk out without a smile on their face.Highly recommended. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Computer animation taken up a notch,"It is one thing to take the animation up a notch, as the film does fantastically. But they have also increased the sophistication of the story telling.Right on par with Bird's other films for Disney/Pixar, Ratatouille makes excellent use of characters and story. There is enough to keep the kids entertained (the usual Pratt falls, chases, etc), as well as an ever growing sophisticated humor and story telling that opens up the general audience to enjoy the film, not just the kids.Back in the 2nd golden age of animation (mid-late 80's to late 90's) Disney was able to tap into a wider audience by providing state of the art animation with more complex stories. As the computer age was ushered in, once again Disney rose to the occasion a long with Pixar. Though with their last outing CARS, they took a step back, here with Ratatouille they regain the momentum again.The strange thing about Ratatouille is there is no easily marketable tie-in toy. Of course, that hasn't stopped the Disney folks from trying to peddle stuffed rats. But for the first time a film of theirs has to totally sell itself by story alone and that makes this a very successful movie in my opinion. It does succeed without the tie-in.Voice work across the board is spot on. There are no highly recognizable actors lending voice talent to remove you from the world. Ratatouille creates a world that you stay within. This could bring about similar voice casting in the future where some known voices are used, but the leads, as is the case here, are filled with mostly unknowns.Great job overall!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Ratatouille,"When this movie first came out and I was relatively young I did the mistake of allowing the animated nature of this movie cloud my judgement. If I had known better, I may have been able to appreciate this movie far earlier.I have not seen another children's movie that contains as much important and profound messages as Ratatouille. The way it tells the story prepares you very well for every point it has to make, and in the end these ideas start settling down, everything starts making sense, not just the movie, but life. Listening to Anton Ego's review in the end felt like drinking a warm glass of milk and honey on a cold day, it was not just comforting, it wasn't just uplifting, it felt essential, it felt as though the cold had finally gone.At some point in life we all find ourselves in an existential crisis, we start questioning our identity and our purpose in life. I've never watched something that has given me a better sense of identity and meaning than this movie right here. Remy is an inspiration, he is aware of what he is and how nature has defined his life to be, but that does not stop him from finding a purpose. He had a gift, he never had a desire to make something of it until he was inspired by Chef Gusteau; for a rat to cook life had a long list of challenges awaiting Remy but god damn it he found a way that works. He could have spent his life sniffing food to prevent poisonings in his colony, a task which is very meaningful and perhaps to many rats, a drram",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A triumph in animation,"Ratatouille is, by all measures, an unqualified triumph in animated filmmaking. I have no reservations recommending it to anyone, for it is a masterful blend of great ingredients. The animation is firstly marvellous- it is warm, bright, and almost even realist in some places. The colours are vivid and there is great detail without sacrificing warmth. The voice acting is also, expectedly for a Pixar film, very well done- the voices and their intonation seamless blend with the character traits of the characters. Ratatouille also has a funny, interesting, warm story which enthrals the audience, whether young or old. Personally though, I have never been a fan of Children's movies, and while this is a film which I believe has a wide audience appeal, I still must hesitate to rate it higher. Children's films will always be children's films- they inevitably rely on a feel good story with easy, animated dialogue. Unfortunately for myself and myself only, my inner child has vanished, and it is difficult in general to connect with exaggerated dialogue and monologues. If I were to offer a disinterested opinion however, I find Ratatouille to be one of the greatest animated films I have watched, and I can unreservedly recommend it to anyone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"A wonderful movie for the whole family. Intelligent fun for the parents, too.","The film is a complex and skillfully executed animated movie. Editing is perfect, and of it would be impossible to cut anything - it all belongs there. The plot progression is gripping, and transitions smooth. Writing a detailed, complete review that does this little gem justice is close to impossible, since it would have to give away not one, but several, not entirely predictable, plot twists. So here is the short version.On the surface, Ratatouille is a children's story (and kids in the audience were enjoying it, judging by their reaction) with a fairly ridiculous premise: a rat in the kitchen might be a good thing! But on closer inspection its numerous, layered themes run much deeper: it's a kid-accessible, sincere narrative about pursuing one's passion for something, about talent and its clashes with reality (credit and accolades do not always go to those who deserve it), about discovering one's own identity and having the resolve to assert it, about prejudice and how difficult it is to overcome, and, above all, about that old-fashioned virtue, honesty, even if it comes (as it often does) at a price. Ratatouille truly is a family-values film par excellance.The tale recounts a story of Remy, a young rat, who has a passion for food and for cooking. He also has an incredibly discerning palate and nose, a talent which in his rodentian predicament, has very limited uses. Remy dreams of something more. In the great tradition of ""unlikely friends - yet best friends"" (Elliott and ET, Charlotte and Wilbur, Nemo and Dory) Remy's path will cross that of Linguini, an orphan boy in a desperate search for a job, and the two will have to battle adversity against all odds, sometimes with each other, and at times, despite of each other. Although it sounds like a typical stock plot, Ratatouille is not as predictable as might seem from movie's trailers available online, and (like Charlotte's Web) is by far darker than usual children's stories, which in this case is actually a good thing. Early on, for example, Remy (the rat) has to deal with death and the pain of personal loss. Linguini's life (the boy) too, has had its dark moments. Even the ending (without giving the details away) is a surprisingly reasonable, low-key compromise, rather than a straightforward ""happy ending triumph"" that fans of more traditional Disney solo productions may be accustomed to (think the triumphant endings of Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, and even Finding Nemo; not here).The story itself is a canvas for a surprisingly progressive (for Disney / Pixar) social commentary, and poses numerous questions which parents will find themselves hard-pressed to answer easily (but it might be a good exercise). I suspect that many of the questions are there more for the parents, than for the kids. For example, Does one owe loyalty to one's family and clan, or to one's dreams? Which one should one give up, if decision has to be made? Is it OK to have friends who are ""different,"" despised by people in your social circle, and is it always easy? Is there a price to be paid for being faithful to oneself, one's friends, and being honest, and why one must choose to pay it. Ratatouille's numerous characters also tend to be more dimensional than in usual children's narratives. The ""good guys"" are charming and likable; and the villains (there are two), are cleverly drawn. For the kids, there is the more traditional stock villain (greedy, jealous and conniving), but for the amusement of grown-ups there is also the more complex, Anton Ego, a mordacious food critic, whose brief, but significant appearance contains a wonderfully humorous tribute to Proust's famous madeleine cookies scene in In Search for Lost Time.There is a good measure of fast-paced chases, races, rescue-and-escape sequences, and rides which seem to be deliberately designed to be easily converted into interactive games and Disney theme park rides. The motorcycle-and-boat race, a clever, humorous pastiche taken right out of recent Bond movies, is a real tour de force of timing, and a dazzling display of computer animation, as is Remy's bumpy ride on turbulent waters of Paris sewers. My absolute favorite among the fast-paced sequences, is the ""coincidences"" kitchen scene, in which creative and clever use of kitchen tools and appliances evokes the bravura sequences from Michael Frayn's play Noises Off. Last, but not least, there are the visuals, and here too, Ratatouille delivers: the suddenly revealed, sweeping view of Paris rooftops and the Seine at dusk cannot ever be matched by mere reality; the image of a tiny rat contemplating this breathtaking view from the roof, in unison with the awed audience, adds the requisite poignancy. As far as children's films go, Ratatouille's ""magic moments"" are as magically wonderful as they get. This is a great movie for the whole family (for a longer version of this review, see my blog).",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar cooks up a few good items here.,"Pixar's Ratatouille is an overly imaginative animated film (anybody would think so when watching rats cook food in Paris), where a rat named Remy dreams of becoming a French chef despite him being a rodent pretty much despised by all humans. After a run-in with an eccentric old woman in his home, he wounds up retreating to the restaurant Gusteau's in Paris, where his passion for cooking food intertwines with a chef-wannabe named Linguini.The animation is brilliant in a way that captures the wonders and beauty of Paris and the texture and aura of gourmet food. Unless you are really interested in cooking shows or culinary arts, the first part of the film might be a little dull to you as much of it is consumed with Remy's obsession about culinary arts, and the restaurant chefs blabbering about food and critics. However, the movie gets more interesting and plot picks up steam when Remy meets Linguini and tries to help cook food to impress the annoying Head Chef Skinner, all the while trying to fulfill his dreams at the same time.The portrayal of the rats and their physical movements were actually quite cute at times. The chemistry between Linguini and Chef Colette was mismatched and lacked charm. The animation of the rats were good, but the humans were a little more sub-par I thought, especially that of Linguini and Colette (can never understand those over-sized eyes and noses).Overall, it's a movie that will have you craving for gourmet food, visit Paris, and encourage you to fulfill your life goals. Not a bad Pixar movie.Grade B-",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Disney has officially destroyed Pixar,"Oh Disney...you are the Grim Reaper to creative studios like Pixar.Ratatouille's main strength was the animation; absolutely amazing. There are times you think you're seeing a real rat trounce down the streets of Paris. But what Ratatouille lacked that other Pixar cartoons didn't was a fun story line & great voice actors to compliment the animation.The best part of the night wasn't actually part of Ratatoiulle.....it was the 5-minute short cartoon that preceded it. The alien characters in the opening short didn't say a word but conveyed so much more personality. In Ratatouille, Peter O'Toole was the only actor to bring life to his character. The other actors & writers failed miserably. That's usually where Pixar shines....making cartoons funny for adults & kids. Ratatoiulle didn't come close to capturing the personality of The Incredibles or Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc. Kids all over the theater were bored out of their minds.I don't know how in the world this has been so revered by viewers & critics. It's the worst Pixar movie to date....BY FAR.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Loved it,"This was a great movie for my son and myself. I just graduated culinary school a year ago, and the terms were foreign to me back in the beginning of school. But, now that I am trained, it was refreshing to see a cartoon movie that properly used terms such as ratatouille, saucier, sous chef, etc. and to actually know what they meant. I actually suggested some peers from culinary school to go see it. What a great movie. I will definitely be adding it to my DVD collection when it's available.Have a delicious day,Chef Shiane",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I loved this movie!!,"Some of the best animation I have ever seen, and the characterizations, the voice talent, the story .... all first rate. I don't know when I've enjoyed myself so much.At first, I'll admit, I was so focused on the detail of the animation (the water on Remy's fur, actually, the animation of the water period), but I soon got so sucked into the story that I stopped being distracted.I especially liked that the character of Remy (although he could read) did not have the ability to speak to the humans. That one fact added so much to the humor, but also to the pathos and the misunderstandings between the two.I'm glad I took a little something from the budget to buy this on DVD. I didn't go see it in the theater (and now I regret that decision), but I know I'll watch it a few times a year from now until I breathe my last.I'm 55 and don't have any children, so I have nothing to go by, but I didn't see anything in the film that would upset a child. Remy ends up in some peril, but it never lasts for long, and at the very least this isn't one of those films where we have young Remy blamed for and dealing with the death of a parent. That's a plus in my book.I just plain loved this movie. I can't think of a bad thing to say about it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Personal comments,"How can I fail to comment on this delightful film? Not only is it wonderful entertainment and pleasant to watch, it is about a country in which I currently live, about a subject very close to my heart  food, that is!  and contains seemingly extraneous elements of personal importance.The basis, if not the model, of the film's centerpiece is a restaurant near my home town, Napa, California. Thomas Keller's famous 'French Laundry' occupies a building that was once a real laundry in the 19th century post-Gold-Rush days of Yountville, in the center of the Napa Valley. His restaurant is now one of the most famous in America and a feature of the Valley's colorful late 20th century renaissance.Another nostalgic connection is a real version of the automobile belonging to the character Skinner, an 1960s Facel Vega, belonged to a colleague of mine when we worked in Geneva, Switzerland. He took it with him when he returned to America to live near Washington, DC. Not only did this elegant French automobile have an American engine but also had the distinctive Chevrolet wraparound wind screen of the era. I don't know that the US components kept it from being more popular; I think it was simply another example of the many makes produced in small numbers that did not differentiate themselves and survive in the marketplace.All-in-all, 'Ratatouille' is both a charming film but also a nostalgic reminder for me of pleasant times.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Amazing! A feat in animation!,"I love good animated movies. I love 'Finding Nemo', 'Monster House', 'Happy Feet', 'Monster's Inc.', 'The Incredibles', and 'A Bugs Life', but 'Ratatouille' blows them out of the water. Ratatouille was amazing. It didn't lack in story. It didn't lack in comedy. It didn't lack in amazing animation, and it was ruthlessly cute. This is one of the movies that you go to for your children, but end up staying at for yourself. It was simply astounding. I think that all the voicing was great, with a little exception for Collette's accent, which wasn't quite up to par for me, but who cares? The rest of the movie is great enough to make you forget about anything like that. The satirizing of the French is simply hilarious. It is just a terrific movie, and I will definitely be seeing it again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
very entertaining and thought-provoking Pixar effort,"Ratatouille is a thought-provokingly superb Pixar effort, effortlessly besting its nearest rivals in the Animated Category. Brad Bird's animated tale of a rat (Remy) who pursues his dreams of becoming a world class chef in Paris is very entertaining, although more geared towards adults. The story will be of lesser interest to kids (apart from the excellent physical comedy routines). The story doesn't take the easy way out, but instead takes it time setting up the characters. The animation is brilliant. Peter O'Toole is perfect as a cynical critic, and the scene where he first tastes Remy's cuisine has to be seen to be believed. His climactic speech where he bemoans the cynicism and futility of critics is quite deep for a cartoon! Truly one of the finest Pixar films yet, only slightly below Wall.E and The Incredibles.Overall 9/10",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Bon Appetit for ""Ratatouille""","""Ratatouille"", Pixar's latest animated flick, may not rank in the same caliber as ""Finding Nemo"" or ""The Incredibles"", but it is a tasty, entertaining movie that serves a touching message, like all the other Pixar movies do.If you think that movies about packs of rats are horrifying, then think again. Yes, you will see thousands of rats running wild, but these animated rats serve a far different purpose. These rats do not destroy mankind and eat people, and these rats are so benevolent. Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt), the gray, furry main character, is different from the rest of his clan, and is the most intellectual rodent of them all. Remy is so tired of scourging garbage, and wants to cook in a French restaurant after stealing legendary chef Auguste Gusteau's (voiced by Ray Romano)book, ""Anyone Can Cook"" in the home of an elderly woman that drove the rat pack away with a shotgun. His father (voiced by the ever-burly Brian Dennehy) does not approve of that, and wants him to accept the fact that he is a rodent unwanted in the human world. His brother Emile, the chubby, brown animal, approves of Remy's desires, but isn't nearly as picky as Remy is. Like the rest of the pack, Emile is only too happy to eat any garbage there is.Once Remy gets from the sewers to the restaurant, Gusteau's, he sees Gusteau's ghost, which gives him guidance on how to be a great chef. You see, Gusteau died of a broken heart after the evil food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole voicing it with pure gusto)took away one of the five stars. Ego's scathing reviews can put any restaurant out of business. At the restaurant, Remy hides under the hat of bumbling garbage boy turned chef Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano), and Linguini can only cook well if Remy is around to pull his curly, red hair or gnaw at him under his clothes. Also at the restaurant is Collete (voiced by Janeane Garofalo), the only female chef who is at first reluctant to reciprocate Linguini's romantic interest in her, but then they fall in love, and Skinner (voiced by Ian Holm), the venal head chef and owner of Gusteau's who wants to do away with Remy, his rat pack that invade the kitchen near the end of the film, Linguini's sloppiness, and market Gusteau's products as fast or frozen foods. And Pixar good luck charm John Ratzenberger, as always, brings comic relief to his characters, here as the mustachioed maitre d' Mustafa.As the movie goes on, messages abound. For instance, Ego remembers eating ratatouille as a little boy and decides to give it a good review and then lightens up his dark image. Note that Ego is definitely drawn darkly. But the real message of the movie is that when you are a lowly rat, you can rise to your status, go beyond it, and your clan can too.All the actors are in fine form for their voice parts. Oswalt is humorous and affecting as Remy. Garrett and Garofalo don perfect French accents for their characters. Dennehy gets into character as the tough father. Ratzenberger, as I said before, does his usual Pixar shtick. Holm brings menace to his role. But it is the reliable O'Toole who really enjoys the part as the dark, brooding critic, and does the best voice work of all, outdoing all the rats.Although this a G-rated movie, I would not recommend this to very young children. Skinner tells Linguini ""Welcome to Hell"" as he hires him at the restaurant. There is a lot of wine drinking, and in G-rated movies, alcohol, smoking, and the aforementioned cussing are not used in such movies. And small children may be frightened at the sight of swarms of rats and then dead rats in one sequence. I did admire the upbeat messages of this movie such as what it's like to be a critic or rat, and I am being a critic right now, fair, but not lenient or evil like Ego. However, the thousands of rats together can be a put-off for many. Still, a good film, and the best part of it was the restaurant and the drawings of the City of Lights, and you feel like you want to travel there and eat at Gusteau's.And hopefully in the near future there shall be a Gusteau's somewhere in Disneyworld, but don't count on rats cooking the meals.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Warm And Tender-Hearted,"Warm-hearted, tender animation with more than a hint of Cyrano de Bergerac - if you substitute romantic love for cooking.

Funny and with a heart in the right place, it's easy to see why it's such a loved film - even though it's not my personal favourite.

And I laughed twice in the last 10 minutes and maybe once before that.It's just not that entertaining.

Excellent and funny...,"When the German version of this movie came out at 3rd October (national holiday in Germany) I saw it right at the first day. The room in the movie theater was full of course. There were also some little kids watching it. I must say there are not many movies where I laughed as much as during Ratatouille. At some parts all the spectators giggled. It's very, very funny, but not silly or childish. There're also some serious parts in the movie, although it's not too unsmiling or too emotional for being fun. The only thing I have to say against Ratatouille is that I don't think it's qualified for general audience and should be rated higher than G. I would rate it PG (6 in Germany). In my opinion Pixar created a very good mixture with much funny, some serious and a few action elements and the result is this moving picture.Furthermore I've never seen a movie at theater before where the entire audience applauded during the end credits. I think the movie Ratatouille is the best flick Pixar ever made. It's really worth to be seen. And I hope it will make more money than other Pixar productions like Finding Nemo.

Prediction: Pet Rat Sales Sky Rocket!,"Being a gigantic fan of Vermin and Gourmet Cooking I just had to see this. Pixar is back with another fantastic, funny, warm-hearted adventure that is really going to stand the test of time. So far the reviews for Ratatouille are unbelievable and I don't think they'll ever let up. And ya know what, this movie deserves all the praise it's gonna get.Ratatouille is the story about a little rat named Remy. Remy is basically your regular looking rat. Though Remy is a little different. What separates him from his fellow rats is that he's got a special talent. Remy's little schnoz is incredibly fine-tuned. He can smell this from that with no problem whatsoever. Well, this amazing smelling ability gives him fantastic ideas when it comes to food, and eventually cooking. What follows is a timeless tale where Remy and his pal Linguini take to the kitchen to resurrect a once world re-known french restaurant. Will they satisfy the food critics? Or will they get fried?Ratatouille is a perfect movie-going experience. I really can't find anything wrong with it. Entertaining situations led by unique characters with amazing voice work. Every environment be it the Paris backdrop, an Old Lady's backyard or even an awkward chef's pad is absolutely stunning. Ratatouille isn't just for the wee ones either. Pretty much all the jokes are adult-level humor. Obviously you got the slips and falls and one-joke characters that the kids will love, but so will the grown-ups. The writing is top notch stuff, some of the best writing around without a doubt. I can't recommend this flick enough.

It's here to entertain you, and that's something it does very well.It's strange, but a few people seem to hate this film, though.

"Brad Bird and Pixar's best, and that's saying a lot","Ratatouille is the best animated film made in the US since Beauty and the Beast. Believe me, that's not a put down against American animation.

No, not in terms of mature content (it's G-rated through and through) or in thematic elements (there's nothing here that will frighten or confuse the youngsters). Its maturity comes in the form of how Bird is willing to acknowledge that, yes, audiences appreciate smart films. This is a SMART movie. It presents a situation that a weaker filmmaker would exploit for cheap gags and obvious plot turns, and makes a hilarious, touching, and all around extraordinary film out of it. The writing and direction are top notch. The animation is the most gorgeous, some of it the most creative, that Pixar has turned out yet.Bird combines these elements into an absolutely wonderful film that is unconventional, beautiful, and just plain fun.Edit- Jackhorrorshow, please watch movies before casting any sort of judgment.

*Chef's Kiss*,"""Ratatouille"" is yet another great Pixar film. It is brought to us by director Brad Bird who has previously made ""Iron Giant"" and ""The Incredibles"" along with some Golden Age ""Simpsons"" stuff. Like all Pixar films of the time, it was a box office smash (making 623 million dollars) and a critical darling (winning best Animated Picture at the Oscars). But when I first saw the film, it didn't sit well with me. I didn't care for how it ended and consequently thought the whole thing was just OK.In subsequent viewings I have learned to like the film a lot more. I now see the ending in a different light and legitimately enjoy the movie. There are still some plot points that still bother me. Some conflicts feel artificial and the movie's double antagonist make the pacing lopsided.But enough of the negatives, onto the many things that make the film great.

Kitchen rat cooks,"Eww, rats in a restaurant. Well if it's an animated restaurant, where the story is just told for entertainment purposes, then this movie succeeded. I must admit, seeing that many rats (even if animated), can be disturbing. Once they started speaking English in Paris, and gave the little rodents characteristics comprehensible to humans, then the fear of animated rats in the animated kitchen subsided. I'll give the writers credit for disallowing the main character, Remy the rat, from speaking to Linguini, but only gestures to him on how to cook. The movie is sometimes implausible, and yet the story has an innate charm to hold your attention. This maybe an animated film, but it's also undoubtedly a ""food"" movie, with Remy being inspired by Chef Gusteau, the pleasures of fine dining. It is also somewhat of a morale lesson, in that, Chef Gusteau as a ""ghost"" supplies Remy with more than the fine art of cooking. I'd have to disagree that this is a classic Disney tale. No one dies and there's no rain. Even the chief villain (the food critic Ego) has a happy ending.

Worse Pixar film yet,"Let's start with a positive....The Pixar short before Ratatouille is brilliant! Now the negative, Ratatouille is definitely too long for younger children (trt: 1:50), and the story is certainly too ""deep"" for a 4-7 year old. Also, not that I'm a prude, however, a certain type of film is expected from Pixar/Disney when it is rated ""G"". Why my child needs to be exposed to an old lady running around the house shooting a shotgun at a ""living"" creature is beyond me. I'm sure the creative types at Pixar could have come up with a way to make the point that she wanted the rats out of the house without taking the easy way out and having her shoot at them with a gun. I also think that Pixar should stay with animating non-human characters (cars, fish, toys, etc), they seem to struggle with making the human characters ""human"".

Most humans in cartoons these days are just really badly drawn. This film took great lengths to accentuate the facial qualities of each character in a way not seen since the old Disney classics. The story was solid, the jokes were funny, and there was very little smarm (ugh!) - just one scene, but you will have to see it for yourself to know which one - and a very satisfying ending.I liked the subtle messages of the movie, and the fact that they were at once subtle but almost obvious to even the casual watcher. I may have laughed the loudest in the theater, so perhaps some of the jokes may go above the heads of the prime demographic (on the way out of the theater I was assaulted by hordes of urchins all gleefully clamoring ""Ra-ta-tooie!"" over and again at their beleaguered parents).

Clearly the best animated film of this year .......till now.Lets hope for more brilliance from Pixar.Cheers to Ratatouille.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
On a rewatch,"'There's a rat in mi kitchen, what am I gonna do?' ...I'm gonna put it under my huge chef's hat and let it make food using my arms in a weird puppet type manner. Not having seen this film since it was out in cinemas NINE YEARS AGO, I could only remember bits and pieces, so it was nice to come back and watch the whole thing almost as if it was the first time. There were a few humorous elements that would've gone over my head as a young kid and now knowing who the voice cast actually are is a treat. The best part of this movie was the finale, starting from when the rats took over the kitchen - man, not only was it comedy gold but that's the kind of ending all films need to have. It was funny, it was tense and, surprisingly, emotional.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Please oh please let this one win an Oscar!,"I saw this movie not long ago. Now I'm waiting for it to be out on DVD. This is another one of Pixar's great films. Compared to the other disappointing animated films this year, like Shrek the Third and Bee Movie, it tops number 1 of the animated features of 2007. Indeed, this film seems to have a far better chance on winning an Oscar this year than any other animated movie. It has been a great success world-wide, and I really enjoyed it, just as I enjoyed The Incredibles - Brad Bird's last movie. I will be very disappointed if Ratatouille doesn't win best animated feature at the Oscars this year, that it will lose to a less truthful title like Shrek the Third or being second best to Bee Movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Brilliant,"I've seen this movie after a hard day at work, and I wasn't sure what to expect. It was an incredible surprise.It brought back some wonderful memories and I felt like the world was a better place.The voice acting is impeccable, and I was particularly impressed by Peter O'Tool's performance ( no surprise there tho ). The animation is remarkable, the music blends with the movie, the entire plot is original, entertaining and much, much more. I never ever thought an animation could have such an intense message! It just erases all of your worries, concerns and problems and replaces them with hope, ambition, or simply happiness.Don't hesitate, see this movie whenever you get the chance, be it with your friends, your children, your parents or just by yourself. I guarantee it will put a smile upon even the most troubled face.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Cute (So-oh-oh Disney) versus WOW,"I recently saw ""Paprika"" and ""Ratatouille"" in close succession, in that order. I can only say that ""Ratatouille"" was an intense disappointment, especially when measured against a film like ""Paprika,"" which demonstrates the adult potential of animation. The Rat story was a kid story with a good moral but was unexceptional and banal in its execution on the screen. Unlike ""Spirited Away"" & ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" which are both moral stories appropriate for children (as opposed to, say, ""Grave of the Fireflies""), ""Ratatouille"" was not at all sophisticated or imaginative in its presentation. Big noses and crooked teeth are a limited device for conveying the Gallic character and the villain's pencil-thin moustache made him look as if he'd been recycled from a WW II animated piece on the Pacific theatre.I am not an unmitigated fan of Japanese popular culture which is often kitschy and misogynistic, but its clear that if animation is the measure, American productions are the mega-losers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I used to hate rats but no more,"Everyone can cook! Even a rat! For being one, the main character Remy is born with an unusual taste for food. He often sneaks in to an elderly woman's house to get the only food thats good enough for him but soon find himself in trouble. While escaping with his fellow rats, he gets lost and ends up at a restaurant in Paris. Remy gets in touch with the restaurants garbage man who is very untalented and learn how hard it is out there for a rat with ambition.I used to hate rats but no more. Ratatouille touch me like no other animated movie. When a cartoon masterpiece is celebrated, it is often only the special effects you remember, but this time, the amazing script is the key to pixars latest masterpiece. The effects is still brilliant thou. When i read that the director Brad Bird only was an executive producer of The Simpsons, it makes me realize why the show blew me away under ten years. Ratatouille makes you sympathize with the rats, only a genius can do that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar Redeems Itself with Ratatouille,"Ratatouille reviewed by Samuel OsbornLast year, when penning out the review for Pixar's last film, Cars, I wrote, ""Let's decide that this can be Pixar's single use of the Get Out of Jail Free card. Now they're back to square one."" I finished with a suggestion for ""Pixar to go sit in the corner where it can hide beneath its dunce cap."" Well Pixar can come out now, because it has redeemed itself with Ratatouille.Pixar's return path to the throne is led by the likes of a sewer rat named Remy (Patton Oswalt). Remy has a taste for the finer things in life, shunning the scavenged garbage horded by his father and the rat colony. He steals away to the kitchen and the French chef, Gusteau's, cookbook, ""Anyone Can Cook"", whenever possible, sleuthing gourmet cooking in secret. This, however, leads to the rightful owner of the borrowed kitchen discovering Remy red-handed with the cooking utensils. Havoc is wreaked and suddenly a rifle appears, ousting Remy and his rat colony from their country living for good. But in the chaos of evacuation, Remy is separated from his family and marooned off to the city of Paris, popping out of the sewer to arrive at the very restaurant of his most admired chef, Gusteau.Here the tales of Remy the rat and Linguini the garbage boy (Lou Romano) intertwine. On Linguini's first day at Gusteau's, he collides with the soup pot, sloshing half of it to the ground. Before any of the chefs notice, he starts refilling the pot with any and every ingredient within reach. Admiring the kitchen from his minute, mouse-sized hiding place, Remy witnesses Linguni's frankensoup. He maneuvers to the scene by means of acrobatic rodent scurrying and puts his culinary instincts to work. It isn't long before Linguini notices, watching as Remy dices at vegetables and tears at the herbs, sprinkling them with zeal into the now delicious soup. An idea is hatched between the two after the night is through. If Remy could somehow cook for Linguini in secret, then Remy could play out his dream of becoming a gourmet chef and Linguini could hold his job.Of course, as when Mr. Incredible attempted to relive the superhero glory days in secret, hiding a sewer rat in the confines of a gourmet kitchen is no easy task. Though Mr. Incredible was dealing with much more weighty circumstances for an animated film, which is the limb found lacking in Ratatouille. The Incredibles, the animated benchmark in mastery and Writer/Director Brad Bird's first attempt with Pixar, handled more solemn themes than the chasing of one's dreams. Its characters juggled middle-aged crises and marital boredom. They felt trapped by a beaming postcard family. Such themes appeared in Little Children, where adultery and sexual catharsis reigned king. But Mr. Bird managed to channel such discontent into a whirling, comic book world of superheroes. The colors, adorable animation, and Oscar-winning sound jostled the little audiences into soaring contentment, while the adults were offered an honest, smart story to sink into. Ratatouille isn't lacking in either of these categories, as the animation is as adorable as ever, the sound as bombastically rousing as before, and the story clever and humble. But it's the maturity of its themes that's absent. This isn't a middle-aged crisis; this is a rat playing puppeteer to a freckled teenage chef.But disappointment over Ratatouille not surpassing the likes of the best in animated film-making is hardly a criticism at all. It very nearly is a compliment. Mr. Bird has proved that he has a supreme knack for finding the animated in the droll. Ratatouille could very easily be filmed using live-action counterparts. Think Garfield in the kitchenick. But by dreaming up the entire affair through the computed neurons of CGI animation, a liveliness is achieved that would otherwise be ignored. Mr. Bird has made rats adorable and French cuisine not annoyingly pretentious. Such feats are magnanimous. And along the way he managed to tell a warm tale of friendship, romance (not between the rat and the boy, mind you), and the joy of cooking.-Samuel Osborn",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Few Words From My Mind,"Guys....... girls........ everyone in particular, who liked Ratatouille, I just have a few things to say.THAT MOVIE WAS EXCELLENT!!!!!!The casting? Perfect!!Funny? HILARIOUS!!! XDIT WAS THE BEST Disney/PIXAR COLLABORATION THAT I HAVE SEEN IN ALL OF MY LIFE!!!!! ^_^ I totally hope it is worthy of winning a few or a lot of Oscars. Who knows: maybe it might actually be the first animated movie to be nominated for an Academy Award in Best picture since Beauty and the Beast. I didn't originally say that, but the guy who DID say it, I agree 100 percent with him! XD All in all, I love this movie, and it's completely, amazingly, deliciously...... PERFECTO AND MAGNIFIQUE!!!! It gets a ten out of ten on my scale! I wish I could give it more stars, because if I could, I'd give it a trillion!!! ^_^ Don't be an idiot; see the movie! You'll love it! ;)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Is this a Cars bash-fest, or what?","I haven't seen Ratatouille yet, but I'm sure I'll enjoy it. Just like I enjoyed Cars. I really fail to see, from reading the reviews, what makes Ratatouille so much better than Cars, and what makes Cars such a gosh-darn ""dismal disaster"" as one reviewer puts it. I know that this is not the place to plug Cars, but for heaven's sake. Whenever I find myself mourning America's slower, simpler past, I think of Cars and its soundtrack and the beautiful way the film evokes a bygone era.I think a lot of people just weren't able to relate to the talking cars, and therefore didn't get the movie, so they feel a need to cut it down.

One of the most original films I've seen in years,"I entered the theater for ""Ratatouille"" hungry. Yeah, my stomach sort of was craving that buttery, salty, hydrogenated fatty taste of popcorn. But aside that--I was hungry for a fantastic animated film that has been absolutely raved upon by distinguished critics and average moviegoers alike. Hungry just like a food critic is about fine French cuisine.Mmm, and did I leave the theater full of what I wanted (not only the popcorn!) Quite bluntly, ""Ratatouille"" is one of the most original films I've seen in recent memory, and also one of the best movies so far of 2007.The film deals with a rat named Remey living in the French suburbs. Remey isn't any ordinary rat...unlike the tastes of garbage which his family and friends crave, Remey wants REAL food...human food, as he initially calls it. When he and his family are kicked out of this quaint town, Remey finds himself in Paris, with a new friend called Linguini, a human, who is the pimply-faced teenaged janitor for a highly regarded classy 5-star French restaurant.The problem is, Linguini wants to be a chef. And since Remey knows how to cook (and damn well) he teams with Linguini by hiding under his chef hat, controlling his actions (by pulling on his hair) to create the best food in Paris.Hilarity ensues. Truly, I expected nothing less from master filmmaker Brad Bird, who brought us The Incredibles, and some of the early days of The Simpsons. The directing is very well-done, the screenplay is superior, and the voice talent is absolutely BRILLIANT. Peter O'Toole plays the hungry, evil, most cynical food critic around and executes the role seamlessly (and painfully funny too, if you're familiar with his other work as I am!) Sometimes absolutely hysterical, sometimes the ""awwwh"" moment of feeling sorry for someone, sometimes downright absurd--like fine food, it's got something for everyone. I saw it with my little brother, who happens to be six years old, and the movie was silly enough to keep him entertained and sophisticated enough to keep me and my dad laughing throughout.Ratatouille is indeed worth all the hype it's collected in the month it's been released. See it on the big screen before it leaves theaters for good--and then you'll see this one at the Academy Awards!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Tasty cuisine,"Ratatouille is on e of the better animated features to come along in some time. There is plenty of innovation, humor, creativity, and a unique story to make this one a tasty delicacy.A little rate named Remy aspires to more than the routing blasé life he leads in the sewers of Paris. He reads up (hey, of course rats can read in animated movies!) on the writings of a renowned chef, the late Chef Gusteau. Through some odd acts of fate, he comes to the aid of a bumbling trashman at Gusteau's restaurant, and a series of adventures begins. The movie does a great job at establishing the way things work in the 5-Star restaurant world, and just what the characters are up against. Insights into the aspirations of the principals is done well too.The characters are all likable and developed extremely well in minimal time, and the voice talents are all in top form (my personal favorite was the totally unrecognizable Jeanean Garafalo doing a fast jabbering French accented Collette). Character arcs are believable even in the midst of this wild fantasy story.Clever plot twists and a very touching conclusion. Well executed and very entertaining movie with a lot of heart.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Ah, Paris.","'Ratatouille (2007)' tells the tale of a young rat with a refined nose and penchant for cooking who becomes involved with a hapless accidental chef when the pair realise that the former can puppeteer the latter by pulling his hair. The film isn't as silly as its premise may, perhaps, suggest. In fact, it brings with it a certain kind of realism - similar to the grounded vibe of Bird's other Pixar presentation, 'The Incredibles (2004)'. It's an enjoyable film that stays focused on character right the way through, presenting its anthropomorphised animals with as much sincerity and nuance as its humans. That's why it works as well as it does, really. It sticks pretty closely to standard story structure, but it hits the beats it needs to with aplomb and also includes a few surprising consequences for some of its more outlandish actions (something that's often overlooked in similar fare). It's also just a generally pleasant experience packed with energetic animation and appealing character designs. It's a well-written animated adventure that's perfect for the whole family. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar did it again!,"Animation of this film is brilliant. So great that at the end of the credits, they actually inserted a disclaimer saying ""100% genuine animation, no motion capture was used."" !! Somehow they manged to create believable animation without making it look CG - and that goes for both human characters as well as the rats.The overall look of the whole film has this a dreamy soft look to it that equals to the romantic Paris that one would associate. Pixar made everything look real and believable that often times I would forget I am watching an animated feature.The food rendering are simply amazing. If there is a 3D version of the film, I am sure I would reach out to grab the food.I have been disappointed with the three films that came out earlier in the year (Shrek, Pirates, Spiderman - interestingly they are all part 3 of a threequel.)But now finally a great film for the summer.

Animated Celebration of the Transformative Power of Food,"Saw this movie at a drive in base on a recommendation on the cartoonbrew blog. First time I'd been to a drive in in 10 years and it was a nice experience. The second movie on the bill was Evan Almighty and I didn't bother to stay for that one since the reviews here have been bad. Here are my thoughts on Ratatouille: Excellent animation, nice story without the focus-group-topical-jokes, and they got the food right. Not quite the genius of The Triplets of Belleville but still a great movie. It would be interesting to show both movies back to back as they both use animation and food in contrasting ways. It's sad that many theaters showing this animated celebration of the transformative power of food are putting artificial butter flavor on the popcorn and serving chocolate laced with vanilla.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Second best movie of 2007 so far,"Only Waitress was a better film overall for me as it was real people, but Ratty was close, and both were great. Both were so original, inspired, visual, great stories, well acted, funny....all the good things that make us know movies can still can be great. Disney struck gold when Jobs sold it Pixar...the gift that just keeps on giving. Great entertainment to us, bags of money to Disney.What great voices, especially notable was Peter O'Toole as villain-turned-good guy Anton Ego..... he was perfectly egotistical and snobby as a scary food critic. The story...who doesn't like food? The inner workings of a busy French kitchen was fun and interesting. The animation showed continued tech improvement as nuances and shadings and physical movements are getting so much better and more realistic with tech advances. God is in the details in animation, that's for sure.Loved it throughout, if you could overlook all the kid chaos and noise in the theater on the first day. Any lesser film would have been disturbed by the incredible din. Everyone loved it, with much applause at the end.Do yourself a favor and see it in a theater. See the vast improvements in animation and color, but not just for that...see it for the great and touching story of a rat that appreciated great food over the garbage his friends and family liked, and due to that love he made sure he became a part of the haute cuisine world forever.We are all better off for it.See Waitress and Once also, if you haven't. All three are terrific films, and prove that summer fare doesn't have to be lame.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
My favorite animated movie of all time,"I love everything about this movie.

Has some to offer,"I base this upon the 2-Disc Special Edition. This definitely does a thing or two differently than other 3D flicks... as an example, instead of doing tricks for the audience with camera and animation, it feels more like a movie that happens to be all CG. The movements are very realistic, and in a lot of ways, this actually doesn't strain credulity. That's, of course, not counting the main concept. Why must Hollywood always oversimplify psychology and the complexity of the human brain? Also, am I the only one whose had enough of critics being regarded as bitter and crusty old jerks who just like to pick apart the work of others? People, if their judgments bother you that much, *stop listening to them*, it's not a difficult thing to do. The plot is OK, though it doesn't all make sense. Voice acting is marvelous, everyone sounds exactly right. The characters are well-written, they come off as people that could exist outside of fiction, and few are annoying. This is visually well-done, immense level of detail, and grand, vivid color and lighting. The romance feels tacked on, and in fact Linguini is dangerously close to being completely useless in this. I don't really find this funny, however, someone put forth that it's really a drama for kids to a greater extent than a comedy, which I largely agree with. It often tries too hard for laughs when it does go for such. There is intensity and potentially disturbing content in this, as well as one use of a moderately strong word. The DVD comes with Lifted and Your Friend the Rat, the shorts(that I will review on their individual pages) several well-done featurettes, a handful of deleted scenes(in early stages) and some trailers. I recommend this to fans of these films. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
tasty treat,"The late Auguste Gusteau was the best chef in Paris. He wrote a cooking book for everyone which is dismissed by snooty food critic Anton Ego. Remy (Patton Oswalt) is a rat with impeccable tastes. He is also dismissed by his patriarchal father until he is discovered to be able to taste for poison. He becomes the clan's poison detector. He is still unhappy with eating garbage. After stealing the Gusteau cookbook, he gets separated from the family and arrives at late Gusteau's failing restaurant in Paris. Linguini is the new garbage boy. Linguini ruins the soup and Remy fixes it to new heights for a critic. Linguini is given the credit. With Remy's help, the garbage boy becomes one of the best chef in the kitchen. Skinner was Gusteau's sous chef and is the beneficiary in his will except Linguini may be Gusteau's love child.Brad Bird and company have cooked up a nice stew of traditional animated fare. Remy is an appealing protagonist. The message is good. The animation is impeccable. Pixar delivers something very traditional from a less than traditional source. The only change I would do is have Remy wash his hands more. There is an aversion to rats when dealing with food. The movie needs to alleviate some of that hesitation. After all, Remy goes everywhere including the sewer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A huge disappointment - It made my girlfriend cry,"I am in disbelief of the comments left for this film. How anyone could consider this to be Pixars greatest achievement let alone the greatest animated film of all time shocks me. There is no denying the technical achievement that this film represents, however the reason for any film should be the storyline. Throughout the film I was checking my watch to see when it would finish, as the poor plot and unbelievable characters did nothing to draw me in. One of Pixars finest abilities is to create a film for children that appeals to adults humour as well. This was probably the least funniest Pixar film I have had the misfortune of seeing and can only see any humour in the pretentious reviews written by so called 'art types'. Not the worst film I have every seen but in no way what so ever a classic of any type.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

awesome,"Out of all my reviews I have done for IMDb, this is the one review i'm most happy to be typing right now. If you are reading this, I can't tell you enough to go see this movie. It's that good. Easily one of the best, if not the best Pixar film to date. Animation is awesome, script is awesome, scenery is awesome. Not only that, but it really benefits from being on a big screen too. Voice acting is great, not to mention the casting. Good on ya. They really chose the right actors for the job. Never are you distracted with that annoying feeling that you heard that voice before. (i.e Woody Allen as an ant.) Personally what I really appreciated most about this movie was that they truly made a family film, a film every age can enjoy. I always felt that with ""Cars"", even though a great film, wasn't made for adults. Just look at all the toys and products that had Lightning McQueen's face on them and you will see what I mean. This film has an off-beat, yet adult story of a young chef/rat trying to make it as a cook. It deals with bad bosses, relationships with co-workers, and job stress. In fact you replace the rats with kids from a rough neighborhood, and you have a drama/comedy about class struggle. The fact is, this was a film about real life (minus cooking rats). Not a cute story about a world run by talking cars. If I had to nitpick. And it really would be nitpicking. I would have to say that the film felt about 15 minutes too long. Also the basic story formula was familiar movie territory. Fish-out-of-water mixed with a pseudo-Cyrano de Bergerac story. It worked, but I was very aware of what I was watching. The evil chef sorta felt like Dean Wormer from Animal House. Thats all. Just little things here and there sometimes felt very familiar. I will say this. I am proud of Pixar for maturing in their storytelling. I was starting to notice that every film by them was a rescue story, again! Thank you for not making another. It is a welcome change. Also, to it's credit, Ratatouille was not nearly as gaggy as the earlier Pixar releases. Instead they relied more on clever facial expressions and situation comedy. Plus gags, when present, were more visual. Nothing like the stupid one-liners, i.e ""find a happy place"" in other Pixar films. (Hey it's a fish that needs therapy, yuk yuk!) I'll say this, Pixar used to really emphasize the novelty aspect of computer animation. It seemed like they use to make a game out of reproducing cheese puffs, or toy packaging, or making sea turtles into stoners. This was getting old for me. I really enjoyed the change of pace in Ratatouille. Lush scenery, realistically detailed rats and objects, and perfectly rendered lighting. Very impressive. I wouldn't be surprised if this won for best animated feature at next years Oscars. Well done!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Freakin Awesome,"Well, I know there has been a lot of controversy about Ratatouille being on the top 250 movies of all time.

It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be, but in some places it was definitely funny. Some people said on the message boards: ""I don't know why people said it was funny, I didn't laugh, and not one person in the theater did either."" Well I don't know what movie they were watching, but it wasn't Ratatouille! Next to The Incredibles this is one of the best Pixar films yet. A GREAT movie for the family.

Thank God for Pixar's team!,"John Lassiter has created what has become THE clearinghouse for original story ideas extremely well-executed on the screen with outstanding animation. This film is no exception and continues to exemplify the quality that this collection of artists brings the world of family entertainment. I am so very grateful that Bob Iger managed to patch things up between Disney and Pixar, for to lose such a remarkable source of creativity and artistic talent would have been a sin on a level to cause Uncle Walt to bellow from the heavens. There are others (Dreamworks) who are providing quality family animation entertainment, but none on a level equal to Pixar. With all that said, let me simply say this: if you enjoy good story-telling, well-crafted characters, eye-popping animation, and a movie that the entire family (minus those who may have a rodent phobia) can enjoy, then by all means go and see this work of art.

"Not without a charm, but lacking depth","I first saw this film back in 2007 when it just came out in the movie theaters. Back then i hadn't seen The Incredibles or Toy Story yet, so it's no wonder that Ratatouille seemed like a breath of fresh air, something new, vivid and inspiring. There was simply no much competition in the field those days, except for Shrek maybe, which had already passed its peak by that time. And now, eight years later, Ratatouille and i got a chance to meet again.The times have certainly changed since then. Plus, now we have some new prominent examples of fine animation like Kung Fu Panda or How to Train Your Dragon. And while ignorance is indeed bliss, knowledge makes you re-evaluate certain things, and your cinematic experiences are not immune to that.The most important thing that's literally screaming at you from the screen is how goofy and childish this film is. Of course, all the animation movies try to be appealing to the kids so some goofiness can't be helped. But Ratatouille wholeheartedly embraces the buffoonery, trying to turn it into the film's major source of charm and the main selling point. And while France had its history of brilliant and lovable clowns like Louis de Funès or Pierre Richard, Ratatouille fails to reproduce that fine balance of hysterical and touching that made those actors and films they starred in so different.But all that clowning around could be easily forgiven if Pixar hadn't missed the spot with the dramatic angle. The most intense and emotionally saturated animation films these days inevitably revolve around the topic of coming of age. That genre is dearly beloved by me because there's nothing as mind-blowing and revealing and literally touching you to the very core as the process of transformation from an adolescent into an adult. It's something relevant to everyone, and a film that truly resonates with the kids' current feelings and is able to bring the memories of those feelings in the adults has a chance at being a true epiphany, a family-binding moment of sincerity and understanding that matters so much in the world of today when the fast pace of life drives generations further and further apart.Here we had not one but two struggling heroes in existential crisis. Remy, a brilliant rat chef, is torn between his rat's nature, which his family never misses a chance to impose on him, and his humanly passion for cooking. And Linguini, a loser kid trying his best not to screw up for once and outgrow the shadows of the father figures he's been surrounded with.Unfortunately, in Ratatouille the whole sub-plot of that transformation of personality is wrapped up so abruptly that it seems as if no transformation has occurred at all. Both Remy and Linguini fight for their freedom to be themselves and to do what they love without being told what to do by someone else, however, they both end up dependent on each other and ultimately not free at all. And their act of liberation that was supposed to change everything ends up being nothing but a deus ex machina device when the world suddenly decides that it's not gonna interfere anymore. Compare it to the culmination of the same Kung Fu Panda and you'll understand why some movies give you that goosebumpy cathartic feeling while others slide past you with no aftertaste at all.Ratatouille is by no means a bad film. It has enough kindness and charm to make the time you spend watching it enjoyable. However, the tone it speaks to you at the end is pretty much the same as what the film started with, and that lack of maturity makes it rather forgettable in a long run.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
PIXAR Goes 8 for 8!,"I am a viewer with a purpose. If the story fails to impress, I find myself yawning half way through. I don't care how much stuff you blow up. Story ain't there, don't bother.But, with PIXAR, you feel like you are watching an original unfold before your eyes. Maybe it is contrived, but I usually compare PIXAR with the original Walt Disney Studios with their storytelling techniques and ability to create wonderful full characters you care about. Then it has dawned on me that sometime in there Disney referenced Brothers Grimm, JM Barrie and others. Whereas PIXAR comes up with new intriguing stories that have never been in a picture book to my knowledge.The story is simple: Remy is a rat, Remy is a great chef with a nose for ingredients, Remy finds Alfredo, a chef who cannot cook, and Voila! a wonderful plot is born. Remy cooks under Alfredos hat by pulling strands of hair. Before too long our young and little chefs are the toast of Paris.Where this all gets complicated is this: How often do you welcome a Rat in your kitchen? Much less MANY RATS? Fish out of water, rat in kitchen. But where most of us would vomit Remy warms you and by the end you are cheering for his recipes and technique. Voiced by a very funny Paton Oswalt (Comedians of Comedy) he is recognizable and solid. Oswalt has wonderful timing and a timbre in his voice that is just REMY. No getting around it folks, you are rooting for a RAT.The supporting players are wonderful, and wonderfully created by those ingenious artists at Pixar. My favorite however was the delightful Peter O'Toole as Alton Ego, the snobiest yet endearing critic in all of Paris. His study that of a coffin, his typewriter looks like a skull, yet you get him in a way that calls to the food snob in us all.The visuals are also stunning, superb and brilliant. The movie a feast for your eyes and I dare anyone to leave the theatre not craving a bite or two afterwards. The richness in detail of copper pots, wafting vapors, heck even all the splendid fruits and veggies in the food locker are enough to make your mouth water. Brad Bird at the helm, a wonderful story, it was a great night out with a 3 and 4 year old. I fully recommend to all families!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Boiling over with humor, visual beauty and food for thought","Those wildly creative folks at Pixar have done it again with ""Ratatouille,"" a funny and sophisticated movie about Remy, a rat with an unusually well-developed palate. After getting separated from his provincial (or should that be Provençal?) colony, Remy ends up in Paris, where he takes it upon himself to save the renowned Gusteau's Restaurant from a villainous owner, a fearsome food critic, and an inept busboy named Linguini, who mistakenly believes that he can cook. Remy and Linguini enter into a ""Cyrano""-type partnership, Remy providing the recipes and Linguini the human face, while dodging all those people who don't think a rat in the kitchen is so appetizing.Remy is cute and appealing, but also has a fully developed, human-like personality. You are never in doubt that Linguini is Remy's sidekick, and not the other way around. Also, thank goodness, the movie doesn't make Remy able to talk to humans, which would be far too twee. Remy can communicate only with his fellow ratsunfortunately, none of them understand his ambitions.Still, the story of ""Ratatouille"" doesn't seem quite as tight as in other Pixar movies like ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Toy Story."" Those movies had one central objective (get Nemo back home/get the toys back home) and culminated in a thrilling action sequence. ""Ratatouille"" has more, smaller conflicts, and plenty of action throughout, but it doesn't build in the same way. Also, ""Nemo"" and ""Toy Story"" are told entirely from the perspective of the toys or fish; ""Ratatouille"" switches between the rats' perspective and the humans', and the seams show a little.All of the action sequences look fantastic, though: my favorite is a chase scene alongside the Seine, which captures Paris in amazing detail. Indeed, the movie's backgrounds are jaw- droppingly photorealistic. Pixar is also getting better and better at animating humansthere is great physical comedy when Linguini gets drunk and when he has Remy running around inside his shirt. ""Ratatouille"" has a consistently great sense of humor, with puns, amusing character interactions, vocal performances, physical action, and throwaway visual gags all contributing. My favorite character voice comes from Peter O'Toole as food critic Anton Ego. Monsieur Ego also provides one of the best visual jokes, with his skull-shaped typewriter.What really distinguishes ""Ratatouille,"" though, is its larger theme. Remy is kind of a loner, and that's rare for the hero of a kids' movie. Usually, a loner exists in these types of movies only so he can learn the lesson ""You can't succeed without friends."" Though this applies to Remy as well (actually, he knows from the start that as a rat, he'll need special help to realize his dreams), the real message of ""Ratatouille"" is about uncompromisingly pursuing excellence and teaching others to appreciate itabout leading a community rather than simply belonging to it. Let's hope that Pixar, too, can continue to take the lead in upping the standards of computer animation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Good actors like Brad Garret and Janane Garofalo were in one horrible movie. I didn't even smile in that movie.

Ratatouille is a Dish Best Served Fun,"It amazes me just how ingenious the men and women of Pixar can be with the trickiest of material. Every film made is both a technical marvel and a festival of fun, the perfect marriage of art and entertainment. And just when you think they've bitten off more than they can chew, they introduce Ratatouille (pronounced Rat-a-too-ee), their most ambitions and most delicious film yet. Directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles), the film not only exceeds expectations, but also raises the ante for all animated films period.The bottom line on this film is this; Ratatouille is a masterpiece. It perfectly maintains both the fairy tale and the reality of the situation all the way its satisfactory ending. Yes, Remy can walk upright, use his front paws to cook (and he does wash up before touching the food), but he also has to maneuver around the health inspector who wouldn't appreciate a rat chef, no matter how clean he his. The characters are multi-dimensional, exciting, and intriguing. The film is fearless to do thing that other animated films are afraid to do, such as putting such complex themes into what most people would consider to be a kid's movie.On the technical side, this has to be one of the most beautiful animated features made, ranking beside Finding Nemo. The colors are warm and alive. The digital sets are scaled very well. This is important since size plays a major factor. We will have to see the same things in the kitchen from both a rat and human perspective. And for the first time, water effects look natural, especially with characters that are covered in fur.Normally voice acting is usually noticed because of the huge celebrities involved. After the lazy voice acting in the latest Shrek movie, I was hesitant. But the voice talents here are not well-known people, but they were the perfect choices. Patton Oswalt is amazing as Remy, making him both funny and vulnerable. Peter O'Toole oozes with evil delight as Anton Ego, but is also shows the soft side of a hard critic. Ian Holm rarely gets attention for his range in voice acting, but with Skinner he does wonders. But when it comes to great voice acting, I have to talk about Janeane Garofalo, whom I didn't even recognize her voice at any time. And yet she gives Colette a razor-sharp wit and resiliency that is very much a part of her own personality.All in all, this is one of the best films of 2007, if not the best. I can't think of a better summer movie for the whole family. But go hungry, you might find yourself wanting something French afterwards, and I hardly think it will be fries.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
PIXAR at its delicious best!,"It is usual to expect PIXAR Animation Studios to churn out meaningful animation entertainers. Once again they have cemented this belief, by presenting RATATOUILLE (pronounced RAT-A-TOO-EE).RATATOUILLE trailers were first showcased during PIXAR's previous CARS shows in cinemas. This did generate the interest in this venture among the film goers. The first word remark about the movie -> FUNTASTIC!PIXAR Animation Studio seems to be getting better at animation technology, with the 'world' in its films' canvas closer to the actual world. Adding to this technical brilliance, the characterization and handling of the emotions, which has been a forte of both PIXAR and Walt Disney Pictures makes this movie, as I see it, a better one than its predecessor CARS. CARS, though a brilliant work of imagination, did not connect with me as much as RATATOUILLE due to its lack of the 'HUMAN' factor. But with RATATOUILLE, it is the perfect combination of IMAGINATION, EMOTIONS, MESSAGE, and CHARACTERIZATION that makes it for me a better fare than the splendid CARS.I am not going to talk about the plot or its characters. It is a thing to be experienced. I am blogging this to express my astonishment and excitement over the animation film. Some people have dubbed it, without watching the film, as an 'Animation film for the children'. Trust me, its not. It's for everyone. This is one more feather in PIXAR's hat, having made a genre that was thought to be for the children reach out to all age groups.This week, if you have decided to watch a movie, watch RATATOUILLE, at a cinema near you. If it's not running at a cinema near your place, wait till November 2007 to buy the original DVD and watch it. But make sure, YOU WATCH THIS ONE..",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Animation masterpiece,"Remy, an apparently ordinary rat who lives with his pack in a remote house, discovers that he has an extraordinary gift. He is able to smell all flavors and poisons, thus becoming very useful for his kind, but this new ability also comes with a lot of curiosity regarding food and cooking. This curiosity, bound to get him in trouble, ultimately sends him to Paris where it was thought that anybody can cook. There, he teams up with a very odd human with a ""special"" life of his own, in an attempt to prove his extraordinary abilities. He has a lot of work to do and many obstacles to overcome but his determination and skill will help him in many difficult situations.It's a superb animation which presents a beautiful, interesting and suspenseful life story which ultimately ends with style besides all problems the main characters have to face.

"an average movie for kids, with a nice French touch","Ratatouille is a lighthearted animated film that is enjoyable for kids and families. Set in the romantic streets of Paris, it tells the story of a rat named Remy who dreams of becoming a chef in a high-end restaurant. The film has some charming elements, particularly its vibrant depiction of French culture, food, and the bustling city of Paris. However, while the movie is visually pleasing and has a cute storyline, it does feel rather average overall.The plot is predictable, and while the animation is colorful and well-done, it doesn't quite stand out compared to other Pixar classics. For those who enjoy France and the culinary world, there are some delightful moments, but it lacks the depth or emotional impact that would make it memorable for older audiences.Overall, ratatouille is a decent watch, particularly for kids or anyone with a love for French culture, but it's not a standout in the world of animated films.

It was OK.,"I go to the movie theater hoping to see another CRAPPY Disney movie that I'll regret seeing. But I got opposite of what i expected. Here's what I first thought of Ratatouille:1) A rat cooking? Are you *BEEPING* KIDDING ME??!! WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON IN THIS WORLD????!!! Sounds *BEEPING* unsanitary if you ask me.2)Oh crap...another horrible Disney movie that my 5 year old sister wants to watch.3)I really hate Disney!!!!! I wonder if Walt Disney himself is tossing turning in his grave.Now that I saw it here's how I feel now:1)The loud sounds at the cinema gave me a extremely painful headache.2)At least the rat (I forgot his name) washed his hands first. (THANK GOD!!!!!)3)Great artwork on the the backgrounds.4)That kid who the rat helps in the movie kinda reminds me of Napoleon Dynamite.5)The movie was OK. I just don't see what the big deal is.6)The score in this battles of the media is, Me:0 and Disney:1. (Disney got a point because I didn't leave the theater saying, ""I saw another bad Disney movie."")7)This movie gets a 4 out 10.8)Don't u just hate it when u see drunk characters in a kids movie?9)I'm sorry if I'm SO harsh on Disney, it's just their live-action movies that ""really grinds my gears.""",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Pixar's done it again,"You know Pixar has never disappointed me. I've loved everything they've made and I've always thought them to be the current gods of animation. Last year they brought us Cars which was great but did not really give me the same Pixar feel. By that I mean that out of all Pixar films Cars was my least favorite with The Incredibles being my top favorite. Pixar movies are always a treat and this year's slice of cake is Ratatouille (thats rat-a-too-ee). Ratatouille is the story of a rat who teams up with a garbage boy to become the greatest chef in Paris. But I don't want to dwell in the story so lets just say its got the Pixar seal of approval.The voice acting was all done very well considering that Linguini's voice actor is actually an animator for Pixar. You have your standard John Ratzenberger and I especially liked Peter O'Toole's role as ultra food critic Anton Ego (who was actually designed to resemble a vulture) and Patton Oswalt's portrayal of the titular character Remy the rat. In this day and age of film making there are no longer many advances in sound effects other than stuff sounding closer, further, muffled or echoy so I'll just say they were well done as well. The music captured the mood and thankfully avoided the CGI animation cliché of resorting to pop culture references and music to get a cheap laugh from the crowd (I'm looking at you Shrek).All that stuff is great but what really had me loving this movie was the same thing that had me loving every other Pixar film which is the looks. Simply put this movie is gorgeous... no its not gorgeous is beautiful... no its gorgeously beautiful. The lighting, the reflections, the water effects, the clothes effects the textures the character expressions and looks, every tiny little thing to make this world which just so happens to be our world come alive. Another noteworthy thing to point out is the way the film exemplifies Paris to bring out it's life. There were many a time during the film when the city was seen from a vantage point to show just how beautiful it is. Therefore beautiful Pixar animation added onto the most beautiful city in the world equals nothing short of true art.So yeah I loved the movie, but was there anything wrong with the movie? Well I can only say the movie was TOO good considering that I viewed it one week after its release and the theater was filled with people during an afternoon showing and there were kids behind me who wouldn't stop talking until their dad moved them to the front of the theater thankfully allowing me to enjoy the rest of the film.So there was nothing wrong with the movie itself and even the Pixar short ""Lifted"" had me glued to the screen. 10/10 Pixar's done it again",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Rat's Story,"Rats are a hard sell. They're filthy little rodents with fierce, ugly teeth that scurry across your feet when you aren't expecting anything, dragging their long, scaly tails behind them and sending those they cross into squeals of fear. Rats in a kitchen comedy are arguably an impossible sell. If you don't like rats to begin with, you certainly don't want them anywhere near your food. Yet here we are smack in the middle of the premise for the near infallible Pixar's latest summer crowd pleaser, RATATOUILLE. Separated from his rat colony, Remy (voiced by comedian Patton Oswalt), finds himself accidentally putting his culinary talents to good use in what was once one of Paris' most prestigious kitchens, earning him rave reviews. Of course a rat can't take credit for fine food preparation so he forms an unlikely friendship with a gangly, awkward fellow by the name of Linguini (Lou Romano), who serves as his front. Together they bring new life to an aging restaurant and inspire each other to be better than they believe themselves to be. The folks at Pixar might have been sniffing too many expensive cheeses when they concocted this mousecapade but they may also be the only people out there who could have pulled it off. Only, under the writing and direction of Brad Bird (THE INCREDIBLES), they didn't just pull it off; RATATOUILLE is a masterwork in the field of animated film-making, deliciously reaching heights that no rat has ever reached before.Remy is no ordinary rat. He has a gift, a gift that is being squandered at home. He understands the complicated calibration of cooking. He knows the spice for every occasion yet his overbearing father (Brian Dennehy) uses his heightened senses as a tool to sniff out rat poison amongst the garbage. Like so many of us born into situations that do not lead instantly to fame and fortune, Remy is destined for greatness but has yet to be discovered. Not only does he need to win over the hearts and stomachs of notoriously finicky food critics (like the one voiced so delectably by Peter O'Toole) but he must also win over the potentially lost appetites of modest movie goers who may not want rats with the their popcorn. Bird's animators studied the bahavior of rats extensively and felt it would be best to have the rats walk about like humans, on two feet, in an effort to appear more likable. Bird refused. He wanted the rats to act like rats. He wanted their ideals to win us over. When trapped in a jar early on in the film, it is Remy's charm that gets him set free. There is an earnestness, a yearning, a hope seen deep in his pleading eyes that reminds us just how often we find ourselves trapped in jars by people bent on keeping us down. Besides, aren't we all just rats in the race?Like Remy, Bird and his Pixar cohorts know to add a sprinkling of depth to their dishes and that presentation is key. RATATOUILLE raises the Pixar standard of beauty to new levels while seasoning the whole with hints of meaning that are only completely realized once they hit your palette. Pixar's Paris is a foggy riverside with scattered street lamps at one moment and a string of window lights and fountains the next. While it is romantically distracting, it is nowhere near as chaotic as the view from two inches above the floor. Rats scamper and the camera follows as Remy swerves in and out of kitchen crevasses and sewers (always sure to wash his hands before touching the food). The fluidity of the movement through such luscious colour is hypnotic and mag ical, simply what one would expect from the city of love. Somewhere tucked away in this city is a tiny one-bedroom apartment the size of a storage space known as not much but still home to Linguini. The friendship formed between the man and his rat is unlikely, yes, but it anchors the film with its humbling mutual appreciation. They learn to rely on each other without forgetting how to contribute the most vital parts of themselves. Theirs is a friendship so powerful and so respectful that it changes the minds and hearts of the naysayers who play witness to it, including those sitting comfortably in front of the screen.""Anyone can cook."" These are the words of Chef Gousteau, Remy's inspiration and hero, that run throughout RATATOUILLE. Cooking can be interpreted as anything and therefore anyone can do anything they want. Just look at Remy, a rat with an impossible dream that comes true despite every odd and thanks to hard work (and a dash of fate). Better yet, just look at Pixar. By not simply following the recipe but rather using inspired, unusual ingredients, they have managed to make a mesmerizing masterpiece that is astonishing, endearing and about a rat.GRADE: A",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Stepchild of the Pixar Family,"Like every single one of Pixar's films, this was witty, beautiful and genuine, but in the end it felt like light fare compared to some of the studio's masterworks.

The script had a few legit family-friendly laughs and the animation had some moments of inspiration, (I really liked the visualizations of competing/combining flavors, for example) and it gets points for trying out a unique setting but this never really had that moment where everything shifted into overdrive.

Fun Realism for a Cartoon,"Generally, I don't like animation. But this is so realistic, and the characters (voices) can be very funny.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
A rat who is an exceptional chef ... yes, that's a unique story. You could argue that being an animation means
you don't have to have a good story, but I disagree - animation or not, we always require good story for good film.If this was done with people I'm not sure it would be half as good (if even possible). So the realism here allows
for an engaging story that expresses itself in some very touching ways (almost human).And it's very funny.ACTING:
The ""acting"" is good, but the lead character was so real ... almost like the film ""Tron"" (1982) that he was a marvel
to watch. Very nice ""cast"" though somewhat cliched.ENTERTAINMENT:

A deeply lovable protagonist.,"This film tells the story of Remy, a rat who want to cook. In order to do so, he decides to ally with a young but incompetent cook. Directed by Jan Pinkava and Brad Bird, which also provides the script, it has voice actors like Brad Garrett, Peter O'Toole and Patton Oswalt.This film is good, but it would have never been able to stand out without its adorable protagonist. The script works well, but is more complex than usual in children's films, which makes it more appealing to older audiences (from nine or ten years). The voice actors are good and have done a work without errors, as well as the animators, who filled with realism each scene. Designed for fun, it doesn't seek to convey great moral maxims and has scenes able to get the audience to tears of laughter. The soundtrack fulfills her role without stand out.Fun in the ideal measure, a little more adult than usual, original and captivating, this film will probably stay in the memory for having one of the most visually lovable characters of modern animated films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Unique & funny computer animated film...,"1st watched 11/28/2008, - (Dir-Brad Bird): Unique & funny computer animated film from Brad Bird & Pixar again takes us to worlds rarely seen. This time it's the world of rats and more precisely a rat who wants to be a cook and create instead of steal like most of the rats do. This breaking out of the nest philosophy isn't unique in films, especially animated movies, but a rat that wants to be a cook is. Humans usually shriek when rats are near food or call the health inspectors but Bird brings us one who not only touches food but makes it wonderfully tasty with it's touch. Bird uses wonderful camera positions to make us feel like we're looking from the rats point of view. This incredible animation along with a very unique story made for an enjoyable movie-going experience. I've basically already outlined the main story but also involved as the patsy or puppet human is a young man who wants to cook but doesn't have the knack for it. He's hired on as a janitor for a world famous restaurant and after botching up the soup recipe he notices a rat putting various ingredients in and the customers love it after his special touch. He's amazed by this and the human gets the credit but he can't duplicate it without the rats help. They scheme together a plan where the rat controls the human through his hat by pulling on his hair to direct him.(OK, so this is a little weird but in animation anything goes) There is a subplot involving the restaurant owner who thinks the boy named Linguini is the original owner's son and is afraid he will inherit the restaurant. This eventually is the case and there are some funny scenes where the owner notices the rats' involvement in the process and others think he is crazy, of course. This is an unusually convoluted plot for an animated movie but this is what makes it enjoyable for adults. Kids will like it too despite this as the movie is an enjoyable experience throughout. Bird & Pixar keep kicking out new material that continues to surprise and they probably will both be at it for a very long time, god willing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The greatest animated movie ever made.,"Movies don't get much better than this. I watched this a lot as a child but this is not nostalgia; this is a perfect movie. There's a lot that can be said about Pixar as a studio, their ability to blend childlike whimsicality with adult messages, but it is at this point when they made Ratatouille when they peaked. This is the most mature movie they've ever made and it has the best characters, easily the most intriguing, gripping, mesmerizing and stunning story out of any animated movie I've seen thus far and in cinema in general. Brad Bird triumphs on this one and it's most likely he'll never make a movie this good again but very few can make a movie this good in the first place.Remy is a lovable rat who goes on a journey across the most gorgeous landscape in a Pixar film, that being Paris, and discovers how despite barriers in life he can achieve his dreams which sounds cliché and a bit pretentious but it's executed so masterfully in this film. The sentiments of final lines that a good artist can come from anywhere is so brilliant. You really genuinely feel like you are one with the characters and that you go on this journey with them, and when they succeed it feels like you succeed and when they have ups and downs you have ups and downs. This film has expert pacing and we see each character grow with so much depth; we see Remy go from a mere rat who simply aspires to become a chef to someone who learns to let his family and friends into his life and help him to realise his dreams. Along the way we see the family become more open-minded to humans and vice-versa. We see Linguine go from someone who's a nobody, a garbage boy to someone who skyrockets in fame to someone who learns to be more grounded and to accept others, what a brilliant character.It is mind-blowing the amount of genius put into this film, it's like a perfect storm, so brilliantly written. This is something that comes about once in a lifetime and I'm lucky to be able to even see this; I feel honoured.The animation is fantastic but really the art style and the design of Paris is the crown jewel, it is so lush and lovingly crafted, I've never seen anything that looks so passionately beautiful in an animated movie before and I don't know if I ever will again. The food is so well animated so don't watch this film on an empty stomach because you will be very hungry by the end. Oh my and don't even get me started on the score; it's amazing.It really goes without saying at this point for Pixar with the voice acting which is top-notch. Patton Oswalt is perfect in this role and is incredibly lovable as Remy. Lou Romano as Linguini is brilliant and so is everyone really and of course, you've got John Ratzenberger in there. I absolutely love Skinner who is a villain with a genuine motive, he really wants the restaurant back and dislikes Linguini for his immediate rise to power. You've also got this sort of white whale narrative going on where he becomes obsessed with Remy and tries to debunk Linguine. He's also very funny. I love the chefs; I love Horst, he's such an underrated character and Colette is fantastic and I love how she tells the audience about the gender imbalance in the cooking industry.And of course, you have Anton Ego one of the most intriguing and terrifying movie characters in general. With perhaps the best voice acting ever from the legendary Peter O'Toole. His character is so well-crafted and revered and villainous throughout the film (his room is shaped like a coffin as well) that when the final scene of him and his flashback to his childhood hits it's like no other. I felt overcome with a rush of emotion as he drops his pen and realises how great the food is. I don't get that from any movie. That's another thing that this movie can do it makes me all emotional not with sadness not with joy but with love and passion. I just love everything about this film and I will not fault it for anything. It's really hard to put into words how much this movie means to me. I really don't want to spend my time analysing it any further because it is that good and I feel that analysing it is pointless, for me this is art, yeah this is a movie but for me, it's more than that, it's an experience and a journey that sucks you in like no other. It holds on to you as it takes you on a journey through the streets of Paris, you bond with the characters and by the end, you will be rewarded and content.This isn't the funniest Pixar movie nor is it really a comedy at all, this is Pixar taking a very mature approach. This film is really for adults, there are a lot of things and ideas in here that probably wouldn't resonate with kids. It's unlikely we will get another Pixar film this laser-focused in telling a convincing story that just sucks you in. It would seem impossible for Brad Bird to top himself with The Incredibles considering how near-perfect that film is but Ratatouille absolutely blows it out of the water.This movie is pure art to me, I love it, I love it, I love it, I can't say enough good things about it. I love the story and I love the pacing - just absolutely perfect. The characters are beautiful, the landscapes are beautiful, the animation is fantastic, the direction by Brad Bird is unlike any other film I've seen. It makes me happy, it makes me joyous, it makes me feel warm, it makes me feel comfortable and it makes me feel all sorts of emotions. This is Pixar's masterpiece and one of my favourite films ever made.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great Movie,"must watch for movie lovers........In its opening weekend in North America, Ratatouille opened in 3,940 theaters and debuted at No.1 with $47 million,[41] the lowest Pixar opening since A Bug's Life. However, in France, where the film is set, the film broke the record for the biggest debut for an animated film.[42] In the UK, the film debuted at No.1 with sales over £4million.[43] The film has grossed $206,445,654 in the United States and Canada and a total of $623,722,818 worldwide, making it the fifth highest grossing Disney·Pixar film now, just behind Toy Story 3, Finding Nemo, Up and The Incredibles Ratatouille received critical acclaim from critics. On film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Ratatouille has a 96% rating from a sample of 205 reviews,[45] while it has a Metacritic score of 96 based on 37 reviews indicating ""universal acclaim"", which in June 2009 was the seventh-highest of all scores on the website.Ratatouille was nominated for five Oscars including Best Animated Feature Film, which it won. At the time, the film held the record for the greatest number of Oscar nominations for a computer animated feature film, breaking the previous record held by Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo and The Incredibles at four nominations, but tied with Aladdin for any animated film. In 2008, WALL-E surpassed that record with 6 nominations. Now, Ratatouille is tied with Up and Toy Story 3 for animated film with the second greatest number of Oscar nominations. Beauty and the Beast still holds the record for most Oscar nominations (also 6) for an animated feature film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Life-Changing, Mind-Altering Experience","I cannot properly express in words how life changing this cinematic experience was. I feel as though I have seen the light. I have been enlightened, eyes opened. If you have ever come across the age-old question, ""What is the meaning of life?"" and pondered the answer; look no further, for the answer is within this exceptional film. I have truly been changed for the better. It feels like my life truly has meaning for once, as if there is finally a reason for me to be in this plane of existence. I am beyond impressed, beyond fulfilled, and beyond thankful for this incredible movie. I cannot stress enough the significance of watching this movie, for the life changing roller-coaster ride that you will embark on while watching this magnificent art piece is worth every second.

Some parts are brilliant,"Not Pixar's best and I for one love food and cooking.Every movie needs to suspend reality for its audience but this movie seemed to suffer from an uncomfortable case of stage fright. To be sure, an infestation of rats is not the most pleasant subject even in animation. But instead of ignoring this fact, Brad Bird goes to rather painful lengths to explain every minute detail of Remy and Linguini's unusual relationship. The problem is: if you're a child, such explanations are unintelligible and if you're an adult they strain believability and do little to advance the plot or develop the characterization, which are far more important than why Remy doesn't walk on all fours.The kitchen and the sewer are teaming with chefs and rats and trying to keep each character straight let alone appreciate each of their quirks is challenging to say the least. Here again, instead of letting the characters introduce themselves in a memorable fashion, Bird seems intent on spelling it out for the viewer which is neither lasting nor helpful. But most importantly none of the characters are lovable. Let's face it, this is a kids movie that even adults should find palatable but I was as annoyed with Linguini as the top chef and the rest of the staff with his constant psychoanalysis. The only truly memorable character was O'Toole as Anton Ego, perhaps a little over the top but masterfully concluded.Throughout the movie I found myself questioning the direction of the storyline. The beauty of CG is that each scene can be essentially shot and reshot again and again unlike traditional film making. Having watched most of the DVD extras for Toy Story, Monsters, Cars, etc. I know to what extent the Pixar animators tweak each element of the storyboard to make a cohesive whole. However, Ratatouille seems to lack such cohesion. The opening sequence on the farm seems disconnected from the rest of the movie and Ratatouille's conversations with Gusteau is served up as an odd accompaniment throughout.To be sure, the animation is stellar and Pixar raises the bar with each new movie. Apparently, this movie completes a list initially envisioned by the creative think tank at Pixar long before Toy Story and A Bugs' Life. However, in this case the best was not saved for last.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The Pixar dream is over.......,"This was by far the worst movie I have seen since Mystic River. And what is most terrible is that everyone thinks its great, were we watching a different film? Were we watching a cut version where all the good bits were removed? This was terrible!The only redeeming part of this movie was the superb quality of animation which was utterly wasted on a script that has been injected with corny Disney morals. The main characters were so horribly clichéd that I actually began to despise them. And why were all the main characters speaking with American accents in Paris? In one foul swoop this destroyed all the animators efforts to create a feeling of being in France.But the worst part of this abysmal tragedy of film-making was the fact it just wasn't funny. I think I smirked once during the whole thing. The endless slapstick comedy was just infuriating and even the kids were getting bored and restless after the hundredth time someone fell over.Pixar have always been very successful at making films that both adults and children can enjoy whereas this film bored the adults and failed to hold the children's interest. It was an utter failure and it worries me that maybe Disney's new influence may end the wonderful Pixar story way before its time.A sad day for animated film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Ratatouille (2007) One of pixar's best animations,"Pixar has already made several excellent films, among which it is impossible not to mention the great ""Ratatouille"". This film is simple, has a fun story and a beautiful message. The development of the relationship between Linguini and Remy is very interesting, because the film manages to develop both characters without stealing too much screen time from the other, although at certain times the script seems to rush a little. There's no need to mention the film's animation. It's everything you expect from Pixar: Fluid, brilliant animation. The characters are very striking and their look is unique.

Just a thought,"I read through those who gave ratatouille a 1 rating and I feel sorry for them. Because they seem to have not understood the concept of this movie. Yes the movie shows a rat that is good at cooking food but the movie is not about a rat, it is about a someone, who is bound by expectations and culture by friends and family while still wanting to pursue a dream of his own. A dream that seems impossible to achieve because of where he comes from and his culture, but does that stop him? No, he takes his chance, he builds friendships, he gets in to trouble, he does mistakes and he tries to do the right thing at the end. This movie shows moral conflicts and stand points that are so regular and normal that it's truly a mystery that people have succeeded to miss those. Please for your own sake, and your kids sake and other people who might have not watched the movie, at least try to understand the movie before you judge it? A lesson you can learn after watching this movie. :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"A simple, sensitive, exciting original film. A film that gives us valuable lessons of friendship and love, of believing in your dreams, however impossible they may seem","""In a way, the job of a critic is easy. We take little risk and take pleasure in evaluating those who have submitted their work and reputation to us. We gain fame from negative reviews that are fun to write and read. But the stark reality we critics must face is that, on the whole, the simplest crap is perhaps more significant than our biggest criticism. But there are times when a critic actually risks something, such as when he suddenly discovers something new. The world is often hostile to new talent and new creations. The new needs to be encouraged.""Brad Bird is one of the best animation directors in Hollywood. Earlier in his career, he even directed a few episodes of The Simpsons between 1990 and 1991, and with The Iron Giant in 1999 which he directed for Warner, he got good reception in his feature film debut. His next work was his debut on Pixar with the excellent The Incredibles (2004), a film in which he debuted with 3D technology at Pixar Studios and which told the story of a family of superheroes, and which won him his first Oscar for Best Animated Film, with the film still taking home the award for best sound mixing. The film also won several awards, including best director, at the Annie Awards, the Oscar for animation.Ratatouillé is Pixar's newest bet in partnership with Disney and only proves the already recognized quality of the company's productions and the talent of Brad Bird. The script knew how to work a simple story, full of punctual messages that fully reach its target audience: the family, without any restrictions.We observe the wise mix of funny scenes, with more emotional and romantic scenes in an organic way. Through a complex and well-knit script, topics such as family and personal interests, the importance of following a dream and being persistent, of honesty are addressed. Ratatouille is an inexhaustible source of teaching for all ages. The characters are very captivating (from the good guys to the bad guys) and the unfolding of the story fulfills all expectations generated from the first scene. Let's take for example Remy's construction, voiced by Patton Oswalt. First we have to highlight the daring of putting a mouse cooking, something that doesn't go together at all. Just imagining your food being prepared by a rat (no matter how hard it washes its hands) is going against everything we believe in hygiene when we eat out. Remy admires humans for their creativity and the possibilities they have to invent new things and appreciate what's really good, and dreams of somehow taking part in that world through their talent, even though it's seen as a pest. But by no means does Remy abandon the characteristics of a mouse, which is what he is. He loves his family of rats, but he can't stand being torn between his family and his great passion, cooking. Remy doesn't believe in humans as the greatest threat as his father does. At one point he says, ""Change is nature, Dad. The part we can influence. And it starts when we decide..."". Remy was walking away from his father and he asked him where he would go, and Remy replied: ""With luck... I'll go ahead"". Remy becomes one of the friendliest characters of any animation ever produced.Another representation is related to the figure of the critic, here it is gastronomy, but it can be applied to a critic of any profession. Anton Ego, brilliantly voiced by the legend Peter O'Toole, is one of the best characters. Presented at first sight as a usual caricature and can even be considered a villain, being shown living in a huge mansion, sporting a huge picture of himself on the wall that denotes his self-confidence and arrogance. As the film progresses, Anton becomes more human (including a flashback scene from his childhood in his humble home and eating delicious homemade food made by his mother), culminating at the point where Anton arrives and re-evaluates his own life, in one of the best final monologues of a movie ever seen.The other villain in the movie is Skinner (Ian Holm). Since Gusteau's death, he became the restaurant's Chef, and interested in inheriting the place, he tries to get rid of Linguini and find out how he learned to cook so well, but he can't due to the success of the soup made by the boy commanded by the skillful hands of Remy. Although a little caricatured, the character takes part in interesting scenes, such as Remy's pursuit through the streets of Paris, or the one in which he tries to get Linguini drunk to extract information from the boy, or even when he is attacked by rats in the final stretch. He is a really insufferable villain and does well the task of causing anger to those who watch.It's impossible not to talk about the phenomenal quality of the animation, especially with elements so difficult to reproduce in 3D such as fur, smoke, water, and environmental changes in elements such as wind, rain, food texture, among others. Besides, of course, the facial expressions of both rats and human characters. It is worth highlighting the movement of kitchen chefs in the handling of food and in the preparation of dishes. It's mouth-watering to see all those soups, breads, cheeses, meats and, of course, the Ratatouille in the title. Still, it's remarkable how, even in a light story, the seriousness is constantly brought organically back into the plot - as in the beautiful and haunting scene where Remy's father shows him what happens to the rats that get too close to humans. The production design of Harley Jessup, winner of the Annie Awards for the work, faithfully reproduces every detail of a typical French restaurant kitchen, as well as the other environments of the restaurant. But despite most of the scenes taking place in the restaurant, several scenes reproducing Paris attest to the perfectionism of every detail of what we see on screen. We came across historical monuments, details of sidewalks and streets, reproduction of cars, streets, building facades and a panoramic view of the entire city. The indoor and outdoor shots are lovely.The movement of the characters is very detailed and realistic, making everything much more believable. The relationship between humans and animals was treated in a unique way, not forcing dialogues between animals and humans, yet creating a mutual understanding in a unique and universal language. Note that although Linguini and the other humans understood what the rat wanted and vice versa, the rats only ""talked"" to each other, because when they are seen by humans, only animal noises and not words are heard.We must also mention the wonderful soundtrack by Michael Giacchino that passes all the magical atmosphere of Paris and still entertains us at all times. The Oscar-nominated soundtrack grows in moments of chase and action, uses specific instruments in the romantic themes of Linguini and Colette, and entertains in scenes where Linguini is controlled like a puppet by Remy. The lighting and textures are also notorious. The fur of rats, the night lighting of the streets of Paris and the dimness of the sewers, in addition to the sunny and romantic city at other times. Highlight for the scene in which Remy walks through the Parisian underground, until reaching the top of a building where he saw the sign and realizes he is in his idol's restaurant.This new Pixar production alongside Disney Studios is less crowded than previous in-house movies, especially when we compare this one to Brad Bird's previous work The Incredibles. On the other hand, it is better worked on its text, and it still shows agility and good humor. We even overlooked details of how Remy manipulates Linguini hidden in his hat. As strong as Remy had, the moves were always forced, always with the intention of causing laughter in the audience. Brad Bird never gives up fun like any other animation and teaches many essential lessons especially to children.A simple, sensitive, exciting original film, especially in its last half hour, with an unquestionable quality. A film that gives us valuable lessons of friendship and love, of believing in your dreams, however impossible they may seem, that even the humblest can reach great positions if there is willpower, persistence and above all talent for the that it proposes to carry out, and to believe that friendships can come from those we least expect, and the importance of recognizing talent and knowing how important everyone is for the team's success. We can still cite the ending that found a happy, but more realistic and satisfying solution. A must for any age and at any time. Another hit by Disney / Pixar and absolutely deserving of winning the Oscar for Best Animation. It really is a masterpiece of the genre! Before the film, there is a traditional presentation of a short film by the company. This time it's the funny Almost Abducted, directed by Oscar-nominated Gary Rydstrom.""They managed to shake my frame. In the past, I made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gasteau's famous motto: 'Anyone can cook.' But I realize that I'm only now fully understanding what he meant. Become great artists.

Another Pixar classic,"Pixar's original golden age started with 1995' Toy Story and ended with 2004's The Incredibles, given Cars was their first real stinker (it's so much worse than the still pretty good A Bug's Life, and that's a hill I'll die on).With Ratatouille, Pixar's renaissance period begins. This one doesn't last as long as their golden age (thanks to Cars 2, in 2011), but the four films they released from 2007 to 2010 are among some of the best animated movies of all time, period.What more can be said about Ratatouille specially? It's fantastic. The animation still looks great, the setting is wonderful, the music is great, the characters are fun, the pacing is excellent, it takes what sounds (on paper) like a silly premise and really makes it work, and while it's not quite a Pixar tearjerker, it has a good heart and some moments that are quietly moving in their own way.It really is fantastic, and worthy of all the praise it gets, and of the Pixar movies I've rewatched so far this year, I'd say I only like Toy Story 2 and Finding Nemo more than this (both by a hair, really).",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Rats ! In the Kitchen !,"As you read in the summary, (for those of you who haven't seen this film) that is pretty much the tagline for this film, and it works, for the most part, the film definitely has a few flaws.My biggest problem with the film, is that its too long and there is way to much going on. You have all these characters being squeezed in (like all the chefs and the rat characters) and I will be the first to say, that without giving too much away, there are certain plot lines that are just not needed, particularly one about certain characters being related and it did not amount to anything in the end, which pretty much proves that it was pointless.That is a fairly big flaw as I kept checking my phone to check how long the film had left. Also, surprisingly, I felt that, because there are so may different story lines, I felt like I never got to see that much of the characters, I liked Remy and I wanted to see more of him, it is his story. I would have liked to have seen more of Linguini and I feel that the romance he has with Colette was a bit rushed and could have been more developed.However, the film's saving grace is the animation and the atmosphere. The animation is incredible, some of the best I've ever seen. All the scenes that involve a view of the city at night all look like something out of a beautiful painting, I mean I could have stared at it forever. The characters (despite being underdeveloped) are still a lot of fun, the villain is freaking gold and Colette also gets some funny lines in. Remy is a great character and I loved the scenes where he is experimenting with food.I will not dare give away the ending, one of the best endings in film if you ask me, I didn't expect it and it was heart warming. The inner thoughts of the critic (Peter O'Toole) at the end was one of the best movie monologues ever. It was touching, and thought provoking when it comes to judging art or even people.Overall the film has a few problems but the stuff thats good is really good and outways the bad stuff my a long shot.

Not Just a Snack but a Feast,"For this multicourse meal passion is the main ingredient. Something we all strive for shown in something as small as a rat.

But in the end it chasing what we love we are able to truly grow and mature. See the movie not only shows the struggles of chasing your dreams, but to also look after those that cared for you. At the start Remy's entire goal was to just go for cooking despite what his father being against it and his friend wanting him to stay. But once he made it to being a chef and felt lonely he did not have the support of his family. So he did what everyone at that stage does and explained to his family what he does and reconnected with them.Also this movie is just a super fun watch for the kids.

"The Movie, not the dish","There was a rumour doing the rounds a few years back that rats had been observed at some of the larger London cinemas. Apparently they would steal in during the show, prowl the aisles under cover of darkness and vacuum spilt popcorn from around the feet of the punters. Of course this is alarming and of course this is horrible ... and yet after sitting through the latest offering from Pixar (and at a large London cinema to boot), I feel oddly sanguine at the prospect. Among its many, myriad delights, Ratatouille is a film to make you love the rat.And there is no escaping it: Ratatouille's rats are unmistakably ratty. They have snaking tails and skittering claws and rapid heartbeats that make their flanks quiver and their fur tremble. Sometimes they bite. While Brad Bird's film is being distributed by Disney as part of an ongoing deal with Pixar, it's safe to assume that these vermin would never have passed muster during the wholesome heyday of Uncle Walt. In one early scene, an entire horde of them is forcibly flushed out of their nest and the sight is so viscerally shocking that it takes a second to check yourself and realise that, hang on, we're not against these rats, we're on their side. Fortunately, it is only a second.The film's hero is Remy, who would probably not be caught dead eating discarded popcorn in any case. This is because Remy (voiced by US comedian Patton Oswalt) is a culinary genius. He totters on his hind legs to keep his front paws clean and generally conceals the soul of a poet inside the body of an incontinent, disease- riddled rodent. Alighting at a top Paris restaurant, he promptly becomes the puppet-master of Linguini (Lou Romano), a lowly kitchen boy. Installed beneath a chef's hat, the rat communicates his gifts by pulling at Linguini's hair; a complex series of tugs, yanks and passes that has the kid jerking like a marionette from the oregano to the saffron and over to the pan. Naturally the diners love Remy's cuisine while lavishing Linguini with all the credit. None of them come down with botulism.Sign up to our Film Today emailRead more Judged solely in terms of animation technique, Bird's film is a masterpiece. The over-bright, fauvist colours that typified those early CGI outings have now been tempered by a richer, more subtle palette. There is a tangy sense of authenticity to the kitchen scenes, where the medallions of monkfish are lovingly prepared by a band of ex-cons and cardsharps before being bussed through to a palatial dining room that thrums to an undertone of clinking glasses and murmured conversation.Ratatouille is equally confident when it scurries outside. Pixar productions have always boasted a distinctive architectural nous, as witnessed in Monsters Inc's recreation of America's blue-collar neighbourhoods or The Incredibles' pristine sweep of retro 1950s suburbia. Here Bird's animators concoct a Paris of bustling little squares and misty riverside walkways. Certainly, Remy's first sight of the city, scuttling up a rooftop to check out the skyline, is as swooningly romantic as anything you'll find in Amélie or Les Amants du Pont-Neuf.ADVERTISINGAdvertisementExcept that's just the half of it. The perennial cliché trotted out about Pixar movies is that they are smart and soulful enough to be enjoyed by adults as well as children, as though this is somehow a shock and not a quality shared by every great family film right back to The Wizard of Oz. True to form, Ratatouille contains plenty of exuberant set pieces (fraught chases along the Seine, some gaudy slapstick involving a visiting health inspector). But this riff on Cyrano de Bergerac also works as a heartfelt parable of illegitimacy and a passionate plea for the role of the outsider. The clue is in the DNA of the three main characters. Colette (voiced by Janeane Garofalo) is a talented cook struggling to find a niche in a male- dominated profession. Linguini is revealed to be the unacknowledged bastard son of a noted celebrity chef. And Remy, of course, is a rat and therefore reviled by polite society. The diners love his food but want him dead.When Ratatouille stuttered at the US box office this summer, the subsequent fallout hinted at a growing rift between the Pixar animators and their paymasters at Disney; a marriage of convenience that is now pulling in opposite directions. Bizarrely, Bird's film gives the impression of anticipating this clash, this tussle between art and commerce, and bows out with a scene that places itself firmly on the avant garde, in a shabby bistro frequented by beret- wearing students and thrill-seeking hip-cats.For good measure, it gives the last word to a snooty food critic (Peter O'Toole) who sees the light and argues that the best role a reviewer can play is to champion the new; hailing those unsung heroes who are trying something different, regardless of their background, colour, creed or species.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Impressive animation, the story a Deja vu","The animation is simply impressive. As far as I can judge, no detail was left out. It was simply perfect. Even without comparing it to other animation movies I think one can agree that this one is for sure among the top ones. However, when it comes to the story, there is really nothing original about it. In its essence, there are so many similarities with ""The Perfume"", another superlative movie in my eyes. OK, Grenouille was really not a rat, maybe in the metaphoric sense he was, but still a nobody who created the most fine perfumes ever, just using his extraordinary well developed nose. Same as here. But at the end... who cares... Not everybody has seen ""The Perfume"" so this will leave him or her the freedom to enjoy without the feeling of deja vu. The movie is very entertaining and funny. It's a movie for the whole family and to some extent also educational, which is not always the case. For sure worth buying the DVD.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Fantastic movie for kids and adults,"I loved every minute of this film. The characters were real and endearing. The bad guys had real motivation and also provided a lot of comic relief. The main character goes on a great journey and you really feel for him the entire way. The movie is well-paced and doesn't seem to drag at any point. The voice talent was outstanding, the voices were very well suited to the characters with no overpowering ""star"" qualities. The animation is stunning, it takes your breath away at times. There were a few jokes for adults, lots of moments where everyone in the theater laughed and I didn't feel like there was any bathroom humor, which was nice.The movie was as beautiful as ""Nemo"" and as heartwarming as ""Toy Story"".

Review for Rataouille,"This was a film that I remember coming out. At that time, I wasn't watching animated films unless there was a reason. My stance from that point was that if I ever got married and/or had children, we would watch these films so I'd watch other things instead until that happened. If it never did, that was a risk I was willing to take.Now here we are following Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt). He's a rat that has an overdeveloped sense of smell and taste. He lives in a colony in the country. His father is the leader, Django (voiced by Brian Dennehy). Remy hangs out with his brother, Emile (voiced by Peter Sohn). Now something happens with Remy and it forces them to flee to find a new place to live. This leads them to Paris.In this world there is a famous chef named Gusteau (voiced by Brad Garrett). He believed that anyone could cook. This upsets a food critic, Anton Ego (voiced by Peter O'Toole). He has made it his life's work to ruin him. Now Anton passes away and Skinner (voiced by Ian Holm) has taken over the restaurant. He hires a young man named Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano) who has an interesting secret. He's the long-lost son of Gusteau. Skinner learns this and fears he'll lose everything. Linguini doesn't know how to cook, but does become a sensation, with the aid of this unlikely rat named Remy. There are much larger implications from this as well.That should be enough of a recap for this film and what I'll say is that much like these other films from Pixar, they're cute. They also have a good story and messages for kids. This one was a bit more difficult for me to enjoy, I was grossed out by the fact that we have rats in the kitchen and touching food. I'll also say that I'm terrified and grossed out by rats/mice. I know this is a cartoon, but I still try to watch everything that I do with eyes that this is real. There is also an interesting care put into this that Remy understands Linguini and humans in general. When he talks though, it just squeaks. There's a great training sequence where they get used to each other that I appreciated.Then going along with this, there is an interesting message here. Remy shouldn't be able to cook. The idea here is that the most likely genius can come from anywhere and I truly believe that. It takes passion and drive. There is a heartwarming aspect here as well that tasting certain foods can trigger the most wonderful memories. That made me smile. There is also an understanding that happens here between Linguini and Remy as well as his family. That acceptance is something that I'm glad gets included here. We may not agree with people doing things differently, but not everything has to be done how we feel it should be. I appreciate that message.I'll shift over to say that we have a solid cast of people here. They're all great. I will admit, I didn't realize who some of the people were until looking it up. Credit to disguise the voices. Oswalt was great as Remy. Skinner doesn't sound like Holm, but credit to him as this 'villain'. Romano works as our other lead. Bennehy, Sohn, O'Toole, Garrett, Janeane Garofalo, Will Arnett, James Remar, John Ratzenberger and the rest of the talent all fit the roles they're needed for.Then to just say that this is another great looking Pixar film. I'm not the biggest computer animation fan, but watching this on my 4K TV looks great. The care and detail that they put into this shows. Having this be animated allows them to do so much. It makes it a bit less gross that we're seeing rats touch human food, just knowing the diseases they carry and the plague. Me getting over that, this is a fun film for sure and would recommend it.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
snooze-a-tooey!,"I really don't understand the enthusiasm for this bland film. Sure the visuals may be stunning and clever, but without a plot that really grips who cares? The script seemed fractured and without focus. I kept trying to get pulled into the different characters' trials and tribulations, but I never felt that anything was really at stake emotionally.The film tries too hard to to appeal to the ""ordinary American"" and ends up talking down to the audience instead. At times it tries so hard to be all inclusive that it seems to be apologizing for the subject matter wearing a face red with embarrassment. When Collette (voiced by the abrasive Garofolo) describes all the macho backgrounds of the restaurants cooks I felt I was watching a movie from the 70's or earlier. I think America has grown sophisticated enough to no longer think all people interested in the culinary arts are decadent sissy snobs. Think of the popularity of the Food Network, Iron Chef America, Emeril Lagasse, Thomas Keller, Wolfgang Puck, Mario Batali, Bobby Flay, etc.!Instead of trying to prepare our appetites for an art form America already embraces, Pixar might have spent more time getting the script to show us the power of good food. The best moments involved O'Toole's Anton Ego. He was a character with interesting lights and darks that was underused. Patton Oswald's Rat was so boring. His conflict seemed superficial and the scenes with his family could have been cut at no loss to the storyline. Maybe a better actor could have given more pathos to the rat's plight, but a better script would have helped tons.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Pixar Does It Again,"We had the opportunity to see Ratatouille at a sneak peek at our theater a few days ago. Great plot, great animation (of course), great characters, overall a great movie. I think that one of the best parts is the life lessons this movie teaches, not only to children, but to us adults who may have forgotten a thing or two about life. The animation was superior, and so realistic. The scenes of Paris (that are in the previews) are fantastic, and there is a water scene near the beginning that will make you feel like you're actually experiencing what's happening on screen.

A good feeling movie,"It's pixar, right, so I was expecting high. But, again, they get you with their wise little change in style. I just saw the sneak preview and it not only met my expectations, I wasn't expecting this much actually. It started not bad, sort of classic, and went pretty well to the end. The best part about the movie I guess was the way the events were designed and the reasonings in the movie. You know, at parts, I was expecting some classic events that you expect from animation context. But they didn't, substituted by more realistic, human-like ones. Also, no exaggerated useless drama, just enough. The laughing parts were adequate and at the right times too, and on top of all, the animation itself. At some points, you could actually feel the afford they've put on this to look as real as possible, yet an animation. The only thing was that I just felt it could be better to have more shadows underneath rats' legs, but they're the experts, maybe I'm wrong. Overall, I have to say 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great film! One of Pixar's best ones.,"I also had the fortunate opportunity to attend a pre-screening yesterday at Century City, CA. I was very impressed and moved by this film. It's definitely better than Cars, Monsters Inc, and A Bug's Life.The screenplay was brilliant, as was the comedy, animation, the Frenchish musical score, and the voice acting. The movie, most importantly, also had the heart and soul that we've come to love from all the Pixar films.When you read reviews about people going into tears by the film's end, it's not because the movie was dramatic and tear jerking. It's because the movie was just so utterly satisfying. The mouse was also the symbol of happiness that we, as an audience, can identify with. He represents our universal love for food, art, and also giving back to the world with a generous heart. So in many ways, it was like a Rocky or Cinderella story for Remy. By film's end, he spends the rest of his life doing what he loves to do, no matter how dumb it may appear to be. And that is why the film was pretty moving.By far, I felt a bit hesitant whether to give the film a 10 because the story, although marvelously written, is a bit lighthearted compared to the urgency and scope of the ones in Toy Story 2 or The Incredibles. But at the same time, the film is so sophisticated and has a universal feel that it seems like it could be a masterpiece.Either way, I fully recommend it. I'm sure by the time the 200 or so critic's reviews come out, the film will at least average in the A- category. That's how good it really is. =]",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Pixar does it again, for everyone.","""Ratatouille"" is the latest computer-animated release from Pixar, the company that has produced the best animated films over the last decade. The odd title is the name of vegetable stew and doubles as a pun on the main character, a rat named Remy.Remy is no ordinary rat though. He resides in France amidst a colony that lives as rats do, thriving on the garbage and remnants of others, Remy is the exception because he has a finely-honed sense of smell and loves cooking. Through a series of fortunate events, Remy finds himself in Paris at a fine restaurant, where he learns how to interact with a kitchen boy named Linguini to create magnificent meals. Things of course get complicated, as Remy attempts to balance his passion with his family, and Linguini must handle being a celebrity through no talent of his own, while dealing with a sinister restaurant critic.Like all of Pixar's work, ""Ratatouille"" looks phenomenal. The rats in particular look good, with fine detail paid to fur in various states. The humans are not the most hyper-realistic creations seen on screen, but neither are they intended to be. This is a cartoon, and the artists seem to know that, because most of the characters border on caricature. The slimy French chef is ridiculously short and sports a pencil-line mustache. The critic has long and angular features that scream evil. Even though the movie is made with the most modern of technology, it is a throwback to the classic days of Disney and Looney Tunes, when merely a glance at a character would explain everything about a character. The bad guys look bad; the good guys are goofy but likable, and the gray characters share attributes of both, leaving the viewer guessing for a while.One thing that separates ""Ratatouille"" from most of its Pixar brethren is the pervasive kinetic energy. Plenty of other movies, like Cars and The Incredibles, were drenched with action and movement, but it feels different here because the scope of the movie is centered on a rat. When you watch Remy race through a kitchen or up a building from close-up, it feels much wilder and more dangerous than watching a human make the same thirty-foot trek, which is appropriate since it is more hazardous for a rat to make that trip.The question about all Pixar movies is twofold: how well does it play with kids, and how well does it play with adults? I suspect that Ratatouille may not be as accessible to kids as most of the rest of the Pixar library, because many of the characters are rats. Rodents are not as marketable or over-the-top memorable as a giant furry blue monster or an innocent little clown fish. Nor is the story quite as simple as some others. But the pace is brisk enough, and the story is understandable enough, thanks in large part to the brilliant animation, that kids should still enjoy the movie. Adults should enjoy it too, with the fine images, clever humor, and various twists and turns of the story. On the whole, ""Ratatouille"" is not as memorable as ""Finding Nemo"" or either ""Toy Story"", but it is good enough to be tucked right behind them with ""Monster's Inc."" Bottom Line: 7 of 10 for the best family film of the summer. What the heck, call it 8 of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Greatest Animated Film since Finding Nemo,"Ratatouille is a film that, with Pixar now at the helm of Disney's animation department, firmly and squarely places Disney right back at the peak of the animation business. It's is a sumptuous feast of cinematic delight that comes close to and may even be better than Finding Nemo.Remy is a young rat with a nose for good food and a mind for big dreams. He lives in the house of a grumpy old lady with a shotgun and spends his days daydreaming about delicious feasts and reaching that perfect pinnacle of good dish. A world-renowned French chef, Gusteau, is Remy's inspiration, and his book, Anyone Can Cook, is practically Remy's Bible. Remy's dad, however, isn't so fond of Remy's aspirations - in his mind, rats should stay in the garbage heap where they belong and not get picky about what they eat, so he uses Remy's talented nose to sort out the poisoned food from the safe food.Remy's passion is too great, though. His love for food knows no bounds, and he regularly sneaks off to try to cook. One day he screws up so badly that he and his family are forced to flee the old lady's house into the sewers, where Remy is separated from his family and discovers he's in one of the greatest cities for food in the world - Paris, and definitely the most beautiful CGI city that I've ever seen.From its first frame to its last, Ratatouille sparkles with a warm glow that is hands-down Pixar's best computer animation work. Everything about it is beautiful. They take a filthy creature like a rat and make it into this lovable little animal that will win you over instantly. The fur on Remy is also of astounding quality - if it weren't for his very human-like expressions it would look like a very believable rat. And it's not as if Pixar skimped on the rest of the rats while perfectly animating Remy. Every single one of Remy's colony is just as realistic as he is. The animation of the humans doesn't suffer either. Every single one of them, from the villainous Anton Ego to the hopeful chef Linguini is a perfect caricature, a brilliantly animated and creatively drawn masterpiece of character, life, and action.The story surrounding Remy and Linguini is simply inspirational. To see Remy dropping spices joyfully into soup, to see him happily sniffing his concoction to discover the perfect taste and smell is to watch Picasso paint a masterpiece, Beethoven compose a soothing piece of music, an Olympic gymnast land the perfect routine. Remy's refusal to settle for anything less than excellent is a testimony. ""Don't eat garbage!"" he yells at his brother. This isn't a movie about a rat cooking in a kitchen. This is a movie about one person following his dream and not settling for anything less than the best. And as much as it's not simply about a rat cooking, it is about food. The food in this movie and the way it was prepared and presented like the perfect dish - I was salivating throughout, even especially when Remy was cooking the foot. It all looked delicious and wonderful and perfectly good enough to eat.Yet another great thing about Ratatouille is its perfect pacing. At an hour and fifty minutes, one would think a cartoon would drag, but each scene is great and the film moves along at a nicely clipped pace, never pausing too long in once place and never cutting one scene too short. There wasn't once in this movie where I thought it dragged - from the very beginning I was sucked in and I wasn't released until the beautiful credits finished rolling. The gorgeous soundtrack perfectly suits the beautiful city of Paris and it's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in an animated film in a long while.The list of what makes this movie great just keeps going on and on. The voice acting in Cars was kind of unremarkable, and though the Incredibles was accomplished in every way and the voice acting was nothing bad, it wasn't particularly memorable. I questioned Patton Oswalt as the voice of Remy when I first heard about it. I don't particularly care of the comedian in real life, so I wondered how wise of a choice he was. But he perfectly conveys Remy's little passionate spunky self, wonderfully nuanced, great comedic timing, and absolutely believable. Brad Garrett did possibly the best voice work of his life - normally his voice is instantly recognizable, but he fit greatly into the role of Gusteau. Peter O'Toole was perfectly frightening, conniving, and evil in his role as the food critic.Another very clear strength of this movie is that it refuses to cater and stoop to traditional close-minded views that cartoons are just for kids. Even films like Shrek that adults are allowed to consider cool clearly pander to younger children - especially the last installment in the series. Ratatouille is for adults. It is not a movie that is meant for kids. This is not to say that kids will not get plenty out of it - there are bright colors, hilarious characters, and a funny story - any seven-year old will love it. But there is also plenty for adults to enjoy too. A lot of the humor is too subtle for the young ones to catch.I still don't know if Ratatouille beats Finding Nemo, I would need to see it again to decide, but it is most definitely close. It's undoubtedly the best movie so far this year, and the best animated film I've seen in a long while. A delicious and filling and wholesome feast of animated goodness and solid story combined with hilarious comedy and real characters, Ratatouille succeeds in every possible way and I wouldn't be surprised if it ended up being the greatest movie of 2007.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Gem Of A Dish,"Not since Finding Nemo have I been so captivated by a Pixar movie - and trust me on this one folks, this is quite possibly their finest work to date and most definitely shows a genuine return to form.Of course, it's easy to go on about the stunning computer animation and the fluidity of the models - but the real winners here are the characters that despite being a string of zeros and ones, are so utterly captivating and convincing, it's hard to believe they aren't real - and that's coming from someone who has a hard time with suspension of disbelief.Stunning really is too mild a description for a piece of art such as this, and metaphorically speaking, this movie has been perfectly cast, crafted and cooked to perfection. The actors have not only given their all for this, they seem to have delighted in it. The soundtrack is majestic, with the quirky in-jokes and subtle adult gags all firmly in place.If you've got kids - hell, even if you haven't - pop down to your nearest theatre post haste and enjoy, in my humble opinion - the finest computer animated movie made to date.

The main character, Linguini, whose first name seems to not exist, is maybe a little over the top, but very likable anyway.Like a classic drama it contains villains, and heroes, but none is totally good, or totally bad. And the good guy wins, in a grand way!Nothing to dislike, except, maybe, a slight editing would have increased the pace a bit, like the rats's cooking scene, that uses the same sequence, twice!

Adorable Pixar tale.,Like many other Pixar movies this is a modern animated classic it's the story of Remy a rat who has a passion for cooking and unlike other rats he won't eat just any thing he finds. Remy meets a young wannabe Chef at a restaurant who find out Remy is a cooking rat and has him help him in becoming a master chef. Linguini's boss Skinner knows something is up and sets out to expose him Skinner also exploits and commercializes Remy's late idol Auguste Gusteau buy selling many different products with Auguste's image on it. It's not so much a comedy but it has a great story like many other Pixar movies it proves that animated movie don't have to be that funny to work it' one of the few pixar movies i have seen in the theater. The ending is very happy and it show rats in a good light something that almost never happens there's also a subplot of Remy's family's who don't think rats should be clean or coexist with humans. It is a great family movie that shows how it's not bad to be different and unlikely friendships can work out. This was originally not going to be a Disny movie it was going to be Pixer's first movie without Disny before the company's got back together. Ps. there is also a mock buster movie called Ratatoing that i haven't seen yet but i plan to and review.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"RATATOUILLE, a banquet of fun for the whole family.","Pixar's latest animated entry should satisfy the most discriminating palate. It's critics will say it's just another fish out of water buddy movie. But I don't care. In a summer, so far devoid of any originality, this movie is refreshing and fun. The story is easy to follow. You know who the good guys are. You know who the bad guys are. You laugh because it's funny. Not because it's added humor to amuse the adults who had to take their kids to a Saturday matinée. I get a little tired of the targeted humor and having to stop and explain to the kids why I thought it was funny and they didn't get it. For the most part Pixar films have been void of ignoble humor. I liked this film as much as my boys, (10 and 13). This Rat has a quick pace, danger and intrigue. It's chock full of positive messages and family values. I didn't cringe and most importantly I didn't fall asleep. I read comics when I was young watch the Flinstones and Jetson's and Rocky and Bulwinkle and I feel this 3D animation is just another upgrade. At the root of every movie animated or not is the story and this story is solid. I give the latest rodent in the Disney family a meaty thumbs up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Delicious!,"To be frank, I watched the movie because there was a discount on tickets that day, and I wasn't expecting much of it, but it truly surprised me. The animation was absolutely fantastic, the sets were all gorgeous and the food looked good enough to eat.Remy is the epitome of cuteness and one cannot help but love him. The other characters, too, are equally fleshed out and will keep you rooting for them - even the seemingly dour Anton Ego will gain your sympathy in what is surely one of the most heartwarming moments in Ratatouille.All in all, Ratatouille is a little gem not to be missed, and could very well be the best animated feature this year, beating the likes of Shrek 3 and The Simpsons.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixars finest,"I've witnessed something incredible today.Even after witnessing all the incredible advances made in the field of computer animation, and especially by Pixar, I've seen a movie today, which has made a big leap forward. I've never seen an animation movie like Ratatoullie. Brad Bird is in my mind the absolute best director when it comes to 3D movies. He crafts intelligent stories, believable characters and best of all: He does not have a need to make everything look realistic, something that a movie like Shrek is really bad about. I remember the commentary track for Shrek 2, where the directors where crazy-like proud of the eyes of Shrek and Fiona, blabbering on and on (and on!) about the detail put into them, and how it made the characters SO much more believable. And guess what: You never, ever notice their eye detail, since, even when zoomed in on them, you can't see it. At all.Brad Bird characterizes his characters, which is a brilliant choice. If you want your CG-movie to look as realistic as possible, why not just make a normal movie instead? This brings out the essence of the character and emphasizes it, making them much stronger, than a realistic looking CG-character could ever be.Now, this movie does not make any of the mistakes, that Cars did. I mean - a race car setting up neuron lights on the roof of every house in a city?You believe in Ratatoullie, the characters, the story and the animation (which is the best ever - did I mention that already?).I strongly encourage anyone and everyone to go see this movie. You won't be disappointed. This gives you a very strong taste of just what Pixar is capable of. From start to finish, this movie bites you in the butt, chews on your eyes and punches your laughing-muscles to oblivion... And you enjoy every second of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"A dish cooked well but lacks flavour, spice and toppings","We can all see the hard work put into the film and looks quite expensive although not as expensive as its budget which is $150 million. But the film has an absolute poor story-line that is probably written by a 10 year old child and lacks a single decent joke. It was about 2 hours with not even a paragraph of story about a rat who is helping a chef to cook; if the story is supposed to be poor then they should have cut down the running length about 1 hour 20 minutes. The film was about 2 hours but it seemed about 4 hours and when it ended I sighed with relief and I thought that it would never end.Ratatouille is critically acclaimed and they said that it's smart which is absolutely wrong because you didn't even have to be of average intelligence to understand and come up with the plot. I just don't know why critics always have wrong opinions. I'm not a critic myself but I still told the fact.I liked Pixar ever since I've seen Toy Story. Their animation is wonderful and stories are always interesting. For the first time I'm disappointed and about 60% of the film was quite boring that I had a look around the cinema hall and some children were asleep, adults were yawning and a couple of people just left and never came back. Basically everyone was dying by boredom. Pixar usually make their films suitable for all ages but Ratatouille isn't, it's too long for children and boring for adults.The Simpsons Movie was a million times better because it had a much more intelligent plot; every single scene was extremely funny, shorter running length and was made half the budget of Ratatouille. The only reason why I can say that it's a blockbuster because it's a Pixar movie and they really did a good job fooling everyone with the really interesting trailer. The top 5 best Pixar films are:1) Monsters Inc2) Finding Nemo3) Cars4) Toy Story5) The Incredibles",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Another Pixar Winner,"I saw Ratatouille last night at a sneak preview. It was very entertaining. As to be expected with Pixar films, the animation was incredibly dense with amazing attention to detail -- particularly water -- but the script and story were also top-notch. Voice talent was great; Patton Oswalt is a funny guy and I can see him having a nice career in animation in addition to his stand-up. The nice cast surprise for me was Peter O'Toole as a food critic. He almost singlehandedly steals the show, but there's enough humor to go around. A fun, sweet movie.I've enjoyed Brad Bird's other films, and Ratatouille is another feather in his cap.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A chef-d'oeuvre served by the Pixar-Disney combo,"One thing that Pixar has always done exceptionally well, and that has distinguished them as the preeminent animated storytellers (with the exception of maybe Disney and Studio Ghibli), is put the story and characters at the forefront of each of their films. One of the most fascinating legends out there is the ""Pixar Theory"", which is the belief of a ""shared universe"" in which all the Pixar characters, and their stories, reside in. One certainty is, however, that all Pixar films are connected by their true-to-life themes, exploring subject matter that will never manage to be obsolete and always manage to tug at those heart strings.When I first heard of ""Ratatouille"", I expected the usual, formulaic Pixar routine: A mismatched pair of partners embark on an adventurous journey. There will be a colourful ensemble of supporting players amidst the ""hidden world"" brought to life by everyday objects. But ""Ratatouille"" took the mismatch concept to refreshingly new heights. A rat is a virtual antithesis to humans and so we are enticed by the story to show us how similar these two characters are despite their inherent differences.""Ratatouille"" is carried by great storytelling and characterization, fuelled by the instant conflict between our titular rodent, a bumbling kitchen boy and his impromptu ascension on the food chain (no pun intended). Remy (Patton Oswalt), is a Parisian rat whose dream is to be a grand chef in ""The City of Lights"". He has quite the sophisticated palate and appreciates the art of fine dining. One day he finds himself astray and arrives at one of Paris' finest restaurants. And this is where the real story begins. Could we genuinely buy into the idea that a boy can befriend and cook with a rat? Usually no but Pixar, and their exquisite weaving of such dreams, makes this feat imaginable.There is so much heart in this film and the usage of Paris as its backdrop adds a charming, exquisite touch to its telling. Remy's occasional musing gazes at the view of Paris invite us to similarly admire the visual allure Pixar has presented us with. The animation is simply superb – the dark, polluted areas where the rats reside almost feel like a separate world when entering the dazzling, colourful city-scape of the Parisian neighbourhoods. The painstaking details of the rat are also impressive, from the movements of its fur against the wind to the functioning of the rest of its body parts like its ears, nose and eyes.There is an undeniable realism felt throughout the film, largely achieved by the stellar voice acting present throughout. Patton Oswalt is someone I would not have pictured in the role as Remy but, after experiencing him, I could not have imagined anyone else capturing the pathos as well as he did. Same goes for Lou Romano, Janeane Garofalo, Brad Garrett, Ian Holm (and Peter O'Toole!). Overall, ""Ratatouille"" may serve up the conventional themes we have come to expect from Pixar, but it is able to deliver them with such depth and magic that I place it on a pedestal by itself as a cinematic masterpiece. ""Ratatouille"" is a dish best served to everyone!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Slow start, but a VERY good movie","This movie takes a while to get started -but to that note, there is a LOT of material imparted -its not boring, and what amazed me is that even in a theater full of children, they were obviously engaged in the movie -not the usual restlessness you generally see with a movie like this, and a very young crowd. The animation was (as expected by Pixar) excellent, the detail was the usual fantastic level we've come to expect. We went to the 'sneak preview' showing, and I must say that even though it started slow, the story was very fulfilling and had an emotional ending (which, while this would also be 'as expected' it was pulled off very well). It truly earned its 'G' rating -it wasn't loaded with innuendo like so many of them are these days, and while the dialog had a decided nod toward the adults in the crowd -not dirty, it just wasn't strictly aimed at kids, so you didn't see many adults just nodding off while they waited for the ending. Lastly, its been YEARS since I've attended a movie (and never in an animated one) where the entire theater burst into applause at the end. People sat all the way through the credits (my wife and I always do anyway -especially to catch the often included little 'bits' at the very end -and we're usually the only ones left by that point). Overall a very rewarding experience, and I look forward to adding this title to my DVD collection when it comes out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Another classic by Brad Bird,"Brad Bird, a member of the Simpsons team in its early days and the writer and director of the Iron Giant and the Incredibles. Pixar studios have made some of the best animated films ever, film Toy Story to the Wall-E, only missing the mark once. Pixar is the only Hollywood studio that can get away with such uncinematic material.The plot focuses on Remy (Patton Oswalt), a rat from rural France who has a highly developed sense of taste and smell. He is obsessed with cooking and after getting separated from his colony ends up in the centre of Paris. He goes to the result of his ideal Auguste Gusteau who had recently died. He watches the kitchen staff work and sees the new garbage boy Linguini (Lou Romano) nearly ruining the soap of the day. Remy goes in to the kitchen an starts to make a tasty, but gets caught by Linguini. However, Linguini comes up with the idea that the two can work in a team and the young man becomes a cooking celebrity in France. However, the team have to take on the villainous the head-chef Skinner (Ian Holm) who used Auguste Gusteau's image to sell cheap frozen dinners. During the film Remy and Linguini suffer the highs and lows of celebrity and cookery and friendship, strain loyalties and romance, as well as tacking the evil Skinner and having to please the Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), the toughest food critic in Paris.The animation is beautiful, which is what you expect from a Pixar film, but there is more then that. In Ratatouille there are characters you care about, good voice acting, a strong plot, great designs and a lot of research was conducted. This was a film made from love. The humour is mostly slapstick, but it's a kid film, so you expect it and it's good slapstick. There were also good visual and verbal jokes. The best humour involves the mass of rats. I also thought that the hard-as-nails female chef Collette (Janeane Garofalo) was an excellent comic creation. There is also some dark humour and jokes for adults. However there is one scene which may upset very young or sensitive children, but most will like it.I admit I prefer the Incredibles, but Ratatouille is an excellent follow up by Brad Bird and I would like him to either do a sequel for the Incredibles or work as the Simpsons show runner just to sort out the once great show.Fantastic film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Ratatouille is a breath of fresh air!,"This is a movie that the whole family should enjoy. It is cute enough for young kids and deep enough for the older people. Plus, it's funny. Not very, but just funny enough to keep you entertained. The older folks can really connect with the story.The animation is truly an art. It looks very realistic and fluid spare a few of the scenes. They can make rats look cute...what am I saying, it's what they do :DI thank Disney for making movie enjoyable again for the whole family. The last few years had been a dark age for Disney family movies. I really hope that they can continue in this path for years to come. It's really no fun when parents have to sit through a movie which they don't enjoy.I will give it an 8.8 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A good movie comes from anywhere... especially if it is Pixar's.,"It has always been my sneaking regret not being able to catch this film in the theaters despite all its rave reviews. That was why when i had a chance to finally catch it on DVD, i wanted to make it a good experience (3am at night with peace and quiet).The movie pans out introducing the animal protagonist(?), Remy the rat. His natural talent of mixing and tasting eventually leads to a coincidental meeting with the clueless douche of a cook, Linguine. Friendship blossoms and they face challenges which the movie will unfold.Graphical quality as usual is needless to say, superb. Featuring a cast of relatively unknown voice actors, the feeling and impression I get from viewing the movie is refreshing as I am not unduly forced to picture the famous voice actors face or their past works(Eddie Murphy as Donkey or Mushu). But truly, the heart and soul of the movie still lies with its extremely heartfelt engaging storyline. Just armed with basic setting and characters, the movie without fail delivers a huge impact on the viewers due to its amazing character development and plot. The simplicity behind the film is not to be underestimated.Definite thumbs up to Pixar for always delivering quality movies. One of the few movies that makes me feel good, inspired and not regretting the time spent on watching the movie.9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
This movie drags..boring second half,"This movie is too long for an animated movie. The second half drags and have nothing much to offer on fun part. Compared to earlier Disney movies its not that funny, and character development is less. The story itself is completely unbelievable at times, mainly towards the end . All rats cooking the meal for full restaurant is hard to swallow. Movie starts well and looks promising and looses its grip after an hour. Surely it has to be edited by at least 20 minutes. Its still worth watching one time on DVD. The animation is good and some of the rat chasing sequences were well directed. It deserves a rating of 5-6 , not more than that.

A very sweet film with very cute rats!,"If you have ever said that rats are cute but no-one believes you, this animated CGI film may just be able to prove your point! With a weird, topsy-turvy plot with good Pixar quality, this film is sure to delight! Even though the adventure and dare may overdo itself, the characters and theme thankfully do not. The theme is cooking and it will not be a surprise that you will want to eat/cook just after you have viewed this motion picture! Also like all Pixar films, this has good quality CGI, the water and Paris sequences are definitely something to admire. So even if you are becoming bored of CGI, this film WILL NOT make you even more bored!Remy is a rat in France with an unusual dream: to cook. He is originally starting out life testing food for rat poisoning, but of course he is becoming bored. When a crazy old woman chases him and his rat family (which is a huge number of rats) out of her home, Remy loses his way and ends up lost in the sewers. There, he resolves to follow his dream and finding the famous ""Gustseau's Restaurant"" and is determined to start cooking.

A most delicious Ratatouille to be savored many times,"Let me declare this outright, Brad Bird is pure genius and on top of that, one with a lot of class. Here is an animated feature with EVERYTHING: comedy, suspense, satire, an engaging story, brilliant artwork and superb voice-overs, a fine music score (although no Randy Newman song *sniff*) and all that topped up with LOTS of Pizazz. As a critic, i always look out for flaws; as a movie-lover, i tend to be forgiving. In this case, there are hardly any flaws to speak of and so, nothing to forgive. Animated rats have always been cute, but the ones here are not only lovable but very realistically characterised as well. While this animated feature may have been made with the adult viewer in mind, there is more than enough of the fun factor thrown in so that the younger ones will find it appealing as well. At the same time, many life lessons were included as part of the story; thankfully, these were not imparted in a heavy-handed way. This is indeed a hearty feast for all the senses, and one to be savored over and over again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Probably the Best Film if Not most Entertaining of 2007!,"Ratatouile is one of those films than can entertain children as well as adults. It's smart, beautifully crafted in animation.

She blows the ceiling only to discover a scene like in Williard or Ben about a thousand rats living above her. Horrified, she begins shooting like Dick Cheney on vacation. She doesn't stop once they leave her house which almost destroyed. She goes right on separating the main character rat and his family and friends.

Over-hyped and just not that funny,"I just watched Ratatouille on DVD, and I am glad I didn't spend $10 to see it in theaters. I was really excited to see it after all the hype and great reviews I had heard and read. Last year, I was pleasantly surprised by Cars and was hoping to be just as pleased with this film. Unfortunately, my experience with Ratatouille was not as great. From the beginning, I felt that it wasn't going to be that entertaining, but I hoped it was just a slow start. Nope, the slow, boring, tedious pace continued. I found myself chuckling only maybe 3 times at most at scenes that weren't that unique. So many of the other Pixar films were truly hilarious in such creative ways. Also, I know that a film has made an impact on me if I can remember little quotes or parts that stood out, and are easily recognizable when someone randomly says them (such as Guido's ""Pit stop?!"" from Cars or Dory's ""I shall call him Squishy, and he shall be mine, and he shall be my Squishy"" from Finding Nemo). There is nothing of that sort from Ratatouille, other than ""Anyone can cook""...lame lol. I was really expecting a lot more from this film, but it just didn't deliver like past Pixar films. It's probably one of my least favorite animated films ever. I just hope Pixar can rebound and produce more awesome films like they have in the past.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Another Very Nice Animation,"While i am looking IMDb top 250 i have seen Ratatouille and first i am curious because of the name of the movie. When i looked at the summary of the movie, my curiosity had increased. I watched the movie and while i am watching it, it makes me feel relaxed and i don't think so much about what is going next? I just watched and i had a great time. Making this movie is not only giving people the idea that everyone just can cook, but also it gives people the idea that they can do everything that they want when they really want. Director successfully gives that idea to watchers i think. Thank you all who make this animated movie. I just need relaxed nowadays and this movie make it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Ratatouille is another highly enjoyable Disney/Pixar animated feature,"Ratatouille is another highly enjoyable Pixar/Disney animated feature film that should do very well at the box office in its opening weekend. Having just said that, I must admit that the constant laughs I was expecting mainly seemed to come in fits and starts. Despite that, however, I found the story very enjoyable especially near the end when All is revealed. I found myself crying when that came so this movie definitely touched me on some level. Now that I think about it, I can't think of anything I would cut out or shorten so if the humor doesn't always flow smoothly, when the laughs come from me or the audience I feel they are deserved for the most part. Loved the scenes involving the old lady discovering the rats in her house and her attempts to shoot them all. Loved the constant weird movements involving the garbage-boy-turned-chef-with-a-rat-in-him that made the other staff look at him. And definitely loved the relationship between that garbage boy and the rat Remy and the way they cooperated together. Not to mention Remy's constant speaking to an image of his idol, Gusteau. So while not the funniest Pixar feature (The first Toy Story probably deserves that distinction), Ratatouille is certainly one of the most touching. So on that note, I definitely recommended it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Magic!,"Disney like the word ""magic"". And in this case, the great marriage between Disney and Pixar work so well that the result is Magic. Magic for its original scenario, for the characters, the design and of course, and above all, the terrific animation. While a rat is not a very lovable animal, Pixar succeeded to make a little rodent, and all his family, most adorable and friendly. I tell you, you wont see a rat the same way after watching ratatouille ! By the way, the selling of rats in the UK, as a pet, had been grown up to 50 % since the release of the movie. Not 10/10 because of the score and the song, sang in a very weak, broken french. But over-whole, once again, a great journey into magic. Dreamworks can still manage and try to do better.

Ratatouille — Be mesmerized and transported to a different world with novel ideas,"Ratatouille is the kind of animated movie that mesmerizes you with its details, inventiveness, and story.The subject matter is simply a genius idea. Rats have been used before as animated characters, but never like this. Their world is unreal, but somehow, anchored in reality. The sheer amount of details each scenes has is mind blowing. The dialogs are strong and well thought out. The scenario impeccable and won't let you go once its starts. The voice acting is superb. All of it, pure Pixar.On an interesting note: apparently, they finally got the hang of animating wet fur, and seem pretty close on getting it for wet hair.The only negative thing I can find is that Skinner and Anton Ego are both designed a bit too strongly on the ""evil"" side, which is not a habit for Pixar. However, that's very minor, and they both fit very well in the decor.A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Smells like ...,"... another Pixar hit. And it tastes and looks like one too! Concerning the latter: We're used that Pixar movies look good (other animation studios can keep up with the looks), but it's the story, the characters and maybe a magic ingredient, that differentiates Pixar from other studios ...So maybe Cars wasn't really Pixars best movie (it really wasn't, although if that's the baddest they get, than they don't have to worry at all!), but they made up for that with this movie. While the low expectations (mine) for a movie involving a car were met, some people might have been more than surprised, that the ""rat""-story did work out! I can only recommend this very highly (doesn't matter if you're young or old, or even in-between), all you have to do is watch it ... unless you have a fear of rats and/or animated movies of course!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Truly brilliant.,"Ratatouille is an absolute treat of a movie. Its a well written , consistently entertaining and visually stunning film that effortlessly ranks as one of the best of 2007.The films story, in which a sewer rat dreams of becoming a chef, sounds pretty dubious on paper but thanks to a sharp witted script, excellent voice acting (particularly from o'toole) and that indescribable sprinkle of pixar magic , ratatouille transcends its odd synopsis and emerges as a wondrous film that you will want to watch over and over again.As to be expected, the film looks gorgeous. From the ultra realistic food and wet rat hair to the beautiful shots of Paris, every frame of the film is a stunning sight to behold.

Pure delight,"Rats, face it, are not the most popular creature on Earth, even if they are one the most numerous. Look at the vile creature that sneaks into the baby's room in Lady and the Tramp and you'll get a good idea of Man's perception on these little creatures.But Pixar transforms these 'vile little beasties' into something completely adorable and lovable. And so, we get Remy. Remy's dream is to become a chef and eat real food instead of the rubbish that rats usually feast upon. After being separated from his family in an 'American Tail'-esquire way, he goes on a crazy ride through the sewers (in the style of 'Fievel goes West') and ends up under Paris. Meanwhile, a young man named Linguinie, on the wishes of his dead mother, is given a job at the three (formely five) star restaurant Gusteau's. When the two finally meet after a near-miss with some soup, the talent-less Linguinie realises his cooking potential in the little animal...Sure, it might seem a bit far fetched with the whole 'rat knows how to cook' theme, but Ratatouille is just such a funny, sweet and charming film that you'll forget all about it. It's touching without getting too overly sentimental and it's funny without becoming too juvenile and forced (that one too often sees in todays numerous CGI flicks). The food in the film looks very delicious. It doesn't look like plastic at all. I know this is going to sound weird, but even the cake in the rubbish heap looked tasty. Ratatouille will not only evoke emotions, it''ll evoke your stomach too! The rendering and imagery is just fantastic.The plot is fun and more importantly, unpredictable - which was a real problem in Pixar's previous films. The characters are memorable too. If I had to sum up Ratatouille in one word, it would be 'sweet.' Linguinie's somewhat odd friendship with Remy is sweet, all of the rats look sweet, just the entire film is sweet and funny. Go see Ratatouille - it's a delightful offering in today's animated wasteland.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Seriously how can this film get more than 1 star,"The fact this film is about a rat cooking for humans is absolutely repulsive, putting me off of French food. The French stereotype in the film is also incredibly offensive. I don't understand Disney's love affair with rodents, there follow up film 'Tales of Desperuex' was just as awful. Personally rats and mice are horrible and most people would probably agree with me. Disney/Pixar's quality of films in the past 10 years has really dropped, since 'The Incredibles' all their other films have been dreadful, excluding Up and Toy Story 3.

Become a chef with Ratatouille's help,"I haven't seen it in theaters and I was very curious.The first time I saw it,I was very excited.Ratatouille is another Pixar's classic with lovable characters,humor and action plus a taste of Paris.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Classic comedy and feel good plot make scrumptious story,"Remy, an ambitious rat has always dreamed of making it as a top chef in France and after an accident, he winds up in the French Capital and helps nervous chef Linguini to create a name for himself.Pixar have become the biggest animated company in the world, joining forces with Disney just after the millennium and though the companies have had their differences, there can be no question that they can still make fine cinematic viewing, which is evident with this 2007 Oscar winning animation.The Incredibles director Brad Bird returns to Pixar and creates a wonderful sentimental story which takes a while to get into but leaves a smile on your face come the end.The beginning is intriguing with the camera freezing right on a rat that has just dived out of the window away from a human and simply narrates ""I should rethink my life a little"" this little sentence along with a few other well scripted words helps paint the picture of what being a rat is like, and soon the audience is engulfed into a life of hardship, about looking like pests and living in a world of survival.The plot is consistent but does take a while to get fully into as the characters are introduced slowly. Once the main ideology is set down about cooking and Linguini is introduced, does the plot pick up and we see a strong man and animal relationship develop which is highly likable and funny at times. Like other Pixar films the comedy is equally measured alongside a good plot and a heavy use of human emotions, for animals and humans.A side issue of animal cruelty is evident towards the end and has a great twist to the evil side of the world, creating hope for the characters.The comedy comes thick and fast during the middle of the film when Remy and Linguini meet and the sheer ideology of a rat cooking will provide plenty of giggles, if not as strong as Toy Story or Monsters Inc.Pixar's animation is the at it's very best here with the graphics mouth watering and just keeps getting better throughout the 111 running time.Ratatouille does rely on a few clichés but creates a wonderful atmosphere in doing so with good comedy and a feel good narrative which is healthy for the entire family.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Best movie of all time,"""In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations, the new needs friends...

"Fantastic, with Depth","The film comes with a theme that endeavour goes a long way. It calls for the core ability and latent values for both people and arts, instead of peoples' outlook or their past. Quality output can arise from simple and inexpensive materials in the presence of innovation and diligence. The story brings two apparently incompatible subjects together: rat and fine dining. It is rhetorically weak subject wise but propitiating both story wise and theme wise, coming with a classical narrative flow of Hollywood flicks. The epilogue brings an enlightening remark for commentators of any kind. The Cantonese version of voice-acting (Hong Kong) is excellent. Some graphics and dialogues are locally adapted with vividness enhanced. The flick is no less a film for adults as well and a good one with depth indeed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Superb Animation, Sleepy Story","I brought my four children to see Ratatouille tonight, excited by the high score and comments of praise posted here. I was quite surprised by what we saw.Indeed, the animation set the bar, redefining the state of the art. The use of textures, reflection, and transparency, along with sound (as in the sewer journey) were approaching the point where it was indistinguishable from reality. For me, this made the movie a joy to my senses from beginning to end.That said, all four children (ages 6-13) and I found the story very slow, to the point of tedium. It nearly put my two older children to sleep and the younger ones were restless awaiting the end.So I award my points based on the ground-breaking animation and the wonderful use of place (nearly the same locations as Bourne Identity!), but this movie will not be added to the set of animation classics.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An Interesting Film,"WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!We all know that Pixar has never made a bad movie and I personally love all of them and this one is no exception, however it takes a different approach for a Pixar film. The plot is very original and very creative. Following a rat's dream to be a cook in France was a great idea. It's like two opposite world's colliding. The CGI is fantastic and there are moments where you actually forget your watching an animated movie. Unfortunately there aren't many funny scenes in the movie but It doesn't need them, the film works in different sort of way. This is a Pixar movie that keeps interested in the story and not the comedy. I thought Remmy constantly talking to an imaginary apparition of his idol was weird but other than that I can't really find anything else to wrong with it. Overall, a very entertaining movie and worth watching at least once.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"The Cook is a Rat, his Cooking is an Art...","While in the past, an imposing belly was the sign of good wealth, today: the poorer, the fatter.Indeed, good and healthy taste, in our junk/frozen/industrialized-food consuming society, became a luxury. This might explain the success of cooking-related TV programs, the sight of an appetizing meal is as rewarding to our senses as if it was eaten. Some surrender to bad food, out of laziness, those who don't learn to cook and are rewarded by the certitude that they'll always eat well, in total respect to their tastes and their stomachs.But can anyone cook?The question is raised in Disney Pixar's animated movie ""Ratatouille"", released in 2007, and it's as serious and defining as a problem in a high school essay. Everything in the film subtly relates to that simple question. Is the required discipline and dedicated available to the common mortal? The film doesn't provide answers, it's too adult for that, it just gratifies us with two great characters and let us figure out for ourselves. Of course, the most important and fascinating one is that blue rat, Remy, whose dream is to become a chef. The title ""Ratatouille"" is very well chosen as it plays on the word 'rat' and an iconic French meal, it also contributes to one of the most original climactic moments for any film.Remy is a fascinating character, even by Pixar standards, contrarily to many usual leads, his goal isn't conditioned by a specific mission, limited to the film's time-frame. This is a rat with a highly developed sense of taste and smell that was first used in order to detect poison. But later, Rémy felt he had a gift, he could recognize good food and from that, could learn about cooking. His idol is Chef Gusteau, a French cook whose motto was ""anyone can cook"". Remy used to watch him on a TV belonging to the old lady (whose house served as a refuge to the rats' colony) until discovering the chef died a long ago because of a scathing critic from Anton Ego who was probably to food what Pauline Kael was to the movies. This is a rather dark moment in the film where it's impossible not to believe the chef committed suicide, this is no joke in France as previous chef Bernard Loiseau committed suicide after losing one star is the fear Michelin Guide, the book whose effects can either be beneficial or disastrous.But it's still a Disney film and not to discomfort young viewers, Gusteau is resurrected in Remy's imagination. After escaping from the old lady's gunshots, his family vanishes in the sewer while he floats on the cooking book and maybe hallucinating out of hunger, discusses with the illustrated Gusteau (who's like 'Ghosto' all through the film). Remy wonders if anyone can cook as the chef pretends. But he actually gives another meaning to the question, it's not ""can anyone cook, even an amateur?"" but ""can anyone cook, even a rat?"" Remy will prove that, even as a rat, he can cook to perfection because he belongs to the category of gifted people who take cooking seriously. And he's immediately gotten the opportunity to prove his talent by fixing a soup almost spoiled by a new sous-chef hired in Gusteau's restaurant.Linguini is a lanky and awkward boy in his early twenties, he's hired by Gusteau's former sous-chef, a diminutive and sneaky-looking cook named Skinner. When he accidentally spills the soup and blindly drops ingredients in it, Remy manages to fix it, and the soup catches the attention of a prestigious critic. It's a matter of time before Linguini and Remy discover that they can communicate, and Remy becomes to Linguini what Cyrano was to Christian, a Ghost cook, so to speak, managing to guide his body in order to cook the perfect food. This is also a nice pretext to some of the film's best visual gags, the most explicit manifestations of slapstick and visual humor in a rather serious film. The smallness and fastness of Remy, the nonchalant and thin silhouette of Linguini creates great interaction, but it's the complicity between the two that drive the story.The second act allows us to discover that Linguini is Gusteau's unknown son and is likely to inherit the restaurant, which gives Skinner a status of clear antagonist. Meanwhile, a conventional romance develops between Linguini and Colette, the only female chef of the team (made of very interesting characters) and I think there was enough relationships in the film, Remy and his brother and father and even Linguini to really make us care for the romance. The crew was made of intriguing and interesting guys but their under-use didn't come as a surprise given how Rémy and Linguini formed a solid pair. Colette was a colorful and interesting character on her own but she didn't need to be in love with Linguini to help him. So, the film loses its track until a fantastic climax whose merit is not to rely on the traditional confrontation of good vs. evil.Anton Ego, tastes a piece of 'ratatouille' and lives a wonderful Madeleine Proust episode. In a way, this Madeleine moment makes the film's point about cook, it's an emotional connection, we love food that reminds us of something. I'll never forget the first tiramisu I ate, the best and I couldn't find the same taste. Food is something that revives emotions, mostly positive, it can indeed draw a smile in your face, and this is the power of ""Ratatouille"", it's inspirational on countless levels.I can imagine a kid dreaming of being a cook thanks to ""Ratatouille"", which is a serious vocation-inspiring film, but supposing Gusteau was wrong and not anyone can cook, then I hope the film's beautiful story will inspired kids to dream of being capable to bring the same joy and happiness to people by doing something with as dedication, love and passion as Remy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The best yet!,"I generally like animated movies more, so my review might be biased a little. But overall, the movie was great. It was very relatable.

One of a kind...,"Pixar, once again, does a fantastic job of transporting us into its world... this world? Culinary Paris... from a Rat's perspective.The animation is terrific, but more than that, the music, setting, scenery, characters and humor all fit together so well into this storyline.The story would most likely be enjoyed most by adults, simply because haute cuisine, Paris culture, and upperclass culinary arts, are not typical areas of interest for grilled cheese eating toddlers and tykes.Negative - a lot of slapping, irresponsibility with guns, and wine (although that is accurate for the setting). This didn't offend me, but may bother some with kids.Positive - it was purely entertaining and well crafted. Also, they did not get into the world of crude/rude jokes (Shrek style), but told a wonderful story about friendship, loyalty, trust, hard work, perseverance, not taking credit for someone else's work, and honesty.The characters - Collette is a dynamic woman, someone you might now. The friendship between Linguini and Remy is beautiful and touching. Skinner is diabolical. The culinary critic seems to be straight out of the Adam's Family. Nearly all characters are eccentric... but all weave into the story perfectly.Overall - well done!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great CGI doesn't pull this film's chesnuts off the flambe.,"I must concede, when you think about old Disney films - the requirement to suspend disbelief was always paramount. Take 'Lady & The Tramp', say - two dogs, having a romantic, candlelit dinner and being serenaded by a couple of Italian Chefs. No bottoms are sniffed at anytime, and nobody looks in danger of being neutered against their will... Yet, I loved it, I would say 'at the time' but the truth is that I still kinda love this old time Disney schmaltz. You know why?...Because, despite the ridiculous situations and prepositions, they STILL pull it off. If only for a second, they have carried you away somewhere on their whimsy, and lost you in the elaborate fantasy. There shouldn't, therefore, be any problem in taking this concept a little further down the food chain. After all, if you can love stray dogs once you realise they have feelings too, its surely only another leap of faith to love the rat that wants to cook your dinner. Really?! Try watching this film WHILST eating your dinner, and then come back and tell me it was a great idea. And, therein, is where I believe the problem lies - plausibility.This film is, at times, either VERY plausible or not quite enough. Sometimes its even both at the same time. Whilst being an achievement in itself, this creates a nightmare dichotomy between some of the very best CGI to be seen anywhere before, and some of the very WORST character development and storytelling in Disney history. The realism of a rats perspective- including sense of scale, angles, the movement of us humans looming overhead etc is a small wonder to behold. Oddly enough, the development for the subsidiary characters actually seemed more rounded than the main ones. Of those I enjoyed most were the shady Sous Chefs and Chef De Parties, and also the Old Lady in the beginning. To true Disney tradition, their stylised figures and expressions, uttered delightful snippets of comical dialogue. All of which, were beautifully rendered and animated. This was alongside only, the movement of the rats themselves, which is almost unnervingly lifelike. To be honest, disturbingly so- in light of the saccharin sweet morality tale being told here. This, for me, is where it all becomes beyond the joke. If you could imagine a liberally- sensitive sitcom funded by the Bible Channel about a cute family of botulism microbes that escape the factory in a carton of Petit Filous, then you're more than halfway towards understanding how literally hard to swallow Ratatouille is. Its more interesting how acute the story's desire is to not offend anyone's beliefs, to the point where even the concept of ghosts is meticulously avoided, in favour of Gusteau being only a 'figment of Remy's imagination'. This kind of compromise only serves to dilute the concept further.Don't get me wrong, if you're gonna animate rats then they SHOULD look and move like rats...but please don't imbue one with the on screen personality and moral virtue of Tom Hanks and expect me to swallow that garbage. If I must- then please sprinkle some Warfarin on the piece of crap telling me that the rat discovers two magic clumps of Remy's hair that directly control his arms like joysticks.... Its a pity Brad Bird hadn't made an equally magical couple of discoveries when selecting his writing team. Even one with an idea of keeping a story tight and accessible to all ages would have been a Godsend - sorry Divine Intervention of a Figment Of My Imagination Instructing Me To Do The Right Thing By My Fellow Creatures-Send. And to bring all this Old Testament style righteousness kicking and screaming to the last century, there's always the addition of the lone female character that's had to fight her way up in a man's world, a well-worn - but by no means tired device, and hopefully guaranteed to please a good proportion of one's target audience...the gender friendly scatter-gun.Surprising though it may sound, Its not been my complete aim to spoil this movie, or indeed, include any spoilers. There are many visual merits to this movie most of which seem to take place in the first half...these are well worth viewing and for this reason I have given it a 4. If you make it to the end without leaving the room/hitting the 'fast forward' button then you have my eternal admiration.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Another Home Run For Disney/Pixar,"Though I have thoroughly enjoyed every Disney/Pixar film released in past years, some titles stand out more than others in my mind. ""The Incredibles,"" for instance is my personal favorite. Still, last summer, when I saw ""Cars"" I was not enormously ""wowed"" by it. I felt that Disney/Pixar might have been going downhill, and the preview for this film was no thrill. However, I am pleased to say that ""Ratatouille"" has brought it back.Unlike its predecessors, ""Ratatouille"" does not boast big actors for its voices. Still, I found that this took away nothing from the experience. Instead of puzzling over whose voice each character had, I could sit and simply enjoy the film, which is absolutely terrific. The plot centers around Remy, an adorable rat with extreme culinary talent, who is separated from his family and winds up in Paris, at his idol's restaurant, ""Le Restaurant de Chef Gusteau."" He joins up with Linguini, a garbage boy with no talent in cooking. The two form a secret partnership in which Linguini provides a home and food for Remy, while Remy controls Linguini in the kitchen of the restaurant, cooking up a storm. The result of this madness? It's hilarious and I won't even attempt to describe it.The characters in the story are surprisingly multi-dimensional. Some of my favorites were Colette- a feisty and talented feminist cook, the scheming and treacherous new chef of the restaurant, and others.It's fantastic, and though not the best of the films in its category, it is priceless for all ages. See it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A progression for cgi animated movies,"Ratatouille - Alright, this movie really surprised me, but I also wasn't too surprised that it did with legendary Brad Bird behind the movie. First of all I'd like to congratulate this movie and Brad Bird for trying to break the mold of animation and the preconceived notion that it's only for kids. This movie has an adult vibe to it; little kids probably won't know whats going on half the time and won't understand half of the words. And I love it because of that. If you liked The Incredibles you will probably like the way this movie was done.Second of all, the story and character development are outstanding. I haven't really seen characters (such as Remy and Linguini) progress and develop so much within a movie. Their character changes after all of the events and its great -- very realistic.You know the endless flood of terrible GCI movies coming out lately that never seem to get any better? Ratatouille isn't one of them. Almost no pop-culture references are to be found, which is very refreshing with all of the Dreamworks crap coming out lately (Shark Tale anyone?). I hate it how movies these days try to cash in on the latest Hollywood gossip and pop-culture and every CGI movie coming out never trays far from the Shrek-ified mold. Like Richard Roeper said, Ratatouille is actually going to be timeless because of this.This movie had comedy and great storyboard work galore. It wasn't over-the-top funny like Transformers, but it was more of a controlled and fitting type of humor -- it didn't distract from the story too much and it made sense. The scenes were well presented and the camera following the rat through all those little pathways was amazing. It may not have had very much noise and action, but it was definitely a finely crafted delicacy (pardon the pun) of a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

One of the animations that everyone should watch.,"Ratatouille is one of the best animation films I've watched. I watched this one when I was a kid and even I've grown up, I still love to watch it. It's totally amazing.I don't know exactly that some people could enjoy the meal even if they already knew that it's done by a mouse. I mean mice are the dirtiest animals of all. They carry diseases. That's why they restricted mice in the restaurant. The kitten is somewhere to make foods and foods need to be clean. So, it's kind of bad thing that mice are in the kitten. It's the worst that such mice are making food. Who will eat that? But luckily, there's someone.All in all, Ratatouille is something that is highly enjoyable because of it's fine animation quality and all. I totally love this animation very much.

It certainly doesn't belong in the top 250. That's pure crazy! I actually quit eating my popcorn after a while into the movie. Even Incredibles was much better than this film.

"The closest Pixar will get to an ""Artistic"" film","Ratatouille is such a great film for not having that appealing of a concept. A rat wants to learn how to cook. On the surface it sounds really boring, but how it is executed proves that Pixar can make just about anything interesting. I believe that this is the closest they will get to an ""artistic"" film, because of how faithful the entire thing felt to cooking while delivering a super rich message. This isn't to insult their other films, in fact I love just about all of Pixar's films.
The plot takes many unexpected twists and turns that make you want to keep watching. I love how self aware yet twisted the villain is, as it adds to the comedy and enriches his behavior. In fact all of the characters seem to leave a lasting impression on the audience, even the side characters.
This film is defiantly the most ""adult"" pixar has gotten. It doesn't feel like something made specifically for kids who would care less about plot development and character arcs, because this film is filled with them. The ending just about proves this by describing one of the main quotes of this film, ""anyone can cook"", through a critic's interpretation. Anton Ego's speech is one of my favorite scenes in all of film for having such truthful and inspiring dialogue overlayed with an artistic montage of the beautiful city of Paris.

Anyone can cook.,"Yet another masterpiece from Pixar. I mean seriously, I can't believe I forgot how good these movies were. I had most of these first 10 Pixar films at an 8/10, but my rating for almost all of them have gone up since I've rewatched them. This one specifically, is so much better than I remember. As a child, I don't think I understood the ending as much as I do now. Pixar was way more advanced than I could've possibly perceived as a child. I also couldn't relate to Ego's nostalgic influence when he ate the ratatouille as a kid, but now I understand. This truly is one of the better Pixar films. For nostalgia reasons, I have a few so called ""worse"" films above it (like Cars). But on a technical level, this is one of the best things Pixar has ever and possibly will ever make.

Worthy Of All The Pandemic Hype,"During the Covid pandemic, this movie received renewed attention as social media dwellers decided to construct an online musical around it. It's not every movie that can spark this kind of revival a decade and a half after its release - but Ratatouille is definitely not any movie. The tale of a little rat with big dreams of becoming a chef is as heartwarming, funny and touching as the day it was released. More impressively, the computer animation still looks beautiful and stunning - no small feat, considering the constant evolution of animation technology. The film's message - ""Not everyone can be a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere"" - is profoundly inspirational and has lost none of its punch.

Brad Bird is my master now,"I had heard nothing but good reviews going into Ratatouille, written and directed by Brad Bird. Much like going to a fine restaurant, I was expecting to be impressed. Even though my expectations were high, I was totally blown away by what was served up on the silver screen.Although it's an animated movie, this is NOT a movie made for or directed at kids, although there's enough slapstick and action that kids will enjoy this. It is an extremely well-made movie, with amazing sets, characters, and story, that can stack up against any live-action movie out there.The attention to detail is amazing. From the peeling paint on the shutters of a French cottage, to the cityscape of Paris, to the innards of a French kitchen, the world feels real. And, many of the scenes, which are shot from a rat's-eye point of view, are both frenetic and fascinating to watch.This movie was perfectly cast. Peter O'Toole as a pompous food critic is especially delightful to watch, although it took me until the end of the movie to figure out who was voicing that character. And Linguini, one of the main protagonists, is as tall and thin as his noodle's namesake, a picture of teenage awkwardness.The story is a classic coming-of-age story. Well, sort of. Here, a young adult must find his place in the world, and leave the nest--literally. The main twist, of course, is he's a rat, but there are other surprises in this story which keep the story as fresh as a just-picked sprig of Rosemary.Brad Bird, I salute you for continuing to elevate the genre of animation to an art form that's on par with any movie out there. At the heart of your story is the idea that dreams, even the ones that seem impossible, can come true. Here's to my dream that Ratatouille wins an Oscar--not for Best Animated Feature, but for Best Picture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
OUTSTANDING INCREDIBLE MOVIE,"Remember how everyone was talking about Toy Story when it first came out? The incredible visuals, unique style, vividly imagined world? The next time people were talking that way with such enthusiasm about a computer animated movie was Finding Nemo. I'm excited to say that Ratatouille will be the next one to redefine the visual creativity and technical detail of computer animated movies. Honest to goodness, I was awestruck by the animation, and that never happens to me. It is a visual masterpiece of a movie if ever the term applies.The next thing to talk about is the ""genre"" of the movie. As Pixar enthusiasts will tell you, Brad Bird, the director of Ratatouille, also directed The Incredibles, which has the most inspired and creative action sequences from any of the Pixar movies. Ratatouille, while not so straightforward with its action, has almost as much as The Incredibles did, in unique ways. Most memorable is the shotgun scene near the beginning. (You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it). Other than that, this is the expected comedy-with-heart movie from Pixar that so many have grown to love.The voice acting? Spot on. Every voice is distinctive, and it never feels like a celebrity's voice tacked on to a character (Shrek, I'm looking at you), it feels like the characters themselves speaking. You can't ask for more from voice acting.And finally, the script and the story. The entire irony of the story -- a street rat with a passion for fine food -- is beautiful, and a tight, smart, wonderful script flows from this. The pacing of the story is odd and choppy at places, but this is a very forgivable grievance. The only other minor fault is that a few of the dramatic one-liners feel a bit forced. Other than that, this is the most layered, complex, and satisfying script from Pixar since The Incredibles.Overall, I recommend that everyone see this movie when it hits theaters (I was lucky enough to see a pre-release screening). Though not perfect, it is an animated masterpiece in true Pixar form with breathtaking animation and visual design.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Pixar gem about the Arts,"Few animated films can boast a script as matured as Ratatouille. More suited for adults than kids, Ratatouille at its heart is about a character coming-of-age who pursues his dreams in an unsympathetic world. Pixar's magic continues by taking high concepts such as culinary arts into a family-friendly outing that delivers goods and drama. Accompanied by terrific visuals and soundtrack Ratatouille is a blast and thoroughly enjoyable.Ratatouille is an excellent film, but not without its faults. The story is engrossing when Remy, the rat cook, is the focus but drags when Linguini, the human partner of Remy, takes center stage. Due to its fast pace, the comedy often overtakes the emotional beats by failing to present introspection, especially in the first hour. The film hits its peak when the story shifts to Remy's family in the second half.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Brilliance.,"Ratatouille is, in a word, brilliant. Just about everything in this movie is flawless. You would think that with so many great Pixar films, it can't get much better, but this movie proves it can. The animation is borderline unbelievable, literally. It was dazzling. The attention to detail is astounding. The voice acting shows nothing but great talent. The concept is clever and humorous. The entertainment level is high. The script is witty.This may very well be the best animated film ever. Brad Bird is some sort of genius. If this doesn't win best animated feature at the Academy Awards, which at this point seems insane, it will make me very angry.I feel this film can be enjoyed by just about anyone. See it, I promise you, anyone, that you will enjoy it or at least admire it for being so beautiful (in animation).10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Over rated, maybe because I'm an England fanatic","Yup, Paris does nothing for me; the food, the sights, the snobbery. Yes, the message is true, we all can be creative, spiritual, yada yada. However, beware, when all the movie critics fall in love with a movie, there must be some intellectual elitism going on.Pixar and Brad Bird strike out on this one. My 2 kids said: it was OK and it was good. I almost fell asleep.It took forever to get to the moral of the story. Movie was draggy, repetitive, etc. Animation was excellent but that can't carry a movie any more.Lastly, I hate it when everybody tells me that I should love a movie because it's made by them (be it Pixar, Bird, Disney, etc).PS - Damn, people really don't like this review.

Inspiring,"""Ratatouille"" (2007) is a professionally produced animated adventure comedy about a rat named Remy, voiced by Patton Oswalt, who has an uncanny ability to cook and an aspiration to become Paris' top Chef. Remy, through coincidence and direction from the spirit of famous Chef Gusteau, voiced by Brad Garrett, meets Linguini, voiced by Lou Romano, and forms an alliance between rat and human. I have watched this film several times now and every time I get this warm feeling in my heart. This animation provides a very real sense that there is an ability to separate the differences between entities to share commonalities. The story is very strong and realistic. In the film, the scenario is applied to a despised animal and a human, but the same scenario can be applied to the race, gender and sexual orientation that plague the world today. The vocal acting compared to the visuals is spot on. I never felt like anything was out of place. I commend directors Brad Bird and Jan Pinkava for bringing this work to life and delivering such a powerful message through, what most people consider, a ""kids movie."" I love this film and recommend to everyone to watch at least twice.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Superb film, holds up over time","Ratatouille is yet another masterpiece of Brad Bird. Most of his earlier films (before he became politically correct) are works of art (iron giant, the incredibles).
Ratatouille is a very clever juxtaposition between artists and critics and about following your passions. It sticks true to its values and doesn't get itself sidetracked with sex politics (like he did in Tomorrow Land and Incredibles 2 - where his focus concentrated on the genitals of the characters rather than a deeply clever story).
Disney has had its issues in the past (see the mouse that roared). However, until a few years ago Disney had never taken to marginalising most of its audience.
As a conscientious family, we are now going back to the older (pre politically correct) classics like Ratatouille to avoid Disney's modern shenanigans targeting little children.
While Disney and Brad Bird have let us down in recent years, there are still superb movies such as Ratatouille that conscientious parents can watch instead. Ratatouille and the original incredibles are definitely worth revisiting.
As for Disney ... watch the new Wreck It Ralph 2 trailer and ask yourself : inclusive? Divisive? Rubbishing all of the Disney princesses as ""victims"" and to all of the children who lived the Disney princesses in one swoop? That's a master stoke of something. It's up to you to decide what that something is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
My Favourite Animation Movie,"I love animation films, even when usually they are made for much younger audience then me, filled with physical humor, fart jokes and childish non sense.
but this one, this film is simply a masterpiece.
The script is great, smart and optimistic in view. the characters are nuanced, and each of the main characters (both protagonists and antagonists) has their own arch. they learn, they evolve, and all change by the end of the movie.
The animation is beautiful and detailed, especially considering it was made 12 years ago.
The score / music is great and fitting the location. I watched it countless times and will continue to do so every year till i'm old and grey. A heart-warming feel good movie.
Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Bird's Rat -- Memorable Movie Night Part 1: The Animated Movie,"One night, three great movies. Let's start with the appetizer: Ratatouille.This family fun, yet mainly mature, sweet and sarcastic tale is Brad Bird's reserved creation. Even if in Paris, the setting is dingy and involves rats in a kitchen. Yet, Bird is the one to receive an original screenplay Oscar nomination for ""Incredibles, The (2004)"", an animated movie about superheroes. Even so, it comes as a pleasant surprise to see Bird's writing and directing easily transcend this potentially contrived plot and make a funny and heartfelt movie in almost every aspect. The message it carries is positive and poetic and the film is forgiven its occasional slapstick comedy moments or predictability to (hopefully) make it slightly more appealing to the younger audience and thus more marketable.The initial introduction and characterization had me entertained, but slightly worried, but once the film got rolling, I was pretty much enthralled throughout: out-loud laughing, smiling or fighting a tear. A feel good movie and a good story. Don't expect Shrek's flatulence or average talking-animal humour. Expect more of the witty humour from The Incredibles, minus the action, plus a bit more depth in dialogue and human soul-searching. Disney's magic? Well, this film has the intangible that makes it all work together.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The best animated film ever,"What a film, really creative concept based off of one phrase, 'anyone can cook.' whilst that statement isn't exactly true, it helps the film develop as one of the most beautiful, engaging animated films ive ever seen. The detail is unbelievable, the wide shot of paris is one of the best reveals in cinema history, you'd be hard done to find a better animated film, you have to watch ratatouille, you'll feel much better that you did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Ratatouille was a disaster for every age group with few laughs.,"Simply the most boring children's animated movie, Ratatouille focuses on the contrasting visual perspectives of a rat and a teenage boy and attempts to draw most of it's humour from here. The comedy did not exist within the story itself... the joke of a rat assisting a teenage boy's cooking skills wears off after a few minutes. You can dissect the movie and delve into discussion around it's wonderful cinematography and attempts at being innovative with POV camera angles etc. but I think this is another film that reflects changing attitudes towards cinema that are quite dangerous for the industry. Production companies are putting far too much emphasis on captivating audiences with technical 'cleverness' rather than telling an interesting story. The reason for Toy Story's success is obvious. Not only was the animation absolutely enthralling, the story constantly held us in suspense with a variey of fascinating characters. Ratatouille not only holds on to themes and catch phrases for far too long, with the annoying 'anyone can cook' statement, it creates an extremely unrealistic relationship between animal and man through a very week scene of a boy discovering the capabilities of a rat. Anyone with even the most powerful imagination will be unable to accept their interaction, and a voice in their mind will scream out 'far fetched' throughout most of the film.Ratatouille was a disaster for every age group with few laughs.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Great film/animation...,"Just went to see ""Ratatouille"" and found it to be thoroughly enjoyable.I've long since grown tired of Hollywood's reliance on bloated special effects, gratuitous violence and sex, coupled with a remedial story line. ""Ratatouille"" shines as a sterling example of creativity coupled with a quality story that relies more on following traditional, thoughtful writing. The animation's detail--such as the kitchen scenes--was surprisingly accurate and lended a sense of believability to the story, as well.Thank you for producing an enjoyable film; I look forward to seeing it again in the future.Great work!!!

"Keep in mind - I liked this movie, but my criticisms are mostly negative because I expect more from Pixar","Good, but not at the level that I expect from Pixar. It's always fun, but it's often in danger of feeling slight. Besides the awesome setpiece of Remy, the gourmand rat, entering Gusteau's kitchen for the first time and the wonderful climax, there is little that is memorable. The characters are also pretty generic, except for food critic Anton Ego, voiced by Peter O'Toole, and Colette, voiced by an unrecognizable Jeneane Gorofolo. Remy is dull, as are a lot of cartoon heroes (they're hardly ever the most memorable characters), and the other rats don't have enough screen time to make an impression. The villainous chef is a dull bad guy, and Luigi, the human who is helped by Remy, is never redeemed by the script. Even in the end, that character has taken advantage of Remy. He admits that to the other characters, but doesn't do much to make up for it. I would actually have ranked Disney's CGI film, Meet the Robinsons, above this, but the climax is so wonderful, and the aftermath so beautiful, that I ultimately felt very pleased, despite only being moderately so for the other 90 minutes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Ratatouille: a rat's tale too long!,"Normally I do not venture out to see animated films because I am usually disappointed. Ratatouille was a pleasant surprise for the first sixty minutes. Director Brad Bird who also wrote the screenplay weaves an excellent adult fantasy up until that point. Sadly this 110 minute film could have been cut to 87 and Ratatouille would have been far more digestible. This is a movie about life, food, and new found relationships all working together to keep the human and animal spirit evolving. The animation is excellent. Pixar does magical film work, especially on a large screen when 2D becomes 3D. The colors, the depth, and the pure movie magic is completely captivating. Too much seasoning can foul the taste of the broth, too much time spent on needless scenes, drags out this film. Parents, this is not a film for children because it is made for an adult audience. There are only bits and pieces of cute scenes that your small fry will truly understand or comprehend. The actors who dub the voices of the main characters do an excellent job. How can you go wrong with such luminaries as Ian Holm, Brian Dennehy, Peter O'Toole, and Janeane Garofalo. Where Ratatouille sours is that it tries to choke itself on it's own recipe.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Rat's Life,"First there were toys. Then there were bugs. Then there were one eyed green things with Billy Crystal's voice. Then there were automobiles. Pixar has asked us many favours over the years and we have all happily, gladly and willingly obliged. Empathise with the things in this world least likely to be empathised with. Inanimate objects. Insects. Now - rodents. Pixar have succeeded in everything so far, but rats must always have been tricky. Specifically, we're talking semi-real world rats, in a semi-real world setting. In this case, a kitchen.It is a testament to Pixar's genius that I even mention having a problem with this. Most of the little animated cuties in films like Basil the Great Mouse Detective or The Rescuers etc are set apart from all other vermin by being distinctly cuddly and humanoid. Basil, for one, was Sherlock Holmes, wearing human clothes and adapting the rodent underworld into a human-like environment. But in this case, we're dealing with Brad Bird, director of The Incredibles, who gives us little gems of nuance to give his animated reality an identifiable sheen. The Incredibles, for example, is as preposterous as Sky High, yet includes such themes as bored in the office, family troubles and the like. His storytelling is unique and the animated world is so very layered that it is lifted high above some of the child fodder put out by Fox animation and, ahem, IDT Entertainment. It is this that gives Ratatouille some of it's magic.Yes, these rats talk, but only to each other. All human ears can hear is squeaking. But really, this movie does not delude itself or it's audience. These are cute and cuddly rats, but nevertheless, rats in the kitchen are disgusting. So, once you get past that aspect, you can begin to invest. The plot involves a rat named Remy who loves good food and likes to experiment with cooking. A chance meeting with a young man named Linguini in a restaurant kitchen causes them to team up and begin cooking together, garnering acclaim. I won't tell anymore than that because it's much more fun to find out for yourself.The film's voice talents are spot on. The trick here is that no-one is particularly recognisable (aside from Peter O'Toole who is absolutely marvellous as usual). In animated films such as Shark Tale, the focus is taken off the story in favour of showcasing Jack Black! Will Smith! Angelina Jolie! much to the detriment of the final product (the excessive pop culture referencing is enough already as well). In this movie, the story is it's own boss, even going so far as to continue to be real-world even in light of certain ridiculous developments (which are a lot of fun, just ridiculous!). There is slightly less laughter than one might expect, but it's not really noticeable as everything else is so absorbing. The existing one liners however never miss (""we don't mean to be rude, but we're French!""). The animation, shown up wonderfully on the crisp, clear DVD (that's normal DVD, HD can kiss my butt) is perfect, showing Shrek the Third up easily. So, my only comment would be the slow start. Normally these movies get better when I watch them again, so maybe opinion will change. Until then, any further analysing would be overkill. It's a cartoon after all, and a damn entertaining one at that. Now, who's hungry?",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Best Pixar movie yet!,"I registered on this website just to post a comment on this movie. I won't post any spoilers, but will say that this movie is by far the best movie released by Pixar.

(Not to mention the fact that my husband and I are in our mid-20's and we also both love this film). I wish I had seen it sooner!

Thoroughly enjoyable,"I don't mind watching kids animated movies so long as they look good, there's a reasonable story and a few jokes for me to giggle at, and I'm pleased to report this movie scores on all three points.As I'm sure you already know this is about a rat who wants to cook excellent food. The characters are distinctive, delightful and well defined in terms of both animation and voice acting. The animation is as good as anything I've ever seen.If there's a problem, it's that some aspects of the story are a little formulaic in that our heroes 'let each other down a bit and then redeem themselves', which seems to be a standard plot device in animated kids movies these days, and in this case not entirely believable.

A Beautiful Tale That Couldn't Be Better,"This film mesmerized me in so many ways, and I feel fairly certain you will feel the same if you have any appreciation for animation (though I have faith that those apathetic to the animated genre will still find much to enjoy). I have been a student of animation, both traditional and 3D, for many years now, and Ratatouille really blew my mind.My ability to suspend disbelief was completely involuntary; for instance, I was saddened to see the list of voice actors who took part in the film. Though I knew nearly every one of the top fifteen actors, I recognized none of their voices on my first or second viewings (not that I couldn't pinpoint Patton Oswalt's voice from a crowded room, just that the tale's seamless creation of its virtual world didn't leave me thinking about such things). Each character so perfectly matches their voice- a feat that can be accredited to the modelers, the animators, and the voice actors alike- that you won't feel like famous voice actors were ever involved. The story is heartwarming, original, and hilarious: altogether encompassing everything I could possibly ask for in a comedy.Ratatouille has the kind of story that is so often cut short by a ridiculous ending that either breaks the illusion of reality or leaves you with an unsatisfactory resolution that makes you replace your love of the rest of the film with your dislike of the end. Ratatouille's ending succeeds in creating neither of these endings; in fact, I daresay the ending is my favorite part.The soundtrack, while limited, fits the film so perfectly, and the one lyrical track of note, being Le Festin by Camille, is as fantastic and memorable as the film itself.The environments manage to be both perfectly believable and cartoon enough to not supersede the characters' styles.Overall, I believe this is my favorite Disney film to date, above so many other beloved treasures.
