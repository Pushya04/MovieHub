Loving you is like loving part of my life,"This movie is infinitely close to when we were young: arrogant, romantic, dreamy, longing for love, but lack of money. Then when we have tasted the hardships and pains of society and finally achieved something, is the person around you still the one you love the most? Only when you have thoroughly pained and loved, can you understand how difficult it is to be innocent love. Only when you let go can you support your dream and fulfill your pursuit. In the end, Mia's fantasy surprised all the audience. This is the fantasy of all sweet love, and it is the most exciting meaning of this movie. I dare say that if there is no final fantasy, or the hero and heroine are together again, this movie will eventually become a second-rate love song and dance drama. Only if you can't get it, can you fully understand the bitterness and sweetness of youth. After all, the most beautiful love is just a flash in the pan. I love you, but I can only wish you happiness. This is the supreme love. This love becomes a part of life and a belief. LA LA LAND, loving you is like loving part of my life.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
I hate musicals,"I watched this as Oscar's had been handed out and I felt it necessary, as is customary - to grant such films my valuable time.I hate musicals.It started as we know in a traffic jam.

A true ode to the Golden Era of Hollywood,"The vibrant colors and use of musical scores to set the mood for scenes transported myself back in time. This movie feels not only like a beautifully nostalgic nod to Hollywood of yesteryear, but also that of a timeless love story. Gosling and Stone have a charm to their chemistry on screen during the musical and dance numbers. All these aspects lead to a raw portrayal of love that many experience in life, with still providing a sense of hope and wonder to the viewers. I was entranced from the opening scene until the final note played by Goslings piano. I absolutely recommend this film to any and everyone!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

"Like a dream come true, one of those films that totally banishes the blues away","Having just gotten back from seeing 'La La Land', with a rare day off music college, it came to me that it was one of the best new release/first viewings for me in a while.Very few films in recent memory has left me leave the cinema with my heart properly warmed, a beaming smile on my face, tears in my eyes, feeling uplifted and properly moved. 'La La Land' however has managed that feat. Would also go further to say that it is one of the best modern film musicals after Disney's Renaissance period in the 90s, and very much a modern classic. Am not surprised at all its award wins and nominations (including being a record breaker at the Golden Globes), and if it does well at the Oscars as well there will be no complaints from me.'La La Land' clicked with me most likely because of my love for golden age Hollywood, musicals (a somewhat maligned genre these days, but while there are a fair share of not particularly good ones there are a bigger number of great ones and even masterpieces), and how it fondly reminded me of what makes me love them so much. Also because of being able to relate to its themes and conflicts, due to being there myself. The talent was also appetising, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, directed by 'Whiplash's' Damien Chazelle and featuring cameo support from JK Simmons (who coincidentally won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for 'Whiplash), John Legend and Rosemarie DeWitt.It was just sheer joy to see a film with so much potential deliver on that potential and even more so, having seen a lot of stuff recently film and TV that wasted their potential it was refreshing to see a film actually delivering on it.Visually, 'La La Land' is a gorgeous-looking film, with lots of vibrant colour that leap out at you from the screen while not having too much of a dizzying effect and cinematography that's not just a dream to behold but inventively done without falling into self-indulgent territory. The music and songs may induce, and has induced, mixed reactions, count me in as somebody who found the songs infectious, emotion-filled and with enough to make one top-tap and hum along.The musical numbers are winningly choreographed too with non-stop exuberance. The opening number is especially true to this. The script is warm, funny, affectionate and poignant, and also with an honesty. It's not a complex script, nor did it need to be, and neither does it make the mistake of being too simple. The story is admittedly slight in places, then again so were the stories of even the best golden age musicals and they still managed to be classics because of how everything else was executed and because of the atmosphere.Something that is true with 'La La Land', a film where anybody can relate to its themes. Even more special though is that not only does it pay tribute to musicals and films of the golden age (especially those with MGM), with their bold colour, exuberant marriage of music and dance, it also has a winsomeness and melancholic nature seen in films like 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' yet does it in a way that will appeal hugely to modern audiences. Loved that the two leads' relationship and chemistry was much more complex than the love-at-first-sight sort (far from it, more antagonists turned lovers) with a meet cute first encounter (again also not a case).Chazelle's direction shows someone with a sheer love for film and film-making, more than evident in execution that is affectionate and full-of-life rather than self-indulgent. The chemistry between the two leads and their performances would need to be good to make the film work. No worries there. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone look so natural and at ease together, nothing looks false and it is easy to root for them and their conflicts.Both of them give terrific performances, performances so good that less than great singing was immediately forgotten about. Especially Stone who has never been better in a performance of great expressivity and nuance, so many emotions such as vulnerability, strength, cheekiness, charm and buoyancy with never a hint of a heavy-handed touch. Gosling matches her, if not quite as good, showing a very charismatic presence and an effortless twinkling charm. All the support, although basically cameos, registers memorably.All in all, a dream come true and totally banishes any blues and daily troubles away. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

A Classic Romantic Hollywood Mastepiece,"La La Land stands as a cinematic spectacle. 
From the opening scene you can understand that this movie is not messing around, this scene delivers amazing feelings and prepares you for an emotional roller-coaster throughout the film. It is a pure Hollywood love story that has been portrayed by two amazingly talented actors. 
The movie circles around two options. Either choose love or choose dreams. At the end of the film you will surely understand what the two protagonists choose and why they chose it, again shown in a beautiful way. It takes influence from movies like ""Singing in the Rain"" and demonstrates some iconic scenes in a new modern way that makes you feel nostalgic about the classic one. It is so perfectly crafted, but what makes this movie unique from any other romantic movies is its ending. That ending. Not only does it deliver some extremely emotional scenes but it changes the whole idea you had for the film. 
Also, in a musical the music needs to be stunning for it to be successful. For the first time in a movie, I have cried so loudly when hearing a song. This soundtrack gives you the feels. It is a masterpiece from song one until the very last song. 
The film is ultimately everything it had the potential to be - an unashamedly romantic musical, infused not only with great song and dance numbers but with intense emotion and charisma from Gosling/Stone, wonderful visuals and a unique pacing and tension from Chazelle. Oh, and it's hilarious throughout too. A genuine achievement - must be one of the best films I've seen in a long while.

"Great production value, but painfully boring and overrated.","This movie is so overrated. It has great production value, but it kind of ends there. The movie is a musical, but half way through it decides to suddenly stop being a music and just turns into a boring drama with a dull plot. Although the movie started with decent momentum, it quickly just falls apart and gets really boring in the second half of the movie.Musicals often don't have very strong plots, but makeup for it with music. La La Land did not do this. Instead they just have a few songs and a boring plot. Also, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were terrible choices for this movie. They both are mediocre singers (especially Gosling) and terrible dancers (the dancing scene seemed so forced and unnatural). There are literally thousands of amazing theater actors and singers out there, but for some reason they chose two people who have zero experience in show theater. Makes no sense.Critics need to stop judging movies based on production value. This movie was mediocre at best and doesn't deserve any special recognition.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"Nostalgic, Colourful, Joyous CinemaScope Magic","Do I like musicals? Not really... but damn, 'La La Land' is a nostalgic, colourful, joyful marvel!Damien Chazelle gained international acclaim and recognition from his masterful drama 'Whiplash', what were the chances that he could pull off similar success two times in the row? Well, if 'La La Land' is anything to go by, then I'd say he did the job. With just three films under his belt as of 2016, Chazelle is slowly becoming the next big thing this movie industry has seen. His passion for classic movies and musicals is evident as he references and pulls influence from films like 'Singin' in the Rain', 'The Umbrellas of Cherborg' and even 'Rebel Without a Cause', the latter of which is one of my favourite films so seeing the nod to it was something I was pleased about.The chemistry between Gosling and Stone is strong to say the least, after two previous collaborations, their already-strong bond helped them become one of modern-day cinema's finest couples. The music is bouncy and toe-tapping catchy, the cinematography is utterly stunning with gorgeous colours and impressive long takes, and the locations sum up the American dream and the passion the characters hold for Los Angeles. 'La La Land' is by far one of the finest cinema experiences I have had in the past 5-10 years, and although this isn't a film I would typically enjoy (genre-wise), Chazelle has instead crafted one of my favourite films of this decade. A film I would recommend everyone see in the cinema to truly witness the CinemaScope magic.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Love letter to Hollywood .. and a Heck of a Film,"Writer/Director Damien Chazelle, who already had a nice career going for him, explodes into the Bigtime with this delightful, mesmerizing, and completely unexpected ode to Tinseltown.The opening sequence (satirized on the Golden Globes) really does not do the rest of the film justice. It is as if the cast from the FAME remake grew up, had children of their own, and then those children hijacked the Santa Monica freeway to do a 10 minute flash-mob dance sequence.From that point on, the film is hypnotic.We segue to a love story as pure as anything since the great dramas of the 1940s. If the film had been in B&W, you would almost have expected to see Bette Davis in a 3-hankie tear jerker.Except for the musical interludes, of course, which are pitch perfect and totally wonderful.Gosling is surprising as a leading man expected to do song and dance, but he delivers the goods.Stone, who was supposed to be ""the next big thing"" after Easy A (2010), steals the film and possibly the hearts of the audience as well. The awards should flow like water, and she will deserve every one.As I said, deep in the DNA this is an ode to Hollywood. The film industry has always had issues with endings -- back in the day they would film several different endings per picture -- and then decide at the last minute which to use. Here Chazelle pays homage to that by giving us an alternate ending, along with the ""real"" ending, along with a closing sequence designed to remind everyone that nothing in Hollywood is actually real, but everything still can be really fun.Destined to be a classic.

Very Well Made But Not My Kind Of Movie,"Did someone say last year's Oscars were too white ? So let's award most of this year's Oscars to something that looks like an explosion in a paint factory where every primary colour is splashed across the screen . LA LA LAND was being touted as the film to beat even before most of the other contenders were announced and its domination at the Golden Globes confirmed everything . Looks like the 2017 Oscars will be the most predictable event of this yearRomantic musicals aren't my thing so my dread was realised in the opening scene with a California highway turning in to a song and dance scene so camp I thought I was watching a forest of pink tents which hints at what you're going to get - feelgood factor whether you want it or not . It was at this point I seriously considered giving up on the movie and going on youtube to listen to proper love songs by the likes of The The and Joy DivisionAs the film continued the narrative did expose itself to being what you expect , two young people , a man and a woman , who are embarking on fulfilling their careers in respectively jazz music and acting . There's not a lot here we haven't seen before but what sells this movie is the visual work director Damien Chazelle has put in to it . The language of cinema is very much to the fore especially the stunning cinematography and my abiding memory is the scene where the two protagonists meet and an impact aesthetic is instantly created by the way the lighting changes . Many scenes are similarity beautiful but if there's a fundamental problem remains that no matter how well made a film is if you've no interest in the genre then you won't become a convert . As it stands LA LA LAND will dominate the Oscars like the French film THE ARTIST did five years ago then become quickly forgotten",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Tinky Winky Land?,"Lets set the parameters. An Oscar-winning film, or any above-average picture for that matter, needs to fulfil criteria that sets it apart from the 'average'. It requires a breath of innovation, story-line, integrity and impeccable acting that levitates the subject above the norm. It needs also to vault hype and financial remuneration. To create a musical, which, I believe 'La La Land' aspires in many parts to be, there has to be a synergy between book, score and choreography. Sadly, for this viewer, not one of these three elements can be considered by any stretch of the imagination,'exceptional'. It's triumph is evident in it's cinematography and lighting, which were largely outstanding. But the remainder? The story is typical Hollywood fare - predictable without significant twists or intellectual excertion. Essentially, nothing out of the ordinary happens and the blandness creeps to a predictable end. The acting is OK. You would expect as much from someone of Gosling's ability, but I hope that one day he'll be provided with a script that alienates him from the type-casting that befell Hugh Grant, with a diversity that De Niro was astute to select. Choreography? What choreography? That brief moment with the bench is all that taunts the memory. Singing - best not go there. Marni Nixon could have played both roles.And I read today that it's up for 14 Academy nominations. Figures. Trump was successful so there's no reason this will not win.Emperor's new clothes 'n all.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
The best movie of 2016,"The main characters in this Los Angeles romantic musical are Mia (Emma Stone), a coffee-shop employee with dreams of being an actress; and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a jazz pianist who aspires to open his own club that plays jazz like it was played in the good old days.At long last: a movie released during the 2016 awards season that actually lives up to the hype!Early in the film, there are two superb group musical numbers. The numbers that follow are more low-key relating only to the main characters but they are still well performed and executed.The stories of career struggle within the broader narrative are very believable. They include the hell of auditioning to people who are too busy plus the desire to maintain the purity of a great music genre (jazz) while too often being told it is ""a dying art"".Gosling takes a while to break into the role particularly where the singing is concerned but it's not long before he fits into the part quite nicely. Stone is superb throughout the film. She is even spot-on as an actress giving mediocre auditions. She's given a full range - and not just as a triple threat - and she fully lives up to the expectations especially during the song ""Audition"" near the end.There is something uniquely enjoyable about Hollywood portraying itself. The movie also gives nods to great classic musicals like ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""Les Demoiselles de Rochefort"", and ""Les Parapluies de Cherbourg"" all the while being unique and standing out on its own. In addition, the set designs and photography add further to the film's greatness.The reference to ""Les Parapluies de Cherbourg"" comes through strongly in the movie's final number. This scene is probably the best scene of any movie in 2016. It leaves one with so many mixed emotions and extreme on either side. The production number is magnificent while its mood is melancholy.The teaming of director/writer Damien Chazelle with musical composer Justin Hurwitz is one of the best matches since Jacques Demy and Michel Legrand in the 1960s. - dbamateurcriticOUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:1) Directing by Damien Chazelle2) Acting by Emma Stone3) Music by Justin Hurwitz",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
My Most Memorable Cinematic Experience Since Star Wars - when I was six,"The last time, I felt like this, in a cinema, I was six years old and I was watching Star Wars. I never imagined, I would ever find that feeling again in a cinema. That sense of being transported to another world.The opening sequence took my breath away and I never got it back. Not even at the end - which left my head spinning. It is a beautiful film with soul, wit, charm, style and love. It is simply outrageous! Bold and fantastic and fantastical.I am a straight man but my love for Ryan Gosling could change all that. He's a melancholy genius and Emma Stone is our muse.This film defies genre.

For The Love Of Movies,"Damien Chazelle is a young director who loves and knows movies, from Federico Fellini to Jacques Demy. Hallellujah! Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone go back to inspire us forward. What's more surprising than anything else is the feel of amateurishness in the dancing in the singing. So refreshing not to have a sleek but empty experience. Damian Chazelle' Whiplash was a brilliant preview of forthcoming attractions. I would love to see a thriller directed by Chazelle, something like Shadow Of A Doubt or even a glossy damsel in distress story like Midnight Lace. That's what happens when we discover a new and startling talent. You want to see him do everything. I have a feeling this young artist will.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"City of Stars - a journey of self actualization, finding love and chasing dreams","First of all; The score in this musical is simply phenomenal.The individual tracks are well performed, catchy and does exceedingly well in captivating the feelings of our protagonists and their motivation, as well as driving the emotional story forward. I am not exaggerating, when I tell you that my top artist of 2016 on Spotify was Ryan Gosling. That's how good this movie's soundtrack is.Secondly; The acting from our lead protagonists elevates this movie above other romantic Hollywood flicks of its time. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling gives us incredibly subtle but emotionally strong performances, and their chemistry feels palpable and real (which it probably is to a degree, as they also starred together in Crazy, Stupid, Love). They do a fantastic job of capturing both the happy, whimsical and fulfilling moments of living in ""La La Land"" as well as the hardships and challenges that comes with it.Thirdly; The cinematography and overall setup is nothing but a love-letter to Los Angeles, Hollywood and filmmaking. Each scene is colourful, vibrant, and every cut feels deliberate in its presentation. This is beautifully contrasted by the themes of hardship that career paths in this world might entail. The city and the environment, in which the story takes place, is almost made to feel as a main character, which very much makes sense in the overall themes of the movie.And the overall themes are what really keeps me going back to ponder about this movie. To which degree can your career be a means to express yourself or something of an art-form? How do you navigate in the struggles of your career-path and your personal life, especially if it constantly brings you ups and downs along the way? Do your goals change as time passes? Would you trade parts of yourself to achieve your professional aspirations? How we deal with these questions, and the sacrifices we make along the way, are challenges that most people can relate to. That's why I believe, even though La La Land presents it's story and themes in the larger world of Hollywood, it brings forward interesting and universal questions to which there is no single answer. We each have to find our own way in the world, and the best we can do is to help and support each other.I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

"An unashamedly romantic musical, infused with intense charisma and devastating emotion","I was interested in seeing this film because not only am I a sucker for a good musical, but I'll admit to being a big fan of Ryan Gosling and I was intrigued to see what the director of Whiplash would do with a musical picture to make it fresh and unique. So when I had the chance to see a late-planned viewing at the London Film Festival, I jumped at the chance (FYI, Ryan Gosling came to the screening as a surprise post- film Q&A attendee despite not appearing at the Headline Gala the night before so I was chuffed!)The premise of the story is that Stone is a young actress who has moved to LA to wait tables while auditioning to try and 'make it', while Gosling is a jazz purist (""Anyone who doesn't like jazz just doesn't have the right...context"", he insists) who plays the piano in bars to make a living and dreams of opening his own Jazz bar. Or to put it succinctly - ""Two young artists meet and fall in love while chasing their dreams"". The musical flows thematically from first love to heartbreak and every other emotion between, with great music throughout.The most impressive thing about the film, for me, is just how daringly it dances between the old-fashioned ""Singing' In The Rain"" style of musical, and a bolder, modern style. The song numbers are great (the opening number received a round of applause in my viewing) and are an undoubted homage to classic musicals - a thoughtful mixture of old school dance numbers you'd expect from a musical in the 50s, and emotionally-wrenching ballads that hit you where it hurts; there is one particular sequence toward the end of the film which is a real gut-punch.Stylistically the film skirts this same line; the film again looks and acts like a classic musical but frequently we see low-key reminders that this is modern day; actresses using their iPhones, a video being seen on Youtube, etc to remind us that this is set in the present day. If we didn't have these reminders, the visuals would almost have you thinking that this is the 1950s. The cinematography is beautiful and overall the film is visually stunning. There is also no doubt that it is wonderfully directed, with the same masterful control of pace and tension that we come to expect from Damien Chazelle thanks to Whiplash.Gosling in particular is absolutely terrific, with a typically sardonic wit throughout. At the start of the film when his sister says she's worried about him as life seems to have him on the ropes, he responds ""I wanna be on the ropes. I'm just letting life think it has me and then before you know it - BAM. It's a classic rope-a-dope"". His delivery of these sorts of lines can't be matched, and it's easy to see why the producers said in the post-film Q&A that he was the person they wanted for the role in their wildest dreams. It's a role made for him with tons more of the above kind of lines. But more than that, Gosling captures a real emotional intensity at the film's emotional breaking points, more specifically in the sequence towards the end of the film that I mentioned earlier. He manages to convey such convincing emotion without so much as a word.I'd feel bad if I didn't also praise Emma Stone, who has probably never been better. She has wonderful emotional range, from the ecstatic highs of love to the tearful, painful lows.In terms of the Gosling/Stone films, this is by far the best. Their undoubted chemistry is given the full spotlight in this film with freedom to explore said chemistry without restriction.The film is ultimately everything it had the potential to be - an unashamedly romantic musical, infused not only with great song and dance numbers but with intense emotion and charisma from Gosling/Stone, wonderful visuals and a unique pacing and tension from Chazelle. Oh, and it's hilarious throughout too. A genuine achievement - must be one of the best films I've seen in a long while. I'm annoyed I'll have to wait so long to see it again, frankly.Will surely win multiple Oscars and other awards.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Cannot understand what all the hype was about,"I'm a big fan of musicals - on film and in the theater - so I had high hopes for La La Land. Combine its genre with the fact that it seemed like a love note to the great city of Los Angeles, always a rich backdrop for a film, and I was eager to see this movie.I was sorely disappointed.First, the casting of Gosling and Stone is all wrong. Neither can sing, or at least certainly not well enough to make the many musical numbers enjoyable. The dancing in the film is basic and didn't hold my attention, including in the much-lauded opening number.So, if neither Gosling nor Stone fit the bill based on their musical abilities, maybe their on-screen chemistry would explain their roles in this picture? Not even close. I couldn't believe for a second that these characters really loved one another. There was no credible romance between them; I'd go so far as to call their relationship awkward.Stone, for her part, delivers her lines very well and has much more range as an actor than Gosling, who, no matter how many movies I see him in, always seems to be playing a caricature of himself. But her talent isn't enough to save the film.Then, there is the plot. There is very little of it. The movie, clocking in at just over 2 hours, feels like 3. So little attention was paid to story, and so much paid to fetishizing mid-Century Hollywood filmmaking, that I couldn't help by feel the film dragging and stumbling from one poorly written set piece to another, without succeeding at captivating my interest at any point.For example: Gosling's character is set up as a down-and-out struggling musician without an ounce of opportunity or luck on his side. What, then, explains his seemingly effortless rise in the film as he scores a gig playing with musicians he used to swoon for as a spectator, or the way he suddenly hops into national stardom by partnering with John Legend's highly successful band? There is nothing that really explains his character's quick transition from bitter failure to jazz superstar.There is a charming final song-and-dance number in La La Land, but it comes too late to save the movie.Overall, La La Land is a half-baked pastiche of a movie with forgettable music, lackluster dancing, thin story, and insincere character development.SKIP IT!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

A nostalgic and joyful musical feast of a film.,"A nostalgic, joyful, and oh-so realistic portrayal of chasing your dreams and living in the ""la la land"" that is Los Angeles, ""La La Land"" is a different kind of masterpiece, as it pays tribute to the musical films of the 40s and 50s, the Astaire and Rogers, MGM kind of musicals, while also bringing something new to the genre, specifically the modern and original elements.Damien Chazelle was already a promising newcomer when he made 2014's ""Whiplash"", also an Oscar-winning film. ""La La Land"", however, sets the record straight that this young writer-director is a true talent and possibly one of the greatest of our time. One of the most important elements within Chazelle's script and directing is, in one word, passion. Pure passion for cinema is what it takes to make a great film, and Chazelle sure does know that.Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone sparkle as the film's leading stars on screen, like Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall and Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn once did in the golden age. In the film, Stone and Gosling's characters share the same goal: to make their dreams in both acting and jazz, respectively, come true. What comes out when you put these two acting talents together in a film is pure enjoyment and an onscreen chemistry that seems impossible to break.Overall, ""La La Land"" is one hell of a film to watch, as it may go down in cinematic history as one of the finest films made.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

First, I like both actors, I really do..But I don't think they did justice to dancing or singing.It simply didn't look real or serious enough.Either they're not talented enough or they should've work harder and longer for it...I'm not a professional dancer but you can see from the sky that the way they move their feet isn't real dancers alike! Idea of bringing old Hollywood style, step dancing and singing is brilliant but there is no much story..Scenario is somehow cheap.John Legend I love your music..But casting him was more desperate than necessary..The buzz over this movie is just so over-hyped, they're even mentioning Oscar nominations which it obviously doesn't deserve..You simply can't put this next to Titanic,The Lord of the rings or I don't know... Brave Heart or Gladiator category...It takes a better story.It needs to be more original,more breathtaking..It needs to to give you goosebumps and be something to remember! There isn't much to tell about this movie,cause even tho it wanted , this movie simply doesn't give enough! I'm sorry but it's six from me!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
A wonderful and loving ode to the dreamers and artists of the world.,"When I first saw the trailer for La La Land my expectations were set high. The excellent cast, the music and an exciting new director/writer were enough to get me in the door. I'm always a bit hesitant when it comes to filmed musicals.. Will it be stagy, stilted and awkward? Not in this case. Damien Chazelle has made a wonderfully cinematic and loving ode to the dreamers and artists of the world. Having lived in LA and worked on both sides of the camera I can relate to much of this film's endearing observations, trials and tribulations; but anyone who's ever yearned for what seems impossible and searched for true love will also easily connect with this film's gargantuan heart. I'm a self proclaimed total movie snob not easily pleased by much of what I see, but La La Land gave me all the feels and more. I cannot recommend this film enough. It's the kind of film you leave and you don't want the buzz, the tickle, the movie-high to end. I can't wait to see it again when it's in wide release. The artist in me is inspired again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Blah blah BLAND,"La La Land is summed up in it's title, and is a direct reflection of celebrity obsessed America. It will rate highly with those who don't have a real job, are highly over-paid or the anti-deplorables (elitist gentrified sanctimonious city folk). It is bland, directionless scripted dribble with good actors playing bad parts, and acting badly.Hollywood has lost its way, repeats of old ideas, a plethora of movies without real plots, without good scripts, having any real meaning or with mediocre TV learned method acting talent. Not all films have to be great films, everyone likes escapism at times, and we don't expect a Citizen Kane, a Godfather, or Blade runner all the time, however, what is criminal, is if we treat this film above its real status, which, unfortunately, appears to be the case based on its IMDb rating.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Greatly Overrated,"I went to see this film, feeling I had to after the rave critic reviews, the 14 Oscar nominations and the high IMDb score. I am not a great fan of musicals but remember Grease etc for some great dancing and singing. I went with my wife and 3 friends. Usually our perceptions and views on a film are quite varied! In the case La La Land we were all in agreement that the film had nice scenery and photography and good acting from the two leads but overall was a very ordinary film of a sentimental love story. The backdrop is the taken for granted opulence of the California wealthy where even an actress searching for work drives a new Toyota Prius (probably hybrid) and the lead male character, apparently short of money, gets a suit made to measure and somehow buys (?) a bar/nightclub. In conclusion the film is over- hyped, overrated average romantic tosh. Don't waste your money on this but instead go see a much better film such as Manchester by the Sea. This is my first written review which I felt compelled to give as IMDb's average score and critics have got it so wrong.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
What a let-down!,"In a word: turgid. Given the hype, I had expected an up-beat colourful, all-singing & dancing romp. Boy, was I disappointed! Save your money and take your loved one for a couple of beers instead.The opening traffic jam song-dance sequence was a nigh-on unintelligible uninspiring mess that added pointless minutes to what turned out in any case to be an over-long film. From there on we limp though a lacklustre passionless ""romance"" until we reach an ambiguous ending.There are a couple of cute songs along the way. The dancing is disappointing, especially if you're thinking of something along the lines of Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers.Ironically the high spot for me was the sequence where Ryan Gosling's character is playing keyboards in a pop band, something that conflicts with his jazz-based musical values.Gosling's character seemed mildly depressed throughout. which is not appealing. And although Stone can act convincingly, there's a limit to how much big eyed gazing I can take.When good films end, an audience will be buzzing with conversation, with smiles on faces. This one ended with silent shuffling. There was a palpable sense of disappointment. Did wives feel guilty for dragging their husbands to such a turkey? And did husbands fume at losing 2 hours of their lives, which could have been spent watching ""Homes under the hammer"" on TV?",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"""It's very nostalgic – will people like it?""","A little film. Not sure whether you might have heard of it yet? Damien Chazelle has followed up his astonishingly proficient ""Whiplash"" – my top film of 2015 – with a sure-fire theatre-filler in ""La La Land"". The old- fashioned musical extravaganza is back, and back with style!""La La Land"" tells the bittersweet love story of Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) who first meet in an LA traffic jam but then get thrown together by chance (LA is such a small place after all!). Over the course of the next four seasons romance blossoms.Mia is a struggling actress bouncing from audition to audition in a hopeless attempt to break through in LA's tough movie business. She makes ends meet as a Barista on the Warner Brother's lot. Meanwhile Sebastian is on a mission of his own: a talented musician, he is trying to restore jazz to the main stage (something the film's soundtrack will undoubtedly help do!) by opening his own classic jazz bar. As both strive for success on their own terms can love survive to deliver us the classic 'Hollywood ending'?The film is technically astonishing, with clever continuous shots of the ""Birdman"" variety and masterly cinematography (by Linus Sandgren of ""Joy"" and ""American Hustle""). The lighting team in particular is superb: a case in point is Mia's 'in-Seine' (sic) song, with breathtaking fades of the background to darkness, a camera whizz-around the actress for effect and then a brilliant fade back to reality. Loved it. Overall, there are enough similar moments in the film to make cinema-lovers like me gasp with delight.There's a curious timelessness about the piece which is surely deliberate. Whilst there are obvious and non-apologetic throwbacks to the classic musicals of the 50's like ""West Side Story"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"" and references to ""Casablanca"" and ""Rebel without a Cause"", there is also a 60's vibe to the 'girls getting ready' sequence; an 80's A-ha cover thrown in at a pool party; and a Californian Prius obsession that is surely more 'noughties' than current. Most curiously, while everyone has smartphones no one seems to text anyone to announce changes to plans: the film is almost distancing itself from much of modern life.In the acting stakes Emma Stone again shines like a beacon. She is just magnetic on the screen: (tiny spoiler) the biggest plot hole in the film is why on earth she wasn't given the part for her first audition! I was disappointed she didn't win the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for ""Birdman"" in the ""87th Awards"" (she lost out to Patricia Arquette for ""Boyhood""): but she just keeps getting better and Better and BETTER.Ryan Gosling's confident and cocky turn also radiates charisma: in particular, it is astonishing that Gosling could play ""only a few chords"" on the piano before training for the film. A confidence boost for struggling piano learners everywhere.It is actually difficult to imagine two better actors for the roles. (Emma Watson allegedly turned it down for ""Beauty and the Beast"": something she might be kicking herself for!) Are they both the best singers and dancers when compared to Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Debbie Reynolds (R.I.P.) or Cyd Charisse? No, undoubtedly not, but they have an undeniable charm all of their own. (Perhaps we will see the ilk of the great hoofers and crooners rise again with a resurgence in the classic musical. Can Hollywood take a hint?)The big question: now that both Stone and Gosling have won Golden Globes for acting in the ""Comedy or Musical"" category, can they convert that to Oscar glory where there is a single category in play? I'd like to think so.It's also great to see proper movie-making taking place in the Hollywood studios again: during my recent visits to LA there seemed to be little other than TV work going on in the main studio complexes there (although its worth pointing out that for this film not all of the filming was actually done on the Warner Brothers lot).Musicals are clearly measured by the quality of the music, and Justin Hurwitz (""Whiplash"") has produced a gem with – notwithstanding the jazz numbers and a catchy little pop number from John Legend – merely a handful of simple but unforgettable melodies that recur in different variations throughout the film. The soundtrack is already in my Amazon library and uplifting my mood on what is a damp and dreary Monday here in the UK.Damien Chazelle has delivered a triumph in both direction and original script. There is really very little I can fault the film on. In what was the somewhat patchy Coen brothers offering from last year – ""Hail Caesar"" – there was a standout moment of a throwback song and dance number with Channing Tatum that I raved about (you can find it on youtube). If I was being picky, then this tantalizing snippet would be a better representation of the style and vim of the original genre – – with the exception of the opening number, few of the song and dance numbers in ""La La Land"" quite get to that ""Broadway Melody"" level of scale and energy. This, together with a few concerns about the pacing in some places, led me to rate this as a 4.5 on first viewing.However on now seeing it twice within 36 hours, it's got me well and truly under its spell! I normally emotionally resist films that arrive with excessive hype but, in this case I give in. 10/10.(For the graphical version of this review, visit bob-the-movie-man.com).",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Obviously Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are so well played together, because they did two other movies together before this one. The music is obviously amazing, I just got new earbuds so it was even better haha.

Overrated. Sub-par music. Depressing Ending.,"This movie won awards and praised by some, so the chances are that you are going to see it eventually...As a musical it lacks good music and good choreography. It draws inspiration by classics like Singing in the rain and West Side Story but it can't compete with any of these masterpieces and it doesn't offer anything new in the genre.In terms of acting Emma Stone is very good, showing seamless transitions between opposite emotions but nothing special from Ryan Gosling who adds to the sad tone that the movie will eventually reach.The plot it starts as a satire of todays (and past and maybe future) Los Angeles, which is full of waitresses who want to be famous actresses and struggling musicians who have their own dreams to make it in a very competitive world.Later it becomes a romantic story (not only for relationships but also for dreams and wishes) but in its final act the movie takes a serious dramatic turn where the two ""happy"" endings are combining to a depressing conclusion, that even the final two reassuring nods can't repair. Add to this an alternate timeline flashback that the director/writer wanted to incorporate to his vision, and you end up with an overall depressing movie that actually ruins the optimistic feeling and the romance that initially had.Overall: Depressing. Mediocre forgettable music. A classic story that ends up in a melancholic, yet pragmatical, way..",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Zings ain't what they used to be,"After rave reviews and the Golden Globes there's now an Oscar/Bafta buzz attached to LA :LA LAND. Sorry to rain on the big parade but I was not blown away. Yes, there's some charm here with all the homage to the Golden Age of romantic musicals, and Ryan Gosling remains the most charismatic of today's young stars, but the music simply isn't musical enough. Gosling and Emma Stone can just about carry a song and do a bit of amateur hoofing, but really the singing is nearly as ragged as it was in the screen version of LES MISERABLES and the dancing is about as far from Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly as the first round of 'Dancing With the Stars'.OK, Kelly and Astaire (and Ginger Rogers and other co-stars of theirs) did not have great singing voices, but they were fantastic dancers and the song-and-dance numbers in their movies were never less than dazzling. The closest LA LA LAND comes to dazzling is in the final routine, a low-rent tribute to AN American IN Paris, but it just doesn't have enough dazzle. As musicals go, fings ain't what they used to be.The jazz club scenes hit the only high spots. Gosling really looks as if he's creating magic on the piano, but there's no magic in his singing or his dancing – nor in Stone's, who alas doesn't have her co-star's redeeming charisma. The love-story has a certain amount of charm but, like the music, it could do with a bit more 'zing'.The Golden Age nostalgia also extends to a clunky tribute to REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE. But nostalgia just isn't enough and there's too much clunkiness on display here. They say there isn't the money to create great musicals like we had in MGM's heyday. Surely it would take only a fraction of the budget for a CGI-heavy action movie or space opera to hire some first-rate dancers and singers who can act - or, if we must, actors who can sing (or mime to a better singer)? SINGIN' IN THE RAIN cannot have been a big-budget production, but it's still the greatest of the greats.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Criminally over-hyped,"To boot, I loved almost all the separate components of the film individually but I didn't love the resulting bundle.Aesthetically, my eyes were gently caressed with beauty for the full duration of the movie and for that I'm most appreciative.Ryan Gosling is his usual, immaculate self, succeeding in gracing us with yet another stunning performance -- stylish, suave and utterly charming.Emma Stone has her ups and middles but never a down, and she gave me one of the sole two scenes that made my breathing falter against an emotional hiccup; another win.Now, on the musical side of things...Meh.The songs left me disinterested, the overall sound dress of the film rang uninspired and repetitive, only resonating with my pathos during a couple of instances, while the rest lagged tiredly to the request of the more instinct-driven scenes.The story itself... a bit silly, no? Simplistic almost, benefiting from a strong start, a fantastic ending and the sparking chemistry between the protagonists, on the other hand, lacking any sort of actual substance past the forced demand to fall head over heels with the kitty- cuteness that we are being presented, no questions asked. I don't like having my arm twisted into feeling, and this is where this otherwise whimsical tale of sensory affluence hit another miss for me.To sum up. I acknowledge the individuality of the project, felt the strive and artistry that is so craftily weaved into the seams of this audiovisual extravaganza and I was, without a doubt, entertained. On the flip side, the way it all translated to my reason, the shortcomings of La La Land make this a middle-tier effort, only edging ahead on account of the fact that along with the glossy couple, I got to glide with effortless elegance through a Starry Night, brush shoulders with Monet, journey into the colourful and the capricious.For that fact, I will accept defeat, bump it up another star and humbly take off my fedora to it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Believe the hype,"What a great movie! Who would have thought anyone could bring the original screen musical back from the dead? Yet here it is, hale and hearty.The music is melodic but never simplistic; the lyrics are intelligent and intelligible; the script is funny, touching without ever resorting to sentimentality; the two leads are not only skillful but full of a kind of charm that I honestly thought had disappeared entirely from American movies: but here we have Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone just oozing it.The only pebbles in this ocean of inventiveness are some routine dance routines and over-reliance on the device of lights dimming on set to isolate an actor in white light, but that's me being r-e-a-l-l-y picky. It may well be that this is the best musical written directly for the screen since SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS.All credit to writer-director Damien Chazelle and his team - and it really feels like a team-movie - for giving us this gem. Sure it's a feelgood piece, but it creates a world which is complex, it acknowledges alternative outcomes for its characters, it connects with people's passions, and in the case of Ms Stone's big solo, ""Audition"", it has a bona fide classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"This ""hardly musical"" can't compare with the great song and dance films of the past","After watching this movie in early 2021 on DVD, I was puzzled by its very high IMDb rating. With more than half a million ratings, ""La La Land"" had an average of 8.0. I am a long-time fan of musicals of all varieties, so the high rating of this film seems strange. How could so many people think this film is equal to the best musicals of all time? Do they really think it is better than all but a few musicals? Musicals with a dozen or more songs? With hit tunes? With great compositions by famous composers? With singing by the best and most popular singers? With dance numbers and choreography by the greatest hoofers of all time?""La La Land"" has a total of six songs. The great musicals have 10 to 18 songs. Can anyone name a single hit tune from this movie? Can anyone even remember one of the songs? Did either of the leads record any of the songs -- Ryan Gosling or Emma Stone? Are either of them known for their singing or recording? Does either one have a hit record? Are there any known dancers in this film?I have seen way more than 200 musicals, and most of them were better than ""La La Land."" So, when I watched this film, it struck me that most of the people who rated it just hadn't seen many musicals. Surely none of the great ones of the past. And that would mean that they have little to compare with what little music, singing and dancing there is in this movie. So, perhaps it's a sign of the times. Perhaps there aren't such gifted musicians and singers and dancers that past decades had. Or, it might be an indication of how starved modern audiences are for quality entertainment.But there are a couple other possibilities for why this movie is rated so high. The first is the sentimental romance story. Modern people may be starved for good entertainment in the area of romance and love with the technology overload of the 21st century. And, then there is the ""sale"" of Los Angeles itself - including Hollywood and related sights. The publicity says from the start that this movie is a celebration of L. A. And, it shows a glamorized city, all clean and neat and without blemish. One wonders how many of the ratings for this movie came from the movie capital itself - from the 13 million people of the Los Angeles area, or the 24 million of southern California.It's not hard to imagine that a real propaganda film for the movie capital of the world, got high marks from its own area. And, that some others who thought it a smashing musical are among a population that doesn't know the great musicals of the past and/or that is starved for really great musical talent and entertainment. Adding all of that together is probably the basis for the high rating of this movie. I would wager that after separating out all the ratings of this movie that came from Southern California, the resulting average from the rest of the country - however large or small the number, would not be higher than 7.0, and would probably be closer to 6.5 or lower. There probably are a lot of 10 ratings from the Los Angeles environs, and many 7, 6 and lower ratings from the rest of the country.I'm not trashing the acting of Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone or any of the rest of the cast of this film. They were good to very good. But none of them are accomplished singers or dancers. While a couple of the choreographed larger dance scenes are good, they are more acrobatic with modern dance, than anything like the footwork of the great talents in films of the past. This film has nothing to compare to Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Gene Nelson, Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell or dozens more actors who also could sing and dance.With so many reviews already, I'm just weighing in to apprise younger audiences who enjoy musicals of all kinds, about some of the truly great musicals of the past. Here's a short list of films everyone should enjoy. For starters, there are three wonderful films from the 1930s - ""Top Hat"" of 1935, ""Show Boat"" of 1936, and ""The Wizard of Oz"" of 1939. The last one was in color. Color would take over after ""Broadway Melody of 1940"" and following the war years. The 1940s included top hits such as ""Blue Skies"" of 1946 with a dozen Irving Berlin tunes and Fred Astaire's debut of ""Puttin' on the Ritz,"" and ""Easter Parade"" of 1948 with Judy Garland and Astaire. The 1950s were dynamite years for great musicals - ""On Moonlight Bay"" of 1951, ""Singin' in the Rain"" of 1952 with Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds, ""The Glenn Miller Story"" of 1954, ""White Christmas"" of 1954 with Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye, and three of the greatest Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals - ""Oklahoma"" of 1955, ""The King and I"" of 1956, and ""South Pacific"" of 1958. The 1960s had such great musicals as ""Westside Story"" of 1961, ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Mary Poppins"" of 1964, ""The Sound of Music"" of 1965, and ""Hello Dolly"" of 1969.And, although the interest in musicals had waned by the 1960s, every decade has had several musical films made - some of them great films. The musical still has a considerable fan base, especially those with great music, dancing, choreography and plots. So, among later smashing musicals are ""Fiddler on the Roof"" 1971, ""Amadeus"" of 1984, ""Newsies"" of 1992, ""Immortal Beloved"" of 1994, ""Chicago"" of 2002, ""Phantom of the Operate"" of 2004, and ""Les Misérables"" of 2012.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

You'll be toe-tapping from start to finish,"You know when you're watching a film that you just don't want to end, and when it does end you feel as if you could watch it all over again right there and then? I had that feeling with La La Land, the new film from Damien Chazelle, who blew us all away with Whiplash a few years ago.With La La Land, Chazelle has made an irresistible musical comedy-drama that serves up a real delight for the eyes and ears. If you haven't heard of this film yet (where have you been?), I'm sure you will do in the coming months.Mia Dolan (Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress serving coffees to film stars while Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) is a jazz pianist playing a small time bar to make ends meet. The two meet and fall in love but it's their dreams of success that soon threaten to tear them apart.The most striking thing about La La Land is just how beautifully crafted a film it is; the story, performances, music, dance numbers and cinematography all playing their part in making this such an unforgettable cinematic experience. I genuinely can't find one single fault in this film.Chazelle proves yet again just how mature he is for such a young filmmaker, writing and directing such a touching and often funny love story with a meticulous energy. The whole feel of the film is a throwback to the golden age of musicals, a decision a lot of filmmakers would have been too scared to make yet the pay off is massively satisfying.The gorgeous cinematography from Linus Sandgren brings the city of Los Angeles to life, awash with colour, while his swift camera-work, including some impressive long takes, in particular through the dance numbers, immerses the audience right in the middle of this dreamlike musical.Coming to the performances, La La Land features two superb lead performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, both giving arguably their best performance to date. Gosling has really grown on me as an actor, maturing into one of the best in the business today. He proved earlier this year that he has a knack for comedy in The Nice Guys and he proves it yet again here. Stone always manages to impress me and she is dazzling in La La Land, singing and dancing her way into our hearts. The pair share an undeniable chemistry and I would love to see them both get the recognition they deserve come awards season.Justin Hurwitz's score and the original songs in La La Land, along with the wonderfully choreographed dance sequences, including a great opening number that sets the tone for the rest of the film, heighten the film's level of originality, maintaining that energy Chapelle's films possess.I dare you to try and not fall in love with La La Land.

A Love Letter to Hollywood,"La La Land (2016)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Struggling Jazz musician Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) meets struggling actress Mia (Emma Stone) and together they try to make their mark in Hollywood.LA LA LAND is a film that pretty much came out of nowhere and ended up grabbing fourteen Oscar-nominations. The film is a homage to Hollywood and everything that Hollywood used to produce. This, of course, is a musical so the film pays respect to the type of film that MGM and Hollywood was pumping out in the 1950s. Is the film worthy of all the praise it's getting? Calling a film overrated is something that will strike up an argument on any message board but while I don't think the film was that great, there's no question that it's an extremely charming film with two great performances.I will start off with what I didn't love about the film. One was the opening dance number, which was impressive in regards to how it was shot but at the same time I must admit that it really didn't pull me into the film. I'd also say that I didn't love any of the songs in the picture. A couple were nice but I really didn't walk out of the theater singing any of them. Finally, I did feel that the film went on a bit too long and would have benefited from about ten-minutes being cut out.With all of that out of the way, there was still a lot of stuff here that I really enjoyed but there's no question that the greatest thing were the two leads. Gosling and Stone were so great and so wonderfully charming together that you couldn't help but fall in love with their characters and want to see them succeed. I really thought both of them did a terrific job in their acting, their dancing and their singing and you can honestly say that they were among the most entertaining couples from recent memory. They really get to shine with the comedy, the romance and the drama and they really pack a great punch.I also really loved the Jazz music in the picture. The music is certainly something wonderful and it just perfectly builds up the story and delivers the goods. The film also benefits from some wonderful costume and production design with brilliant uses of colors that just leap off the screen. As I said, the film is a homage to Hollywood and there's some great dialogue about older movies, older stars and of course Jazz musicians.It's easy to see why people and especially Hollywood are in love with LA LA LAND. It's a great throwback to the type of romantic comedies and musicals that were made in a different era. I'm sure many young people were seeing this type of film for the first time. Hopefully some of those who loved this will go out and seek out the classics that this is paying homage to.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Very delicate aesthetics,"The direction was great and very clever in some scenes .The plot of the film quaintly managed to be realistic in a fairytale atmosphere .This movie made you feel pessimistic and optimistic simultaneously .The performances of the actors were at least admirable .Both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone seemed very talented , something that made me feel pleasantly surprised about Gosling .Though the bigger applause goes to the music of this film .

Good but not that good.,"La La Land had a decent plot even if it's a story told several times before. Hollywood musicals are not my cup of tea cause I'm used to Hollywood movies which are not musicals. It kind of kills the flow of story for me.I don't know how to judge their dancing and singing. But their acting was great in my opinion.The best part is the cinematography. The visuals look like they're from a fairy tale. Great color palette.To wrap it up, La La Land is a good movie. The ending was great but the musical part kind of tries to kill it.It's definitely not worthy of all those 10 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

A Stylish but Fake Dance Romance,"La La Land dazzles with its vibrant visuals, catchy music, and energetic dance numbers, but beneath all the glitz and glamour, it feels more like a hollow spectacle than a genuine romance. While the film's central love story between the two leads is beautifully shot and expertly choreographed, the emotional depth often feels forced. The characters' motivations seem more tied to the narrative's whims than any true connection, leaving the romance feeling a bit contrived. The dazzling musical sequences may sweep you off your feet, but when the music fades, the lack of real emotional substance remains. It's a film that's more about the idea of love and the dream of success than the messy, imperfect reality of relationships. Visually stunning, yes-but ultimately, it's a fake dance romance, more about style than substance.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Managed to surpass  the high expectations I had!,"Just saw this at TIFF and had a fantastic time! Solid 8.5/10. Having seen and loved Whiplash , I was really looking forward to Damien Chazelle's next movie. The fact that it would be a musical with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone just made me super impatient to watch it. Oh I also love jazz so that just made it pretty much perfect. Expectations were sky high from this team and boy did they meet them...and then some.The trailer was beautiful, from its colours to the soundtrack to the fact that it didn't give away any of the story and it really was just the trailer since the movie and it's music totally blows you away. The themes it explores , though not new, are relatable for anybody and the way the story is told really makes an impact. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were really impressive with their dancing and singing. I've always loved how natural their acting is as well and this movie was no different. Thoroughly enjoyed both their performances.The lead characters may be struggling in certain fields but it is their dreams they are chasing at the end of the day...Something we all have done or are in the process of doing. This makes you quickly feel like you know these people and what they're going through. Throw in some comedy, love, drama and magical soundtracks as well as sequences and you have yourself a masterpiece. I really haven't seen anything like this in a very long time. Damien Chazelle has proved himself again and is definitely someone to lookout for for years to come!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
You should surely give it a try.,"One of my favourite movies and favourite musicals. First of all you should not compare it with classical musicals, they are great on there on place. La la land is a kind of modern musical which is still revolved around some of the old school techniques. It's a great movie. Greatly written, greatly acted and greatly executed. The musicals scores are the best part of it. Other than that the movie is unique. It's not the kind of movie you've already seen. Don't hear what the people have to say about it.

A wonderful experience and my favorite movie,"Nothing I have ever seen captures the wonder of love, music and hope quite like La La Land. At first glance, it seems like any other romcom with above average visuals, La La Land is more than just that. La La Land is a masterpiece that should be on everyone's radar.
The performances of Ryan Gosling and Emma Gosling are one for the books, and their chemistry together absorbs the audience, especially Stone, who won an Academy Award and Golden Globe for the role. Damien Chazelle masterfully directs a flawless combination of the Hollywood musical along with a beautiful romance. Winning the two well deserved commendations of Academy Award and Golden Globe, the film is visually spectacular. The music, composed by Justin Hurwitz, is my favorite score of all time, fitting the feeling of the scenes like a puzzle piece.
The ending sequence of this film is nearly perfect. Stylistically, its one of the most beautiful moments in cinema, and pushes the movie to the next level.
This movie will never get old for me. I thought it did everything perfectly and will be my favorite movie for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
La La (Ha Ha) we fooled you. Signed Hollywood.,"Don't get me wrong, I appreciate Damien Chazelle as a director, his Whiplash is a ""classic"", but not La La Land. In film school, and Damien, if you read this you should now, and I know you will read it, you sold a lot of yourself to the producers in this one. I know you had a pure heart and wanted to make an indie film and knew it wont go far. But... Hollywood inflated it like a pretentious balloon. This is a pure Hollywood ""automatic driver car"" film . It was stated that the dancing and singing was intentionally natural and nor professional because it will add to the authenticity of having normal people acting. Come on, wake up guys, a dancing musical and singing should portray a great example of professionalism because that was this GENRE is all about. You can't make a romantic/drama and just add some amateur dancing and quality production music and make it a musical....The music production in this film was great and that is it...dancing was mediocre...acting was average...the sets were copied from old musicals, even cameras...they were so blurry because they filmed on the original old cameras and lenses...I don't mind that but It does not work for me like that. An old 35mm camera in a modern coffee shop is so pertinent.. Damien, I love you, but you ate the blue pill by friend. I know you are a very talented director/ musician but please, distance yourself from Hollywood because they took your film as their own...like Chicago and Crash. Don't imitate the oldies..do something that raises a middle finger to the establishment. I like the music production, songs are great in this film, and that the ending has a nostalgic feel and it can have a powerful but the rest...when you make an overall statement..it's just like any Hollywood fake flower. Show us real stories like you did with Whiplash.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Decent Movie- More Fitting in BollyWood than Hollywood,"BollyWood is the nickname of the Indian film Industry, largely centered in Bombay (now called Mumbai). It produces a steady stream of pisi-kaka every year. So much so that it is in Guiness book of World Records in some category. Most of BollyWood films are in that sense musicals because it has a lit of music and dance, and they are absurd (the song and dance sequence) but cleverly done.With that out of the way, I think the reader can figure out why I chose the above heading. If you have seen the movie, not sure why are you reading it (although I read reviews after I seen a movie to just check out what other people think) and if you have not, I would suggest you do go watch it. I have been meaning to ever since it came out and been postponing it because I wanted to be sufficiently depressed so that if the movie sucked, which it kinda did on many levels, then my day could not get any worse. And it did not.It is a strange movie. Almost like Seinfeld. A TV show about nothing. Although there is the loose connection with one's dreams, how dreams are almost difficult to pursue, bla-blah-blah and of course ends with the hackneyed cliché where boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy and girl go separate ways and boy and girl meets 5 years later to think what could have been. Boring. So BollyWood.Emma Stone is not even pretty but she grows on you and looks cute in the middle. Gosling is in equal parts good looking, good actor and does a decent job. Neither his performance, nor Emma Stone's , or for that movie as a whole is nothing to write home about. So aptly (if I may use a symbolism) summarized in Emma Stone's (Mia's) phone call to her mother describing Sebastian, her new boyfriend ('he is not anyone yet'). There are hardly any other characters of any significance in the movie. The guy who plays Kevin, or Keith- besides perpetuating the cliché' 'White Boys Can't Jump' (You have to have Black People if you are talking Jazz), do not see what was his role in the movie. I hear he is some kind of a musician of some fame. My advice would be (not that he needs it, or cares) that do not give up your day job. Talk about 'Product placement'!Acting is ordinary, sets are great and THAT dance sequence (with the Canary Yellow Dress) which is plastered all over the promo material is really good. Besides that, not much. Why it is so much of a craze, I would not know. Why 14 nominations, who knows? I don't get to nominate. And frankly who cares besides the folks who made the movie? It does not deserve the 'hate' (did not even know it had hate till I stumbled along the boards), nor does it deserve 14 Oscar nomination or 7 Golden Globes (surpassing One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest- seriously?).My wife watched the movie with her girl-friends on release day and described it as 'Magical'. I knew then I better not rush to watch it. It is a 'chick-flick' but with a sub- text. The queen of unrequited love is the man. How BollyWood! A solid 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
A wonderful film that begs to be watched.,"An observatory, a boulevard, a bridge, a downtown trolley, all make up filming locations of the new film ""La La Land"". These locations are iconic, yet remain unnamed throughout the film. The sum of these locations create the city of Los Angeles. Any meaningful production is a sum of its cast members and in the case of ""La La Land"" there is no difference. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) come together to create a wonderful production, but a lesser known yet ever present cast member is the city itself. Throughout the epic musical sequences, the city in its whole is either visible or represented by its historic street lights. Some might argue that the city is a backdrop to the songs and dancing of Sebastian and Mia but the city itself takes center stage with the vibrancy of a leading man. It lends its beauty to be danced upon by Sebastian and Mia without relinquishing its hold as being the center of attention.Mia being a minor actress in Hollywood goes to casting calls where those auditioning look the same. This image of Hollywood conformity lends itself to the character of Sebastian who has to change his performance identity much in the same way Mia has done in order to fit in and make a living in the beast that is Hollywood. With this being said the performances of Mia and Sebastian are one of a kind, lending itself to a sort of fantasy adaptation of falling in love. The imagery of the film stops at nothing to convey the idea of love and the concept of a soulmate, while the business aspects of Hollywood coupled with the necessity of survival keeps the two characters at odds. The film represents a city, a city that often times is at odds with itself; a city that identifies talent based on familiarity rather than the unique and often overlooked aspects that create it. Ultimately ""La La Land"" is a story about conforming and not conforming and the gains that can be had in between. LA is marketed as the land of dreams, yet is often overlooked and stacked on a pile of dreams that will never come to fruition.The film explores the idea of ""what if"", and tackles the idea of a working Hollywood versus a Hollywood where the idea of art is paramount. ""La La Land"" focuses on the idea of money versus art, and shows that nobel aspects of creativity are often ignored to focus on the monetary aspects of the industry while leaving behind the very art that drove them in the first place. The movie is very much paced in the realm of Hollywood where the cadence of the film is action packed with all the fervor of a young person entering Hollywood for the first time, yet as Mia and Sebastian learn the inter-workings of Hollywood the film slows down to reflect the realities that are faced when having to juggle income and art.""La La Land"" reignites a fire that has been lost from a Hollywood that is so focused on relaunches and reboots. It's refreshing to see a totally unique film, especially one that grasps the nature of Hollywood and Los Angeles in such an unconventional way. The singing, the dancing and cinematography move in perfect concert to give the appearance of something larger than life. The long musical sequences often border on the surreal, taking the shape of a wonderful dream with dance numbers in the clouds and in the stars. Yet at times the pacing of the film seems to trail off to a point of being boring, this is quickly remedied, but remains an aspect that should be looked at in editing.Watching ""La La Land"" is like being awake during a wondrous dream, there is something unique and magical about the chemistry between Mia and Sebastian as well as the visuals of Los Angeles that surround them. As he sits at his piano, Sebastian sweetly and softly sings Mia a love song, a powerful couple of lines that represent love, art and life. ""City of Stars, are you shining just for me, City of Stars there so much that I can see, Who knows is this the start of something wonderful and new, Or one more dream that I cannot make true."" With ""La La Land"" a dream has come true, and made its way onto the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Most Emotional Movie,"I was enchanted by this film, musical films are not my favorite genre, but this film struck me immediately, I thought it was famous only for the presence of John Legend, instead it has a secondary role.
I think the storytelling is perfect, it keeps you attached to the screen for the duration of the film.
The songs and choreographies are simply gorgeous.
I think it's perfect from start to finish, starting with an incredible long take and ending making you cry.
The photograph has goose bumps colors.
The direction and editing perfect.
This is a film that you can watch over and over again, every time you you are surprised more and more, after 5 minutes of viewing it has become an instant cult for me, as soon as the 1st vision is over it has become my favorite film and every time vision is even more so.

"Don't believe the hype too much. Cliché and overrated/bland story. Some nice songs. ""The Artist 2016"" 500 Days of Summer is way better!!!!!","I just watched this a second time. ""Someone in the Crowd"" (very catchy and upbeat) and ""City of Stars"" (emotional) are clearly the highlight songs of this film. I love those songs.It made me cry the second time watching it, especially when Ryan starts playing ""City of Stars"" for Emma. That part is very touching.Sorry, there is no way this movie is a 9/10 (currently), it will definitely go down once the hype dies down. I was excited to see this, but I think it is being over-hyped too much. I think it's better if you go in with low expectations.I understand this movie is ""refreshing"" than the typical usual marvel comic super hero movies or animated movies always coming out in theaters, but it's being too over-hyped as if it's the best movie/musical ever. Is everyone not really focusing on the story and just rating on the visual? It's like people criticize Michael Bay films right away because most of his action movies have a cliché generic plot, even though visually, he knows how to show action; well, people seem to forgive the generic storyline of LA LA Land because of the visuals.This is no ""500 Days of Summer"", that was released in 2009, (now that's a feel good movie from start to finish that breaks some cliché, which is easily a way better film than this/and has a better message)I can't help it but compare this movie to 500 Days because the whole different SEASONS things, it takes place in LA, some musical scenes, about pursuing dreams/romance/what if it happened this way instead and that... BUT, 500 Days of Summer is just a way better solid movie. LA LA Land, underneath the surface, take away all the dancing and nice costumes, just actually feels less magical than 500 Days.This movie also reminds me of ""The Artist"", which I'm sure most people have forgotten by now - was a major overrated, over- hyped Oscar win, where it was clearly praised on the visual/technical level/homage, because there really wasn't an interesting plot and the story was just bland and generic. Honestly, who really cares about Oscar wins anymore - the people voting choices are always predictable (Will Smith did not force me to write this); like another dreadful boring overrated movie ""Spotlight"" won just because it was controversial subject.This is a musical, so they will randomly start singing like in Disney movies. But the musical parts weren't as memorable, catchy, or exciting as I imagined or was hoping for from all the hype. It doesn't sound like real music, but just actors just trying to sing lines in a musical way. I don't think it's on the same level as Moulin Rouge.It actually came off more comical whenever Ryan Gosling just randomly starts singing. Joseph Gordon-Levitt can sing, but I don't think Ryan Gosling has that singing level. Even though 500 Days of Summer isn't a musical, I enjoyed that film's musical parts, and is way more memorable and feel-good.Griffith Observatory was underwhelming. Also, it's such a waste to see these nice large production sets/extras, yet the camera just pans fast across becoming just a complete motion blur. Again, 500 Days of Summer made LA look beautiful than it really is and felt more memorable. (They made that Angels Knoll park iconic). I just don't remember any memorable moments except the opening freeway, which is impressive on a production level, but it wasn't as legendary classic level or worth the hype, as it just felt out of place just randomly happening in the beginning of the film. Clearly they just wanted to open the film with some sort of big bang, but it's the same as throwing in a Michael Bay action sequence when there's no substance to the story. I was more thinking during that scene, why are we watching these people dance suddenly?I don't feel the romance between Ryan and Emma at all; their chemistry is more like siblings. The director relied too much on Ryan/Emma's ""chemistry reputation"" from their previous films together. They're both very talented, but I didn't feel the romance at all. The part where they say ""I love you"" to each other was cringe worthy/hard to believe. In fact, for them to get together is extremely forced and cliché in this film. I get the cliché formula already where they act like they hate each other in the beginning, but suddenly fall in love, but this one is so rushed for them to get together.It seems like the story was a second afterthought and the dancing/sets were more of the priority.There's a very ironic line in the film where John Legend says about being stuck in the old (jazz) from the past being a traditionalist won't bring the wave for the future... yet this film still tries to be in the old days of Hollywood. The film was shot in cinemascope; I thought the projection, at the theater I saw this at, was really bad - the colors were so dull/faded - but apparently this was how it was shot.Just out of nowhere ""sell out"" John Legend comes to the rescue. And out of nowhere, out of all things on Emma's last audition, where we expect to hear her maybe share about her whole ""magical"" experience with Ryan (which may be cheesy), instead she brings up about her aunt!? (which is even cheesier!) Like where did that come from?!!In harsh reality, dreams may come true. The irony in dreams, dreams may not always come true.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Golden age of Hollywood cinema re-imagined for today,"Telluride by the Sea (Portsmouth, NH) led off its 2016 weekend film festival with La La Land, a captivating film that hearkens back to the golden age of Hollywood cinema yet remains firmly embedded in present-day Los Angeles life. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling bring a startling depth and nuanced feelings to what could easily have been another trite variation on the theme of falling in and out of love. The film impressed me on so many levels, for the quality of the direction and cinematography, the seamless transition between musical song-and-dance numbers with a powerful narrative, the inventive choreography, the authenticity that Stone and Gosling brought to their portrayal of their characters, and the amplification of the intensity of their romance enacted through their singing and dancing. This film is not-to-be-missed by anyone who loves the classic Ginger Rodgers-Fred Astaire movies and who longs for a modern re- invention of this genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Fun while it lasted,"While there was some fanciful (silly?) plotting, I enjoyed La La Land while I was watching it - probably to the level of a 9 or 10 rating. It was fun and funny and romantic and beautiful and magical. Emma and Ryan are talented and very appealing, whether separately or together. The fact that they are not especially gifted as singers and dancers didn't bother me at all; in fact, I found that to be charming. The musical numbers were engaging and satisfactory, if not particularly memorable. It would be unfair to compare this movie to classic movie musicals, because it's really a whole different animal.However, in reflecting on the movie afterwards, I felt a bit cheated, so I dropped my score a couple of notches, and decided I had to write a rare (for me) review. My experience was like fully relishing a whole tub of buttered popcorn and then coming to my senses afterward. My first clue that something was off was how I felt at the end of the movie - not thrilled, not heartbroken - just disappointed (and a bit confused). In reflecting on this feeling, I realized that it wasn't that the characters didn't have sufficient chemistry for me to feel something; rather, the script/plotting let them down.The basic story is about two cute kids exploring their dreams in LA who meet and fall in love. The audience's dream is that these two can make it as a couple (despite inevitable setbacks along the way). If a storyteller is going to dash that dream, he or she needs a darn good explanation. There isn't one here. The two kids (rather magically, and in relatively short order, from a real-world perspective) achieve their career goals, presumably at the cost of their romance. Are we really to believe that they had to choose one or the other - and that, if so, these two dreamers would choose career achievement over love? The two breakup scenes were both totally lacking in terms of convincing the audience that this pair might be ultimately incompatible or should not keep working on their relationship and enjoying one another.So, I was robbed of a satisfying resolution. I was leaning toward a 7 rating, but I think I've talked myself into a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Although I like Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling as actors, they really should not be casted for musicals. Neither of them can dance or sing properly no matter how much they tried, and I bet they did. I wonder if anyone here giving this movie a 8 or a 9 has watched Chicago or Moulin Rouge. Both had incredible Cinematography, plots AND had lead actors who could sing/dance the hell out of their movies. And now here come Ryan and Emma who are mediocre at best at this musical. I'm kind of disappointing at their casting as lead roles because I think that with different lead actors (two who can actually sing and dance) this movie would've been breathtaking. On another note, it was a charming film with beautiful cinematography and a pleasant vibe. I did not mind the blurs, as someone mentioned, or thought there were plot holes. I would recommend it to other but only to realise that Emma and Ryan should've not been cast.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
A realistic story (love the journey) of two people living in a world of La La.,"I was flipping through the channels a few years back and came across this movie about 2/3 in (had no idea what it was about...my favorite way to watch a movie). And, WOW, I was captivated by the two main characters...of course did not understand exactly what was happening. When I watched the whole movie I was even more impressed!!I love piano so I was already half in, however, some will be turned off by the ""musical"" aspects of the movie. Give it a chance, it is all part of the character depth and the La La feel to it. The ending was very interesting and felt real.I have so much to say, however, I'll keep my first review spoiler free. :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
What am I watching?,"I wouldn't say I tricked into seeing this but I had no idea before going that the film would be a nonsensical forgettable throwback style musical that was clearly written for the demographic mindset of 40+ year old single women with three wine coolers in them. It was clear that the story, supposedly about Jazz or Theater or something, was aimed at pasty White people who don't know the first thing about Jazz or Theater. Mix in a lot of forced chemistry-free smiling, brutally crafted ideas for singing and dancing, and a couple of out-of-place 'f' words to make it seem that this is supposed to also be a film for adults and you have a recipe for a bloated overrated piece of glittery junk that looks more like a thrift store basket filled with cheap deceased people's jewelry than the most amazing film in decades. I kept waiting for Mary Poppins style cartoon birds or penguins to show up. Get over yourself if think this was any better than the awful 'Chicago', which by the way was just as forgettable although it stupidly won an Oscar and beat out several much better films. The dumbest film I have seen in years. Thanks for the nap.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
La La Land didn't live up to my expectations.,"The main 2 characters were well developed, but I felt the film lacked in depth and the story was very generic. This felt like just another milked Hollywood film with a lack of a plot. The film did some things right – The main actors were great and their relationship felt pretty real. Overall, this film was mediocre. It did some things right, but a lot of things wrong. My score for La La Land is: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
best movie oat,"La La Land is the best movie known to man. The acting is incredible and you can tell Gosling and Stone have ice cold chemistry (cold emoji). The music is very good and avoids the cringe you get with a lot of musicals, rather it incorporates the music into the movie very well. The cinematography is top tier, only beaten for me by The Revenant. The colour theory highlights the emotions of the characters subtly so it's not in your face and is still beautiful. It conveys an incredible message, that we need to surround ourself with the right people to grow as people, but it's important to be able to go separate ways and let go when your paths diverge. The best thing about the movie, however, is the ending. It gives me goosebumps to think about, and combines the best parts about the movie all into one perfect ending. Even if you don't like musicals (which I don't) this is the best movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Movie magic,"When I watched and reviewed this film for the first time about three years ago, I spent most of the review talking about movie magic. I did it because I believed this movie to be one of the finest examples of that. Now three years later, that belief has only grown stronger.For some reason, I had almost completely forgotten how happy La La Land made me. Otherwise, I wouldn't have waited three years to watch it again. Indeed now that I had decided to see it once more, I was incredibly excited to watch it. Probably the most excited I have ever been to watch a movie at home. But I was also scared. You see, this is one of the movies that I hold closest to my heart, and quite frankly, I was scared that I wouldn't like it as much as I did on the first time. What if it didn't feel special anymore? So in my state of excitement and fright, I started the movie and as soon as the first scene started I completely forgot about that fright and just started smiling. That's why I love this movie so much. That's why it's one of my all-time favourites. Because it just makes me so damn happy.La La Land is either my favourite or second favourite movie of all time (I need to rewatch Whiplash to confirm which one it is). One of the reasons why I love this movie so terribly much is because it's one of the only movies that I have seen that can just make me forget about everything else for over two hours. I love the music and the dancing. I love the way this film is shot and its gorgeous lighting. And above all else, I love the story and how it makes me feel. Perhaps it is that unexplainable movie magic that makes this movie as good as it is.I really need to make sure that I watch this film more often in the future. To me, La La Land really is just a festival of joy. It's filled with feeling and wonder, and it takes me to some other, much happier place.
To end with my favourite quote from the movie.

Very great,"The most magical part is without ever watching it three or fourth times, my mind is already stumbled with all the lyrics and lines. According to a reviewer (though I didn't know if it's original, I think it applies to everyone,) after years, when you if the songs again, you might not remember the lines, but you could always hynm it along. Most importantly, because of someone, the movie eventually has meanings to me too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
I tried to watch it I could not finish it.,"I tried to watch it but honestly I could not. I felt pain. I loved Marry Poppins. I loved The Sound of Music. Yet I struggled to watch this one and I failed. I simply could not finish it. I do not understand why it is acclaimed and why it got the golden globe. Of course I have to write 10 lines of text, and I will try just to be able to express my disappointment with this movie. I do believe that there is something really wrong with these movies, it brings back a memory from an Oscar two years ago (I think) when another weird movie got the best movie. It was The Bird man. No one liked, no one spoke about it, no one even remembers it. It appears to me that the academy jury like to vote for movies about themselves movies about actors and acting. That a closed circle, without connection to the rest of the world.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Better than just a musical,Was expecting another boring musical but it turns out that La La Land was a good romantic drama/ comedy. This film had great acting and cinematography. How it mixed a 50's ambiance with modern day was brilliant. It also does not follow ALL the standard romantic clichés that movies normally do.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Not Bad but no Milestone,"I like musicals but I must say I am a little disappointed by this one. Sometimes it is easier to make your verdict if you compare two movies of the same genre to get your opinion straight - Baz Luhrmans Moulin Rouge is imo in every aspect superior to La La Land: the story more drama, the music, singing and dancing superior, also the settings and visuals - superior. Imo first of all the story of La La Land is - mediocre and so are the characters. The story of La La Land is more of a soap opera than drama and so it lacks of depth, and for a comedy, well I miss the elements of comedy mostly. I like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone a lot as actors but compared to the performances and chemistry of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman they just look mediocre - I mean Kidman dying in the arms of McGregor is more worth than all of La La Land.Also if I compare La La Land with Sweeney Todd it loses - the story, the characters of the latter are just far more interesting, I didn't liked the music of Sweeney Todd a lot but at least the story was interesting and captivating enough to hold my attention. In La La Land I wasn't emotionally invested into the characters and in the music at all. Ofc I am no lover of Jazz but I remember that the movie Whiplash about the drumming kid got me invested and I liked the passion and stuff conveyed by the maestro teaching his classes and the young talented guy. I also liked the tunes. Also another recent musical Les Misérables with Jackman, Crowe and Hathaway beats La La Land easy. Okay I know, Les Misérables is a classic but the execution is just superb. Imho La La Land plays in the league of Into The Woods (Kendrick, Streep & Chris Pine), latter got its problems with the story but imo the tunes and singing performances are still a notch better.So all in all I would say for a musical, the music, the dancing, the story is okayish, the acting good, but La La Land I would only recommend for lovers of the genre who must see them all. If someone would ask me what musical he or she should watch for an introduction to the musical genre La La Land would not be on my list, or well, far from the top. Tbh - if this is Oscar material it just shows imo that the quality of recent Hollywood outputs don't belong to the best. Ryan and Emma both already have done much better movies before.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Colorful dreams,"The title ""La La Land"" is wonderful. This word is a common word in English. Webster's dictionary define ""La La Land"" as the following: ""an euphoric dreamlike mental state detached from the harsher realities of life"", that is, a blissful mental state that is general in dreams and free from cruel reality. In my opinion, this seemingly cute and unintentional word describes the story in the film very accurately and concisely, and also summarizes a message that the film wants to convey to the audience. In addition, La La Land is also an alias for LA Los Angeles where the story of the film is located. Los Angeles, the city of stars, countless young people come to Hollywood to find their dreams, and the dreams of countless people are shattered here. However, there are always people looking for dreams, and some people are young. The starlight in this city will never be dim, and it seems that it will always be so beautiful.This dream country is the lovely night under the purple and blue clouds, the pier that ca n't be seen at dusk, the bright galaxy with stars, and the dreamland that you sing and dance freely when you are happy. , neverland.

Quite possibly the best film I have ever seen!,"I've seen a lot of films. Over 1,000 from all generations and all genres. I saw every great film to come out this year.

It's stylish, and cool, and mind-numbingly beautiful! This is the film that you must see this year! It will make you laugh, cry, make your brain tingly. And it just doesn't end.

Over Rated or Over Hyped?,"La La Land sent the cinematic world into a frenzy, and I can't quite say I understand the hype. A musical in 2017 is bound to send people into a frenzy of excitement, anticipation and nostalgia. However, I think it was a bit over done. The beautiful dance scene after the party was a scene well though out enough to get all of our 1950s musical senses tingling, however didn't the iPhone ring just ruin it? I can see what the filmmakers are trying to do here, but isn't it a bit overbearing and too ironic? Irony is best served subtly. Although, the songs were captivating and both actors delivered beautiful performances and I won't forget about it any time soon.

The Artists,"Damien Chazelle whose father is French has made a Gallic tinged song and dance musical set in Los Angeles. In some ways it is a modern variant of Singin in the Rain but without the overt optimism which modern life does not have. The film has wowed the critics at the awards season but I think like the film 'The Artist' it might not stand up to scrutiny a few years later.This is a bittersweet love story between Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a jazz pianist passionate about the golden age of jazz and wanting to open his own club to play the type of jazz he wants before it really does go to obscurity. He keeps on bumping into Mia (Emma Stone) an aspiring actress who works in a coffee shop on the Warner Bros studio lot and goes to endless auditions looking for that big break but only to find disinterested casting agents.Both of them are looking for that big break but find each other slowly at first, but love may not be enough when these people also crave success. Sebastian finds it first, recording and touring with a successful group which puts their relationship under a strain.Director Damien Chazelle dazzles with a big opening musical number in a traffic jam on the highway but the energy of that number cannot be sustained. Like many modern musicals these days the songs are anaemic and unmemorable not helped with some of the jazz numbers. The film is right, much of the audience will be put off by the jazz music.The dance numbers between the pair is meant to be easy going than emulate Fred n Ginger and in some ways it works. Chazelle as in in his previous film Whiplash has found a rhythm to his film. It has a sentiment that individual pursuit for your dreams may be the price worth paying for true love. The story although at times tender as well as abrasive is not strong enough and the film really did feel stretched.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Highly over rated,"A struggling actress and a struggling talented musician are the backdrop to this musical.I am Indian so I love musical movies and was so surprised seeing Singin in the Rain, it was so beautiful. So I came in with a little too much expectation.I felt that the movie had too many songs! It detracted from the story rather than adding to it.Somehow Emma Stone was just not right for this part. Debbie Reynolds and Merylin Monroe are the kind of actresses that are just perfect for this role. A beautiful endearing smile and somehow you are rooting for them from the bottom of your heart. Relatively Emma Stone seems cold, though she seems to be acting very well.Ryan Gosling plays his usual cool dude performance and he does a fantastic job. But I would have loved to see Leonardo De Caprio in this role, it would have been stunning.They both have an interesting love story with the current trend of self deprecating jokes, situation analysis etc., (which I am not a big fan of). There are so many subtle things that I enjoyed, like the car, the studio, the music (things that you normally don't notice much when the drama takes center stage). And the ending left me a little disappointed. This is supposed to be an artistic movie, so it was not supposed to have a typical Hollywood ending, still not happy.Finally, a 'Hollywood' musical is a special, once in a blue moon thing and this just did not live up.

A Modern Day Musical,"There are many musicals that fall into my ""Favorites"" category and this is definitely one of them. For a Director to take two actors that have no singing or dancing experience, however a dynamic chemistry with each other, made it work.

Not sure what all of the hype is about....?,"I ventured to my local cinema to see this movie on the basis of a number of excellent reviews by critics and patrons on here. I will admit that a musical is not my normal preference for a movie, but as I love both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling and with these reviews in mind, how could I not go and see it? The opening sequence was quite impressive, and I also knew from the start that the cinematography was going to be to my liking old style Cinemascope, with great coloring. Unfortunately that's about where it stopped. The ongoing story line was very weak, and the music was even weaker - its not that Gosling and Stone performed awfully, but Moana has better song list than this. The movie limped along through its two hours, becoming more and more predictable as it progressed.....very disappointing.I have to really question how this movie could have been nominated for 11 Golden Globes (and actually won 7), when there are movies such as Hell or High Water and Arrival and Nocturnal Animals out there - all of which were considerably ahead of this. My only assumption is that, like The Artist a few years ago, this is a result of a wrist kissing exercise by Tinsel Town - aiming once again to congratulate themselves on how wonderful they think they are. Seriously peeps, whilst its not absolutely awful, its also nothing special, and certainly not as special as this critics are making it out to be. to be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, singing and dancing!","The dinner is served, girls and boys! Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are here to dazzle you with this movie musical serving as ode to both 1950's musicals and screenwriter-director Damien Chazelle's love for jazz.The story is generic but cosy as your favorite pillow: jazz pianist boy meets waitress / aspiring actress girl and they fall in love. And then a whole bunch of people dance and sing.The two lovely stars are both singing and dancing themselves, doing a good job at that. Still, personally I'd have chosen an actress with stronger on screen presence to pair up with already-legendary Gosling. But you know, whatever.I am not actually into musicals, so for me, by far the most impressive thing about this feel-good crowdpleaser is the boss man behind the screen: Damien Chazelle.The dude is only nearly 32 years old but he has done three movies already, always as a director and a sole screenwriter. You know him better as the author of 2014's majestic surprise hit ""Whiplash"".So... go see it. If you like musicals, you will be pleased. If you don't care about them, there's still enough feel-good stuff to enjoy the ride for 128 minutes.If you are a fan of ""Whiplash"" dying to get another dose of Chazelle, then be prepared for a nice surprise in the form of certain bald guy who should have a bigger role here for sure.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Another Titanic,"Another lost love story. People that know me, will confirm that I maybe don't know to cry, but this movie really touched me, if I knew how to cry, this was my moment!! She didn't say hi!?!?! WTF?!?!?Is definitely a sad movie, and probably his purpose is to remind us, the humans, how stupidly we choose money and a job over love, the feeling that many pretend is the focus of their life. It is sad to forget what is really important and lose someone over a job choice. I find it painful to have the ""what if"" in your shoulders, but again we all have a different understanding of what happiness means. The first part of the movie is quite slow, so be ready to give it a chance, it is worth it! Is not much auction there, but again you know you're going to a romance.I loved the fact that the story started and ended in winter, like the two main characters probably where feeling. He, hitting the rock bottom, trying to find a way to make some money without giving up on his dream, and she is training to keep her smile up while at every single audition is rejected and ignored. The beginning remind me of Bewitched, they keep running into each other like they were supposed to be together. The moment the movie starts you will think they hate each other so much they have to be together! Is like they are made for each other which by the half of the movie the story line proves you were right they do belong togetherLa La Land is a triumph on so many levels, and hopefully a lesson for many single people to think twice before they decide their life.

Pretentious nonsense,"I'll call it right now. 'La La Land' will win Best Picture at the Academy Awards, and for no other reason than the fact that the Academy loves a film about the industry. If there's a film based around movies in anyway amongst the nominees list, put your money on it to win. Does it deserve the award? No, there were many superior films released in 2016.Hollywood seems to be obsessed with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as a couple. This is their third film appearance together and for my liking they just get worse every time. Comparing the chemistry for example to Gosling and Rachel McAdams in 'The Notebook', they are worlds apart. Stone is a very good actress as far as emotional range goes, but she can't pull off the likable tag very well.I really enjoyed Damien Chazelle's previous film 'Whiplash'. In a lot of ways they are very similar films, but in the more important ways they are worlds apart. The biggest difference is the modesty that 'Whiplash' achieved. It had great characters, yet it acted like it didn't know it. 'La La Land' has very average, even poor occasionally, characters yet acts like they're God's gift to cinema.I was really disappointed coming out of 'La La Land'. Even though I knew it wasn't my type of film ideally, I was willing to give it a chance and thought it might surprise me due to my low expectations. On the contrary though, it managed to fall below my expectations. My advice would be don't be fooled by the reviews and probable Oscar nominations.

Charming BUT,"I can only give LaLa Land a 6. With all the hype I really thought I would be more entertained. The story has been told so many times. The dance scenes are fun - not quite old Hollywood but close. The special affects were fun - like the dancing in the stars - actually quite beautiful even though you can tell how they did it. Very little dialogue -and that was OK but it was missing something to me - cannot quite put my finger on it. The colorful costumes were fun, the music was good but I do not think I will be humming any song tomorrow. John Legend was good - and he did write some good songs for the movie. So to me, it was an interesting movie and if the Oscars had a musical best movie award - it would probably get it since there is little competition. I do not see it as a best movie for 2016. I do not think I will be thinking of this film in the next week and to me, when I am still thinking of it later then it has stirred something in me to make it memorable.

Rating: A+,"At the very beginning of every year, I write a list of all of the movies that I've been anticipating for a long time (mostly based on comic-books) and those that either have a good premise, a good director and/or a good cast. La La Land didn't have a release date in January (I think), but even if they had, I'd have probably left it out (maybe I did). I don't have a least favorite genre, I enjoy watching every type of movie, but musicals are by far the ones that I find to be less interesting or even well-made so, even with a great director and cast, I only got the urge to watch this film because of all of the Oscar talk and the beautiful soundtrack that I've been listening to in the last couple of days ...Perfect. Magic. Absolutely stunning. I don't have words to describe how AMAZING Chazelle's direction is. I mean, anyone can enjoy this film because it IS great entertainment, but the amount of work that they had with this MASTERPIECE is unbelievable. Extremely LOOOOONG takes, over and over again, with excellent synchronized choreography and an original score to remember forever and ever. Every single shot drops such marvelous quality that I kept being surprised every single scene. This is the best directing skills that I've seen from a director since God knows when. Congratulations, Damien Chazelle. You won yourself an Oscar, a Golden Globe and every other award that honors the man behind everything.Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are incredible and I can't imagine any other actors portraying their roles. Gosling is the usual funny, charming and loving guy, while Emma Stone definitely has her career- best performance (even better than on Birdman), worthy of many awards. The way they interpret the songs is so captivating and emotional that they just make the music even greater (watching besides listening gives it such a more compelling meaning). The score is so beautiful and heartfelt that it's impossible to explain through words the feelings one has as listening to them ... Just fantastic.My only concern with the movie was the romance and the overall story, I thought it would be super cliché and follow the usual paths that this type of films have ... Nop. Even the story is great. I mean, I don't want to spoil anything, but let me just say that cliché is not a word that I'll use to describe this movie. It doesn't follow anything, it has its own original story and the romance is super smooth as the actors' terrific performances. It FEELS real.I never thought I'd say this, ever, but ... La La Land is (probably) the best film of 2016 and my favorite, for sure. One of the best direction I've ever seen from anyone (please, Damien Chazelle keep going!), an absolutely pitch-perfect duo (Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have a perfect chemistry), a fantastic non-cliché original story about pursuing dreams and the most beautiful and heartfelt soundtrack that I'll listen over and over again for God knows how long ... Magical. Rememberable. I can't wait to watch it again!!!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
My Favorite Movie From The Recent Years,"As someone who loves classic musicals like Singin' in the Rain, West Side Story, Sound of Music, On the Town, and others, I had low expectations for this film. A film trying to replicate the joy and wonder that the old musicals brought to so many sounded absurd and would probably fail in its attempt.I WAS WRONG!!
I loved this film! It was a wonderfully fun and has phenomenal score to back the energetic dancing. The production design can not be overstated with the over-saturation of colors to reflect the once brilliant L.A and when there is a conflict between the characters, the colors become more pastel and faded. The cinematography was amazing, with a very fluid camera during dance sequences, defying the stereotypical wide, stationary shot that would include all the dancing and singing. Acting was great and included real emotion from Ryan Gosling that did not involve him eating cereal.TLDR: Takes all of the amazing aspects of the old musicals and Broadway and compliments them with surreal emotion and story-telling. Must see if you enjoy musical theatre or looking for a film to watch and have fun. 9.6/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Cinematically appealing,"From the internationally proclaimed musical director from Whiplash, damian chazelle has come back strong with another musical film' LALA LAND.
storming 5 academy awards and 6 golden globes has proven how successful the movie is, besides, it gains it.
The movie starts with the song 'Another day of sun', with a group of people dancing in highway, the choreography itself is remarkable enough, but the real magic lies in the tracking shot throughout the whole song, without any editing. The cinematography by Linus Sandgren has not only stops at the tracking shot, but the use of natural lighting throughout the whole movie. The colour grading and the camera movement has created a tremendous nerves of visual sensation. Each songs blends into the music perfectly, with the camera following the choreography, showing each dancing movement clearly. 
This doesn't stop the cinematic magic of Damien Chazzele. He himself is a musician, he knows the music well enough that he understand how music may engage the audience deep enough to make an impact. He finds Pasek and Paul to be the composer of the music soundtrack, the soundtrack won the academy award forest original soundtrack. After watching the movie, the songs and lyrics keeps popping out in my head, brainwashing, this is how the cinematic magic works. 
Words can't describe how appealing the movie is. Some may say the plot is too realistic and the whole movie is overrated, but these opinions comes to be objective. Maybe the plot may not suites anyone's taste, but you can't deny the fact that this movie somehow brings a impact to people, letting people feeling nostalgic back to the 60s, where it claimed to be 'the golden age of Hollywood', after adapting ideas from 'Singing in the rain', 'the umbrellas of Cherbourg' and 'revel without a cause'. The usage of costume and colour somehow comprehend a special visual experience, making the movie colourful and strong in sense.
The special chemistry between Ryan gosling and Emma stone also reminds us of the reality nowadays, making us feeling someway desperate of the truth, where people are unable to follow their dreams, but to sacrifices lots in order to achieve our goal.
Emma stone has done a brilliant job of portraying the role of Mia, maybe she can't sing, but the acts and emotion of hers is undeniably relatable; While Ryan gosling, acting as the role of Sebastian, frankly, is a bit too ordinary. 
Damien chazzele may be the new generation of musical director, bringing new era of musical film to Hollywood. Back in the 50s and 60s, when musical film are a hit, the hype ends in the 70s. Nowadays, less and less musical films are made, in hope of Damien chazzele, wishing he may bring back the hype of musical film back to Hollywood.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
The Best Musical in Decades,Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling both sing and dance exceptionally. La La Land is a homage to the great musicals of the past and an ode to struggling dreamers everywhere.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"""Cute"", but ordinary","I'm not a fan of musicals. Obviously there are exceptions, such as ""Singing in the Rain"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", and, more recently, the great ""Sing Street"" (not the regular American musical, where people seem to feel an uncontrollable urge to sing and dance in the middle of the street for no reason at all). However, even going against all my instincts, and because of all the fuzz, I decided to watch ""La La Land"".I arrived; I sat down; I settled down; I waited. The movie begins. Suddenly, people singing, reproducing a choreography perfectly rehearsed, almost mechanical, an explosion of colors as if the world was painted in Technicolor in a long take (?) - practically perfect. I could no longer stay put, every position was already bothering me after 3 minutes.Then we have the first glimpses of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. A bad start. How shocking! At first, we are introduced to Mia (Stone), and later we become familiar with Seb (Gosling). In a third moment, we finally have the two together and, from there, inseparable (but not so much). And here, I must say, the fact that Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are extremely charismatic helped me a lot so I would not go into a catatonic mode and stop paying attention to the screening unfolding in front of me. But not even the enormous charisma of the two was enough to make me enjoy ""La La Land"".I like Emma Stone, she's a good actress. She does not have much depth, let's face it, but she manages to do her job in a decent way. I think ""Birdman"" was her less ""Emma Stone moment"" of all, because I could see a little beyond the wide eyes and the half-open mouth, her trademarks. Well, neither Emma nor Ryan are singers, much less dancers. However, it seems that all the reviews minimize these details, especially due to the forced exuberance the director displays throughout the film and the chemistry between the protagonists. The harsh reality is that Stone is no Debbie Reynolds, let alone Gosling a Gene Kelly. I could not minimize it. It was strange, it was uncomfortable.The whole experience was uncomfortable. Chazelle is a good director, who has impressive technical skills. But, for me, he tried to take a step way longer than his legs. Perhaps, he was overconfident because of what he achieved with ""Whiplash"". I don't know. All I know is that it lacked humbleness. ""La La Land"" is pretentious and, at the same time, ordinary, it hides behind the right light and a good art direction.Although the film is ""divided"" by seasons, it gets a little tricky to realize this when its set is Los Angeles. Apart from the captions on the screen indicating that we have passed from spring to summer and so on, nothing else alludes to what seems to be something important for the narrative: neither the set nor the cinematography. So, be it summer or fall, all that hovers is the love between Mia and Seb in gaudy colors.Not that the cinematography itself is bad. Quite the opposite. It's too beautiful. As I said, the lighting is right, almost perfect. Do you see the problem? When I watch a movie photographed by Lubezki, for example, I do not need to be constantly reminded by light tricks that he is a master of cinematography. But Linus Sandgren is not a Lubezki. It is not innovative, it is not exceptional.And this leads us to the script: girl meets boy; girl falls in love with boy; girl and boy live unforgettable moments; problems happen. I have to admit that, here, Chazelle even tried to skip the usual ""and lived happily ever after"". But it backfired. I'm not going to tell what happens at the end cause it would be unfair to those who have not yet watched it. It is enough to say that, even if he wanted to do something different, it was nothing that we had never seen before. As if it was not enough, he decided to teach us about dreams, expectations, determination and reality. Not necessary. Too unnecessary.I do not doubt that many people really liked ""La La Land"". It was made to be liked. I just do not understand how more experienced eyes have been fooled, giving a masterpiece status to such an ordinary movie. The directing is almost convincing; there are some interesting metaphors (Jazz + Hollywood + Golden Age) Even so, ""La La Land"" is miles behind the great musicals ever made; it's beneath its fuzz and beneath the expectations of someone who wanted, from the bottom of the heart, to have liked this film (myself).",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Poetic and Beautiful,"Poetic maybe is the best way to define this movie, it express this characteristic in every aspect, choreography, music, acting, story... It is, indeed, a piece of art and the movie responsible to mold my apreciation for Jazz, that is the music background of the whole movie. La La Land is beautiful and have a cliche, but powerful meaning: follow your dreams. This is, for shure, the main message of this movie, everything, since the beginning to the end, results in this message, and it's expressed in a beautiful, exciting and glamorous way. Different from a lot of musicals, this movie isn't, tacky, cliche or any other synonim that can come from this, the music is perfect, well placed and very, very well synchronized, acting as almost a protagonist in the story, and expressing the most beautiful and sad feeling of the narrative.La La Land is one of my favorite movies of all time, and i strongly recomend anyone to see, regardless of your personal tastes. It is, indeed, inspirational like few movies are.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Ryan Gosling is a great actor and playing jazz is amazing. However, ""La La Land"" is also overrated as a film nominated to the Oscar in the category ""Best Film"".

Extremely dull - what makes it deserving of awards??,"I struggled to keep awake during the movie - and that is not how a good film is supposed to be. La La Land was not atrocious but I'm giving it 1 star because it was the first film ever that made me regret spending time and money on. If it weren't for all the hype I might've given it 4.Was there a point in making this film? There is nothing special La La Land is trying to convey, the acting is bland, the songs are dull, the storyline is overused and predictable, all in all it is a film of clichés. I seriously cannot believe this won so many awards - should I be worried about the future of film or am I missing an important point?",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
A La La Land That Works,"Living in La La Land, that's exactly what director Damien Chazelle wants people to feel when watching this film and he really did accomplish that. A struggling actor, Mia (Emma Stone) and a passionate jazz musician Seb (Ryan Gosling) cross paths through a series of weird events that eventually bring them together. Throughout the film, I really felt like a part of the story and while the writer pulls you in with the compelling plot in the movie, many other elements including acting, the soundtrack and cinematography contribute to the overall wowing effect.
Right off the bat, the acting seems very realistic. Ryan Gosling often plays softer characters with little musical background, however when his character Seb gets fired from his job, the facial expressions he uses are striking and makes it seem like he really cares about Seb's passion for music. During this moment, the audience can really see the raw emotion of Chazelle's characters contributing to the wonderful acting and emotional grasp throughout much of the film. Again with Emma Stone, you can tell she really cares about her acting within this movie because she seems very emotionally connected to her character Mia. When Mia is auditioning for her final role for a movie in Paris, she begins to cry and have various flashbacks and fantasies. Again, I really liked the acting in this scene because it made the characters seem more real and connected me to the plot. Overall, the acting in this movie was great and really added to the likeness of the film for me.
Also, the soundtrack throughout this film continues to show this fantasy effect of a sort of La La Land as well as tie in elements of a theatrical production. Usually in musicals, the soundtrack can be very cheesy and contain almost all love songs. La La Land definitely has some of these and at times I laughed because it was very dramatic and unrealistic. But maybe these moments weren't supposed to be funny and laughable? Sometimes it seemed as if the soundtrack didn't add the right emotion to the movie as the director had hoped, however the songs are very catchy and provide an avenue for soliloquy. For example, after Ryan Gosling meets Emma Stone he walks onto a pier to what it looks like reflect on the moment but instead he sings ""City of Stars"" which although a sadder song, does not portray all of the emotions he is feeling at that time but instead adds to this theatrical style that Chazelle creates.
Lastly, the cinematography really emphasises the style of this movie. Without it, it would break the film to be honest. During many moments of emotion or theatrical expression, the director does a really great job of capturing it by zooming in to gain a more personal affect and zooming how to get the full picture. Also the colors they use in this film are amazing and make it seem as if you are apart of this floating setting the director creates. However, sometimes I thought the way they filmed it seemed childish because they were so focused on the color and show-like atmosphere that some of the deep character development is lost. Even though it could be taken as childish I really do think for the most part the cinematography added to the film.
In conclusion, La La Land surprised me because of how great it was and how connected I felt to it when I watched it. The acting, soundtrack and cinematography in this film very much made it an impactful one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Love or Hate musicals: Watch this film!,"As you may be able to tell by the other reviews on this website, everyone is split on whether this is a good film, or a bad film. Think of it as this, the film is described as a Comedy, Musical and Drama.This film is funny when it needs to be. I wouldn't call it an out and out comedy like a Kevin Hart or Will Ferrell film. Nor would I compare it to a Wes Anderson film where it's a witty black comedy. It's just funny when it needs to be.This film is a brilliant drama. The film begins and you may think ""Oh well this is generic"" but if you stay to the very end of this film you will find that Damien Chazelle has not only proved himself as a very good writer, but is a world class director. No other director can develop characters and make you care for them like Damien.This film is also a musical, surprise surprise. I don't know what people were expecting coming into a modern musical, but the Director chose Jazz. Not everyone likes Jazz, but personally I thoroughly enjoyed the music in this film, and this comes from someone who doesn't like musicals OR JAZZ.I won't ridicule you for not liking this film, but no matter what you think about Musicals, or Dramas, or the film itself. You MUST watch your film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
I didn't want to feel things,"First film ever that made me tear up like a baby. While probably being my favourite musical, the songs in this film weren't really what stuck out as exceptional to me. It's just beautifully shot, well acted with great dialogue, and it perfectly encapsulates emotions of sentiment.I must admit this film's hard to get into at first, but I quickly got past the cheesiness of musicals and was loving it from Ryan Gosling's introduction onward.I also love the way the messages are portrayed. The grim depiction of conflict between dreams and relationships. The way it communicates (with jazz) how art needs to evolve to survive, and how that's not necessarily a bad thing. This film itself is a modern reincarnation of 70s musicals, poetically playing into its own metaphor about helping old art-forms survive. Something about the characters just hit especially close to home though - watched it twice so far and still love it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Why make a musical with a lead actor who can't sing?,"I'm sorry but Gosling's singing was atrocious. Unfortunately, he wasn't the only person in this movie whose singing was not good enough for a musical production. Right from the opening scene you are confronted with actors who wouldn't make it past the first casting round of a Broadway show.Don't get me wrong....I like Emma Stone but she doesn't fit the role of ""young, aspiring actress"" anymore which makes her something of a miscast. The story is plain boring and the dialogue is bland. Who wants to see Gosling agonizing about the nature of Jazz music in long scenes drawn out like old chewing gum followed by semi-neurotic ""love interest scenes"" which seem to pass for convincing romance these days? I guess two people who qualify for couples' therapy sessions after just having met is the new normal.The cinematography is great and the director really knows how to ""paint"" moving pictures but it's all form and no substance making it the musical equivalent of a Michael Bay action movie. In my opinion this is one of the most over-hyped and overrated movies in many years.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Short of greatness,"Tis said that a really great picture is one where even the small character parts truly stand out. Gone With The Wind boasts not just its four memorable leads, but a whole flock of memorable characters who stand out. Dr. Meade by Harry Davenport and his wife Julia Meade by Jane Darwell are two examples and there are many more.La La Land stands short of real greatness in that it only concentrates on its two leads with the rest of the characters well into the background. But the two leads Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone being nominated for Best Actor and Actress and Stone taking home the Oscar gold.La La Land is a salute to those old time backstage musicals in an age when movies just don't have the talented musical performers to do those films any more. Emma Stone had some nice notes, but Gosling did his singing in the tradition of Rex Harrison who as I recall won Oscar and Tony for being Henry Higgins with talk/sing role.Gosling is a musician, a jazz pianist in the tradition of Earl Hines and Count Basie and he wants to bring back jazz. He truly hates contemporary music and the fact he has to play keyboard in a rock band rather than do what those aforementioned gentlemen did. I really identified with Gosling, in my own life I'm posting music with Bing and Frank and their contemporaries on Facebook and care not if no one else listens but me.Stone just wants the world to notice her talent and in that cruel and heartless world that can be show business getting noticed about 3/4 of the battle. She does do a reckless move that would and could dishearten anyone so the world will notice what she has to offer.Besides Stone winning Best Actress and young Damian Chazelle for Best Director, La La Land won 6 others and several more nominations like Gosling's. The music is fine though I wish we had people like Frank Sinatra or a Gene Kelly to perform this stuff now.La La Land is a wonderful film that falls a tad short on greatness.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Disappointing. What could it have been if Chazelle had given over the writing to someone else? One can only imagine.,"Disappointing. The story ending seemed like a compromise. I wasn't impressed by the flashback to what their life could have been like. It wasn't mimicking the ending of legendary musicals like Singing In The Rain, or films like A Star Is Born, about a couple whose stars are in opposing trajectories. So what was it trying to achieve? A muddled and unsatisfying finish was all I was left with. They both get what they want in their careers, but not each other? Hmmm... The music is weak overall (mumbly), and the dancing isn't remarkable apart from the opening number. It's beautiful to look at, and the production values keep the whole thing running to a point, but you can only admire the beauty that David Wasco, Austin Gorg and Sandy Reynolds-Wasco created (Production Design, Art Direction and Set Decoration) for so long.

"""La La Land"" is a wonderful and refreshing, but imperfect film.","In real life, most people don't randomly break out in song and dance, but the escapism of the big screen has been bringing Movie Fans musical feature films since the very first days of the sound motion picture. Only the second film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture was a musical (1929's ""The Broadway Melody""). Oversaturation in the marketplace and changing audience tastes led to the production of fewer musicals, but they never went away. Some of the best-loved musicals in film history (e.g. ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"") came out in the 10-year span 1944-1953. But the ensuing decades each produced very popular musicals: ""West Side Story"", ""The Sound of Music"" and ""Oliver!"" (all Best Picture Oscar winners from the 1960s), ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", ""Grease"" and ""All That Jazz"" (1970s), ""Victor/Victoria"", ""Little Shop of Horrors"" and ""The Little Mermaid"" (1980s), ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""The Lion King"" and ""Evita"" (1990s) and, in the early 2000s, ""Moulin Rouge!"", ""Frozen"", ""Dreamgirls"" and ""Chicago"", which became the first musical in 34 years to win Best Picture.2016's ""La La Land"" (PG-13, 2:08) is the purest original (non-adapted) live action musical in many years, and has both the pedigree and the quality to duplicate the accomplishment of 2002's ""Chicago"". ""La La Land"" was written and directed by Damien Chazelle, who was the writer-director of 2014's ""Whiplash"", which earned him Oscar nods for his script and his film. This one is filled with original songs which are composed and orchestrated by Chazelle's previous collaborator, Justin Hurwitz, with lyrics by the award-winning musical theater team known as Pasek and Paul. Musician John Legend has a major role in the film and its stars, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, are both past Oscar nominees who earlier appeared together in two other movies – 2011's ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" and 2013's ""Gangster Squad"". And, yes, they both sing and dance while telling this particular musical's story of romance, dreams and hope. It takes place in the present but feels like a throwback - like the most entertaining musicals of yesteryear.The film's title has a dual meaning: (1) referring to people who live their lives in a seemingly unrealistic dream world and (2) the city of Los Angeles itself, where most of the action takes place. In fact, the film opens with a song-and-dance number with commuters stuck on a typically grid-locked L.A. highway. At the very end of that scene, aspiring actress Mia Dolan (Stone) has a random, brief and unpleasant encounter with struggling jazz keyboardist, Sebastian Wilder (Gosling), who acts like a real pianist. The two run into each other again in Sebastian's jazz club, immediately after he's fired by the club owner (J.K. Simmons) for insisting on playing his own music. Sebastian is no more polite this time. The two finally ""meet cute"" and before long, Mia has left her roommates behind and moved in with Sebastian.Neither life nor love go smoothly for this pair of stubborn dreamers, but they sure do try hard at both. Mia continues working as a barista on the Warner Bros. studio lot and going to frustrating audition after frustrating audition. Eventually, she decides that her best way forward is to write, finance and produce a one-woman show which, fittingly, focuses on her experiences of leaving her hometown in Nevada and moving to La La Land to pursue her dreams. After dropping the humorously humiliating job where Mia sees him at their third encounter, Sebastian continues to hold fast to his dream of opening his own jazz club, but doesn't really do much about it. He reluctantly takes a job on keys in a music group run by an old acquaintance (Legend), but doesn't enjoy it because they don't play his style of pure jazz. Sebastian's unhappiness turns to resentment and ends up being directed toward Mia, just as her show is about to open. The eventual resolution of their love story and their individual pursuit of their dreams feels right for a movie which celebrates dreamers, but shows what happens when life doesn't go as we've planned.""La La Land"" is a wonderful movie, but not, as some reviewers would lead you to believe, flawless. After three contentious encounters, the two main characters just suddenly fall in love, a development that isn't very well earned by the script or the acting. Otherwise, the performances are excellent (especially Stone's) and the script is funny, poignant and grounded except for that whole thing about characters suddenly breaking into song. But when they do, those songs are both fun and touching. The dancing, however, seems to lack some of the energy and joy that you find in the older Hollywood musicals that inspired this film. Having said all that, I have to put these relatively minor criticisms into perspective: This is a very entertaining and affecting movie. You'll likely be emotionally invested in these characters, smile a lot – and leave the theater wanting the soundtrack. For someone who wants more variety and positivity in today's films, this one is a gift. ""A-""",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

A modern musical classic!,"Unusually for me, I actually had good expectations going in to this movie. I've always loved the classic musicals of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and to see such a film as La La Land hit theatres in this day and age felt like some sort of revival of the long dead musical genre. But the big question is, is there anything under the surface? Is it just a fun musical with great songs, or is there more than just that?Well, it's with deep pleasure that I can in fact say it isn't just a musical - if anything, it's a good story first, a great musical second.Yes, I went in expecting a good musical, and to be honest, if all it was was that, I would have no complaints. But this movie took it another level. It had an extra layer that I wasn't expecting.I enjoyed 2017's Beauty and the Beast remake a lot. It delivered, with great songs, and brilliant dance choreography, but let's be honest - if you take all that away, what would you have? It wouldn't be half the movie it was without the musical side of things.Take La La Land, and you have a movie that would work fine even if you took the musical side of things away. The songs only make it even greater than it would have already have been.The chemistry between the two leads feels genuine and believable. They don't feel like fictional characters. Instead, they feel like real human beings, with real aspirations and real dreams, hoping to prove their worth. As someone with big dreams of hitting it big, this undoubtedly hit to heart with me.I've heard some backlash from some, people who want to get over critical due to the movie's massive success. Some say it's nothing but an excuse for Hollywood to glorify themselves with much narcissism. Those people completely misunderstood the whole point of this movie. This is a raw portrayal of Hollywood, and the challenge one has to achieve success.The ending - I dare not spoil it! It is the very cherry on top of a delicious cake.I tell you, if you have not watched La La Land, believe the hype! It's as good as they say it is!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"A masterpiece in technical qualities, breaking new ground with its tragic story while simultaneously being a love letter to years past musicals","A masterpiece in editing, cinematography, sound design, composition, and production design La La Land is a timeless showcase from director Damien Chazelle at his best, breaking new ground with its tragic story while simultaneously being a love letter to years past musicals led by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling.The technical qualities of La La Land are superlative. Damien Chazelle expertly crafts the choreography with the editing and sound design. The song and dance numbers throughout the film, especially during the opening at the road interchange, are flawlessly directed. Employing long continuous shots do not distract from the singing and dance sequences. In terms of cinematography, shooting the movie on film rather than digital, and using the widescreen CinemaScope aspect ratio gives La La Land a classical look. Low-light photography in select scenes reflects each character's emotional state. The cinematography is contrasted by brightly lit scenes which further reflects the ambitious and high-minded themes of the movie. Every technical quality fits and transitions so perfectly and fluidly that it heightens the audience's connection to the characters. La La Land is such a beautiful looking movie, deserving of every technical award it receives, best experienced personally.Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are once again dynamite and electric as an on-screen couple from their previous roles in Crazy, Stupid, Love and Gangster Squad. Built on the back of their performances, La La Land could never succeed as a romance film without the two protagonist's chemistry. Instead of looking like speaking rehearsed lines, Stone and Gosling convey a sense of genuine love and likability as their characters undergo development.Stone plays Mia Dolan, a barista aspiring to be an actress. Gosling plays Sebastian Wilder, a pianist with a passion for jazz. Their life and ambitions are intertwined in Los Angeles. Mia continues to audition for roles, without success. Sebastian somehow achieves stardom and financial stability when his former classmate Keith, played by John Legend, offered him to be the pianist of his jazz fusion band. The part requires him to be on tour for months or years, away from Mia. His commitment leads to a fight against Mia when she protested his acceptance of the role, which is against his musical philosophy. Earlier suffering an embarrassing performance due to low attendance, leading to the inability to pay back the theater, and Sebastian's absence, Mia breaks up with him, moving back to Boulder City to continue her studies and abandon acting altogether. Receiving a call for an audition, Sebastian travels to Boulder City to inform Mia who returns to Los Angeles. After the audition, both confess their love, but uncertain of the future. In the boldest move of the movie, 5 years are skipped. Mia is a successful actress and married to another actor, while Sebastian now owns a jazz club. Going out for a dinner with her husband, Mia inadvertently stumbles to Sebastian's jazz club, aptly named Seb, her original idea during their love life. Noticing Mia among the audience, Sebastian plays their song and a dream sequence occurs of what might have been. Before exiting the club, Sebastian and Mia share a smile as the movie ends.La La Land speaks to everyone's burning desire for glory. However, do we achieve our dreams by ending our relationships with loved ones? Do we sacrifice people with whom we have an emotional attachment to achieve our ambitions? On the surface, the movie ended with both protagonists parting ways but closer inspection reveals that despite ultimately leading diverging lives, Mia and Sebastian retain their love and that it was anchored not by physical attraction but by mutual respect and the desire to see each other succeed. The overarching theme of La La Land, then, is not about the common physical attraction, but ideals of dreams and ambitions. Driven by a character-heavy emphasis, the movie allows the themes to resonate emotionally by the time the credits roll. Damien Chazelle delivers a musical masterpiece with modern sensibilities.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Pleasant enough but ultimately superficial and a little smug,"Blockbuster season and awards season - two periods of the year where it is easy to get caught up in the hype but not always easy to find really good films. In the awards time of year it is particularly hard since everyone is talking up films as much as possible, and lots of 'proper' films come out around then in order to qualify. Last year was no different and La La Land was one of the films that we were all told was a big contender and would surely merit its place surrounded by the great films that had gone before it. Years of disappointment has told me not to get caught up in the hype but just catch things later when they are cheaper and have lost their promotion. With La La Land, that time was now, but the distance has actually only hurt it.More on that in a minute. Generally speaking, La La Land is perfectly fine. It is a pleasant film that has charm and good grace mostly. It wallows in an image of Hollywood that doesn't exist, and fills its delivery with nostalgia and simplification; it is easy to see why it was so popular with those successfully in the industry, and those all hoping that their big break is just around the corner. As a story there is not much too it. The delivery isn't as charming as it needed to be; the musical numbers after that first great one are mostly only okay - they try hard, but they are only okay. The characters are thin, although they benefit from good performances - mostly from Stone, who I really enjoyed. It is nothing special, but it works in a sort of cheerful fantasy way.One year on though, and the #MeToo movement and associated revelations cast a different light on a young woman in Hollywood trying to get ahead. La La Land was a bit smug and fantastical before this, but after it has an air of denial to it too - unintended of course and not the film's fault, but it is there nonetheless, and the cheerful ""have a dream and get your break"" theme stands out badly. Like I say though, not the film's fault - but even without that problem, the film is at best just pleasant to watch but not more.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

A Really Pleasant Experience,"It's so nice that someone was willing to produce an original musical that wasn't animated. Emma Stone and Ryan Goslin light up the screen. The songs are very well written and fit well within the parameters of the romance that develops.

This is a story about dreams and hopes and trying to achieve them in an environment where the chances are really slim.

Pleasant but ultimately forgettable,"I'm not really sure why ""La La Land"" got both critical acclaim as well as a pretty good turnout at the box office. Maybe it's because Hollywood musicals are a rare thing these days, so it seemed fresh and original to people. It's not really a bad movie, I admit. The photography is first rate, the lead actors are likable, and some of the direction of the musical numbers is eye catching. However, the songs in these musical numbers, while easy on the ears, sound pretty much alike for the most part. And they are not really memorable; you'll forget the songs a few hours after watching the movie. Another problem is that the movie moves at a really slow pace. While at first the leisurely pace is refreshing in this era of in-your- face and strident movies, eventually you'll be asking the movie to simply get on with it. The movie is best reserved for a time when you want some pleasant background noise and images while doing a task that involves your main focus. Don't worry about missing any plot points - you'll be able to fill in the blanks easily and correctly.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
The most incredible cinema experience!,"If you are a big musical fan or not this is a gorgeous and must see film! I myself am a huge musical fan and enjoyed it a lot!Surprisingly I did't plan on seeing it but thought I should give it a go and I'm so glad I did. Here is why I loved it so much! ( and may have already pre-ordered it on itunes :)1.Beautiful story-line The screenplay to this amazing movie was so well put together and had little iconic moments throughout the story. I also liked that it wasn't rushed and it took it's time to get through all the important parts of the movie. Who ever wrote the screenplay, I applaud you :)2. Amazing acting Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry together throughout the movie. Together and apart they were so in character the entire time and have really deserved the awards they won at the Golden Globes. Their acting really brought the movie to life and I think they were meant for their roles.3. Incredible music Being a musician myself I enjoyed all the music in the movie. It was so nice to listen to beautiful jazz through the movie and be transported to music where jazz was so popular. It was so great to listen to this music instead of the pop/rap we hear on the radio today. If I had to listen to just the music I would be fine :)Well I hope I've convinced you to go and watch this fabulous movie! You won't regret it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"La La starts fast, crawls at finish.","With its gangbusters intro, appropriately taking place in an LA traffic jam, La La Land looks like it is about to serve notice on the American film musical with an exuberant energy informing the audience it is in for a fun ride. The energy level however begins to waver when the dependence switches from music and dancing to melodrama and the film, divided into seasons (like LA has them) begins to stumble just before Autumn.Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) first meet in less than amicable fashion on the everyday bumper to bumper existence of the LA freeway. Actress Mia works as a barista on a film lot and spends time off going to casting calls that end in disappointment. Sebastian is a quirky, purist, jazz pianist and his own worst enemy when it comes to being employed. The two cross paths again, hook-up and continue their artistic struggle for recognition. When success knocks on both doors it threatens the future of the relationship.La La Land offers up a handful of well done musical numbers, imaginative dance scenes as well as a some early comic friction between the leads but the story line remains banal. Director Damien Chazelle attempts to circumvent this by adding some ""what if"" moments to the story to give it more life but it only packs on more minutes to this already overlong musical.As bargain basement Fred and Ginger the duo offer less than fancy footwork along with pedestrian singing voices but that is part of their charm. Stone at least looks like she is enjoying herself while digging deep enough dramatically to hold some of the films more torpid dramatic scenes together. Gosling is simply a lightweight whose abrasive character offers little to like to begin with and his singing and dancing along with a series of faraway stares grows tiresome by the second half and what started out with the promising chops of another Cabaret eventually degenerates into the mawkish graceless excess of New York, New York.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

"A notch above ""Just OK""","I see a lot of 10-star and 1-star reviews here. I cannot see the justification for either. One of the goals of cinema is ""spectacle"". Yes, you have drama, and comedy. But another way to get to spectacle is the musical. I neither love nor hate musicals, but probably lean closer to not liking them, than liking them. So, I am no expert about singing and dancing. As far as I could tell, the dancing, and much of the singing in this movie was adequate. Nothing blew me away, and nothing made me cringe. Emma Stone has a pleasant voice, and she looked very nice in a girl-next-door sort of way. Ryan Gosling, though, seems singularly non-charismatic, and his singing was ""meh"". In times past, producers would dub better singers for the actors in certain musicals. Everyone knows that Marnie Nixon provided the singing for Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady. I saw some of Hepburn's tape from when she was singing those songs. She wasn't bad at all. But she wasn't Marnie Nixon. Maybe they should have done something like that for Gosling. Overall, I found the film a notch above ""Just OK"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Delivers a fantastical take on a classic story,"This film has a surreal, dream like feeling that persists throughout the movie from the opening dance number to the big number at the observatory and the big finish.

"When the words 'The End 'appeared on the screen, I had to contain the urge to stand up and applaud!","It may not have the depth, meaning or questions that some seek in the seventh art, but cinema is, above all, a spectacle and La La Land is absolutly that. A visual and sonorous spectacle that has not been seen for a long time and will hardly be seen again. This ""musical"" is not one of sing-a-longs (attests to this fact the existence of only 4/5 songs in a film of two hours), so to speak, but of music that is a constant throughout the film. There are in fact 3 cast songs, that are a little meaningless and sung in studio which, not being to my taste, ends ups being understandable as an appeal to the nostalgia of the old musicals that, truth be told, were the first blockbusters. These three more flourished numbers occur in the first 20 minutes of the film, and then what is, in my view, the best film of the 2010's actually begins. The interpretations are excellent, having the main actress more opportunity to shine in great height . The screenplay appears to be simple but develops in such a way that it looks like something of Woody Allen at his best. A story about two people who fall in love and come together to achieve their dreams, open a jazz club and be an actress. But, as I began to say, La La Land is a visual and sonorous spectacle so that the technical characteristics of the film gain even more relevance. The color of the film is extraordinary at every moment and the play of lights in each scene plays a decisive role in that which is transmitted, the background cinematography is a luxury that makes of this a film of obligatory visualization in a theater. As for the sound, no movie ever sounded so good. At any point in the film the viewer sits within the scene thanks to the sonic realism that transports anyone who is watching this play from the audience of a screen to the audience of a stage. Concerning music itself, it is a constant and never below excellent, playing an active role in the unfolding of events and not just a prop to the scene. In this film the song is one of the characters, and is so relevant that the only scene where it is not ""on stage"" gains an impressive dimension.Besideds all these attributes that are well above average is an immaculate directing effort that transforms this cinematic experience into an extraordinary journey through the imaginary of what is a relationship, with love, goals, anger, commitment, happiness, and sacrifice.To finish I leave just one more personal note, when the words 'The End 'appeared on the screen, I had to contain the urge to stand up and applaud such was the feeling of immersion that the film caused.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Finally ending 2016 on the right note...,"Yes, ""La La Land"" is a perfect movie and it's destined to be a classic in my opinion. I went to see it last night and I had to go back today because I kept thinking about it and humming the songs. This is a perfectly crafted film, I have only have positive things to say about ""La La Land"", the movie I needed all year long. Just by watching the trailers I could smell something special with the amazing cinematography and the beautiful music. No need to say the movie exceeded my expectations.The casting of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is simply genius, I heard rumours that they initially had Miles Teller in mind for this movie, but it wouldn't have been the same without Gosling/Stone. This is the third movie with them together as the leads, with the underrated 'Crazy Stupid Love', and the disappointing 'Gangster Squad'. You can tell they were made for this musical, even though Ryan Gosling is not a natural born singer, the performance and the dance numbers wouldn't have been the same without their chemistry. Pretty sure Emma Stone is a lock for Best Actress.Obviously, the production design and the visuals are breathtaking, this is a movie I'm going to watch over and over again for the musical numbers. Most of the times it feels like you are watching a dream and I think this is exactly what Chazelle was aiming for, he succeeded at every level. The synergy between the music, the colours, the camera-work, the editing, the costumes and of course Gosling/Stone made this experience incredibly unique. There is also a lot of layers to 'La La Land', the story was essential to bring those numbers alive. Without spoiling anything, the ending was beautiful.I was not a fan of 'Les Misérables' and 'Chicago', but 'Singin in the Rain' and 'The Sound of Music' are the best musicals ever made. La La Land deserves a place among them, of course we will give the movie some time to breathe, but to me this already is a classic.

"Beautiful film, totally out of the ordinary","This is an instant classic. From the first 2 minutes, it starts singing and dancing with big vistas and picturesque cinematography. As someone who isn't very fond of musicals, and especially new ones where the music just doesn't sound as good as the 1950s classics, this has some amazing music.It's also beautiful art in cinema. Long, flowing shots with complex choreography of dancers, props and the camera rig, this is high craft. It's dreamy, always lush with contrasting colors in light or wardrobe. It's a big, satisfying visual-fest that drips off the screen.Most important of all, it's a sweet story. Two lovers who are perfectly matched, but with timing that couldn't be more wrong. I'm not a big fan of either actor, but they pulled me in and had be interested until the end.Was it perfect? No. Is anything? It's about 15 minutes too fat in the running time. Nips and tucks would've helped. It would've been a masterpiece at 1:45 in length. And, the Griffith observatory ""dream"" sequence was a bit too much. As my wife said, it kinda jumped the shark there for a couple minutes.All in all, amazing, unique cinema. There's been nothing like this for decades. My advice - sit back and let it wash over you. It will make you happy and leave you with a smile when the credits roll.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Never expected to like this,"I wasn't sure if I was to like this as I tend to duck the hyped titles from Hollowwood.Well the first act of three parts was perky enough to keep me in the evolvement of the story, then the second act dropped the ball with a less than gripping conflict build up as jazz ambition is swapped for easier cash. To me this was the least musical part as it circled this uninteresting part in an attempt to have real conflict of interest. Act three was a 15 minute montage that made a reprise of the developed story and the eternal question of what could have become if we down our path had the chance to choose over, go into other direction and have a life that could have been the fulfilment we ought to have had.
I thought this part was genuinely moving.But musicals are to be full of music, yes ? No ? I was hoping a little for something closer to heart as I was swept by A Chorus Line and All That Jazz.

LaLa Review,"The film, La la Land, is a story that is carried more by color and music than plot or characters. That is not to say that the plot or characters take away from the film. By nature, musicals tend to compromise character traits and logical scenes for visuals and song. People do not just randomly break into songs or dance to choreographed music. It is difficult to create a musical because the songs should further the plot, fit the characters and not feel too out of place. This film does a decent job of matching the character's songs to their personalities, but I believe that the focus of this movie lies with the colors. The colors in this movie are widely varied both in locations and outfits. Mia, the main character, wears several different dresses throughout the film. These dresses vary wildly in color and appearance. The purpose of the dresses appears to be mostly aesthetic, giving Mia an outfit that would compliment the rest of the scene and make her stand out. La la Land is a film that focuses heavily on aesthetics. These dresses are used in conjunction with several scenes where the lighting changes to emphasize a specific color. This is used to convey emotion as well as pull the viewer's attention to Mia and her actions during these scenes. Scenes with dramatic lighting like this often end up showing more emotional aspects of the story. As a musical, how a character moves and looks is incredibly meaningful to the story. Some of the most striking examples of the use of color include when Mia and Sebastian meet at the moment Sebastian is fired and when Mia and Sebastian argue over his dreams. There are also several scenes that use color together with a low lighting such as when Mia enters the bathroom, walks home, or sings for her recital. These scenes all take advantage of color to highlight both the characters and the atmosphere. Another aspect that this film takes advantage of is the movement of the characters and camera. It is not just the dancing that is eye catching, although that is one of the main uses of movement utilized by the film. When Mia and Sebastian first enter the observatory, the camera spins around displaying the room. This eventually leads to a dance in the star filled observatory itself where the characters appear to be dancing among the stars. I am sure that this is a reference to something, although I am not sure what. This film is very much a product of it's time. It is full of references to other movies, both through the parody of specific scenes and the characters directly mentioning other movies of the time. I believe that a portion of what endears this movie to people is the nostalgia of remembering great movies of the past. This is not inherently a bad thing, but younger members of the audience who may not remember such movies, will not be able to receive the full experience the film was designed to provide. The plot of this movie is relatively simple. The main characters fall in love and decide to follow their dreams, end up failing and break up only to seize the chance to follow their dreams again. One interesting feature of the film is that, while both characters are able to realize their dreams, these dreams cause them to part ways, effectively ending the romantic plot as they each go to live their own lives. There is a happy ending, but it can be seen that they compromised their relationship for the sake of their dreams. It is possible that they could have made everything work out 'perfectly', but I think such an ending would be much less satisfactory and that their ability to each pursue their own dream to fruition is what makes them such likable characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"Heart warming, highly poetic and gorgeous","""La La Land"" is a fantastic movie, better than what I could have expected before watching and it has rapidly became one of my favourite movie ever. I loved Whiplash (Damien Chazelle's previous work) but this one is something special. ""La La Land"" is about a couple and their love story, which I have to admit isn't something too particular or too original, even if I liked a lot the ending because it was something different but nothing that was never seen. The real merit of this movie is the way in which everything is portrayed, starting from the magnificent direction by Chazelle to the score by Hurwitz, including the great cinematography and all the cast. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were both exceptional (in particular in the last 20 seconds) considering they also had to dance and sing, in which they were pretty amazing. Generally I don't like musicals but ""La La Land"" is different because first of all I found more contextualised the dancing and singing scenes than a usual musical, secondly they are gorgeous. And all the movie in particular is highly poetic because of its bright colours that warms the heart, of the music which is fantastic and so thoughtless that brings you away from your dimension to make you live two hours in this pocket universe in which you feel light and without any mass. And you look around to the bright colours and you listen to the music played and you elevate yourself like the protagonists in a memorable scene. I know that it seems like a very good trip but I wasn't high, it was just the movie that provoked me all these feelings and emotions. For this reason I loved every single moment of it and it's one of my favourite movies ever. So if you haven't watched ""La La Land"" yet, be sure to check it out. It's unlikely that everyone loves it as much as I do, but the poetic aspect of it really touched some cords in my heart, maybe will do this even for you. And if not it is however visually stunning, sweet to hear and it has an enjoyable story, so it is worth watching anyway.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
very ordinary movie,"The movie was very normal, i don't know why there was so much propaganda about it.

Disappointing,"Ryan Gosling: They may as well of had a piece of driftwood ""acting"" opposite Stone. This guy is so useless I was embarrassed for him. To start with, he sounds retarded (is he?). His 'serious face' makes him look constipated (I was half expecting him to let one rip the entire way through). I've seen stroke victims with a wider range of expressions than him. He's so vanilla, lame, boring, possessing a total lack of charisma. The best reviews he ever had were for roles with barely no lines, ""moody"" films like 'The Place Beyond the Pines' and 'Drive' when all he had to do was sulk!. If he wins an Oscar for on the back of this performance it will be an absolute travesty! He can't sing, he can't dance, and literally sucks the life out of every scene he's involved in.Now Emma Stone is lovely, She's 'sweet' but one dimensional in that she's always playing the same character. This was a gross miscasting. you can't help but pity her when she sings, it's like your 5 year old niece at a school play, but worse, no depth or range at all, completely drowned out by the music in every scene. She has some rhythm when it comes to dancing, but the set pieces are so laughably childish it's hard to gauge her true capabilities (clearly dumb-ed down to accommodate Gosling's lack of talent). To make matters worse, time has not been kind to Stone. Whatever youthful looks she may or may not have had are long gone. Her face is beginning to morph into yet another plastic Hollywood mess. She's not hot, she's not sexy, but neither is Gosling so I guess in that respect they're evenly matched...The script was OK. Stone's character begins and ends the same with no progression mentally and Gosling;well he's so boring you just give up caring. However; the rest of the cast were stellar. John Legend has some smooth vocals but he is rather oily. Had they cast people with real talent in the lead roles then I think this could have been magnificent. Worth mentioning;The cinematography was excellent, visually stunning, an orgy of colour bursting out from the screen in each and every scene; and the songs, although forgettable, had a certain unique charm to them. I predict a theatre production in the near future.To sum it up, If your date makes you chose between this and Titanic, I'd chose this. Just don't go expecting it to live up to the hype.

La La Land is a musical/romantic/comedy movie where we be following the journey of the two main character, Mia by Emma Stone and Sebastian by Ryan Gosling both academy nominee and winner, actor and actress that had an outstanding performance into their roles. Both actor and actress were lovable, cute, and gorgeous that is perfect for each other but not all story has a happy fairy tale ending. It is a journey through love and career with a wonderful jazz musical piece that would take your breath away.The musical in this movie is dreamy, magical, with a good level of detail by the youngest Oscar best director winner, Damien Chazelle into using old camera, Panavision XL2 that captures the images with a rich and most colourful visuals which what made this movie magical, due to the fact that old cameras captures visuals more highly saturated compared to the modern cameras which capture images at its most realistic that makes films now boring and felt flat. Justin Hurwitz that made the most fascinating score and songs for this movie which made this movie stands out among other movies.For me this movie, is possibly one of the best movies I've watched in my lifetime that made me loved Jazz even I'm not really into Jazz music. It is one of those rare gems that you need to find among thousands and thousands of films released every year and finding this movie had been really an eye-opening for me. Overall it's a sad and loving movie with wonderful musical and excellent cinematography that takes on the journey of love with jazz, and I urged everyone to watch it once in their lifetime to experience this cinematic experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Resolution is another climax. So beautiful and classic,"Lovely, so sweet, and so tearjerking. Great music, acting, and performance. I never watched a movie like this to the end.

It Ain't Funny Girl,"I'm not a fan of musicals, but with all the rave reviews I thought I should at least watch it before turning my nose up. I guess you have to be a fan of musicals or a fan of one of the actors, I was neither.Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a piano jazz player insisting on playing only pure jazz but finds the lure of the dollar to hard to resist. Mia (Emma Stone) is a struggling actress working as a barista in between auditions. They fall in love just as their careers take unexpected turns.As for me, it took to long to get into the story, but it did keep me intrigued as to where would Sebastian and Mia's careers take them? Would they stay together? Would they break up and then get back together? Good movie for the teen girl sleepover.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

La La Nice,"I appreciate the freshness and daring of the modern day musical and thought both Emma and Ryan gave solid performances.

City of Stars,"La La Land is a wonderful musical movie that tells the story of Mia (played by Emma Stone) and Sebastian (played by Ryan Gosling) and how they follow their dreams while also falling for one another.This movie reminded me of the musicals I saw when I was little (since I haven't watched one in years) and why these kind of movies are so lovely. The performances are on spot and of high quality, really gave me the sense of realism. Also the soundtrack is marvelous with songs like ""City of Stars"", ""A Lovely Night"", ""Another Day of Sun"" or ""The Fools who Dream"". The cinematography was a delight... so many wonderful pictures and the mood that they were shot on gave the movie more realism (as if it didn't have enough already). The story was good... but sometimes felt a little bit sudden. And this is my only issue with the movie. There were some scenes that just happened without some good context to them... and I was like: ""ok how did we get here?"" but it didn't bothered me so much so that it could ruin the experience I had with this movie. Also there moments in which I was like: ""This is gonna happen next!"" Buy again it didn't bothered me or made me feel I was wathing a predictable movie. The execution was what made me enjoy it, even though some scenes were predictable. There was even some comic relief in it but it never seemed forced or in there just for the sake of being in there (like most of the recent Marvel movies). There is a scene at the end that will make most people cry... no spoilers here... I almost did and it was so surprising to see this type of scene done like it was done here, in a musical movie but it worked wonderfully to enhance the heart that this movie had.Overall a wonderfull movie that I longed to see it for quite some time now since it won 6 oscars this year. I would highly recommend it to musical movie lovers and to anyone who wants to watch a movie with good story and good acting by both the leading actors. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Musical's are meant to suck,"I used used to say I hate musicals but after watching Hamilton and La la land I've come to the conclusion I only hate crappy musicals. I watched la la land inadvertently, all I knew was it was nominated for and won awards so I was shocked I found out it was a musical, but I was already there so I kept on and tried to keep an open mind to maybe understand why it's so highly acclaimed. What I loved the most about la la land is even after you take all all the singing and dancing aside, it's still a good movie. I'm a sucker for romance so for a long time that's how I convinced myself I liked it; the love story it told between two struggling artists. I've now grown to admit I like it just because it's a good movie.And Hamilton. That I watched with intent, I'd heard a few songs that I liked and when I googled them I was shocked to see it was from a movie adaptation of a play. I'd been to a theatre play that I enjoyed so I was more open minded to this than la la land. I went through British curriculum in school so I never learnt about america and it's founding fathers, atleast not in detail, hence why my favorite thing about this is it felt like a fun history lesson, enjoyable way to educate yourself in under 3hrs. Unlike la la land there was no talking in between songs, the whole movie's dialogue is through them and you need to listen, fortunately the performances are stellar so I really did enjoy it. La la land was just an amazing love story, but Hamilton had romance, war, politics and the soundtrack was amazing and for that I think it'd be hard to find a better musical.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Not for me,"I'm not giving 1 star to this movie just because I don't like it, but this movie is just not for me.In my opinion, none of them, I mean Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are good singers, so that wasn't something I liked, even because I don't like much the musicals, but on the other hand I loved some other musicals, but not this one, this movie is absolutely boring and listening to them singing is a bit painful.For some reasons, I'm not a fan of Emma Stone, but I appreciated her in other movies.Let's say that Emma Stone and this musical don't give as a final result an Oscar prize, but as everyone would understand, I'm wrong. Her Oscar talks clearly, but it doesn't matter, to me, in this movie, Emma Stone doesn't deserve an Oscar.Anyway this is just my opinion and everybody should watch this movie and after that deciding whether this movie is great or overrated.Enjoy!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Starts Well,"Ryan Gosling is Seb, an immensely talented pianist who wants to play pure jazz. Emma Stone is Mia, a would-be actress who can't get closer to the movies than working as a barista on the Warner's lot. Together they star in La La Land, a note perfect but curiously joyless musical from writer/director Damien Chazelle.While the movie as a whole hits all the right notes for this lover of Freed unit musicals (I enjoy a tremendous variety, but for me, the Freed unit was the best), I have the feeling that everyone wanted to make a musical but was afraid the audience wouldn't understand. So we get an opening production number on the freeway with a crab dolly zooming around the stuck cars, a bit of a challenge dance, and a big romantic dance to the sky at the Griffith observatory. Then things fall apart. The songs are decent, the performances endearing (I'm surprised Gosling's character isn't named ""Danny Maguire""), but the musical performances are restrained and even tromped on; Miss Stone's singing is performed in a weak, quavering voice until her solo at the end, at which point she lets loose with a pleasant, if unexceptional voice. The ballet at the end shows what should have happened, but did not. The result is a pleasant movie that should please the not too critical, but in the end shows a failure of courage, and the result is an effort at irony that renders the movie self-effacing rather than ebullient.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

La La Land ShowMeTheMovies Review,"Critically acclaimed and currently totaling 14 Oscar Nominations, 11 BAFTA Nominations, and 7 Golden Globe wins, musical La La Land is not as incredible as you would expect. Myself and guest writer Natasha tell you why...Plot Summary La La Land's centres on Seb (Ryan Gosling), an overqualified restaurant pianist with a penchant for Jazz, and Mia (Emma Stone), an aspiring actress lacking in successful auditions. Upon meeting, Mia and Seb push each other to make their struggling dreams a reality, and the movie follows how their relationship moulds as they attempt to reach their goals.He Said... Damien Chazelle, director of La La Land, clearly knew with this project that he was on to a winner; but why did he have to make such a song and a dance about it?! With its' dazzling aesthetic and charm, it is difficult to imagine La La Land going home empty-handed at this years' Academy Awards, particularly for costume design and cinematography. Emma Stone clearly the star of the show, I felt Ryan Gosling's performance was not particularly special, nor any of the rest of the cast bar Stone. For its' praised musical elements, certain shots (and songs) were overused at times - every other song, it appeared, would open with dimmed lights and a spotlight on the performer (*eye roll*). Perhaps due to the overwhelming acclaim it has already received, my expectations were set high - and La La Land was not the solid 10/10 I had hoped it to be. The plot itself wasn't overly ambitious, and through all its glitz and retro glamour had an aura of arrogance despite being far from perfect.She Said... Did I like La La Land? Of course! Did I love it? Hmm, perhaps not.. With fantastic use of colour and costumer, as well as a hint of Baz-Luhrmann-esque beauty in its' shots and cuts, the storyline and catchy songs kept my intrigue until the end. But whilst I understand some of the hype, I can't help but feel it could have been a little less pretentious. This self-indulgent piece of cinema portrayed a bland Ryan Gosling, some fairly odd pacing (or total lack there-of), and an unusual, disappointing lack of chemistry between Gosling and Stone. Emma Stone was breath-taking as ever - endearing, gawky and not afraid to laugh at herself - but I felt paired with far too 'Hollywood' a role. The films' music (think 20's speakeasy & Parisian jazz cafe contrasted with blatant cheese), whilst catchy, was paired with some fairly mediocre singing and dancing. The whole thing just seemed a bit unnecessary, and its' overzealous approach to the arts just reminded me of the movie Midnight in Paris (FYI, not a favourite of mine). My final words? Over-hyped but a fun ride.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Robbed of Best Picture,"I can see why this won Best Picture, even if it was only for 30 seconds. This film was fantastic! I'm not usually a fan of live-action musicals, which is why I waited to rent this one, but this was a great movie! Although, it is a little pretentious and narcissitic, but hey, it's an Oscar-nominated film. That's the very definiton. Given that this is the only movie that I've seen Ryan Gosling in, I can't really compare his role in this film to previous works, so for what I got it was great. His singing is pretty good. And now we move to Emma Stone. As far as acting goes, she was fantastic, but her singing ability is average, and at times a bit off key. I've heard better, but I've definietely heard worse. This movie goes into date-night movie territory, but never chick flick territory, thank goodness. (Hey, I'm a guy. I'm not the target audience for those). Overall this was a fun romp, and it deserved every award it was nominated for and won with the exception of Best Costume Design. (What costumes? It's just regular clothes.) The story was pretty good, the chemistry between Gosling and Stone was believable, although sometimes the drama and arguments were a bit overacted, and the choreography and songs were awesome! I am going to be listening to the soundtrack on repeat for a long time. I cannot get these songs out of my head. It's a mix of jazz, pop, funk, a little bit of everything. There's something for everyone to love in this fun musical romp.

La La Land of Extremes,"I liked La La Land. A throwback to movies about people, relationships and the serendipity that leads to relationships. As I read the reviews of others though it seems like people either were enraptured with love or possessed of hate towards it. I see this in may other reviews on the site. This was not the best movie I've ever seen but I like to see a movie like this once in a while that takes us back to an earlier time. Sentimental, yes. But I like how the movie lifted the viewer into this fantasy where the shallow world of Hollywood meets the simple, sweetness of two people in love. The music and dance added to the overall sense of fun and helped portray the ups and downs of a blossoming relationship.

I love the music very much, though I don't know the name of the composer. I myself love to play the piano like the male protagonist Sebastian.

Over-hyped,"I must be missing something here. I went to see this expecting something fantastic given that it had 14 Oscar nominations - including Best Actor and Best Actress. I left feeling very disappointed and wondering what all the hype was about.A song and dance movie, with stars that could neither sing nor dance. How does that work? The answer is very plain - it doesn't. The best dancing in the film was the one where the dancers were in silhouette. There was a nice flowing movement to it and the two dancers moved gracefully. This was meant to be the two leads dancing, but I suspect that this dance was performed by 'proper' dancers - it was so different is class from the dances where Gosling and Stone were visible.With competent performers, it might not have been half as bad - but I still don't think it would warrant all the accolades it has been given. The story was a bit predictable, and the whole film about 20 minutes too long.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

La La Land will surprise ANY viewer in a GOOD WAY!,"The incredible work and vision of the creator Damien Chazelle with La La Land seems to have surpassed expectations and the known problems of putting movie musicals together.Another Day of Sun
A glaring beginning with song and dance on a crazy hot Los Angelas freeway bridge in the full heat of the day. The first scene opens with dancing, singing, and acrobats setting the whole mood with the first words of the song in the middle of a traffic jam, keeping both your eyes, and ears glued to a scorching bridge over the freeway. Little by little you're given a chance to peak into the lives and circumstances of two struggling creatives who find each other through some very particular circumstances not once, but 3 times. Their personalities seem to collide but they decide that there is an ironically funny circumstance driving them to be together.Someone in the Crowd
La La Land is a cutely colorful para nostalgic style story that captures the unsaid hunger of those who set out on to make their way to make it in the entertainment business, and get caught in life. Some end up breaking through the bonds of normal expectation and they get a few breaks. Some end up working a low paying job with very few benefits, with just enough money to run from audition to audition for a movie role.A Lovely Night
In the style somewhat of Fred Estare and Ginger Rogers, the eclectic version of the life of Los Angeles wannabe stars is played out by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. All the scenes in this almost tangible movie musical make you want to be there, you want to see the stars, you want to smell the fresh air, you want to dance and look over the edge of the hill to see downtown Los Angelas in the glowing hue of the sunset.City of Stars
The solo warm tones of piano with a lonely piano player who meets a great girl brings you into the essence of a romantic interlude appreciating the atmosphere.
Gaslights illuminate the boardwalk pier as Ryan Gosling strolls and sings, offering a true performance of the professional he is. The night seems to sing along with him. He dances his way over the walk as the stars and the night become the best friend of Sebastian, the character he plays.Let's Start a Fire!
The appearance of John Legend is a surprise that lends to his first debut in a movie with a speaking part. His music was impeccable for the scene. Let's start a fire!La La Land

For those who were left bewildered by the ending, here's some clarification so you won't be left scratching your head. (The following is not a spoiler but references the last scene.)

People are missing the point!,"I had to write this review as so many musical purists are completely missing the point. I'm fed up of reading that the lead actors can't sing or dance and that that makes it a bad film. This is nonsensical as this film is an evolution of the musical not a musical made in the 50's. I would argue that most of the classic musical greats, contain awful and hammy acting which do not resonate with a contemporary audience and do not make them bad films. By having actors perform a musical in a real and raw way is what drew people in and made the film relatable; we look at Emma stone dancing on the screen and think 'I could do that'.To judge this film on the actors singing and dancing is missing the point - just as some did with Les Miserables. The beauty of this film is the drama, humour and romance created by talented actors, acting their socks off. (Ok apart from Ryan gosling who looks like he could tap dance through a terror attack and I mean that as a compliment.) the musical numbers are endearing and are tools used by the director to make you feel for the characters, not as a recording for an album!I can normally find a small fault, with even the best films, but I could not for La La Land which is why I have given it a 10. Needless to say the cinematography is gorgeous, while the costume design has inspired me to make an appointment with my tailor.Lastly, the ending reflects the authenticity of the performances by being based in reality, ironic considering the location of the movie, and again relatable. Interestingly I watched this film at a specific time of my life and it reminded me that there is not just one route to a happy life. That is what I took away from la la land. Oh and that I want to be Ryan gosling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Nowhere close to a waste of a Lovely Night,"From the very first scene, La La Land captures your interest in a vice and never lets go. It was so magical, visually stunning, and the songs will stay with you long after you leave the theatre. And, despite La La Land being a musical, when people weren't singing and dancing it still had the feeling of a regular movie, which made the story itself captivating. 
I don't think Emma Stone has ever given a better performance than this. She was good in Birdman, sure, but she soared in La La Land. One scene in particular that sticks out to me is ""The Audition"", during which she was able to sing a beautiful solo while the camera circled around her; all in one take. On the contrary, my only criticism is that Ryan Gosling wasn't doing much acting while he was singing and dancing. He is a very gifted singer, and a lovely dancer, but his face remained a little deadpan during musical numbers. 
But the whole movie is damn near perfect. It was interesting story-wise, the music was fantastic, it made me happy, sad, and made me dance in my seat. 
But what really makes this movie, to me, is the ending sequence. That was what made La La Land ""perfect"". It tied everything together so beautifully, but also left some room for the viewer to do their own thinking, and it even made me, who has cried during only one other movie ever, shed a tear. 
La La Land is surely going to make cinematic history. It's new and exciting, and it's an experience you surely won't want to miss it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Fantastic and really philosophical at the same time.,"The musical romantic comedy-drama film was directed by Damien Chazelle and is set in sunny Los Angeles. It is based on love and life's wishes. The story centres on the relationship between Mia Dolan, an aspiring actor and Sebastian Wilder, a struggling jazz pianist. The main characters are played by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.
 
The film opens with the main character, Mia, who is disheartened from her subsequent acting audition. That night Mia's roommates take her to a lavish party in the Hollywood Hills, promising her that somebody in the crowd will start her film career, but in the end she left this party in disappointment. During a musical gig at a restaurant, Sebastian slips into a passionate jazz improvisation despite warnings from the owner to only play songs from a traditional Christmas setlist. While going home, Mia overhears him playing. She enters the restaurant, but Sebastian is fired for his disobedience. Mia attempts to compliment him, but he brushes her off.For many people, the best thing about La La Land is the melodious music, which is presented throughout the whole musical. For me, however, the film succeeded because it has an important and strong message. I can't see anything negative about the film, I was absolutely delighted.I would recommend La La Land - it is so emotional, if you like to reflect about life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Falling in love has become a trend and less emphasis is being given to the process of growing in love, even if it may end up in two people not being together. It is all about making those selfless sacrifices whenever required, wanting the best for each other amidst all the challenges and adversities.

Bad but in a really bad way,"A film that fails the Turing test - in reverse. Or something. What I mean is that after the first 5 minutes the unpleasant sensation crawled over me that I was participating in a rather sinister experiment, watching a movie made by a computer which was testing me by attempting to provoke a human-like response. Stuffed with algorithms culled from proper movies and musicals, the computer has generated a script and a set of scenarios based on user-preference and targeted directly at my very own demographic! Its eerie; the songs sound like songs but aren't quite, the dialogue sounds like people but not quite, nothing that happens has a real reason or point other than to crank through the plot, the jazz looks like jazz and sounds like jazz but isn't, quite, and the set-ups calculated to provoke an emotional effect left me untouched and feeling slightly hollow. What has been thrown, hurled and heaved at this film is Oscar-seeking acting, Oscar-seeking direction and Oscar-seeking technical twiddling. And hey ho and guess what, it got Oscars. Its the apotheosis of junk food, finally.

But... I... hate musicals???!,"I really do hate musicals. As soon as people start singing and dancing in a series or movie, I turn it off. Never watched through any musical movie or even an episode in a series. It just feels so wrong and out of place. I hate musicals down to a molecular level! A musical must have killed me in a previous life or something, I cannot explain it.But this... This is something else. Its a masterpiece. After a year of putting of seeing the movie, I could no longer deny the IMDB score 8.0 from 428000 people and the fact that this was also the writer and director of Whiplash (which I loved!), so I gave it a chance one evening.I was awestruck.My greatest regret is that I did not get to see it in the cinema with a large screen and with a great audio.

One of the best looking musicals!,"Absolutely beautiful and colourful! Such a joy to look at, with popping colours and stylish costumes. A lot of effort when into every single shot, which I fully appreciate.The music is phenomenal with City of stars being my new favourite song from a musical. I thought there would be more songs but the ones in the film are so catchy and upbeat. Both Emma and Ryan did great jobs with the singing and acting, each making the characters feelings come alive.It also uses cinematography fantastically, my favourite shot being the powerful audition scene.

La la la la...,"La la la la...afterwords I left the cinema theater dancing with my girlfriend lifted by a strange feeling that my dancing, the film, the la la la life is not real. Anyways, movies are not real but part of reality. I dislike liking La la land. That was a kind of film with all the right musical formulas applied to it, but something was wrong. See the leading actress, Emma Stone. She seemed pretending to be that girl who strives in the artistic lifeline waiting her turn. The same happens for the main actor. They are good actors; the screenplay helped the film to get its end in a professional way. In the end, a good moral message. This total sum is less than its parts. Why? Maybe musical films are out of date because our era is an era of breaking stereotypes and most musicals bear lots of stereotypes. To watch La la Land was like to eat the same favorite sandwich over and over because it feeds you well but you are undernourished sorry. La la land is good but after an hour or so you feel kind of hungry.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Yes, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are both charismatic actors and enjoyable to watch, but even they are not able to move the film above average plus.

One of my pet peeves with musicals is when the music comes in without any reason other then to have a musical number at that moment.

All this praise?  You' ve got to be kidding!!!,"I guess the power of advertising remains a marvelous and powerful medium that has but one goal: To make more money. And, in my view, La la land delivers the perfect example of this clever but unfortunate phenomenon. Of course everyone will go to see it, (even I did after all). It will undoubtedly make a bundle for its producers and investors and may quite possibly even win a few awards that increasingly appear to be handed out with the sole intention of increasing a film's profits even further.How can this possibly happen? Is it really all about money? What did all of these people that saw the film see that I didn't? Admittedly, not much attention should be paid to Mr and Mrs Public who will continue to slavishly follow the opinions of others and are perfectly satisfied to have their minds dulled by average entertainment. But what about the critics (e.g. IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes among others), and especially the ones who are actually paid to deliver a service and whom one hopes and trusts to be just a little objective? Who can be trusted not to mislead the earnest movie lover these days?I fully appreciate that taste differs, but please please tell me what exactly separates this film from mere, unabashed mediocrity? In considering this just for a moment, one is mindful of some of the musicals of the 50s (Hit the Deck is just one) that did not possess the money machine, camera work, and technological advantages that are readily available today. It bears pointing out that La la land is a mere pale shadow of some of those films of so long ago.More to the point: In my view La la land is a mediocre effort, not worthy of the actors' talents, nor of that of the Director who, after all, gave us the wonderful Whiplash. I do have to say that Emma Stone does her absolute best against almost impossible odds and gives a great performance, but Ryan Gosling is not only miscast, but displays no visible energy for his co-star. He appears somewhat wooden, stiff and almost disinterested in the movie and this describes his dancing and singing as well. The film's editing furthermore leaves a lot to be desired and creates a disjointed feeling for the viewer. It is almost as if some of the scenes were just thrown together haphazardly in a hurry in a boring and predictable script.I really could go on and one may wonder why I have spent so much energy in criticizing this film, but I simply cannot believe the accolades that it continues to receive and this upsets me greatly.Finally, after seeing La la land, I was left feeling dissatisfied and somewhat angry at having sat through it.

Hits the right notes,"I'll be honest. Musicals are probably my least favourite genre. They simply do not interest me. After hearing the acclaim this film has gotten and the fact that it's directed by Damien Chazelle, I decided to give it a go. This is the best musical I've seen so far.La La Land follows Mia, an aspiring actress, and Sebastian, a pianist, who fall in love whilst trying to achieve their aspirations for the future.Before seeing the movie, I wondered what all the hype surrounding La La Land was. After watching it I was extremely impressed by Chazelle's vision for the movie as well as the performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. This movie starts off with an amazing song and dance number that looks like it's done in one take and lasts for five minutes. This is just one of many astounding musical moments. Not that just but the way each scene flows into a musical number was handled immensely well. Usually when people burst into song and dance, I tend to roll my eyes but I loved every single song and dance in La La Land. The long takes, stunning camerawork and choreography made me realise how passionate Chazelle was towards filmmaking and music. It wasn't just the aesthetics but the actual songs were memorable. It's been a while since I watched the film and the songs are still playing in my head.If that already wasn't enough, the performances are stellar. I believe this is a career best performance from Emma Stone. She was fabulous. Ryan Gosling is always a win and his chemistry with Stone is perfect. Their romance is believable and you root for them through the entire journey. There is an iconic dance sequence involving them both and seeing them dance for the first time was exciting.Whilst the story isn't anything new and rather quite predictable, the message that it's trying to tell you has so much heart. Many people say this film is a love letter to LA and that is evident through the gorgeous cinematography of the city but I think it's a film for people who have dreams and want to achieve their goals to be successful in the future. Plus the film pokes fun at Hollywood through its representation of Hollywood parties and auditions.Damien Chazelle deserves all the praise for his creative vision on this film. He's slowly becoming one of my favourite directors working today. With Whiplash and La La Land, I feel he will go very far. La La Land is filled with incredible musical numbers, beautiful cinematography and terrific performances by both leads that culminates in a finale that will bring out the tissues.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"Beautiful photography, disappointing musical","I was expecting a lot from this movie, from the reviews and everything people were saying about it ... it was quite the disappointment.I liked ""Moulin Rouge"" or ""Mama mia"" way more.The photography of the movie was beautiful. When scenes fade to black to put the main protagonists at the center of the pictures, these are well done. Emma Stone is extremely photogenic and looked great in that picture. Ryan Gosling has the charm he is known for. Color, contrast, visuals, these were great to see. Some of the scenes almost felt like paintings or work of art.Emma Stone range of emotions and acting are that of a great actress. She gave life to the movie. I wasn't really convinced by Ryan Gosling acting though. He always seem to play the same guy in all of his movies :s.About the songs and the pace of the movie, they felt really really dull. I kept looking at my watch and waiting for it to be over. Maybe a second screening is necessary but that was the feeling I had while watching the movie.The songs didn't feel full of energy, they mostly made me want to sleep.The main issue I had with the ""story"" of the movie is that it goes in messy plain delirium sometimes.The instrumental parts, without any people singing, were really good. Especially the piano parts. These were the parts that lent the most emotions and getting us to dream in my humble opinion. I could close my eyes and just feel the music.All in all, beautiful photography, disappointing musical.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

To the fools who dream,"""Art is the shortest road between two people"" André Malraux. I have never before revisited the cinema over and over again to watch a movie. La la land is the kind of movie that awakens the soul and leaves you feeling more, thinking about your dreams, your life, the world around you and inside you. I will not attempt to describe the film's plot, as it is not what matters here. All you need to know about this magical film is in Seb's (Ryan Gosling) eyes as he lays one last look on Mia (Emma Stone) right before 'the end' hits the screen. An entire lifetime and a whole movie in one shot. If Casablanca had it's 'this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship' line, la la land has gosling's look, no words needed. This movie, as it promises, is certainly 'one for the dreamers'. But it conceals so much beauty, magic and soul in merely two hours, that even the most cynical of the viewers will leave the movie theater as changed romantics. Only if for a night...P.S. turns out people do love what other people are passionate about.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Nothing like it,"This may be the best movie I've ever seen. It brilliantly uses the trappings of 1940's and 50's movie-musicals to make something entirely unique. I have only seen a few of those movie musicals, but this made me want to watch all of them. The movie uses a fairly unique form of nostalgia, so that those who love the old movies want to watch them, but those who don't know the old movies want to track them down. I saw it with a friend who, while he likes stage shows, hates movie musicals, and he loved it. Usually, movie musicals feel like the directors are trying to decompress a stage show, with most of the energy of the stage being lost in the process. This is absolutely not the case with this movie. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with this much energy. This movie also does something that all all fiction should do: it tells a story in a way only that medium can. It uses the locations, the costumes, and the subtle symbolism that would be lost in any other medium.First, if you can see it on a big screen, do so. I usually wind up checking my watch or looking at the curtains or thinking about something not involving the theater when I see something on the big screen, but not with this one. The format of the big screen is used to its best here. The big dance numbers feel grand, and the quiet character moments feel personal and affecting. This is to the credit of cinematographer Linus Sandgren, who should win best cinematography, hands down.The direction of the movie is absolutely astounding. There are many sequences without any spoken (or sung) dialogue that are among the highlights of the movie. I don't know anyone who can do show-don't- tell as well as Damien Chazelle. A lot of character is also reflected in the truly stellar costume designer, Mary Zophres. Not only does these costumes look really, really good, but they are an important indicator of character. For example, the costume we first see Seb in clearly shows the audience that he's really into retro.I would be remiss to review this show and not discuss the jaw- dropping score. The songs are all excellent, with lovely, jazzy melodies by Justin Hurwitz and witty lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. There aren't many of these songs (there's a story reason for that), but they're all gems. I would especially like to call out the final (sung) song, The Fools Who Dream. The melody is somewhat melancholy, but very sweet. The lyrics are witty, with a twinge of sadness. I will talk more about singing and acting later, but this is the song where Emma Stone gives her all. This is also the rare movie where I notice the instrumental score, also by Mr. Hurwitz. It uses recurring themes (or leitmotifs, if you will) absolutely stunningly. Mia and Sebastian's Theme is never sung, but it was one of the songs that I was humming on my way out of the theater. Mandy Moore (no, not that one) takes these tunes and choreographs them with suitably retro sensibilities. This film has drawn many comparisons to Singing in the Rain, and her choreography is a good piece of why. Also, tap dancing. I never get sick of tap dancing.The actors all knock it out of the park, particularly Emma Stone. The movie is tightly focused on Mia (Ms. Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), but the smaller characters are all good. Ryan Gosling plays this role with elegance and arrogance, prickliness and sensitivity. However, he is eclipsed by Emma Stone. Her role is somewhat underwritten, but you wouldn't realize it unless you were staring at the script. Ms. Stone can express more emotion with a slight movement of her eyes than her peers can with their whole bodies. She takes the character and makes her a person in ways the script really doesn't. I will be absolutely shocked if she doesn't win Best Actress in February. The one point of the movie that has some technical flaws is the singing, but I think it's justified. If you are looking to this movie for Big Broadway Belts, you are looking the wrong way. This movie has a quieter style to its singing that works very well. As for the leads, they aren't perfect, but they suit the material they sing. I did not expect Mr. Gosling to sing like that. His singing voice is very unique. Maybe not the greatest technique in the world, but it's very jazzy and distinct. Ms. Stone spends much of the musical singing in her sweet (but slightly breathy) head voice and falsetto, but, as her final song proves, she can also belt. All of the singing is incredibly expressive. The two leads also have glorious chemistry. Every conversation, every dance break, every glance from across the room is believable, and you want these two together the moment they interact.If you like musicals, if you like Emma Stone, or if you care about movies, you should absolutely watch La La Land.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

"If this movie wins 'Best actor in Leading role', rather than a tribute it's gonna be a mockery to Gene Kelly and old Hollywood.","First of all, I like musical films, but this was supposed to be a tribute to the greatest musical performers in old Hollywood (Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, etc.). It was a lie, because it was a cliché love story of a young couple, Sebastian and Mia.The script's structure isn't great neither, narrated by seasons. The characters, Mia (Emma Stone) an aspiring actress, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) a man who wants to make Jazz popular again. The rest of the characters are just there, lost in the script, doesn't matter if they exist. And the end is like the supporting characters too, is like those quickly ending scenes where the movie doesn't feel complete.Now I'll be honest, Emma does her best and gives an acceptable performance, but Ryan can barely sing and is worse when he dances, no coordination with Emma and graceless dance steps disguised by the sound department with tap sounds. The musical numbers are forgettable too, 'City of Stars' is good but no great and the old Hollywood tribute is just a Casablanca's window, Rebel Without a Cause, some posters and dance steps, good joke for publicize the movie.Despite all these, the good things in the movie, the sound editing and mixing. The art direction gives this film different places with urban atmosphere, and the costume design and make-up/hairstyling department also contribute to make the story something that everyone can feel identified.Maybe is for all this the success, but can't match on to classics like Singing in the Rain, An American in Paris, Sound of Music and more. For conclude, if you like musicals, you can enjoy the film, if you want to revive the old Hollywood charm, searchs other movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Return of the unabashed musical,"I've been waiting for a return of the unabashed musical, and this one announces from its opening scene that it's a movie where actors burst into choreographed song and dance routines on the spur of the moment. This is a good thing. Part of the death of the musical involved the casting of actors who could not sing and/or were wrong for the part. Naturally, I was nervous about the casting. Gosling and Stone are good actors; as singers, they're effective, her more so. As a dancer, Gosling is a little clunky. You get the feeling Channing Tatum might have done it better. The plot echoes a 30s musical with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler; though not quite as artificial and stylized. There are also elements of Gene Kelly, including a 50s style ballet sequence. Plot-wise: A struggling jazz pianist and an aspiring actress are looking for a break in Hollywood, fall in love, and struggle when they begin to find success. The romance and much of the comedy echoes Woody Allen's screenplays, especially Annie Hall, and his own musical Everyone Says I Love You (luckily the actors don't _act_ as if they're in an Allen film, no matter how much the script sounds like they should). Story and plot don't tend to matter much in a musical, but the lead characters and the love story works. The style and design are mostly spot on, though it's not a showcase of costume and sets. The editing is a bit odd, and sometimes it seems that the singing is not quite matching the lip movement. When John Legend sings, though his songs are not good, we hear what a polished singer sounds like, and can clearly match his mouth to the sound. None of the songs in the movie are breakout hits exactly. Emma Stone's audition song is the most effective, and/but it heavily echoes Paul Williams (I could hum Rainbow Connection over it). Overall, despite criticism, I think it's a great movie for the present time. It may succeed better as a gimmick, given that this type of musical is so seldom made now. In a year with multiple musicals, I'm not sure how memorable this one would be. I will say, in almost all respects, it's well worth seeing, and probably seeing in a theater for full effect.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Very Good,"Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) a traditional Jazz piano player and Mia (Emma Watson) an aspiring actress meet and fall in love. Sebastian's dream is to have his own Jazz Club and Mia's dream is to be a successful actress.I told them I wanted Westerns to be brought back and what they did was to bring back a Musical. A Musical of all things! Well, it wasn't too bad and it got a lot better after the first 15-minutes when they showed a traffic jam on the freeway and everyone got out of their cars to sing and dance. Pretty lame and you could tell the voices were dubbed in. What was I in for when this movie was nominated for all kinds of Oscars? Someone should have seen those first 15-minutes didn't work. The music was not of the toe-tapping kind the dancing was okay, I guess, but way overdone. I was beginning to think this was going to try too hard. Woe is us.The story really starts when Sebastian and Mia meet and their chemistry was spot on. Kudos. We hear them singing and see them dancing. The choreography was excellent for two actors not known for singing and dancing. Hey, it worked and was enjoyable to watch all the rest of the way.Mia decides her auditions weren't working and starts to write a one-woman play. Sebastian is offered a job by Keith (John Legend). The music here is what I would call Jazz Rock and is meant to bring in the younger crowd because no one really likes traditional Jazz anymore. Or that is what is commonly known. Sebastian doesn't really like this kind of music but it's a job and he needs a job. Things work for a while until troubles come to paradise and we see dream conflicts. Oh, oh.The music and choreography - after the first 15-minutes - were very good and maybe those Oscar nominations were deserved after all. (Of course they were) The movie did get Oscars for: Best Actress: Emma Watson; Best Director: Damien Chazelle; Best Original Song: City of Stars; and Best Original Score.Notable: J.K. Simmons as Bill who fires Sebastian because he wouldn't play the traditional Christmas music and ended up playing some serious Jazz.This may be the start of Musical Revivals, but am still hoping someone will bring back the Westerns.

"Excellent cinematography, soundtrack, and acting from Emma Stone","La La Land really knocks it out of the park as a modern musical that incorporates elements of the classics. While its initial reception was overwhelmingly positive, unfortunately it led to backlash from others, many of whom cited reasons that suggest they are not fans of the genre in the first placeEven the most cynical hater of La La Land and other movies with joy- inspiring visuals and music (think Disney films) would agree that La La Land's cinematography is incredible. It's not just the colors and artistic value of each shot, but the long takes far exceeded my expectations. So we all realized the movie had two six-minute takes, which were impressive in their own right. There were actually many long takes that lasted several minutes, in scenes with just conversations/plot advancement. Completely unnecessary but an example of the kind of work and attention to detail that went into this passion project.The soundtrack has been a hit with millions of viewers around the world. Not much else to say here, as the music clearly was successful at evoking strong emotions within viewers, many of whom bought the soundtrack and relived the movie over and over after leaving the theater.Emma Stone is a brilliant actor and really showcases her talents in La La Land. While there's nothing wrong with Gosling's performance, his character isn't exactly written to be as emotional and expressive - he's simply Sebastian, the jazz-obsessed musician who cares about little else for a good portion of the movie.I've seen this movie several times with people who otherwise wouldn't have watched it, but did hear about its critical success. Most teared up or cried - after all, the themes of love and pursuing your dreams are universal.

"Fresh, light, colorful - but a bit thin","Saw this yesterday. Did not know what to expect. Drama and romance - well, why not. I'm a bit bored of all those superhero space adventure remakes they push nowadays.Surprise! I was a bit scared when it became obvious it's a musical. I don't like many musicals. Well, luckily it was not a typical American musical but just a song here and there. Still, some of the songs felt they were just plastered over the story.What was American, however, was how it was filmed. A lot of static camera with big faces on the screen. Not very ambitious but at least they avoided unnecessary trickery. A few exceptions and traditional cuts played nicely along the story.I loved the colors.The story is a bit thin. I felt a there wasn't that much chemistry between the characters but perhaps that was exactly the point. And it was light at the same time, not very dramatic after all. Refreshing.Singing and music sounded real and not too perfect - which was perfect after all. Sadly there isn't any Jazz clubs in this town. I'd be sitting there very very often. Perhaps I should set up one myself.I can see they tried to copy the vibe of some classic movies but unfortunately fell a bit short. Quite far at the same time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Left me speechless !!,"We Indians love musicals and each movie we make irrespective of the language, has songs and dances. Very rare we make a song less movie.But hats off to Damien Chazelle for writing and directing a musical which beats us in our own game. After watching La La Land, I wondered why we couldn't make a movie like this with the kind of talent Bollywood and rest of the many regional language film industries India has.I don't know where to start about La La Land. The story of young struggling actress and a Jazz musician in LA could have been a run of the mill film but Damien is fine writer. So he does include the clichés but also keeps small twists and turns in the story. He tells the story in forms of the seasons in LA and how life changes like the seasons.And when we audience think that all is fine, he beautifully delivers the hammer blow at the end which left me speechless. When I left the theatre, I was wondering how my life is at the moment and how my life could have been if some dreams had come true. My introspection is the result of power of writing. Pity he didn't won an Oscar for writing.Every frame in the movie looks like a painting and the movie deserves the Oscar for cinematography. And the music is outstanding.Gosling and Stone are a fine couple on screen and their chemistry lifts this film to another level. Both of fabulous actors. Stone beautifully shows the pain of a struggler while Gosling shows the unhappiness inspite achieving success.Whether the film should have won the Best film, well after seeing Moonlight I can tell.

Did La La Land pay off the critics..?,"If you have a 30 million dollar budget, I hope you get some things right. The cinematography and aesthetic quality of the film were pretty great and it had its emotional moments.Emma Stone & Ryan Gosling respectively breathed life into their inherently boring & unoriginal roles. The story itself kinda makes me want to vomit in my mouth, though it did seem like they were going for a rather corny set up so I won't let personal bias get in the way of that.Bottom line, you don't really care about either of these characters. Their love is nothing gripping, its not forbidden or difficult for that matter, and he doesn't even have to try and woo her, just keeps running into her and eventually he must think ""alright might as well give it a try this is the 5th time i've seen her""cannot believe that this has a 99% rating on sites I usually rely on, must be a candidate for the most over-hyped movie of all time, and to the critics that gave it 10 stars shame on you for diluting the quality Hollywood should be able to achieve.If you want an award winning movie that delivers on raw & truthful emotion and the human experience, see what Moonlight did for 1/20th (yes, check me) the budget.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Not even good as a musical,"I went to see the movie because it was 8.7 in IMDb and somebody said its the best movie he has seen since Star Wars when he was 6.... Well we were 2 couples and we left after 30 minutes....Its an awful movieIf you are not into musicals and if you liked Whiplash do yourself a favor. Take a good book and stay home.Its boring, the plot is dull, it is slow and the opposite of inspiring or interesting ....The beginning of the movie has a scene as if inspired by West Side Story... But this is not LEonard Bernstein and the music does not meet the level... Yet, I thought its a Good start..At some point it becomes more interesting and something is happening... but then it is cut and slowed down by a romantic song in the middle of some action and the movie falls down again...This movie does not deserve to be in the top 100 of IMDb...

It's perfect,"I am guessing there is already a lot of reviews here that talk about plot, setting, acting etc. So I am only going to tell you one thing; However cheesy this may sound, La La Land made me feel everything. Happiness and sadness, hope and hopelessness. Whenever I see the title I instantly want to watch it again. The only reason I do not is because I want to forget it first, so that I can experience it the first time again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
The Rise of an Auteur,"Whiplash was amazing. Anybody who saw it, ranked it in the top 3 of 2014. It had a beautiful end, an out of the box yet known premise.All I feared with La La Land were my own expectations. I was more than hyped to see it. So when it released on the 9th of December, I grabbed my two friends to catch it on IMAX.And we were all simply blown away. The acting was top notch, the cinematography will probably win an Oscar. Damien Chazelle, the director is the auteur of our times. His love for jazz comes across even more beautifully this time around.The movie was definitely an improvement over Whiplash.It is realistic yet fantasy like. It moves like a butterfly and stings like a bee.La La Land is nothing short of a modern classic with at least 3 to 4 sequences that will go down in movie history.And no spoilers, but Damien did it again this time around too with the ending.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Dreams in Cinematic Harmony: 'La La Land' Dances Between Reality and Romance,"""La La Land,"" a film that dances on the delicate line between the bitter and the sweet, the past and the present, and dreams and reality, is a cinematic symphony that resonates with the heart's own rhythm. It's a film that captures the essence of the golden age of Hollywood musicals while firmly planting its feet in the modern world, creating a vibrant tapestry of color, sound, and emotion.The film opens with a grandiose musical number set in a Los Angeles traffic jam, a sequence that sets the tone for the entire movie. It's a bold statement of intent from director Damien Chazelle, who orchestrates this complex scene with the precision of a seasoned maestro. The camera weaves through the cars and dancers with such fluidity that one can't help but be swept away by the sheer audacity of it all.At the heart of ""La La Land"" is the romance between Sebastian, a jazz purist played with a charming mix of arrogance and vulnerability by Ryan Gosling, and Mia, an aspiring actress portrayed by Emma Stone with a captivating blend of tenacity and fragility. Their chemistry is palpable, their dance numbers are exhilarating, and their shared dreams are the kind that reach out and pull the audience into their world.Chazelle's vision is one of bold contrasts and dazzling harmonies. The film's use of color is a feast for the eyes, with each frame painted in hues that reflect the characters' emotions. The music, composed by Justin Hurwitz, is both a homage to and a reinvention of classic jazz, resulting in a score that is as memorable as it is melodic.The film's unwavering commitment to its nostalgic aesthetic sometimes borders on pastiche, and its narrative can feel as though it's treading familiar ground. The portrayal of the struggling artist, while romantic, doesn't always hit the mark of authenticity, occasionally glossing over the harsher realities of the pursuit of art.The film's ending, which some may find bittersweet, might not resonate with everyone. It's a bold choice that underscores the film's theme of the sacrifices one must make for love and ambition, but it also leaves a lingering question of what could have been.""La La Land"" is a film that dares to dream in a world that often forgets how. It's a love letter to the arts, to Los Angeles, and to the dreamers who inhabit both. While it may occasionally stumble over its own ambitious feet, it never falls, and for that, it deserves to be celebrated. It's a film that reminds us that even when the music fades, the dance goes on. And isn't that what life is all about?",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Not a masterpiece,"I'll keep this review straight and to the point – I liked La La Land, but I didn't love it, and I'm a little perplexed about why it's a front runner for the Best Picture Oscar. I think the film looks beautiful, from the camera work, to the costumes, and the lighting. Emma Stone also gives a very good performance. But other than that, there's not much else I can really praise. It kept me engaged, but I wasn't riveted by it.La La Land is an attempt to revive the musical genre by giving it a more modern twist. It's about an aspiring actress (Emma Stone) and a struggling Jazz piano player (Ryan Gosling) trying to reach success in their respective industries. They fall in love without much build up and they encourage each other to achieve their dreams, but there are some bumps along the road (I don't want to spoil it). It's a pretty routine bittersweet love story about the conflict between chasing your ideal career and personal happiness.I think the main reason La La Land is getting so much buzz is because it's nostalgic about 1940's musicals and it makes show business seem like an important industry. Hollywood and the critics eat up those kinds of movies. I don't think the songs or the dance numbers are particularly memorable though. Script wise, it's nothing special either. Director Damien Chazelle's camera work and Emma Stone's performance are the real stars here. While I don't think the actual songs are memorable, they ARE filmed well. La La Land deserves many technical awards.I think most people who go into La La Land not expecting a masterpiece will be very pleased. I just don't get the people calling it the best movie of the year. Different strokes for different folks I guess.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"A 100% Recommendation: Magical, Delightful, Sumptuous, Technically Flawless","On the surface La La Land doesn't seem too different to director Damien Chazelle's previous film Whiplash. The two share a jazz-and-Charlie-Parker-obsessed male protagonist, a love of music, and even JK Simmons. However, this film is wholly different and represents staggering new ground covered by Chazelle and the team behind it, as well as being a deliciously unique piece which seems a shoe-in for being the best film of 2016.In fact, La La Land is not only by far the best film I've seen released in 2016, but also possibly 2015. Simply put, everything about it works. Firstly, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are perfectly cast in their roles, with effortless natural likability and chemistry that most actors can only dream of. Gosling provides charm, a believable passion in jazz, and incredible piano skills, whilst Stone is as genuine as ever, and acts as an audience surrogate that is easy to root for.The music will not only make you tap your toes, but also cause you to leave the cinema dancing with a wide grin on your face - I was a moment away from standing up and giving a round of applause when it finished. The songs, beside being well-sung and expertly-choreographed, are easy to re-listen to and are very catchy.On the aesthetic side, the cinematography and the colour palette are beautiful. Highly stylised and with an admirable range of techniques. Some stand-out sequences are the planetarium dance and heart-string-pulling epilogue.Certainly the best thing about the entire film is its spirit and passion. It's so incredibly enjoyable - not a single moment is dull, and though it takes place over a long period of time with a lot of events happening (it is split into winter, spring, summer, fall, and winter again) it is constantly fun. Even in the most dramatic moments it is fantastic to watch, simply for the pure talent on display, and the realness of the drama, despite the almost fantasy-like quality of the film at times.This review cannot go into enough detail about how delightful the film is - it's also worth mentioning the fresh, well-written script (also Chazelle's work) that is often hilarious. Honestly I can think of no negatives right now, and it will just be interesting to see how it holds up a year down the line. A must- watch, though inevitably those who are staunchly critical of musicals may be hesitant. 98/100.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Pure... emotion,"It's very obvious that this movie is made with the utmost passion for both films and music. I found this movie to be enthralling and perfect. I cannot specify how much I loved this movie. Did I mention that I loved this movie... well I do. Unlike a lot of people I talk to I have no problems with musicals and I quite like them. I'm going to make this short and sweet and try to list all the perfect things about this movie.Since it's a musical I feel I should mention that the songs, singing and dancing were absolutely flawless in execution. I especially adored ""Fools who dream"".I am a huge fan of both leads and in my opinion this was a career best performance by the gorgeous Emma Stone and another brilliant performance by Gostling. Their chemistry was 100% believable and they were very ""cute"" together.The plot itself focuses a lot on passion and dedication to that passion. It tries to make people want to achieve their goals and follow their dreams in an active way.Directing and cinematography were absolutely beautiful. I was born in L.A. so this movie made me very nostalgic and it showed the sort of ""artistic"" side of L.A. and I loved it.It is a gripping experience but I would recommend watching this with a significant other. 11/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"An alright film, but not a great musical","I enjoyed ""La La Land"" as a piece of innocuous, colourful escapism. The two leads are endearing and funny, the cinematography is dynamic, the sentimentality plucks rather than gurns and overall I found the dramatic conclusion to the two young dreamer's relationship emotionally fulfilling.However, the 'musical' element of the film was lacking. It's obvious that the spectacle of the old Hollywood sing along exists in La La Land to counter the real downturns and compromises that Mia and Sebastien are forced to make in their own relationship to achieve the success they crave. Real life isn't like the movies, basically.The problem is that the songs themselves are rather dull and uninspiring, notably the recurring 'music box-esque' piano theme which, while tender and sweet in the right moments, is very simplistic and even childish in structure, sounding curiously unlike anything Sebastien, a jazz pianist, would ever really play.The large ensemble dance numbers are only at the start of the film. Again, none of these are particularly special, though the weaving camera work in the opening traffic jam number was impressive, the songs didn't stay in my memory for very long and Mandy Moore's choreography is more of a set dressing than a feature to be wowed by. The sporadic duets between Mia and Sebastien are also weak. Their voices are thin, lacking substance and their dancing is at best high school play material, filler for the transitions. These peter out by the film's last third to the point where I wondered why they even bothered making it a musical at all. I would not be running to see this on stage in the West End.That said, as a movie experience I enjoyed La La Land. It made me smile, even giggle quite a few times, but I do feel the whimsy and nostalgia for old Hollywood is clouding people's judgment of this as a deserving Oscar winner (even though, in the end, it wasn't one).""The Artist"" this ain't.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
If only I had not just watched Singin' in the Rain,"Thought this would be a dandy New Years film. Just days before, when Debbie Reynolds passed away I spent time watching the classic dance/song numbers in Singin' in the Rain. Yes, the film's opening number was a fine homage to musicals of the golden age. Then, I could not help but compare Ryan and Emma's lack luster amateur dance efforts to the amazing talents of such as Debbie, Donald and Gene Kelly. Blah versus excellence. Next, I had to endure Ryan trying to sing, total failure. Emma a notch better but again not ready for prime time. No one left the theater humming anything close to an unforgettable tune. Time for me to again start humming Singin' in the Rain.The 'story' moved at snails pace for the most part. A major plot whole when a character makes a major, life altering decision which is totally ignored as if it never happened. Perhaps there is a missing scene on the cutting room floor since this then permitted an alternate ending which, of course, made no sense.Finally, many others are right to note the lack of chemistry between Ryan and Emma.To vote anything close to an 8.9 you need memorable songs, great chemistry, ever greater singing and dance talents plus a story that makes sense rather then contradicting itself. Sadly, I found all these qualities totally lacking.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
I don't even like musicals and I loved this,"For starters, I am not a big fan of the musical genre. I see the appeal, but usually when I watch a film with entire musical pieces, I just see it as cringe and dumb. There are some movies I really like that revolve around music that some may call a musical (I liked Whiplash, its not like the typical of school musical but some considered still) but usually I end up turning off the movie if it's too old school.This movie though was super enjoyable. The main song is still stuck in my head. The dances and moments with the music didn't feel cringe or dumb at all, and in fact were actually really fun. They never felt out of place or random, it was usually a way to show off an entire scene or tell a story in a different way.The actors, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were amazing. This is probably the best they acted in.This isn't just a ""romantic"" movie, this is a movie about people trying to follow their dreams even when things are rough. This movie is a journey, one you must sit through for the 2 hours and just have a blast through.One of my favorite movies of 2016, and definitely the best musical ever created.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
An affectionate tribute to the Hollywood musicals of decades past,"La La Land is a musical film written and directed by Damian Chazelle (Whiplash) and starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. I'll admit musicals are a guilty pleasure of mine, but it's been a while since I last saw one that I really got into. Thankfully, La La Land has done just that, with its memorable songs and clever choreography.In the city of Los Angeles, aspiring actress Mia Dolan (Emma Stone) meets aspiring Jazz pianist Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) and the two fall in love. Throughout the course of their relationship, the couple strive harder and harder to make something of their potential careers in the fast-paced and surreal city.The film plays off as an affectionate tribute to the Hollywood musicals of decades past, complete with stylish dance choreography and bombastic set pieces. Also, despite its jovial tone and brightly-coloured presentation, there are plenty of bittersweet moments that prevent the film from becoming too sappy and overly sentimental. The songs were all great and they all segued perfectly into the plot. The chemistry between both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is fantastic. Both actors seem like they were having a blast filming their dancing and singing scenes.I rate it 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

A curate's egg of a film.,"I am a great fan of musicals, I own over 700 of them on DVD and lecture on the subject all over Israel. I eagerly anticipated this film which arrived in Israel on December 16th. I am disappointed.In parts this film is good, the opening sequence on the freeway superb, but parts of the film were, simply, boringly slow. The music and songs were good but not outstandingly memorable. The ""hit"" song City of Stars was not allowed to be performed fully and the marvelous and colorful dance sequence towards the end was cut shamefully short. The jazz sequences were terrific, if you like jazz as the dialog points out.Ryan Gosling is a revelation as a singer,dancer and pianist but everyone else was average. The constant panning of the camera was a distraction but the long, continuous, single takes work very well, particularly Emma Stone's audition song. The dance sequence between the two stars into the clouds was poor, not even in the same class as as Woody Allen and Diane Keaton.The film is described by some as a tribute to Fred and Ginger. Hardly. And I wonder how many of the current reviews from such limited distribution are from actors and luvvies from la la land?Yes, this is a good film, one I might watch again but the advance hype is not supported by what I saw on screen. The audience seemed to like it, with the odd exception and, maybe, I am being too critical which is likely reflected in the ""likes"" for my review. But this is not, in my opinion, a musical that will stand the test of time as a blockbuster.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Reminded me of the Golden Age of Hollywood,"First of all, this movie is not a complete musical. There is a lot of singing and dancing but the movie has a lot of normal dialog as well. The opening scene is very neat and is basically one long shot that takes place on the LA freeway, with everybody singing and dancing. It has nothing to do with the rest of the movie though.I liked how the opening also had the ""Filmed in Cinemascope"" at the beginning. That gave you that ""old school"" feeling right away. There were many great locations in the movie that make you want to travel to LA and just hang out in jazz clubs. Speaking of Jazz Clubs, I really liked how J.K Simmons had a small role at the jazz club, considering he played a jazz instructor in WHIPLASH.I really love the chemistry between Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling). It was such a nod to the old Hollywood classics. Emma is such a wonderful actress and captivating on screen. She will probably be playing great roles for many years to come.The ending was actually very very well done and had a bittersweet twist to it. Finally, at the VERY end, they show the words ""THE END"" which also bring back great memories of movie watching days gone by.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Remarkable! One of the best experiences I've had in theaters this year,"""La La Land"" has the exuberance of ""West Side Story,"" the willpower of ""Dreamgirls"" and the pizazz of ""Grease""s romance. Writer/director Damien Chazelle who rocked our world with ""Whiplash"" a couple of years ago, has done it again. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are a movie match made in musical heaven. I seriously cannot find a single false note with ""La La Land.""The story is about Mia (Emma Stone) who is an aspiring actress, struggling from one audition to the next, her daytime job is working at a coffee shop in a studio lot where she can be near her dream. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a dedicated jazz musician struggling to make ends meet, dreaming of someday running his own jazz club. Mia and Sebastian meet and fall for each other, but they live in a city known for crushing hopes and breaking hearts. Together they continue to explore the joy and pain of pursuing their dreams.Damien Chazelle has found a way to reignite our love for Los Angeles the way ""Rebel Without a Cause"" did decades ago, in fact, much of ""La La Land"" is more or less of an homage to that James Dean classic. The colors, the look, the design, the tone, even though it's set in present day, the characters could've easily been transported from a golden age era. What an ambitious production, Chazelle's crew even literally reserved a whole freeway just for their opening scene and trust me when I say that that scene must've been worth the traffic because it's absolutely spectacular. The songs, the music, the choreography are flawless, they're on point, they're upbeat, they take you up to cloud nine. And when the rejections roll in and the characters hit rock bottom and Ryan Gosling melodiously sings his ""City Of Stars"" song, it's so tender, it becomes your only desired remedy.Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone had worked together before on ""Gangster Squad"" so you can sense that these two actors feel very comfortable in each other's company. The level of trust between them is evident. It must be like returning to a familiar place. One sequence stands out where they dance at the Griffith Park and they're so in sync, you start to wonder how many takes did it take for them to get that down pat. What's even more impressive is their abilities to play instruments and sing, even if you don't like musical, the minute you watch ""La La Land,"" you'll stand up and cheer because the things that Gosling and Stone do will blow your mind. ""La La Land"" is original, it's remarkable, it's one of the best experiences I've had in theaters this year. With this film, Chazelle has established himself as one of the greatest storytellers of our time. And the themes hit home. Pursuing your dreams does come with a cost, because it all comes down to whether or not you're willing to give it all you've got. It's so much easier to just play it safe and do regular 9 to 5 job like everybody else. Pursuing your dreams is risky, self-doubt gets to haunt you every step of the way, and failure lurks around the corner. But what's wonderful about ""La La Land"" is that it points out the importance of having someone that believes IN you, just like the way Mia and Sebastian believe in each other, the world be damned.-- Rama's Screen --",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Thoroughly enjoyable,"I can't give the film higher marks as although I enjoyed it - it was great to watch- as a musical it didn't have the power of, say, Chicago. The dance routines were mediocre. Having recently watched Astaire and Powell dance to Begin the Beguine, the routine by the two actors by the lampost was just, well, lacking. Trying to be cool with hand in trouser pocket, they didn't seem to me to be dancing, just moving. Maybe it's not a fair comparison, but if dance routines are included, they've got to be good, and memorable.Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the colour, the locations and the story. We weren't told what was going on in the story, it just evolved. The girl works in a cafe on a film production set, we see her going to rehearsals and ( despite doing well) fails to get parts. Chance meetings with the Sebastian, they talk about their aspirations, etc. etc. I saw the film with four others and they all said, what did you think of that? This isn't their usual response and they weren't smiling. I just enjoyed being entertained and watching the story unfold. The singing wasn't great, the songs not memorable and the dance routines OKish (the opening dance at the traffic jam was, er different). I think this scene was telling us that all of those drivers had dreams of fame - can't remember what the song was about though.It was enjoyable, but I didn't leave the cinema thinking I'd watched a great film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

I even bought the soundtrack right after seeing, which I've done maybe two or three times in my life. Fun fact: Ryan learned piano just for this movie, and all scenes of him playing are real. Some people may find it moves slow at times (the friend I saw it with said as much), but personally I wasn't. In addition, the end seemed a little padded, but was still fantastic.

One of The Best Movies Ever Made,"La La Land is one of the greatest movies of 2016. It has career defining performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, the highlight being Stone.

The movie is a great homage to old musicals like Signin' In The Rain and does this extremely well, opening with things like cinema scope and technicolor. In addition, the dancing has some of the best choreography for dancing in a movie since movies like Signin' in The Rain.

A Musical Masterpiece Showcasing The Beauty Of Jazz,"From the opening sequence, this film captivates the audience through the dancing and singing bringing to life the essence of the film in a couple of minutes. A broadway musical on the screen makes you feel as if you are watching this performance live, it really connects to the audience as it's full of energy and passion. It reminds the viewers of the beauty that is jazz music and reality of an actor and musicians' dream of becoming successful and ultimately making a choice of what is more important to them.Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone had a strong chemistry between them adding to the overall believability and connection to the characters. The film displays moments of comedy and changes to moments of seriousness rather smoothly. The audience feels for the characters' journey and individual growth as ""Mia"" played by Emma Stone and ""Sebastian"" played by Ryan Gosling pursue their passions for acting and music as they learn from each other who they are and what they want to become.This film is my favourite musical movie as it cleverly uses jazz music in a modern and exciting way. The cinematography of the pool scene reminded me of the party in the film ""The Great Gatsby"" with all the loud music and dancing, adding to the atmosphere of the scene in both films. I recommend this movie for those who love musicals and enjoy playing a musical instrument or just listening to songs as well as those who love acting and performing. It's perfect for the whole family and a great way to feel inspired and motivated to pursue your dreams and express creativity.This film will change the way you feel about jazz music and make you want to watch live concerts and shows. It has many lessons about the reality of wanting to become a musician or actor as it teaches you that it's all about learning to cope with rejection and to always look for opportunities and to never give up hope. One day your opportunity will come, you just have to push through the knock backs and be resilient. Problems may arise on the way as foreshadowed through the opening sequence song ""Another Day of Sun"" which talks about Mia and Sebastian's journeys' throughout the film but at the end, everything works out for the best no matter what they choose in the end. It doesn't always mean what's more important to them but what they need in that moment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Five bags of popcorn,"Powerful musicals make me feel like it's a crime to put words to them. After seeing La La Land, it was clear to me that the film was one of the best theatre experiences I will ever have.I worship the beauty of La La Land. It's all so big and beautiful. And Emma Stone is brilliant. She does the best thing an actress can do: to find a way to be the most compelling woman in the room without having to be the loudest. She conveys the most power through her subtleties, and this is partly due to her wonderful chemistry with Gosling.The humanistic wonder expressed through Gosling and Stone's eyes when they look at each other is enough to carry any movie. The music is the spirit of their romance. This is especially prevalent in their intense moments with one another, like in the Planetarium sequence. It's just as much about their faces while they dance as it is the dancing.La La Land portrays extremely vital parts of human existence that are easily forgotten about, and given towards normality, or daily life. Stone sings that ""a little bit of madness is key"" in an ode to ""the ones who dream"". This particular song makes cements the already prevalent attitude of the film, that vision, imagination, hope, endurance and love make the impossible a reality.Brutal realism, in film and real life, complements the hazy dynamics of love, making the emotion so much more powerful within the human being. The dynamic screenplay adds to the film's realism, contributing to its overall power.For example, when you see the scenes like her at his concert, like him missing her play, it's clear how much they love each other but how in order to fulfill themselves and become who they are, they need to do it separately. Then their lives took them away from each other, and she met someone else and had kidsIt all becomes clear at Seb's at the end. They still love each other but almost too much. their circumstances make it so they couldn't be together, they're too invested in each other and have to be near each other, and in their two journeys do not collide well enough to be sustainable.La La Land is a movie about love and passion, the intersection and division of both within the creative life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
You might enjoy this if you are La La,"A stone cold performance from Emma and the goose is cooked where Ryan is concerned. Any attempts to recreate the chemistry of so-called Hollywood golden classics it attempts to emulate are a weak fizz.Slow and contrived, the plot is weaker than a cup of tea made from a tenth dunk of the bag. An imminently forgettable score appears built around one pleasant enough motif but is bashed beyond compare. There is richness in the jazz that underpins it all but much like its syncopated rhythms, this one misses the beat. No more so than in the much hyped opening scene: I was hoping someone might get some road rage and move the story on.The critical hype is clearly written by those with their heads firmly placed in la la land.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

I was astonished by his grace and pure perfection as Sebastian; I mean, Ryan Gosling as a jazz musician was everything I never knew I needed. He sang, he danced, he was absolutely sublime. Like many others would say, Emma and Ryan have a chemistry that is undeniable and it's hard not to watch them together on screen. They are captivating to watch, the energy flows through them and into the audience and its really something special. John Legend was pretty excellent in a supporting role, initially it took me a second seeing him in a different capacity but he was great! Acting isn't his trade, but I liked seeing him even though I thought it was a bit brief. Having him sing in the film was a real treat for those who may not be familiar with his music. His voice is like a fine wine; like honey in your mouth – thick, rich and sweet. His addition to the cast was smart and really upped the ante musically, because John is just so supremely talented.As far as direction, Damien Chazelle was able do what so few directors can, and that is create magic on film. It's really astonishing considering the undertaking this film must've been for someone who's only directed one other feature film. LaLa Land was directed as if by a seasoned veteran, scenes were seamless and so precise, in some parts it felt like I was watching a live play. The film is the best kind of fantasy, filled with love, joy, and life. You can't help but walk away thinking about your own dreams, feeling inspired to make those dreams a reality. This film is a homage, a love song to a film genre that's been long gone and sorely missed. It reminded me of old Hollywood glamour – the sophistication and raw talent seemed to have the audience gripped from start to finish. It was refreshing and yet envelops you like a warm blanket on a chill winter's morning. It was effortless, clean and pure perfection.I did like that the film also had some clear undertones and commentary on Hollywood as well as personal growth. Without saying too much, I think that these points really rounded out the film making it very robust and multidimensional. The film was able to position itself as somewhat nostalgic while not being cliché or predictable. One of my favorite lyrics in the film is, ""madness is key to give us new colors to see,"" and this is so true and poignant when it comes to the dreamer. The dreamer is mad, considered not to be practical – similarly Steve Jobs once said, ""the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do."" Sometimes madness and genius go hand in hand, so don't fear it, embrace it; embrace the mad chaotic beauty of having big dreams, hold tightly to them and remember that its always worth the fight to make it a reality.Bottom line: LaLa Land is a must see. You must experience the songs, the dancing, the joy and happiness this film brings you. It infuses you with hope and sends you back out into the world as a dreamer. I highly suggest this film be experienced by all, it is an incredible achievement – the amout of applause at the end of the screening I saw as deafening. This is a definite Oscar contender, no question about it. Go see it! A++",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Being a fool who dreams....,"There comes to be some difficulty when creating a modern film. Certain expectations have been set, and the job of a filmmaker is to either meet or defy them. La La Land does just that, and in the most brilliant of ways. What Emma Stone and Ryan Gossling bring to the table is one of the things this film does right. Their chemistry and sense of humor play a part in why La La Land will be able to be repeatedly watched. The soundtrack gets better the more times you listen to it on Spotify, and songs will never leave your head (in the best way). The thing that absolutely stands out about La La Land, however, is its ability to display the utter truth of life...some dreams have to be postponed or completely dropped in order to make room for the others...while still delivering the message that dreaming is one of the most important aspects of life. And with all that being said, I wholeheartedly smile every time it is mentioned. La La Land will always remain near the top of my favorite motion pictures.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"Fantastic experience, a movie that defines artistic beauty","There is nothing else that could be said about it apart from what I'm going to. It is a movie of true, profound beauty, one that touches your soul and leaves you in silence and awe. And all of this is because it deals with something we all face at some point - what is right to choose in life, when our dreams also require great compromises? I truly recommend everyone to see 'La La Land', especially in a movie theatre, to discover with their own eyes the great talent of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling and the chemistry they share on the big screen. Surely, without a pair such as this one, the experience would have been much different - it is a film that relies on their performances, which are executed flawlessly from the first scene in which they appear to the very end; all of their passions, desires and conflicts are full of life. You can see it in their eyes, dance moves and gestures with each other. The cinematography is fantastic and the musical score has been part of my playlist ever since watching the movie for the first time (I couldn't resist going more than once). The costume design is superb. I hope I didn't understate the beauty of this film. But in all seriousness, if you can, please go see 'La La Land'. It is a work of art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
It feels like a bad attempt at a Disney movie...,"I watched it because it was so hyped up but personally it felt like a waste of time.It had cool shots though, which is why I kept watching till the end, 10/10 for cinematography.

A fantastic musical romance film with a so-so story?,"I really liked this movie. I found the tone pleasant from beginning to end. I found the main characters colorful, charming and very well developed. For me though, the most engaging parts of the movie were the musical numbers. The songs in the film were very well composed and had fantastic and powerful lyrics. The dancing and choreographic work were spectacular in this, not to mention the camera-work, which was interesting to say the least. The musical numbers, to me were the true highlight of this movie and I really wanted to see more of them. Unfortunately, what drags the movie down for me is the fact that I found the story only okay. While I found the musical bits amazing, I thought that the story wasn't as engaging as I thought it would be. There were some bits that felt too slow even though the pacing was pretty good. I also found the ending of the movie to be very confusing. I personally didn't find the movie amazing like many people did, only good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Here's to the Fools Who Dream,"In 2016, writer/director of Whiplash, Damien Chazelle, scored big at film festivals and theaters during the holiday season with one of the biggest hits of 2016, La La Land. Regarded as a luscious tribute to musicals of the 40s and 50s, this film has become a critical darling and audiences have warmed up to it ever since it played theatrically in December 2016. Not only that, but it broke a new record at the Golden Globes by winning almost if not all the categories, from best motion picture in the comedy or music section, to best actor and best actress, to best director, to best screenplay, etc. While the movie is still a phenomenal piece of art, it's also the perfect movie to watch on valentine's day. How is it better to watch it on that said holiday as opposed to just any other day? Well, it's quite simple really.The movie is a romantic-dramedy about two struggling artists, Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) and Mia Dolan (Emma Stone). The former is someone trying to bring traditional jazz back to the modern day crowd whereas the latter is an aspiring actress who comes close to giving up from failed audition after failed audition. After several dates and discussions about the magic of motion pictures, music, and acting, Mia is convinced to make her own play and even do more auditions, where Sebastian gets a gig with a hip-hop/jazz group that soon become a hit. The perseverance from these two can really make one root for them as their dreams are quite common to several artists who just want to entertain and do what they love. Even with countless struggles and failures, it's best to not give up, for you will still rise like Maya Angelou even when you feel like there's no point. While their relationship does have its troubles, it's meant to be a more realistic yet intriguing approach to two artists learning about each other. Their passions are what really give the movie its heart and soul, both in style and in substance. The aspiring musician and aspiring actress may have different views of entertainment, but they're still artists who care about making a difference nonetheless.Mia and Sebastian have a lot of chemistry together; while Mia is more into theater and acting than music or jazz, Sebastian shows her how jazz musicians speak thru their instruments whether it be from their practice or improvised performances. When Mia gives Sebastian a tour of Hollywood movie sets, that's where they begin to express their passions to each other and begin to warm up as a couple. Sebastian advises Mia to make her own play, but that doesn't mean he can be there with his fame and music gigs. The real emotional side of the film lies in the conflicts between their passions. Due to their passions being different, their moments of glory sadly intertwine their relationship and it even toggles their hopes for getting their own careers in the first place.As my 12th grade creative writing teacher once said, ""As old fantasy Hollywood musical as it seems, it's also realistic in it's portrayal; it doesn't always work out"". That's why the emotions of the movie really pay off, it deals with something many people may go through. Just because one has a decent career going for them doesn't mean they can always be with their loved ones, and that's where the realism in the romance angle pays off. Love is not like a Disney picture as it's more complicated to sustain for some, but the heart from both characters are still there, and caring is what got them their dreams in the first place.And then there's the film's tribute to classic jazz, theater drama and Broadway, and musicals of the 40s and 50s. The musical numbers were composed by the film's composer, Justin Hurwitz, with lyrics written by musical theater composing team, Pasek and Paul, and they really understand the beauty and amazement of Broadway and motion picture musicals. The musical numbers from Another Day of Sun, to Someone in the Crowd, to the Oscar winning City of Stars bring out the movie its upbeat, whimsical, and timeless feel that will make this film worth being up there with classics like Singin' in the Rain and West Side Story that would really make people dance in their seats. The Fools Who Dream really creates an emotional and character driven arch for Mia as well.The singing from Gosling and Stone is nothing fantastic at first, especially with the song A Lovely Night, but it warms up as the film goes on, and it fits as they build up to persevere in their dreams and to support one another. The Planetarium segment is pure visual delight and is ""pretty referential by trying hard to refer back to those old Hollywood films"" stated creative writing teacher. But the one musical number that really shines throughout the continuation of the film is Mia and Sebastian's Theme, as it progresses the optimistic tone of the film while giving Ryan Gosling a real showcase of his piano talents. Don't be surprised if you find a lot to enjoy in terms of the musical numbers, let alone dancing to them.But I think the main reason this film is the perfect film to watch on valentine's day is not only because it's a love story, but it's a more optimistic and hopeful one. Since this film is about two rising entertainers who despite constant struggles and dilemmas still make it big one way or another, it ends up being quite relatable to anyone who started off struggling at the bottom before making it to the top. The determination and bravery Mia and Sebastian have really sells the movie, and the theme of never giving up and always finding support really pays off. Support is the best thing anybody can use when trying to make a name for themselves, and that's why it's best to not look down upon your closest friends when they help you make it somewhere, everything happens for a reason. And that's why the film feels like such a love letter, it says that you can still make a living out of whatever passion you have just as long as you don't forget about the ones that helped you get there. Complete with a special ending of realization and wonderment at the end that won't be spoiled, take it upon yourself to view this optimistic and bright feature with your soul mate anytime you choose.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"Nice performances from the leads, and generally good fun.","I had a bit of a dilemma at the cinema last week ... go and see Felicity Jones get ill and die in A Monster Calls, or go for some escapist nonsense instead. It was a grey miserable January day, so La La Land won. It was pretty enjoyable, too. Ryan Gosling did a great job of being, e, Ryan Gosling pianist / keyboard player (which is pretty cool in itself)... and Emma Stone was absolutely fantastic as his love interest. One of her audition scenes reminded me of the incredibly powerful audition Naomi Watts does in Mulholland Drive, and that might not be a co-incidence judging from La La Land's locations. Ultimately a musical is going to stand or fall on the quality of its songs, and I'm not sure these will pass the test of time... but the whole movie was well done and a good romantic night out - unless you go along with someone you are not totally sure you want to spend the rest of your life with.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Good not great,"I just can't begin to understand the irrational hype over this movie. It is good. It's very beautifully filmed and edited, and has a intriguing, although well-worn story line. It boasts measured and tasteful acting as well as attractive actors, of course. It even features some really awesome jazz. But that's about where it ends. Shouldn't a musical include some actual song and dance talent? The dancing is, well, pedestrian. The singing ranges from decent to awful. It's difficult to understand who thought it was a good idea to cast Ryan Gosling in a singing role. It's more painful to listen to than Pierce Brosnan in Mamma Mia. La La Land will probably win lots more awards, I just wish someone would explain to me why.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

The movie revolves around Mia, a coffee shop barista who aspires to be an actress, and Sebastian, a dedicated jazz musician, trying to make ends meet while pursuing their dreams in a city known for destroying hopes and breaking hearts. With modern day L.A. as the backdrop, this musical about everyday life explores what is more important: a once-in-a-lifetime love or the spotlight. Everything in this movie is perfect.

An all time classic musical,"This is like a great 50's MGM musical was made in 2016 and I simply cannot understand how anyone would dislike the film. It has everything a musical should have. There's the two appealing and darling lovebirds to follow. Striking and visual pleasant colors and direction that make the film a cinematic experience from beginning to end. And the score is beltable, lush and with with iconic songs. This is like the platonic ideal of movie musicals.Best of all the script has a relative sophistication to it; there's a troubling ambiguity about how the film feels about Seb and him being way to into jazz. In fact the script, more or less, acknowledges that he is a bit a prig. Indeed the film leaves the distinct impression that the romance was sacrificed on the alter of personal ambition. It is annoying how the Oscar race simplified this film.In the end this is one of the great musicals.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Very enjoyable but the end left me a bit flat,"I built up a high level of anticipation in seeing this film. I enjoy both Ryan G and Emma S as actors and like music. The high ratings on IMDb also added to the anticipation. I found myself quite engrossed in the story and where it was going. It was filled with the day to day ups and downs of life and the beauty of aspiring to dreams and love. I play the piano and enjoy Jazz and dancing so appreciated the melodic intertwining of the music through the story line. Both main actors did a good job with the dancing and singing given they are not professionals in these areas. As much as I enjoyed the film, I found myself a bit flat at the end as I didn't interpret the ending as a joyous one unlike other reviewers that said it was inspiring and a feel good ending. This was not the case for me. I felt the ending could have been done much better and there was too much of a gap in the story that was covered in the last 15 or so mins. I enjoyed the singing, dancing, story and overall cinematography, the movie had a great realistic emotional romantic feel to it. Just felt a bit let down at the end though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Melody,"When you look at Musicals, as a genre, the train of thought is immediately followed by a cheesy and cheeky end, that you might've seen on any other film. This doesn't have any, this does however contradict logic a couple of times, but movie is meant not to be perfect, but to encourage perfectness. 
I despise Musicals, but now after watching this, I must refute from my claim, partially. This movie has a charm, an aura, beautiful colors, and beguiling melody. 
Jazz, is jazzing throughout the movie, the reverberations, the claps, the beats, the shakes, the chords all blend into unison to concieve a piece as great as this. 
Audio though was a little brittle (don't know if it's universal, or for the theatre I watched in).

Prepare to be DISAPPOINTED!  La La Land or Blaah Blaah Bland?,"We should give credit when it's due, but not when it doesn't deserve it. Damien Chazelle did an excellent job in writing and directing the movie Whiplash in 2014, but not so with La La Land in 2016.This latest film was utter garbage and deserves less than a 1/10.

It needed much more substance and quality.I will never trust movie reviews ever again. How this got so many nominations blows mind!

"Majestic, enchanting and delightful... and that's an understatement.","La La Land starts off with an odd piece- imagine the busiest highway in your city suddenly turning into a sing-along, with everyone dancing outside of their cars. Shortly after that, it bursts into a classic, magical film laced with love, the freight of dreams, and the will to not give up on them.I was a little bit skeptical at first not having been a huge fan of musicals in the past-- but I was very wrong. It's more of a movie then a musical. The musical, as I think about it, is just the cherry on top of an already brilliant script. La La Land is filled with those simultaneous conflicts between dreams and reality-- hence the singing, and the musical aspect of the film. This makes it for the dreamers and the realists alike.Do you want to make your dreams come true, but you're dealing with some internal conflicts? Then this movie is for you.

La La Land Loveliness,"La La Land is the type of movie I hate starting to watch. It's not because I hate movie musicals; quite the opposite in fact. What I dislike intensely is those films that use the old Hollywood movie genres, like those old screwball comedies or the old musicals as a basis and then proceed to get them wrong (Down With Love, anyone?). That's exactly what I thought would happen with this movie. I couldn't have been more wrong.The film, as well as being visually stunning, is full of characters that you want to spend time with, especially that of Emma Stone. Her character, Mia, is played fantastically. To my mind, this performance from Stone ranks with her best. That's not to say that Ryan Gosling isn't also good, because he is.The songs, if not completely in the style of the old Hollywood musicals, given the film's contemporary setting, stay true to their essence, and the story is engaging too. Much like Pirates of the Caribbean and The Artist breathed life into long-dead genres, I think La La Land will give those people who don't really give movie musicals a second glance a new appreciation.La La Land is a delightful modern movie musical, and I'm sorry I ever doubted it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
should have won best picture,"Everything about this movie is remarkable. From opening number (probably one of my favorite scenes ever) to the final montage (again, probably one of my favorite scenes ever), La La Land is a mesmerizing story about following your dreams. The film starts with an energetic, catchy, and beautifully choreographed tune called ""Another Day of Sun"" which really has nothing to do with the story, but sets up the mood and the context. From there, we follow two main characters as they pursue their dreams together. For Seb, a jazz musician. For Mia, an actress.La La Land's most notable features are the music, colors, choreography, and cinematography. The music, written by Justin Hurwitz, perfectly fits and forms the mood of every scene. I really have no complaints about any of the songs. There are so many different hues of colors, and each scene seems to have a different color scheme. I don't know too much about dancing, but to the extent of my knowledge the choreography is brilliant and entertaining (though no comparison to Gene Kelly). The cinematography strategically combines elements of both a Golden Era masterpiece and a stage play, while also providing space to showcase the colors and music.The actors try hard, but to be honest, I personally don't like any of the actors in this. Other than my personal distaste of casting, I have no complaints of La La Land. It's a visual and musical masterpiece that I plan to watch many more times.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Once Upon A Time In (And Around) Los Angeles,"There are various kinds of reality about Los Angeles and its surrounding environs. One is the decades-long reputation it has of making dreams come true. Another, on the opposite end of the spectrum, is the equally long reputation it has of destroying those dreams. And still another is one where every wacky thing that can happen to any part of the human race, good or bad, does indeed happen: televised high-speed car chases; firestorms fueled by Santa Ana winds; incredible urban flooding; earthquakes; ethnic gang murders; riots; entertainment scandals (especially the latter, because...well, there's Hollywood). But in 2016, a totally unusual film came out that tried (and in many ways succeeded) in restoring a fair amount, if not all, of the reputation that L.A. has of being a proud metropolis. That film was LA LA LAND, a film that became one of the highest grossing musicals in Hollywood history and won a staggering six Oscars.Beginning with one of the most elaborate opening musical numbers ever staged for any film, done on location at the interchange of I-105 and I-110, the film charts an aspiring jazz pianist (Ryan Gosling) who finds his career going nowhere, forced as he is to find gigs in dingy bars and clubs in and around L.A., and being prodded by a friend (John Legend) to adjust to the changing times of the jazz genre. And then there is an aspiring actress (Emma Stone) who, in-between casting auditions that also go nowhere, is serving her time out as a barrista to the stars. No one would think that these two disparate souls with dreams that are either being stalled or going in reverse could possibly meet, let alone fall in love. But this being Los Angeles in general, and Hollywood specifically, it does indeed happen.Of course, nothing ever happens without some kinks. Even as Gosling and Stone find themselves falling in love, they also see their careers finally starting to rise, which in turn leads to their budding romance undergoing as much strain as one of the region's many earthquake faults. Stone is initially not even remotely fond of the jazz music that Gosling parlays his trade in; and Gosling is himself cynical of the acting business and even the approach of Angelinos to life in general (""they worship everything, and they value NOTHING""). Still, in between these foibles and acts of dissolution and disillusionment, both Gosling and Stone engage in wily banter and some of the most incredible musical numbers seen in any Hollywood film (outside of animated movies) for decades, including the wish-fulfilling ""City Of Stars"".Damien Chazelle, who wrote and directed the 2014 Oscar-winning drama WHIPLASH, was taking a sizeable risk in making LA LA LAND. He clearly wanted to bring about in the late part of the second decade of the 21st century the same kinds of emotions that one felt in past musicals like SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, WEST SIDE STORY, and CABARET, but with something wholly original. But even with more recent box office hits like CHICAGO and DREAMGIRLS, musicals are as expensive to pull off as almost any other kind of film except for comic-book CGI extravaganzas; and some of the biggest ones, even if in the distant past, have been tremendous box office disasters. What Chazelle had going for him here, fortunately, were two extremely appealing leads in Gosling and Stone, as well as supporting turns from Legend, a devotee of old-school R&B and jazz music, and J.K. Simmons (who plays Gosling's boss, and who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in WHIPLASH). And even more to the point, Los Angeles and its satellite cities and landmarks serve as supporting characters themselves: the Hermosa Beach pier; the Griffith Observatory; the Rialto Theater in South Pasadena; the Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood; the Colorado Street Bridge in Pasadena; and the aforementioned I-105/I-110 interchange in South Los Angeles.Although it is at times a bit emotionally distant, LA LA LAND is still an entirely original musical in which the world, or at least L.A. itself, is the stage and the characters and the region itself all play their parts. This is never the easiest thing to pull off; but Chazelle and company managed to do it, and do it like gangbusters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Amusing but not great..,"A lot of reviews on IMDb thought that this movie deserved a 1/10, and more considered it a great one. And while it seems that this movie is having an undeserved rating, I wouldn't consider it really a bad one. In fact, I had fun watching it and though it is a bit long for its content, it is nevertheless amusing.Yes, movies are subjective.. but still one can judge a movie for what it has got to offer.. especially for movie lovers a set of artistic principles can be laid.I'll be quick on its positive aspects: The music (not the dancing and singing) is good. The plot is entertaining.. some of the scenes (especially between Stones and Gosling) are innovative, and others attempted to revive the classics. Chazelle also put a great deal of effort with the camera-work.Well for the negative side, the singing and dancing were not so good.. and for a musical this is really important. Some said that it was better that the singing was modest, for it appeals more to the characters. But really, a musical should introduce something beautiful for the viewer to get emotionally attached and it won't seem abnormal.. it is a musical after all. Look at West Side Story (1961) or Singin' in the Rain (1952); every song is memorable.. well and that is another issue with La La Land. I forgot the songs the minute the movie ended.The characters also seemed a bit shallow. Gosling's character was a bit deeper than Stone's, but his acting was bad. Emma made a good effort in acting to enhance her character.The script also seemed of little depth. So it is about following your dreams (an idea now overused) and the conflicts one may encounter with the person he/she loves.. and while there is nothing indeed special about this, I have to say that the execution makes it somehow dull. The dialogue is bluntly thrown at us with nothing to take hold of. At some point in the movie I remembered ""In the Mood for Love (2000); a drama/romance movie that I found much deeper and better executed.I won't say anything about the movie's last 15 or 20 minutes that would spoil the movie for you.. but I'd like to point out that it is really inconsistent with the rest of the movie. I think many had the same feeling.. and the way the movie neglected some of the details was not helpful at all.All in all, ""La La Land"" is a descent movie and a fun to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Romantic and musical masterpiece!,"This movie is something extraordinary. I enjoyed every scene in this movie. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone make the perfect duo and seeing them together on screen is very heart touching. It is like the two stars were made for each other. The movie is ideal because of their acting, singing, dancing, and just them being in love with each other. I think that this movie is one of the 21st century's hits. The movie is appropriate for everyone, and you can enjoy it, watching and alone and with friends. If you ever want to watch a romantic and musical masterpiece, then this movie is for you!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Review,"La La Land is a movie by Damien Chazelle which brings back together with old musicals like Singin' in the Rain, Broadway Melody, shall we Dance and much more. Overall it is a movie about movies. The whole movie plot is about potential but struggling actress Mia who thought that she can be an actor because her aunt showed her some ""Casablanca"" posters when she was younger and jazz pianist Sebastian who is currently stuck with the idea of bringing back the glory of jazz like before. The beginning of the movie took my breath away, even though I am not a big fan of the musicals, but that bridge scene was stunning. Later, the whole plot of the movie was about following struggling lives of actors until their paths came across, and then guess what, they fall in love, nothing to be surprised for. Later, they started to support each other towards their life dreams, until Mia dumps Sebastian because he was going for guaranteed success instead of opening jazz bar. Mia went home to her parents and giving up on her dream to become actress until Sebastian comes and saves the day by persuading Mia to go to this promising audition, and then something happened that I didn't even expect to happen, they both went separate ways, until they met again in future Mia as successful actress with family and Sebastian with this dream achieved to open successful jazz bar. That scene was interesting because I didn't even expect it and it kept the dose of reality, it was a happy ending but not as usually one. This film had some interesting moments from technical / shooting aspect. The cinematography is good and the movie is visually perfect, but what can you expect from the movie with more than 30 million dollars budget. I really liked that the movie was shot in the way that somehow it reminds you of old days, because of the visuals you could say that, it is only because of the usage of modern technologies like iPhone, new cards etc. it is obvious that is modern age. This movie includes one interesting scene that can be referenced as slight return of Mise en scène, scene where Mia and Sebastian were on their first date, there were in cinema watching ""Rebel Without a Cause"", the situation between them were starting to get bit more serious until the screen goes black because of technical issues, and then everything stops. The lighting and colors were playing a huge roll in the movie, colors were crucial in displaying the current emotions. The blue color was used a lot, it surrounded Mia few times, for example, the moment when Sebastian had the first concert with a bend, she also had a blue dress at the party, and the city was shining blue after she left the party. The yellow played a huge role because it symbolized the change ahead. Like the moment when Mia and Sebastian danced after party, Mia's dress was yellow and before that, they were in not so friendly relation but after the dance, they looked like more than some friends. Also, the moment when they were on dinner they both were bathed in yellow color while the background was green in the end that scene resulted with the possible break up. I really liked the moment where they shot the 360-degree scene with Mia singing the song, it looked like she is alone in her own universe telling the tale about her struggling to reach the stars. From the analytical aspect, the movie is decent but I have expected more. The story was so basic that even clichés had clichés, even though I was really surprised by ending it caught me off guard, there was that dose of reality trough whole movie that I really liked.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Modern and Stylish,"The first half of the movie was boring and I feel like I'm watching a teen movie, but the second half became more interesting as it portrayed the challenges of their life.The description and music choices in this movie were very nice and stylish.Just one line ""I don't like Jazz"" is too impolite and disrespectful. That line was too strong to accept it. I was disappointed.It was not a happy ending, but it was not gloomy and full of hope.Emma Stone has a talent for acting and is very expressive. I think she is suited for the suspense and thriller genre than this kind of musical movie. I was disappointed with the Disney movie ""Cruella"" because it was too similar to ""The Devil Wears Prada"". She couldn't bring out the best performance in this movie either. I would like to see her play a more serious role.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
So so,"I dragged my gf to watch this film, and both of us left feeling a bit 'so what...' I can't critisise a film because they do great great marketing, but the Oscar nominations obviously mean something and I cannot see why the committee thinks so highly of it. I was thinking about films to compare it with and the nearest was Pretty Woman which is head and shoulders better. So why? The two leads showed very little chemistry between them, both of them seemingly only half-interested in life; drifting from scene to scene. The filming has a very studio-lot feel about it, slightly artificial and cartoonish. (I'm sure that's what they wanted, it just seemed weak.) And the music has virtually no memorable numbers.

Musical I enjoyed!?!,Never been a fan of the genre Musical. If you watched 'Paint your wagon' or 'Cat Balloo' you will understand why. In my view only 'Singing in the rain' was an acceptable musical.

It's because of the magic rhythm and photography that I actually enjoyed the musical parts that I would normally find boring and unnecessary interfering with the plot development.

THE MOST WONDERFUL MOVIE OF ALL TIMES,"Please don't listen to the ones who tell you that this is not worth It. This movie literally changed my life!

A lively supercut of Classic musicals,"It's been decades since a studio produced the kind of colorful musical fantasy that ""La La Land"" so affectionately salutes, but writer-director Damien Chazelle is the guy who done the job perfectly. It is high-concept pastiche, filled with beautiful people, beautiful movement, and beautiful colors. At its best, ""La La Land"" probes the irony of its existence, celebrating the greatness of a bygone era in the context of changing times. As a drama, this is less nourishing than the heritage it pays tribute to. But for Chazelle, the story is just a slight rib around which he builds a modern rhapsody. So in spite of its flaws, La La Land has moments of pleasure and satisfaction that are worth the price of admission. It's not that it's a bad movie; it's just not an outstanding entertainment, the way great movies (especially musicals) should be. I go with 3.5/5 for the musical drama by Damien Chazelle and I do think that it is the frontrunner for the Oscars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Surprisingly okay to watch,"This is definitely not a movie that I would have chosen to watch all by myself which perhaps explain why I thought it was just surprisingly okay to watch. However my girlfriend absolutely wanted to watch it so I got it. As it turned out my girlfriend had only gone by the number of Oscars and not really looked up what kind of movie it actually was so in the end I was enjoying the movie a lot more than she did.This movie is pretty much a quite classical Hollywood musical with a non too original story, nice music and dancing. In addition the cinematography is simply excellent. This is the strong point of this movie. The rest of the movie is of lesser interest to me but the cinematography is really, really good. The scene, pictured on the movie poster, were Mia and Sebastian dances and everything in the scene are dark blue tones except Mia's bright yellow dress is so simple and yet so beautiful.Everything else about this movie isokay. Okay acting, okay story etc. As I wrote before this is really not my kind of movie so forgive me for not being overly enthusiastic. I am sure those into these kind of movies cannot understand how anyone can give it less than a full set of stars but hey, different tastes and all that.I cannot make up my mind about ending. On one hand I am a sucker for happy endings which this one falls a wee bit short on. On the other hand I have to commend the writer/director for not taking the path of least resistance and instead putting together something a wee bit different.I did feel that a part of the movie was missing though. I would have liked to see the parts where Mia and Sebastian actually fulfilled their respective dreams. Jumping fast forward to the ending like the movie did felt a bit like they either ran out of money or they manage to misplace half the story!Anyway, I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Magical!,"La La Land is a magical film with fantastic performances, incredible music, and perfect directing. Damien Chazelle has already become one of my favorite directors and this is only his second picture.

"Very Old School, Not Racists(that is ridiculous!), Not for Those Who Don't Like the Feel of Old Movies or Do Not Like Watching Musicals or 1950's Films.","Thank you to all the blindly biased negative votes given because I speak the truth. The unnecessary negative votes point as to why this review's point of view is a much needed one in a culture hellbent on insulting anyone whom does not share your viewpoint, even when those attacking you are objectively wrong and hating those blindly whom disagree with your ""enlightened"" viewpoint, that's what real bigotry is, blind hatred, if you hate my review or this movie for the reasons just stated, that is the true bigotry, and you need to get a reality check. Get out of the cultural idiocy and stop being so biased and calling it 'inclusivity', I call BS on those whom criticize this movie for being rascist when it is obviously objectively NOT.I am glad I read the negative reviews because I think they actually made me like this movie more, as most of the insults were ridiculous, and missed the point. The most ludicrous being that because it is led by attractive white people that it makes it racist... In fact criticizing a film for not having 'enough' of a certain race, is actually racist, as it is a biased based on skin color, newsflash, that's what racism is! FYI people, if I apply that to ""The Whiz"", ""The Color Purple"", or even ""Hamilton"" those would be racist because they exclude white people either altogether, or have only have a few cast members that are white. It goes both ways, racism is not exclusive to a certain skin color(BTW, I like ""The Whiz"", ""Hamilton"", and ""The Color Purple"" despite their flaws). However, neither of those are racist and neither is ""Lala Land"", yes, it does harken back to the golden age of musicals, only with less musical numbers. Lala Land has many black cast members and it lovingly dedicates a large portion of their film to Jazz, which was started by black people, and it lingers on jazz players (which outside of the male protagonist are black), and definitely puts them in a very very high regard.My only caveat is definitely that it needed more musical numbers, I read an interview with the composer and he said there were many left out of the film, so if this gets transferred to Broadway as there are talks of, we'll hear them, but I do wish more of them were actually in the film. One main theme runs through the films, but if anyone is familiar with the older films which this pays homage to, particularly 1950's movies, this is not uncommon, I think of ""An Affair to Remember"" where the main song for that is played or sung at least 4-5 times throughout, and is integral to the story, as is the main theme that is played or sung throughout ""Lala Land"", it was fitting and appropriate, especially because the main character is a Piano Player and a Songwriter!This film very much pays homage to musicians and the musical process (I write songs myself, and also used to act a good deal) and I felt, portrayed what it is like to be a musician who is just trying to get by, but also has a bigger dream, and how that process plays out. The acting side, with the auditions very much captured those feelings of the highs and lows of auditions and why being an actor is not always fun and games, unless you actually make it, but it is hard work in the process, and often degrading(I have done numerous singing and acting auditions over the last 15yrs).The singing was not at all bad, Ryan Gosling sang very well within his range, if you want bad singing go watch Vanessa Redgrave and Richard Harris in ""Camelot"" or Pierce Brosnon in ""Mamma Mia!"", all phenomenal actors, but terrible singers! Ryan Gosling has limited range, but he he used it very well. Emma Stone's singing was very girly and pretty, a bit too airy at times, but I really enjoyed her solo song towards the end where she finally shows her real chops, she has a very fine voice indeed. No, the dancing is not plentiful, but it is well done. While I wish there was more tap dancing, I am also a tap dancer, I enjoyed what they did have, although I would have liked it if they were stronger dancers, I just appreciate that it was well-done enough and that they got actors who were fairly competent and at least had rhythm.The Cinematography was beautiful, the splashy colors were a lot of fun, I loved the bright color palette, which also hearkens back to the days of Technicolor, very much like classic musicals such as ""Hello Dolly"" or ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" or even ""Westside Story"", most pre-1970's musicals actually. There were many creative uses of the camera, a lot of blurry shorts to make focal points clearer, it was very creative.While it is not perfect film, as I said, I wish there were more songs and dancing, I truly felt it captured the lost feeling from the great musicals of the past, and I really hope this does what Moulin Rouge should have done in 2001, fully reignite the modern movie musical as a monetary force. When I left the theater, I was humming the song, and I still have the song that Ryan Gosling's character plays with the ""jazz"" band he joins and plays a few times, it is a great song. All of the songs were very beautiful, and well-written. By the way, I cannot think of many musicals I actually remember the songs to after only seeing it once if I never heard the songs before, that didn't use pop songs as their score. I can only think of one, and that is ""On My Own"" from Les Mis, I had never heard that song before and it stuck in my head, but no other song, from that 30 plus songbook did I remember that I had not already heard, but they were still great songs! I can say the same for, and don't laugh, ""Repo! The Genetic Opera"", great cult film, and has great music, but not extremely catchy. Not all music, including musicals, is extremely ingratiating the first time you hear it. I don't remember any of the songs from ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" or ""Hello Dolly"" the first time I heard them, they took time to sink in.I still feel really good from watching ""Lala Land"" the next day, it made both me and my husband giddy after watching it, and the whole theater clapped after it was over. That may not be your experience, it seems to be polarizing, but it is not because it is bad film, it is a great film, it may just not be to your personal taste.God Bless ~Amy",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
More visual than aural,"The City of Angels gets a luscious, dream-like rendering in Damian Chazelle's muscial 'La La Land', as does the very idea of the Hollywood dream itself. The aesthetics are lovely, and while no account of the life of a wannabe actress will ever compare to that of 'Mullholldand Dr.', rarely has a movie made better use of southern Californian skies. The film's essential cosiness is epitomised by the fact that an in-film character ridicules the idea that an affection for 1950s jazz makes a contemporary figure a radical artist, but the narrative embraces the thought nonetheless: true radical art discomfits, which 'La La Land' does not. As a cinematic musical, it lacks the immediacy of spectacle that a live performance provides, and it doesn't help that the stars don't exactly have strong voices. In fact, after an opening section dominated by song, there are fewer numbers as the story continues, at relatively little cost: the strength of this film is more visual than aural.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
A Beautiful Film.,"LA LA LAND is wonderful, even for those who aren't fans of musicals. If you like good filmmaking and movies in general, this is a must-see. Definitely deserving of all the Oscars it received. The songs are all quite catchy, and I had a couple stuck in my head after watching. The cinematography is amazing; the film is incredibly colorful and a true pleasure to look at. There are many, many beautifully-framed shots with Los Angeles (obviously) serving as the backdrop and sometimes as the focus. The movie is definitely an ode to the classic techniques of Old Hollywood, to Los Angeles, and to the many dreamers who have and still do call it home. Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance, and has excellent chemistry with Ryan Gosling, who is also very, very good. The script is very sharp, well-written, and witty. Stone and Gosling bring it all to life with very convincing and moving efforts. Good singing and dancing, as well. All in all, this will likely go down as an all-time classic of the musical genre. Go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Lala indeed,"The opening scene features a women singing to the camera whilst sitting in a traffic jam, however it really looks as though she is miming which in a way is quite fitting because after all the film is called lala land and in many ways the makers of this one had carte blanche when it came to putting it together. The best thing beside the walking baselines in the soundtrack are probably the references to the 1950s Hollywood cinema as the whole spectacle is very much a self addressed cinematic love letter. The aesthetic is pleasing, but this is all form and no substance, if you want to see something truly unoriginal then you should give this a try. Really this is like watching a computer game trailer for a classic movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"""West Side Story""","While all musicals since ""West Side Story"" are, by definition, flawed and therefore redundant, this one really works. Starting with a great number in Los Angeles traffic, it also helps that there's plenty of room for conversation between songs, and both are well-written. Also, there are some pretty neat visual tricks, especially in the final act, which even comes with a little twist at the end. It's pretty sweet, entertaining and, most importantly, well acted. A real treat.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
A bit like Marmite,La La Land is a tough one to review especially when you take into account the sheer number of prestigious awards it received. The reason i say this film is like Marmite is because you'll either finish watching it loving the style and story or you'll feel let down. I personally believed the hype going in and because i didn't fall in love with the music and the characters it was very hard to see it in the way so many other do. The reason i have rated it a 6 is because there is no denying how impressive the style of the film is and how good the performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are.

All the hype had me fooled,"My summary basically says it all. I had so been looking forward to seeing this movie particularly as l love musicals - but am sad to say that I was hugely disappointed. It started brightly enough with the traffic jam dance scene - but from there on in it was all downhill for me. I felt the whole film was terribly disjointed and it felt like they were trying too hard to recreate the magical musicals of years gone by. The singing was poor - and the 'dancing' - if you could call it that - equally uninspiring. Some reviewers have even gushed about this being one of the 'greatest musicals' of all-time. What?? Have they never seen West Side Story, Grease, or any of the old Hollywood greats? Obviously no, otherwise they would never have made such a stupid statement.

Whimsical Wonderland,"A whimsical show of dance, song and colour will whisk you away into a jazzy fairytale that you simply cannot afford to miss. The 2016 film by Damien Chazelle entitled La La Land, features Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) as the sensational duo that tell the tale of an aspiring actress and a passionate pianist in pursuit of their dreams, and only end up achieving them by way of carefully composed choreography and perfectly penned lyrics.These two starving artists meet, originally out of hatred for each other, on a congested stretch of highway that catches them both in a sour mood during their morning commute. From this point onwards an unexpected romance is slowly curated beneath the shadow of the Hollywood sign that towers over their home town, as both Mia and Sebastian spend all of their spare time outside of their crummy jobs playing small gigs or auditioning for minor roles, in hopes of catching their big breaks.The actors, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have an undeniable chemistry that breaches the realms of the screen and enters the hearts of the audience. Emma Stone does an impeccable job of acting the role of an actress; a role that could be considered strange because it is a role that she, herself, would have been in at the beginning of her own career. And Ryan Gosling's passionate performance is enough convert us all into a lover of the soulful jazz scene that his character so desperately wants to become a part of.The score of this film will delight your ears, the colourful costumes will entice your eyes and the overall storyline will run chills down your spine. This is a film that presents the ability to engage all of your senses, and if you feel at all lost in the pursuit of your own dream, I strongly suggest you go watch this film as soon as humanly possible. I can guarantee it will reignite the spark within you and have you dancing with anticipation to follow your dreams as soon as the end credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

I am an avid film goer and consider that I have enough musical knowledge, coming from a musical background, to give such judgments.

(pardon the reference - it seemed in keeping)Equally bad, there are no songs of any worth in the whole movie.The lead actor is a jazz purist who is willing to put put his life in turmoil to live out his dream of playing real jazz. Instead, everyone around him plays excellent jazz, and he plays nothing but a very undernourished pop song.On a positive note, the opening scene was a gas. Superficial, yes, but really fun and impressive with its long tracking shot. It gave me hope for the rest of the movie, but that was the end of anything of any worth.The complete split of opinion between this being a great movie, and it being a very ordinary one is bizarre. Best Picture? Really? Have people not been going to anything else this year. There have been some absolutely wonderful movies this year.I do not understand at all. Perhaps it is because I love musicals and watch them a lot that I have something to compare it to. I don't know. But I have never been more confused.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

A memorable and fantastic musical masterpiece that pays homage to the classic musicals of old while standing out as unique and making as fresh and new,"As much as Damien Chazelle has impressed everyone with his riveting and compelling direction from Whiplash, it shows that he delivers an authentic, dazzling, compelling and outstanding musical masterpiece that delivers with a heart, depth, and soul. From a brilliant screenplay that resonates everyone with the theme of passion, love, dreams, and inspiration that forms an intimate connection in real life; the powerful acting and its performances, the astonishing and sensible direction until the memorable musical score and pieces, La La Land is truly the embodiment of a classic cinema that nails its perfection from start to finish.Even the memorable, amazing and wonderful performances of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling as well a perfect chemistry, a magnificent choreography and its gorgeous costume and production designs as well a breathtaking and sumptuous cinematography, brilliant editing, and a refreshing and touching musical score by Justin Hurwitz and its catchy musical songs perfectly composed by Pasek & Paul duo makes the experience of seeing La La Land a nostalgic experience, a feast for the eyes and a pleasurable hearing to the ears.While La La Land draws its inspiration and homages to the classic Hollywood musicals of old, it stands out as a unique musical while making the musical film genre revitalized as fresh and new that also helps inspire other modern-day musical films for years to come and making La La Land as a modern classic for all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Dreamy and Lovely and Forgettable,"La La Land is a beautifully made love story musical, and very much a celebration of the classic musicals from a bygone era.Our two main characters are Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling).Mia is an aspiring actress who dreams of silver screen stardom while suffering repeated rejection at auditions. Sebastian is frustrated Jazz pianist forced to put up with bit-part opportunities, either solo or as a band member, while he dreams of opening his own Jazz Club.Both actors perform their roles well - whether speaking, dancing or playing - and that all important chemistry so essential to a good love story is certainly there in this film.Will each realise their ambitions? Will they fall in love and live happily ever after? These are the two simple questions at the heart of this warm and colourful film.Though beautifully made and very pleasant on the eye, La La Land never really took off for me. There simply wasn't the emotional pull to care overly about the characters, or the hoped for variety and mastery of musical set pieces. In fact, too much of the music was a repeat of what had gone before and my hunch is that no songs from this film will become engrained classics like those of old. I just wanted more . . . I was waiting for lift off and it never arrived.Hats off to all involved for departing from the violent norms of so many modern day blockbuster films. They've made us a charming, sweet and dreamy movie. It might fall short in some respects, but it's still nice to see.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Superficial charm,"Usually, musicals are about a boy, a girl, a bunch of good songs and some dancing. I am not a big fan of the genre, but I definitely prefer any Astaire-Rogers movie than later productions with loud, long songs and too much dancing (anything with Gene Kelly).Therefore, the first time I saw it I enjoyed La La Land. It has a very simple plot, some pleasant songs, among which the great ""City of stars"" and most of the dance numbers are not overdone - apart from the first one, of course. At a second viewing the music didn't seem that great and in fact there were only two modestly successful songs and the rest was totally forgotten.Also, watching it a second time, I noticed how annoyingly arrogant the Mia character is. The scene with Seb at dinner is a perfect example of how narcissistic and detached from reality she is. Mia saying ""not to care about what people think"" and accusing Seb to sell out is absurd. As performers, they should care a lot about pleasing people. While integrity is appreciated, self-absorption not so much....Also, she allegedly would not have had time to pursue her career AND the love story with Seb, but in five years she found the time to have another relationship AND a baby. Doesn't that takes time too?And why not follow Mia and her successful love story along with her successful career? Too corny?I usually do not like much Gosling, but he was better than Stone.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

I was blown away by this film,"La La Land written and directed by Damien Chazelle was released exactly one year ago today in Australia. To say the least, I was blown away by this film. The cinematography is exciting. The editing is timed perfectly. The production design is simple, vibrant and beautiful. This movie is put together like a masterpiece. The performances are so real and grounded. Particularly Emma Stone, who never for a moment makes it known that she is an actor playing a character. The depth of her emotion forms such a realistic and complex human being. The music written by Justin Hurwitz is simply perfection. This is one of my favourite movie scores of all time. His music creates such complex emotions, with his mixture of happiness and melancholy. This is easily my favourite musical ever made. This is because the characters and drama are not neglected at the expense of the musical numbers. They a both intertwined beautifully. Each element is placed together with so much thought, that it successfully transports the audience into such a deep emotional experience. This film contains so much talent and creativity, that it would be impossible not to give it a 10. I know a fair few people who really dislike La La Land. This movie is not for your average audience. It's really for those who love and appreciate the craft of film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

High School Musical Meets West Side Story,"Hmm, that was something different. This is kind of like two movies in one. The first half was surprisingly amateurish with respect to the singing and dancing. I give Ryan Gosling a pat-on-the-back award for trying both of these skills, but anyone who is expecting Fred Astaire or Gene Kelley will be sorely disappointed. I get it. I get the fact that the film inserts stylized re-enactments of old Hollywood movie scenes. That's nice, but it didn't sell me on the film. For the first half of the film, you will see performances that can be matched by performances at your local high school. What I don't get is Emma Stone. Sure, we all have our personal preferences but she seems completely unsuited for the role of Ryan Gosling's romantic obsessions. However, if they ever decide to film ET's Revenge, she has my vote.Just as I was ready to write this film off completely, it turned around. This happened, it seems to me, during the observatory dance scene. That was creative. Around this time, the film begins to develop some angst and the relationship between the two characters suddenly becomes much more complex and intriguing. Some will like the ending, some won't, but, for me, it did seem a little forced. Still, the second half of the film brought into focus more serious points about relationships and life, in general, to save it.Should you see it? Well, watch the opening scene. If you can take that, you can survive the film. Trust me it gets better. Should it receive a best picture award? Well, it's at least something different, reminiscent of the award winning, The Artist. Let's just say that if it wins, I will grudgingly accept the Academy's verdict.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Don't waste your time!,"This movie is not good. The high reviews are probably studio people or friends and family of all the cast & crew involved in this film! I really like both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, but neither can carry a tune in this movie! I'm not saying these two needed to be Shirley Jones and Frank Sinatra, but at least find 2 people that can sing!! We know Emmy Rossum can sing and they could have cast Patrick Wilson. For a musical, it's not just star power, the leads have to be able to sing! (or at least dub some beautiful voice in, like they did for Natalie Wood in West Side Story).Plus, the story is quite boring and very slow. Girl meets boy, girl gets boy. Girl loses boy. (Yawn!!) Then there's the issue of maybe only one semi-catchy tune, add that to the boring story and you've got yourself a snooze-fest. Which no self respecting ""musical"" should ever be.JK Simmons is really good in the 2-3 minutes he's in the movie, but no one else is even remotely memorable. In a role any male actor could have played, they waste Tom Everett Scott. By the way, the opening production number is very clever, but the song is not good by any means. I've already forgotten the tune or even the name of the song! The story isn't worth summarizing here as it's too boring to repeat. Very, very disappointing!

The film of the year. A true piece of cinematic magic,"Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, I present to you what very well could (and should) be this years Best Picture winner; La La Land.From the films incredibly choreographed opening scene, La La Land becomes an eye catching, toe-tapping and most importantly of all joyous movie going experience and the film transforms a story that at its core is rather generic into something else entirely, that will very likely place La La Land into the top echelon of cinematic musicals, as well as a classic of our time.Quite the feat then for third time feature film director Damian Chazelle.Announcing himself to the film world with his sweat-inducing drummer thriller Whiplash in 2014, La La Land is Chazelle stamping himself into the ranks of the great directors working in the industry today.The jazz loving artist is a talent worth all the praise he receives, as every thread of Chazelle's love letter to Hollywood, jazz, romance and perhaps most importantly of all, dreaming, is a pure piece of cinematic ecstasy.Alongside DOP Linus Sandgren (whose work here may well lead to a hefty individual awards haul this season), his composer Justin Hurwitz and genuinely the whole team behind this production, Chazelle has crafted up that rare movie beast, a unique tapestry of brilliance that practically bounces along frame to frame and is matched majestically by its two leads, who in turn give us a duo of characters we are unlikely to forget anytime soon.Tasked with not only reigniting the chemistry they shared in the likable 2011 romantic comedy Crazy Stupid Love and the 2013 Gangster Squad but pulling off the unenviable task of singing and dancing their way into the moviegoers hearts, Emma Stone as the big dreaming wannabe actress Mia and Ryan Gosling as jazz loving hard-done-by musician Sebastian make for a lovable on screen duo whose relationship together is all at once alluring, believable and at times heartbreaking.The bond between these two starry-eyed lovers is one you can't help but be swept up by as their individual plights and plans take shape, so do our affections towards them as Mia and Sebastian become one of the modern era's most engaging on screen couples.The two actors are, safe to say, equally deserving of awards, yet as good as Gosling is in a role he seemed tailor made to play this is in many ways Stone's true star making turn that will be nigh on impossible for any of her naysayers to deny. She can no longer just be the lovable redhead from Easy A or Zombieland or the lucky to be there Oscar nominee from Birdman.In another year where Natalie Portman didn't too give what appears to be the performance of her career, the Best Actess would've been Stone's for the taking (Stone's rendition of the film's key song Audition is a true showstopper and proof enough of this) but regardless of the results of such statue giving, Stone's layered turn here is one for the ages.There's a lot more to be said about this spellbinding romance that just so happens to express itself through its songs and music as well as its very setting but at the end of the day for anyone that calls themselves a movie lover, La La Land is a brilliantly conceived big screen experience unlike anything we've seen before and a true big screen must-see.In a year of largely forgettable and cookie cutter experiences, Chazelle's love letter to film, the city of lights and following your dreams should be something that's savoured and enjoyed not only in the coming months, but for years yet to come.5 observatory waltzes out of 5",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
One of the best movies I've seen this year! (or any other year for that matter),"I've always been a fan, not just of fine acting in a movie, but of well written movie as well. In both instances La La Land does not disappoint. From the opening scene to the end credits, La La Land is one of the most Thought provoking, emotionally fulfilling, and romantic films in recent memory. The pacing is perfect. The acting and writing so good, that the movie seemed a lot shorter than it's actual run-time (around two hours). Yes, it's that good.It's funny too, because Jazz is one of my least favorite musical genres. However, this did not adversely affect my enjoyment of the film one bit. It was simply Sebastian's passion (Ryan Gosling) as Mia's (Emma Stone)was acting.This film has won many awards and deservedly so. It's not by accident that the scores on IMDb, Rotton tomatoes, and metacritic are off the charts. I understand that universal acclaim does not guarantee that one will enjoy this film, as I myself have seen films in the past that were wildly popular that I did not enjoy as much as the majority. But the fact of this films success should grab your attention at least.I guess what it comes down to is whether you like Musicals with original songs that are actually memorable long after the movies over. Or whether you enjoy an intelligent movie that's well written and executed to near perfection. Or if you enjoy the work of Emma Stone or Ryan Gosling. Because if you like all or only some of the above things than your almost assuredly going to enjoy La La Land!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
La La Land will always be remembered as the film that nearly got Best Picture.,"Now, as most of you know, I dislike musicals. Randomly bursting into song is just not to my taste, at all. Then La La Land came along and I consistently read ""overrated"", ""boring"" and ""snoozefest"" by most amateur reviewers. After literally just watching this, I can confidently say instantaneously, La La Land is phenomenal. Oh. My. Word. I love it when I'm wrong, and I was so wrong about this. I cannot fault it. I have fallen in love with La La Land. You could say I've gone la la for it! Where to even begin!? This isn't just a musical. This is a homage to classic cinema, an endearing tribute to all those silver screen masterpieces that have moulded Hollywood to what it is today. Dive beneath the glossy surface and I found myself experiencing a story about fulfilling dreams, pursuing passions and just live life to its fullest. It evoked pure joy from me, genuine happiness. I have never smiled and teared up simultaneously to a film before, ever. Yet Damien Chazelle went and only done that. His direction was absolutely outstanding. From the gorgeous long takes to the vibrant colour usage. He deserved every award. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling both gave magically enigmatic performances, particularly the former who mesmerised me with her solo audition performance. The choreography during the dance sequences defines classy, imitating the classic pairing of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The soundtrack will be instantly downloaded, 'City of Stars' and 'Mia & Sebastian's Theme' were the highlights. The production, costume and sound design were all perfect. The dimming of the lights to focus on the characters felt refreshingly revelatory. Urghhh I think I'm in love. This is why I adore the medium of film. To capture the magic of a whirlwind romance in a joyous perspective. It is undoubtedly rare to watch a film in this calibre. I never thought I would say this but...La La Land gets the perfect rating.

This is LA.,"I really like LA which is the stage of this movie, but I'm not satisfied with the way to end the story, actually. However, we can also say that it's a typical love story through musical. To put it simply, it also shows us our real issues of what we have to think about what our important and valuable thing is. I think this is the most difficult issue which everyone faces.The jazz music in it is especially comfortable to listen to. It makes me play the saxophone or the piano again since I was a junior high school student.Also, it's private, but I'd been in LA for a year until last summer, and I like Los Angeles very much as I mentioned above.

Feels both traditional and contemporary,"There was a time I remember, sometime during the mid-to-late '90s, when the idea of watching a musical was laughable. It was a silly trend that was once popular with the movie-going audience back when cinema was relatively primitive, which saw a kitschy revival in the '70s and '80s with the likes of Grease (1978) and Xanadu (1980), but died a death when the rapid evolution of CGI made anything possible on screen. Then came Moulin Rouge! and its use of modernised classic tunes in 2001, and movie-goers have been in love with the genre again ever since. Its popularity shows no sign of stopping either, and writer/director Damien Chazelle, who made a big impression in 2014 with the excellent Whiplash, has sculpted one of the best musicals of recent times with the Oscar-nominated La La Land, a film that manages to feel both traditional and contemporary.The film combines two elements clearly dear to Chazelle: The lavish musicals of the 1950s (and to a lesser degree the '40s), and pure jazz. The two wandering souls at the story's centre dream of leaving their mark in their respected fields, but both are in love with the past in industries always looking forward. Actress Mia (Emma Stone) spends time between humiliating and soul-crushing auditions serving coffee near a studio lot, where she occasionally crosses paths with a glamorous star as the rest of the room whisper excitedly. Musician Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) cannot resist ignoring the festive playlist at his restaurant haunt in favour of some improvisation on the piano - much to the annoyance of his boss Bill (J.K. Simmons) - while he dreams of opening his own traditional jazz bar. Sebastian is quick- tempered, neurotic, and plain rude, but Mia pursues him anyway. They fall in love, and express their feelings through impromptu song-and- dance routines.Chazelle knows the genre inside out, and seems to favour the lavish MGM musicals and the glamorous physicality of the era's stars such as Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Opening with a near one-shot song-and-dance routine, beautifully photographed by Linus Sandgren, it goes on to deliver many dazzling and classical numbers, which are often glorious to behold and backed by a soundtrack of memorable tunes that manage to stay in your head for days afterwards. They are performed admirably by the central pair, who have real chemistry. One of the few saving graces of the Amazing Spider-Man films was the chemistry between Stone and Andrew Garfield, and here she sizzles with Gosling. It's the movie's main strength. Rather than merely go through the motions and familiar tropes, you really want them to be together. You can truly feel their happiness every time they see each other.La La Land stutters when exploring deeper, more complex themes. The second act sees the two achieve some degree of success, with Mia developing a one-woman show and Sebastian joining up with a fellow musician played by John Legend in a band making waves in the world of jazz. Will Mia ultimately degrade herself in order to make it in a brutal industry that may not deserve her, and how can Sebastian, a hardcore old-schooler, be happy in a flashy group looking to move the genre forward? It seems like a poor excuse to simply tear the couple apart to experience their inevitable rough patch, and doesn't really fully explore the characters' emotional quandaries. But this slight lag doesn't last for very long, and the final moments are simply perfect. One of the great things about Whiplash was that final, heart- pounding moment of physical and spiritual triumph, and La La Land wraps up the story with grace and genuine tugs on the heartstrings. proving itself to be much more than a mere homage.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Had potential,"I cannot remember being so bored in a theater. My wife, who loves romances, told me later she considered leaving after the first 30 minutes. Which is sad, because there are many good elements in the film and the story line, though thin, could have given us more reason for caring about the characters. Two young struggling artists meet, fall in love, but choose fame over love. Okay. Except there was no struggle. Unlike the thousands of people who do struggle to live a life in art, these two must have had trust funds. Every sequence that could have given the characters more depth was swept away in a song. Which brings me to the other problem. Great musicals have great songs, but the film had none (though the jazz scenes were very entertaining). The film did attain a level of excellence in the final scene sequence - a wistful musical imagining of what could have been. If the film as a whole could have reached this level, it would have been an excellent musical. Unfortunately it took an hour and a half before the film created sufficient context for the music and dance to have this level of relevance. Perhaps the film's popularity can be accounted for by unfamiliarity with the genre. Music Man or Cabaret it was not.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Looking forward to meet u in London How is Betty and Lucy Please write back Go Linus Go Linus GreatHugs BingoPlease read thisIn his first film since 'Whiplash,' Damien Chazelle stages a lavish song-and-dance musical that dares to swoon the old-fashioned way, with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as L.A. dreamers.There was a moment back in the 1970s, sometime before ""Grease"" came out, when the image of people bursting into song and dance in the middle of a motion picture wasn't simply corny and antiquated; it had come to seem downright strange. Not any more. Our era is immersed in retro musical culture, and it has been for a while — from the visionary postmodern pop swoon of ""Moulin Rouge!"" to the online resurgence of music video to the high-camp a Capella sincerity of ""Glee"" and the ""Pitch Perfect"" films.

They simply don't make movies like this!,"I would like to begin this review by saying that I don't give anything away (spoilers free review) and all I say is in NO way hyping the film... The film is just that good fellas! It is difficult and quite honestly impossible for me to take a minute, sit down, and think: ""what did I truly liked the most out of this film?""Let's start off by saying that, ever since Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) takes the piano and plays it, I felt so drawn by the sheer melody... Here I am a day later and it is just implanted in my subconscious. I find myself whistling ""City of Stars"" like I just heard it for the first time. Without giving anything away, Ryan Gosling's dedication for the role is of the utmost respect and its result is majestic. Speaking of which, the soundtrack of this film is undeniably addictive. It is emotionally driven with the style of Jazz on its back. Yes, it is a musical, the music plays a big role but it is unbelievable how the music in this film isn't its greatest achievement.Before revealing the greatest achievement, I would like to praise other key factors o the film: the costumes, the cinematography of the movie scenes , which where incredibly satisfying for the eyesight, the colors of the sets, the choreography which was traditional and ""old school""... Everything surrounding the greatest achievement of the film gave that little extra boost needed for it to be one of the best movie experiences I've ever had.Without further ado, the ""coup de grâce"", was the final sequence. The last 10 minutes of the film. All throughout the film, the character development was incredible and it lead to me being completely emotionally drawn to both of the characters by the end of the film. At the end, you can feel the atmosphere, you can actually feel what they are meant to feel and how they react to it. The movie itself is near-perfect but it isn't until the last sequence that it reaches perfection. For a movie to be so good, and end in a perfect note...

The Most Dazzling Movie Experience Of 2016,"The most dazzling movie experience of 2016 is an original contemporary musical shot in the style of old Hollywood classics yet more forward-looking & grounded in reality. Bursting with passion, overflowing with heartfelt emotions, and intimately captures the magic of cinema in all its glory, La La Land is an irresistible, inescapable & infatuating rhapsody that's brought to life with incredible restraint & precision craftsmanship, and is a musical masterpiece for the ages.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
They'd crossed each others life while chasing their dreams.,"I am not a big fan of modern musical films. So I was not expecting it to be a great or worst. The film opened with a song that I was not happy, because I did not like the verse or the music. And again to say, the modern timeline does not suit for the musical theme, unless it is a fantasy or an Indian film.The best part of the film was, those song fades away as the film progresses. But I kind of liked the drama/story part and the climax track with the quick flashback (kind of). Till that scene I was considering it an average film, but that one scene changed my stance. So, now I think it is a good film, but winning 6 Oscars, I don't know it deserved that.Yes, the director is known for making music and musical film, but he has not made many. He's young and so his career. Yep, I loved 'Whiplash'. One of my all time favourite. If that film had won 10 Oscars, I would have not surprised at all. After that flick, the people were anticipating, to exceed that success in this film. As it was received, no doubt for those people it was a different flick, but not for me. Especially if you watch lots of Indian films. By the way the film characters were nice, and so the story, but not the songs.Gosling and Stone were performed well. The chemistry between them was great. The narration was going decently until the end, which reminded me 'Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya' ending that I was not happy about, yet something different than usual. Sometimes I am okay with cliché than this kind of conclusion, just to bring a change in storytelling. Overall an enjoyable film, most people would love it. Some like me would say it is a decent flick, but there's always a few who would never favour it. Yet worth a watch.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Terrific and a wholehearted  pleasure!,As this is IMDb I am amazed at not the negative reviews but the nature of the hostility expressed. It is one thing of course not to appreciate a film but is it really necessary to be so vindictive? La La Land as a film may be the antidote. Those of us who appreciate it can take consolation that the awards that came (and more may be coming) will give added pleasure to top what is already a feel good film experience. To finish I would like to comment with reference to those reviews that go beyond the pale. In Bad Day at Black Rock Spencer Tracy says and I para-phrase.... You are wrong. Not only are you wrong but you are wrong in a long loud voice.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"A enjoyable movie that was never dull, and was truly fun to watch","While the storyline may not be appreciated by all who watch this film, there is no denying this is one masterpiece of a film. Chazelle's use of colour, sound and light are some of the most creative I've ever seen. The cinematography was used very creatively to work with the other visual components of the film. Both Gosling and Stone give terrific performances and perfectly showcase their skills in both acting and singing. Ultimately, a very enjoyable cinematic experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Overrated copy of Jacques Demy/Michel Legrand,"It seems not too many know the French director Jacques Demy's films, especially his musicals like 'The young girls of Rochefort' or 'The umbrellas of Cherbourg' or 'Donkey Skin' - nor Michel Legrand, who scored these as well as many other films. Those were made in the late 60ies and 70ies. They are available on Netflix - highly recommended!Obviously the director of LaLaLand watched them over and over again but he failed totally in recreating them and transporting them into our times.I find the music of LaLaLand with the exception of its main song rather forgettable, the same with most of the choreography. The lead actors are OK, but I don't see any depth. The story line is rather thin, very cookie cutter and weighed down by too much sentimentality.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"Unfortunate Title, Tremendous Movie","My review of La La Land (no spoilers, but perhaps a few too many semicolons, run- on sentences, and parentheses ahead):You should understand, for starters, that I don't like many ""critically acclaimed"" movies. Odds are, if it is nominated for Best Picture, I'll probably find it pretentious and tedious. I'm not a man that loves mindless action, but I do typically prefer my films a little more on the mainstream side of the aisle.La La Land, however, walks a masterful line. It is at once funny, poignant, novel, retro, gripping, layered, and very straightforward. It is a movie that knows that - as a full-on song-and-dance musical - it cannot be taken literally; and yet, while it winks and nods at the audience, it manages to tell a serious and timeless tale. I felt the weight and import of the decisions demanded of the protagonists, and still could laugh out loud at the comedy. And laugh I did. Repeatedly. Once I let go and immersed myself in the universe of the movie (and this movie demands that you either check in or out immediately - as in literally from the opening seconds of the film), I found myself looking forward to the next inside joke and the perfect deadpan delivery by Emma Stone. The film has an infectious, innocent exuberance that carries you along on a wave of happiness, even when the subject matter gets melancholy.Or at least, it does in the first half. If I have complaint about this picture, it is that somewhere in the final act, a kind of moroseness sets in that is out of balance with the joviality of the first half. I understand that the direction of the character development requires some tonal changes, and I don't fault the movie for it. Even factoring plot requirements into the equation, though, I felt that the movie changed character in its latter stages in a way that was unpleasantly jarring. This was not an unpardonable infraction, however; in fact, I think that the film managed to find itself in the waning minutes in a way that was powerful and sweet. As the credits began their crawl, I found myself in profound thought, not sure whether to cry from joy or sadness. Without spoiling any of the plot development, this is not a film that makes conclusions for you - it lets you reach your own decisions about its climax - but it certainly requires you to ponder.This should be obvious. After all, isn't that the goal of any story? Yet most movies fail to so move me. It seems that most storytellers, including Chazelle himself in his previous oeuvre Whiplash, either fail to give you enough stake in the story to warrant the effort to really search your soul, or manipulate you into it through gimmick and misdirection. La La Land manages to get you there without resorting to falsehood. Any misdirection it uses in the final minutes is directly and openly atoned-for as the conclusion is reached and the viewer is left with some honest questions to ask themselves. The movie achieves this without forcing its morals upon you or foisting any political ideations into the debate.In the end, you are left with a pleasurable experience, catchy music, good laughs, and some introspection about how Seb and Mia's shoes might fit you for a mile or so. It is unfortunately-named, and suffers from a little too much jazz-worship, and ultimately I wonder how well it will hold up on second viewing, but based solely on how much I enjoyed myself in the theater, this is my pick for best movie of the year (move aside, Rogue One, you had your week at the top), and perhaps best since Lincoln (another exception to the Best Picture rule). Your mileage may vary.Lastly (actually penultimately - I added something else below, but don't want to edit the paragraph), a word about the film from a parent's perspective: I didn't really want to go see this film. I only went because I wanted a date with my 9 year old and I don't feel comfortable with the violence in Rogue One and have no desire to see Sing. This movie is PG 13, and after viewing, I think 13 is a good minimum age. This is not at all because of objectionable content - in fact, besides a barely audible f-bomb and some other fairly innocuous profanity and a little immodesty, there is nearly nothing to object to - but because the film doesn't shy away from subjects that are deep and mature. My daughter loved the singing and dancing and conviviality that often brightened the theater, but she didn't understand the more existential questions of purpose, fulfillment, relationships, and missed opportunities that are ultimately at the core of this film. As such, she walked away with a decidedly mixed reaction and a complaint that the movie was too long. In the end, I agree that it could use about 10 more minutes of excision - mostly in the second hour - but I believe her impression was less a fault of the movie, and more a fault of her youth. Don't hesitate to take your kids with you to see this film, but don't be surprised if they don't really get it.I've only ever been on the front row for two films. The first was Avatar in IMAX, and now this. No film should ever be seen from the front row, but I chose two particularly bad films to so endure. Avatar for obvious reasons, and La La Land because much of the film is shot in single-take roving-camera sets and with shots that purposely put focus on both sides of the scene simultaneously for artistic and symbolic purpose. Do yourself a favor: if it is sold out, wait for the next showing rather than taking that front-row seat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

What is all the fuss about?,"I don't understand what all the fuss is about this film. Maybe it appeals to a generation that has never seen a decent musical before. It has one good song (the one that keeps playing on the radio here) and that's it. Emma Stone is not a particularly strong singer and Ryan Gosling is in the same league as Rex Harrison. Although they can both dance pretty well, every extra on the screen dances better. The choreography is mundane and the transitions into song and dance often feel completely forced. However, if this marks the start of a new golden age of musicals, with a new generation of stars who can actually sing and dance, then bring it on.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Welcome to L.A.,"The producers must have had deep pockets to be able to afford all those hit songs of the eighties that adorn this exhaustingly stylish semi-remake of 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' (ironically released the year the Oscar for best picture went to that overproduced bore 'My Fair Lady') complete with captions recording the passing seasons but without Michel Legrand's heart rending score; whose dayglo colours also recall Coppola's ill-fated 'One from the Heart' nearly forty years ago.A bit too much in love with it's own cleverness, it ought to be accompanied by a checklist of all the old movies it pastiches and name-checks (starting with the opening shot resembling that of 'Touch of Evil', following by the camera diving into a swimming pool like in 'I Am Cuba', and so on).",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
This is true Cinema in every way there is !!!,"This movie is so good, it will make you not want to see anything else for a while, that's how strong the after taste is.

Ryan Gosling is such a James Dean it's not funny. He has achieved the Cult Status already, hope and pray he just stays longer unlike his predecessors (James Dean, Steve Mcqueen & Heath Ledger). Emma Stone grows over you slowly to only make you eventually realize, that no one could have done it better. The Director has done us a favor by creating this masterpiece for our viewing pleasure and engaging our senses in ways that are totally unpredictable and therefore completely refreshing.He has made the biggest contribution to dying Jazz music through La La Land & Whiplash.

I only sat through the whole thing so as not to disturb my fellow movie-goers.

The Best Cinematic Experience of My Life.,"I've seen quite a few movies, especially the ones that appear each year in award nominations, so I feel like I have a decent perspective. I remember Whiplash and loved it, and when I saw that this film was from the same creator, I got excited. After I watched the trailer months ago, I shared with probably everyone. I waited months for it to finally make it to theaters.I saw it right after Christmas and I had high expectations and was a little worried that wasn't going to meet them. But forget that. La La Land exceeded those far and away. I'm not a 'movie critic' so I won't try to use the fancy and eloquent review style of writing, I'll just tell it like it is.This movie is the most beautiful thing I've seen on screen, and quite possibly the most beautiful piece of performance art I've ever seen too. It's beautifully shot, the music is incredibly addictive and full of emotion, the story is timeless, and the acting (especially from the leads) is absolutely outstanding. Thank God these two ended up in these roles, because the chemistry and character of the two is simply perfect.La La Land takes you on an incredible roller-coaster that's beautiful in every way. Technically, the film is a musical, but don't let that turn you off (if that's not your thing). It makes the story twice as good. There aren't too many musical numbers and each of them is incredible, as well as important to the story. I love musicals, so that probably helped, but the point is, you're going to love this one. You fall in love with the characters, with the music, with the story, and this movie will affect you. Each of us can relate to La La Land, and the film makes me want more out of life, but at the same time it gives an incredible experience just watching it happen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
A naive homage to the musicals of yesteryear,"If you've seen classics that clearly inspired multiple facets of this film, like ""An American in Paris,"" ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""A Star is Born,"" and lesser films like ""Xanadu,""and ""Fame,"" you may find ""La La Land"" less than inspiring, despite its decent songs. Emma Stone was very good, but Gosling nearly ruined the film with his saturnine presence; there are many actors who could have done a better job. Overall, it presents a heavily romanticized version of L.A., giving the impression that the city is largely defined by Pasadena, Griffith Park, the Santa Monica Pier and the Hollywood Hills. These and other script elements certainly betray director/writer Chazelle's youth and lack of real-life experience. Most actors in L.A. never get (paid) work in films or TV, and the small percentage who do mostly get work in commercials and as (non-union) extras. Most would gladly eat out of dumpsters for months for the chance to get a SAG card. Given that jazz clubs are few in L.A., and regularly feature established artists of the genre with a lot more experience than Gosling's character has, some of his character's actions and attitudes are largely preposterous. In short, a derivative diversion with some good songs and a luminous performance from Emma Stone. It lacks the zest and joie de vivre to make a strong impression on the big screen. It may play better on video.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"You might like it, and there's nothing wrong with that!","OK so this kind of movie really isn't my thing. I'm certainly not into musicals. Although I appreciate great acting and great music.

If you dislike musicals and jazz, I'd suggest you give this a wide berth!The opening part on the freeway and some of the later scenes had me reaching for the sick bag...and now a song, for no reason, staged backdrops and jumping around, cliché. Why not make a movie with all the great music but have filmed stage performances and rehearsals instead of interjected 'and now...a song' moments? I suppose it wouldn't be a musical, but whatever.It would never be my go-to movie, but for some people, probably many wives and girlfriends it's a nice little comfort-blanket escapism piece of enjoyable fluff that's sincere, competent and harmless.

La La Land,"I wonder if I had just stumbled upon this movie, being Damien Chazelle's third as director, not knowing anything or knowing little about it, if I would've liked/loved/fallen head over heels for it more than I did. Because of the state of the independent film scene (and this is one of those mid-way movies like Pulp Fiction, where it has its toes in indie and mainstream Hollywood, the latter if nothing else via its stars and setting), movies like La La Land come backed with the kind of hype that usually would be reserved for, say, a Star Wars movie. It also has to do too with the director's previous, Whiplash, being a ride that gives Emotional Roller-coaster its clichéd status, since it was the announcement of a director (from my generation/exact age group) swinging for the fences. And La La Land, with its major reviews and festival runs, seemed like another one. And it is, ultimately, a great movie. Could it have been better? Hmm.Sometimes, furthermore, coming right off from seeing as movie and dumping thoughts and feelings out like a raccoon spilling a garbage can at night and scattering the contents is not always ""correct"" as one might say. It may take another viewing, or a few days, to get more of what I felt about it. But I can say that this is a movie about musicals and musical about movies, and usually these cross and twist like it's a dance out in outer space. Chazelle is also bringing a story that is so familiar - artists in music and performance, close enough as the same thing, who meet, have a little push-and-pull at first (they first meet by the usual serendipity of LA traffic jam) - that it could be criticized as a rehash. Hell, we just had a movie come out a month ago/around this same time, Nocturnal Animals, that, if you look closely, isn't too far off (though the endings are VERY different, which I'll get to what is so gobsmackingly JOYFUL about this movie).Gosling and Stone first were paired five years ago in Crazy Stupid Love, and I'm sure Chazelle knew this and bet on it being stronger this time around. Though as a nitpick (and it should be mentioned) Gosling can't sing anything exceptional, Stone can and they know how to dance and bond and kiss and bring the romance out in full force. La La Land would be a beautiful exercise in technicalities, of pulling off all of the care-free MOVIE ideas that Chazelle has (seriously, he's about as geeky in his homage as Tarantino - notice the Ingrid Bergman wall- sized poster in Mia's place and other parts, or the whole use of the WB lot), but what makes it a triumph is that the actors work well together and separately. More than well, they find the truth in the clichés that come with artists-trying-to-make-it and sell it as well as Chazelle's script can get them to.Which, perhaps, is the one thing that keeps me from saying 'OMG THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE I've EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE' (which, again, hype) - it takes you so immediately into musical terrain with its opening number in LA traffic that it's jarring to then go back into the 'real' world, more or less. Songs of course happen, but it's a balancing act, and all the while Chazelle's story points for these two is so familiar as far as the 'What Happens When You Follow Your Dreams in Artistic/Corporate America' thing that it goes into what could almost be dangerous terrain - not embracing and finding a truth in cliché, but just being conventional (i.e. how Gosling becomes a piano player in a group John Legend's got, and this takes him away from his actual 'dream' of a jazz club, and then Stone's Mia's dream of being an actress, etc etc so forth and so on).... And then the final 15 minutes or so happens, where we flash ahead five years to what's happened with these two people who, at one point, went to the same planetarium as in Rebel Without a Cause and dance and go into the stratosphere of the galaxy (I'm reminded of the French New Wave, a lot, by the way, in how much Chazelle embraces post-modern self-consciousness; if Breathless was his Whiplash, is this his, uh, A Woman is a Woman?) And the two of them have changed, more or less, and Gosling plays a song that transports into the 'what if' and it's... I don't have words for it. It's what the movies are about. It's a magical, wonderful 15 minutes that reminded me why I can stand being around people whispering (like I don't hear you, old bastards) and munching popcorn and can be transported into a completely made-up, empathetic landscape.My first instinct is to go for the typical critical bulls*** of saying 'this is ""better"" than this' (that is Whiplash vs La La Land), but it doesn't matter. That last fifteen minutes, and many other scenes and Stone's performance and the dancing and the whole color palette and the cinematography (oh man, I don't care if you're verging from homage into rip-off of PT Anderson, it's so delicious for my eyes to look at), confirms that Chazelle is the real deal, a filmmaker with something to say about the human experience, about what it means to chase that unfortunate dragon known as the ""dream"" of artists and musicians and actors and so on, and at the same time can bring it forward with... soul. It takes a little time, but my instinct is to call this a soulful Hollywood movie first, beautiful homage second.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Emma Stone can act very well, but Ryan Gosling was so FLAT. There isn't anything superior about this musical. Maybe if you have a great attention span, you will find this enjoyable. There's nothing that compels you to finish watching this. It's boring and not a good movie. And the singing and sounding editing is horrible. You can barely hear the singing.

How has this been nominated?,"I usually don't write reviews, but i felt in this case I had to. Having seen so many reviews and people raging about how wonderful this film is, I truly hate to say it, but oh how wrong they are. Firstly, as actors and people I enjoy Ryan and Emma's work, I think they are both incredibly talented and work well together. However, their styles and talents were not suitable for this movie, this was a musical-I would expect the actors to be better than sub-par singers. The dancing element, albeit abrupt and highly unnecessary in many cases, was well done, the routines were quite abstract and I enjoyed them. The story line was nothing more than predictable and in the end rather disappointing. I saw this movie with friends and the only reason why we didn't walk out was simply out of worry that one of us was enjoying it. (We weren't). There are no words I can use to recommend you to see this film - as I would be lying if I did.Please don't waste your money - It is a cross between a low budget Mama Mia, and a rather terrible Hallmark movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Best Cinematic Experience,"This movie was absolutely amazing in all aspects including cinematic, story, songs, and visuals. It connects with the viewers, especially ones that have big dreams. This film brought me to tears, because I felt that I connected with Mia (Emma Stone) on such an emotional level. I have never been this moved by a film before. I feel the joy in my heart just hearing the songs and watching the film. I saw it three times in theaters and each experience was as great as the first. Gosling and Stone are magic on screen and their chemistry is electric.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
emotional appeal infused with music,"There may be many philosophical reasons to contradict the story of this movie and they are pretty accurate in their own right but that doesn't make this movie any less genius. Hollywood movies are mostly dry of emotional appeal and ""love"" is pretty much objectified by stuffing sexuality in a well thought strategic point of the movie. This movie is like a breath of fresh air in suffocating idea of romanticism. movie is trying to depict love and passion in realistic and idealistic way at the same time. another factor is its emotional appeal, very few movies try to connect with the daily life of common people - which is a good selling strategy for movies. music have succeeded in communicating emotions to the audience. Emma stone have been herself and was well suited for this movie but Ryan have done exceptional job. i think this movie is very original and artistic as it shows every moment with the right level of intensity it deserves. it is obvious that such romanticism isn't helpful in real life but if one could show various forms of romanticism(i.e. with another human, with career, with music, etc), it would come out like this movie..",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
saw  this movie with my wife,"Honestly , I took this movie as a popcorn movie , just for killing an afternoon with my wife . And the first 3/4 part of the film exactly matched my expectation , till the fall came . I am not a native English speaker , and in my culture ,the autumn means mature, and harvest . SO ,I took it as a mater of course that the hero and heroine will be together till the end of world with fantastic success in each one's business . then the light turned on and people left with delight . but suddenly it turned out to be a fall , then I realized it would no be a film which i had deemed . the following story was what i did like. a bit of mild melancholy, but aestheticism . not perfect ,but realism . It's a story in LA ,but I believe every young or was young man or woman would be touched wherever he or she living . I held my wife's hand ,we are old spouse now . have a happy family and lovely son . but , once we met something seemed unavoidable and unconquerable let us within an inch of breaking .fortunately we overcame it ,that make us could appreciate the movie quietly instead of wiping the tears at the corner alone .All I want to say to this film is "" thank you, thanks for give us a happy and meaningful afternoon """,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Not the best!,"Emma Stone is Mia and Ryan Gosling is Sebastian in the musical drama named 'La La Land'.The movie introduces you a musical world of colors,songs and dance, cheering you with two beautiful characters - Mia and Serb.They have a story together against the backdrop of great music and brilliant cinematography.

It is disappointing to see a movie with all fine ingredients in it but not blended enough to create that magic.An overly stress in creating this magical musical world has done little justice to the real story of the movie.But, I would not hold back appreciate Damien Chazelle for his attempt.Justin Hurwitz has done a great job as music director.

One of the best movies of the year for 2016.  A classic old-school musical in a modern setting.,"I was hopeful when I saw the early news about this film but didn't expect it to be as wonderful as it was. From the opening sequence to the final credits, you will be tapping your toes and dancing in your seats. Great performances, even if some of the vocals are a little understated (which might just be a creative decision).La La Land could have been set in almost in decade of the last 100 years but fits rather perfectly in the contemporary time setting.Ryan Gosling learned to play piano for the film and does a great job with his performance.Emma Stone gives a stellar performance where you feel that she is standing in the theater with you and giving you her heart and soul.Do yourself a favor and go see it.

"Great leads, as actors, not singers and dancers","I was struggling to engage each time it showed it was a musical. Gosling and Stone are very talented actors, but not born singers or dancers, especially Gosling, bless his heart. To make a musical thrive and not feel awkward you have to fully commit and have talent. Neither happened in La La Land. Take out the song and dance numbers and the story just isn't strong enough to make up for it. I'll add 1 star for Stone's effort when singing, she was clearly trying her best and the result was ok. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
The stuff that dreams are made of...,"""La La Land"" is the kind of movie that you can't help but fall in love with for the sheer energy that oozes out of every frame, every note and every second its on the screen. It really puts you into an inexplicable kind of trance, you become completely lost in its lust and aesthetic beauty. Director Damien Chazelle, already the youngest winner of the Best Director Award in the history of the Golden Globes, may very well accomplish the same feat tomorrow at the Oscars.The premise of the film is simple: A jazz pianist falls for an aspiring actress in Los Angeles. We've heard it before, but what ""La La Land"" actually creates with a rather hackneyed plot line is anything but unoriginal. In fact, Chazelle deserves a ton of credit for creating a completely original musical, one that bursts with toe-tappingly poetic songs and melodies that will be entrenched in people's mind for a long time. He even pays homage to the more classic films of the Hollywood Golden Age by showing us alternate endings (many films of that era were known to film two endings) but how Chazelle masterfuly juxtaposes the fiction to reality merits an Oscar alone.Aside from the incredible acting, cinematography and writing, one thing I must comment on about ""La La Land"" is the beautiful jazz score. This soundtrack is near close to perfect, especially for those that adore jazz. It perfectly encapsulates all those idealist thoughts people have when daydreaming about cities like LA or NYC. Have you ever listened to jazz music and, to quote fellow IMDb user ElMaruecan82, just felt nostalgic over a time you weren't even born in? Like ""La La Land"", Jazz has all the elements that pulls you in as a viewer: it has melody, it has harmony, it has rhythm, but most of all, it has soul. And boy, does this film have soul. It's energy is relentless and simply undeniable.Coupled with the beautiful musical score and exceptionally well written songs (""City of Stars"", in particular, is enchanting) is first-rate acting by Gosling and Stone. Gosling can really do so many roles but where I find him most effective is in his minimalism - he's really one of few actors who can show so much with so little. His subtlety and nuances create such depth and mystery in a character like Sebastien you could find yourself spending hours pondering over what he is merely thinking. Stone was great as well, seemingly effortless in her ability to project a charm and likability. Together, their chemistry was electric; they really just looked like they were having a great time out there (for anyone who says they couldn't dance/sing well).Honestly, I could go on for days about the magic of this film and this likely won't be the final copy of this review for reasons of continuing to think over and re-phrase my thoughts of the film; I get what people are saying about how the film finds a way to stick in your head. Case in point, ""La La Land"" is the stuff that dreams are made of. And whether you're part of the group that despises the film or not, one can't deny the elegance, style and melodic magic the film possesses, and the ability it has to totally immerse you in all its jazzy glory; and isn't that, by some measure, what any film really aspires to do?",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"Here's Looking at a Classic, Kid.","It's shot in CinemaScope, it's big on pizazz, it's packed with bold color schemes, the stage lights appear straight out of a dream, it's big one minute and quiet the next, and every song and tune will replay in your head days after it's all over. No, you're not in the 1950s, and no, you're not in Kansas anymore. This is the present-day reality. So forget about those loud action movies with no respect for the stage, La La Land proves what can and should be done with the long lost art that is the moving picture.The joyful musical genre has been in the Hollywood cemetery for too long now, but even rarer now is a musical with entirely original music in an entirely original story, which director Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) achieves with expert choreography. While he may give Southern California a bit too overly glamorous of a view with no dark edge, he still recaptures the same zest of West Side Story while cranking the spectacle up a notch. It's always a challenge for any serious director to stage a film where everyone breaks out into song without it oozing Disney Channel cheese, but Damien Chazelle has done it!Within Chazelle's cinematic recreation of Southern California, he fastens our seat belts through the bumpy relationship between two artists over the course of four long seasons, starting at the heat of Christmas. One is a ruby-red aspiring actress who cannot land an audition, and thus must serve coffee under a careless manager to make ends meet. The other is a Fred Astaire-Dooley Wilson mash-up whose fast fingers command jazz on the piano, no matter what his boss wants him to play. After they first meet over road rage at rush hour, these distracted minds find that destiny has forced them together with coincidental run-ins day after day. Everything after that is as pure and classic as dancing under a full moon.Once we learn about what these two have in common, boy is it the beginning of a beautiful friendship! He wants to revive Jazz as a modern art form, but she cannot stand listening to it, and this subject alone stems all the other conflicts that these two share over the course of a year. It is a pleasure to see the ups and downs of their romance, even if the other people in their lives are treated by the screenwriter as if they don't even matter.Yet it's not the supporting cast who helps us to understand their relationship, but the numbers that project their thoughts onto the moment. On their first formal meeting, she hears his piano playing as lit by a single spotlight, as if she's glancing into his own little world. On second formal meeting, they tap dance in front of a skyline at twilight. On the first date, they are swept off their feet—literally, to a dance against the stars in a planetarium. On the tenth date, they sing an Oscar-worthy duet. As time goes by, the dream of making it to the top of the world in Paris quickly diminishes. Her tears swell up along with the audiences'; I'll even admit I choked up as well, and I'm a man.This wide variety of tone in music is plentiful yet wisely spare, celebrating the history of cinema magic while wishing the best for its future. Yet also like the oldies it writes its love to, there are one too many white players in the production. There are two African Americans cast, but as dancers on the pier who say not a word, just as blacks were stereotyped in that golden age of Hollywood. If this production was less focused on making a musical spectacular and more focused on showing care and attention to today's media-frenzied audience, then there would have been a better likelihood for this to surpass those repetitive comic book movies at the box office.I sincerely hope for the day when people return to their senses and offer their money to movies because of their cinematic quality other than their branding. Considering how much music is now taking over our culture, we could use that reminder of how much music raises our self-esteem when times are hard. After seeing what La La Land can do with both old and new styles of filmmaking, I can absolutely assess that I love musicals all over again! Therefore, I encourage everyone to go see this magical delight to raise the spirits for 2017. After all, tomorrow is another day!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Not an original story but a masterfully told one,"I went to see this by myself today and boy did I cry like a baby.Being a massive fan of Whiplash, I had huge expectations for this film which were all somehow exceeded. La La Land's tone contrasts strongly with Chazelle's previous masterpiece, but it still has everything from beautiful cinematography, solid script and of course error-less directing. The story has been told thousands of times before (cant say more without spoiling it), but it never once felt like a replication of anything.What made it special for me however was how real it felt. You might disagree since characters break out singing and dancing all the time, which of course does not happen in real life. The long takes combined with staging and lighting makes it feel a lot more like a musical performance than a movie. But as do all great films, this one brings out each viewer's own personal story and all of its raw emotions.The acting is perfect. This is the best I have seen from Emma Stone, although at times I still think Ryan Gosling managed to outshine her a little bit.Last but not least, I cannot write this review without mentioning the scores. From my humble experience with films from the last few years, I would say no one understands music better than Chazelle. Nothing is there without serving a purpose for the story. And damn, he has such good taste!Can't wait to see what Damien Chazelle does next! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"Takes your heart out to play it like a piano, and does that just right","In a sense, creating perfect films and perfect relationships is a similar task. You just start with the best, and then simply keep it up, never compromising, not a single mistake, not a single wrong step. In a sense, it's a technical task: follow these rules - and you are bound to succeed.However, simply perfect is just too simple. Too plain. When you come to expect the perfection, you start taking it for granted, and even the perfect things lose their shine and become kinda dull. But how to create something perfect if perfect itself won't cut it? The answer is: you just have to wing it, turning your heart into an antenna and listening to what it's telling you.La La Land does just that. And, technically, what it does isn't perfect at all. The opening scene is way too cheesy and orchestrated, the dissonance between the people and their song is tiny, but stingingly apparent. And you're already bracing yourself for another hyper-hyped ultra-colored hymn to itself. At that point, the film's all but a future disappointment.But the perfect relationships are not a sunny day on a loop - what's more important is being able to make it up for the flaws and turn them into the details you'll eventually love as well. So, after having overplayed the bravado at first, the film becomes softer and more delicate, not miming its song, however perfectly, but finding its own voice, honest and sincere. A voice in which Mia and Sebastian speak to each other. At moments gruff, at moments insecure - but ultimately telling the most true story there is.Right here is where most other participants take the smooth road to an inevitable happy ending. And the summer in La La Land is sweet and promising enough to deliver just that. But will the technically perfect thing be really perfect? Or even a sunny day could get pale if not the clouds and rain to be its counterpart? So the summer is bound to turn into fall, and, once inevitable, the prospect of a happy ending vanishes like a sad pipe smoker's dream.But that's when we're hooked with no way back. From that point on, we want to listen to the story, no second thoughts, no distractions, there's only us and the storyteller. Like children who stopped squabbling and all want to know if the prince eventually finds his fair lady. Our emotions are already at stake, and the elegance with which La La Land took them out of our pocket is almost illegal. The thief doesn't even conceal himself, playing our hearts openly, and it's tempting to stop playing along and call the police. After all, the emotional manipulation is indeed a crime, even when it's so sublimely carried out.Well, if you still had strength to resist, the last shreds of it fall when Ms Stone takes the lead. And it's not just her ability to act or sing, which was out of question a long time ago. It's how she takes the razor sharp blade of emotions concealed within the script, and pulls it out in one impeccable move, like King Arthur once did. And oh boy, don't you just start shivering at that moment, so bright she shines.And just after that, it becomes really inevitable. The mastermind of this brilliant spectacle, Mr Chazelle, might be young, but when he's behind the wheel of a story he wrote himself, he doesn't miss. Every single romantic nonsense that we used to laugh about - like ""and she felt as if those five years have never passed, as if she was right there, in that quiet restaurant at Christmas eve, her eyes on him, as if nothing else existed"" - becomes alive in his hands, and he literally takes us on a journey others could only describe. The feeling you experience at that moment... it's pure magic, something that not only makes you forgive the pompous intro, but makes you realize that it was the only right start for something that led you where you are now. And that's when your feeling is finally complete.Technically, La La Land isn't without a flaw. And if I was a grumpy old fart, I might've groaned on about it for a bit. About Ryan Gosling's questionable singing, or the plot's lack of complexity, or the ending being not what we might want it to be. But that doesn't really matter, after all, it's just technicalities. What does matter is what the film emanates - love. Love for art, love for those who dare to dream and dare to follow the dreams, who dare to be open and true. Love for life itself. The kind of love that shows the passion of the person whose heart that love flows out of. And these feelings don't just show off or simply graze you. They reach out to you. They ARE THERE for you.And for letting me take that love as my own, La La Land, thank you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
It gets better every time,"I loved this movie for so many reasons but ultimately I love how much more I can gain from the depth and thought put into the movie every time I watch it. From the block colours of all the outfits and set to the symbolic use of every song. Each individual musical piece isn't just placed there like a Disney princess movie does, it always has a purpose to portray a feeling or moment that can't be captured in just words and I loved that about the film, even the smaller more insignificant songs actually hold so much meaning when they get incorporated in the big finale song.

"For dying jazz, brilliant choreography , beautiful cinematography and those who dream","La la land isn't just a movie, it's an experience to remember.Damien Chazelle's musical romance is a dazzling beauty that will never be forgotten.The movie is about the love affair between a jazz pianist and an actress who are struggling hard to chase their dreams. Through the cycle of seasons, their love affair develops and their lives too keep on moving but their dreams could hardly be fulfilled in the city of stars.Finally as Sebastian starts to settle while Mia could make even that much,they are ripped apart each after their own dreams.The movie has moments to remember : the first time when Mia and Sebastian met and through some beautiful dance moves they exchange what they feel about each other ,it was o so beautiful. Another favourite moment of mine was when Mia saw Sebastian five years later , both being equally successful then, and Sebastian played their love note over the piano and Mia imagined how their life had been if they both would've been together.The cinematography and the set design here was something to remember.Talking about the screenplay,unlike most other romantic dramas,La la land races away in 120 minutes.The music was excellent with meaningful lyrics.'City of stars', being the special one.Finally La la land leaves with a message : To chase dreams , one must make a sacrifice.To handle so much of things in a fashionable way, Damien Chazelle must be applauded for a wonderful direction.In two hours, La la land offers more than you would expect.Almost everything you can expect from a film.This musical masterpiece will be remembered even in years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Whimsical Musical with cool hair colour Emma and Mr Stud Muffin Ryan,"La La Land. What can I say? Well, first off, let's make it abundantly clear to EVERYONE that I do NOT LIKE musicals. Hate them. There is one exception, Grease...and maybe The Rocky Horror Picture Show...cause I liked the songs. I only went to see La La Land cause it won a heap of awards and has been nominated for everything so I figured it cant be all that bad... The first 10 minutes for me was Painful, very Painful...did I mention I Don't LIKE MUSICALS? I hate that random song and dance, it just doesn't make sense to me... So I sat there in the theatre watching this painful singing and dancing by random strangers and then Emma Stone showed up. I like Emma Stone. She does that slightly quirky/confused thing really well and she's pretty. Then she started singing...umm Emma you are definitely an actor, but then she started dancing, OK, not too bad, this girl can move. Then Ryan Gosling showed up. I love you Ryan Gosling. I am sure there is nothing that you can do wrong. WRONG. Ryan Gosling is okay with the dancing but please Ryan, do NOT sing, ever again. E.V.E.R. After lots of gazing into each other's eyes Emma and Ryan formed a connection. I would like that connection with Ryan. He's good at that I-think-I'm-falling-in-love-with-you gazing thing. So slowly I started to relax and start enjoying the film. The singing got better (Emma, NOT Ryan...) and the dancing was great. The old time romance was lovely to watch. This film had a great story line. Two wanna-be's in Los Angeles, who meet, fall in love, but ultimately just want to ""make it"" in Hollywood. That is their goal. They just happen to have bumped into each other in the meantime. It was only in the last 15 minutes of the film that I decided that I LIKED the film. It is one film that I can confidently say actually doesn't leave anything ""hanging"". You don't walk out of the film thinking ""but what happened with....bla bla bla"". All lose ends get tied up and not that many films manage to do that these days. So that is why I liked the film - because it all made sense. Yes it was set up as an old fashioned musical with some mobile phone text messages thrown in (yes, those mobile phones reminded you that you weren't watching an OLD film) and the film I thought was very arty too with lighting and scenery. I'm glad that I saw it and you should probably see it too. You can probably wait for it on DVD or TV, as it's a musical folks and I Don't LIKE MUSICALS!!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Ingenious or cinematic sacrilege?,"It's clear to understand why countless five-star reviews extravagantly blazon the film poster for La La Land, as La La Land is essentially a film critic's dream. It's a film about film itself created specifically for film lovers, and after a career of dissecting and analyzing an innumerable amount of them; it must be a certain thrill for a critic to witness one being deconstructed before their very eyes.La La Land first seizes a classic film genre and contorts it, re imagining the Old Hollywood musical by juxtaposing a contemporary Los Angeles setting with the heightened whimsical reality of those early 20th century productions, straddling the two contrasting eras in such an expert manner that they somehow miraculously harmonize. The musical sequences are delightfully executed, with exhilarating Baz Luhrmann-esque camera swoops capturing charming choreography amongst sumptuous set designs that are doubtlessly littered, Tarantino-like, with suitable film references. It's near impossible not to be enraptured by this, as La La Land's infectiously joyful tone combined with its sublime filmmaking aspects produce a positively captivating experience, reminding us in a modernized and relevant sense exactly why the musical genre is so beloved, and producing a refreshing antidote to the relentless cynicism that permeates our recent culture.Suitably, its narrative is the traditional scenario of a love story between two struggling artists and dreamers, with Emma Stone's coffee shop barista Mia enduring multiple brutal auditions in the hope of movie stardom, while Ryan Gosling's Seb is on a one-man mission to change the modern perception of jazz and regain its glory. They're befitting casting, with Gosling's stoic charm and Stone's buoyant persona hearkening to that specific bygone era, while their wry conversational wit simultaneously grounds them in the present-day backdrop. Also appropriate is the simplistic nature of their developing romance, proving the strength of La La Land and all its components by producing such impactful scenes from these conventional and exhausted romantic comedy tropes. These scenes culminate in a transcendent moment as Seb and Mia spontaneously float and ballroom dance amongst the stars of an observatory, conceiving a surreal sequence that sincerely embodies the beauty and magic of cinema.After reaching such soaring heights of razzle-dazzle-ness, it was perhaps inevitable that La La Land would ultimately fizzle out, and in an act of rather unexpected cruelty, the enchanting development the film has so effectively accomplished is dismantled before the viewer's eyes. The somewhat jarring introduction of Seb's old friend Keith (John Legend) is the catalyst that spurs this sudden shift of tone, as Seb accepts his soulless job offer despite a lasting desire to own a jazz bar. Thereafter Seb and Mia's aspirations for themselves and one another are continually dashed and dampened, their passions gradually engulfing their passions for each other while the film adopts an unforeseen gloomy essence of realism.It's where motifs from director Damien Chazelle's last feature Whiplash (2014), a savage observation of artistic ambition, are introduced as Chazelle essentially hijacks this established genre with his personal beliefs and developing directorial trademarks. In retrospect the foreshadowing is evident: an earlier scene of Seb and Mia strolling through the Warner Brothers' studio back lot allows the viewer a peak behind the cinematic curtain before La La Land eventually takes them behind it's own. Nevertheless, without the sheen of Old Hollywood charm the simplistic nature of the plot is ultimately exposed as the unoriginal, cliché-ridden Fame-esque narrative it actually is, with its discussions on hopes and dreams now obtaining a level of triteness. Additionally, the approach is neither authentic nor hard-hitting enough to be entirely effective, instead striking an unsatisfying middle ground that fails to fulfill the potential of its inspired and intriguing concept. Gratefully, the film somewhat salvages itself by its culmination, reintroducing it's much missed homages with a beautifully performed sequence that in it's own unusual bittersweet way depicts the power film is capable of and is an ode to cinema itself.Indeed, La La Land is a film about film itself created specifically for film lovers, but its exact assessment of the subject is something for the viewer to ponder. While there's undoubtedly an ingenious aspect of deconstructing a departed genre for a modern age, there's simultaneously an element of cynicism and cinematic sacrilege. In a pessimistic society and a film and television landscape that frequently reflect that, and it's in this respect La La Land would ironically be more subversive if it retained its jubilant spirit, is it truly necessary or beneficial for the audience to glimpse beyond this cinematic curtain? For a few hours can ignorance be bliss and can the sanctity of film be sacred while the audience resides, temporarily at least, in the whimsical escapism of 'La La Land'?",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
For Love at Art,"What better way to use my first review for this wonderful movie. La La Land is the new project of Damien Chazelle, director who followed when he showed a Hollywood of what was capable with his exciting Whiplash. And it's that, if we talk about Chazelle, we talk about passion, and the love he brings loaded on video every time he plays a camera. We're facing one of the best cinematographic works of recent years, inviting to dream, love, singing, dancing... And for this, they put us in the context of the two protagonists, Mia Dolan played by Emma Stone and Sebastian Wilder, played by Ryan Gosling. This endearing pair of artists have already worked seamlessly on previous tapes, performing the roles of an aspiring actress and a jazz pianist who end up falling in love after being in various situations in the city of Los Angeles. From the premise, which we have heard of her a thousand times, we can find in this story also miles of reasons to know that it is not the typical romantic comedy. Shops that deal with a special musical from the outset, in the that each melody fulfills both the sound perfection and the development of the characters. We assimilate that the soundtrack shares from the beginning, a ligature with each protagonist, and that isn't in a euphoric moment of the jazz pianist, the music creates more euphoria still. Each scene is pristine, bright, pure and visually beautiful. It has a classic tonality that honors the great tapes that made the history as ''Casablanca'' (Michael Curtiz, 1942), ''Singin' in the Rain'' (Gene Kelly & Stanley Donen, 1952), ''Rebel Without a Cause'' (Nicholas Ray, 1955), or ''The Young Girls of Rochefort'' (Jacques Demy, 1967) and many more, which have a direct influence on this film. For this, the director proposes a photograph that also shines or degrades depending on the state of the characters, with a use of bright and radiant color in much of the film, in moments of happiness, desire to succeed, euphoria, in the pursuit of dreams, and some more mature, dark, in the conflicts between the protagonists, in their cadences as artists or in a less ideal future than at the beginning. Around this circle of genius left the music and photography, we have two great Hollywood actors in the role of these artists, who completely fill that gap we need. We could no longer imagine another that wasn't Emma Stone in this role. There is a great job behind all of this, and yet once you don't destabilize by a good dance canteen, I seem to be a positive point to the cause, since you grant realism to every scene however ideal. These are recurrent in the film, since Chazelle wants to tell us the sacrifices (in this case love) that have to end up making our dreams come true. The memories that only the characters have in them, or use the melancholy with all the aforementioned resources, makes this tape the transmission of love that sits, in a way not tacky, with versatility, gives the same musicality to the dialogues. This perfect couple, with a relationship from outside totally normal, is also complete inside, as happens in reality.

This film is so lovely...,"I may have noticed that this film won the Oscars, so I'll write a review about it. The characters of this film are listed below:Mia is number one in the La La Land character list, because I love women and girls. Her face looks pretty, although I hate it when she argues with others.Sebastian comes next in La La Land, because his romantic fascination for Mia is high. However, I don't like it when he's been accused for raping people.I'm a little tired to continue writing for now - and I don't want to know much about the other La La Land characters.

Fast food with very good ornaments,"The art direction is fantastic, the choreography was very nice, the camera direction superb, the montage amazing, but at the end, what can I say, a very poor script well told, the story is so plane, so basic, so cliché. My first though was, typical Hollywood, fast food very well dressed. you know, it is like a transformer movie with terrible script but with magnificent effects. Same here, the story line is so dull, but it's told with an exquisite art direction to cover how shallow it really is. I think is a good movie, with a lot of work behind.

Adequate as far as musicals go.,"I'm a huge musicals fan and I went into this film expecting something quite special. There was so much build-up. So much hype. The opening sequence was incredible, despite my not being able to understand the lyrics most of the time. The dance sequence was a joy to watch. So I sat back and was ready to be impressed. It didn't happen.Basically a romance, the story was passable. Ryan Gosling's character being a jazz zealot ass-wipe made him difficult to like. It fell into a massive hole about two-thirds in where the audience drifted off. The ending? Well it was just awful.The singing was very average. Neither Gosling or Stone have great singing voices.The music, which, let's face it, is quite important in a musical, was a major disappointment.I loved the dancing, the locations, the use of vivid colors and many other things but these weren't enough to offset the lackluster music and singingThe people watched this film may not have seen the classic musicals from decades ago. Perhaps that's why the IMDb score is so high. I hope that La La Land starts a resurgence in the musical genre. If it does, they will have to be much better than this effort.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Emma Stone is a brilliant actor and really showcases her talents in La La Land.And while there's nothing wrong with Gosling's performance, his character isn't exactly written to be as emotional and expressive, so it's fine be me.Usually I don't really like musicals.

Atrocious,"This is simply the worst 'musical' I have ever seen. It was clear to my wife and I, about 30 minutes into this, that the actors, director and composer where too young to remember, or too young to understand the old musicals, and just how much talent went into those productions.The music was dreary and unmemorable, the story was uneven and made little sense. I think Emma Stone is a delightful actress, but this was a huge overreach for her. Ryan Gosling was stiff and bland (as he is most of the time).My advice to people who gave this a 10, please go watch:SINGIN' IN THE RAIN -- WEST SIDE STORY -- THE WIZARD OF OZ -- THE SOUND OF MUSIC -- CABARET -- MARY POPPINS -- A STAR IS BORN -- MY FAIR LADY -- AN American IN Paris -- MEET ME IN ST.

"""A Stellar Journey Through Dreams and Reality""","*La La Land*, directed by Damien Chazelle, is a mesmerizing blend of romance, jazz, and the aspirations of two hopeful artists, set against the vibrant backdrop of Los Angeles. Released in 2016, this film has earned critical acclaim and captured the hearts of audiences worldwide.The film follows the love story of Mia (Emma Stone), an aspiring actress, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a dedicated jazz musician. Both are struggling to achieve their dreams in a city where competition is fierce, and success is elusive. As their romance blossoms, they face the harsh realities of following their passions and the sacrifices they must make to do so.One of the most striking elements of *La La Land* is its visual style. Chazelle and cinematographer Linus Sandgren paint a beautifully vibrant picture reminiscent of classic Hollywood musicals, with sweeping camera movements and dazzling colors that capture the essence of Los Angeles. The opening scene, featuring an elaborate dance number on a traffic-filled freeway, sets the tone for the film's exuberance and creativity.The score, composed by Justin Hurwitz, is equally captivating. The music seamlessly melds with the narrative, and the original songs-most notably ""City of Stars""-have a haunting quality that lingers long after the credits roll. The film's musical numbers are not just performances but integrated into the storytelling, revealing character emotions and aspirations.Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling deliver standout performances, showcasing their talents as both actors and singers. Stone brings vulnerability and depth to Mia, capturing the struggles of aspiring artists with authenticity. Gosling's portrayal of Sebastian is equally compelling, as he embodies the passion and dedication that drives his character. Their chemistry is palpable, making their love story both enchanting and poignant.At its core, *La La Land* is a meditation on dreams, love, and the sacrifices that come with ambition. It illustrates the tension between personal aspirations and relationships, often leaving viewers questioning what sacrifices are worth making in pursuit of one's dreams.

A Beautiful Film,"La La Land is a dazzling, beautifully crafted love letter to Hollywood musicals, brimming with vibrant colors, breathtaking cinematography, and stunning performances from Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. The chemistry between the leads is undeniable, and their shared journey through the highs and lows of chasing dreams feels both magical and deeply personal.However, beneath its charming exterior lies a bittersweet core that makes the film all the more powerful. It's not just a love story-it's a story of sacrifice, missed opportunities, and the harsh realities of life. The final act, in particular, is emotionally devastating, reminding us that not all dreams and relationships can coexist.

Best film in 2016,"When i first saw the trailer, i didn't think i was gonna love it. I don't like musical film, but this film makes me look it in the positive ways.
First, the plot was awesome. It was the love story between Mia- a coffee shop servant pursuing to be an actress and Sebastian- a musician with the desire to save the Jazz an open his own bar. This love story was the combination between reality and romantic. And it encourages everyone to pursue and achieve their ambitions.
The performances and combination between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone was brilliant. They really suit the character. Quite sad that Ryan didn't win the Oscar like Emma did
The music was the best. It brings the film to the highest mood!
And i think it deserves the Academy award for best pictures more than Moonlight.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"La La LandFinally, Hollywood has made a film that celebrates France's stuttering sailors.Oops, apparently the land in the title actually references to tinsel town it self.Mia (Emma Stone) is a budding actress whose hapless life is constantly intersecting with an aspiring jazz musician, Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), who would rather open his own club than play in his jazz-fusion band (John Legend).A relationship eventfully forms between the entertainers and they each help the other attain their dream. However their success comes at the expensive of their unique bond.A keenly choreographed homage to old Hollywood musicals set in the modern era with its contemporary inconveniences, this song and dance routine may have a familiar narrative but its reinterpretation is astute; albeit saccharine at times.Career defining performers from both leads and a decent array of melodies further enhance this charmer.Incidentally, insurance doesn't cover injuries obtained dancing in the streets.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

This is a beautiful film with great performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. They are both extremely likable in this film and their chemistry is great. The music is extraordinary and dare I say it one of the best film scores ever. Damien Chazelle is truly a poetic genius and I believe on track to be one of the greatest film directors ever (I also love his 2014 film Whiplash). In regards to the 14 Academy Award nominations I see why many think that's too many nominations but when you look into detail at what they were nominated for it does make sense because this film, at least in my opinion, is very well put together. The sound nominations they received, for example, were deserved (granted I never thought they would win them anyway) because they do have to blend a lot of sounds together with the singing and dancing, and that can actually be very tricky especially with the bigger numbers. The plot is simple but the way it's told is very unique and enjoyable. All around an amazing film in every aspect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Sometimes more is better than less.,"Okay so. I hate when people start reviews that way BUT this is a bit of a take a breath moment and keep it real. Sometimes in cinema a director/producer/writer etc will try to reinvent a genre. A revival if you like to make something popular again. Horror has been reinvented for generations, as have westerns and periodically, musicals. Unfortunately this movie will not revive the movie musical. As pleasant and mostly well meaning as this is, after hearing mostly positive reviews I walked into the cinema with warm expectations for a couple of hours of guilty pleasure enjoyment and walked out at the end in silence with the rest of the audience in a "" that was quite good "" kind of way. The story is not all engaging.The songs are not overly memorable and the pacing is fairly pretentious. It's a musical that is in denial about BEING a musical.I went to see an early run showing of Les Miserables in an IMAX cinema when it was released and the movie being applauded at the end because people had a fantastic experience. The mostly Luke warm experience of this with the occasional vaguely exciting dance number and the expressive quiet of the audience afterwards leaves nothing really left to say except.

"Must see, for basically everyone ♥","If you haven't seen it yet or the hype hadn't convinced you  just believe me now when I say - You need to go to the cinema ASAP. Just one warning though; You won't be able to get the music out of your head. IMDb sums up the movie in one sentence, but there is so much more to it, although I have to say "" A jazz pianist falls for an aspiring actress in Los Angeles. "" is the only way to describe the plot without giving away any of the important scenes. So let's start, shall we? The movie begins with the most cliché musical scene I've encountered in a long time, but it sets the mood for what's to come being everything else but cliché. Sure, here we have a case of a (kinda) corny love story, but it is full of surprise, fraught with intelligent conversations and witty comebacks and most importantly, has an open end, to open up a whole new world for your imagination. Our protagonists are Mia and Sebastian played by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, the best movie couple they could have found for these characters. The seem so harmonious together, it's sad at the end of the movie you have to discover, this isn't real life. Also the music, oh have I mentioned the music? I've never been a fan of Jazz in fact, I'd thought I didn't like it very much. Turns out I've just hadn't listened to the right stuff. Another thing that convinced me is that the soundtrack doesn't only contain jazz, but also beautiful piano tracks. Sure one might argue, they aren't the type for musicals, but this one seems to be different in so many ways. The whole arrangement of different styles within the movie makes it drop-dead gorgeous to watch, even if you don't like the story. If you haven't figured it by now, it's a 10/10 for me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

A must-see film for anyone who aspires to something greater in their life.,"In a world where people worship everything and value nothing, I have found that I value the many messages present within La La Land (2016). While simultaneously shining a harsh light on the hypocrisy of Hollywood and showing how our dreams and passions move us to make tough life decisions, I found myself deeply moved by the narrative presented within this film, not only as a lover of movies but as a creative artist myself. This film is for the dreamers. It's for the people who never give up in pursuing what they want out of life. It's for those who have a talent screaming to be noticed by others.Aside from literally being the best musical I've seen in nearly more than a decade (Chicago (2002) is the only recent one that comes to mind), what I found most impressive about this film is that it is only the second directed by Damien Chazelle. For those who may have missed it, his previous work, Whiplash (2014), was an extreme look at the commitment a musician will take just to be a part of something bigger. With this in mind, we find that Chazelle has a passion for music that is easily grasped through his use of expert cinematography.Much like The Young Girls of Rochefort (1967), La La Land makes me feel like the world would be a much better place if people sang and danced at the drop of a hat (or stop of a car). But even with the almost cliche ""romantic comedy"" beginning, where La La Land differs from these films is the depth that it explores the relationships between two dreamers. While we always want our life partners to succeed in their dreams, it can be difficult to find a balance between somewhat contrasting goals.A must-see film for anyone who aspires to something greater in their life, I give La La Land 5.0 stars out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

You get real city shots and gorgeously painted sets. I've watched this movie 7 times and counting, and constantly catch myself singing Justin Hurwitz's incredibly composed music.

A Musical Disappointment!!,"La La Land could have been an enjoyable movie if it weren't for its failed attempt at being a musical. A musical can be captivating when the music, dancing, and voices of the actors are top-notch. Unfortunately, this movie falls short in this regard, making it difficult to appreciate the genre it's meant to represent.If this film had been a straightforward drama, my rating would be higher. However, as a musical, it fails to deliver, which leads me to rate it poorly. The music is forgettable, and the singing voices of the lead actors are unpleasant. Why didn't they cast actors who could sing? There are plenty of talented singers who could have done justice to the musical elements.Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone deliver solid performances, but they are not suitable for a musical. Watching the movie becomes a struggle whenever they start singing. Their voices are grating, making it a painful experience for the audience's ears.I couldn't finish watching La La Land because it became unbearably boring halfway through. Reading spoilers about the ending was more than enough for me. If this film had been a pure drama without the musical aspect, it would have been significantly better. Or they could have just changed the lead actors and, found better songs and choreography!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
One for the Romantics,"We went and saw La La Land as a baby step on the long road to recovery following 'the Incident'. A journey starts with a single step. Unless you are driving. Although most folk walk to a car.... But what if that initial walk is away from your destination? I don't know. I don't care. Just put it in for the pedants.The movie is about a struggling jazz musician. No surprises there. Is there any other kind? The only surprise is that he doesn't seem to be a smack freak. He plays Christmas music in a place where he has to give himself tips. He is unhappy. Fortunately the Gozza has a permanent preternaturally bleak look about him.There is also a struggling actress, played by the Stoner who is good at crying and this is fortunate because her life as a struggling actress is as potholed as a Port Moresby road. Mebbe they've improved. Dunno.The movie starts off with a big production number that is reminiscent of a Pepsi max ad with bucket loads of young, wild (yet oddly responsible) young people dancing and singing and generally making the best of a bad situation. In my experience, both as an observer and an historical actual young person, this just doesn't happen without alcohol and drugs and almost always ends badly with one vomit-filled shoe, bruises, and no underwear. I hate Pepsi Max ads and their ilk.Anyway they meet and there are production numbers and jazz concerts and auditions and successes and failures before they both became wildly successful. Most of the music was unfamiliar to me. I did recognise A-Ha and Flock of Seagulls but they were peripheral. I am not proud of this.They fall in love. Those who wish to see MacGuffies will be disappointed.There are lot of flash backs and these had me for one confused, presenting alternate endings and suchlike. If you nod off, you'll go insane with an absolute hydra of possibility.But we did enjoy the music and had I been a toe-tapper, these mini digits would've been tapping out a machine-gun beat.There is dancing too, but Fred'n Ginger expectations will be dashed against the rocks of despair. Still, they are better'n me although I have a hip flexor injury, and am off the turps.We walked out thinking that it hadn't been a waste of a seniors discount.

La La Land was quite realistic for an original musical but also fantastic in some sequences,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who saw it before and said it was okay. The movie seems to want to be both realistic and fantasy-laden as evidenced by the location shots for the former and the more imaginative set designs for the latter. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are the leads and they both seem believable enough playing a real-life couple trying to live their dreams and also to please each other but it seems they can't do both. The original songs are pretty entertaining and their voices are, well, serviceable for their characters. Part of me did wonder if the praise was worth it but by the end, it brought a smile to me face even if the ending was not a ""happily ever after"" one. So that's a recommendation for La La Land.

anti-Chinese sentiments in a movie that could be good,"The movie itself isn't bad. It could be a good movie. What strikes me is the anti-Chinese sentiments that is repeatedly expressed in this movie. The French-Anglo director Damien Chazelle is obviously racist against the Chinese.First, he made Ryan Gosling tell the audience that nobody would ever want Chinese coffee. Later on, Emma Stone's boyfriend who's supposed to portray a real jerk, shows that he does business with Chinese people. He also tells that the Chinese is building a bridge (which is controversial) as a hidden political message to the movie viewer.This Frenchman obviously has a lot of hidden anti-Chinese frustration and tries to use La La Land as racist anti-Chinese propaganda for his own hidden political racist views against ethnic Chinese people.The movie's story itself wasn't bad and it was quite well executed but ruined by the butt-hurt personal political frustration of this racist French-Anglo director/writer, Damien Chazelle. It's no wonder that an Asian Man-White woman couple is the only couple that has been banned from showing in this movie.If the movie wasn't politically motivated, I would give it a higher score.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

"Overspilling with artistic originality, class and wit, ""La La Land"" promises to be one of the greatest films of this generation","""La La Land"" is utterly wonderful; a remarkable blend of romantic idealism with the harshness of reality, Damien Chazelle illustrates the Los Angeles setting delightfully, capturing the everyday difficulties of life within love and the external challenges it entails with sharp confidence yet absolute serenity. Exploding with beautiful visual contrasts, expertly demonstrating the director's vision of the romanticised average dreamer's lifestyle, ""La La Land"" emerges as undeniably one of the defining movies of the decade, if not the century. And if not that, the new pinnacle of both the romantic and musical genres alike.All singing, all dancing, ""La La Land"" boasts some of the best choreographed dance scenes in popular culture of recent memory, and huge credit is deserved to choreographer Mandy Moore who has managed to orchestrate multiple intensely exhilarating movements that so beautifully complement Chazelle's chosen one-shot style. Collectively, the filmmakers have successfully managed to transport the viewers right back to the classic ages of Hollywood: to the era of musicals, playing with nostalgia so respectfully as head cinematographer Linus Sandgren provides us with shots of such magnificence, it truly is a modern art film of unprecedented prosperity.The film contains a glorious soundtrack, written by Chazelle's Harvard University friend Justin Hurwitz, who manages to grasp the fantastical nature of the film excellently. The songs remain resonant after the credits have rolled, each of them classics in the making, which is exactly what one would hope for in a fresh new musical.Everything in this movie conjugates to form this masterful outcome with extraordinary spontaneity; nothing ever feels rushed or forced as each scene flows from one to the next naturally, driven by the dynamic character force and chemistry between lead actors Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Stone shines the brightest, proudly demonstrating her ability to perform, sing and dance throughout, thus completely nailing each scene she is in. She feels perfectly fitted for this part, handpicked by Chazelle after he saw her in ""Cabaret"". Their respective commitment to these roles is also highly commendable, Gosling went through intensive training and learned jazz piano in just three months, and listening to the outcome, it is rather difficult to believe judging by how eloquently he plays. Both look like they are enjoying themselves immensely, dancing and singing with such fluency and passion, which reflects onto the screen sensationally.And that is ultimately what makes this film so great: it's the dedication of the people involved to making something that one can simply enjoy and appreciate in its own right. It is easy to see that Chazelle has been dreaming of doing this project all his life, and the product of his fantasies is an outstanding spectacle of pure joy; a genuine heartfelt translation of stage onto screen done with such admirable grace, it has certainly earned every shred of praise it gets, and much, much more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Uncomplicated joy,"Here's a confession: I am a somewhat nostalgic person. When I hear a tune by Ella Fitzgerald or Frank Sinatra, I think to myself: what happened to this kind of uplifting, well-made, wonderful music? The same goes for musicals. The pure, uncomplicated joy expressed by the classic Hollywood musicals seems to be a thing of the past. It was an expression of postwar optimism, when people yearned for escapist entertainment. In the cinema, all they wanted to see and hear were nice-sounding tunes, dazzling choreographies, colourful set designs, and happily smiling characters. Later on, as society changed, the social dramas, the war movies and the psychological thrillers made the musicals look a bit silly.The musical didn't really die, but the happy-go-lucky feeling of those classic Hollywood musicals did. Recreating it seemed impossible. Until La La Land came along.The film captures a spirit of carefree optimism that nobody expects in 2017. The title, the cinematography, the boy-meets-girl-story, the Tinseltown setting, the references to classic films: it all fits perfectly together. In this sense, La La Land is a wonderful movie.On the other hand, it is just that: a modern-day recreation of the classic Hollywood musical. It's good, really enjoyable and fun to watch, but it's not monumental, thought-provoking or deeply emotional. I enjoyed watching it, but the hype in the media and the record number of award nominations are perhaps a bit overdone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
La La Land beautifully unites Hollywood and the Everyman (Audio),"Our Hollywood critics, Ann Elder and Les Roberts adore this film from start to finish! The opening scene has beautiful cinematography, fabulous dancing and a great musical number, and these elements are carried brilliantly throughout the rest of the film. They think it is a fresh look at all the Hollywood musicals of the 20th century, and adore the way it portrays the ""Hollywood outsider."" The musical numbers are great, although Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are not great singers. This casting is intentional though, because it shows the common man's pursuit of Hollywood. Emma Stone absolutely owns this film, and Ryan Gosling gives a stellar performance. Les was blown away by the incredible dancing; Ann and Les hope to see a revival of this kind of original musical.For more of their review, listen to the podcast here: https://www.thefrontporchpeople.com/greenlightreviews/la-la-land",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
The Best Picture Winner (for 30 seconds),"""La La Land"" is exactly what its whimsical and upbeat title would entail: a masterfully directed, wonderfully delightful, visually vibrant, and painstakingly realistic musical. The film's tremendous success and acclaim may leave some disappointed that are expecting the next great genre film. Although this film is not excellent, it certainly sings a catchy memorable tune.This is one of the few films I have seen that made me wish people could just randomly break out into a synchronized song and dance. The music is perfect for the magical vibrancy of the dance sequences. The director, Damien Chazelle, was definitely Oscar worthy especially by mimicking Alejandro González Iñárritu's tracking shots in ""Birdman"" and ""The Revenant"" -- tracking shots done right are always deserving of an Oscar. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone together create a convincing romance full of humor, hope, charm, and blistering sadness. The most surprising thing about ""La La Land"" is its handling of themes such as dreams vs. reality, and how much it takes to chase those dreams. The filmmakers were not afraid to take risks with the story. Those risks paid off because the movie was bitterly realistic when it could have easily been cliché. The only problem with the film is that it took awhile for any kind of conflict/drama to emerge resulting in a semi dragged out narrative.For me, ""La La Land"" was as good as a musical could have been (musicals are my least favorite genre). I enjoyed it for what it was, and it was definitely deserving of those fourteen Oscar nominations, and six wins. It's really the only film that actually made me want to start singing and dancing at the end of it. Too bad it got Steve Harvey'd.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Mediocre at best,"I don't usually bother to write reviews but I just couldn't stand by passively on this one... This film simply does in no way, shape or form deserve above 6, and that's why I'm giving it a 1 now (it is at 8.4 currently). In a word, LLL is mediocre. The dancing and singing are poor. The plot is clichéd yet contrived. The characters are charmless and lack chemistry. The music is OK, but not great at all. The acting is alright, but just that. I could go on... The only plusses are on the technical and production sides. I thought it missed a great opportunity to tell a more important, original and uplifting story about when you don't ""make it"", even if you're good. It decided not to do so in a really forced and lazy way. I don't even know if this is a musical, a Nicholas Sparks type film or a feel good comedy. It tries to be all and is mediocre to bad at all as well as in the overall end result. The movie says nothing worth saying, is a bit depressing and very boring (which is no small feat considering it's supposed to be a musical). Well, here's the thing Hollywood: to make a great musical you need a good or fun story with great actors who are great singers and dancers. You also need at least five great compositions and choreographies. Oh, I see... you don't, because people are increasingly sheeple and stupid. All you really need is a great marketing machine... Come on people! Wake up!",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"OK, I hate all musicals,,, except this one, dammit!","Never been moved much by musicals though I've always admired those of Fred Astaire. But this movie is not some glitzy re-humanization of being rich during The Depression. It's actually almost the opposite, a musical centered on the little people striving to succeed while enduring the ups and downs of relationships and two branches of the entertainment business, one an actress, the other a jazz pianist.Thing is the two leads here, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, are not easy to picture in a romantic musical. But, without a doubt, they're an inspired choice who will make you wonder, just how much talent is there in Hollywood? It's mind-boggling to contemplate. What's more, these two fine actors are so evenly matched here that it's impossible to tell which came first, the pairing or the script. Clearly they had an uncanny grasp of the form though it's been years since there's been such a successful one.This movie so deftly navigates all sorts of truth about so many elusive things that it's not worth picking a few. Just go see it, even if you don't like musicals. It will win you over.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
La La Land is A True Definition of Cinema.,"""This is a dream: it's conflict, it's compromise, and it's very very exciting. Here's to the ones who dream."" La La Land is A True Definition of Cinema. Here's my thoughts about this magical movie:I'm in love, like really in love with this movie, because LA LA LAND is a movie which has reinforced my belief in the power of dreams. The first five minutes is like a great appetizer before you get the better main course, ONE SHOT DUDE COME ON. Gosling performance is ridiculously good, but Stone has never been better like this before (the Audition scene, GOD). Chazelle's direction is a gift for cinema, he know how to treat a scene and end a movie (Whiplash, remember?), thank God he's not one hit wonder director. Justin Hurwitz needs to get more recognition, his work is a fine art and I think people will always talk about the music of LA LA LAND. The shots and coloring is a masterwork and a feast for your eyes, bow down to Linus Sandgren and Natasha Leonnet. The final 15 minutes and the epilogue scene is breathtaking. Yes I cried, my soul left my body during this sequence because hit me on so many levels, it's so beautiful and charming and emotional.It's a love letter for people like me who adore everything about cinema, jazz, Hollywood, stunning visual, Los Angeles, musical, and dreamers. LA LA LAND made me nostalgic and yearn about something I've never experienced before, and I want it more than ever after watch this movie. Recommended to everyone who give up to pursue passion for the arts, because this movie celebrate the dreamers among us (except the pessimistic and cynical ones). Bittersweet brilliance, an instant classic, an homage to the classic era of Hollywood musical, and 2016 antidote for sure.I can't remember the last time a movie made me feel this way, deepest thanks to all who created LA LA LAND, especially for Chazelle and Hurwitz for this ambitious project, I love you both.I can talk about this movie all day long, seriously. Please do watch this one in theater, I will drag everyone I know to watch this blissful magical movie, I can't recommend it enough. Last thing to say, if you don't enjoy LA LA LAND, probably you don't deserve to be happy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Terrific,"Liked everything about it; acting, singing, dancing, direction, screenplay, etc., and it all works. Can't remember when I saw a more entertaining picture. I am a big fan of movie musicals and, strictly speaking, ""La La Land"" is a musical, with some tuneful original songs and a few dance numbers. It starts off with a production number in a highway traffic jam - right off the bat you say to yourself, ""this will be a special picture"".Midway through it switches gears into a straight romantic drama, leaving the singing and dancing behind. By that time, though, you are thoroughly invested in the story and you hardly notice. Gosling and Stone are not known as singers and dancers but they get through just fine, he with a three day growth of beard and she with a Senor-Wences-hand-puppet endearing face. Writer-Director Chazelle has put together a movie which will draw some Oscar noms come Academy Award time. A rare picture with no apparent flaws.Just saw it again and it was better the second time. The ""No"" vote crowd will be very disappointed at AA time. And, apparently, some ""No"" votes have gone to every single high rating and voted No. What the point is, I don't know, but it's very coincidental and doesn't fool all the people, to paraphrase a Republican president.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Right kind of nostalgia,"This movie has some fantastic shots in it, and it manages to bring some of the amazement you can get from watching an actual musical live. The songs are mostly not that memorable, but they're always welcome when they come. They're also spaced out in an interesting way, fitting with the emotional flow of the movie. The actors do a terrific job playing their parts.Even though I can easily get caught in nostalgia, I am also quite wary of it. This movie delves in it, but luckily it does in a way that feels thought through, and in the end it seems like it comes to terms with the fact that the present ain't so bad either. You can try to recreate the past, or you can bring the positive aspects of the past with you as you head into the future. To me, the latter is the most appealing, and it's how I felt this movie handled it.All of that said, the movie never excels. It's a nice musical with great acting, impressive shots and a nice setting - and it deserves praise for all of those things. The complete package works nicely, but it it's no great loss to miss out on this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"A film of spontaneous, colourful magic and charm","A film of spontaneous, colourful magic and charm, La La Land captivates us from the very first scene. Visually, it is spectacular. All the elements sing in harmony and coalesce together to form a beautiful artwork. It was director Damian Chazelle ('Whiplash')'s dream for many years to get this film made, and what a passionate, special film he has created. It is a treat for your eyes and ears, and especially your heart.But let's talk about that opening scene. A hundred dancers, enthusiastically and joyously dancing and singing during a traffic jam on a freeway. Chazelle doesn't wait, he gives us the best from the very start. As the audience, we are immediately enchanted by a symphony of joy and delightful music. I won't spoil the entire scene, but it is done with such incredible craft and skill, it will be remembered for a long time to come.On that freeway, our protagonists, Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) are introduced. Both are struggling artists, trying to find their way in LA. Mia is an aspiring actress and Sebastian is a talented pianist, determined to revive and preserve traditional jazz music. Through a series of chance meetings, the two eventually fall for each other, and pursue their dreams, with one another by their side. The chemistry between and Stone and Gosling is undeniably instantaneous. The fiery intensity of their connection reminded me of the classic Hollywood couples we admired and loved, like Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall.A city of dreams, there is no better place than LA to tell this story. On the surface, to those of us unfamiliar with the true essence and identity of the city, we can easily be mesmerised by its allure and its potential for achieving our romanticised ideals. Chazelle wanted to re-create the classic and nostalgic look of the city during the 1950s, and he has successfully captured not just the aesthetic, but also the timeless feeling the city exudes, with a tinge of novelty. To Chazelle, the sound of LA is jazz. Justin Hurwitz's score is a blend of pure extravagance and subtlety. With its jazz influences and undertones, each note tells a story of its own. The trumpet gave the film its life and energy, while the piano touched our hearts and soothed our soul.I was particularly awestruck at the daedal use of light and the camera-work in this film. Each shot must have been planned meticulously, and yet, they appear very natural. The dance sequences are flawless, effortlessly blending in with the story itself. The hilltop dance between Stone and Gosling - I can imagine just how much effort was invested to get it perfect. As it is taken in one shot, one mistake meant that they would have to start again.The characters of Mia and Sebastian essentially embody our hopes for romance and our passions. Their journey begins with zealous optimism and as the story progresses, the harsh realities begin to emerge and unveil themselves as they navigate through the challenges. Each one is extremely relatable. In this respect, La La Land is essentially a realistic fairy-tale. In the first half, we are overwhelmed by its elegance and beauty, and in the latter half, we get opportunities to rest our eyes a little, and that is when our hearts start to feel. Beneath the dazzling facade, the story waits for us to discover that warm, but painfully real dynamic that exists between Mia and Sebastian. The music gave this film its rhythm, but it is the love story between these characters that gave La La Land its heartbeat.Each frame of La La Land could be paused, and turned into an exquisite photograph. I am very glad for the success of Whiplash, otherwise this film may not have been made the way it did. It is creative, refreshing, and daringly speaks to our emotions. The songs, the dances, the story and the characters are immensely addictive. The ending of La La left me stunned. It took a while for me to process what has just happened. But this is why this film is so great. The audience is incredibly invested into these characters and when we get results that we didn't expect, we understand it. It would just take a little while for our hearts to mend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
A mood-board with no drama,"This is one of those films that consist of dialogue-scenes that the actors improvise to get into the mood for the real script. Actors love that cheezy 'ranting around' kind of dialogue because they love to swim in scenes, packed with drama and deep, emotional thoughts. They dont care about functionality and contribution to the real story.And what about that 'real story'?
No idea.
I really have no idea what this story is about. Two artists are trying to make it in Hollywood while struggling in a relationship?
OK. That is not a story. Thats a mood-boardWhat did I like then? The production design. Color is very consistent and secluded locations etc add to the alienation as metafor for the inner of the.....pffff...I love Lynch to do that brilliantly in Mullholland Drive (understatement)The actors?
Gosling gives exactly what he 'just' has; a kind of vague notion of ""who am I?"" sort of expression. But Stone, she is the talent, she is under-casted in this one. She may not yet use 10% from her reserves.Music?
A joke.
What idiot ever thought of using a jazz musician as a maincharacter for a musical without jazz music? Anyone?
What a dysfunctional cluster of styles, rithmes, paste's and colours....No, I don't understand the high rankings.
It is just a mood-board without drama.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Beauty in the shape of a Movie,"Every once in a while i get to see a movie that makes me remember why i love movies. I always appreciated people with passion and love for something, they believe is greater than everything transient in our lives. This movie is made by, about and for people who share this feeling. Damien Chazelle loves art, emotions and especially music, which of all art-forms shows the most direct emotional response. And damn he knows how to stage music perfectly.La La Land is now getting big buzz for the award season, but in its heart it's a small film with big topics. Visually stunning and heartbreaking. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are the focus and you love watching them for every second of the movie. Without their chemistry and their individual charisma, it wouldn't work.As a male i have to admit, that no man ever looked more interesting in a suit than Ryan Gosling. Emma Stone as usual seems like the girl you easily fall in love with, but you also can have a laugh and beer with. In one of the first scenes, where she acts as if she had to cry,i really felt it just by watching her. Both actors transport emotions with simple changes in looks or facial expressions through the screen. Something that is highly under-appreciated, due to the fact that loud overacted performances cover them up.Go see this movie, even if musicals are not yours to watch. You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
LA LA Land a HOMERUN !!,"Went to see an early screening of LA LA Land knowing NOTHING about this film. It's grand opening of a traffic jammed Los Angeles freeway on a scorching hot day (we've all been there) that leads to a girl singing in her car, to then an amazing choreographed song and dance number with what felt like 100 singers and dancers all performing on this freeway (no CGI), just blew me away. There were MANY times throughout this film where I went, ""How'd they do that?"" and ""That was amazing!""No story spoilers, but Ryan Gosling's character of Seb (a musician) and Emma Stone's character of Mia (an actress) were perfect in their roles as starving and striving artists trying to make it in their professions. Regardless of the fact these two soul mates are perfect for each other, the real life struggles of juggling their love for one another and their career dreams hits home in a big way.Major kudos to Whiplash director Damien Chazelle.

"Wonderful Hollywood Throwback, But With A Modern Touch","Before the fracturing of cinema into targeted genres, there was a time when the general concept of ""entertainment"" was paramount. All ages went to the theater together, so the imperative to give ""a little something to everyone"" was first and foremost on filmmakers' minds. ""La La Land"" is a throwback to that style of movie production--a rollicking musical that also features a solid plot and interesting characters.For a very basic overview, ""La La Land"" tells the story of two young people trying to make a go of it in Los Angeles: Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a jazz musician with a dream of opening his own club. Mia (Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress who never seems to have any luck in her auditions. After a few chance meetings, however, they discover that it may take their beliefs in each other to make those individual dreams come true.First and foremost, ""La La Land"" is a musical to its very bones. Much (dare I say most) of the emotion and character development is portrayed through song-and-dance numbers, which run the gamut from jazz and big band to orchestral and popular. Justin Hurwitz creates a soundtrack/score that is truly one of the best I have encountered in my cinematic travails. I can all but guarantee you'll be listening/singing/humming the tunes here for days, weeks, or potentially longer after viewing.At the same time, however, ""La La Land"" is not vapid in any sense. Its story of perseverance, the power of relationships, and dream-fulfillment is endemic to the human condition, and director Damien Chazelle is able to expertly weave such themes within the musical numbers. The songs, dances, plots, and characters all intertwine to create a perfect tapestry of emotion.It doesn't hurt that the chemistry between leads Gosling and Stone is absolutely off-the-charts--truly the stuff of legends. Again, a sort of throwback to the Old Hollywood studio systems where leading men & women were often thrust together in multiple pictures. The Gosling-Stone combination was cultivated through previous pairings of their own, and that familiarity comes to a perfect crescendo here.Overall, I consider ""La La Land"" to be a very deserving full-star effort. It may not make any groundbreaking political, racial, or societal statements, but every time I watch I'm instantly pulled into its fun atmosphere and endearing messages. Sometimes, a film--even in today's fractured cinema environment--can simply be ""all about the entertainment factor"", and in that capacity ""La La Land"" is at the top of my list.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Amazing Musical Romantic,"Amazing Movie , Rayan Gosling at his best . This Kind of Cinema Of should come to India , Such a concept would definitely work back here .

The worst movie I have seen in a long time,"I have never seen such a horrible film since 2012. It had terrible acting, terrible music, and an incredibly mind-numbing plot. Emma Stone is without a doubt the most annoying actress I have ever encountered. She is so horrible that I will make sure she is not an actress in any film I watch again. I wouldn't even see her films on a bet. I would go if paid to do so, but only with earplugs and an eye-mask.The plot is a typical boy-meets-girl-over-and-over-again til they become a 'thing'. Which is fine, if it's pulled off well. This wasn't, for the reasons I named above.I can't believe this movie got good reviews at all. I had to walk out after 30-40 minutes. I waited until my very tiny (thankfully!) bag of popcorn and beer were finished (which I downed as quickly as possible so I could get the heck out of there), and then I got out of there like a bat out of h-e-double-toothpicks.You might want to watch it if you don't consider Emma Stone the worst and most annoying actress ever, and/or watch Ryan Gosling desperately try to keep up with her poor acting (he had some trouble, but he managed to be a bad actor as well).Anyway, good riddance to bad rubbish. I'm glad I got outta there and that I didn't go with a person who wanted to stay.Find a film that isn't annoying, and go for it. Well, that's my recommendation anyway.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
A brilliant musical and a brilliant film. Best of 2016 so far,"I had watched La La Land at TIFF 2016, and it was a definite highlight of the festival. Having had seen director Damien Chazelle's previous film Whiplash and being utterly blown away by it, I went into La La Land with very high expectations. I'm happy to say, I was far from disappointed. Tonally, La La Land was very different from Whiplash, (one was an intense and dark psychological thriller whereas this was a brilliant, comedic, and emotional romance) but Chazelle's style can still be seen in this film. With two stellar films under his belt, I'm incredibly exited for Chazelle's next project.Performances from Ryan Gosling and especially Emma Stone were absolutely astounding. Both of the stars were able to authentically portray such a vast range of emotion as well as deliver great musical performances. The chemistry between the two actors was great. Gosling and Stone were able to believably play off of one another and it made for an entertaining and emotionally engaging relationship to watch unfold. John Legend gave a good performance in his supporting role, although he was outshone by the stars of the film.The costume and set design were expertly done and well utilized in the story. Where a lesser film may establish character through expository dialogue, Chazelle tells the audience what there is to know about his characters by showing us details like the color of her dress, the dustiness of his apartment, or even the make of his car. The mise-en-scene is employed to establish the tone of the movie. For example, there are multiple comedic scenes in which the comedy is derived from the clash between the costumes and setting. A more dramatic, tragic scene uses the lighting to communicate to us the emotions which the characters are trying to communicate to each other. The lighting would often be used as a way to transport the film from the real world to a more dream-like, surreal, timeless space. In many scenes, the hue of the lighting is used to represent emotion or even to represent a particular character. The use of spotlights was also helpful to establish tone and mood.The cinematography is stunning. With a wide variety of beautiful shots, La La Land is able to convey emotion. A simple point-of-view shot can turn a stereo speaker into a symbol of longing or a stained ceiling into a symbol of desperation. The production of some of the shots were impressive, especially during the musical numbers. These scenes employed a variety of long shots, crane shots, and dolly shots. Another example of raw talent to be marveled at.The editing was good. Chazelle knew when to cut and when not to cut. Cuts were strategically placed for the sake of comedy, similarly, other shots would linger for a decent length to emphasize the drama and tension of the scene.This entire review can be spent discussing the film's soundtrack. Not only did this film display what is perhaps this decade's greatest soundtrack yet, but the score was so essential to the movie. Whenever placed in the film, the lyrics and tone of the music perfectly compliment the tone and plot. Every single piece of music in this film is so expertly written and fits so superbly within the film. There are plenty of clever double and triple entendres in songs like City of Stars which comment on the plot and the larger themes of the film all at once. The musical performances by Gosling, Stone and John Legend were all out of this world. The soundtrack is the highlight of this film and it will, without a doubt, win La La Land at least one Oscar come February.The story was simplistic yet admirably written. Unlike many romantic films that will force in some contrived conflict between the two leads in order to push the film into the third act, every plot point in La La Land feels natural and believable. There are a couple of encounters and events towards the beginning of the film that feel a little too coincidental. But as long as you can suspend your disbelief a little, they won't be anything that will ruin the movie. If I had to choose I would say that the plot is the weakest element of this film, if not only because every other aspect was done so perfectly.La La Land was an amazing, alluring, magnificent, emotional roller-coaster of a film. I am excited to see it again when it opens next week, and to see it win at the Oscars. The opening scene alone is worthy of multiple Oscars so it wouldn't be surprising if this took home best picture. This film is an anthem for all the fools who dream. 9/10. Best film of 2016 so far.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
A beautiful love letter to every foolish lovers and dreamers in the universe.,"okay let's start from the beginning of the movie.from the beginning it's already obvious what kind of movie that we're going to get.a bunch of people dancing in the middle of traffic with colorful outfits. they're singing a song from the soundtrack called ""Another Day of Sun"" which I would like you guys to check it out. this opening really sets the tone of the movie, a very colorful and hopeful movie.i was shocked by how bright this movie is. because i'm so used to movies that's dark and gritty.the opening sequence of this movie was filmed in a way so it seems like it was filmed in one take. which in my opinion is just amazing. i don't know how they did it, but it works, and it looks awesome. the song, combined with a great choreography, and swift camera movement. this combination is what makes La La Land so good.not just that, the performances are also really good. Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, all did a terrific job in this movie. particularly Emma Stone. the entire movie works because of her. I think she did most of the jobs. She sings, dancing, acting, and does a lot of stuff that's just amazing. I mean Ryan Gosling did bits too. but, you'll know why I think Emma Stone is the one who gave the best performance in this movie once you saw the movie yourself.La La Land also use colors in a very interesting way. as I said before, this movie is very colorful. although not as strong as Nicolas Winding Refn's usage of colors. this movie also use color to elevate the emotion of a scene. the most prominent color in this movie is Purple. i don't know why, but it works so well. you'll see purple everywhere.also, the lighting works. oh my god.. it reminds me to a lot of movies from back in the day. fair to say this movie has one of the best visual works of the year.as someone who have ""Jazz"" as his own name. I can't appreciate this movie more. if you're a big fan of music Jazz. you'll have a blast, Jazz is basically one of the strongest aspect of this movie. throughout the entirety of the movie. I always think of my dad. he'll love this movie so much. Ryan Gosling's character is in someway, represent my dad. he is so passionate about Jazz, and he's sad cause no one can relate to him. which brings us to the next point, and the most important aspect of the movie.what is this movie about? lots of people are saying that this movie is a love letter to LA or even an homage to the golden age of Hollywood. while it's not wrong either, LA looks amazing in this movie, the way it's shot, it looks great. and it's obvious as well that Damian Chazelle is trying to pay homage to the Golden Era. by how this movie begins and ended.but at its core, this movie is about passionate people. about the one who dreams. about how it doesn't matter how foolish you seem you should go out there and go for your dream. go for anything you want in life. and it's also about the sacrifices that we have to make along the way. that even though we might get what we want in life, we still not going to get everything. there's a price to everything.and all of that, told in a very beautiful, touching, and heartbreaking way. much like life itself.which is why i'm also going to talk about the ending. don't worry it's not a spoiler. i was worried with how this movie is going to end. cause i don't really want a clichéd ending just to keep the ""good-feeling"" but no guys, the ending is amazing, it's not cliché at all. it's amazing, you'll loved it.the ending was pretty much the same like the opening. but more beautiful, and unique. by same I mean, done with dancing and music.and as a dreamer, who's at times is an absolute fool. i am in love with this movie, and you'll probably think i'm biased but if i say the otherwise, then i'll be lying. I love this movie, and this movie is definitely going to be a movie that i'll watch again and again until i'm dying.Great, great film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
A Musical That Is Pure & Magical,"Charming! Magnificent! Great!This was a pure & magical cinematic experience. I love musical movies and I was waiting for this movie since I heard about it. Wow! It exceeded my expectations!Ryan Gosling & Emma Stone were perfect! Now we can easily say that Damien Chazelle became one of the important directors working today. Everything was stunning in this movie. The songs and the music were amazing. The dance sequences were done brilliantly. The cinematography, the editing and the production design were excellent. A lot of people said that La La Land looks like a dream. Yes, it is a dream! A dream that has a lot of charming moments but also has sad moments!If you have big dreams or passion about something, you will find this movie inspiring to let you follow your dreams and passions.La La Land is one of the biggest surprises in 2016. I was really happy with every second in it. I enjoyed it on so many levels And again, since I am a big fan of musical movies, it gave me full satisfaction!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Not what I expected,"Not a fan of jazz so take note that if you love jazz, this is for you. Had no clue Emma Stine could sing. Storyline was sad and made me want to cry but just goes to show that life is fill of ups and downs. It is very slow in the beginning - I wanted to stop watching it numerous times but kept plowing through. I can see why it won awards just not all that. A little long and again, the music.? Ick. The male lead is a wonderful actor and doesn't get enough credit. Seems he's looked over in everything he's in except Barbie.

Here's to the one who dream,"Unhappy is a person who never dared to dream. This world and our mind have the endless opportunities and we have to be really miserable to even try to suppress those opportunities, because without our perfectional ideas and notions of life and how we should live it, we become empty bodies and let physiology do its thing. Only when you dare to dream you let yourself flow in a world of pure imagination and possibilities, you create your individuality and slightly optimistic and romantic perception of life which helps you get through the tough times and standard routines of daily life. Having the hope that someday you can achieve whatever you have pictured in your head gives you wings and positives to go on. And this one's for dreamers out there who dared to dream and achieved something in their life, for those who are on their way to do so and for those who are too scared to try. Yes, it may go in a completely different direction, but you will never know until you try. Sometimes life has better things to offer than we can imagine and it may lead to something wonderful and new. Lumiere brothers had only visions in their heads and ambitions when they invented film as we know it now, being inspired by Thomas Edison and others. Would they have done it if they never chased the dream? You know the answer. The answer is A Trip to the Moon, City Lights, Casablanca, Space Odyssey, The Godfather, Schindler's List, Lord of the Rings and La La Land. The latter one is a perfect addition to the history of cinema, absolutely deserving of all the praise it receives. Would I change anything in it? Not a single word or move. From the astonishing play of colors and tones to the hopeful and sparkling eyes of the characters were captured wonderfully by one of the bravest and inspiring dreamers of modern Hollywood - Damien Chazelle. Dreaming is simple, he made it clear to himself and to the audience with this movie. No tricky turns and twists in the story line, no complicated dialogues. Everything is clear to the point that it lets you just enjoy the whole spectacle with a bit of nostalgia of your own forgotten dreams, of where you are right now in your life and where are you heading to. All of this is spiced up with magical hidden character called music. From City of Stars to the last note of Mia & Sebastian's Theme, the soundtrack is wonderful. It is cheerful, it is sad, it is hopeful and simply mesmerizing. Undoubtedly the best film in recent years deserving of all the golden statues including the main one for best picture, proving that the best movie of the year can be about a simple subject and not about a slumdog boy who becomes millionaire or a king struggling with his speech, or American heroes saving lives in Iran or elsewhere. This movie is relatable to everyone. Although dreamers or la la landers are considered to be out of this world and not aware of what is happening, we are all still foolishly, with a bit of hope and enthusiasm, trying to chase our dreams and create our own world of reality. So here's to the one who dream.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"Sublime, Beautiful, and Award Worthy","There are several scenes in 'La La Land' that have no dialogue; only a dreamy background score and the actors' expressions guide you through. The beautiful thing here is that you don't miss the spoken word at all. This and many other things make La La Land a subliminal watch. It is a gorgeous movie full of heart and soul and I loved every minute of it.The film is a musical journey about an aspiring actress and an undervalued jazz musician who meet at a low point in their lives and keep running into each other until sparks fly. The story traces their life as they find themselves and pursue their dreams whilst falling in love. The musical genre isn't my favorite (odd I know since I adore Indian movies) but this isn't just about the song and dance routine though that's an integral part of the film. The movie starts with rush hour in LA and people from all walks of life sing their way through the chaos. This first number sets a tone that's rare for movies nowadays, joy. However, the movie isn't all happy, the characters grow, face rejection, fight, but interestingly the mood is never bleak. Its charm is infectious and leaves you wanting to tap your feet.Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling and perfectly cast as Mia and Sebastian. Ms. Stone delights as a struggling actress whose eyes speak volumes and who can make the most trivial of activities seem noteworthy. At the risk of sounding too cheesy she is the heart while Mr. Gosling is the soul of this gorgeous masterpiece. He is charming without arrogance. He is funny, slightly broken, and good- a lethal combination. Both complement each other marvelously and the chemistry they've built over the years can almost be touched.There are ample songs in the narrative, of course, and they are enough to whet the palate without leaving you feeling burdened. The singing isn't perfect but we can't expect our actors to do everything flawlessly. The choreography and the ease with which the characters dance is applaudable. As the seasons change you notice brilliantly executed shifts in our leads without ever losing the essence of the movie. There's a fine screenplay at work here. Bravo Damien Chazelle, your vision is glorious. Watch this film, you'll find ample reasons to love it. I left the theatre feeling a little giddy with a smile on face.

I did not expect that,"I watched the movie because it was Ryan and Emma, and I really liked the first half. But I think that in the second half of the film he gets away from reality. And people don't watch romantic movies because they have an unhappy ending. People want to fill the void that has formed in their hearts at least a little with such films. He wants to correct the chances he lost, the wrong decisions he made, by putting himself in the place of the lead role in the film. But I don't see him in this movie. There are also a lot of musical and folkloric elements. The negative aspects of the film. I must also say that if the movie had ended with a happy ending, I would have given it 7 points. I wonder if the people who made the film think that women are the betraying side in a relationship, don't I get it? Anyway, it's weird not knowing that!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Where did the Golden Age of Hollywood go?,"""La La Land"" is an American romantic musical comedy-drama film written and directed by Damien Chazelle in 2016. After its' success at the 74th Golden Globe Awards, I couldn't give a go by the musical that set a record and won seven awards, including Best Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Screenplay, Best Original Score, and best Original Song. What can I say after finally watching this film? Well, best wishes to the New Hollywood Era. Your Golden Age has gone.The idea of recreating and breathing a new life in outstanding musicals of Golden Age if Hollywood turned out a complete fiasco. ""La La Land"" is full of weird clichés, awful mise en scène, poorly rehearsed dancing actions, and doubtful twists in the plot. Furthermore, the production department failed to make outstanding shots as well as edit them in a right way with a good taste. I won't even start to complain about bad color correction and sound. Seriously? For the budget in thirty million dollars they couldn't produce clear recording that is supposed to be a number one factor in musical? Bad for them.The first scene on the highway gave me full understanding that this musical is just a frustration. The dancers probably failed to join one of the Step Up movies and were redirected to ""La La Land"" as a joke. Choreography is terrible when the viewer can't see it as a whole action, or focus on main characters. Choreography in ""La La Land"" is more than terrible. I was laughing. Not in a good way. And again it is one of the main parts of such genre as musical.The plot itself is boring and slow. There is no progression and no drive that brings the will to continue watching it. Half of actions and scenes were added and shown with no particular reasons to show them. Actually, there is no evident chemistry between the two protagonists. What is kind of shameful, especially because of the fact that it is not the first project, where Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone play together. Come on guys, show some love for each other. Some drama at least. Their relationship on stage was more comedic than tremulous.Acting. One of the strangest things for me is to watch the Golden Globe's Best Actress in a movie where she can barely act. On the one hand, she was supposed to be a failed actress, who went her journey and reached her goals. But on the other hand, Emma Stone haven't done a good job in the general scenes also. Regarding Ryan Gosling, his passion for Jazz was overacted, as he has no passion at all. Besides, as a musician myself, It was a pain watching his performances. It was so obvious that he just can't play piano. I almost closed my eyes, so I can only lose myself in music. As well as in their dancing scenes. It looked too lame.To sup up, ""La La Land"" is a pure frustration mixed with some dramatic comedy. I can't call it a musical with a capital ""M."" Actually, I can't call it a musical at all. No good music, no good sound, no good dancing.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Great musical that breathes life into the genre once again.,"Honestly when I was first told about the premise of La La Land, I was pretty uninterested. I love musicals and films of any genre, but this one didn't peak my interest. It was only after it was nominated for 14 Oscars (which is the same amount as my favorite film of all time, Titanic) that I really noticed it.And boy was I glad I did! This movie is refreshing. It puts to rest all the things about complex plots, ""inappropriate"" material and language that so many movies have today, and lets us take a two-hour trip into the fantasy world of the story and its characters.The songs were enjoyable, with ""Someone In the Crowd"" being the standout. The duets were emotional, and I felt the connection, the bright colors and eccentric dances added to the nostalgic feel of the story. It did an exceptional job blending timeless musicals with modern traditions.I thought Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling did a great job at their parts, with Stone being the standout. Their characters felt real, like someone you could really meet walking down the street. Their chemistry was good, and I loved that this movie highlights the ups and downs of relationships, because not every relationship is as flawless as the fairy tales say.I see some negative reviews about the singing and dancing being out of tune and not perfect, but I think it adds to the story. When the characters make a tiny wrong step, or their voices shake, it adds an extra element of realism that I don't think everyone sees. I for one like the tiny mistakes that you can point out. No one is truly flawless.I think the only thing I didn't like was the pacing. It was a bit slow, but it's understandable considering you wouldn't add a car chase or some action sequence to a romance musical. I also think it could've used one more group song like the first two in the film.But overall, it's a clean movie that will give you a roller coaster of emotions, and leave you with melodies and tunes playing in your head all night. A must see for anyone who loves musicals.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Nonetheless, I came into the theatre expecting an above average rom-com. I was completely satisfied in many regards. I don't even like musicals, but this movie changed my mind. The choreography was not strained, the songs both told an important story and more important sounded good and the chemistry in Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's characters was absolutely terrific. It makes it hard to digest that these two are not together in real life as I might even dare to say that the chemistry between these two exceeds even the chemistry found between Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams in The Notebook.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Beautiful music and enchanting movie.,"Beautiful music and enchanting movie.. When I first saw the trailer for La La Land my expectations were set high. The excellent cast, the music and an exciting new director/writer were enough to get me in the door. I'm always a bit hesitant when it comes to filmed musicals.. Will it be stagy, stilted and awkward? Not in this case. Damien Chazelle has made a wonderfully cinematic and loving ode to the dreamers and artists of the world. Having lived in LA and worked on both sides of the camera I can relate to much of this film's endearing observations, trials and tribulations; but anyone who's ever yearned for what seems impossible and searched for true love will also easily connect with this film's gargantuan heart. I'm a self proclaimed total movie snob not easily pleased by much of what I see, but La La Land gave me all the feels and more. I cannot recommend this film enough. It's the kind of film you leave and you don't want the buzz, the tickle, the movie-high to end. I can't wait to see it again when it's in wide release.

The only movie that brought me into it in 2016,"La La Land is just on show in China today. I heard that it is a movie about romantic love and music, so I decided to go for it with my girlfriend. Beyond my imagination, it comes to an sad ending, so sad that made me cry.In LA, the city full of dream, is not just like everyone dreamed. Many people lose themselves, forgive their original intention.I have seen lots of movies in 2016, it is a truth that Hollywood is getting worse. La La Land is the only film that bring me in. I could get the feeling of Mia, when she cries, I cry. When she smiles, I smile. Music and Dance are really great things in the world.The movie also reminds me that I should do what I really like. If you love music, then just do it. If you like movies, then just go for it. Don't think too much about the final result. Even you are a ""successful man"", with an unhappy job, it won't make you feel any sense of achievement. Following myself would be the most charming part of me.I also read love from the movie. The two persons just like having special chemical reaction with each other. They are getting better and better while staying with each other. This is exactly the kind of love that I want to have. And...I wish the love I have is the very kind of love. I don't love her rich or success, but her full passion and enthusiasm about life.There are many versions of our life, any single tiny decision could lead to a total different one, and this is called Butterfly Effect.

"Yes, they can still make them like they used to!","My wife and I heard good things about this film and went to see it this evening. We loved it. Emma Stone sings, dances and acts her part to perfection. Ryan Gosling is brilliant; and actually plays the piano in this film damn well, especially if you consider he reportedly didn't play at all and practiced 2 hours a day, 6 days a week to provide such a convincing performance. The wonderful music and score, the extensive use of primary colours, the great romantic story; all of them prove that they can make them like they used to. La La Land doesn't get too soppy but it does get under your skin in a nice feel good kind of way. We cannot recommend it high enough and hope it cleans up at the Oscars, especially for the lead performances, writing and best film.

Let your self wander into the world of LA LA LAND. A Must Watch. A Masterpiece.,"Remember the name. Damien Chazelle. Writer and Director, aged 32, without a doubt he is upstaging those in the industry for decades. If he builds on this momentum his reach will certainly be endless. He is 2 for 2 with WHIPLASH and LA LA LAND. Its way too soon to stack him up there with the Allens' and Scoreceses'. But without a doubt Chazelle is ""now"" noteworthy.This original screenplay and direction is as inspirational as its beautiful. Its mellow yet potent, its tranquil and flamboyant, it's a motion picture but theatrical in its essence. The simplest of stories unfolded in the most enchanting of ways. The theatrical approach, the balance between the new and revolutionary whilst preserving a semblance of tradition. The last I recall being this engrossed in a movie of this genre is with MOULIN ROUGE.Nominated for 14 Academy Awards tying the record of TITANIC and ALL ABOUT EVE, LA LA LAND is story of love. A Jazz pianist (Ryan Gosling) and an actress (Emma Stone) find their lives intertwined in a struggle of finding themselves and love. Gosling isn't new at toying with emotions, he does so with a strange aura of simplicity surrounding his performance. Its ethereal. Stone is almost as good as she was in her role in BIRDMAN. Both characters are built blandly from ground which makes it a challenge for the actors. Its magical what Gosling and Stone do with it.Appreciating LA LA LAND is a test. Losing interest isn't arduous. Musicals are not for everyone. Considering the initial half hour of the movie and its slow start, this title necessitates patience. Further it's a work of art holistically. The mesmerizing soundtrack, the vibrant set, the acute direction and the impeccable acting eventually makes it all worth you while.VerdictLet your self wander into the world of LA LA LAND.

"I wasn't as bowled over as most people purport to be, but it was much better than anticipated.","I'll be the first to admit that I'm not in the target demographic for 'La La Land (2017)', especially considering that I hold the musical as my least favourite and most cringe-inducing genre by quite a wide margin, but I've always maintained that I will watch almost anything within reason and it's been hard to find anyone - from critics and the academy to general audiences and even those who, much like me, are not typically enamoured by the genre - not singing this nostalgically musical romantic-comedy's praises at the top of their lungs. So, I gritted my teeth as I gave it a watch and I'm glad that, while I can safely say that I wasn't anywhere near as bowled over as most people purport to be, it's actually much better than I was expecting thanks mainly to some superb directing and a mature, layered screenplay. It's clearly at its best when not overtly a musical, the conceivably diegetic song-and-dance routines fit the material much better than the ones clearly abstracted from the predetermined reality (made all the more jarring when overly fantastical elements, such as flying, are tossed into the fray), as it tells a subversive story that slowly creeps away from its romanticised roots and ends on an aptly realistic note with a message that runs counter to most others in the genre. Plus, a couple of the songs are kind of catchy, too. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
As perfect as a film can be,"I don't like to say it often, but I think it's pretty much impossible for anyone with a heart and soul to dislike La La Land. It's an exceptionally joyful and uplifting film, full of vibrant and delightful settings, dance numbers and cinematography. It's also a story for the ages, with an incredibly relatable and often bittersweet look at the difficult path to achieving your dreams. Its lead performances are amazing, Damien Chazelle gives arguably one of the best directing performances of all time, and most of all, its music is wonderful.There's so much to talk about with La La Land, and all of it is good. However, I think it's best to start with the man who both directed and wrote this absolute masterpiece: Damien Chazelle. His previous outing with Whiplash was something incredibly special, and already seen as a modern classic, but he goes to new lengths to indulge his love for cinema and music with La La Land.And this isn't the sort of self-indulging passion project like some recent Tarantino and Scorsese films that seem to be made to entertain the directors themselves more than anyone else, because Chazelle is all too pleased to take us along on a magical journey through the wondrous place where dreams are made and broken, harking back to the Golden Age of Hollywood better than any film before.With his dynamic visual style, the film has wonderful energy and ambition, strengthening the story of our main characters striving to achieve their dreams. However, the way in which he uses so many motifs from Classic Hollywood, including the bright, vibrant colours of the costumes, long and elegant instrumental sequences, and even the odd touch of a film-noir vibe from time to time, is such a joy for any film fan to see. With so many little details about Hollywood past and present sprinkled here and there, I could watch this film a million times and still be utterly enchanted by its love for the movies.But what's even more impressive is that the film's screenplay is also written by Damien Chazelle. The film's story may sound like cheesy and fanciful rubbish at first, but the success of the film's story is testament to how good Chazelle's writing is. Uplifting, joyful and wonderfully magical at almost every moment, the central romance is spellbinding to follow, whilst the conviction that our two main characters have to achieve their dreams, even if they get knocked down from time to time, is so admirable to see. The result of that is that we have a story in which it's so easy to care about the protagonists' hopes and ambitions, and an absolute pleasure to spend two hours with them as they navigate a turning point in their lives.The thing is, Chazelle goes one better than an uplifting and magical musical by also providing some emotionally riveting themes. Particularly as the film moves towards a spectacular and what I'm sure will be legendary finale, Chazelle inserts some beautifully tender and bittersweet emotions to the story, as well as providing an exceptionally unpredictable and innovative way to tell a story of star-crossed lovers.Next up are the central performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. We've seen the two work brilliantly on screen together in Crazy Stupid Love, but there's something even more magical about their partnership in La La Land.Apart from the fact that they make a wonderfully convincing and captivating romantic couple on screen, there's never a moment where one overshadows the other. The two work together to make their characters so lovable and fascinating, and that means that, whilst there's always so much to be impressed by in their incredibly dynamic individual performances, there's nothing more special than seeing them together on screen.Whether that's in some of the film's more blissful romantic periods, or whether they're sparring, they both play off one another with ease, and make for the most entertaining and energetic leading lady and gentleman I've ever seen.And whilst Stone and Gosling aren't quite Debbie Reynolds and Gene Kelly when it comes to the vocals, their singing is just as good as their acting. However, as a lot of the music in La La Land is a little more restrained than classic 40s and 50s musicals, it requires a less showy singing voice.And that leads me nicely into the one thing that might make you reluctant to see La La Land: the music. I love a good movie musical, and my favourites are all from the 1940s-60s era, just what this film is a love letter to. Put simply, however, La La Land is easily my favourite musical of all time, and undoubtedly one of the best ever made.When so many movie musicals fail to weave storytelling and musical numbers together, La La Land does it so effortlessly. The moments where the characters break into song feel completely natural, and the songs themselves aren't just entertaining toe-tappers, but integral parts of the story, that accomplish storytelling better than any musical I've ever seen. As such, I was always overjoyed when the characters broke into song, something that I've never really felt before in a musical.So, overall, I was completely spellbound by La La Land. Doing something that no movie musical has ever done to me before, making me excited to see a story told through song, as well as providing an uplifting, funny and wonderfully joyful story, the film is a real delight. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling's performances are pitch- perfect, whilst Damien Chazelle's innovative and passionate writing and directing are the icing on the cake for this absolute triumph of a film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"An Epic and beautiful musical, pity they can't sing.","7/10. An Actress and a Jazz pianist fall in love, in this musical love story. Directed by Damien Chazelle who also did Whiplash in 2014, a movie I really loved. This time he pairs up Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, and they're beautiful together, they show what two class actors can do when put together. I enjoyed their chemistry, and the heart they put into this. The music and the score are fantastic, and put you in the film with them. One draw back I found, however, is that either of them can sing well, and they both have quite weak and quiet voices. I would have enjoyed some stronger lead voices. Also, not to give anything away, but I liked the whole ride, I just didn't like the way the director decided to go with the ending, it left me a bit angry. All those troubles aside, if you are a fan of musicals, Ryan Gosling and or Emma Stone, then you must see this one. If not then I think you will actually hate it.

Beautiful and unpredictable masterpiece,"Boy, I am glad, I got to watch this at the cinema, because it is definitely worth watching there.I want to describe La La Land as a visually beautiful, non-cliché, romantic movie that not only has a stunning love story, but also goes much deeper into topics like 'Dreams' and 'Music', while the movie stays rooted in reality, which gives a lot of credit to the title ""La La Land."" I found it quite easy to understand why, and that is exactly what I personally like about a movie of this scale. It is capable of telling a story about difficult characters in difficult situations and explaining this in a simple way to the ordinary viewer. This is why, I think, it stowed away so many Oscars at the Academy Awards and also, why it received so many nominations. I will just mention a few of the obvious ones here, just to awaken your movie hunger a little, if you haven't watched it yet:Emma Stone did really deserve that Oscar for a portrayal of the lost actress in L.A. of epic proportions. Ryan Gosling was nice to see as well in a more sophisticated role, where he must have worked a lot harder with the character in this movie than some of his other typical bad boy roles. In addition, I also do feel the need to greatly applaud the entire music soundtrack in this film, as it underlines the beautiful imagery and scenery of the movie. Behind the camera it is obvious that magic was worked here too. I mean, talk about experimental camera angles and zooming... I haven't seen anything like it, since 'Birdman'. So in conclusion, what Damien Chazelle created here as the director and won the Oscar for Best achievement in Directing, is truly a remarkably beautiful, timeless picture that will most likely be worth re-watching again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

say hello to musical movies,"La La Land is a musical and it is a fact that the current movie audience is different from the audience in the 50s who loved musicals. Even the great movies like dancing in the rain and an American in Paris where Gene Kelly dances are not being watched by the new generation who has grown up listening to this rock and other modern music. Some peoples initially say that 'the period of musical films has passed, this film does not do business. (but apparently the viewer liked this film.) However, La la land is opening with a stage where the people who stuck in the traffic, starts to dance with joyful drums playing jazz rhythm which also catches the audience. It is said that after people watch the movie they return home with a happier, better and higher mood. But in the La La Land, on the background is not only classic jazz, but a rhythm-dominated popular music and jazz-blended musical genre surrounds a broader audience. Unlike past musicals, dance and music alone are not enough. It is a solid production in the dramatic direction, for example, the characters' dialogues are very strong. It can respond to the expectations of the younger but more intellectual audience of today. Director Damien Chazell stated that his favorite films were 'The umbrellas of Cherburg' (1964, directed by Jaques Demy, actress Catherine Deneuve).Chazell is a very young director and writer. We remember him from the film 'Whiplash', which he wrote and directed again in 2013. Cinematographers remember that movie with a drummer who struggles in the hands of a tyrannical music instructor. The director seems to have a mission to make people love jazz music, and this new film continues to progress from that track.The main players are Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Ryan Gosling's biography is pretty full. Emma Stone entered the cinema with her 2010 film 'Easy A'. Though the filmography is not yet rich, it seems likely to win the Oscar with the perfect game in La la land. So we are almost witnessing the birth of a real star as if it were in the same movie role as this production. J. K. Simmons, who plays the role of bullying trainer in Whiplash, is surprised by a small role (boss who does not understand the music).It's about the impossible love of Sebastian who wants to play refined jazz but forced to play music that he dislikes in ordinary places and Mia an ambitious cafe cashier who wants to be a player. The American dream is brutal. Whether you want to pursue a career, or climb to the fame, even the bonds of love are as weak as cotton yarn. I recommend that the audience pay particular attention to the final scene. It's as if referring to the final scene of the unforgettable Casablanca movie.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Eh.,"Since the overwhelming consensus is that this is the best thing since sliced bread, my opinion probably means very little here. Still, I'll try to sum up my feeling of the film:5 seconds in, I had tears in my eyes.The first musical number is absolutely incredible. It's big, it's wild, it's colourful and filled with power and joy.The last scene in the movie is absolutely amazing as well; I won't spoil anything, but it somehow captures both the extreme highs and the lows of emotion in only a few minutes.It's the bits in the middle that bother me.See, a lot of it just... drawn out. At some point, it just becomes an infinite loop of the two lead actors staring wistfully into the distance to jazz music. There are a few of those big show-stopper numbers in between, but they jar with the long, quiet blandness of the rest of the film. These two parts of the film are never reconciled. There's something off about the flow of the whole thing, the way it all connects. The cinematography and colours are beautiful even in the ""normal"" scenes, but all of the big emotional creativity - the actual core of the movie - seems to have been reserved for the songs.Now, this wouldn't be a problem if there was a song for each important beat, but there are only about 5 songs that are actually sung by the characters. Considering most Broadway musicals have about 15 songs, this movie exists in a weird state where the creators aren't sure as to whether they want a colourful larger-than-life Broadway musical or a realistic, toned-down non-musical drama. Which is a shame, really, because the scenes on their own are crafted masterfully; it's just that they fall apart as a whole.The cinematography and directing is a delight; the actors are lovely, if limited by the script (as said, they spend a lot of time staring wistfully into the distance), and the music is wonderful. So, I dunno, go watch it if you have the time - you'll probably like it more than I did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"Watchable, if you can sit through the first half","This is only the third Hollywood musical I have seen after High School Musical and Les Miserables. While the former was crap, the latter was a masterpiece but the commonality between the two movies was that they were coherent within themselves. That's what was missing in La La Land, for the first half at least. It's a good movie overall, with beyond brilliant second half, but only if you are able to survive the first half.Story (7/10): Two people keep bumping into each other on various occasions and eventually fall for each other only to realize that their professional success will come at the cost of their love life. Incidentally, none of them are dishonest but the circumstances bring them at a juncture where they have to pick one. The story is written on a very strong plot but as it gets into the details, it starts falling apart. LA was a near-perfect location to base this story with Ryan Gosling portraying a struggling musician (a Jazz enthusiast), and Emma Stone projecting an aspiring actress with a day job at a coffee shop. The build up of their love affair is totally unconvincing. As far as the first half goes, the scenes do not have much connect between them and the music pieces are abrupt. Just because you have a musical, doesn't mean you need to have a song every 2 minutes. This movie would have been much better without the musical piece. However, it is the second half where the movie gets far better. The scenes are well thought and the music pieces - especially ""City of Stars"" and ""The Fools Who Dream"" - are very profound and apt to the situation.Acting (8/10): Ryan Gosling might have squeezed every little drop of his charm into this movie but he came across as a far stronger actor than his counterpart Emma Stone. While the roles weren't so challenging, the two have been good enough individually. However, for me, the chemistry was somewhat missing between the two actors. I could totally see Jennifer Lawrence in Mia's role, instead. Apart from these two, none of the other actors have received much screen time to create any impact.Music (8/10): The film rides on quite a strong music and lyrics. It looks a little unnecessary and too much in the first half, except for ""Another Day of Sun"" which was quite perfect to set the tone of the movie as well as get the audience into an LA mood. However, some of the songs like ""City of Stars"", ""Epilogue"" and ""The Fools Who Dream"" are so good that you can listen to them on repeat mode.Direction (7/10): Damien Chazelle probably took a little too much into his plate with story writing, direction as well as lyrics. While I love the way he steered the movie in the second half, it is the first half where the movie is all over the place and very confusing. The build up of the story is pretty vague. The scenes are very much incoherent and an unconvincing. However, the later part of the movie is good. I loved the choice of climax, especially the last scene with a rewind sequence, which was very unconventional. Full marks to the director for that.Overall (7/10): Overall, it's a watchable movie, if you can sit through the first half.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
La La Land,"""Mia"" (Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress who juggles a coffee shop job with countless, fruitless, auditions. ""Sebastian"" is a budding jazz musician who falls a bit foul of his boss (JK Simmons) when he decides to spice up some of the more mundane Christmas ditties he has to trot out on his restaurant piano and gets fired. The two meet and after a slightly rocky soon start to appreciate that they actually have more in common than they might have expected - and so off they set down their especially bumpy yellow brick road. This feature is a colourful and vibrant tribute to all things Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly with an hint of romance and one or two catchy tunes to help keep the pace bouncing along for a couple of hours. It wallows, unashamedly, in the nostalgia of the good old days and then - thanks to the likes of John Legend's ""Keith"" - attempts to turn it's focus to the future. Not just of this couple, but of their chosen forms of art. It's no cakewalk for the pair and that's an integral part of this enjoyable tale of their relationship and the pressures put upon it by their aspirations. Those magnetisms that fuel their affection at the start soon start to have the opposite effect as success applies unevenly between them and an happy ending is by no means a certainty. There's plenty of light-heartedness throughout and it's affection for the heyday of Hollywood is writ engagingly large as it trips along. No stunt doubles, dubbed singing, piano playing nor dancing also adds quite a bit to the charm of the pair's antics and ""Another Day of Sun"" and ""City of Stars"" show Pasek/Paul and Justin Hurwitz have their fingers on the pulse. Cheesy? Well a little, but this is still big screen entertainment cinema that I really did enjoy. Not quite sure what Ryan Gosling has to do to get an Oscar, though!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"Hollywood is Great, Isn't It?","If I could sum up this film briefly, it would be that it is a modern recreation of what would be considered a ""classic"" Hollywood film stylistically. All of the things that seem like cliches in this film are callbacks to the way those older films were made and it's mixed with modern techniques, including long, uninterrupted shots, which help give this film an impressive visual flair that isn't paralleled very often. La La Land even has the saturated look that technicolor films had back in the day. It's a seamless blend of old and new and every technical aspect of La La Land is brilliantly executed. The only downside to all of this is that the callbacks to old Hollywood and the nostalgic charm that it has can become a little annoying and distract from what's happening. Of course, it should be noted that this is a musical and I don't really have a taste for musicals so, take that criticism with a grain of salt.This is one of those rare occasions where both the leads match each other's charm and play off each other extremely well. Ryan Gosling, in particular, is really good at portraying charming, down-to-earth characters and that shines though magnificently here.I still have trouble over the obsession with old jazz music though. Sebastian's obsession with jazz is nothing I've ever seen in a musician before- where the only music that matters is a particular era of jazz music and jazz musicians and it comes off as incredibly silly and a little lazy as far as writing goes. Also, I don't believe there is much of a jazz scene in Los Angeles as there would be in New Orleans or New York, so the obsession with jazz and it's non-believability is compounded by the fact that he's in the wrong part of the country for that. It's probably a small thing but it's the defining character trait for Sebastian for a good chunk of the film's run time and it hasn't stopped feeling out of place.La La Land is a really good film and deserves its high praise. For me, the thing that bothers me about it the most is its self-congratulatory attitude towards Los Angeles and Hollywood that comes off as being Oscar Bait- and indeed it ended up being just that. For me, that's what hurts the film the most. That said, it's really good and extremely well executed. It's a double-edged sword but it's worth watching and re-watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"COLOR, COLOR, COLOR","As someone who majored in Theater in college it's probably a no-brainer that I love musicals. As great as on-stage musicals are there is just something about a musical being put on camera that makes it extra exciting.It took me a while to see La La Land but with all of the talk and hype it was getting I know that I had to. The movie was great, the story line was sweet, the chemistry between Gosling and Stone was so real as it always is, and don't even get me STARTED on the colors. If there was one thing that ket me engaged this entire movie it was how colorful it was. The set, wardrobe, lighting, EVERYTHING was so bright and bold I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen.As much as I did enjoy this movie, my rating wasn't as high is other's because at some points I found myself getting a little bored. Even with the two amazing actors and the bright colors that I loved so much my interest in the movie went in and out as I was watching it. I wish I knew what it was exactly that took me out of the film. Maybe the sweet story line wasn't exciting enough for me? Maybe watching it at home led to too many distractions? Maybe I should have seen it before all of the eye so my expectations weren't so high? I'm not sure. But, even with the moments of disinterest La La Land is still a great musical-film and i'd still recommend my fellow musical lovers to see it, if not for the movie in it's entirety, then for Gosling, Stone, and all of the beautiful colors.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Good musical,"Good musical even for the non-professional singer musical' trope is ultimately a matter of personal preference (Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You takes this poetic accessibility to the next level) but it's effective here, thematically underscoring the dissonance of these two 'good but not amazing' dreamers slotting themselves into the iconicity of legend. It's a shame that they're further marred by consistently murky, almost distressingly amateurish sound editing, garbling the audibility of most of the song's lyrics almost past the point of comprehension. 'Naturalism' is one thing, but it's still hard to fall in love with songs we can barely hear.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
College amateur production about being a jerk,"The moral of the ""La La Land"" story is ""you can't have your cake and itif you are a jerk."" No wonder this film was so popular in Hollywood where so many jerks abound who can feel reassured that their messed up lives are fate, not because of their own idiocy. Yes, you can have the love of your life and pursue the passion of your lifeif you're not a jerk about it. And have contrived, ego-laden dinner conversations that you storm away from with the emotion maturity of a 12 year old. The very first sequence sets the two protagonists up as couple of self- absorbed jerks. And the final sequence pivots on what could have been if Sebastian hadn't been a jerk from the outset.But other than that, the film had all the hesitant dance steps, plot transparency, wooden acting (except Emma Stone), off-key singing, and simplistic 2 chord tune drilled into the ground of a college amateur production.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
A modern musical about those who pursue a Dream,"Lalaland is sad. I don't know what I was expecting from a film that gathered so much attention... Probably I was expecting a lot of music and everyone singing... I was expecting a nice love story and a happy end. And if it was all I got it would be a musical version of ""Notebook"", but things got just a little more complicated. If you want to achieve something you need to sacrifice a lot. I think the main idea behind this film is expressed when they meet after his first concert. I understand perfectly why she reacted the way she did for his first performance in a band and I understand perfectly why he enjoyed what he was not that much into, it was a first success in a path of grim failures... She started to see him as bit of a different person, who betrayed a bit of himself and she felt sort of cheated. But was that the problem really? From my point of view, he always loved her and probably waited for her, right until the end... But did she ? To sum up, don't go to this film with a date, it will leave a bitter feeling.

"It was supposed to have great music but, it falls a little short","Since this movie won two Academy Awards and two Golden Globes for the music, I expected to be devastated by the musical score.Musically, it has some nice songs, but, it did not come close to: 
""The Holiday"", ""Rocky"", ""Secretariat"", ""Superman"", ""Wonder Woman"" and I could name many more.It was more on the order of Moulin Rouge, but even there, musically, it still fell very far short.Story wise, it left, more than a lot to be desired.First, the ending is more like a David Lynch movie and leaves one wondering where the dream ends and the reality is. That is not a major negative, but it is a little annoying.Then of course there is a lot of the story left out near the end, so, it again leaves one wondering, if this is reality...how did we get here.

Dare to dream vs Reality,"I admit it. I had a preconceived perception that this film is overrated and hyped up. Maybe I felt like this because it's a musical. But the truth is that we are dealing with something exceptional. First of all, I'll divide the film into two separate parts. The first is the one which could call ''the musical part''. It's what you expect to watch in a classic musical. But there is a big difference here. The difference is called Damien Chazelle (''Whiplash''). This extremely talented young auteur creates a directing masterpiece. We should regard his work as a directing tutorial. The frames, the one-take moments and of course the brilliant jazz music are working on a perfect way to create a wonderful nostalgic atmosphere which looks alike a hyped 60's romance. Think about all these elements you adore about musicals, in addition with a superb directing. Now the second part is what makes this movie substantial and differentiates it from other musicals. I couldn't have thought, even at the beginning, that this story will be so powerful. The script is the quintessence of motivation, a hymn about dreams. The leading couple, Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone), balance their romance on their dreams and goals. They fall in love just because they inspire and motivate each other. But can this love endure the reality? Or, more essentially, can these utopian dreams overpower reality? Each character has goals and aspirations, but what does it really happen when reality strikes? Damien Chazelle knows how to reflect the right principles about life. La La Land is full of such principles and it turns into a big life-lesson, where Chazelle deciphers daily life and suggests that we dare to dream. Of course, the film won't be successful without the fiery leading duo. I think Emma Stone is a big surprise here with a performance which can be finally considered as first-class. On the other hand, Ryan Gosling is that kind of the actor who performs brilliantly at pretty much everything. Their very chemistry ensures film's success. La La Land is probably the best film of the year. It is realistic and dreamlike at the same time. It is a reflection of reality dressed up in a romantic, artistic, musical and theatrical outfit.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Great Movie with a Confusing Ending,Besides the ending which was personally confusing. It was a very good movie for the most part and I have a very deep appreciation for musicals from watching them with Gene Kelly and Elvis Presley in my childhood. It was also nice to see the main characters have their own personal struggles throughout the movie. I hope to get more musicals like this in upcoming years and I'm able to see them on vacation hopefully.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
If you enjoy watching movies or are interested in the award season of films this is a must see!,"La La Land is Damien Chazelle's most recent project, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. These two actors/actresses have been in a few movies together already, and you can clearly see that in this movie their chemistry in this movie is so good. Their relationship seems so real, it feels like you are a fly on the wall just looking in on two real life people in a real life scenario. This movie will go down as a classic!Let's start with the obvious, the music. It is so great in this film! Some of the greatest song in the modern film era! You will find yourself singing the songs repeatedly in your head, over and over again! And the fact the Ryan Gosling learned the piano just for this movie and played it that well is absolutely astonishing!Another thing I loved about this movie, is the way they pay homage to older musicals, this movie is shot in cinescope and it makes the movie truly beautiful! I really love the way Damien chazelle did the shots in the movie he was able to show the classic musical style in this movie so well!Now that brings me to my next thing I LOVED in this movie and that is Damien Chazelle, he did it again! After his great movie titled ""Whiplash"" he comes back with yet another classic film! He directed this movie so well, all the shots were absolutely perfect, I can't wait to see what he does next!I can't say enough about this movie it is so amazing, if you even slightly like movies you need to see this film!! The performances are so good and the movie really tugs at your heartstrings, and makes you really feel for the characters! And this movie drives home the theme of the dying art in the film industry and it shows that plot so well! I'm giving Damien Chazelle's La La Land a 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"Weightless--as it's meant to be--and not without heart, but this balloon wafts away instead of soars...","One can say many things about writer-director Damien Chazelle's ""La La Land"" and, indeed, the critics' plaudits and accolades have already infiltrated our national consciousness: it's a valentine to movie musicals; it's a musical for people who don't like musicals; it's a feel-good movie for all audiences; it's a tonic for our national malaise. The story--separated into seasonal chapters--is pretty basic: Emma Stone is a barista on the Warner Bros. movie lot who aspires to be an actress but can't get passed the audition phase; Ryan Gosling is a jazz pianist who longs to play his own compositions. They encourage each other to follow their dreams, which doesn't necessarily mean taking the financially lucrative road (although having money in the bank would certainly be an incentive for a better future, even if the 'artistic value' isn't there yet). Yes, Chazelle is in love with movies--he steals enough from the motion picture past to tell us that--and, certainly, the opening musical number on a jammed Los Angeles freeway is full of contagious acrobatic joy and celebration. The trouble is, these two young people aren't willing to compromise (perhaps that would be allowing for too much realism). Chazelle attempts to show us that success doesn't always lead to happiness, yet his protagonists don't see the big picture; starry-eyed, they want instant gratification through artistic expression. The dancing is polished (too polished, I thought) and the early numbers (such as one with Stone and her girlfriends) have a sprightly quality that is old-fashioned in concept and charmingly lacking in pretension. Still, the hardships of a romantic relationship pulled in different directions isn't all that interesting here, mainly because Gosling and Stone seem so charmed and picture-perfect. She trembles with a beginner's desperation during her auditions and is convincingly unhappy when her one-woman show doesn't pan out, but watching her out to dinner with an affluent date and his friends reveals nothing more than a princess eager to try another throne. Gosling has a moment or two when he's able to give us a natural response to a line or situation, but his concern for Stone seldom registers. The brightly-painted film is reaching for a certain height--a plastic paradise, a movie heaven--that will flood us with good feelings in its attempt and break our hearts with its climax. However, if you are not invested in these characters by the midway point, it will all seem like a glossy charade. ** from ****",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"Cinematic Masterpiece, One of the Best Films of the Modern Age","La La Land is simply one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. Coming from someone whose favorite movie of all time is Black Swan, I tend to like darker movies, but this more romantic movie blew most movies I've seen in my lifetime out of the water. At the surface, it's a simple boy-meets-girl love story, but the real magic lies in the artistic direction. I came into this movie expecting a lot due to Chazelle's previous work of art, Whiplash, and I left the theater absolutely satisfied. The way the visual effects, music, and dance play out in this movie make it the masterpiece that it truly is. Emma Stone is the perfect amount of quirky for the lead female role, while Ryan Gosling is the perfect amount of dapper for the lead male role. The two have GREAT chemistry on-screen.

"I really, really wanted to like this","I loved the leads, but was sadly disappointed in the film. The songs were just okay - nothing to write home about. The dancing was just okay. The singing was awful. The whole time I kept thinking - this will pick up and get better in a little while. It never did. It was 2 hours and 8 minutes. That's way too long for a musical with such a weak script and mediocre songs. The film was about two people who want to be in the entertainment business who meet and have a connection (after about three tries).I was looking so forward to seeing this and maybe I built it up too much in my mind and by ALL the hype at awards time. I just felt let down in the end and thought ""that's 2:08 hours of my life I'll never get back."" If you want to see it, rent it at Redbox.I realize this was not supposed to be a musical done by professional singers and dancers, but I go to the movies to be WOWED, not put to sleep. I guess this movie really meant something to people in the industry and about their struggles in making it big, but I am not one of those people.

I am heart broken and Damien Chazelle should 'Apologize'- No Oscars for this one,"Dear Damien, I really had great expectations for this film. I waited for a year to see this film. I was so excited that I walked ten minutes in the rain to go see this film. I am going to tell you what I felt about the film as I watched your film, so that you can learn something from my letter.I was very happy to see the initial traffic jam and the first song. I was thrilled to see what happens next? As soon as the film started, I started to feel there was no story line to keep me interested. There were no plot points. Who wrote this script? I could not relate to Emma Stone's character because there was nothing to look forward to regarding her goal. She was just an aspiring actress who was lost in Los Angeles failing auditions. Whats interesting about that? The film was dis-jointed. It was a big mess.The biggest mistake you made was to cast Ryan Gosling. This actor's face is bland. He is probably angry with someone on the set and it shows on his face. This guy has no expressions on his face. He has no idea how to act in certain scenes. He just keeps his face expression-less so that nobody can relate to him in the film. Deborah Aquila should have helped you find a better actor. Who selected Ryan's wardrobe? There was nothing interesting about his bland clothes to go with the musical. His emotions on his face do not match the flow of the story. Ryan, you are not a face for musical or romance or hero for a romantic comedy. You are a face of a villain or a boxing film. You should do those films. The way the director have these two characters meet is so weak. There was nothing romantic about how they meet. Emma Stone is a good actress but she kept (emotionally)staring in space in lot of scenes which were not removed in editing and it affected her performance. Acting with Ryan Gosling also affected her performance. There was one scene in the film where she goes and stands right in front of movie theater full of audience and nobody reacts or shouts as she stands in front of all of this audience while movie is playing. How unbelievable!I wanted to like something something in this film. I tried very hard. I wanted to like a scene where they are about to hold hands in movie theater but even Damien ruined that romantic scene by doing something stupid. I wont forgive you for that. Then someone gave you a museum to shoot in. You should have made best use of those scenes but you did not. There was nothing exciting about it. There were sound problems with car horns. It was so loud that I had to put fingers in my ears. Out of the blue an African American guy (John Legend) gives Ryan a deal and music contract. There was no development for that plot point. Damien you need to really work hard on screen writing skills. I wonder who gave you money to make this film for such a weak screenplay. At one point the African American guy says to Ryan.. you are pain in the as. Ryan! honestly you are pain in the ....I, so badly wanted to like this film and wanted some scene to touch me but when that moment came where Emma is called back for an audition. I thought she will tell her own story which was so powerful, she tells some aunt's story which made no sense to the story line. What a disaster! Emma says at the end...It hurts a little bit. You know what, I am hurt. I need Damien Chazelle and Ryan Gosling to send me apology letter for making such a bad film which I had to go and see . I was in tears when I left the theater.

What A Lovely Night Indeed,"*MINOR VAGUE SPOILERS BELOW*Chazelle's La La Land not only succeeds at being an outright love letter to the golden age of Hollywood and be able to convey the magic it had, but also succeeds at being a grounded, profound, and genuine depiction of how we aspire for dreams. The film shows another side of how we try to achieve success or how we essentially try to be the best in our craft and passion just like in his previous film ""Whiplash"" (2014), but what's so special about this film is the fact that the dreams of the characters give way for their love to flourish, but at the same time it inevitably sets them apart.The classical and nostalgic backdrop of the film compliments the dream like aesthetic and feel that drips in every scene. From being presented in Cinemascope, to the the Ingrid Bergman wallpaper, to the breathtakingly fitting colorful color palettes, the musical numbers that make you wonder if this film truly is set in the 21st century and the dialogue that is reminiscent of the usual golden age superstars like James Dean and Humphrey Bogart. All in all, this film breathes an atmosphere that truly makes it feel like we are dreaming along with the protagonists and it also makes you want to go back to the times where films weren't bloated with excessive blockbusters or piffle cash grabs and instead bring in the uplifting or melancholy magic that they should truly present. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling bring in their best performances yet, with a triple- threat-esque nature to their performances just like the legendary actors from the golden age of cinema, as both of them truly knew how to sing, dance, and most of all, act. The simple nuances each character bring to screen even in the smallest detail of visual comedy (which people rarely do nowadays), or visual story telling in each scene that makes the audience learn so much about a certain character with just one look or change in their face, this is real acting, show and don't tell. This is the same reason why we remember Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart so much from Casablanca, because they did not need to convey their love through oblivious dialogue, but through one glance at each other and we know it tells countless stories. We immediately know Stone's character ""Mia""'s aspirations as she glances at an actress and see a strong emotion present in her face, she didn't need to say anything more or outright say ""This is my dream!"" through some sort of monologue. This is tremendously subtle and well done acting that we rarely see nowadays. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and stunning in each scene, the locations are incredibly iconic and nostalgic and the back drop of Los Angeles, especially at night, gives the movie an unique feel that will definitely remind you of the golden ages.The story and plot is quite simple, yet layered enough to be such a universal story that anyone can fully grasp or have some sort of relation to. Sure it tells a faithful love story to the usual tropes and stories we saw in the 40s or 50s, but it tells it through the lens of so many specific and realistic aspects of life. The use of jazz once again by Chazelle just like in Whiplash, and of course acting as a profession, helps layer the story to a more grounded level, their dreams. Another way to view this film is to see how it may not have been entirely a love story after all. Sure there is no denying the chemistry and love brought by the two DID EXIST, but in the end it was a story about conflict and compromise and about how sometimes, compromise is walking away from something for each person's benefit no matter how hard it is. The film presents that love can be used as a tool to help you achieve your dreams and how even at the end, if not everything ends up the way it is, you acknowledge and find compromise in that arbitrary feeling and connection of love that helped you in the way. In the film Whiplash, the protagonist had to leave his girlfriend because he thinks that love was a distraction to the goal he needed to achieve, but in La La Land, they explore how love CAN also help you reach the goals you want in life. But in the end, just like most things in life, you cannot have everything and this is why this film is such an honest and inspiring depiction of people who want to aspire for something.In the end, La La Land wasn't just a love letter to the golden age of Hollywood, it was also a love letter to the fools who dream, it's a love letter to anyone who wants to find someone in the crowd who can lift them off the ground, it's a love letter to anyone who may have been discouraged or disheartened in achieving something, it's a love letter to anyone who feels like dancing and singing see themselves flying off with their dreams.Verdict: 9.9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"Nostalgic, colorful and so much fun.","La La Land is a callback to old timey muscial movies infused with fun and technicolor. From the opening scene where we find a group of people stuck on the freeway who suddenly break into song and dance to the closing notes it never forgets why it was made. And that's to entertain and remind us of the Golden Age of cinema when big bombastic musicals were the rage.What really sets this one apart, other than the time it was made, is that the main actors namely Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, aren't necessarily trained singers and dancers. They're capable and they're able to pull it off but there's this note of amateurishness about them. Not a bad thing, in fact it makes this feel a lot more ""real"". We've all had those moments that, for whatever reason, we do a little jig or maybe we sing a bit along to the radio and honestly most people don't have any training in these things. So it's refreshing when somebody who isn't a pro does so.Color also plays a big part in this. You can see it from the opening scene where everybody is dressed in bright, solid colors as they sing and dance along the freeway to when the girls go out to a party, each in their own brightly colored dress. It evokes the old films that were filmed in technicolor where everything was bright and colorful simply because they could show such a thing.The story follows two individuals. One is a musician who is in love with jazz and dreams of opening his own jazz club. The other is a struggling actress who loves old cinema. Again, these are call backs to older movies and musicals. It follows them through their life as they chase their dreams and fall in love. It's all rather charming and it leads to a conclusion that a lot of people found offputting but I felt suited the tone rather well.It's a shame this didn't win the oscar but it did win multiple awards so that's something.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Arguably the best film of 2016,"""This is the dream! It's conflict and it's compromise, and it's very, very exciting! ""Sebastian (Ryan Gosling)Sebastian, a jazz pianist with ambitions to start his own club in LA, pretty much sums up the thematic heft of La La Land, a contemporary musical that evokes the golden age of Hollywood. Together with Mia (Emma Stone), who aspires to be an actress and playwright, the two embody the dreams of young people then and now, crystallized in Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, with Gene Kelly thrown in for good measure.The opening musical number sets the joyous mood by breaking into song and dance during one of the monumental LA traffic delays on 405. It's choreographed with eye opening color and mirth, an appropriate antidote to LA's notorious torture chamber. However, all is not sunny Hollywood, for the dramatic arc takes us through the difficult times this radiant couple must endure while pursuing love in a loveless land.This joy and sorrow is directed by Whiplash's brilliant director-writer, Damien Chazelle, whose devotion to the spirit of '40's and '50's Hollywood dream factory is matched by his willingness to portray its vicissitudes and not end just the way you would have expected. The integrity of this film lies in his showing the power of ambition and the unwavering sacrifice to fulfill it.Besides Chazelle, the success of this winner lies at the feet of Stone and Gosling, whose song and dance are not perfect, all the better, but so romantic that it is hard to believe they are not professional musical actors, and maybe more to the point, not romantically involved. Yes, their chemistry is that good.La La Land has already received wide acclaim, and rightfully so. It refreshes the musical genre of old Hollywood, and it reminds us ""we are such stuff as dreams are made on.""",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
love letter to Hollywood,"Mia Dolan (Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress just like her roommate friends and the multitudes of beautiful girls in Hollywood. Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) is obsessed with traditional jazz and opening his own pure jazz club. He is often his own worst enemy. The two have a combative, cutest of meet-cutes ""I Ran"". She leaves her boyfriend. He tries to grow up for her and accepts a place in his friend Keith (John Legend)'s band. They struggle to chase their dreams.This is a love letter to Hollywood especially the Golden Age of old Hollywood. The movie had a quick rise leading up to an infamous night at the Oscars and an almost as quick of a backlash. The complaints of cliché, hokey, and less than epic singing and dancing from the leads are all fitting to some extend. The problem is that those complaining are actually missing the point. Firstly, Stone and Gosling are perfect cast with their try-hard, glee-loving, pure-loveliness personalities. They are not the best singers or dancers. They are the high school drama kids who made it big. They are drama geeks and that's exactly what this movie is about. It's drama geek heaven. It revels in the old Hollywood clichés. I especially love the poignant ending. This is happiness in celluloid form.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Damien Chazelle does it again.,"Firstly, I've got to start off by saying I am not a fan of musicals or romantic films, in fact I've never completed a single one. With that said, this film was just a delight to watch, a treat from start to finish.You're probably wondering why I went to see this film after declaring myself to not be a fan of musicals and romantic films. That would be down to the fact that this film was directed by Damien Chazelle, the mastermind behind Whiplash (2014). He demonstrated his ability to create meaning through sound and cinematography in that film. Chazelle asserts his talents in La La Land, creating vibrant images that hold your attention.The second reason is simple, the wonderful trailers. I tried to not look into this film too much or reading about it online. The teaser trailer gave me enough insight as to what to expect, but boy was I in for a treat.The narrative is simple, Sebastian and Mia meet, perhaps through unconventional means at first, and fall in love. There are many layers to this story however and it most definitely has a lot of heart. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have wonderful chemistry and both are extremely quirky and personable. The film has heart, through comedic moments (that work), gorgeous and lavish set designs and the beautiful soundtrack. The numbers work and part of me now wishes people would just break out and dance on the motorways, much like the film portrays. I enjoyed how the film presented the struggles of relationships and handled them in what I would argue is a realistic manner. The camera work is extremely efficient in providing information about characters. For instance, a simple wide shot of an isolated character walking down the street in the film told me a lot of what the director wanted to show.Overall, this film was one of the most enjoyable films I've seen in recent times, if not the best. It really demonstrates the wide array of films out there, even in genres you may not expect. I can't wait to see Damien Chazelle's project, First Man. La La Land was a truly unique experience, one that I do not regret going to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Chazelle is getting his due applause one film late,"Damien Chazelle is very talented. The bouquets he is getting for this film ought to have come instead for his previous work ""Whiplash"" --a far superior work.""La la land"" will appeal to those who have worked hard to achieve their dreams. ""Whiplash"" was more complex with darkness and light (Chazelle's forte) utilized to the hilt. In ""La la land,"" it was replaced by lush color, often helped by the clothes worn.It's mushy--the actors look good always. The music appeals to you but is it all that great? No.This is mere escapism. ""Whiplash"" on the other hand was real and deserved better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Nope,"Surprised that people feel this is a fitting homage to great prior musicals. Much as I LOVE Ryan Gosling and admire Emma Stone, they do not hold a candle stub to great dancers and singers like Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Gene Kelly, Cyd Charisse, Judy Garland, John Travolta.Both Gosling and Stone are adequate dancers, okay, but just not in the same class as the aforementioned. And both have embarrassingly weak voices...yes, sometimes their weaknesses border on the touching, but give me Ethel Merman, or Bing Crosby or Ethel Waters or Hoagy Carmichael. And if you like touchingly amateur song delivery, check out Toni Erdmann.Add to their lack of musical talent and only adequate dancing the weak plot and the shallow characterizations and you might, like the three people I saw it with, emerge from the theater downcast and glum.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Even Van Gogh would love it,"One of the best cinematic experience of the decade. What makes a great movie great is a team and its packaging - screenplay, cinematographer, music, choreographer, dress, hair stylist, director and producer. La la Land is one of the such movies that has complete package.Every frames and scene, and screenplay remind of work of purist who finds the lost dream. The scene of dancing among stars, or singing during sunset, or climax scene, the Damien Chazelle's work is art will be a landmark cinema in itself.If you're jazz fan, do watch it. If you're not a jazz fan, you do not miss it.--",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Sweet and Fun with a Powerful Fantasy Sequence,"""La La Land"" is a fun, sweet movie about two young artists, their attempt to establish their careers, and their love affair. It's enjoyable but not the masterpiece reviews insist it is.Mia (Emma Stone) is a barrista and an aspiring actress. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a jazz pianist. They meet during a traffic jam, get together at a party, and go through the ups and downs of young people who are in love and who are also chasing artistic success.""La La Land"" is a musical. People sing and dance. That's fun. Neither Stone nor Gosling is a professional singer or dancer, so the singing and dancing are mediocre.Mia and Sebastian go for a walk at night. Their walk is cinematically reminiscent of a walk that Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse take in the 1953 movie musical, ""Band Wagon"" – to the tune of ""Dancing in the Dark.""Just like Fred and Cyd, Mia and Seb begin their nighttime walk as bickering enemies, but during the dance they warm up to each other. They dance under trees and streetlights. The difference is that Gosling and Stone can't begin to match the magic that professional dancers like Astaire and Charisse conjure in their dance number. Gosling's voice is barely there.In another scene, Stone sings what might have been a show-stopping number, a song about her free-spirited aunt who lived in Paris and went swimming in the River Seine. During this song, Stone wears a non- descript, baggy sweater and she barely moves. Stone is very compelling as an actress. As a singer, especially during this number, she falls flat.Damien Chazelle's direction doesn't highlight the dance numbers as it might. The opening scene depicts an LA traffic jam. Passengers emerge from their cars and dance on the highway. They sing a lyric-dense song; you can't hear them over the music in order to make out the words. It's frustrating. Their movements are not flattered by Chazelle's camera.Even so, I very much enjoyed ""La La Land."" Its strengths would have been evident whether anyone had been singing or not. ""La La Land"" brings home how hard it is for struggling artists to nurture healthy relationships. Mia and Sebastian live in poverty. At one point he looks at a water stain on the ceiling and despairs. They are crushed when their best efforts meet with failure. They are tempted to sell out. Their careers demand that they not be present for each other for months at a time. Mia and Sebastian let each other down.""La La Land"" drags after a bit. Stone and Gosling are virtually the only characters in the film. Their key interactions are repeated. ""La La Land"" redeemed itself, for me, in a final, fantasy sequence that was incredibly poignant and true and that was unlike anything else I'd ever seen in any other film. I'd recommend seeing ""La La Land"" for that sequence alone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Uncontrollable jealousy towards filmmakers,"I was not a big fan of musicals.
I basically did not like to watch such a huge popular films...However, LaLaLand is different from any other movies.
This shows the positive and negative sides of creators, artists, and performers with such a soft, moody, and beautiful ways.It was my first time to have felt strong jealousy toward everyone who got involved with this great movie when I was watching end roll.

It's alright,"This film tells the story of a budding actress, who goes to audition after audition trying to get her break. She meets a jazz musician who is also waiting for a break in his career.Looking at the ratings and the number of award nominations it has gathered, I thought it would be amazing. Indeed, the first scene of the traffic jam in the highway is great, as it is a continuous shot of people singing and dancing on the highway. After that, such musical number if far and few in between. The story is slow and drags on, fortunately the subplot about how they have to follow their dreams somehow strikes a chord with the audience. There is a number of songs that are good, but I expected more songs and less dialogues for a musical.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
An ode to old Hollywood,"There is just something about La la Land. This is on a surface level a generic ""go for the gold"" story, but the way it tells it´s story, it´s characters, it´s production. All coming together to create a marvelous and beautiful movie.Two artist find each other and most navigate ups and downs in their carriers in Hollywood.The weakest part to me for this movie is it´s see through script. Too many times I can just hear the writer tell me what he thinks about the industry and art. Not the characters, but the writer. There are too many ""I think this"" lines and they can at times be a bit too pretentious. Sure, we can all think highly of art and see it as more than work, but come on, it´s not that black or white.Emma Stones performance is great in this movie. Her singing alone always moves me and she is incredibly charming in the role.This is an ode to old Hollywood musicals in so many ways. The production design is incredible. The different sets really stick out and they fell build in a charming and old way. The different colors and uses of them, how everything pops, how incredible the choreography is, how it´s both real and dreamlike at the same time. The production is just incredible and a love letter to the old Hollywood traditions.The music is so good as well as the songs. The great use of jazz and therefore horns and piano, creates great music at all times. And the songs are all memorable and so catchy. You´ll walk around humming any of the songs days after. This is a great musical.The visual storytelling is also incredible. So many feelings are shown purely visually and through great means of color and fantasy. The music also helps. The ending sequence is still incredible and combines everything the movie does great into one amazing ending.It´s a story about art and integrity. How art can fell hollow, how hard it is to live of passion, how you can fell like art is being misused and how great ideas can be forgotten by something in. I don't agree with everything the movie says, but I think it´s message is beautiful and executed well.La la Land is a delight and so well done. It´s a technical and production marvel and so well done. The story is good and believable. Overall you are gonna walk away laughing, crying, cheering and hoping after watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
The musical masterpiece of the century...,"If you've only just heard about La La Land, you may be wondering what all the song and dance is about. But if you've been tracing its trajectory for a while, you'll know that song and dance is the whole idea.The delectable new film from Damien Chazelle – winner of seven Golden Globes, recipient of 11 Bafta nominations, and the expected winner of the 89th Academy Award for Best Picture – is a musical. And not just any old musical, but the twirling, soaring kind that was last in style in the 1960s heyday of Jacques Demy, when Catherine Deneuve and Françoise Dorléac swished down sun-drenched boulevards in sorbet- coloured mini dresses, trilling glistening jazz-pop numbers that imprint themselves on your heart in one go.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Maybe I'm just too old, but I really don't know what all the fuss is about. The whole thing was way to flat for my taste, and I don't mean the good, silly kind of flat :) Guess dull is the word I'm looking for .",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"I cried the entire way home after watching it, out of joy.","I was awaiting this one with rather great tension, and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest.I will not talk about the musical - story ratio, how well written the female main character is or why I slapped the first person who insulted this movie in my proximity. What I will say is that I was never touched like this by any other work of art. This masterpiece takes itself very, very seriously. It takes its time to deliver the best paced love story I have witnessed, every single act being its own short, supported by almost stupidly well written and performed music as well as jokes which weren't even remotely out of place. Additionally, and by no means I want to undercut the other actors, Emma Stone delivered a performance which simply blew me away. Just 10 minutes in I was absolutely convinced this will grant her an Oscar, thankfully that was eventually the case.The movie is long, and the songs require your attention, especially when watching in a different language. That makes it very hard to endure if you have a short attention span or just didn't enter the cinema with maximum interest to begin with.In any other case, in my opinion, this is the movie of the century.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
A Fun But Overrated Musical,"Perhaps it was all the hype, but I came away from viewing ""La La Land"" a bit underwhelmed. Yes, it was a fun film with some heart, and the whole family can enjoy it. It does remind you of films from Hollywood's better days. How often do we get to see a script-to- screen musical? I understand that some members of the academy perhaps wanted to encourage more of this kind of film making, and I'd like to see more as well. That said, this is not a great film. It does have it's moments. The story is bittersweet, and the cinematography is wonderful -- LA hasn't looked this good in a long time. I enjoyed the music, especially the theme track. There's a lot of energy in this film, and it keeps you interested from beginning to end. But I don't think the final product deserves all the Oscars, even if I've never thought much of them anyway. Everything is done well, even really well at times. The lead actors are earnest and likable. We're rooting for them, but it doesn't add up in the end. I found the progression of the plot in the final 30 minutes to be a bit of a stretch. These two were never really meant for each other. I found their friendship much more believable than their romance. Neither actor is a skilled dancer, musician, or singer. They pulled it off, but their performances aren't memorable. Viewing La La Land was a fun two hours, but I'm not interesting in watching it a second time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Good actors in really trash booooring movie,"I'm completely baffled on all the hype around this, the awards. And it beats me why people write those 10-star reviews.I love these actors, music, musicals, old and new settings, classics, good jazz, romance -- practically everything that was used to mix up this film. Yet it fell short of being enjoyable by a mile. Or ten.The musical part has just one song really. And while it returns 3-4 times can't carry a 2+ hours sitting. And there are good parts, not even few, but put together add up to maybe 15 minutes. Definitely less than 20.2016 was a really bad year for cinema, but even there 15% good content can not put you on the short list. Or the long list.Also it looks like shot directly for iPad watching. Nothing in it requires to be in a movie theater. And beyond a handful of minutes of piano and jazz parts even speakers are not to be missed.So if you absolutely want to watch it, I recommend do it at home equipped with food, partner, other distractions and a fast-forward button. But if you skip it altogether, you hardly lose anything either.Real shame wasting all that talent, and more so fueling the hype and reinforcing the bad trend that keeps actually good pictures from being financed.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

La La Land is a glorious throwback to classic Hollywood,"Why do we even go to movies anymore? Damian Chazelle's latest movie La La Land is a perfect answer to that question. The sensational and intoxicating movie musical is one of the year's best.La La Land stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gossling and tells the story of a struggling actress in Hollywood trying to make it big and a struggling Jazz musician who dreams of one day opening up his own Jazz club. As fate would have it, they meet and begin to date.There was a time where musicals ruled the film industry. Starting in the 50s and going through the 60s. musicals dominated Hollywood. Soon, the genre began to fizzle out and since then, we've only had a number of musicals a year, if any. While the quantity and quality of musicals have dropped significantly, be assured, that La La Land is without a doubt a return to form for the genre and is the best movie musical since Singin' in the Rain. Whether or not you are a fan of musicals, it will pierce your soul and put a smile on your face.From the incredible opening number to the very end, La La Land is an absolute masterful and euphoric experience. It's the kind of movie that audiences deserve to see every time they step into the theatre. Just by watching the trailer, you can get a sense of the wonder and joy the movie brings. It's heartwarming, beautiful and sensational. It's a delight from beginning to end.The opening number is a beautiful and jaw dropping one-shot dance sequence directed perfectly by Damian Chazelle. Chazelle is the main reason this movie works so well. Nearly every song and dance sequence is filmed in beautiful long-takes that really showcase the choreography. It's jaw-dropping at times.Emma Stone gives the best performance of her entire career. She is absolutely perfect in this movie. Her performance is so real and so raw. Performances like hers are a rare find and there is something just so heartfelt about it. Her chemistry with Ryan Gossling is perfect. Ryan Gossling is also very good in the movie and gives one of his best performances.The musical score and dance numbers are dazzling and beautiful to behold. There is one scene near the middle of the movie that takes place in a observatory and the entire sequence is absolutely breathtaking. The choreography and metaphoric visuals are beautiful.La La Land is a rare movie that begs to be seen. Movies like this just aren't made anymore. It's a love letter to Los Angeles, to Hollywood, to film, to musicals. If you love movies, don't miss out on this one. La La Land one of the best movies of the year. If you only see one movie this year, this is the one to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

There is not a song from the movie that I came out humming or singing. If Emma Stone wins for Best Actress in this movie, it would only show me how weak this the category may be this year. (But, I haven't seen Arrival or Elle so I don't know about these movies.)As I watched this movie, I did think about Les parapluies de Cherbourg (1964), but that movie was a modern opera and La La Land (2016) comes no where near that great Michel Legrand work of yesteryear.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

The opening was one of the best tracking shots I seen in a movie comparable to The Third Man(1958), along with some other scenes in the movie that I was impressed with. The music didn't over weigh the plot, and the it made sense within the story(especially in Ryan Goslings case)I enjoyed this film, and could recommend it to anyone willing to give musicals a shot.

Pure Movie-Making,"I'm not a expert on musicals , The only classic movie musical I've seen is Singing in the rain , I can't say i liked it very much. It all seemed too simple , too clean, dare I say, Too romantic . It did satirize aspects of the film industry , but that's it.
Where this movie wins me over is with it's layer of modern story-telling. it's messy , It's complicated but at the same time it's pure film-making in my mind . There's no unnecessary baggage bringing the film down, which is what I loved about Damien Chazelle's other film Whiplash.It feels personal but not in a obsessive way. It's joyous , but not in a pretentious or oblivious way . I'm what you'd call a cynic, but this film brought a smile on my face, But at the same time, left me sad and melancholy (In a good way)
Another thing is I really like the music in the film. The songs and the score are just awesome to listen to if you're in a good mood and go perfectly with the film.
This film is not for everybody, not everyone will enjoy this film or have the same experiences with the film as I had , Specially if you didn't catch it in the theater . My hope is that people just give it a Shot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Who rates this stuff???,"Sorry, I had to give it a 1 to counter the people who gave this a 10.My wife and I went to see this movie based on ratings. It isn't really a very good anything. It had no memorable songs. It didn't have any singers to mention. Sorry, the main actors are not singers.The drama part may have been the best where we find that following your dream takes away from REAL people and real relationships so in that way it was sad, so sad.Calling this a comedy is wrong. Only once in the theater did I hear others laughing and that was only for a brief moment. Maybe is was the kind of people in the audience. My wife and I were talking about where is PeeWee Herman and the two guys in front of us told us to shush during where Ryan was whistling on the pier. Really? Did we take away from the whistle sound track that much guys? Don't think I missed the two times the piano was not played correctly either. However one of the grand's was nicely tuned. That may have been the best part of the movie. You got to hear the difference between a real piano and an electronic one.

Lala land and freedom,"Lala land is one of the most awarded pictures of all times, and it comes to us in a time when the world is in such state with religious, political, economical and social wars that contribute to the world crisis.The movie is based on a young girl that wants to make it in the movie business. Life in Hollywood with the constant chase for a major roll and to have a life changing experience and become famous. All she needs is one chance to change her destiny.As we watch the movie with all the colours and music we can appreciate what life is through jazz. Its music takes us to another level where we try to fight for our survival, to have our 5 seconds of solo (fame) and then to mingle with the other instruments that complement our purpouse in existence. Life is about being in the world with all the kind of people that makes us hear they way we sound.The parallelism in both lives, the struggle, the dreams, the project and the talent shows us that anyone can do it. But if we aren't willing to share the dream and make sacrifices, then we may travel different. That is what happens to the main characters, they fell in love, but didn't share any of their passions to make it work. That's why we see two versions of their love life, what you are willing to give to be successful.The taste of freedom in this movie shows us the things we choose in the present affects the things to come in the future.

the making of an american artist,"While presenting the audience with spectacular sceneries, La La Land instills American ideology in them. Enclosing a cliché chick flick with the form of musical, La La Land, just like its predecessor Whiplash, is essentially about the director Chazelle's perception of the making of an artist.According to what Chazelle has implies in La La Land, if you want to become an artist in modern America, you have to 1. be talented; 2. chase your dreams; 3. wait to be discovered by discerning art people; 4. enjoy your success as a bourgeois, now that you got everything you wanted. During this process you will be lonely much of the time. Few people in your life would you get along with. They all talk about parties, world politics and business, the things you do not quite care. Art is the only thing you are passionate about. In La La Land, neon lights always surround the leads. Their art, their dream and their love are elevated and glorified through the whole film. Even the whole universe serves as the background for this love. As their lives are filled with philistines, we witness two artist wannabes against the world.What Chazelle has understood as the making of an artist is fundamentally a clumsy fusion of the myth of great artists and the age-long American dream. In the former talent always triumphs, though the artists are never properly appreciated by their contemporaries. Consider the cases of van Gogh, who cut his whole ear off, and Gauguin, who, according to Maugham, left home for an island to draw inspiration. In the latter hard work is always rewarded well. Chazelle uncritically absorbs the two ways of making an artist, ignoring all logistical loopholes. After all, life and arts are among the few things that could not be made successful simply through hard work.Convinced by the concept of American dream, Chazelle is an American patriot at heart. He sets his film in Los Angeles, and he alludes to the distinct American classics -- jazz, musicals, and Rebel Without a Cause. As well as elevating the two young artists, Chazelle is also elevating these American cultural icons he loves. The problem is the film implies a problematic understanding of high art, pop culture and sociopolitical context. By making fun of vulgar people, Chazelle categorically dismisses any value of pop hits. But jazz was a treasure for suffering African American people. Musicals appealed to a wide range of audience for its hedonistic qualities. Rebel Without a Cause is a hymn of discontented youths who struggle to find larger significance for their mundane lives. None of these seem to qualify as the kind of high art Chazelle emulates in this film, and Chazelle, a Harvard graduate, fails to understand the campy nature of James Dean's performance that makes Rebel Without a Cause a cult classic of all time. In the end, La La Land is just another film about self-absorbed art people set in Los Angeles. The more it strives for a status of classic, the more it reveals its propagandist nature.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"La La Land is an impressive, magical experience that shows that movie musicals are capable of","A lot of major cities have a lot of hidden history. The majority of it can be found in books and the Internet, but there are some things right in front of you. Take a city like Los Angeles, that has plenty of history with Hollywood and the impact that it's made on the film industry. Buy a map to the starts and you'll probably be able to find the Chinese Theater, Paramount studios, and the Brown Derby hat. What a lot of those maps don't show is that many elements from Hollywood's heyday are still around like certain theaters, homes, and even murals. You just have to look for them.Today's film pays plenty of tributes. Old Hollywood is just a part of that. La La Land is like a wave of nostalgic feeling from a time where musicals were part of the movie going season; and I mean an original musical. When's the last time that you remember a musical that was not based off of a Broadway play (not counting animated movies)? It's been a while and to sell one in today's time, it would have to offer something we've haven't seen before. La La Land brings back the original musical.Mia (played by Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress who works as a barista for an on studio coffee shop. The few auditions she's given are either stopped after one line or interrupted by someone who clearly feels more important then her. At the same time, jazz musician Sebastian (played by Ryan Gosling) is having problems with money and trying to get work that'll allow him to play the improvisational music that he prefers. A gig at a restaurant only allows him to play Christmas music, but he tries his hand at a beautiful melody that doesn't catch the eye of a lot of people. It does so of Mia who happened to discover it by chance.The two are initially not introduced that evening, but they encounter reach other months later at a party. The two strike up a friendship which ranges from Sebastian taking her to a jazz bar to curve her interest in the genre to a screening of Rebel Without a Cause. This eventually blooms into a romance as the two move in together and continue to chase the Hollywood dreams of making a mark within the world of entertainment.I'll say right off the back that La La Land is one of the best, most entertaining movies of 2016. I expect this to be a major hit with everyone, even those that don't typically watch musicals. This is a rare musical where I can recall all the songs being great. ""City of Stars"", ""Another Day of Sun"" and ""Start a Fire"" are all candidates for the best song Oscar. Director Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) clearly loves older music as jazz is given a bigger spotlight here then before. The tunes plays by Ryan Gosling and John Legend (who also plays a part in the story) are just delightful.La La Land is also one of the best made movies of the year. It takes several cues from Martin Scorsese as many of the scenes, especially the musical sequences, are done with long takes. This made me realize just how too often modern-musicals rely on editing to make the shooting easier. La La Land shows the hard work the actors went through to make each step and tap flawless. When editing is present, it pays homage to movies of the 1950s. How does it do that? I really don't want to give anything away.I'll give this ten old Hollywood murals out of ten. If 2016 has brought down your spirits, then La La Land will bring them back up. I highly recommend this to everyone! This is a fantastic work of art that justifies much of the hidden history and beauty our world holds to us. Dance your way to a screening of this and sing a long if you wish.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

La Laclassic!,"Writer-Director Damien Chazelle is very well on his way to cinematic greatness with yet another arousing movie depicting his love for jazz music, with an inspiring narrative including characters' quest for their professional dreams to come true.

This instant Hollywood musical classic called ""La La Land"" stars Ryan Gosling as Sebastian, he is a struggling Jazz musician residing in Los Angeles who dreams of opening his own jazz club. Emma Stone also stars as Mia, she is the struggling actress who dreams of making it big in Tinsletown like Emma Stone herself, confused? Well, one thing ""La La Land"" is not, is confusing. Sebastian and Mia meet and ""La La Land"" comes alive feverishly and I am not dreaming when I say that these two together are one of the best movie character couplings of all time. ""La La Land"" is a beautiful film, and a love letter to classic Hollywood. Chazelle marvels with his stylish direction and orchestration of the picture. His screenplay was a musical gem of art. Ryan Gosling was outstanding as Sebastian, but it was Emma Stone as Mia that please ""mamma Mia"" must get an Oscar nomination for her brilliant performance.

For fans of musicals,"La La Land since its release has received a lot of praise and due from critics and award shows, having earning several Oscar awards as well as other prestigious awards. Just as with every film that received high praise from critics and wins a ton of awards, there will be a lot of backlash and critics among casual movie goers alike. For those whom don't like too much musicals may not enjoy this film as this film offers plenty in that area. The story is well decent and the acting and visuals complete it. La La Land is quite decent but the story is something in which we have seen before (at times the film reminds of a musical version of the Notebook). Was not much of a fan of some of the musicals they had as one found them to be not as interesting and forgettable. Overall, if you are not a fan of old fashion type musicals, or predictable romance stories, La Land Land may not be for you, as one should not try to force the film to enjoy it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Visceral hatred for a con job,"If a producer is going to deconstruct a genre, the producer owes it to the audience to warn them early on (like in ""Purple Rose of Cairo"" or ""Unforgiven""). This film, which has been lavishly praised, earns my visceral hatred because it did not do so, and I frankly cannot recall a movie which has ever triggered that sort of reaction even though I have seen thousands of them.I went to this movie because I was in the mood for a warm, ""feel good"" movie. The promo's and a goodly part of the film deliver that ""feel good"" warmth, like The Artist, but this time, as an updated classic song-and-dance film of the 1930's to 1950's. You can also see the homages, like those to Astaire/Rodgers and Kelly, as well as a knowing glance to a key scene in ""Rebel Without a Cause"". Sounds just like what I wanted.But about two-thirds of the way through, something begins to change (no spoilers here). The crack widens until the end, which at least one review has called bittersweet. For me, I felt rage. I got conned, without warning, into seeing the kind of movie I did not want to see. So you bet I'm angry.In terms of the mechanics, the film does not quite follow the basic lines of an early song-and-dance musical. Invariably, there is a secondary subplot involving different characters who, depending on the film, build tension, contrast, or comic relief. None of that existed here, although there were some opportunities which never bore fruit. Perhaps some more false leads by the writer? I saw them as distracting dead ends.There are also a number of plot holes which are annoying, a couple of which involve cell phones and unexchanged cell phone numbers that would have happened in real life. Any musical expects people to suspend disbelief, but the suspension of disbelief is generally in the musical parts, not the narrative.Two of the best parts of the movie were the acting by the two leads-- excellent. They were also game at the singing and dancing, and clearly worked darn hard to do a great job. But to be honest, Gosling's singing (a presumed effort to mimic Astaire's approach) was not good, and Stone's dancing didn't hold a candle to a really trained, talented dancer (like the lead in the opening number).You can make musicals which have twists, like the ending in West Side Story, but they don't pretend to be homages--they make it clear, up front, they are something different. So, for ruining my Sunday afternoon, I give this movie a 1.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

This is Cinema!,"""Jazz - Let it die, it had its time. Well, not on my watch!"" For the majority of the movie buffs in India, who barely know anything about Jazz music (which includes me too) that line wouldn't make much impact. But embark on the 2-hour musical voyage of 'La La Land', feel the time freezing around you while Sebastian presses the keys to his piano one by one in the end, and you would seriously reconsider your stand on it. Jazz would barge into your playlists and hearts with ease!Like the bits and pieces that we carry from movies like 'Titanic', 'Casablanca', 'A Beautiful Mind', 'The 'Pulp Fiction', 'Dark Knight Rises', or take any other all-time classics for an instance, there are a whole lot of elements in 'La La Land' too that would win an eternal life in your memories.It's a magical blend of the following concepts – success that comes with a price, the beauty and liberty in Jazz that the musicians are trying to rescue from extinction, love that's governed by the universal laws, drama that isn't so dramatic but sweet and unbelievably beautiful with insanely vivid shots, the art of dreaming and the life through a musical kaleidoscope, and so many! It's pure magic. Mia and Sebastian will make you stoned with their dreams, music and love. You might cry like a baby at the end of it – not because of the story, but for the perfect blend of something that the world of cinemas has long forgotten.Two parallel, but very different streams of realizing the dreams that starts at a common point, but having no confluence and only a hard-hitting end, which is hard to digest!About the two streams: One reminds us of a line from the book The Alchemist' by Paulo Coelho, ""The miner was about to give it all up, right at the point when, if he were to examine just one more stone – just one more – he would find his emerald.""And the second is a story of success through sacrifice that's part and parcel of certain decisions; they are the game-changers, but you can't actually judge if it's good and bad. It's life - the art and beauty of pain that makes for a melancholy.Mia – I never knew Emma Stone was so talented. If Jennifer Lawrence won an Oscar, I think 'Mia' in 'La La Land' shouldn't even be challenged this time. Hollywood has the firepower, I have realized and I have madly fallen in love with 'Mia'! (Futile, I know)Sebastian, a gift from God that fell into Ryan Gosling's laps. With his nonchalant yet musical expressions, he will show you that this is the role he was born to do!Well, every shot is beautiful, and even if it is irritatingly pink and candy at times, you wouldn't care! This is CINEMA without the privilege of RETAKES, depending only on sheer talent, and perfection through hard-work and practice!I don't think I have done justice to this write-up, and I seriously think 'language' should give writers unprecedented liberty to come up with new words and phrases to expresses themselves when it comes to movies like this!

Everything mixed up with a tender love story half real half dreamed between a jazz pianist and a girl who is trying to start a life as an actress.

For instance the opening sequence of a collective dance on a road filled with cars during a traffic jam is wonderful indeed. A movie to be loved, almost a masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
La La Land,"Recently filmmaker Ridley Scott admitted that he found the current state of cinema to be declining and even himself admitted to being asked numerous times to be a director, or somehow involved in any number of superhero related movies. Thankfully to this day he has not done so and while some of his choices as a director, or producer tend to be a little perplexing and leaving the viewer wondering why he did said project, I think he may be on to something with the general statement that cinema does seem to be declining in quality and what would have played on the big screen even 30 to 40 years ago, is not the same today and that same level of expertise, artistry and quality just doesn't seem to be there a lot of the time. Jean-Luc Godard once famously said that cinema began with D.W. Griffith and ends with Abbas Kiarostami. With the unfortunate passing of Kiarostami this past year, does that mean cinema is definitely gone for good? In some ways yes, but then again on the other hand you have a film like La La Land which is very much in the same kind of style and spirit of the movies of yesterday while being completely original on it's own, so maybe in a sense there is still hope for today's cinema yet. Within the first ten to fifteen minutes of La La Land, I really was not anticipating that I would end up liking the film as much as I did. The film started out with bubbly and very much pop flavoured dance and musical numbers that seemed so happy and bright that I felt that if the whole movie was this upbeat and sunny than I probably should have seen something else at the theatre instead because what I was witnessing was so sickeningly sweet that it would even turn most kids who grow up on that stuff off of it. Thankfully however the trailers I had seen for the film as well as everything else I knew about it proved to be true and that wasn't the kind of film this was going to be. Instead we do have a film that in it's own way is trying to recapture the magic and charm of the movies that generations ago people grew up on and films and music that we should be watching today instead of the countless hours we throw away on mindless entertainment and games with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The film loves old Hollywood from the movies to the actors to the big budget musicals of yesteryear. It also pays homage to music such as the jazz classics that I know any die hard jazz fan would go head over feet over. In a sense those also attuned to movies with a more European feel (think the French New Wave of the 50's and 60's) will also most likely find a lot to like here as well because this film is not simply just plagiarizing these movies and cultural icons of old, but instead borrows from their styles and techniques and as I said earlier, they make a movie all their own using those trademark pieces of style and music and they do so in a way that is pulled off to perfection and will leave even the hardest of film critics longing for movies from decades ago pretty pleased at what still proves to be talent and good work with movies and filmmakers in this current generation. The film is more than anything else a love story between two people who often at first seem completely at odds with each other, but with any good romance, sometimes the opposites do attract and can lead to magic. The film also incorporates old Hollywood and the fact that many classic films and even styles of music are dying because today's generation is different. People are now so into themselves, or their electronic devices that they no longer have the interest, or curiosity about the true arts anymore. I once had a film professor acquaintance who told me that in his university film class that the students he had did not want to see older movies, but things that were current, or modern at least to them. How incredibly sad. La La Land reaches out to those lost arts and shows us that these forms of art definitely need to stay alive and need to be rediscovered by each and every generation. The film also details the struggles of trying to make it in the arts scene and with all the rejections and disappointments you get, sometimes it definitely is hard to keep your chin up. However these characters have perseverance and will give it everything they got and ultimately prove that dreams can happen and sometimes with a little help you get not just get what you want, but maybe something better is lying just around the corner for you. La La Land has a lot of style, the musical numbers are all very well done and it's a film with some great character development and it truly will be relatable to this generation, but countless others as well. This is a film of originality that proves that Hollywood is not dead yet, nor is film and we might just have a few surprises left from some up and coming filmmakers, so with films like La La Land, Hollywood and film is still alive and thriving for now at least which I think is a great place to be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

What the La La?,"I've joined the hype train and I got really burned. This film was mostly bad. How in the world it won so many awards?First of all, E S and R G can't sing to save their lives. E S got only one song which she really sang using her chest voice and I don't really think it was her voice because of the discrepancy of what she sang previously up to that point. This film has no plot. It's like a musical version of Fifty Shades of Grey without the ""action"", distilled for kids, reaching really cringe-worthy moments. The love story is a Hollywood cliché, sterile and devoid of any real meaning or connection to reality.I'm really confused about the music, since this is what I've been doing for the past twenty years to make a living. Most of the songs are somewhat immature in the composition manner while their arrangements are quite beautiful. They are not close to how a true pedigree musical should sound like. They feel like the cheap version for a true musical, especially considering that the film goes to great lengths to substitute the ineptitude of the lead actors / singers with many many instrumental parts that most of the time feel inadequate, even though the orchestration and the mixing, in theory, is flawless. The whole movie revolves around just one melodic motif which gets overused really fast. Most of the arrangements are well executed, yet simplistic in manner with mostly appearance over essence. It's like reading a children's book. For me, that illustrates overreaching, without the necessary experience or profoundness to fully grasp the important concepts one is trying to say. The elements that constitute the movie just don't synergize good enough with each other to make it work. However there are several jazz arrangements that stand out of the crowd, and there's even a pop song which is pretty dope. I think it was the high point of the movie.The film digs deep into its technicality to recreate the look and feel of the golden age of American cinematography. It uses almost all the tricks in the book: they dress the extras in very earthy colors and the leads in bright and vivid colors so they can really stand out, the use of silhouettes, a lot of floodlight reminiscent of carbon arc lightning, classic red green blue primaries color palette which is a true beauty to behold in several scenes. They used old anamorphic lenses, they color graded the footage as to be reminiscent of the glorious Technicolor age and its 3 strip process. The sets are beautiful. All this requires tremendous work and it really shines throughout the film. The team that was in charge of the technical aspects is top notch first class hands down no question. And here lies the true sadness: what it is and what it could have been.La La Land has many nods to different classic films. It clearly pays respects to Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire. And here lies another big problem. Those guys were Gods with shoes on. Compared to them, R G is a world class grade A dilettante. He's a good actor, whatever, but his dancing skills reminds me of that show Dancing With the Stars at most, which I always zapped away from. The film pays respects and nods at many old classics, while itself achieving nothing except basking in a pool of mediocrity, and worse, it's getting big time rewarded for it. No! That's just wrong. It's a disturbing trend and a symptom of a much greater and complex problem our society suffers from. It's like anti-vaxers for art.The ending is the lowest point for this film. I'm obviously not spoiling it, but it will leave you wanting your money back. For me it was the killing blow. If there's a word to describe this whole experience, it's kitsch. For a comedy, it's barely funny and apart from the technical aspects which are really good, there is very little of movie metamaterial that could hold up under close scrutiny when compared to the great classics, or even other modern musicals for that matter.

La La Land follow this tradition. It's a wonderful film that needed an editor, hence why I gave it a 7 even though I think there is so much to love.The film stars two young dreamers in Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) and Mia Dolan (Emma Stone). Wilder is a struggling musician who is a rarity in the City of Angels: A native Angelino. He drives a older convertible which fits his persona: he was born in the wrong decade. He sneers as he sees his city gentrify and much of the older culture vanish. He dreams of owning a jazz club as he himself looks for any opportunity to make a quick buck, whether that's playing Christmas standards as a lounge player, assisting an 80s cover band at parties, or touring with a pop band that stands for everything he's against. Dolan, on the other hand, is like many in the city: from elsewhere. A native of a small town in Nevada, Dolan drops out of school to become a barista (aka actress) while frequenting auditions that go nowhere. Naive and hopeful, she's the counterbalance to Wilder's cynicism and pessimism. They immediately connect on one particular thing: pursuing their dreams.I think that Gosling and Stone have excellent chemistry. I see some people complaining about that and I have no idea what movie they were watching, as I thought their romance was genuine and real, unlike most we see in film/television. I loved the magic the film had, reminding us of what great cinema can do in taking us to another world. Appearances by J.K. Simmons, John Legend, and others provide great additional support to the film. The music is beautiful and will stay with you for a long, long time, from the high energy opening number, which sets up perfectly for someone coming to L.A. for the first time, to ""City of Stars"" that encapsulates what we think of when we think of Hollywood. Another thing I see people complaining about are the numerous party scenes. As someone who lived in L.A. for a while as a starving artist, I can attest that yes, this film captured them perfectly. Most of them are insufficient and very rarely does anything happen at them that causes anything important. That's why I think the film does a great job at making them seem unimportant: they pretty much are, yet artists in the city go to them with the hopes that maybe it'll be the one that'll change everything.I have one major beef with the film, but it's a big one. The editing was bad. There are scenes that point to future scenes, but sometimes these scenes lead to nothing, which makes me wonder why they were still in the film. Also, I think cutting about 30 minutes off of the film would have made it better. It got long in certain parts and I think you could have made it about 90 minutes and it still would have been an excellent film.La La Land gives me hope, like those of new citizens of L.A., hoping to make it in acting, or directing, or writing, or music, or comedy, etc. Damien Chazelle is a very talented and young filmmaker who has given us now three excellent films. Maybe he can lead a new revolution for film in Hollywood similar to what happened in the 90s when filmmakers like Fincher, Payne, Tarantino, Lee, Singleton, Ritchie gave us really creative and groundbreaking original work. It's desperately needed in superhero/sequel/reboot obsessed Hollywood.I recommend La La Land and call it a 9/10 star movie trapped in a 7 star film that needs an editor and some polish.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Painful to Watch,"La La Land is certainly the most ""hyped"" film of the year. Maybe it's a film for people who don't like musicals, or have never seen a really great musical film. As much as I like both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, neither of them can sing or dance well enough to star in a musical. It's mind boggling to think of all of the talented men and women on Broadway who could have really nailed these roles.The opening musical sequence is embarrassing. And way too long - kept looking down to avoid watching the screen. Also, much of the plot is a rehash of another crummy musical, New York, New York (1977) At least that one had Liza Minnelli to sort of save the day whenever she started singing. The ending, especially, is the same downer. It doesn't work.So catch this on a rental if you're curious, but it was not enjoyable. Will probably win all kinds of Academy Awards, knowing Hollywood - it's that bad.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

"Despite its imperfections and focus on style, La La Land improves with each act and by the end is emotionally captivating","While La La Land would seem to be a combination of things I dislike (romantic focus, musical, more style than substance), I was surprised by how deeply I was invested in the two main characters. Gosling is phenomenal, and Stone puts on a performance for the ages. The script is tight and showcases many sides of their characters. I'm not one for musicals, but I will admit that the music from the movie was excellent. La La Land definitely left me shrugging at times - I didn't like the opening sequence or the first act in general, as the development of how their relationship came to be was unrealistic and inevitable. The lack of real, developed supporting characters also hurt the movie - neither of them really had anyone else relevant in their lives, or by chance no other intriguing characters become relevant in the plot? Several times I was taken out of the story because of a song and dance number that to me didn't add anything to the movie and just prevented more interactions from happening. Despite these problems, La La Land truly improves as the movie progresses, and by the third act I was enthralled. The ending was heartbreaking and brilliant, as I'm coming to expect from Chazelle. Showing the events unfold from Gosling's point of view really made the ending hit home, and while it's sad, it feels satisfying and right. For all its flaws, I loved Gosling and Stone's characters, and Chazelle again directs a great movie and excellent third act.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Hollywood Narcism,"I went all in to to film despite the Oscar buzz, not because of them. Director Damien Chazelle had wowed me with his story of a jazz drummer student striving for greatness in ""Whiplash"". It was both parts brutal and honest in its' projection of musicians in training. ""La La Lan"" is completely a fictional Hollywood tale made for the movies. Different movie but same love of Jazz character unable to commit to a girl. So, here we let the excursion begin.... into a TV commercial on a parking lot (that we only discover is L.A. at the end of the scene)..... Context missing and I was lost...The genre demands instant suspense of disbelief once the music starts and that opening scene was as memorable as all of the other afternoon traffic jams we experience, albeit with folks certainly outside the ages range of 24 - 32 year old dancers preening for their 15 seconds of screen time. Ad agencies sell washing machines, yogurt, oranges and dish washers this way.No matter what the stars, the plots, the choreography, the MUSIC has to be the star in a musical! Every top musical has numbers you leave the theater with some new love of song. I say the song, you say the movie, :""Maria"", ""Consider Yourself"", ""Cell Block Tango"", ""Aquarius"" off the top of my head. And these are not the classics that were being paid homage to.That out of the way, I really fell for the Emma Stone character. I didn't need for ""Mia"" to be singing ""American Idol"" style, which you'd expect in a Hollywood Musical. Her face alone gave way to multiple emotion, like her audition called for. Emma was wonderful to watch. Ryan Goslings' ""Sebastian"" is a bit stiff and his ""Bogart"" doesn't inspire a lot of emotional suspension of disbelief required to enjoy the lark of the adventure. The Hollywood Actress wannabe story line maybe cliché, but we like this story and even have come to expect the predictability of it. It is The American Dream and somewhat universal... just s=needs memorable tunes and for the male counterpart to figure out and buy into his character arc a bit more. I couldn't buy into his ""jazz isn't dead/I have a dream/ I'm supporting my girl"" miss mash.So my experience wasn't all that I was hoping for, but much like Los Angeles itself, there's something to visit, but I wouldn't want to invest too much of my entertainment time there.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

A fine tale of Shattered and Achieved Dreams but shows us how much do we owe and miss Classic Musicals of Old Hollywood.,"La La Land (2016) :
Brief Review -A fine tale of Shattered and Achieved Dreams but shows us how much do we owe and miss Classic Musicals of Old Hollywood. In the first intentional meeting of hero-heroine in La La Land the heroine gives a reference of Iconic film Casablanca (1942) and the very next moment i knew in my mind somewhere that this film is going to have a similar climax like Casablanca where the Hero will have no girl in his life and has to leave Heroine who have another guy in her life. As expected it had the exact same thing but just the theme wasn't so iconic or timeless like Casablanca and the impact of course wasn't upto Casablanca (i believe no film will ever match Casablanca level). La La Land has positives to admire but it also has some issues to deal with. The biggest problem of the film is, it is known as a Musical but doesn't have enough Musicals to be called a Musical. Second biggest fault is both the leading artists Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are below average singers and dancers hence all the Musical scenes look lukewarm. It proves again that how much do we owe to Classic Musicals from Old Hollywood by Gene Kelly. If you remember Singin' In the Rain, An American In Paris then certainly you are not among those audience who call this Mediocre La La Land a Great Musical. I am out of the list. La La Land fails as a musical and it was acceptable because of the modern techniques of filmmaking but it also failed to keep the narrative well versed. I don't understand why that 5-6 minutes dramatic dreamy segment in the climax when the decision was made mutually by hero-heroine both. If it was mutual then of course there was no need to stretch thier shattered dreams through average visual portion. It wasn't the first time when we see Hero-heroine not ending up together because of their careers then why the hell make it look so international and effortless? It was a simple idea and definitely acceptable and impactful too but just because of stretched and mild storytelling it has to lose points from its overall impact. And talking about the opposite side of it, the hero and heroine both confess that they will love each other forever then why there was not a single scene which shows the seriousness of their relationship? Despite regular 2 hours runtime i had to see the runtime bar several times that shows how much the film dragged whereas i remember watching 3 hours long musicals without checking the runtime bar once. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling both give honest performance and thier dedication in the scenes can be seen with their efforts. Screenplay has many haults for no reason and so editing had to be more tight but both the things couldn't collaborate nicely to make it a solid team effort. Director Damien Chazelle has made a good film overall but not subtle and detailed. He missed many nuances and made many small small blur mistakes which technically pulls La La Land much down to make it stand much lower than Old Musicals made almost 5-6 decades ago. Overall, La La Land is a fine tale of dreams and it works on both the sides of coin shattered and achived but as a cinematic musical experience the final impact stays on ""Decent"" Level which is far lower than what some people have made it look i mean ""Great"". Somebody here in IMDB users reviews said, ""Shame on Hollywood for endorsing this mediocre film as Great Musical"", i agree slightly and anyways i don't care much about Oscars.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
Huge disappointment!,"Can not understand how someone who is not a 6 year old can find this movie interesting. A waste of time and money for any adult, male or female. All people I spoke to were very disappointed. Poor story, poor execution. Acting was OK. Dancing was OK. But this is the 21st century, Hollywood can do better. much better. this may have been considered a good movie 30-50 years ago. not today. Not even 1 element in the movie that is new, that brings to life a new point of view, that hasn't been treated before, in a better manner, in so many movies. Nothing that makes you wonder or dream. I am trying to think of a good word regarding the movie... maybe the acting, which was OK. that's it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

The Magic of La La Land: Emotion and Originality in Every Note,"I was never really close to musical films, as I always felt they were forced and didn't add much to the movie. However, La La Land did it in a natural way. While watching, you feel that music surrounds this film from all directions, and the soundtrack is truly impeccable.We need to talk about the chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Their level of acting is outstanding; they managed to convey emotions in a unique way. You genuinely feel that they are in love with each other.Something I really liked was the avoidance of clichés. The script is unique and very original; it's not your typical romance movie where everyone knows what's going to happen in the end.

This movie has a special place in my heart,"This is my 2nd favourite hollywood film. Loved all of Damien Chazelle's films I gave him a lifetime pass and will watch all his future films(thats a lot of them coming)I am a Bollywood fan so have seen a tonne of musicals.And movies with great music are always my favourites. I still listen to the soundtracks 'City of Stars', 'Mia and Seb'. I am frequently playing the tunes in my head. Seb's piano is hands down my favourite, ever so that I started learning piano online and ended when I could play the first part of 'Mia & Seb'The long-take dance had masterful choreography and we can see a lot of hard work went into the film.
The Purple Sky LA is one the greatest cinematography I have seen, each image could be printed out and seen as ART.
The acting of Ryan and Emma was first-class, speacialy Emma in the audition scene. The chemistry is one the best, there is music scene where Ryan messes something up but they both laugh it off and still continue ❤Romance films with tragedy/break ups are always my favourites as they stick with me for longer time. This movie is more speacial because of the 'What if' sequence. That scene is the most relatable thing I have ever seen in my life.
I recommend this movie to a person and I still have 'What if' scenarioes of my own with her.This is one of those movies I promise myself to see every year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
"I liked the film better when when it was called ""(500) Days of Summer.""","This review has SPOILERS!!!! This will be a short review of ""La La Land.""To be blunt, ""La La Land"" is basically ""(500) Days of Summer"" (which came out in 2009) with more song and dance numbers. I read one review about ""La La Land"" along with hearing all the buzz about how great of a film it is. So, I saw a late showing of it on New Year's Eve. I was the first in the theater, and I thought that I would be the only one, but about ten random people walked in. I thought that the retro intro of the film such as the ""CinemaScope"" graphic was cool. But as the film started, I felt like, ""Why does this movie seem so familiar?"" Then it hit me, ""(500) Days of Summer!"" I then was able to predict what was going to happen in the film.Here are SOME of the similarities of both films:Both films have the theme of boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl.Both films have the change in seasons.""La La Land"" has Angels Flight,"" and ""(500) Days of Summer has Angels Knoll.""In ""(500) Days of Summer"" Tom and Summer see an older film. In ""La La Land"" the same thing happens.""(500) Days of Summer"" has Expectations vs Reality and ""La La Land"" has a dream sequence scene at Sebastian's jazz club Seb's where the characters imagine what their lives would have been like if they had stayed together.But, ""(500) Days of Summer"" wasn't the only film that ""La La Land"" will remind you of. As I watched some of the other scenes I kept thinking why does that look so familiar? The film is basically an homage to musicals such as ""Singin' in the Rain,"" and an ""American in Paris."" The scene that is so obvious is towards the end with the boy and the giant red balloon, which was a blatant homage to ""The Red Balloon,"" which teachers at my elementary school seemed to have enjoyed screening for us. I read a review after watching the film and it had still comparisons of dance numbers from the plethora of films it pays homage to including ""Sleeping Beauty."" One of the homages to ""(500) Days of Summer"" is when Sebastian and Mia are riding Angel's Flight in downtown Los Angeles. Although Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel) didn't actually go on Angels Flight, they sat on one of the benches next door at Angels Knoll.How many homages can a current film have in it from films decades old along with a super similar story line to a more current film from 2009 before it stops being an homage, and starts being something else like a best of compilation piece?Do I think that ""La La Land"" is a GOOD film? Yes. Do I think that it is a great film? NO! Do I think that it is an overrated film? Yes! Do I think that it will receive countless awards and nominations? Yes! Hollywood loves films with song and dance numbers, especially if the actors aren't known for those talents. This would have been a much better film if Joseph Gordon-Levitt had portrayed the character of Sebastian instead of Ryan Gosling. Gordon-Levitt can show more emotions on screen than one look Gosling, and has a better singing voice, along with dancing talent.""(500) Days of Summer"" was original, and felt more real because of the characters and the non-cliché happy ending, and the real places in LA that the average person could visit that aren't normally scene in films that are made in LA. ""La La Land"" is definitely a fun date film, and likable, but when you realize as I did that this is a lesser version of ""(500) Days of Summer"" with more song and dance numbers, (along with a boatload of homages) it doesn't seem as creative as the current Hollywood buzz/hype portrays it to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Not as Bad as Some Reviewers Think,"I'm not generally one to criticize others' opinions or reviews, I definitely believe we're all entitled to our own opinions, but I honestly can't fathom how a number of reviewers are giving La La Land a ""1"" rating. Do they honestly believe this is worse than Leonard Part 6? Or (in the musical category) My Fair Zombie? OK, so it's not Singing In The Rain, or West Side Story. Or Chicago, or 42nd Street. That certainly doesn't mean it warrants a ""1"" rating. And to be fair, I don't believe the movie warrants the ""10"" ratings it received either.One of the complaints I read was the ""jazz"" in the movie was not of the level Sebastian (Gosling's character) pontificates about. OK, so they couldn't get Miles Davis or Dizzy Gillespie (of course not, they've been dead for years), but what I heard was good enough (from my non-expert perspective) to set the stage for the movie.Personally, I enjoyed La La Land, and will most likely see it again. I found the characters engaging and the music entertaining. Is the score on par with Chicago? No, but that doesn't mean it's terrible. I especially enjoyed the opening number, recognizing it was done all in a single take, and marveling at the coordination that must have taken. I've never been a huge Emma Stone fan, but I liked her in this, more than I expected to. Ryan Gosling's character is a bit of a jerk at times, but not so much as to be a detriment to the story.Overall, I thought it was a pretty solid addition to the musical category.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"
This is a poor man's Woody Allen movie!,"I've read 8 great reviews on this film. I went and saw the movie last night, and I'm usually a very positive person, but was very disappointed. The highly ranked reviews must be from Sunshine Pumpers who are desperate for a comeback of a 1940's musical, or don't have a clue about a great musical:(""Chicago"", ""West Side Story"", ""Moulin Rouge"", ""Grease"", ""Singing in the Rain"", ""Cabaret"", ""Oklahoma"", ""King and I"" etc. etc. etc.) None of the songs were catchy or memorable. The good: Emma Stone did some very good acting. Also the sets were creative, and colorful. Miscast: Ryan Gosling, he can't sing. (think of a 25 year old stoic Kevin Costner) He would have been better type cast in a sports, western, buddy movie, mystery, gangster, or in a drama. Most likely cast as eye candy for the 18 to 24 year old gals. The opening scene is a hot, sweaty LA traffic jam on the freeway, where 50 or more people jump out of their cars, and start dancing and singing. It's a long non-stop shot that is VERY difficult to film. (think of Orson Welles: ""Touch of Evil"") but we have all been there, no fun, brought back bad memories of heavy traffic jams, and I just couldn't see the fun in a traffic jam. It's like I wouldn't want to see a song and dance scene of a ER room or of Anne Frank. No memorable classic lines: ('Show Me the Money"", ""You'll Shoot Your Eye Out Kid"", ""There's No Crying in Baseball"". Folks, this film will be forgotten in a year.

Sing Your Emotions,"Seemingly frivolous details can destroy one's most cherished dreams. Feelings of excitement and disappointment are reflected in the music and lyrics. In ""La la land"" the lyrics are enjoyable and life-affirming. The film teaches people to sing their emotions. For the average person to express her/his feelings of love is quite difficult. But, for example, if someone tried to form into a song his/her feelings of anger, hate, sadness, that might possibly help in saving the beloved and prevent tragic consequences. And finally, song is a beautiful way to share emotions among people.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Music"

Some of the dancing scenes were downright silly and the songs unrealistic, thereby giving a feeling of falsehood. The main premise was believable but depicted poorly.
