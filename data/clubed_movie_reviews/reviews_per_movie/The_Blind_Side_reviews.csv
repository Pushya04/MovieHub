Better than I thought,"I've been reading lot of horrible comments that are based solely on the issues surrounding the movie rather than the movie itself. I wasn't excited to see this movie, I'm not interested in sports at all. The movie kept my attention though and well. It moved along quickly and pulled me into the story and left me feeling inspired. I wasn't excited to see a blonde sandy bullock in a sports movie, I think that's what might have turned me off the most, but she did really good job! It's rare to see a movie where there's a really strong lead female character. Whether you like Leigh Anne Touhy or not in the end, she is certainly entertaining and Sandra Bullock does a great job of bringing her onto the screen. The youngest son did an amazing job! So much talent in him. The character of Mike I think could have used a few more lines, even if he's supposed to be shy and reserved. All the actors really did a great job though for the most part. No it's not an epic Oscar winning film, although I wouldn't be surprised if Bullock got nominated for something for her acting. It is NOT loaded with propaganda as the other reviews might suggest. It's a light entertaining pick me up film that would be an excellent choice to bring the family to, most likely the reason why they released it over the Holidays.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Skillful, compassionate and dignified  portrayal of an amazing, true personal drama","I have just returned from seeing the blind side. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie, particularly it's more poignant moments. Yes, this is a sports story, yes this is a biopic, but it is also in large part an interpersonal drama. It is rare to see a movie these days that relies on drama to carry it-not special effects, lush historically accurate wardrobe, or astounding make up- just a story that resonates with the viewer. That this story is based on contemporary facts makes it all the more resonant. Events that might have been handled superficially, predictably or exploited for dramatic purposes were instead presented in a nuanced and profound manner. Michael's biological mother was portrayed with dignity and compassion. In short, the aspects of Michael's story that make it moving and inspiring were captured with skill and integrity. As for the negative feedback regarding this movie that began when the only the trailers were available - I think the comments might be more a reflection of the world view of the authors rather than a reflection of the quality of the movie or the reality of Michael's story. Some people think the movie ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was a story about racism in the south, or that ""The Crying Game"" was a movie about the IRA - to me those were the settings for the drama, and not the drama itself. John Lee Hancock really bit off a lot when he took on this project-but as it turned out, it was not more than he could chew. Remember when Attorney General Eric Holder commented on how we were a nation of cowards when it came to openly discussing race? With this movie, Hancock has demonstrated he is not one of those cowards. He did not ignore the racial or class differences of the characters in this movie, and he avoided using the movie to make a social statement with the movie. He allowed these character attributes to be what they were in reality, and told the human drama in an effective and sensitive manner.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very well done!,"I don't usually feel the need to leave comments, but this movie was just to well done not to. I went in expecting more football, more hits & highlights & as a huge football fan that was one of the main draws of the movie. The football actually takes a back seat to a wonderful story that is well executed by everyone involved. I've always thought Sandra Bulluck has been over-rated, but she nails this role & deserves some recognition down the road. The movie is so fantastic that anyone and everyone can relate and feel connected to the characters. The ideal target audience for this movie is children and adults alike. This movie should be an Oscar contender but I know these types of movies rarely ever win. Definitely deserves my vote!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Fantastic, heartwarming, fun and emotional.","I just saw The Blind Side last night. As I have read even if you are not a football fan you'll like this movie. I am not a football fan (baseball is my sport) but I loved it!!! So many great performances by the actors. A charming story with laughs and tears. How nice to have a positive movie this time of the year especially. Everybody MUST see this movie. Quinton Aaron does a fantastic job of playing Michael Oher. In the early scenes he has no dialog, but expresses so much just with is eyes and facial expressions. Jae Head is charming as the young ""brother"" S.J. Camped up I am sure, but I go to the movies to entertained which the movie does in spades! Sandra Bullock as I have never seen her before, does a wonderful job, so different that the other roles she has had in the past. And Ray McKinnon as the coach has some expressions that John Lee Hancock should be awarded for his direction.",,Anonymous,Biography
Sandra Bullock as Saint Sandra Bullock In A Terrific TV Movie,"I must confess I was weeping 5 minutes into the movie and that's unusual for me. I had read the book and in the book nothing is that black or that white for that matter, but this is as movie and as a movie it works. I was expecting commercial interruptions every few minutes, the film felt so much like a TV movie. But that is not necessarily a bad thing. The Michael Oher story had to be told even with the poetic licenses that the film takes, shamelessly. Sandra Bullock plays herself beautifully as always and her character with all her saintly stern, southern modern American woman could not move away too far from ""Miss Congeniality"". But it works and at the end of the day, after paying the prices one pays at the box office, it's almost enough. Why they had to ruin it with an Oscar nomination? The nomination makes you look for something in her performance that clearly isn't there. If you go to a Sandra Bullock movie, the quality of the movie may vary but she is always terrific, playing that Sandra Bullock character. Good for her.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Review of Blind Side,"The movie Blind Side is a non-fiction story about the life of Michael Oher and his struggles to overcome life's obstacles such as social problems, the struggle for human dignity, human relationships and coming of age. The plot of the film is that a teenager Michael Oher (played by Qinton Aaron) has been surviving on the streets with little closing and no place to live. He is spotted by Leigh Anne Touhy (played by Sandra Bullock) and as she questions her children she learns that Michael, commonly called Big Mike by other kids, is a classmate of her kids at Wingate School a school predominately for those with social status. On that first meeting she insists that Michael, who is scantily dressed for the winter, get into the car and takes him home for the night. Once there she is a little scared that he will do something, but in the morning finds all the covers neatly folded on the end of the couch and Michael gone. This first moment of kindness on Leigh Anne's part, and the unfamiliar behavior expected by Michael, to later draw the family to make Michael a member of the Touhy family.Although there are extreme differences in background, Michael accepts to live with the Touhy's an in turn undergoes a entirely new set of challenges. Some of those challenges include, fitting into the school, trying to pass classes to be able to play football, and making friends. SJ Touhy (played by Jae Head) becomes Michael's closest friend and helps him to overcome many of the social obstacles. At one point Sean Touhy (played by Tim McGray) mentions that Michael is ""basically a fly in a bowl of milk at Wingate"". As the story goes on Michael eventually begins to change the lives of the Touhy's as they make discoveries into their own lives and how they have grown accustom to having money and overlooked those who don't. An example of this is when Michael questions what happens to all the uneaten food at the restaurants the Touhy's own. Leigh Anne even stands up to her lifelong friends as they question her intention with having Michael around all the time and admits that Michael is changing her life.This film gives you the sense of caring and makes one take a look at their own life and how one might overcome adversity to become something much greater in life. The background in which you come from does not make the person. It is how the person treats the world that makes a difference. Yes Michael becomes a football player (high school, college & later NFL), but at one point they had to ask him if he even wanted to play football. It's a great real life success story, but one has to look past the achievements of Michael Oher at the real meaning of what the Touhy family did. It a movie about the best in humanity and how, if those who are blessed with financial and spiritual resources reach out and share those blessings, they can change the course of someone's life for the good.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another inspirational sport film,"I saw this last night at a screening and found it to be a very inspiring movie. I love sports movies as well as movies based on true stories, so this film hit multiple buttons for me personally, but reactions of others leaving the theater seemed equally positive.As with any sports movie, you must have an underdog to cheer for, and Michael Oher is that underdog. Having been removed by CPS from his crack-addicted mother's home as a child and bounced from foster home to foster home, Oher has been staying on a friend's couch. He is reluctantly accepted to a private school when the football coach sees potential in him and pressures the school's admissions board to give him a chance.Unfortunately, being an undereducated black youth in a predominantly white private school doesn't magically turn his life around, and in addition to struggling to understand his classes, he finds himself sleeping in an all night laundromat after the stay at the friend's house ends. While walking on a cold, rainy night , Oher is offered a ride and then a place to sleep for the night by the Leigh Anne Tuohy, whose children attend the same school Michael does. It's this single act of kindness that begins a chain of events that will change this underdog's life, eventually resulting in his being a top 2009 NFL draft pick and signing with the Baltimore Ravens.The actors brought plenty of life to the characters they were playing. It was a pleasure to watch Tim McGraw as Sean Tuohy, making a somewhat minor character in the film memorable. Sandra Bullock's portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy was fascinating--I'd really love to meet Mrs. Tuohy in person. Jae Head as SJ became my favorite character in the movie, practically stealing the show as it were. Quinton Aaron's portrayal of Oher leans heavily to the strong, silent type, but there is a quiet grace and gentleness that comes through.Obviously, nothing is quite as slick and clean as Hollywood plays it in movies like this, and there were issues and controversies surrounding the Tuohy family and the assistance they offered Michael Oher. Some of it is depicted in the movie, though not all, and there are many who will decry this film for that. It's a given that there is more to a story than what you see on the screen...condensing years into a two hour presentation requires some compromise...and it is meant to be entertainment after all.I only had a couple criticisms. One, at 126 minutes, the movie was a little too long. I think 8-10 minutes of editing would have really tightened it up and eliminated a couple slower moments. Second, Sandra Bullock's accent seemed a little too forced at times. And finally, what happened to Steve Hamilton, the boy whose family Michael was staying with when he started attending Briarwood? Once introduced as his father pressures the coach for scholarships for Steve and Michael, he disappears from the movie. Minor issues that didn't keep this from being an extremely enjoyable movie, but did help keep it from being a perfect 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Humorous, heartwarming, and satisfying","In the fact-based film The Blind Side, a burly homeless black teenager Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) is taken in by the family of Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), a spunky white Christian mother of two and assisted through school until he achieves success as a football player in high school and college, eventually being drafted in the first round by the professional Baltimore Ravens. The film, written and directed by John Lee Hancock and adapted from a book by Michael Lewis, is undemanding entertainment that lacks a great deal of subtlety but is continuously entertaining and emotionally involving and redefines the true meaning of family values.Michael who is known initially as ""Big Mike"" has been abandoned by his drug-addicted mother and survives in the slums of Memphis, Tennessee only by his wits. He sleeps where he can find a warm place -- a friend's couch, a Laundromat, a school gym -- when a family friend intervenes and helps him enroll in a private Christian high school. Sensing the boys' potential, football coach Cotton (Ray McKinnon) convinces the administrators of the school to admit him although he knows that he will not be eligible to play football unless he can keep up his grades. Seeing Michael alone wandering the streets, he is given a lift and taken home and made a member of the family by Leigh Anne, an interior designer who lives with her husband Sean (Tim McGraw), teenage daughter Collins (Lily Collins), and SJ (Jae Head) an expressive little boy who provides most of the film's comic moments.Living with the Tuohy family allows Michael to learn to trust and to begin to express some of his feelings from a life of poverty and neglect. Michael who is so big that Leigh Anne can hardly find any clothes to buy for him is also gentle and lacks the killer instinct required of a football tackle. Tutored by the adorable SJ and counseled by Leigh Anne to view the team as a family he has to protect, Michael begins to develop his aggressiveness as a left tackle and develops his skills, eventually turning the team into winners. To raise his grades to be eligible for a college scholarship, the Tuohys hire Miss Sue, remarkably performed by Kathy Bates, who admits to the Republican family that she is a Democrat, prompting Sean to remark that he ""never thought they would have a black son before they met a Democrat."" Besides his grades, however, Michael must overcome several more obstacles that stand in his way before he can enter college.The Blind Side shows Michael Oher achieving a transformation in his life based on his relationship with the family who took him and nurtured him to independence and self-respect. Sandra Bullock delivers an emotionally resonant performance as a woman whose life is enriched by her simple act of kindness and courage to act from her values. While the film breaks no new ground stylistically, it also resists genre clichés, has no movie villains, avoids cheap sentiment, and, in spite of patronizing images in its trailers and advertising posters, is a humorous, heartwarming, and satisfying experience. Ultimately, The Blind Side is not a film about sports but about the rewards of showing love and support when it is not always accepted or understood by the community.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
I can see why Michael Oher was unhappy with this film,"First of all, Quinton did a fine job in the lead role. Let's get that out of the way. Great acting job. He took the material he was given and played the role very well.However, this film is pure Hollywood sap, a ""feel good"" movie that picks and chooses factual elements and builds a fictional tale around them. The film loves the character of Leigh Ann (who is really not that interesting, although she is kind hearted and generous), and as a result, Oher is relegated to a shy over-sized charity case with no clue and no skills of any sort, other than his natural kindness and resilient character. That strengthens the focus on Leigh Ann's rescue actions, how she ""saved"" this poor aimless kid and gave him all the life skills he needed to succeed on and off the football field. It resonates with white suburban do-gooder audiences, but it's just not accurate.In truth, Michael Oher was already a very good football player when the Tuohy family took him in. And he had a bold, confident personality that rubbed off on everyone and made him a natural leader. He was a motivated, focused kid who knew what he wanted, but came from an environment where no one really cared or provided support. He was NOT a shy, introverted pathetic case. He just came from a terrible domestic environment and found stability with a nice rich family. The real story of Michael Oher is how he caught the luckiest of breaks and escaped the ghetto jungle and was able to leave all that soul crushing crap behind, and focus on academics and athletics in a completely different upper middle class environment. It's a study in how important environment is in the life of kids and teenagers, and how it can make a huge difference.But what we, the audience, receive is a Hallmark channel film that is nothing more than a lazy, formulaic, fictionalized ""warm your heart"" chick flick couched in a football world. Sassy dialogue, woman-takes-charge scenes, tender moments, etc -- all the usual stuff is there. The film would have been FAR better had it focused on Oher as the lead character, instead of Bullock. No offense to Bullock, who is a fine actor.It is well known that real life Michael Oher was very displeased with this film, and how it portrayed him.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bullock's Masterpiece,"I don't think I've seen a Bullock movie since ""Speed"" that didn't leave me watching my cell phone for the time. Her movies have been pretty awful and worth skipping. Not this one. The story received a lot of press and one has to give her much credit for snapping up the rights to it. She also did a fabulous job as the heroine. I was simply amazed. It was really one of the most amazing career rehabilitations since Travolta in ""Pulp Fiction"".I loved the story. It is a genuinely heartwarming tale of an abandoned teenager adopted by a wealthy family and guided to success. And it's all true. This is what make me love movies. What a great film!

One of my top 5 movies of '09.,"This movie was amazing and it gives you so much. Sandra bullock's performance was great, I would actually go so far as saying it was her best ever. I really think she might get an Oscar for it this year. The real Leigh Anne was born just so that Sandra Bullock could play her in this movie. She was dead on throughout the whole movie. If you haven't seen it you have to. I usually get really bored watching true life stories but this one kept me interested thru out the whole movie. If there was such a thing as a perfect movie, this would be it. Great plot, Amazing actors, Talented directors, etc. Go and see it. And I really think both men and women will like this one. It has a very sensitive touch but still it has a lot of funny moments and it has football in it. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The Blind Side's motivational, yet no character study.","The inspirational story of Michael Oher, the performance from Sandra Bullock, and the good camera work, so why did it not come together? I think the blame is on the screenplay. The overall portrayal of Michael Oher seems stylized in a way that never really shows the true grit or sentiment of the character. It is all so glamored up. Yet the messages of the movie still stay true and the performances are finely tuned, especially Bullock's. The racism displayed is reflective and correct. Ther are lots of things the filmmakers got right, but there are plenty they got wrong as well. The results are a serviceable portrait of a very honest and fortunate man that never adds up the way it should have.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sandra Bullock,"Just watched this after reading a news article in the entertainment section of an online newspaper and thought I'd look it up.Went onto YouTube because the newspaper's video clip wouldn't work, YouTube didn't let me down and I was able to watch a clip.I have to admit that although I have enjoyed all the films that Sandra Bullock has made and have a bit of a soft spot for her, which means that I will watch anything that she is in, I've always thought of her as a bit of an acting lightweight, always seeming to be in those slightly off, quirky type of acting roles in the films she's appeared in.In The Blind Side she's had me change my view of her as an actress, as in this film we get to see her really act seriously, making the role her own and showing that she can really act.Her character is so believable and I so hope true to life of the real person that she was playing in the film - and to me showed a different side to her acting talent that really up until now I haven't really seen before.This film is worth watching for the story and all the great acting in the film from all concerned.If you have a couple of hours to spare this film is well worth the time to watch and enjoy and end up feeling warm and cosy by the end :)",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Starts off okay but ends as complete formula movie,"The fact that this is based on real events made it inevitable that there was a movie. Unfortunately, after an interesting beginning they fell lock, stock, and barrel into a completely predictable Hollywood formula. The directing is heavy handed and pretty bad - nothing subtle about anything in this film. The acting is even worse. We won't name names but you know who I am talking about. Character development is terrible and people are only one-dimensional caricatures. I also felt that the movie only used worn out, negative stereotypes of white Southerners (racists) and blacks (gang bangers, militant NAACP people). Why this movie is even mentioned in the same sentence as the word ""Oscar"" I will never know.If you want a good football movie with good acting, try _Rudy_. If you want a better talented-black-kid-gets-into-lily-white-prep-school movie with much better acting, try _Finding Forrester_. This one is not worth your time.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A blind man can tell that this is a great film.,"Nice to see Sandra Bullock come back after the cinematic travesty, called All About Steve(2009). This was a well made film, perfectly filmed,and great performances by everybody.Leigh Ann Tuohy(Sandra Bullock), seems to have the life most women would envy, a wonderful supporting husband(Tim Mcgraw), and two great kids(Lily Collins and Jae Head). But one day while driving home, she sees, a larger then life teenager which everybody calls Big Mike(Quinton Aaron), when she tries to talk to him, he comes across as a little withdrawn, and is nearly homeless, she decides to take him in, with her supporting family behind her. Leigh finds out his name is Michael Oher, and tries to dig up things about his past, in hopes of helping him, but the question is will she?I really liked this film, it manages to balance humor and drama perfectly. Sandra Bullock gave quite a strong performance, so Quinton Aaron, Lyn Collin, but Jae Head is quite the scene stealer. It also has a good football scene as well. And Kathy Bates is good in her supporting role also. I say see The Blind Side.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

I always knew something felt off about this movie...,"This is definitely a great ""feel good movie"" with a great cast and great acting, and if it were based on a fictional character, I'd have no qualms with it whatsoever. However, this movie is not based on a fictional character, it's based on a real man who was lied to for all of his adult life by individuals who profited from him thinking they were ""family"". Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy (portrayed wonderfully in the film by Tim McGraw and Sandra Bullock, respectively) tricked Michael Oher into signing a conservatorship - granting them financial control over his earnings and allowing them to use his likeness for this film and their numerous books - when he thought he was signing adoption papers making him part of the family. The saddest part that makes this one of the worst white savior scams ever is that they and their two biological children were paid $250,000 + 2.5% of net profits EACH from the $300,000,000+ grossing film (about $4.6M each), while Michael himself received nothing for the movie about HIS life, and Oher had to find this out himself after hiring a lawyer to get to the bottom of this. There is no way I could ever watch this movie again and enjoy it any bit knowing that the main character got swindled by people who claimed to love him only to profit from his success story.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"An Encouraging, Compelling, Drama","The Blind Side was an enjoyable movie. Although, the movie was based on a true story it was delivered in a very appealing manner. The movie cast really brought the movie to life. Sandra Bullock played the role of Leigh Ann Tuoly, Quinton Aaron played the role of Michael Oher also known as Big Mike and Jay Head played the role of Sean Jr. Tuoly also known as S.J. The cast made me forget I was watching a film that was based on a true story. It was as if the storyline was playing out for the very first time. Big Mike was a high-school age teen, who played football. He lives in poverty, going home to home, school to school, without much family support or stability. Big Mike, is ultimately befriended by S.J. who is much younger than he and they develop of friendship. The interactions of Big Mike and S.J. caught the attention of S.J's mom, Leigh Ann Tuoly; Big Mike, did not go unnoticed from Leigh Ann from that point on.The complexity of Human relationships and Coming of Age were two of the most prevalent themes throughout the movie. Most people that came in contact with Big Mike, were intimidated by him because of his size. No one took the time to get to know him or understand his plight; until Leigh Ann did. Even when Leigh Ann, decided she wanted to take Big Mike in, her family and people around her weren't very supportive initially. People simply did not understand and most people are afraid of what they don't know. Big Mike dealt with the complexity of human relationships in several facets. Once Leigh Ann, took him in, he went from living in poverty to living very comfortably. It wasn't until he began living with Leigh Ann, did he have a bed of his own for the very first time; which was a big difference from how he was accustomed to living. Big Mike was also as a large black man, now living in a community that was primarily white. He had to adapt to the stares, glares and some people just not liking him.Another film that comes to mind with a similar theme is Precious, only it's more intensified. While the main character Precious played by Gabourey Sidibe, also dealt with the complexity of human relationships; the complexity was with someone really close to her; her mother. The person we seek love from the most, naturally. Fortunately for Precious, she encountered someone at school who saw past her flaws; her teacher; Ms. Rain played by Paula Patton. Ms. Rain, seen something good in Precious, just as Leigh Ann, seen in Big Mike.The techniques in ""The Blind Side"" seemed to be the coolest at night, on the football field. The view of the stadium lights gave for such a great illusion, gearing our attention to the football field and the football players. There were many other people and objects in those scenes but we were drawn to the football field. I also really appreciated the slow motion effects, it made you anticipate what was going to happen next. It really pulled you into the scene, you felt as if you were there.The movie was definitely one that dealt with the complexity of Human Relationships and it was interesting to see some of the complexities overcome the throughout the movie. By the end of the movie Big Mike did not deal with as many complexities, nor conflicts, which made for a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bend It Like Bullock,"The movie business is weird. A girl who mainly had minor roles in B-movies 30 years ago can suddenly become one of the world's highest-paid actresses.

Positive review of the Blind Side,"The Blind Side Movie ReviewThe story of Michael Oher and his adoptive family led to one of the greatest movies of the decade, and one of the best I have ever seen. Between the phenomenal true story, the emotion, and the amazing cast, it was almost impossible to not fall in love with this movie.Michael is a poor black boy from the hood, while the Touhy's are a rich white family from the suburbs of Memphis. The Touhy family is driving home one night and see Michael walking around with nowhere to go. They generously give up their home for the night but little do they know they will instantly fall in love with this boy and take him in as one of their own kids. Throughout the movie the Touhy's give Michael a home, and education, and a love for football. Michael's life is changed instantly for the better. All because one family forgot about race and took in a boy in need.The story line is the most important part in any movie, and in ""The Blind Side"", the story is everything. The fact that this is a true story is what really makes it special for me. The director John Lee Hancock did an outstanding job of recreating Michael Oher's life and making such an emotional movie out of it. Seeing Michael's transition academically and athletically all because the Touhy family gave him a home is truly inspirational.To go with the great story, John Lee Hancock needed an excellent cast to help sell the story, and he got that with award winning actress in Sandra Bullock. Sandra Bullock is arguably the heart and soul of this movie. She plays her role with such a passion that it is hard to believe that she isn't actually the mother of Michael Oher. This is one of the key reasons the story is so believable. Sandra Bullock did an amazing job being a mother in this movie and showing true compassion for Michael's Character. The whole supporting cast was great, and showed a true family bond, but Sandra Bullock is really the main factor in the movie that makes the love so believable.This movie is very diverse in emotion. From the first moment Mrs. Touhy meets Michael we can feel the love and compassion she has for him. But at the same time the opposing football players have so much hate for Michael just because of the color of his skin. The fact that the Touhy's were the only ones who accepted Michael is very inspiring. They never thought twice about what they were doing, they just did what they hoped anybody else would do. It is nearly impossible to not be moved by this movie and its emotion. The way Mrs. Touhy treated Michael like one of her own kids made me fall in love with the story the first time I watched it.""The Blind Side"" is a great movie that is perfect for those of all ages. John Lee Hancock did an amazing job turning this true story into a masterpiece. This is not only a heartwarming story about a family who took in a child in need, it is a story about a family that changed a man's life.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Lot of hype, little delivery","This film had some potential, but instead plays it safe to become another rags-to-riches cliché.From the beginning, it is obvious the team went for a ""family friendly"" film, which certainly holds back its realism. The story is well written and flows nicely, but nothing seems original here. Combined with Bullock's gag worthy cliché lines, it just seems too much.Bullock's acting is done well, but nothing close to a stellar performance. Quinton Aaron does little, if anything, to further convince the audience of his horrendous life beyond occasional sad glances and moping around. The rest of the characters, including Tim McGraw's, are decent additions to the story.Overall, ""The Blind Side"" seemed like a mass produced, over hyped, rags-to-riches story in a genre that has been overdone (especially recently). If you're looking for a good movie to pass the time on a bored Saturday night, I suggest you pick up the film. But if you're looking for a stellar story with plenty to love, don't even bother.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

History Teacher,"I haven't seen the movie yet... going today! But just a fun fact... actress Melody Weintraub who plays the history teacher was an actual teacher at Briarcrest when Mike was there. She actually taught art though! And as for the comments about Bullock over-dramatizing Leigh Anne, she didn't! That is how Leigh Anne really is! She is a very outspoken and determined woman. Just FYI. Also, I know some people have been commenting on Quinton Aaron being to quiet and unemotional... but that fits Mike to a T. He is the sweetest guy... always makes a point to say hi to you, etc... But he was very shy and quiet at first. He has gotten to be a little more open and sociable throughout the whole ""transition"" process.

Movie Based On A Lie,"I feel it needs to be heard that this entire movie is based on a lie. As it is now known, the Tuohys never adopted Michael Oher. They instead tricked him into thinking he was signing adoption papers, and instead had him sign conservatorship papers, as Oher found out in February 2023. The Tuohys profited 300m dollars off this film and Michael Oher had not received a single dime from it. Not only this, Michael Oher was never dumb, he knew the game of football and was a current player when the Tuohys took him in.While the performances of the actors may have been great, it is hard to justify supporting this movie any longer. Hopefully Michael Oher can get the justice he deserves.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"This movie was great, and heart warming","The movie looked like it was going to be boring the first five minutes but did a 360 after a few minutes. It was heart warming, loving, full of action and funny. It is one of the best movie I have seen the whole year.Tim Mcgraw was great in it and Sandra Bullock was excellent although I never liked her acting.Dhe was great in it. The other actors were great too and funny. It had football, and Tim Mcgraw so thats why I choose to see it but turned out to be so more better than I thought. I choose this movie over twight and I am glad I did. It was truly a great movie to take the kids or dates too. It is a great movie for girls and guys because it has mix of girly and guy moments. I truly am surprised how good it really was. What a great decision seeing this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Truly Inspirational Film,"If I had a theme, I would just say truly compassionate. Let me start out by saying I am a very masculine male who is big into sports, spent the first have of my childhood growing up in the projects, I can relate to Michael's(Quinton Aaron) upbringing. Though not to his extent. With that being said, this movie brought a tear (one tear) to my eyes seeing the compassion that Leigh (Sandra Bullock) and her husband Sean (TimMcGraw) showed this young man who had been abandoned my his drug addicted mother. The way Mike bonded with Leigh's children, S.J (Jae Head) and Collins (Lily Collins) was great. Although Mike was a big kid, he was very gentle. Remember the scene where he told Leigh that he did not like being called Big Mike. Also, the movie had religion in it as the school accepted Michael based on their religion principles. Also, the way Sandra reached out to find Michael mother was very impressive. This movie had it all, compassion,drama, sports and religion. It made me appreciate the good in people and I truly want to pass this on. Maybe if more people felt this way, the world would be better.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
love this movie highly recommend,"Sandra Bullock is rapid and compelling in this true story of tragedy-turned-triumph. The Blind Side is an enjoyable that some may consider a bit too soft or safe.

"Sassy, Sassy, Sassy","The only thing separating ""The Blind Side"" from a made-for-TV movie on the Hallmark channel is the fact that Sandra Bullock is probably too expensive for Hallmark.I know this film is based on the true story about an affluent white family who take in a homeless black youth and raise him as their own. But even though its origins are grounded in fact, the film felt like a congratulatory fantasy conjured out of white guilt. The film is so anxious to be family-friendly and palatable to the least sophisticated film goer that it almost avoids dramatic conflict altogether. Conflicts are there, but most of them are resolved within the next scene or two, never building to any kind of suspense or emotional payoff.Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for the same reason Julia Roberts did -- Hollywood loves to recognize appealing actresses for being sharp and sassy. But Roberts had much better material to work with in ""Erin Brockovich."" The material in ""The Blind Side"" is usually just shy of gag-inducing, and at one point -- when Bullock's character confronts a group of gang-bangers with a ""you go girl"" attitude and actually succeeds in intimidating them -- downright ludicrous. At the very least, she would have been laughed at in that situation, and quite possibly would have been lucky to escape without physical harm.The film also stars Kathy Bates as a sassy tutor, and uses the character of Bullock's younger son for...you guessed it...sassy and damn near intolerable ""comic"" relief.The success of ""The Blind Side"" with middle America is clearly attributed to its religious and wholesome message and values. Fair enough. But it's precisely simplistic and dumbed down movies like ""The Blind Side"" that make me leery of anything geared toward the Christian community.However, I will say that it's refreshing for once for a film to have actually been seen by the audience who needs to hear its message. And it's also nice, in the wake of ""The Passion of the Christ"" and other movies embraced by the religious community, to see Christianity associated with productivity and goodness rather than with pain and guilt.Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""Hoop Dreams"" it ain't.","Whatever the real story behind the film story of this movie (i.e., upper middle-class white family taking in and propelling a poor - but physically massive - black youth to football success) I didn't especially care for the film. One should read the book of the Blind Side to get the real story that sparked this movie.As for the movie, itself, it seems to be from the same attitude that brought us ""Ozzie and Harriet"", as well as ""Father Knows Best"", on TV in the 50's and early 60's when white people ruled the earth. This current movie, though, is not about those TV families. It's really about the White, Southern, God of high-school football, and if it takes a hulking, disadvantaged black boy to keep that image of God going, then so be it.For a less romanticized, but more objective, view of disadvantaged black athletes in a white, Christian, school environment you should compare this movie with the classic movie ""Hoop Dreams"" (reviewed in IMDb at: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110057/)I'm very glad to see Sandra Bullock win awards for her performance in this film, but keep in mind the awards are for her, not for this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
True meaning of inspirational,"Now I have seen a lot of reviews about this movie and unfortunately some were bad and while I have seen a lot of true story inspiration movies I gotta say this one just touches you in every way possible it inspires you , you actually feel great after watching it and forget all the sadness and hatred. Sandra bullock put an astounding performance of her life. I recommend this movie to anyone who really understands the science and true meaning of a great movie that was based on a true story like ""Men of honor"" and ""A beautiful mind "". All these movies have touched us deeply and although I was cynical about watching this movie at first I just watched it out of boredom and it was the best decision because you actually can forget about all your problems and be caught in this amazing story . I also gotta give it to the director and production simple and elegant and to the point",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Could Have Been So Much Better,"After hearing all the good things that everyone had to say about ""The Blind Side"" I just had to see it. Honestely, I don't know what all the fuss is about. Besides the fact that Sandra Bullock plays her character very well the rest of the movie just bored me. This movie had so much potential if they would have explored their characters into more depth. Tim Mcgraw is ugly without a hat btw. The best part was when Sandra's character calls the football coach in the middle of the game. She reminded me a lot of my aunt maybe the only reason I found it funny. All in all the movie was okay. Maybe it's just because I don't really like sports. I recommend you see ""Precious"" much better.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great movie,"In this world of calling everyone a racist because they are white, this movies shows the truth and reality of people who have the love of Christ in their heart and do not look at color but see a person who had no hope and they loved him and gave him a home. They saw a life and cared about a life when no one else did. This is not just a story about a great football player but a story about human beings rejecting racism and helping another in need. It is the same as the good Samaritan. I admit this is a tear jerker and there is no action as it relies more on touching your heart than special effects. This movie is worth watching over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Okay...,"I think that this movie was pretty good as far as real-life sports stories go. This was an interesting roll for Sandra Bullock who normally goes for the comedic roles and I think that she pulled it off pretty well. The story itself just draws in the viewer and the presentation is funny, emotional, and heartwarming at the same time. One thing that I did not like however, was that the film focused more on the mother (Leigh Anne Tuohy) than the boy she was helping out (Michael Oher). Like every movie that is 'based on a true story' you could also tell that it was largely exaggerated at some points, but overall it was a good movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
You can't win,"'The Blind Side' is a feel-good movie about a rich white Nashville, Tennessee family (the husband is a former athletic star and restaurant magnate, the wife an interior decorator with posh city contacts) that rescues a poor orphaned black boy and nurtures him into becoming a great football player. Based on a book by Michael Lewis, the story is substantially true: Michael Oher is a real person who had a crack addict mom and no dad, went through a series of foster homes, had a miserable young life and lousy school record. When the Twohy family took him up, he had gotten into a fancy school by a fluke when the coach saw his athletic potential and got him admitted. It's not just because of his athletic potential, the coach (Ray McKinnon) argued, in the scene of the movie, but just the good thing to do. 'The Blind Side' talks a lot about the good thing to do. The family and a friendly teacher saw he wasn't dumb, and he gradually improved his initially terrible grades and academic performance so he could play.The real life Michael Oher lived more or less this experience, got good grades after being tutored, went to the University of Mississippi. The NCAA was indeed suspicious, as in the movie, of Michael's choice of Ole Miss, since both his adoptive parents and his tutor were graduates and huge supporters of its football team. That was forgiven and he had a stunning college athletic career paved with trophies and recently got a five-year, $13.8 million contract to play for the Baltimore Ravens.The movie is about the miraculous blooming of a humble ghetto boy who learned to repress bad experiences and instead of being angry, is protective -- so he eventually becomes great at playing defense. As ""Big Mike"" actor Quinton Aaron is so quiet and recessive even S.J. (Jae Head), the pint-sized, hyper-active ""brother"" in his white adoptive family, runs circles around him as a personality. But the dominant figure is Sandra Bullock as the wife, Leigh Anne Tuohy. Bullock gives a suave performance: she's a walking cliché yet manages to be quite winning. Leigh Anne not only initiates the adoption when the family observes ""Big Mike"" walking along the road from the school in the rain on a cold day with nothing but a shirt on. She even steps onto the football field later to coach the coach, telling him how to marshal the youth's formidable defensive skills.Critics are much less pleased by this film than Hancock's previous sports drama, 'The Rookie', another true story from a book, that one about a baseball player, who overcomes initial disappointment to become a pro. Dennis Quaid plays the athlete in 'The Rookie,' and the focus is on him and on the game.The idea of a saintly white woman who saves a po' black boy sticks in the craw of many, whether it's true or not. Melissa Anderson of the 'Village Voice,' who was added to the New York Film Festival jury that chose Lee Daniels' explosive and lurid 'Precious' last year, complained in her review that ""unlike the howling rage of Claireece Precious Jones, Michael. . .is mute, docile, and ever-grateful to the white folks who took him in. . .'Blind Side' the movie peddles the most insidious kind of racism, one in which whiteys are virtuous saviors, coming to the rescue of African-Americans who become superfluous in narratives that are supposed to be about them."" It's hard to deny that 'Precious' the movie certainly focuses in much more detail on Clareece's grim, abusive ghetto existence. It plunges us into that world and rubs our noses in it. Though deeply flawed, 'Precious' is vivid. 'The Blind Side' tells its story conventionally, taking few chances. But 'Precious' is deeply flawed. It's melodramatic and lurid and omits any glimpse of positive aspects of Harlem life. But it's more memorable than 'The Blind Side'.I'd like to know how the real Michael Oher feels about this movie -- and about his own story, for that matter. If his experiences turned him into a much celebrated pro footballer, how is their story ""the most insidious kind of racism""? If the Touhy family made his success possible with their support, love, and money, are they not indeed ""virtuous saviors""? What is the politically correct way of telling this story?The advantage of 'The Blind Side' over 'Precious' despite its risking charges of white condescension is that it provides a positive image of helping the disadvantaged in the face of peer disapproval. 'The Blind Side' is about racism: the Tuohys face it from rednecks on the football field and from Leigh Anne's well-heeled lady friends, who chide her for including a giant black youth in the family's Christmas card photo. Or course this is nothing like the danger Michael faces when he returns to his mamma's neighborhood. A prominent black movie critic, Armond White, hates 'Precious.' He calls it ""the con job of the year,"" and says Daniels, Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey, the powerful black media magnates, ""come together at some intersection of race exploitation and opportunism."" 'Precious' is exploitive. The ""crime"" of 'The Blind Side' is that it shows white people helping a black person. However, Leigh Anne tells her bitchy luncheon pals that she's not helping Michael, he's helping her. But that too will be be debunked: the white lady is doing good so she'll feel good. The Touhys had a wonderful time helping Michael Oher become an athletic star: shame on them! In this kind of subject, you just can't do the right thing. The (predominantly white) audience likes 'The Blind Side' just fine. It plays in three times as many theaters as 'Precious' and has made five times as much money.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the Best Sports Movies I've Ever Seen!,"This was one of the best movies I have ever seen! The actors playing the characters were phenomenal and the script written was very well done. This move had tons of humor - which I did not expect at all - and quite a few heartwarming moments that almost make you cry. I can easily see why the actress playing Leigh-Anne won so many awards. She has one of the best southern accents I've ever heard.

A helping hand,"The Blind Side is a most inspiring film about Michael Oher a gentle giant of a kid who's not gotten too many breaks in life. But all he needed was a helping hand and he gets one from country singer Tim McGraw and Sandra Bullock and now Michael Oher is one of the top defensive players of the National Football League.Quinton Aaron plays Oher and for most of the film he's pretty mute, almost catatonic answering in monosyllables. He's brought out of the Memphis ghetto by a man who would like to get him just off his couch. Aaron's mother is a crackhead and she's long abandoned him.McGraw is a football coach at a private Christian High School and Bullock is his wife. The story here is how Bullock proves to be the mother figure this young man needs badly in his life. He becomes a member of the family as much as her two natural children with McGraw are. As for Tim McGraw he shows some acting chops and holds his own with Bullock and the rest of the cast.Aaron is a catatonic gentle giant, big enough for defense on any team, but lacking in aggression. Best scene in the film is when Bullock teaches him the necessary aggression needed for that sport.Rivaling that is a voice over narration of a composition that Aaron writes interpreting The Charge Of The Light Brigade. Aaron in the voice over proves to be quite articulate and definitely not stupid as was thought by many. I'd give the paper an A.The Blind Side is a wonderful family film for which Sandra Bullock copped a Best Actress Oscar. The Blind Side was also in the running for Best Picture of 2009. Quite deservedly so.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Uplifting But Often Cliché Story,"Based on true events, The Blind Side chronicles the story of Michael Oher, a homeless boy who, as a result of the kindness of a caring woman and her family, becomes an all American football player. Sandra Bullock delivers a performance that's miles away from her typical portrayals (Miss Congeniality, etc.) and with it has positioned herself as an Oscar favorite. The movie, however uplifting and celebratory it is, seems to miss the mark in a few places. It has come to light that Michael Oher is not as dumb as the film makes him out to be. It appears that the filmmakers took some liberty here in order to make the transformation of Oher look more astounding. Also, much of the writing is classic ""feel-good movie"" writing. There are certain lines and plot points that you just know are going to come back around in the story, making it somewhat predictable. I would have liked to see the filmmakers not resort to such cliché dialogue. The movie is entertaining despite it being fairly slow in the beginning. It's not among the year's best but it's worth seeing for those who enjoy a heartwarming story.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Better than expected...,"This film was nominated for the best picture Oscar in 2010, it didn't win, but Sandra Bullock did pick up the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role. Given all this recognition I decided I'd better see what all the fuss was about. I have to say that, as a Brit, I and don't really follow any American sports which it made it a little hard to follow in places, but I expected that. I've seen the Super Bowl on TV and have seen films such as 'Any Given Sunday' which have given me a bit of an insight into the game and the attention it gets over there. Having said that, the film isn't all about American Football, it's more about relationships and how helping out a fellow human being can bring something good. Oh, and it's based on a true story. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please block that guy trying to sneak around the sideline while I write the next paragraph).Michael 'Big Mike' Oher has had it rough all his life, his mother is a crack addict, his father has disappeared, but he has one thing in his favour, he's big really big. More by luck than design, he gets enrolled into a predominantly white Christian school. His teachers don't really hold out much hope for him since he seems disinterested in classes, but one teacher, Mrs. Boswell, discovers he is maybe not as dumb as they first thought. He is befriended by young S.J. Tuohy, the son of Leigh Ann and Sean Tuohy. Recognising that Michael has nobody to look after him, Leigh Ann decides to take him in. Eventually his grades improve and he is allowed to play sports. He is, not surprisingly chosen for the Football team. After a stuttering start, and a bit of coaching from Leigh Ann and S.J., he finally gets the hang of the game and from here, as they say, the rest is history. I'll leave my summary here so as not to infringe those NFL Spoiler Police.This is a very heart-warming film that will appeal to the North American audience more than most of the rest of the world. I found it to be very well made with a few good performances. As far as that goes, I thought Sandra Bullock was good as Leigh Ann Tuohy, but Oscar worthy? I'll let you decide. Tim McGraw did a fair job as Sean Tuohy and I thought Quinton Aaron played the understated Michael Oher very well. Jae Head reminded me a little of a young Macaulay Culkin as S.J. Tuohy and Lily Collins was OK as Collins Tuohy (the daughter). Honourable mentions go to Ray McKinnon as Coach Burt Cotton, Kim Dickens as Mrs. Boswell and there was a nice cameo from Kathy Bates as Miss Sue.So we have a very rich family taking in a young black boy who happens to be an athlete. The cynical among us would instantly put this back on the shelf and leave it there, but I found it surprisingly better than I first thought it would be. Mainly due to the understated performance of Quinton Aaron, his performance really made the story work (for me). Contrast that with the outgoing and boisterous S.J. and it's a combination that really works. The scenes where this pair is on screen really stand out. Over all, I found it a little too long and a little too schmaltzy for my taste, but worth one viewing Recommended, for the one viewing only then you can move on.My Score: 6.4/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing Film,"This movie was amazing. Leigh Ann was everything a mother should be and more. She took in Michael as her own and showed him unconditional love. The lighting of the film depicted the events happening in the film. In scenes such as when Leigh Ann was visiting Michaels mother, their was low-key lighting but when Michael received the news that he was becoming a Tuohy, their was a lot of high key lighting. This movie gave us what we needed to make the connections at the right time. John Lee Hancock didn't give us so much that we were overwhelmed after the film. I give this film a five stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Inspiring and inspired twice: Bullock, and Bullock's character. It's her movie.","The Blind Side (2009)I managed to see this in the theater, and I think this always helps a movie through its so-so aspects. But it also magnified the really spot-on characterization of a tough, big-hearted, fast thinking southern cliché of a woman (a white woman in this case, Leigh Anne Tuohy) by Sandra Bullock. She has a compelling if not amazing support cast, appropriately maybe, for this is a kind of finely tuned television scenario, made to Hollywood standards (in the best sense). But I say this because it's true enough to help understand the feel of the film: mainstream, feelgood, well-paced, well-written. Beyond Bullock, the two boys stand out, the big Quinton Aaron and the diminutive Jae Head. And some actual football coaches show up for cameos. It's all pretty fun and at times funny and even at times tearjerky. Not bad for an everyday so-so movie.The plot is the other lynchpin holding the movie up, but also holding it back. All the personal bravery (however clichéd it looks on the screen), and the crossing of class and race lines, make for good American fodder. I bought into it for two hours. In the long run, it shines light on two pillars of mainstream American society: sports and Christianity, and both glare a little in the light. A little. The big money that drives college sports (and taints it, we presume) and the hypocrisy of ordinary folk who espouse some Christian values and not others (an old theme) are given an honest but very shallow look.There are scenes that are stretched thin, like the depictions of the projects and poor African-Americans bad mouthing Leigh Anne. But there are other scenes to balance this off that might be just as thin, but which are funny, as when Leigh Anne tells off some of her so-called friends at a restaurant. Low key, acerbic, and justified. Most of all, over and over, however improbable, Leigh Anne Tuohy ""does the right thing."" A curious (and probably painful) counterbalance to Spike Lee's idea of right.The vibe in the movie review world is that this is a core values, conservative, even (slightly) evangelical film (at least compared to some of the competition). And that's unfair to conservatives, who can't be painted or tarred too easily, and to liberals, who have big hearts of their own now and then. That is: Leigh Anne is a paradigm of someone who is both supremely comfortable, her husband dripping in new wealth, and sharply moral. Her position is not simple. She not just someone who just does good (pulling a black homeless high schooler out of the street and into her white home). She does so with subtle, cunning, unflagging compassion. Yes, she is in a position to do that more easily than most, but she does do it. She is a role model.And there are those out there who don't like to see role models come from the other side of the aisle, and so a left-leaning saint is a bleeding heart liberal and a conservative saint is a do-gooder. Shame on everyone. See this movie and flinch at its clichés if you want, but settle in to see one performance, by Bullock, that hits just the right notes. She was surprised at how well it has been received, so you may as well be, too.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
TIW white savior film,"So today I watch The Blindside and it was bad.Let's start with the positives, Sandra Bullock was OK. She did pretty good, and I actually think this might be the best performance that I have seen from her and(though I haven't seen speed). I still have criticisms with her performance, but I could tell that she was actually trying in this film and I think it did show in the final product. I still definitely don't think this was Oscar worthy, but it was good. 6/10 :)If I'm being brutally realistic, that's really the only thing positive about the film. Everything else is rather average or bad. The film almost comes off as a Hallmark movie with its overly-sappy manipulative constantly playing unimaginative soundtrack, over abundance of editing that makes it feel almost like an action film, cheesy and terrible writing, and at best average acting from the rest of the cast.The music is really really REALLY annoying holy moly, it's completely bland, simultaneously annoying and forgettable, and formulaic. It sounds like it's straight out of an off brand sims soundtrack or ANY HALLMARK MOVIE . It's also just constantly playing in every scene and is trying it's absolute hardest to manipulate your emotions. It is very very annoying and has 0 restraint.The story structure for this film is very slow and several scenes linger for an unnecessary amount of time for no reason, there's a scene when Sandra bullock and a character are talking and the scene dragged on for SOOO long and then I realized I could speed up the movie and it's still so long even when sped up like there's so much empty space between when people speak it's very unnatural. There are scenes that have literally no impact on the movie at all that almost feel like they're from a separate script. Like seriously there was a scene with 2 main characters that seemed really crucial and then it was literally resolved the next scene and then they brought it up one time in the scene right after and it was never brought up again and had literally 0 effect on the story.The acting is all very average, kids did slightly above Disney channel acting but had terrible writing that made me feel like I was listening to the actor read the script to me. There's very little standouts in the crowd and everyone did rather average. It's very difficult to distinguish if it's terrible awful writing or bad performances for some characters. The 3 women Sandra bullock goes to food or whatever she was doing with all sucked and they had some really bad incredibly tone deaf one note dialogue. One of the lines in this film ""who would have thought we'd have a black son before meeting a democrat"" so yeahSandra bullock did mostly good but there were a few times when she would overact some of her lines and it was really distracting, but she did good for most of the film. Also she could not cry to save her life till she went off screen. Seriously she sat there blinking over and over and not crying then she goes to the car where the camera obviously does another take and then she's crying. It was kinda embarrassingIn general, this film on so many levels is just viscerally offensive and tone deaf with its portrayal of African Americans and feels like a total white savior film. Like the only black person in the film who likes Sandra bullock and the white peoples is the main character and I guess one other person who says Sandra bullock is nice(who also does drugs btw), but every black character in this movie is just shown as a thug or a gangster who are predatory towards white people??? The main character is portrayed as significantly unintelligent but very strong African American in the beginning of the film and with the help a white rich super multitasking housewife becomes smart enough to play football yay. It's literally the Uncle Tom stereotype and the film fails to be self aware at all in any way towards this. There is many instances when the films implies that it is trying to tackle a big issue and it just seems comedic given all the garbage that is riddled within it. Like you'll have characters saying things like hes black he can't pass a quiz or how something was implied to another character near the end of the movie which was really forced.The editing is garbage and does like a trillion cuts in certain scenes that makes it really difficult to soak in any of the scenes. The cinematography was also below average and I didn't really get anything visually appealing. It wasn't that bad, but it sure was underwhelming and dull.Also there is a lot of cliches that I've seen a billion times. Wow this guys getting bullied I'm gonna leave my popular table to go sit with him. We're gonna have a fight right now cause the movie says so and then immediately resolve it literally 2 scenes later. Theres a few more but you can look those upThis film sucks. 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fairy tale,"If you are cynic, you might wanna steer clear of this. On the other hand, I like to be cynic here and there, and I still did quite enjoy this movie. It's not the best movie ever (far from it), but as a feel good movie, with a hint of danger here and there (and actually an upset that is almost ridiculous), it works very good. Performances are more than stellar too.I haven't seen all the movies that came out in 2009 in America to qualify for the best actress award, but I guess the theme of the movie, helped Sandra win this one. Don't get me wrong, she is pretty good in the movie. But it's the overall impact of the whole thing, that made her win (is my guess).While it might also be the TV movie of the week, the naturalistic approach by our main actor does upgrade it quite a bit.

Leigh Anne hires Miss Sue (Kathy Bates) to work as tutor, giving private classes to Michael to improve his grades and be successful in life.""The Blind Side"" is the wonderful heartwarming true story of a lonely homeless teenager that moves to the house of a Caucasion Christian family that follows the principles of their religion helping the others. The screenplay is magnificent and the top-notch performance of Sandra Bullock is helped by the powerful and enlightened character Leigh Anne and the stunning chemistry with Tim McGraw. This uplifting movie is highly recommended to make the viewer believe that still there are good people in this wild world and a great family entertainment. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Um Sonho Possível"" (""A Possible Dream"")",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
standard-issue crowd-pleaser with compelling performances,"It would be easy to be cynical about ""The Blind Side"" - to point out how it's just another tale of a do-gooding rich white person condescending to help out a struggling minority; that it once again shows a minority at the mercy of the generous white folk; and that it is filled with heart-tugging but implausible Kumbaya moments designed to make us feel good about ourselves and our own nobility. Yes, it would be easy to do that, but the fact that it is based on a true story - that of Michael Oher who went on to play in the NFL - goes a long way towards nipping at least some of that cynicism in the bud.Based on the book ""The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game"" by Michael Lewis, ""The Blind Side"" is what ""Precious"" might have been had it been designed with a mass-audience in mind - a lump-in-the-throat, feel-good crowd-pleaser about a generally inarticulate, plus-size black youngster who's falling through the cracks big time due to poverty and wretched parenting. Only, in Michael's case, he's ""rescued"" by the Tuohy family - primarily the feisty, socialite mom, Leigh Anne - who not only provides him with a beautiful home and a loving environment but lessons on how to be a world-class football player as well. A behemoth of a kid who's as shy and reticent off the field as he is aggressive and domineering on - at least once Leigh Anne has given him a good talking to - Michael doesn't seem nearly as scarred by his upbringing or as embittered towards humanity as one might expect given all he's been through as a child (he's certainly miles ahead of Precious in the coping department).True story or not, none of this comes across as all that convincing, and there are times when ""The Blind Side"" threatens to drown itself and us in a sea of sanctimony and almost constant sentimental uplift. But it also manages to pull itself back from the precipice, at least periodically, thanks to the performances by Sandra Bullock - pushy and aggressive without being off-putting - and Quinton Aaron, who turns Michael into a sweet, likable kid. And little Jae Head (""Hancock"") steals every scene he's in as Michael's wise-beyond-his-years little ""brother,"" S.J. Writer/director John Lee Hancock doesn't bring a whole lot of ingenuity to the plotting or depth to the characters, but he gets the job done, which, I suppose, is all one can really ask for from a film in this genre.As a drama centered around high school football in the South (in this case, Memphis), ""The Blind Side"" can't hold a candle to the magnificent TV version of ""Friday Night Lights,"" but its inspirational story may get to you anyway - whether you choose to give yourself over to it or not.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
It Makes It Work,"The Blind Side is one of those films that you might not expect to be more than a dull saccharine flick, but it is. Even when you wonder how much of a story it can strain out of the actual events it's based on it continues to suprisingly do so. And while it's the most Disney movie Disney never made, The Blind Side seizes your attention and holds it through the entire movie with sound movie and of course Sandra Bullock's Academy Award winning performance.I might also add that though I can understand Michael Oher's criticism about the movie making him come across like a dunce, The Blind Side has also raised his story to much higher prominence and the movie has only garnered respect and affection for him.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Script written for children,"A huge disappointment, I'd looked forward to seeing The Blind Side due to it being a star vehicle for Sandra Bullock who I adore and the fact she won the Oscar for it. Oh dear! I'll make a point of avoiding any more films by this director. It was simply that it seemed written and acted for children aged about ten, roughly the age of Sandra's little boy in this film. Being English as I am, I had no clue that this was supposed to be a true story till the end credits which made it even more cringeworthy. Even giving this three stars is probably generous but that's based on the fact that I found it mildly entertaining (not realising it was supposed to be a true event) and Sandra Bullock is so gorgeous. The acting, apart from her, is atrocious. The little boy, who apparently was capable of completing adult quality business deals, was quite amusing in the part up to the point I finally realised he was supposed to be real. I watched Mike Myers' Cat in the Hat only yesterday and this was about on a par with it. Enough said.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Now this you can call a movie!,"I watched the movie last night. It was a roller-coaster of emotions for me, from feel-good to heartbreak to triumph to defeat, and then triumph all over again.This is 24 hours later, and I'm still thinking if there was something wrong with this movie, but I cannot find anything. Powerful story, excellent top-notch acting, believable situations, real life drama at its finest. A movie to treasure and watch again and again as time goes by.I have been reading some of the previous posters' opinions. It does not make me happy to say that I feel many did not get the message it conveyed, but rather, chose to adopt the very same stance the Social Services Dept. rep in the movie took, that of openly doubting the motives from the family of helping the boy, and sullying their reputation by slapping ulterior motives to their ""mission"" of aid. If we all thought like that, none of us would do anything for anyone.I was a recipient of similar aid myself in the past, not once, but several times. Since I have no family, I saw myself in Michael's position, and mentally, I reverted back to those days and the events that transpired then. Let me say I'd be damned if I thought or said such aid came to me with an ulterior motive in mind. Having been there, I understood Mrs. Tuohy's approach. Why would I call this an example of racism, or of a psychopathic lady with an ego problem?I guess it takes all kinds, but you just go ahead and watch the movie with an open mind without pausing on negatives, and in the end, see how it appears to you. If you think this is an example of racism and hidden interests, fine then. But if you view it like I did, you'll be glad you saw it, and after turning events over in your mind, see how it appeals to your finer senses.I wrote this, not because I'm expecting anyone to read it (I don't think anyone will go through over 60 prior posting just to get to mine), but just because I wanted to give it a 10, so well deserved, and I wanted to thank Sandra Bullock and the entire cast for such a wonderful story, the kind that can make you believe in life all over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mind the Bullocks,"When I first saw this trailer in the theater, I teared up. Something about it caught my attention right from the start. I know, I'm a sucker for an underdog movie, but I think I was welling up because I knew Sandra Bullock was going to kick major ass in this movie and I was right. (Oh, and she looked hot as hell too!) Let's not beat around the bush, I loved this movie. I had no idea that it was based on a true story until the end when I saw footage of the real Michael Oher. I don't really like sports movies and I am not a huge football fan, but that's not what this movie is about. This movie is about doing what is right even if it's the harder thing to do.This is the real-life story of Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), her husband Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw) and their unlikely new ""son"" Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron). Leigh Anne is a wealthy southern spit-fire who speaks her mind and knows what she wants. One night when she spots Michael walking in the cold rain without a coat, that's it, from that moment on, Michael's life would never be the same.Michael's father left when he was just a baby and his mother is a drug addict. Even though he is homeless and wanders from couch to couch, his spirit is never broken. He has the body of a giant and the heart of a lamb. He just needs a chance and thanks to Leigh Anne, he gets it.The love that Leigh Anne and her family show Michael is honest and real. I especially found the relationship of the children and Michael to be unique. I kept waiting for the cliché scene where the ""legitimate"" children are jealous of Michael and all of the attention that he's getting. Thankfully, that never happened. I think that speaks volumes to what great parents Leigh Anne and Sean were. Their children learned by their example and did not pass judgment on Michael just because he was poor and from the projects.For me, the major theme in this movie was: What does being a Christian mean? How many good Southern Christians passed by Michael that night when he was walking in the cold? How many people go to church every week and give to the local food banks but would never pull the car over and invite a huge African-American boy into their car and, eventually, into their life? Leigh Anne Tuohy didn't even stop to think that she might be making a mistake until long after she took the young man into her home and tucked him into bed. That's a Christian who talks the talk and walks the walk.Oh, and who knew the movie would be so funny?! Tim McGraw (who was so believable as the husband that I didn't even recognize him) has some of the funniest lines in the movie. His performance is rock solid and he holds his own next to Bullock's fast and feisty Leigh Anne. Jae Head, who plays the Tuohy's son, steals scenes with his quick wit and enthusiasm. He's a perfect match to Michael's quiet, Ferdinand The Bull energy.So, could this finally be Sandra's ticket to the Oscars? I can't be sure of that. But I can be sure that this movie was pretty great, even without Bill Murray in it. (Who knew that was possible).",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Much better than you might expect,"Version I saw: Amazon Prime rental (Bluray)Actors: 8/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 7/10The Blind Side presents as part sports film, part family melodrama, but there is actually more to it than that. Of course, it is about the rise of sports star Michael Oher, but in that story we see a lot of social commentary, and two really fantastic acting performances. Quinton Aaron is great as Oher, but it is Sandra Bullock who rightly got the attention of the Oscars committee for her role as well-to-do teacher and mother Leigh Anne Tuohy, who takes in a vulnerable black boy and then realizes his potential.The American football scenes are actually remarkably sparse, which is good, because I know very little about handegg. There is also a very good voice-over explanation by Bullock at the very beginning, which told me pretty much everything you need to know for the purposes of the story. There is more a bit later, and I have to admit that I wasn't following the subtleties, but I got more than enough to go forward with.The film does rather lead you by the hand emotionally, but I am happy to accept that from a film as long as it is done well. The social commentary, illustrated in the contrast between 'Big Mike's lack of ambition and the Tuohy family's assumption that the best is available to them, is nothing new either, but the point here is empathy, and the film delivers that in spades.The pace is fairly gentle throughout, which I think is director John Lee Hancock's forte. When he tried thrills and action in The Alamo, he came badly unstuck and ended up with an expensive, boring flop. He excels in writing, and slowly developing themes.The subtext is not perfect, certainly. I detected a couple of missteps, or at least sidesteps, but crucially, I could see mitigating circumstances for each decision the screenwriters made. All round, it doesn't put a foot far wrong.If you are a bloke, and doubt you would like a film this soppy, or you are a woman and doubt you would be too interested in a sports film, I suggest you give this movie a try. I think it will surprise you.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
More Human Interest Than Football,"I made the decision to watch this film for two reasons: One, because I am a football fan, and two, because I like film dramas. Though I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommended to anyone, it focuses much more on the ""human drama"" angle and very little on the actual football.For a basic plot summary, ""The Blind Side"" tells the story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), who is adopted by Leigh Anne & Sean Tuohy (Sandra Bullock; Tim McGraw) and given a respite from life in ""the projects"". A giant of a boy, Michael shows an aptitude for football, learning, and family values under the guidance of the Tuohys, and eventually obtains both a college education and a shot at football's biggest stage--the NFL.Because this is a movie based on a true story, it is tough to know how much of it is actually true. As a sports fan who closely follows the NFL, I know that Mr. Oher himself is uncomfortable talking about the film (or, more specifically, his portrayal in it), so perhaps some liberties were indeed taken to make for a juicier storyline.That being said, this production (for better or worse) is a strong, emotional, human-interest drama that will both warm your heart and make you think. Though the basic concepts and characters are ""vanilla"" enough for even younger children to grasp, the more over-arching themes can easily be picked out by adults and thought upon. The acting also helps accomplish this goal, as the entire cast shines in their respective roles.About the only thing that prevents me from giving this film the full five stars is that I felt it could have devoted a bit more time to the ""football side"" of things (ala the Michael Lewis book). If done correctly, this movie could have been a sort of ""Social Network"", but for the NFL. Instead, to create a more family-friendly film, the production eschews all but a few mentions of actual football.Overall, this is a charming film that is appropriate for anyone. Though not quite ""gritty"" enough to be an outright classic, there is something to be said for its saccharine approach to film- making. View with confidence knowing that you won't be looking at your watch throughout or shaking your head at the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great movie about giving help to those who need it.,"If you love inspirational plot lines, small but important twists, innocent humor and elements of racial prejudice, then this is the film for you. However, if you do not tolerate small amounts of tasteful violence, are a young child, or just don't have much of a heart, then this movie probably isn't your cup of tea. So my opinion of this film is that it's a perfect balance of happy and serious to make for a remarkable re-enactment of a true story.Sandra Bullock shows a whole new side to her acting abilities with her spot on southern accent, and heartwarming punctuality. Behind her at first seemingly hard and cold front, you quickly come to realize, is a sweet Christian lady, who has much more empathy than she would ever let on. This film is made even better with the well known faces of Lily Collins and Tim McGraw as part of the Tuohy family.The inspirational variation of social economic status and racial prejudice adds diversity and relatability to the film. Michael Oher's sad and dangerous past really touches you, and makes LeAnne Tuohy realize that there is a large social gap, and the impacts it can have. Some might say that the film had too much violence, and may have been too intense at parts. But, these scenes were very necessary to feel empathy and emotion towards Michael and others like him, that lived like that.The beautifully placed humor, and Sandra Bullock and Jae Head's personalities, really made the film. It lightened the mood of the seriousness of many situations, and just made you feel good about what was going on. The look into different social economic situations gives you a feeling of gratitude and privilege, that really makes you feel compassion towards Michael.Others might feel that the background and buildup to Michael and his football career is slow, and uneventful. But these events build a story in your mind to how Michael lives. It gives you a strong impression of what his life was like, and why his life is like the way it is now. It's an important part of understanding Michael Oher and his sad story.So I urge you, if you love inspirational stories of football and breaking the social economic status, then you will love this movie. If you like seeing how someone so broken can accomplish so much, then this is for you. Don't waste your time with made up films about aliens, enjoy a very touching and remarkable re-enactment of an edifying true story.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Rebel, Rebel","Greetings again from the darkness. The Sandra Bullock factor kept me away from this for the the first month. I just couldn't bring myself to watch her same old lame act one more time - especially since she has already been in about 12 movies this year. Wow, what a pleasant surprise this was.Based on the amazing story of Michael Oher, Bullock delivers her best work in years, maybe ever. On top of that, Quinton Aaron is terrific as Mr. Oher. The bond is uplifting and believable. Yes, it has some fluff and mass appeal formula, but it is certainly watchable and quite enjoyable.We see very little of Oher's roots and the high school football coach is miscast and tough to watch, but those are the only minor quibbles I have with an otherwise fine movie that will (and already has) appealed to a wide audience. I often worry about my film snobbishness, but I bought off on this one and thanks go to director John Lee Hancock (The Alamo) for teetering, but not falling into full blown chick flick.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Blind Side,"A Touchdown for AllWhether or not you have ever watched a football game, this movie will tug at your heart and have you rooting for Michael Oher right from the start. Through the use of it's dynamic actors, Michael Lewis' The Blind Side shows the importance of family and compassion which grabs the attention of both sports and non sports enthusiasts.The Blind Side tells the true story of Michael Oher's life. At the start of the movie Michael doesn't have a home and is staying at a friend's house in a little part of Tennessee called ""Hurt Village. I'll let the name of the village speak for itself. Both he and his friend are able to begin attending a Christian school on the other side of town with the help of his friend's desperate father. Michael feels out of place right from the start. He is referred to as ""Big Mike"", and is treated as an outcast by not only students but by the teachers as well. It isn't until he runs into Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) that things start turning around for him. Leigh Anne immediately reaches out to Michael and invites him to stay for the night. One night turns into a few more nights and pretty soon Michael has his own room in the Tuohy household. A lot changes during his time starts at the Tuohy's and he goes from being a reserved, ""Big Mike"" to a confident, ""Michael"".The acting in this movie is altogether fantastic. From Tim McGraw who plays Sean Tuohy, to Michael's tutor, Miss Sue played by Kathy Bates, everyone of the actors and actresses deserve a standing ovation. In my opinion, Leigh Anne Tuohy who is played by Sandra Bullock steals the show. The audience can really connect to her empathetic character. Sandra Bullock gives all women a sense of empowerment and shows people that a little compassion can go a long way. Both Sandra Bullock and Quinton Aaron, who plays Michael in the movie help one another to realize how much they need each other. One of the things I love about this movie is that it is not only about how The Tuohy family took Michael in and completely turned his life around, but how Michael became a member of the Tuohy family and gives them all a whole new outlook on life.After seeing this movie, there is one actor who cannot go unnoticed. That would be Jae Head, who plays the role of S.J. Tuohy, Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy's (Tim McGraw) youngest child. Jae has such a big role for such a young child and does it in a way that makes you wonder how someone so young could be so wise. He gives the movie a very lighthearted feel, and keeps people sitting on the edge of their seat wondering ""what will he say next"" whenever he is in a scene. It is clear right away that he and Michael will be close. They hit it off right away when S.J. gives Michael a little advice to ""Smile at them. It will let them know you're their friend"" after he watches Michael scare away two little girls from the swing at the park. It's very heartwarming to see how much Michael listens to what advice S.J. has for him throughout the movie.The Blind Side has something for everyone. This may seem like another cliché sports movie, but it has so much more within it. The fact that it is a true story makes it one that has and will inspire many. The Blind Side is one for all to see and will leave you with a feeling of the utmost compassion towards the people in this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Very Inspirational and warm movie indeed!,"My first impression of watching a Sandra Bullock movie was kinda dicey primarily because of her poor choices over the past few years but this was an eye opener for sure. Startling performance from her as a Tough-on-the- core / Soft-inside mom. Quinton Aaron is the gentle giant. There's a certain charm within ladies for big over-sized guys who have a heat of gold and that is exactly what he has portrayed here. Some excellent scenes where he's shown to be emotionally brittle and vulnerable and his guardian (Sandra Bullock) makes him walk through safe. Being an adopted child, there is that inevitable moment of doubt where he tends to break away but the story culminates in the most appropriate and happy way expected. Nothing too amazing or impulsive to look out for. A very subtle tale of a small bunch of people who loved each other selflessly. :)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Review on the movie itself.,"This movie is a well-crafted and emotionally engaging film that tells an inspiring story of kindness and perseverance. While recent revelations about the true story behind the film may cast a shadow on the narrative, it's important to assess the movie for what it is-a piece of entertainment designed to inspire and uplift.The performances, especially Sandra Bullock's, are strong, and the film effectively pulls at the heartstrings. It's a feel-good movie that, despite some Hollywood embellishments, delivers on its promise to be an uplifting and motivational watch. The controversy surrounding the real-life events doesn't necessarily diminish the quality of the filmmaking itself.For me, *The Blind Side* deserves a solid 7/10. It's a good film that accomplishes what it sets out to do, and while the truth behind it may be complicated, that doesn't warrant a 1-star rating for the film as a work of art.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Inspiring and sweet,"This is a can't-miss family movie. After all, EVERYONE seems to like inspiring family films--especially when it's based on real people. And, not surprisingly, I had a thoroughly good time watching it--though I do recommend you see it with a box of Kleenex nearby.The film is about a young man named Michael Oher--an extremely large black teenager who has bounced from home to home in the foster care system. Currently, he's in a new school and no one realizes that he has no place to live. Yet in spite of having a crack-addicted mother, a father who was killed in prison and every other reason to be an angry powder keg, he's a very gentle and sad soul---who is also enormous and has amazing potential to play football.A nosy but very nice lady (Sandra Bullock) convinces her husband (Tim McGraw) to bring Michael home...at least for the night. But this one night turns into a permanent living situation and he becomes an important part of the family. However, despite this new living arrangement working out well, Michael is so far behind in school and his GPA so low that he hasn't a prayer to play football in college. That's because although many schools are now offering him athletic scholarships, his GPA is too low to allow him to accept these offers. So, with his new family's help, perhaps he can pull up those grades and have a future.This film is super-inspirational and sweet--mostly because it's true. I am sure that some poetic license was taken when making the film (I especially wonder if the little brother could be THIS precocious and adorable), but overall they did a good job of sticking reasonably close the facts. While I loved Sandra Bullock's performance (she's great as usual), I was a bit surprised that she received Oscar for it--I did see a few performances in other films that year that I thought were a bit better (such as the leading young lady in ""Precious""). Also, Tim McGraw, while a lesser role in the film, did a surprisingly good job--especially as he's really known as a country singer, not an actor. All around, a very good film and one that is meant to inspire.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's Okay,"The story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized boy who became an All American football player and first round NFL draft pick with the help of a caring woman (Sandy Bullock) and her family.The highlight of this film is the scene with S.J. serving as Michael's manager. That is pretty humorous, even if it is probably not close to accurate. (Heck, most of the movie is probably not accurate.) I watched this to check it off as a 2010 Oscar winner. Did Bullock deserve the award? Maybe, but all she really does is talk with a bad accent. We also get an interesting story about race, racism, and stark class differences. The message is not blunt, but maybe that is clever in a way... viewers can take away the message they want to take.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A feel good real life fairy tale. That's carried by the tough love performance of Sandra Bullock(her best ever),"""The Blind Side"" is certainly a touching story and what makes it more compelling is it's based on a true story. Even though these miracles only happen in life rarely it did in this case with Michael Oher an orphaned teen who goes on to athletic stardom by getting drafted to the NFL. Yet ""The Blind Side"" is more than a story of a down on his luck kid that rises to fame, it's main showcase is the tough love of Leigh Anne Tuohy(played to perfection by Sandra Bullock her best performance ever)Sandy really steals the show.Based on the true story of Michael Oher(Quinton Aaron)who's orphaned from a young age by having a runaway day and a drug addicted mother. He's grown up in a life of the hood and projects his only hope and escape is that a family member has contacted and wedged a local Memphis, TN high school(Wingate)to see his potential as this kid is big as a mountain he certainly has the size to be a powerful lineman. Oher enrolls yet he's awkward not well educated in the books and still homeless only by happens chance while walking along a road one night he's spotted by a family. This family happens to be the Tuohys a well to do wealthy conservative republican family who rank as the class of Memphis, TN. It's when the backbone of the clan Leigh Anne(Bullock) says right in front of her two children and husband Sean(nice appearance by Tim McGraw)to pull over and take the boy home as her children have noticed him from school.The adaptation is tough at first only to narrowly grow as one by one they get to know Michael and Leigh Anne with her good Christian heart decides that the Tuohys will become his newly legally adopted family. Along the way growing pains are expected but never fear with this families resources Michael is educated and learns a lot as his book skills improve. Still Michael is odd showing no interest in girls yet his one to be discovered talent is playing left tackle on the football team. As his power and god given ability is well showcased in the film. Yet all along his desire to do well comes from his new loving family the Tuohys who give him inspiration mostly Leigh Anne who struts her stuff in memorable scenes by telling Michael on the scrimmage field how to block by giving him words of encouragement. Plus Leigh stands up to her elegant and rich snob female friends at dinner who make fun of her for adopting a black boy.All of this standing tall love and support lead to Michael getting recruited to play college ball at Ole Miss(where the Tuohys went to school). Then after that journey Michael is drafted by The NFL's Baltimore Ravens and he's currently their starting rookie left tackle. Really this film does have a little to much hyperbole and even though it's real and compelling it's a fairy tale story that's slim even though these stories happen they are far and few in between. Still the wild card and film backbone is Sandra Bullock(Sandy is so good with the southern accent) who's near perfect in her portrayal of Mrs. Tuohy who's such a good hearted and nice Christian southern woman. It proves with a strong mother figure who gives tough love, caring, and support a young man can be molded into not only something great but something special and become a grown man. ""The Blind Side"" is hyperbole and a real fairy tale type that showcases a feel good story of a man coming of age by finding out what a loving family brings. And most important It doesn't blind our feelings of tough love as Sandra Bullock's strong and direct southern belle performance proves a mother figure is so important.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A TVM with a Hollywood cast – solid but nothing more than that,"Sandra Bullock's Oscar was perhaps a given but the award gave this film a bump for those who have not already seen it – which is all of us in the UK as the film only came out recently. Watching it though it is hard to shake the feeling that in about 10 years (once the terrestrial premier etc has died down) this will find its rightful home on daytime television surrounded by other overly sentimental ""true-story"" movies. If you take the couple of Hollywood faces out of this film then there is very little else to it that you wouldn't get there.This is not to take away from the basic story which is engaging and quite touching when you go through it, but rather the way it is done. The material is delivered without any insight or depth and what this results in is a rather schmaltzy film that has regular musical cues to let you know how to feel and never really gets to the heart of any of the characters. In doing this it is still an OK film and the actual story is warming and solid enough to do the job – albeit even those who don't know the outcome will have that spoilt for them by the film opening with the assumption that everyone already knows who Michael Oher is. It wonders along with lots of touching moments, sad looks, cute kids and lots of ""overcoming"" but it doesn't manage to lift itself above the clichés in any way other than how professionally made it all is.Bullock doesn't deserve her Oscar for this but who could begrudge her since she is as charming as she is profitable. She does have good moments and she does get the mix of tough exterior and inner emotions but she doesn't do more than that and it is hardly a brilliant performance. Aaron is suitably large and quiet and, from the archive footage at the end, certainly seems to capture the manner of the real person, even if there is always a sense of ""air brushing"" about his performance. Head is irritating as one would expect while McGraw and Collins are so-so. Bates adds another famous face to the mix but nobody really does more than the basics.It is not that The Blind Side is a bad film because I did actually quite like it in an obvious sort of way; it is more that the film itself is sentimental and clichéd without anything in the way of genuine grit or character to get into. The performances are solid and Bullock does her stock no end of good with an engaging ""professional conservative Mom"" turn that has sold well in the areas you would expect, but nobody can do a great deal with this material.",,Anonymous,Biography
Still goint strong!,This movie is one of my go to movies if I'm in a feel good mode. Sandra Bullocks character is probably one of the most likable I've seen in any movie.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good story--great portrayal :),"The Blind Side is by far one of the best stories portrayed in a movie in a while. There is nothing better than a story about overcoming the odds to be all that you can be. This story makes you believe that there are kind people out there who are making a difference in the lives of people who can really use a helping hand. Bravo to these producers, directors, writers, actors and all who made this film. Your efforts are truly appreciated because it is hard to find a really good film out there these days that can serve as an inspiration to others. Sandra Bullock, Tim McGraw and Quinton Aaron are great in this movie. So if you are looking for a good film out there to spend your money on, this is the one for the end of 2009.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Should have been better  ** Possible Spoilers**,"Initially this film was not really on my list to see of the Oscar nominee best pictures. Why? Not a big fan of Sandra Bullock and kind of thought this might be a maudlin, sentimental, schmaltzy Disney kind of flick. Okay it was not overly maudlin or sentimental but the schmaltz came out and a Disney kind of flick it was.So what was wrong. First what was right. Yes the story was uplifting. Never knew about Michael Oher but his story was an inspiration. But so was the film Precious where while Precious wasn't homeless her story was just as uplifting and her background just as difficult. And Quinton Aaron did a good job with the part. May have even got it right.But folks come on. This ain't Father Knows Best or Leave it to Beaver. But it felt like it. We felt like we had been dumped into some 60's sitcom where all the family was just perfect. There was no tension, no grit to this film. Everyone was darned near just nice. Even the daughter who clearly was a bit out of joint acted as if she was just in a nice sitcom where everyone makes nice. And the younger brother - well he just became annoying. The father played by C&W star Tim McGraw - this guy is clearly a lightweight. The love scene between McGraw and Sandra was laughable.Even the tension scenes such as when Sandra had to confront her Republican matron lunch-mates and their racism was like something - well we don't want to make this real serious or anything. Closest otherwise we came to tension was just after Michael left the NCAA lady and confronted with Sandra and during his visit back to the projects and wound up smashing a few heads. Even Kathy Bates was just too nice (I am a Democrat she says). Wow these Republicans live in a Disney world. They really do.Finally Sandra Bullock. Okay Sandra you weren't bad - but Best Actress? The Razzies probably got it right the night before when they gave her a Razzie for ""All about Steve"". What an accomplishment - a Razzie and an Oscar all in the same year. I guess the other nominees couldn't cut it. But I gave high marks to the girl that played Precious but I guess giving it to a 200 pound plus black girl who actually played a gritty role wasn't on the agenda when you could give it to Sandra who I suspect played herself. Tough Republican Mom with a heart of Gold.And Best Picture??? Well I guess they needed a feel good filler. And feel good filler is about all this was. 6 out of 10 which is probably about right.Dchap",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great story addressing many issues at once,"The story is a great one indeed. A rare tale about the love of a family can change a life of one and touch the hearts of many. The story nicely touch on issues as diverse as pure and simple love, racial pretenses and stereotypes, handling adversity, trust, and motherhood. And still, this movie can deliver all those moments with some very funny laugh spots. I like how Sandra Bullock acted out here, just the right level of accent, facial expressions and body gestures to get into her character. We can see her portraying moments of being affected without having to shed any tear. Tim McGraw and Jae Head gives the needed depth in building the story's crucial points. Kathy Bates gives it a nice touch an the short duration she's in. One thing that disturbs me quite a bit is Lily Collins' eyebrows LOL.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
homeless teen becomes All-American and first-round NFL draft pick,"The Blind Side is based on a true story staring Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock) and Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron). Michael ""Big Mike"" is a traumatized boy who becomes an All-American and first-round NFL draft pick player with the help of a caring woman and her family. Leigh Ann sees Michael in the rain one night after her sons school play. He spends the night and ends up staying for Thanksgiving dinner with them the next day. Leigh Ann decides to give Michael a home and the love of a family. She sees that he has a proper education and makes sure he has every opportunity to succeed. When Michael expresses an interest in football, Leigh Ann does everything she can to help him. He doesn't do good in school but can write poems very well. Leigh Ann gets him a tutor to help bring his grads up so he can graduate and attend college. Throughout the movie Michael and Leigh Ann's son S.J. (Jae Head) become very close. S.J. helps Michael train for football and seek fame. He also is his wing man when it comes to meeting college recruiters about playing football in college. Be kind to others and don't judge is the theme to the film The Blind Side. Leigh Anne meets Michael, a homeless boy who she takes under her own wing. Leigh Anne gets a lot of ridicule from her friends but she sticks up for Michael, because he is changing her life for the better. At first she isn't sure if taking Michael in is the right thing but throughout the movie they build an unbreakable relationship that she wouldn't change a thing for. The film shows how important family is and how they can be there for you no matter what. Accepting someone such as Michael into your family is priceless and the film really captures that. There is a scene in the movie where the Tuohy's are taking their family picture for their Christmas card. Leigh Ann tells Michael to get in the picture. He looks very out of place due to his color and clothing but, Michael is family. Leigh Ann's brother calls after receiving the Christmas card and lets her know that there is a colored boy in their photo. He doesn't seem to understand why they have a colored boy in their family photo. Sandra Bullock really does a great job of acting in this film. The film Radio also has a theme of helping others and not judging. It is also a true story of a young underprivileged boy who makes his way into the hearts of the football plays and town. The coach's commitment to helping him is unforgettable. The bond Radio makes with the characters is more important than aptitude, intellect, or athletic ability. Three elements used in the film to help reveal the theme are color, lighting, and angle. The element of color was used a lot, especially in scenes within the household. All over throughout Leigh Ann's house the colors are very natural and inviting. Leigh Ann is a very caring mother and the color scheme presented in the film fits her personality and character perfectly. The lighting in the film is very surreal. The film is shot mostly outside on the football field with natural lighting; however it is also shot in the house with on scene lighting. The different angles the director uses are very important. They convey emotion and set the mood. In one scene in particular all of these elements are used and it's like you were sitting with the family. It's the scene of the Thanksgiving dinner. The family is gathered around Leigh Ann's dining room table. They begin by holding hands and saying prayer. The close up angle of Michaels face represents that he is scared but very thankful to have the Tuohy's in his life. The close up of S.J. nodding his head and looking at his sisters hands lets Michael know that it's OK. The scene is perfect, the room is light by natural lighting thought the windows. The colors and emotion expressed are bright and happy. The different angles bring the setting and mood together, making the movie heart touching and interesting.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Blind Side (2009),"Seeing this after the immense box office and ridiculous Oscar whispers, it's impossible to avoid how overrated it is. This in no way puts the film down. In hard economic times this is the perfect film. It's feel good, has a message about helping people, and has somebody taking on all of life's hardships and coming out on tops. On top of that, Bullock is well cast as a sassy, touch, but still motherly figure. It has bits of humour and plenty of places for emotion. It is aimed at the widest audience possible, which gets in the way of some of the more interesting/ambiguous issues, and there is a sickly ""hooray for white people"" vibe at times, but if it's well made, solid entertainment you are after, you could do a lot worse.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful!!!,"This is a fantastic movie! The performances are spot on; Sandra Bullock does an amazing job of portraying the sincerity of a good southern Christian woman.Very inspirational, a great story of compassion and love.There should be more like this.There are a few situational moments that help to give deeper realistic meaning to this story that disqualify it for children under 13 but I feel it's necessary and meaningful.As a Christian, I would recommend this to other Christian friends.This is based on a true story and someday, if there are enough true stories like this happening, the world will be a better place.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Film is well written, directed and acted, but, doesn't leave you with much more than a ""job well done"" impression at the end.It's not very fun or funny, it doesn't have anything else very remarkable. I'm guessing that was actually the idea, like this being a thing that happened in real life. But, it went too far. We should have, at least, felt the emotions and relations between main characters more.From another point of view, since this is something that happens so rarely in real life (but does happen), that fact is amazing...

"Slightly Overrated by Users, but Still Entertaining","The Blind Side tells the inspirational story of an unfortunate teenager who becomes the ultimate football star. The film, unfortunately, is filled to the brim with scenes resembling those from T.V. movies of the week. The film tries too hard to go for tears over detailing the racial controversies, but the film benefits from strong source material and an inspirational ending. Sandra Bullock, while strong, does not have a single Oscar moment in this film that blew me away. The first half is very well-executed, the second to a lesser extent. I do not think this deserved its Best Picture nomination over (500) Days of Summer, Star Trek, or Crazy Heart, but it is an uplifting tale about the fascinating sport of football. The Blind Side may focus too much on Bullock's character, but as a Thanksgiving/family movie, it is worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

come on America let's demand more from our movies,"So I watched the Blind Side last night, well was it good well no. This  movie is the flip side of this blog. One side is to hopefully find  other movie geeks like myself, and create a forum for introducing good  movies to one another. The other is to discredit those that are  supposedly good but lets face it are not. So why would I watch a movie  I normally would not watch. Well, it was Sandra Bullock's academy award  winning performance of course. I looked over the list of past winners  from 1980 on, and one thing stuck out whether the performances were  memorable or not they all came from good flicks. This thing seriously  felt like a made for TV movie. I think the Michael Oher story is truly  incredible, and the family that adopted him just incredible, when I see  pictures of the very white, very rich, and very southern Leigh Anne  Toughy with this enormous black man from the wrong side of the tracks I  admit it brings a tear to my eye. This movie as of the day I wrote this  review has a 7.7 on IMDb, which on their scale is up there among the  best. Each of these reviews is obviously one mans opinion but come on  people, if we continue down this path of calling movies like this good,  America may someday become no better than one of the f'tard nation of  this world. Come on America we can do better, there is better, please  do not allow Mediocrity to become the new gold standard. Come on  everyone U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A, say it with me and burn this movie and  melt that statue Sandra Bullock won.

Touching and inspiring,"The blind Side is a very touching movie inspired in true story of Michael Oher, a homeless African-American youngster from a broken home, taken in by the Touhys, a well-to-do white family who help him fulfill his potential. As a football player and student, Oher works hard and, with the help of his coaches and adopted family, becomes an All-American offensive left tackle. The story is very interesting, the plot is convincing enough, it is a drama but it has its very good moments of humor. The cast is wonderful and their performances are excellent. Sandra Bullock giving the performance of her life, no wonder why she took the Oscar home, Quinton Aaron in the role of Michael Oher was a really pleasant surprise, Kathy Bates in a short appearance as Oher's professor was quite convincing and Jae Head, the kid that performs as Bullock's son was and excellent comic relief for the movie.

A Life Lesson.,"I cannot describe correctly this movie. Perfect would be a proper word, but i don't believe in perfection. At least until now. After seeing it, I consider myself different. I'll never see the world the same way I did until now. Leigh Anne and his world-size heart inspired me, and this true story made me believe that life it's not only nice in movies. There's people around there that every day make someone's day better. Sandra Bullock's performance in this movie is just outstanding, and I confess myself a little bit disappointed by the non-winning of the Oscar to best picture this year. I only knew the movie was based on a true story when I was in the last part of it. And God only knows how I felt stunned when I realized that. I think everyone should see this great movie, the very best I've seen in my whole life. The performance by the actors is great, the story is awesome, but most of all, it has a philosophy inside. A philosophy we should all listen and practice. We simply should be like that outstanding woman, Leigh Anne. And we should believe everything is possible, like Michael Oher proved us. Because after seeing this, yes, everything is possible. And yes, there's good people that don't let themselves corrupt in this society we're becoming.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An impressive display of the good qualities of human nature,"This film is about a deprived and traumatised black teenager who becomes a phenomenon in the sports world, with the help of a generous and loving family.""The Blind Side"" maybe about uncovering Michael Oher's abilities, and reaching his true potential when given the chance. However, for me the film is more about The Tuohy's amazing generosity and unconditional loving. I am truly impressed by their acceptance of Michael, a complete stranger, without any questions asked. It is an impressive display of the good qualities of human nature. However, the actual film was not as tense, tear jerking or engaging as I thought it might be.

Good movie but not what was expected,"I was curious to watch this well-praised movie ""The Blind Side"" for the role in which Sandra Bullock got her Oscar award. Although her acting was good and this movie is based on a true story I was not impressed by this one. If I had not known that was a real story I would think of this one to be another fake American dream-based movie where a main character had life full of deprivation and abuse, but then a fairy came and changed it to a fabulous one. While watching I recalled another movie I watched several years ago called ""Radio"" with Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ed Harris that was also based on a trues story of a mentally retarded boy who ended up as a support guy to the High School football team. The plots of these two movies are similar to some extent but I liked ""Radio"" more. Watch both and then you can decide which one you like more.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Hollywood-ized version of an inspirational true story,"""The Blind Side"" tells the true story of Michael Oher, a recent first round NFL draft choice whose path to the pros was fraught with adversity. As a homeless teenager he is taken in by a woman and her family who help him to succeed both academically and on the football field.The story as presented in the film is compelling but it also bears the unmistakable imprint of Hollywood at every turn. The feel-good, inspirational plot points often seem too good to be true and, from what I've read, many (unsurprisingly) aren't true. Moreover, the Tuohy family life is portrayed as little short of idyllic and their clan even includes a precocious youngster. More troubling than these manufactured elements, though, is the fact that the script seems to treat Oher as little more than a prop, never giving us much of a glimpse into his personality.As for the acting, Sandra Bullock was rewarded with an Oscar for her performance as Leigh Anne Tuohy, the woman who takes Oher under her wing. As always, she's a likable presence and this is probably her best performance to date. Quinton Aaron plays Michael Oher, giving what I suppose is a decent performance, though it's hard to say since the character is pretty flat. The rest of the cast, which includes Tim McGraw and Kathy Bates, is up to par.On the technical side of things, the film shows polish but not much character. The direction and score are both solid but forgettable.In the end, the appeal of the ""The Blind Side"" is somewhat paradoxical. The film has all the hallmarks of a cookie-cutter Hollywood production yet it hits its targets so accurately that one can't help but get caught up in the story. Thus, the film is hard to dislike, even though it's not without its problems.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

I thought Sandra Bullock was a phenomenal actress, and I was glad she won the Best Actress Academy Award. I really thought that this should have won the Best Picture Oscar rather than ""The Hurt Locker"", and I additionally think that this movie really deserves a higher Metascore because it was really good.

Great Movie,"The Blind Side describes a story about a homeless teenager who is taken in by a family who fulfills Michaels potential and changes their life in the process. The Blind side was about a true story with Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy who was played by Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw who decide to take in a teenage boy Michael Oher who was played by Quinton Aaron. Michael's biological mother was a drug addict and Michael was a ward of the state. Leigh Anne did not know he was a ward of the state until she and Sean decided to adopt and take care of Michael. Michael has had no established education and in order for him to succeed in high school and keep his grades up, Leigh Anne and Sean hire a tutor to help his improve his GPA which in turn will help qualify him for a NCAA Division scholarship. Leigh Anne and her son S.J. Tuohy played by Jae Head, help train and get Michael into playing football. But because of Leigh Anne and Sean's contributions to their favorite college Ole' Miss, there were certain discrepancies brought up Michael wanting to attend that college. A NCAA Lawyer assumes the Touhy's were using Michael for his abilities and Michael felt used. Leigh Anne reassured Michael that they were not using him and they he could go to any college he chose to go to. Michael decided to attend Tennessee College and was the first pick to the Baltimore Ravens in 2000 of the NFL draft. Michael became an All-American offensive left tackle For the Baltimore Ravens with the help of his family and coaches. The motif of this movie has to be Leigh Anne continuing to go to the apartment complex where Michael grew up, whether she was looking for him or they were looking for his mother. The lighting of this movie was natural lighting for the most of the scenes in this film and the use of artificial lights for indoor scenes. The film was a very inspiring movie based on hard work and determination. The film shows people that if you want something on life you have to work hard for it and not every hard working family will pass someone up on the street, they are just as determined to help people out and this movie proves the love for family.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Sugar-Coated, Watered-Down Mess","Blind Side, The (2009)* 1/2 (out of 4)Typical sports drama about a poor black kid (Quinton Aaron) who is living on the streets when a couple rick folks (Sandra Bullock, Tim McGraw) take him into their home. They try to get his grades up at school so that he can play football and soon they discover his true talent. You know going in what to expect from this true-story but the amount of sugar really got under my skin after a while as did the fact that this thing followed every sports cliché in the book. Every once in a while a film will come along and makes millions of dollars and I'm left there scratching my head as to why. I think I know why but this film pretty much plays to a simple crowd who probably aren't going to expect too much. I'm not sure how many times this film followed a cliché and delivered the same type of clichéd line and I honestly couldn't help but laugh. Just like the scene where Bullock walks up to some gangsters in the ghetto and insults them. Now, this gangster just pulled a gun on her son and has probably killed a few folks in his day yet he's going to let this white woman come up on his turf and insult him? It's doubtful but it's one of those ""cheer"" moments that only take place in movies like this. If one hasn't seen a lot of sports movies then perhaps they won't get annoyed with all the stuff here but I've seen quite a few in my day and by the hour mark I was wishing I was somewhere else. The film has been getting a lot of attention for its performances and they're pretty good throughout, although I certainly attach the word Oscar to any of them. Bullock gives the Southern accent her all and delivers a fiery performance but to me the real breakthrough was Aaron. He does a pretty strong job at playing quiet and really delivering emotions without saying a word, which is a lot more impressive than just shouting out lame dialogue. Even McGraw does a nice job but I must say the real NCAA coaches don't come off as good. The subject matter has been sugar-coated to the point of being watered down but this is to be expected since this is a mainstream film trying to capture as many people as it can. It certainly worked because as I was walking out there were many people crying, myself including, but my tears were of frustration for just wasting $20.",,Anonymous,Biography
A feel good film but lacking,"Overall, the acting was good. However, I can see why Michael Oher would be displeased. The film comes across as a white Christian lady and her family saving the day. Everything seems to fall into place, with everyone accepting Michael easily. There is no mention or coverage of the struggles of all parties, that surely they must have felt and experienced. There is only little mention of Michael's skill or the work he put in to get to where he wanted to be. Michael is portrayed as mild and meek, when other sources say he was resiliant and carried himself with humour.

Bullock at her best,"Although the plot is depressing at times, the story is positive and heart-warming. Personally I don't like movies circling around sports too much and I don't even understand Football, so these parts eluded me.

Unfortunately, I was a bit unhappy with the performance of Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher. Oher's character comes across as too sluggish so it is difficult to believe that he pulled off his achievements. The whole Tuohy family also remains a bit undifferentiated except Jae Head who also plays a great role as S.J. Overall, it is a very encouraging movie about courage, (white) privilege (or the lack of it), and how to make a change.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Blind Side,"The film The Blind Side, based on the true story of Leigh Anne played by (Sandra Bullock) and Sean Tuohy played by (Tim McGraw), two people who take in a homeless teenage African-American, Michael Oher, also known as ""Big Mike"" played by ( Quinton Aaron) . Michael has never really had a true family, and does not know the whereabouts of his father and or his mother, whom he has left because she was a drug-attack. Michael has had little education and few skills to help him learn. With help of the Tuohy family, and teachers at the Wingate Christian School, he soon begins to gain the proper knowledge and skills he needs to be able to try out for the school's football team. Leigh Anne soon takes charge, and helps to ensure that the young man has every opportunity to prosper. Leigh Anne starts off by giving the coach a few ideas on how best to use Michael's skills and help him become a football player with such ""protective"" instincts. The Tuohy family, not only gives him a loving home, but hire a tutor, Miss. Sue played by (Kathy Bates) to help him improve his grades to the point where he would qualify for an NCAA Division I, and be eligible for an athletic scholarship. With the help and support of everyone around Michael, he was the first-round pick of the Baltimore Ravens in the 2009 NFL draft. (Hancock, 2009) In the opening scene where Michael is sitting in the back seat of a car with his friend and his friend's father, the viewer sees life though Michael's eyes as he is riding along in Big Tony's car and the viewer gets the idea the kind of life Michael has while driving through the ghetto and into a better neighborhood as they get closer to the school. The camera angles are very observant to the characters view. Another scene that shows good lighting and has specific relevance to the theme, is where Leigh Anne shows Michael his room and he then tells her he has never had a bed before. The lighting is very bright but as Michael scans the new bedroom he is given, it gets lighter as he explains to Leigh Anne he has never had a bed the lighting grows darker as Leigh Anne exits the room and goes to her room to ponder the information Michael had just given her. This gives the viewer the feeling of emotions that have overtook Leigh Anne as she has realized she has just given Michael something he has never had before. One of my favorite scenes in this film is when S.J. played by (Jae Head) and Michael are driving in Michael's new truck and listening to music and they get into the wreck, the director uses a slow motion type affect that shows the truck smashing into the truck and the airbag deploying and Michael stopping it from hitting S.J. The angles used in this scene give the viewer the feeling as if they are in the accident too. This film reminds me of the film Radio with Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. The theme is somewhat close to the theme of The Blind Side. Both characters are taken under the wing of white people who give them the guidance and love they deserve along with a chance to prosper.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Heartwarming, inspiring and memorable","Heartwarming, inspiring, and memorable. The Blind Side directed by John Lee Hancock captures all of these emotions. Based on a true story of love and family, you will learn to protect your blind side.This movie is about the Touhy family and how they took in Michael Oher, an emotionally traumatized high school student who has a talent for playing football. The Touhy's are a wealthy Memphis family that includes Leigh Anne a headstrong designer and mother of two who first took action to Michael when she saw him talking to her son.This moving film had many great features including the contrast of characters and the actors who played them. Sandra Bullock's role as Leigh Anne was breathe taking thanks to her strong personality and not to mention her charming southern accent just for the role. Also, the different characters and background made this movie come to life. I honestly cried each time I saw this even though I knew all the parts. Because of the flashbacks and heart breaking events that took place I couldn't stop watching it. There was also a good balance between the football aspect and the background story to understand what was happening. I really appreciated the recognition this movie brought to people who are well known like Michael Oher. To most he is a just a football player but this movie expressed that even people who are popular or have a talent that is shared, still had a past to get there that may have been difficult.Another reason why I recommend seeing this movie is because its based on a true story. Throughout the show I couldn't help but think that their are people who have had negative events in their life such as these in the movie, but I almost feel like this movie brought a sense of awareness to that. Its also pretty amazing to watch Michael Oher's past and see what he is doing now. The best part about this though is the Touhy family. They created such a positive effect on Michael through their generosity and love. Not to mention Leigh Anne who first decided to help Michael. My absolute favorite part of this movie is when Leigh Anne is at a fancy lunch with her lady friends when they make a few comments about Michael. One lady says ""You're changing that boys life"". And Leigh Anne response is,""No. He's changing mine.""Overall, I completely recommend watching, renting, and even owning this movie because of it's heartfelt message of finding your strength and making your future brighter than your past with the help of kind people.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A more dismal reasoning is behind this film.,"This might seem to be just a movie that aims to be heart warming and make you feel good about life, but there is achingly more behind the victorious conclusion of this movie and little of it is heart warming. Since the days when men were judged to be good or of little use based on their size, there has been an undercurrent of thinking that sees bigger males as better males, i.e. 5-7 is dumb and 6-5 is smart. It probably comes from when there was little medicine in the past and bigger people were considered better breeding material. If modern Universities promote dumb guys as normal guys when they are really not, we are back in the stone age again. It is already happening, and many Universities are nothing more than conduits for athletes to go pro after graduation and academia counts for little. Some Universities will engage in little smear campaigns against students who are not into things like football and who see through this stuff, down to the hard core it is. Hooray for Sandra Bullock, she has a big heart and no clue about Universities, in that are often very bad paces to be in if you have any brains and don't stand eight feet tall and weigh a thousand pounds. I liked that the young black dude in this film got his life together. Great for him. Given that he could barely read, I think its wonderful that several Universities wanted him so badly. I think maybe Sandra Bullock is not aware of what damage promoting large not bright guys as University material has done to Universities. Football doesn't last forever. This policy in effect sends these guys on a collision course with humanity when they stop playing ball. Great stuff. I never met a large guy with much in the way of brains. And I think there is nothing worse than trying to turn back the clock on more brainy students at University by playing games with them as if it was grade three and Tommy can't throw a football right.

Highly overrated!,"The Blind Side is a movie like a thousand others. It's the same movie that you can find on Sunday afternoon on TV, that nobody really has heard of before. Why was it such a blockbuster then?Honestly...? I have no idea!Yeah, the story is true, I know that, but even when the story is true you don't have to make a movie absolutely predictable - that's just bad directing. What's even worse is the screenplay - the dialogues are completely unrealistic, unbelievable and often simply trashy. Some scenes are like copied from B class trashy family movies. That's how bad it gets. As for the acting, the main character Big Mike - Quinton Aron - is just not really good, the scene when he's walking on the street 'being cold' is the best example of that and the sad facial expression gets boring pretty soon, he's still likable when he starts smiling etc. though. As for Sandra - nothing even close to being worthy for an Oscar NOMINATION, - and award is a joke. Not that I don't like her - it's just... just no.Overall, don't get me wrong, the movie is OK-made, it is enjoyable, it's a good movie for the whole family, that teaches values as... family and not only, and has got some pretty good Football scenes, but for those of you that prefer something better in the cinema, it's just not the right choice, sorry.Highly overrated!",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Vidiot Reviews...,"The BlindsideUsually when you pick up a stranger on the roadside, the only thing that you get is your name in the newspaper next to the phrase ""was brutally murdered"". Fortunately, the Southern fried family in this football film got something better than that.After offering a ride home to a homeless African American high school student, Big Mike (Quinton Aaron), Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) and her Caucasian family end up adopting him.Slow to embrace his new surroundings, Big Mike soon learns that life with an affluent, white family has its benefits, including a personal tutor (Kathy Bates) and an opportunity to play University football.While it does have a tendency to sway towards typical white-person-educating-inner-city- youth territory, The Blindside's real life source material keeps it authentic.Now, if only every rich, white family in the Southern United States would take in an African American...oh, wait, that was abolished.

"Hopefully Michael Oher, Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy's story will inspire others to lend a helping hand","For those non-believers, naysayers and pessimists let me begin by unequivocally stating that the film The Blind Side is not a Christian based funded film, and the real Michael Oher's life has been embellished and timelines changed somewhat for the big screen. What cannot be disputed though is the fact that the Tuohy family most likely saved Michael Oher from being an impoverished youth with no bright future. Instead the Tuohy's who had the financial ability, but more importantly the willingness to bring a complete impoverished stranger into their home and blend in with their two existing children as a family unit.No doubt The Blind Side is an inspirational story that will tug at your heart strings, and you may even shed a few tears as Mrs. Shullivan and I both succumbed to, not once, but twice. Even the second time as we sat down to watch the film several years later after it was originally released. The portrayal by actor Quinton Aaron of the desperate and abandoned young Michael Oher is very real such that you wish you could help this young man yourself. Michael's relationship with the four (4) Tuohy family members especially the mother, Leigh Anne Tuohy played by Sandra Bullock was a relationship that exuded generosity, compassion and understanding. Sandra Bullock went on to win her first Oscar for her portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy and I would agree with the Academy members who voted for her. I also felt that Quinto Aaron was deserving of an Oscar nomination as his role was just as difficult and effective in generating empathy for the under privileged youth and how a persons life can be turned around if only given an opportunity to succeed within a decent environment and with a families support.The Blind Side will stand the test of time and may even inspire a few more families to open their hearts and their homes to a stranger who may need a helping hand. I give the film a high 9 out of 10 rating, and maybe by the third time I watch it again my rating may increase to a perfect 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very good film because it remembers that its story and characters are real,"Sometimes all it takes to make a movie is a good story with a director and a cast capable of seeing it for what it is. ""The Blind Side"" is an excellent example of why our interest continues to peak at the tagline ""based on a true story"" in movie trailers. You get the sense that Warner Bros, John Lee Hancock and star Sandra Bullock understand that the story they're telling is real, it's positive and it's heart-warming.""The Blind Side"" is the story of real-life football player Michael Oher, currently a left guard with the Baltimore Ravens who went from homeless to a first-round NFL pick with them help of the Tuohy family, who took him in and gave him the confidence to succeed at football and life. Although the details of the story have been stretched to make the film more dramatic, the essence of the story and the values it preaches are the same and they're what count most.Hancock has taken necessary liberties with the story. To be truthful, there's not a lot of bad or a lot of conflict and the film might have been too fluffy without exaggerations. The Tuohy's took Michael, a boy from a bad neighborhood who was enrolled in their school with some convincing from the football coach, and they helped him attain the grades to not only stay eligible in high school but also earn a scholarship to play football in college. Hancock resorts to a lot of dramatic conventions to keep the story engaging and the audience feeling sympathy for Michael but also excited to see him succeed. They all work, even if they're a bit cheap at times.The cast, however, really brings it all together. Everyone in this film natural and relatable. No one is written as or behaves like a stereotype or fit a specific mold -- at least none of the main characters. They realize they're playing real people leading normal lives. Only Jae Head as the little brother, S.J., tries hard to create humor where it doesn't come naturally but he gets away with being cute. The standout example of this is the hiring of all the real-life coaches to act as if they were in their former jobs and recruiting Michael. It seems gimmicky, but it's fun and it shows the effort to honor the truth of the story.As for Bullock, I've finally seen a film where she has really impressed me. I'm not sure about the Oscar talk, but I can't say a bad thing about her portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy. She creates such definitive portrait of Leigh Anne as tough, loving, selfless and even a bit abrasive. She plays her as sensitive and well-meaning where she could have just gone overboard with southern bell housewife stereotypes (considering we all know she's done plenty of over-the-top characters), but she realizes this is a real woman she's playing and gives Leigh Anne the dimension she deserves. Most importantly, she is naturally funny and doesn't shove humor down our throats like in her ditzy romantic comedy roles.""The Blind Side"" is a likable film, one way more about family and achieving ones goals than it is about football. This is not a cheesy, football-focused sports drama with typical sports themes and dramatizations of football games. Hancock understands the importance here is not football. This does make Bullock's bookend narration about how former football pro Lawrence Taylor changed the game of football for left tackles a bit irrelevant, but it serves as another reminder of how Michael Oher's story is real and it's an interesting and important one.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Not without Flaws, but shed a lot of tears","The blind side is not a biopic on Micheal but a family biopic that showcase the amazing changes one can do with family bonding.It is meant to be a heartwarming movie, but what makes it different from most other heartwarming movies is that the script is designed to make anyone waste off tissue boxes in every few scenes. The director certainly maintains the neutrality of the movie very well; he did not eliminate the stereotype issues like racism but instead embrace them just enough to be undetectable.However, this comes at its own costs of deterring from reality to a slightly more fairy tale-like sequence of events. For instance, the encounter of Leanne with the drug dealers, and the encounter with the real mother who, surprisingly, is much more stable and receptive of the situation than what I would expect (considering the actual timeline where the racial tension is supposed to be more vile?).Otherwise, this movie succeeded in draining a large water amount from me. And, yes, I think Bullock does deserve her Oscars, even though there may be other nominees more deserving. From her interview it was clear how much effort she put in to portray as close to the real person as possible but admitted that it is 'impossible because Leanne is simply original'.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A made-for-TV movie that somehow wandered into the ""Best Picture"" category","This movie could have been interesting. We could have learned all about the issues Michael Oher had to overcome in order to get to where he is today. We could have viewed his struggles up close, seen accounts of his rough past, and caught deep insight into his personality for an intimate portrait of the obstacles that too many American children face.Instead, the plot of ""The Blind Side"" went something like this: Lee Ann Tuohy is a wonderful person who does wonderful things. And some more wonderful things. And continues to do nothing but wonderful, wonderful things without any sort of real conflict, internal or otherwise. As a commenter on the message boards brilliantly put it, Michael Oher was a supporting character in his own damn story. ""The Blind Side"" was so self-righteous and self-congratulatory, it made me nauseous.I could probably type forever about the problems I had with this movie, but for the sake of brevity, here are some points:Why didn't the screenwriter take advantage of the MYRIAD of engaging topics that could have been explored in this movie? And I don't just mean race (although I was quite disappointed by it not actually being addressed). What about the kinds of psychological issues that adopted kids face all the time? Abandonment issues? Problems adjusting to the family dynamic? Survivor's Guilt? And did anyone in the rest of the Tuohey family experience apprehension about having a complete stranger stay in their house? Was there jealousy? Sibling rivalry? Oh wait, exploring those kinds of issues would have taken time away from showcasing what a wonderful, wonderful person Leigh Ann was.There's a very brief part in the film where Michael runs into his estranged brother. They embrace for a long time, but we don't hear anything they say to each other. Then he disappears, never to be mentioned again for the rest of the movie. What gives? What was his story? Why hadn't Michael seen him in so long? Where was he living? Would they ever see each other again? And what about the rest of Michael's background? We're only given vague details and momentary flashes. Why don't we actually get to learn about him, his past and his personality? Oh wait, that would have taken time away from showcasing what a wonderful, wonderful person Leigh Ann was.Okay, one of my biggest pet peeves in film is when little kids talk like adults. As far as I'm concerned, S.J. gets the brass ring in that department. He was seriously one of the most annoying creatures I've ever, ever seen on a movie screen. I wanted to punch him in the throat the second he delivered his first spoken line.I understand the concept of suspended disbelief. And if this movie had been a bit better, I would have been able to do just that. But come on, do they expect me to believe that Michael's poverty-stricken drug-addicted mother was not only lucid and coherent, but had perfect alabaster-white teeth? And really, a bunch of armed-to-the-teeth gang members living in the projects were intimidated into silence by a rich white lady? Are you kidding me?And since it's fresh in my mind...When compared to the caliber of performances of the other actresses, I can't believe the academy gave Sandra Bullock the Best Actress Oscar. What a joke.Long story short (too late), stay away. Unless you enjoy vomiting.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Entertaining, but irritatingly soft-to-the-touch","2.5/4There is something so undeniably inept about the way The Blind Side is presented. It's an entertaining movie, but it seems to dispel any hard facts, and glide thoughtlessly over big issues. This gives way to a movie that feels like it was carried by its many embellishments and heavily watered-down.This is based on the true story is of a 17-year-old names Michael Oher. He lives a life devoid of any opportunities. One day, a family takes him in, sends him to a prestigious private school, teaches him how to play football, and ultimately lands him on the Baltimore Ravens. It's a truly great story, but it was told in a very glib manner. It was also told in an arguably degrading way towards its real-life counterpart. In case you didn't know, Michael Oher himself has been vocal about that.The acting and character interactions were quality, and probably the best aspect of this movie. Sandra Bullock gives a powerful, if not over-acted, female lead. When the characters don't feel like they're putting on an act, they're actually quite charming.What is left of the movie runs together much in the manner of a train crash for me. The story seems to rushed to give its own merits any attention. The movie glides in-and-out of focus of what it needs to do: shed light on the issues it introduced. While it told a story well, it didn't leave you thinking about the movie.Overall, The Blind Side is extraordinarily average. It's neither memorable for its football, nor its drama, and it doesn't give a true story a good movie-screen experience. Remember The Titans? I wish.",,Anonymous,Biography
Did It Really Happen This Way?,"This is a decent story about decent people. What it lacks is a sense that all this happened. When one has a recent biographical film, we wonder how much is created to move the story along. Take a fun football film like ""Remember the Titans."" It is based in the fact of busing and segregation. Did it really happen that way? Did those guys really bond that way. Or did they pretty much accept the fact that football requires them to put up or shut up. It's still a great story, as is this one. The real story is the fact that a wealthy white woman who actually exists brought Michael Oher into her home. All the details surrounding this may have been brushed over a bit. I feel it's missing a down and dirty part. Even the confrontations in the neighborhood a bit sanitized. It's a good human story; I just have a sneaking suspicion that some liberties were taken.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful message but bad approach,"I managed to catch a preview of the so called inspirational football saga THE BLIND SIDE. Based on a true story, the message tells us, regardless of what horrible background you have in life, what sort of set-backs, you can push yourself to be a winner. This is nice, but what kills the film is the character Sandra Bullock plays. She is very self-righteous defiant (She is photographed too often with a sneer and arms crossed) soccer mom type. She comes across more like ""I need to show who is boss, who is tough..."" as opposed to ""Gee, I want to help this kid."" The slum-kid she is helping usually has a sad beaten-puppy expression -like the only way this guy can help himself is if a tough-love spitting python like Ms. Bullock comes along. The film-makers are clearly tiring to win over the soccer-mom crowd, which they may do and help this film gain a profit, but others may be turned off by Sandy's ""I'm a B---- because I can be.""",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Blind Side,"The Blind Side rode sentimental appeal, a star performance, and a respectable box office draw to an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The film tells the true story of Michael Oher, a homeless teenager who became an NFL player and college graduate with the help of a loving family (played by Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw).The story runs into the same problem as another 2009 film, Invictus, in the sense that by being true to the events as they happened, there is a lack of conflict.In the real-life counterpart Blind Side, I might have expected, due to the fact that the story takes place in Central Tennessee and a white family is taking in a black teenager that it would be story largely about racism. In real life, however, Leigh Ann Tuohy was remarkably colorblind and so was her husband and the movie doesn't dare contradict that. A couple confused relatives and a suspicious NCAA infractions investigator is about all we get for a reminder of racial tension in the deep south, but hey, it's the post-racial era, what can we expect?In spite of that, this is a picture that works. The drama is authentic but it also engages because it's centered around a struggle that takes many forms and stages: the central figure has to learn to open himself up, to trust, to succeed on the field and in the classroom, etc.As for the acting, Sandra Bullock has a strong consistency to the way she approaches the character. The real-life woman is somewhat of an enigma in her motivations and Bullock makes it believable.Quinton Aaron is amazing and had as much of a role in carrying the movie as Bullock. He has such presence (partially because of his size) but appears so uncomfortable with that presence at first and gradually transform into it.Kathy Bates shouldn't be so heavily advertised because her role basically amounts to a cameo.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Film: All-Around Excellence; Bullock: An Understated, Powerful Masterpiece","Everyone involved in this film's production must have been at the very peak of their game- no pun intended- because the movie fires on all cylinders and continues to do so after every genuinely earned laugh, genuinely earned tear, and genuinely earned ear-to-ear smile. In fact, that is a better ""Summary"" for this film- genuine. The adjective works. I found myself entranced by the humor the writer injected into the dialogue and banter interspersed between a poignant biographical drama. I found myself astounded at what great cinema can achieve- a panoramic, lyrical look at race at an individual level, and what one individual's kindness and love can transform in another's life. All in all, a film that reminds you how the truest stories are the ones that leave you speechless, with eyes watering.Above all, Bullock absolutely won me over. She takes the film not only to another level, but to a Best Actress nomination for herself, and perhaps even a Best Picture nod. Her acting is subtle, understated brilliance, yet hard and powerful when she needs to be. Actresses like Kate Winslet and Julianne Moore could even- WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT!?- take a lesson here- in places where Bullock could have cried, could have shouted, could have done any number of Hollywoodized set pieces, she restrains herself and lets the story, and the life of her character, tell this story. I will be very surprised if she doesn't get, at the very least, a nomination. She certainly deserves it. Kudos!",,Anonymous,Biography

"Excellent story, Amazing Acting","Where to start? I've watched this film several times since it came out and every single time I fall in love with it all over again.Sandra Bullock earned every inch of her Academy Award. Her portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy has to be, to date, the best of her career (and my all time favourite of her performances). Even when Tuohy is cold or harsh, you still fall for her. Love and empathy just radiates from her character, no matter the situation.Another honorable mention goes to Quinton Aaron playing the wayward teenager, Michael Oher. Initially, he exudes the lack of self confidence and childlike qualities that you would expect from a kid that has been abandoned by his drug dependant mother. After being bounced around the system, he ends up couch surfing for a while but ultimately ends up homeless when he meets the Tuohy's.You don't have to love Football to love this movie, but it sure is better if you do!Excellent movie; well worth your time!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Same old Cheesy American Garbage,"The characters were pretty two-dimensional, and were for the most part as transparent as glass. That is to say, you'll feel no sense of intrigue when introduced to the characters because you'll know exactly who they are and what their place is in the film as soon as they first appear. This is with exception to 'Michael' who was really the 'main' character of the film. Nonetheless, I felt this movie was more about everyone else being nice to him rather than being about him and the turmoil he had face being a young African-American coming from an impoverished background. Therefore you'll find that the one character you want to know more about remains some what of a mystery for the extent of the movie.The one character that stands out in this film is 'leigh Anne tuohy', played by Sandra Bullock. This character was 'The Blind Sides' biggest down side. She came across as being arrogant and self-righteous for the duration of the film. And although the character was supposed to be a heroine, it seemed to me the only reason she was doing the things she did was so she could feel smug and good about herself.Although the story itself was quite 'nice' and had some sentiment behind it, I found it very tedious to watch. There was no conflict of any kind in this movie and the plot was so predictable I felt like I knew what was going to happen before even the writers did.I understand that some people enjoy 'feel-good' movies, and on occasions, so do I. But this movie takes the genre to a whole new level- to the extent where you're just praying for something bad to happen to one of the characters just to add a bit of depth to the movie.If I were going to sum up the plot of this movie in one sentence it would be; things start off OK, they get better, everyone's happy, things get even better, every feels great, the end. If I were going to sum it up in one word it would be 'cheese'.If you're looking for a low brow, feel good movie that isn't going to make you think than this is the movies for you. If you want to sit down for an hour and fifty minutes and watch something that's going to make you feel so good about life that you're probably gunna want to puke afterwards then watch this film.The only reason I've given this movie a half decent rating is because I can see the merits of it, despite the fact I found it quite boring to watch. The dialogue, for the most part, is pretty good and the direction was brilliant. I just felt that it was poor story telling, for the reason that there was no real story- at least not one worthy of being made into a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
the most heart warming film ever,"let me say that this is my review for any movie in IMDb and i am mighty proud to say that its for THE BLIND SIDE. Its undoubtedly the best film i have seen in 2009 and to say that its a movie for the Oscars would not be too far fetched but nevertheless i must say that i have never seen such a heart warming film for a long time.Let us be clear that in a world which is dominated by power and money and politics for a young boy to come out of despair and doom into a world of fame opportunity and a good life is nothing short of a miracle ,but here we see how a sweet family adopts a total stranger as their their child and nurtures the child and motivates the child not just to come out of desolation and despair but to rise to the position of an All star American football star. It is such good films which make me realize that along with so much corruption and hatred and terrorism in this world there are still such good people in this world who make the world we live in a much better place . i am proud to give it a 10/10 rating as it made tears to roll out of my eyes not out of sympathy for the football player but out of joy that good people with a good heart can still be happy and successful in this world",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Entertaining Feel Good Movie,"The Blind Side is a Hollywood feel-good movie. My wife and I saw it with some friends and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. We found it uplifting, inspiring and often funny. However, I saw this movie reviewed on At The Movies and it was given a terrible review so it's not for everyone. The film is based on a true story and was written and directed by John Lee Hancock (The Rookie, The Alamo).Sandra Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy a wealthy Memphis decorator. She and her husband send their two kids to a posh private school. One of the students is Big Mike (Quinton Aaron) a poor, homeless black teenager who has been given a football scholarship. Big Mike has an awful life, his mother is a drug addict and he has no father. The Tuohy family find Mike walking in the rain, they take him in and he becomes a member of the family. Big Mike is renamed Michael and becomes a high school football star.Bullock is brilliant as a tough Southern lady with a heart of gold. She turns Michael's life around by providing him with a loving home and hires a tutor to make sure he gets into college. She even on occasion helps to coach the team. Overall, the Blind Side is an enjoyable and entertaining movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Terrific Inspirational Movie,"I saw it twice in three days. The last time I have done that was with The Sound of Music when it came out in 1965. Sandra Bullock should get an Oscar. The entire cast did a great job.When you see this movie, you know there are good people and you know there is a God. I thought it did a good job of portraying the value of each and every person as equal. Maybe different with different circumstances but of equal value.What a good example of using the blessings you have to help others, to lift them up and to help theme get on their way in life. I fought back the tears several times.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Motivational and Heartwarming,"""The Blind Side"" is a feel-good and inspiring sports film based on the true story of NFL player Michael Oher. Directed by John Lee Hancock, the film expertly blends football with a tale of family and love.The movie ""The Blind Side"" pokes into the theme of the power of compassion and the impact of unconditional love, as well as the strength it can bring a person. The story revolves around Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), a loving family-first woman who takes in a homeless teenager named Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron). Leigh Anne's non-stop work to help Michael adapt to a new environment sets the stage for a powerful narrative that addresses the potential for greatness in unexpected places.The film touches on important themes such as race, privilege, and the power of empathy. It shows us the harsh realities faced by lower-class people in society, and how one act of kindness can create a profound impact on their lives. ""The Blind Side"" emphasizes the significance of breaking down social barriers and reaching out to those everywhere.A film with a similar theme would be ""Remember the Titans"" (2000). Both films share the same empowering message of tearing down racial barriers within sports. In the film, a high school plagued with racism learns to work together in an example of a football team and eliminate these problems.The transformation of Michael is depicted in montages throughout the film, which are one of the greatest ways I was able to keep my attention during the film. This showed his growth in football, but this directly translated to his growth in character as well. Another film technique used was lighting. The lighting of a scene had a large impact on what was happening. For example, whenever there was a bright light shining down on Michael it was usually during one of his large achievements.In conclusion, ""The Blind Side"" is a moving and uplifting film that highlights the power of love and the importance of family. With outstanding performances and a heartfelt story, it's no wonder this film has people rewatching over a decade later. Whether you're a sports fan or simply appreciate a touching tale, ""The Blind Side"" is a perfect fit.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A real good feel good movie!,"I enjoyed myself. I left the theater feeling good and I had no qualms towards this movie. All the actors did their thing and very well cast. I know that this movie seems like it's been done a million times, Someone well off helping the less fortunate, which is why i was apprehensive at first but after seeing it that didn't take anything away from it. The fact it was well done and based on a real life story gives it creditability. A good and safe movie for a date or for the family whatever your demographic.

Vehicle film? Football film? Or Stevie Wonder biopic? What is The Blind Side?,"There's a certain time of year when I attend the cinema's on a very frequent basis. This time in Australia is usually the summer period. However, I am not usually frequenting to the cinema to see the summer blockbuster releases, like the good majority of cinema patrons. Summer cinema release does not mean summer blockbuster to me, but instead equates to the Academy Award contenders.In this time, I see pretty much any film that is a sure fire flick to be nominated for an Academy Award. This surge in cinema viewing that occurs across the world can be seen as one of the huge upsides to the very controversial award giving group that is synonymous with shaky and questionable choices.In this time leading up to the Academy Awards, I became aware of an advance screening of John Lee Hancock's The Blind Side, a football family drama about a Southern family who takes in a disadvantaged black youth and aid him along with love, support and encouragement all the way to the NFL.This is not my usual type of film that I attend. The family friendly feel good, ""you can do anything if you have love"" story does not usually fly on my radar for too long before I wipe it off, let alone a sports film. However, The Blind Side had a leg up being nominated for Best Picture Oscar, and having its star, Sandra Bullock, as the frontrunner to win the Best Actress prize. So with this reason in toe, I speed off to see it in it's advanced release. And boy did it surprise me.Set in Memphis, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy (played by Tim McGraw and Bullock) discover Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) walking in the rain one night, with a dirty shirt in his plastic bag as his only possession and nowhere to stay. You can pretty much guess what happens from here on end. The usual conflicts and resolutions follow in a very neat order, which is to be expected of a Hollywood produced film with a Hollywood superstar as it's leading attraction. And yet, somehow, I found myself continually smiling and wanting to bursts out into applause for many different reasons. Most importantly, there is the issue of representation of race.The last year in cinema has seen two different and interesting portrayals of disadvantages black youths. In Lee Daniel's Precious, we see an physically and sexually abused and overweight 16 year old girl, who is pregnant with her second baby from her father, and who cannot read. With the aid of a teacher, she manages to breakthrough and discover above all else, the power of love.The similarities are seen within The Blind Side in this regard, which A. O. Scott sees in an article he wrote a few months ago in the New York Times (click here to read it). Scott notes that both films portray the disadvantaged youths as overcoming their obstacles with the help of teachers (in Precious) and a rich Southern white skinned family (in The Blind Side). The message that seems to be reiterated in the final moments of The Blind Side, is that without this aid, these kids would just be another causality in a poor, disadvantaged, ghetto life.There have also been critiques, which Scott among others acknowledge, that see Precious as further perpetuating a negative stereotype, whereas The Blind Side is being more delicate about the issue of race, yet at the same time propelling an idea of a fairytale saviour through the guise of a wealthy white family.After seeing these two films in a period of a week, I would have to strongly disagree that either one perpetuates any negative stereotype regarding race. While these issues are questioned, both films instead swim in the notion of overcoming adversity through the support of well wishing and benevolent forces.To this matter, both of these films are based on true stories, with The Blind Side being explicitly based on the story of Michael Oher, and Precious being based upon an amalgamation of many girls like the main character, written by ""Sapphire"" (a pseudonym for Romona Lofton, teaching in the projects of Harlem).Being made for a fairly modest Hollywood budget of $27 million dollars, The Blind Side has received extremely successful critical reception as well as impressive box office takings. In it's opening weekend, it came second only to New Moon raking in $34 million. However, in it's second weekend, the film took in $40 million, a large step up, which is so rarely heard of. The Blind Side has also been the first film to make over $200 million with having a female name receiving sole top billing over the film.The film has been Bullock's most successful box office draw and has drowned her in awards from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (the Golden Globes), Critics Choice, Screen Actor's Guild and what I predict (although an easy prediction to make) an Academy Award.The Blind Side is rounded off with very good performances by Aaron, McGraw, Kathy Bates and Ariane Lenox (who plays Michael's drug addicted mother, and who in real life won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Mrs Muller in the Original Broadway production of John Patrick Shanley's Doubt).While it is a cliché filled film, it still succeeds in presenting all the necessarily elements of a successful family sports drama. Great story, great performances, and leaves you with a great warm feeling.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Shades of Walt Disney,"This relentlessly feel good movie strives and succeeds in all it sets out to do. It reassures us all that not only is all well with the world, it really is a pretty wonderful place. Walt Disney would be proud.Disney's family fare of the sixties portrayed characters as totally one dimensional. The mean were mean, the kind were kind, etc. etc. Characters simply had no inner conflicts or doubts. Audiences, particularly children, found this spoon fed story telling very enjoyable. If only life were that simple.Well in ""The Blind Side"" life is that simple. The characters in the movie are unashamedly one dimensional. This good natured family doesn't bat an eyelid about taking in an underprivileged over-sized young black teenager into their smart home. They might as well have picked up a stray pet. Those squeaky clean smiling children take to Big Mike from the projects without a hint of hesitation.There is nothing wrong with movies reaffirming the basic goodness of mankind. God knows there are enough that have succeeded in proving the opposite. But pandering to the need to believe in such goodness in such a simplistic, needless to say, unrealistic manner is misguided. It's making us feel good at the cost of integrity - and succeeding.Sandra Bullock does with the role exactly what she's demanded to do and that really is not very much in the way of an acting stretch. We've seen her good nature shine numerous times before. Why this time it garnered her an Oscar is very probably as she herself put it, shesimply wore them down.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

I have always believed that you should live your life keeping in mind that you may be the only Bible someone ever reads. Leigh Ann lived the Christian life. It was reflected in her actions every day.

The movie Blind Side was a very inspiration movie,"What we have is a young black kid at the age of seventeen yrs. old with a large body who grew up in the projects in Memphis, Tenn. He left his mother; because, she was a drug addicted, and he slept wherever he laid his head down; because, he did not want to be around that entire negative environment. With Michael's homeless circumstances, Tony Hamilton, Omar Dorsey like a father figure let him stay with his family. One day Tony introduced his son Steven, and Michael Ora, Quinton Araon to football Coach Burt Cotton, Ray McKinnon from Wingate Christian School a private school that may benefit the school's football program; because, of Michael's sizes, and moves. With a GPA.0.6 Michael was accepted to the school, and Michael started going to classes at Wingate. The teachers said, Michael Oher was unteachable, but there was this science teacher, Mrs. Boswell, Kim Dicken who believed in Michael, and needed a special tutor to help him get through school. There was this lady Mrs. Tuohy, Sandra Bullock mother of two kids one named Collins, Lily Collins, and S.J., Jae Head, and her husband name was Mr. Tuohy Tim McGraw the owner of a many Taco Bells who took Michael in has a family member to stay one night, but that one night turned out to be a lot of extra days, to weeks, months, and years of love, and emotions for both. This was an investment; because, Mrs. Tuohy was very patience with Michael as a young teenage so he could fulfill his dream as a human being, and a pro football player the left tackle for Wingate's football team. With Michael's academic problems in the way would prohibit extra activities; because, of his learning abilities, and his life beyond school, and he may not be able to play football. The People around town were asking questions to all the Tuohy's family members why they brought Michael Oher into their family. The theme that I like when the Tuohy family took to kindness; because, this family was friendly to people, help the poor, help other students giving Michael a place of growing up in a positive environment. The Tuohy family helped Michael Oher get his life on track when they noticed he was having problems in school. The Tuohy family proceeded giving him attention, and to get him a special patience tutors that helped him in the long term to graduate. This story of Michael Oher a 17yrs old boy who was homeless, and came from a broken home, and needed some guidance in the right direction to become a NFL draft pick behind love, kindness, and care coming from Mrs. Tuohy, and the family. In my opinion the acting was graces; especially Michael Oher, Quinton Araon acting the age of a 17 yr. old boy being that big with those basketball, and football moves, and taking his time using that graces acting role with a learning disability. What a way to act, being patience, and the way he talk the script, and moving his body language slow in certain scenes.The movie Miracle on ice is one of those family movies that the whole family can enjoy. The themes in this movie are just like the movie Blind Side where there is teamwork involved, leadership, and Mrs. Tuohy family dynamics; between Coach Burton, and the teachers who tutored him. They all helped him avoid negative language, and any bad behaviors to become a Michael Oher miracle for the Tuohy family; especially Mrs. Tuohy. Miracle, and Blind side, these two movies show what awesome things ordinary human beings can achieve when they believe in one self. With the juxtaposition close, long, mid, and full shots of Michael's neighborhood this gave the audience a feel of Michael's world living in the hood of Memphis, Tenn. The camera shots angles are used to show Michael's life in the hood and a complete full circle of his life being turned around, and being able to adapt to a wealthy family. These kinds of camera angles for example panning and tracking shots, show a group of black youngsters hanging out in the hood on the steps, faces full of hate, and lust like gangster faces; especially when Mrs. Tuohy Sandra Bullock pays a visit to Michael's hood. In my opinion it was the scene In Blind Side first movie where Coach Burton kept telling or yelling at Michael Oher no do not pick up that offensive player, and carry him, and Coach Burton kept going over the plays with the team, again, again, again; especially with the balloons in the air, and everybody stop, and looked at them; while, Coach Burton was yelling they are just balloons, back to practice over, and over repeatedly. This was the same theme as Miracle, Again, Again, Again trailer where you showed us in class two weeks ago a repeatedly motifs where Kurt Russel the coach kept telling his team again, again, again on the ice sprints. Courage can be like pulling at rabbit out of a top hat casting a magical spell telling it what to do wishing there was a rabbit in that hat. Any ordinary person can be brave, but have honor, that is life you make it happen or you do not make it happen. You hope for a Miracle again, again, again, and have the courage, honor to believe in oneself to win a Michael Oher, and the miracle on ice back in 1980.",,Anonymous,Biography

A Nutshell Review: The Blind Side,"Much of the hype in this film comes from Sandra Bullock's fine performance as Leigh Ann Tuohy, a God fearing rich woman who had chosen to adopt a kid off the street out of plain human compassion, offer him a home, school, even introduced him to football, and essentially turned his life around without ever wanting anything back in return. Incredible as it may sound, it's actually based on the true story of Michael Oher's life given a new lease to stay off the streets, and the opportunities extended to him as part of the Tuohy family, to turn him into the pro-footballer he is today.And this heartwarming story reminds us that while it's easy to pay lip service to charitable organizations, or at times feel overwhelmed with the myriad of societal issues that need fixing, all it takes is that small step forward to spark a massive change for the better, especially when help comes from within and from an honest and sincere heart. We cannot change the world and cure it of all its ills, but it's the little things that we do within our capacity that will make the most difference and impact.The story may not be something new, and you've probably watched countless of films with similar themes and the fusion of inspiration and sports. Moreover, some may feel that the rich characters here have within their means to extend help, but pay no heed to that, because just how many out there would find it compelling to do something like what the Tuohys did? And I kid you not when I say the marketing of the film tried to pass this off like a cliché rags to riches film where a character finds his true calling in American football or learn about values such as teamwork and group above self and so on. It's not exactly a sports or football movie, but one about compassion, change and the belief that with effort comes result for a fellow human being who had been tossed an unfair circumstance to cope with.Sandra Bullock's come a long way from the days of driving a bus in Speed, to various average romantic flicks, and finally settling in a role that calls for plenty of gravitas, which she pulled off wonderfully. In Erin Brockovich style complete with blonde hair, Southern drawl and Maximizer bra, she plays Leigh Anne as the tough cookie who gets her way and never takes no for an answer, which explains how what may seem like a whim, turn and become something of a crusade in genuinely fighting a prejudiced system to get others to open up to Big Mike / Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) and get to engage with the quiet boy in more meaningful ways through out of the box techniques. I have never seen Sandra Bullock come close to playing any character like Leigh Anne, and this is indeed busting any preconceived glass ceiling that dramas are not her forte.Quinton Aaron also provided that perfect pairing opposite Bullock as the lumbering giant with a heart of gold, knowing that his strength is not in the physical sense (not that he doesn't have that in abundance), but in his innate ability for ball games and protective intuition. He may be slow in learning, but he's not stupid, contrary to many especially his teachers who seem resigned to the fact that he cannot be taught subjects through the proper schooling channel. Aaron plays this role with plenty of sentimentalism and sensitivity, that it's extremely hard not to empathize, nor to feel for him when the chips are down or to cheer and root for him even when good things happen.And the rest of the cast, especially Tim McGraw, Jae Head and Lily Collins all add a little sparkle as members of the Tuohy family (who owns a chain of fast food franchises) who because of Leigh Anne, all learn to accept and embrace Michael as one of their own. Kathy Bates round off the wonderful cast when she enters the picture in the final act as Miss Sue, Michael's personal tutor engaged to ensure he passes high school with a decent GPA needed to further his studies as well as the sport of choice.The Blind Side will open up your eyes to a worthwhile ""true life"" story that you should be aware of, and be inspired from, and I'd say Sandra Bullock should be quite the shoo-in for the Golden Globe, and way overdue for an Oscar as well. Highly recommended as her performance alone is well worth the ticket price!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Who would have thought we'd have a black son before we had a democrat?,"The Blind Side is written and directed by John Lee Hancock. It stars Sandra Bullock, Quinton Aaron, Tim McGraw, Jae Head, Lily Collins and Kathy Bates. Music is scored by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Alar Kivilo.17 year old Michael Oher (Aaron) has been denied a stable upbringing in a loving family, wandering the streets devoid of an education of note and perhaps one step away from falling in with the wrong crowd? Big Mike is taken in by Leigh Anne Tuohy (Bullock) and her family. Motives and means will be questioned elsewhere, but Leigh Anne taps into Big Mike's psyche and unearths a potential football star, but he, and the Tuhoy family, must overcome obstacles first.A big hit at the box office whilst garnering Bullock the Academy award for Best Actress, The Blind Side is proof positive that in a world that is often crappy, a simple button pushing movie can soar high and provide airy relief. Based on a true story, the film never lacks for emotional thrust, it is undeniably a sweet, and at times, uplifting picture, yet it lacks a dramatic edge, a boldness to really make the story grab you around the throat, forcing us to gasp for the emotional air floating up there in the sky. There's a tangible feeling of manipulation, a good ole whitey saves the down on his luck black fella narrative, where regardless of truth, it's a bit annoying to see Michael Oher (you know, the guy who the story is about) playing second fiddle throughout.With scenes involving Oher's mother (Adriane Lenox) lacking any emotional gravitas and the trips to the Ghetto devoid of genuine grit, Hancock is fortunate that the audience reaching out for some uplift was prepared to forgive these errors. That he had Bullock on top form also helps considerably. He should be commended for getting a performance of such unswerving charisma from her, even if it relegates everyone else around her to the sidelines. It was a role Bullock kept turning down (it had been offered to Julia Roberts first), she wasn't sure she could portray well enough such as strong religious lady as Leigh Anne Tuhoy, but eventually she signed on and etched her name into the annals of Academy Award winners.If it's the best actress performance of 2009 is up for much debate, as is if it is even Bullock's best career performance in fact? But undeniably it's a star turn that manages to hide the failings lurking under the sweetly stitched quilt pieced together by Hancock. In Bullock's hands the Tuhoy character holds our attention throughout with a mixture of strength, spunk and unflinching beliefs. If she's shouting down a redneck idiot, correcting a football coach or fronting up to a big mouth Ghetto leader, she has us firmly on side and eating out of her hands. She's the main draw card here, which is both a blessing and a hindrance. Best to roll up for this one expecting to be moved and cheered, but be prepared for a lack of complexity and guts. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastic Film!,"As I walked into the theater, I must admit I was unsure of what I would think of this film. Mainly, I questioned whether Sandra Bullock could pull off a much more serious role than what she is used too. As I watched this film I could not help but notice how many times I would catch myself smiling. The Blindside is truly an inspirational story about Family, Friendship, Faith, and Will. In most films I see now-a-days that involve Christianity, I feel they normally show a terrible portrayal of what it is about and ultimately makes Christians look very judgmental and radical when that is far from it. It brings up the question of, what would God want you to do in this situation? Sandra Bullock was excellent in the movie as Leigh Anne Tuohy, the mother of two children who go to school with Michael Oher. As I watched this movie, seeing a portrayal of a proper southern upper class woman take in a poor black teenager and embrace him with open arms as if he were her own, I could not help but question myself on what would I have done if I had been in her position. Quinton Aaron who plays Michael Oher was very good in his role. His emotions and how he acted really helped me relate too him and better understand the positions he is in. His apprehensive, shy demeanor is exactly how I would've expected anyone to act if they were in his situation. There are many scenes in the film that honestly made me wish I could just reach out and embrace this gentle giant. Another thing that I really liked about the film was the involvement in college recruitment as that is one thing that I am extremely passionate about.In conclusion, I felt that in my personal opinion, The Blindside may be one of the top 3 sports films I have seen and may top Remember the Titans as the top football movie of all time. Again, this is my personal opinion. This film will truly inspire those who watch it!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A touching story based on a true story, but In the end, ""The Blind Side"" is the remake of a series of other titles that we've seen out there, told in a better way","Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) is a young black teenager, much older than his peers, poor and almost illiterate. He wins a school scholarship for his greatest talent: playing football. But that doesn't stop him from suffering all kinds of prejudice. The only one who pays attention to him is a little boy who is also a student at the institution. Michael becomes friends with the boy, which catches the attention of his mother, Leigh Anne Touhy (Sandra Bullock). This, in turn, ends up being touched by the boy's story and sees in him a potential not only as an athlete, but as a human being.It is the dreams that serve as fuel to move the gears of life, both individual and collective. The Blind Side, written and directed by John Lee Hancock, is largely about that. But mainly about the desires that are developing with each new minute and that start to transform into ideals, philosophies, realizations, and eventually, into collective hysteria. We have these yearnings for ourselves, then for our family, and over time they can extend to anyone who catches our attention in a more special way. It doesn't matter their size or the degree of difficulty, the important thing is to always keep running after them. It can certainly be said that ""The Blind Side"" is a film full of good intentions, but that unfortunately enters with force in the field of superficiality. The script follows the ""feel good movie"" style, a narrative model about people in search of personal accomplishments in the midst of the oppressive and not always achievable American way of life.The Blind Side is your typical Thanksgiving family drama, but it also goes beyond the stereotype by showing the points of view of lives so far apart that collided and how that clash affected the situations around them. The narrative here prefers to stay on reliable ground, showing how even in the face of difficulties it is still possible to dream. How there are good people, and how you need to trust more and distrust less. It is a film that came at the right time, reminding us that we need to have more generosity of spirit, that we are more peaceful and open to listen, observe and absorb new experiences and emotions. You have to look at the whole and not just part of the whole.However, one of the main problems of The Blind Side is focus. Apparently, the director (who is also the screenwriter) did not know how to answer a basic question: what is this film about? Well, the answer would have to be: from the life of a guy named Michael Oher. So the attention should be focused on him and not Leigh. This even seems obvious to me, after all, the film assumes itself as a biography of the player. By making Leigh the protagonist, The Blind Side turns Michael into a supporting character in his own story. It is clear that the option for an actress of the caliber and with the box office potential of a Sandra Bullock, indicates that her character was conceived as the main one from the beginning. But in this case the error is in the proposal itself, in the very concept from which it starts. The Blind Side is a critical case of a film that suffers from an identity crisis.Leigh's election as the protagonist undermines Oher's character development. Little is known about her past. We only see - in flashes - that he was taken away from his mother as a child. From the father, we hear a brief comment about his death in a car accident. We don't have any information about his childhood, who he lived with, who raised him, who his other siblings are and how much these difficulties shaped his adolescence. In certain moments of the film, it is noticed that the script creates certain situations so that we could get to know Oher in more depth. But all of them are wasted even gratuitously. At one point, Oher finds one of his brothers working as a waiter. They warmly embrace. Haven't seen each other for years. Unfortunately, the script does not realize the potential of the scene and does not even allow us to hear the words exchanged by both. Instead, the focus of the scene is on Leigh's reaction outside the restaurant. To make matters worse, the brother does not reappear in the film and the sequence is loose and without function within the plot. Later on, Oher returns home to see his mother, but he can only find his childhood friends, always surrounded by women, drinks, guns and chains around their necks. Again, nothing so deep comes out off this.The problems aren't limited to Oher's character development. The film practically does not address the theme of racism (the only mention is in a dialogue between Leigh and her friends in a restaurant), making it clear that Michael's life, after being welcomed by the Touhy family, was relatively peaceful. In addition, the script does not explore an interesting bias opened by the story, about the conflict between the Republican Leigh (at a certain point in the film, she defends President George Bush as the only one capable of putting order in a public office) and the Democrat Miss Sue (Kathy Bates), Oher's private tutor.Finally, in a story as painful as Oher's, the script's lack of dramatic conflict is impressive and uncomfortable. The children accept the figure of a new sibling without any objection. There is no hint of jealousy or mistrust. On the contrary, they see you as a new friend and welcome you with open arms. The husband, in turn, is the ultimate example of understanding and passivity. At one point, the son suffers a car accident that was driven by Oher (the scene indicates that he was partly to blame for the event) and the couple does not even think about giving him a reprimand or applying a punishment. Even worse is the investigation scene, whose anticlimactic outcome calls into question the director's own option to make use of the flashback.Despite all these problems, not everything is wrong in The Blind Side. Sandra Bullock's interpretation deserves mention. Although the Oscar received has more to do with her moment in the film industry and also with the fragility of the competitors, the actress does well in the characterization of a character who had everything to fall into the stereotype. There are no exaggerations, no faces and mouths. Bullock opted for a very low-key performance, in which less is more. This minimalist side adapts to the personality of a confident, secure woman who knows how to achieve her goals in a serene and discreet way. And Bullock still adds many subtle comic moments, which fit perfectly with the proposal.Oher is played by the unknown Quinton Aaron, who also does very well. His character is of few words, which shifts the performance to gestures and looks. And in that respect, Aaron manages to convey the necessary vulnerability and neediness. The relationship between Bullock and Aaron, which was key to the film's success, convinces and makes us, at certain times, even root for that duo. The rest of the cast does not have an exposure time that allows them to gain greater visibility. Anyway, Kathy Bates is doing as well as ever and child actor Jae Head manages to be one of the most irritating kids in recent memory. To be fair, the fault may not even be his, but the text, which insists on making him much more adult than his chronological age (there is a regrettable line in which Sean Jr., his character, demands that the director of the University, say, a special favor).With the unoriginal direction of John Lee Hancock, who innocuously follows the rules of a Hollywood drama, the film is touching, but borders on the artificial - it is made to reach the viewer's emotions. We have a love story here. Not the romantic love experienced so many other times on the big screen, but an altruistic love, which is willing to donate to others without expecting anything in return. Thus, the success that the film had in the United States is understandable, even more so knowing that it is based on the true story of the current striker for the Baltimore Ravens, told in the book The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game. A Possible Dream found in its audience that side that believes in the Greater Good, but lacks the courage to take matters into its own hands. So, it is even easier to project onto Leigh Anne Toughy the hopes of a charitable and altruistic humanity and leave the cinema believing that it is really possible to help others.Even so, some moments are so perfectly happy that they sound corny, like the scene where the two brothers train and exercise, having fun and laughing. Practically a margarine commercial. At the same time, Hancock innovates and shows all his creativity and courage in certain situations, such as the excellent first minutes, in which, in a didactic way and explaining through real scenes of a ""football"" game, he warns that we are entering a sports world admired by its directors.In the end, it can be said that The Blind Side is the remake of a series of other titles that we've seen out there and told in a better way, including. There are works that deal with baseball (The Rookie), basketball (Hoosiers, Glory Road, Coach Carter), golf (The Greatest Game Ever Played), and American football itself (Challenging Giants, Remember the Titans, Friday Night Lights, Moneyball, We're Marshall). Perhaps precisely for this reason, this characteristic of approaching something already known, explains its enormous success with the American public, but the lack of originality makes ""The Blind Side"" a film on the verge of being dispensable. Finished in a way that has become standard for current films that re-enact true events, the closing credits are accompanied by photos and videos of the family in question. Symmetrically represented, real and fictional are confused. Nothing more common in a world where real life is too good to be true.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good Whites Save Blacks Again,"I did not like the film. It sickened me and was offensive to African Americans. Again, Hollywood's racist stereotypical images of Blacks prevailed on the silver screen. The film was reminiscent of the racist film ""Birth of a Nation"". This film in no way reflected the daily lives of all Black people. 90% of Blacks are hardworking, educated and principled. Persons who love their families and have productive lives.List of Stereotypes1. A drug abusing mother who abandons her children. 2. A filthy neighborhood full of drug dealers, unemployed residents, criminals & a filthy trash laden environment. 3. The stereotypical angry Black woman Social Worker. 4. The strong intact White family rescuing Blacks from themselves. 5. Maternal & Paternal Whites who know what's best for Blacks.This film was offensive on so many levels. This film was entertainment for Whites not persons of color. Please post. America still is not ready to deal with real discussions centered on race.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Plain Decency,"Sandra Bullock catches our attention when her Leigh Anne Tuohy says, ""Don't you dare lie to me!"" She had asked Big Mike (silently strong Quinton Aaron) if he had a place to sleep for the night in the pouring rain. Bullock commands the screen in ""The Blind Side"". She is smart, sassy, and strong—brilliantly deflecting a gentle soul not easily moved. My friend Robert told me, ""Sandra Bullock rocks!"" That says it all. I also think that Bullock gets an Oscar nod for her heart felt and powerful performance. Director and Writer John Lee Hancock's ""The Blind Side"" is based on the book by Michael Lewis which tells the inspiring true story of Michael Oher. Oher was a homeless black kid, taken in by the Tuohy family, who became an All-American Football Player drafted in the first round by the Baltimore Ravens. Oher is now starting left offensive lineman—protecting the quarterback's blind side. ""The Blind Side"" celebrates the decency in all people. I was touched by and enjoyed ""The Blind Side"". And much like the title, one is blind sided by the decency of people. I love this movie.Leigh Anne (Bullock) is married to Taco Bell franchise king Sean Tuohy (solid Tim McGraw). She has two kids, daughter Collins (smart and pretty Lily Collins) and son S.J. (scene stealing Jae Head). Collins is a volleyball star and cheerleader. S.J. is the precocious kid with his finger in everything. Leigh Anne is an interior designer, who often lunches on $18 salads with her lady friends. Her life changes when she chooses to take hulking Big Mike (Aaron) into the family. Director Hancock punctuates family throughout the movie. Early on Big Mike tells Leigh Anne that he doesn't like being called ""Big Mike"". Leigh Anne obliges, ""I'll call you Michael."" And when they shop for clothes in his old neighborhood, Michael reminds Leigh Anne, ""I got your back.""This is the amazing and endearing thread of ""The Blind Side""—it's about protecting your own, protecting family. At the narrative arc Bullock fearlessly stares down a street thug, ""You threaten my son! You threaten me!"" In another great scene, Leigh Anne storms onto the football practice field, and instructs Michael how to play the game. She says, ""This team is your family Are you going to protect the family, Michael?""The soul of ""The Blind Side"" is Bullock and her touching relationship with Michael authentically played by Quinton Aaron. Aaron is deceptively expressive and strong. He movingly narrates his essay that the only thing that matters is honor. At the story arc, Michael tells Leigh Anne, ""Don't you dare lie to me!"" Really this is Bullock's movie. She amazes throughout with her spirit, compassion, and her powerful silence. When Leigh Anne makes up Michael's room, he tells her that he never had a bed before. Bullock walks to her room, and sits on her bed in solace. When Michael's crack addicted Mother tells Leigh Anne that she doesn't want Michael to see her the way she is, Bullock sits next to her and holds her hand in silence. And we are in awe as well.Everyone is amazing in ""The Blind Side"". Lily Collins as Collins ditches her girlfriends to keep company with Michael in the school library. She confides, ""It's like were studying together at home."" Jae Head S.J. is simply awesome when he asks the recruiting Coaches, ""So what's in it for me?"" Tim McGraw is solidly understated when Leigh Anne asks him, ""Am I a good person?"" Kathy Bates rules as Michael's tutor Miss Sue.The only goofy narrative twist involves NCAA Investigator Granger (in your face Sharon Morris). Granted this seems like a plot device, because we kind of know how this true story goes. This is a minor distraction, because at the core of ""The Blind Side"" is family, honor, and unconditional love. There is such a great moment when Michael tells Leigh Anne, ""You need to give me a proper hug."" ""The Blind Side"" just touches your soul.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

One Heart Warming Story.,"I would recommend this movie to anyone I see. It has so many great aspects that we all can take into account with our day to day lives. With the family being so accepting, loving, and open to this boy loving him enough to eventually adopt him. We could learn a few things from this family ourselves. ""The Blind Side"" teaches us not only to love others and treat them like we would like to be treated but also not to judge a person before we know them. The person could be one amazing person just afraid to shine and show their true colors right away. I leave you with this, if you saw a peer of your child walking home in the late evening would you stop to make sure he/she is alright and has a place to stay for the night? That is what this family did.",,Anonymous,Biography

Worked for me,"I saw ""The blind side"" last Saturday. I guess you already know the plot: black boy with problems and no home is hosted in a white rich family house, where is going to stay and change his life forever. It's the typical story of ""fall and redemption"". If we talk about cinematographic features, it's cheesy. The movie is full of clichés: Michale Oher (the black boy) is extremely, extremely nice, even having had a terrible life. He has no sequels. The Tuohyes are all mature and grown up people, even the teenage daughter Collins has no problems with the fact of living with a big black boy in the same house without having any complain about what her friends would say. The son S.J., starts starts referring to Oher as his ""brother"" whit no spark of jealous. Mamma is always armed, and has no fear of getting in the ghetto to look for his boy. So, we are in presence of the celebration of perfect life but we do know, that life is far away from being perfect. Seems too much, even for Hollywood. But...there is always a but. For some reasons, the movie worked for me. Maybe because when I saw Quinton Aaron's smiling I believed him. Made me believe that was a guardian of his family, I found him refreshing and credible. And when he was frowning, he was showing the world the pain in his heart. Aaron composed a character that you can love and embrace as a son or as a brother. And then there is Sandra Bullock. I must say that in my opinion, his career is comprised of both good and bad performances. But she knows what she has. Bullock, who portrays Leigh Anne Tuohy, is shown in the film extremely stylish. But she also composes a character with strong determination to make difficult decisions. She may make those decisions too easily, but the director balanced that simplification with great close-up shots of Bullock's beautiful expressions. She knows how to do it. And then finally, there is the dedication of Leigh Anne Tuohy as a mother. You can not help but stifle a sob when Oher call ""mama"" for the first time to Bullock in the movie. It's the universal theme: the call of motherhood, the relation between a son and his mother, even when one is black, and the other is white.The whole thing is around Leigh Anne and Oher. And that's it. The other actors are only good details in the drama. And worked for me. For no reasons, and for all reasons. Maybe because we love thinking that, at least in the movies, life is perfect.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Inspirational and uplifting.,"I have no interest in football - or any other sport for that matter. This was a big disadvantage for the movie before I even started reviewing it. Being based on fact helped even less, as I expected a tedious sports movie. The only draw card for me - sort of - was Sandra Bullock.Well, 'The Blind Side' proved me wrong! I ended up loving this movie! I was never bored, and the film had my full attention from beginning to end. It was also a lot funnier than expected. (No, it's not a comedy but there are a few very funny moments).Sandra Bullock stars as Leigh Anne Tuohy, a successful interior designer. Her husband is Sean Tuohy, who owns a few restaurant franchises. Their children are Collins and S. J (or Sean jr.), who go to Briarcrest Christian School, where Michael Oher (or Big Mike) has just been enrolled - against the better judgment of the school staff, believing him to be academically challenged.Michael is a gentle giant who doesn't talk much, and doesn't mingle with the other students - or rather, they have no interest in mingling with him. One night Leigh Anne takes pity on Michael when she sees him walking in the cold and rain. The family takes him to their home, and having nowhere else to go, Michael soon becomes a part of the family. Michael would eventually find his love for football - in part also thanks to Leigh Anne, who motivated him.'The Blind Side' is an inspirational, uplifting, compassionate and humanitarian film with a strong message. I never thought I would enjoy the movie as much as I did. The performances from the entire cast was very good. 13-Year old Jae Head was awesome as S. J. Quinton Aaron also delivered a moving performance as Michael. I thought Sandra Bullock also did a fantastic job in a serious role. 'The Blind Side' was a pleasant surprise.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just... Yikes,"Back in 2009, when I first saw this movie (probably on some sorta field trip), I didn't really think much of it. Anything that is associated around sports I am not interested in. This apathy extends to movies as well, so when I first watched the Blind Side, I thought it was just... fine. The acting of course really was well done, Sandra Bullock and Quiton Aaron hit out it of the park, but even then this movie is pretty forgettable and largely schmaltzy oscarbait. So back then I would've given it a 6/10. Emphasis on *back then.*Nowadays...yikes. Recent revelations regarding Michael Oher and the relationship with his surrogate family have re-contextualized the Blind Side and for the worst. Making the Blind Side one of the most stunning depictions of aging poorly. As it turns out, the Tuohy family, the ones who looked after Michael, did not adopt Michael Oher. Rather he was tricked into a conservatorship agreement, which allocated all money to his guardians, and not to him. Money made through the NFL? To the Tuohys. Advertising? The Tuohys. Even the box office numbers of a movie all about Michael Oher, not a single cent to the actual eponymous football player. A stark contrast to the film's version of an earnest family of the ""Selfless Southerners"" cliche.Which finally leads to the film's second most poorly aged aspect: the depictions. This movie simplifies and scrubs a lot of nuisances and filled this world with cardboard cutouts. It is uncomfortable in how the Tuohys are portrayed as white saviors whilst Michael Oher is portrayed as a cliched, 2-dimensional gentle giant who portrayed as ""dumb."" When that isn't the case. A potentially interesting story about Michael beating the odds of a troubled early life of poverty, foster care and poor grades to become a NFL legend has been usurped by a middle-class white savior saving a downtrodden minor. Sadly ironic how that reflects reality.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Awesome movie,"The Blind Side is one of the most inspiring movies of all time. However, I feel like that that movie should have done better in the box office. Based on a true story, current NFL player Michael Ore has had a rough life since childhood before getting drafted by the Baltimore Ravens. He was taken by the state from his mother at a very young age and had nowhere to go until a family adopted him and got him to get a football scholarship to the University of Mississippi. They gave him everything he needed like a tutor for school, a truck, a place to live, even his own room that he never had anything like one before. This movie shows that even if you had a very rough childhood, you can still make the best out of life because of it. Even though the movie did do well by receiving over $255 million, it could have still done better, especially if it's based on a true story. The one star that really shines out in the movie is Sandra Bullock, who plays as the mother of the family that adopted Michael. Sandra Bullock has always done great movies, but I believe that ""The Blind Side"" is by far her greatest movie yet just because of how she acts like it was really happening in real life.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"love is blind, spirit is not","Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for her role as Leigh Anne Tuohy, who took the destitute Michael Oher under her wing. I certainly found ""The Blind Side"" to be worth seeing. Maybe not the ultimate masterpiece, but it is one that I would recommend. Criticism that I read about the movie is that it depicts a white family heroically helping an African-American. Well, even if that is the case, it's still an important story.Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) grew up in foster homes in Memphis, always running away. When he got sent to a Christian school, he met Sean, whose mother Leigh Anne allowed him to stay in the house. On the tests, Michael scores in the 98th percentile in protective instincts, and it's clear that football is his talent. But both Michael and Leigh Anne still have issues to deal with on both their sides of the tracks.While the film does have its weaknesses, I still wish to assert that everyone should see this. Not just because it's a true story. Hell, I'm not even going for the whole ""triumph of the human spirit"" routine. I think that the most important thing portrayed in ""The Blind Side"" is the current state of race relations in the United States, and how each side has to deal with its own stereotypes. So definitely see it.Also starring Tim McGraw and Kathy Bates.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Excellent Family Film for the Xmas Season, Go Sandra, Go!","Another lovely family seen on DVD during the festive season. For a Brit living in south east Asia most of the time, I think a narrative caption explaining to a non-American and non-enthusiast of US football who is lawrence Taylor - would have been appreciated, opening scene of the football match didn't do it for me I am afraid and was the weakest part of the film.I loved this film, similar for me like Juno and yes, it has Oscar potential. Sandra Bullock was average in The proposal and disappointing in All About Steve, this was her at her best and clearly she must have some enthusiasm for US football - but what with this Tennessee/Mississippi thing? Can someone please explain.Big Mike was great. Nice simple story in essence of an affluent American family doing a good turn for a homeless coloured kid; the football element I think was secondary to the social integration which Big Mike was trying to experience at school and in the new family home. Even his real Mum in her short role was a star.Does an American football player really have to have brains to progress his career? God help some of the English soccer players if there was ever such a requirement applied by the British FA! Did wonder what the husband did all day with his work/business to be sop affluent and allow Sandra bullock carte-blanche pretty much on running her family life and other peoples as well. Thought the children characters in the movie were a little stiff and unimpressive but this was really a film vehicle for Sandra bullock to really excel, she dominated this film much more than big Mike.OK, I finally got to understand about The Blind Side as part of the football game but as I said, i thought football was secondary in this films. It was well directed, overall well acted and it is quirky comedy which will make you happy at the cinema or on DVD",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Feel-good, entertaining and thought-provoking","First and foremost a note for doubting parents- disregard the PG-13 rated. There are made 5 words and a total of 2 minutes of material that gave it that rating. I think it is suitable for anyone 10+ and I strongly suggest you go as a family.I wanted to see this movie the first time I saw the trailer because I'm a sucker for a good underdog story and my Dad filled me in on Michael Oher. I can say point blank it was so moving that I'm still thinking about it two days later. It did a wonderful job of show casing a blessed family, blessing someone in need and changing as people along the way. I was very pleased with how well they handled the Christian ideal throughout the film so that it was clear what the Touhys morals were, yet not being preachy. I adored Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne because when I looked at her I saw my mom in every possible way... A tough cookie on the outside, but soft as snow on the inside. The young actor that played SJ captured my heart because he was so pure and sincere about everything he did. I had just wrapped up a series at my church about how it is important to remember the ways you are blessed and find ways to bless others in need so the movie fit right in with that.

What a Piece of Crap,"I walked into this movie with high hopes. After seeing a wave of violent, depressing movies, (Precious, Hurt Locker, to name a couple) I was finally ready to see an insightful, uplifting, intelligent movie.I was terribly disappointed.The Blind Side was not only bad, it was offensive. It is full of melodrama, stupid clichés and unrealistic events.Take the scene where Leigh Anne is looking for Michael and she is talking to the guys Michael just had a fight with, and she say, ""You listen to me, bitch,"" and then goes off on an angry rant, and the guys just sit there and seem scared.Yeah, right.Another problem with the film is the way it treats black people.

Bullock Makes Her Mark as a Steel-Willed Memphis Belle in an Emotionally Driven Football Drama,"This empathetic 2009 sports-oriented drama is what professional critics would call an uplift film, unabashed in pulling all the necessary emotional cords with an undemanding audience. Screenwriter/director John Lee Hancock is no stranger to the genre since his last two films reflected similar against-all-odds story lines, the Texan band of brothers in ""The Alamo"" and the over-the-hill pitcher in ""The Rookie"". However, there are two key factors that transcend the potentially manipulative structure of Hancock's adaptation of Michael Lewis' intriguing 2006 fact-based book about the evolution of the left tackle in pro football. The first is the irresistible pull of the true-life story of six-foot-six, 345-pound Michael Oher, plucked out of destitution in the Memphis projects by a well-to-do white family to become the starting left tackle at Ole Miss and now with the Baltimore Ravens. The second is Sandra Bullock, bleached blonde, immensely likable, and heavily into no-bull ""Erin Brockovich"" terrain, in a solid performance as Leigh Ann Touhy, the feisty decorator wife and mother who takes Oher into her family home.The film begins when the coach of a private religious school sees the otherwise lumbering Michael display natural athletic ability on the basketball court. The coach sees untapped potential in Michael as a football player because of his huge size, so much so that he gets accepted despite his poor academic record. It also turns out that the taciturn Michael, referred to by everyone as ""Big Mike"", is homeless, sleeping wherever he can since the state took him away as a child from his crack-addicted mother. The upscale Touhys have noticed him before since he goes to school with their children, S.J. and Collins, but it isn't until they see Michael wandering in the freezing cold that Leigh Anne impulsively takes him in. Despite some initial hesitation, he quickly becomes a part of the family, and his performance at school improves enough for him to show what he can do on the football field. Once Leigh Ann crystallizes the team-as-family metaphor for Michael, the 345-pound behemoth starts to realize his talent for smashing the defensive line. College football coaches from throughout the South come to the Touhy home to recruit Michael aggressively to play for them. Ole Miss is the Touhys' alma mater, which leads to an unexpected but inevitable dramatic turn.It's not that Bullock does anything all that new in the movie. Rather, it's that she leverages her winning, every-person screen persona so very well within a character that would seem antithetical to her sensibilities as an actress. While it's true that the story probably puts too much emphasis on her character's role in Michael's ascent, Bullock is one of the few film stars today that can generate such an instant rapport with her audience, and she carries the emotional weight of the story with grit and dexterity. As Michael, Quinton Aaron has to be such an impassive presence at the beginning that when he starts to form into his own person, the actor brings a gentle, palpable force to his character's evolution. It's really the scenes between Bullock and Aaron that tug most at the heartstrings (I welled up at least three times during those shrewdly engineered moments). On the sidelines, country singer Tim McGraw plays supportive husband Sean credibly, and there are scene-stealing turns from towheaded Jae Head as the indefatigable S.J. and Kathy Bates in her usual gutsy-broad form as Michael's tutor, Miss Sue. Broadway actress Adriane Lenox - who originated the role of Mrs. Miller in ""Doubt"" - provides the film's most heartbreaking moments as Michael's haunted mother. This is far less a sports movie and more of a story of individual need and the power of family. The film is powerful in that respect.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful movie,"I had not seen this movie in a long time, and I saw it on television last night. It is an incredible story and very well done movie. I think Sandra Bullock is great in it, as is the rest of the cast. You really felt like you were watching the actual family while tuning into the movie thanks largely to Bullock's performance. While I was watching it this time, I searched around online to see how much of it is true and it is surprisingly accurate. Some of the subjects quibble with some of the details, but less than in most true stories. The family is all still very close today in fact, which put a smile on my face.I just think the story is so fantastic and inspirational that it is worth everyone watching, children or adult. The story of how the family helped Oher and at the same time Oher united the entire family is touching to say the least.",,Anonymous,Biography
Sweet Without Being Maudlin,"I have always disliked Sandra Bullock with ""dislike"" being the most polite word I can come up with among the rather ample stable of pejoratives that come to mind when looking over her past work. Add to this the fact that I'm almost embarrassed to glow over this type of movie which is like a glorified after-school special. I read a few reviews on IMDb of the film before I watched it and something someone said sort of stuck and I had an altered approach to the viewing. The Blind Side is almost relentlessly upbeat and Pollyannaish. You could say the same thing about The Beatles ""All You Need is Love"" and not many people mock that song. They director manages to be unmercifully sweet without it every being corny or maudlin. It helps when whatever message you have decided to deliver is served with a heavy dose of humor. You can get away with a lot of sermonizing if you disguise it with a few jokes.What struck me about the movie, and something I thoroughly appreciated, was that race wasn't anywhere near the biggest issue. I would also rate this film as more of a comedy than a sports movie or anything else. It was truly funny.I'm sure that this movie has zero to do with the actual events of the lives of the people it claims to represent but it's a damn movie, people. If this movie wasn't political enough for you, or you thought that it condescended to the adopted black boy and that he served as basically a family pet then perhaps you should remember that this wasn't intended as a documentary. It's a movie, folks.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Feel good,You don't have to be a football fan to enjoy this story of helping others. Its competent for what it is.Bullock is good. She does not overact. Lucky it wasn't a heavy competition year or she might not have won for this role which didn't require that much acting.The movie avoids sentimentality. The only thing is the saintliness of Leigh Ann and her family is almost hard to swallow. Maybe it should have shown some more of the difficulties of the family's acceptance of the adoption to be more balanced.The actor who plays Michael seems a bit impassive. I guess it was deliberate.Worth watching once.,7.0,Anonymous,Biography
far from blind,"I was a hater. I went into this film with the lowest of expectations. I expected a one sided, melodramatic, lifetime movie with an odd looking badly cast Sandra Bullock at the films center. Boring, unnecessary and too silly to take serious. well I'm happy to say that I was so wrong. I had heard good things about this film and they were hard to believe but they were all true. The true story on screen here is inspiring and heart warming. The film is handled with a genuine sincerity and never falls into melodrama instead touching and than avoiding only to further the films complex and unique story line. With themes of racism, class, love, fear and courage among many others. The blind Side handles them all with a soft ease making for a wonderful experience. it's intelligent and objective with a truly moving performance from Sandra Bullock the best of her career. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll love this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Christian blockbuster,"With a gross of over $290 Million, The Blind Side made 10 times it profit from it's budget $29 Million. It became one of the most successful sports films ever and appealed to new cinema crowd, the Bible-belt, middle America crowd.The Blind Side tells the story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a poor African-American teenager from Memphis whom mum was drug-addict and he slept on the sofa of a family friend. He was enrolled into a private Christian School, with the promise that he could make a good American football player, but lacks the academic ability. After being kicked out from the projects, Michael is taken in by Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) and her family. They give him a home and adopt the man out of Christian charity. When Michael's grades pick up and he shows his skills as a player some top universities show interest in giving him a scholarship: but he still needs to raises his grades to ensure he can get into university.The main reason why The Blind Side succeeded with the Christian crowd was because it shows a Republican, Christian family in a positive light. They were shown as a family who took in Michael because it was they Christian ideal of charity (the better aspects of Christianity). Bullock plays Leigh Anne as a hard-as-nails, tough mother, protecting her family and is shown as a more liberal minded Republican. This was a film that also shows how rich white suburban community are completely segregated from the poor inner-city, predominately black areas, with two different cultures. The acting in the film was decent, with Bullock being the stand out performers, winning herself her first Oscar. Whilst her performance is good showing herself to feisty, yet funny, it was not the best of the year: I think Saoirse Ronan was the best performer in her role in The Lovely Bones. Aaron was decent as the gently giant, a person who is shy but has an inter-depth: but his character is a cliché.John Lee Hancock writes and directs this film. Whilst the direction is decent, pretty standard with this type of film, The Blind Side follows a typical formula, with Michael improving his grades, starting out in American Football, improving at American Football, attempting to get into university and a final ordeal. There are montage scenes and some elements of the film felt similar to previous American Football films like We Are Marshall and Friday Night Lights, where the team starts out poorly but quickly improve. But Hancock knows what he is doing, he does not try to be too adventurous with his direction and works well with the standard formula.The film has been met with criticism that it took the charity of a white family to allow a black person to succeed: but that was the nature of the story, there was not a lot Hancock could have done. It should be more a commentary on the situation. There was of course the theme of Christian charity in the film, but this was done one a individual level. But a problem with the film was that Michael Oher was basically a secondary character in his own film, playing second fiddle to Sandra Bullock. Whilst the film could be seen as a criticism of the state education system, where there is a lack of funding and teachers did not care. This is of course a problem with schools that are in poor inner-city areas that affect schools in many country. And that a student could improve in a private system. The message is dodgy, but there is a valid point. But a more worrying aspect of the film is the treatment of black characters. In the film there are either gang members, drug addicts or militant activists. There is no character that would be more grounded and realistic. Even Michael was shown to be stereotypical as the gentle giant who was not very academic.Overall it is what it is and a decent film for it. But it was not worthy of a best picture nod.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The movie is a scam,"When this film came out, I believed its feel good story about how this family supposedly did good deeds. What really happened is that Michael Oher was never adopted by Leigh Ann and Sean Tuohy. Instead what the Tuohys did was to trick Michael into signing conservatorship papers which allowed the Tuohys and their children to profit off of Michael's story.Only years later, with the help of a lawyer, was Michael able to learn the truth. The Tuohys and their children received payments of tens of thousands of dollars from the Blind Side film while Michael was paid nothing.I almost never give a movie a 1 star rating.

This movie was therefore, the biggest surprise. I was expecting much less because the ending is already known and the plot seems to tell it all.BUT I WAS SO WRONG!

"Not Quite a Touchdown, but it's in the Red Zone","The juggernauts of gridiron cinema—such as Rudy and Remember the Titans— almost all have one thing in common: they're unapologetically formulaic, but they're also extraordinarily well done. Sports movies of one variety or another are produced every year, but it's rare that any of them really leave a lasting impression on the collective American consciousness. More often than not, they're nothing more than exercises in the art of telling the classic inspiration story; you know, the faithful underdog overcoming crushing odds (think ""David and Goliath""). In Rudy, it was all about a runt with larger-than-life aspirations. In John Lee Hancock's The Blind Side, it's all about a larger-than-life (literally) teen who just wants a bed he can call his own. He's not thinking about what will happen years down the road; he's only thinking about where he'll find his next meal.It's based on the true story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a down- and-out Memphis teen who regularly wanders in and out of foster homes. His mother is a coke-fiend, and he has no family to watch after him. However, thanks to the generosity of a friend, he's introduced to the football coach of a private Christian school and is admitted on the basis of his formidable athletic presence. Michael still has no home, however; he picks up half-eaten bags of popcorn at his school's gym after volleyball games so he's able to eat. He spends his evenings keeping warm inside a local laundromat.One night, Leigh Anne Tuohy, the wife of a wealthy fast-food entrepreneur, sees him walking the streets and brings him home. Her family provides him with new clothing and a bed of his own. All of this happens so quickly, in fact, that my first instinct was to say, ""Wow— this would never happen."" The whole setup, in fact, seems so naively optimistic that it screams Hollywood contrivance. However, there's one catch to all this that's easy to forget: like the previously mentioned Rudy, it's a true story. As such, the movie has, to a certain degree, some wiggle room in terms of exploring scenarios that would otherwise reverberate as totally unrealistic or totally clichéd. I suppose, however, that clichés sometimes receive their namesake because they are, in fact, reality for so many people.To my surprise, this fact actually causes The Blind Side to excel where other movies might've fizzled. The whole thing—though often derivative— feels very ""matter-of-fact."" The deeper into the story you go, the more genuine it feels. Wisely, Hancock has chosen to spin his tale by letting the actors and a steady camera do the work. There are no overly dramatic camera angles, and the soundtrack is minimal. The dialogue is a little over-the-top at times, but it's not so much that's distracting. Really, what we get here are a lot of unadorned scenes that depict our protagonist going about his daily activities, merely trying to survive. The 128-minute runtime does start to wear a little thin as things come to a close, but it's hard to imagine much of the story being cut. I guess that's one of the difficulties of telling a ""true story"": it's often hard to know what is essential and what's extracurricular.What really stands out in The Blind Side, however, is its penchant for probing the social class divide that so many Americans either ignore or pretend doesn't exist. Despite its references to Norman Rockwell and the plight of the working poor, I'm not quite ready to heap unconditional praise on the movie. It's exploration of these concepts is far from subtle, and is often presented in such a way as to almost shout, ""Hey, stupid! Do something about this!"" It's not that I question the film's call to action, it's just that its presentation is like a brick to the forehead. We're bombarded with images of dirty apartments, broken homes, and life ""on the other side of the tracks."" My hope was that the movie's early use of flashback would get this particular job done in a much more subtle way, but Hancock and co. decided to take a more blunt approach that, in my estimation, takes a little something away from the overall ""bite.""So, what are my final thoughts on The Blind Side?It's frequently gooey and predictable. At times its unabashed desire to make you blubber like an infant will be infuriating. Oddly enough, though, it's also very genuine, and no one can deny the inherent truth of its many messages.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
inspiring story with good performances,"This happens to be my first. I was reading through some of the reviews here. Most of them had judged this through the wrong lens. Normally I don't care, but this movie deserves better. A ""sports movie""?? C'mon!!. This is bigger than that. Someone also talks about white and black.Well, for me, I being an Indian not familiar with the American football or the black and white stuff, this was one of those which had a lot of warmth to it. Please see this without prior notions...This is a simple story, or would have been one, if it was not a true event. A simpleton, who don't keep a grudge on anybody or anything, happen to meet a great family, pure luck, and his life is changed forever. Forget football, forget being black and/or white guilts, savor this one. You will feel that genuine warmth that seeps through in each character and if that's half what actually happened in that big family, the director deserves a standing ovation. It is easy to depict people's feelings using apt dialogues, but the main character in the movie rarely talks. Even then we get to see how he is a changed person, not by his grades, not by his football, but by that simple ""Big Mike smile"" he begin to put on when he is accepted as one of the family. And that gets through even to the sister. Watch it for those moments where you will feel for him, for the genuine concerns of the mother and that little brother. If you ever felt being loved by someone, this movie will fill your heart. And do appreciate those wonderful performances, Sandra Bullock shows why she's highly rated. watch it like you read a story..you'll love this. I just did.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Why do people like this movie?,"I am absolutely shocked.....and not in a good way. Has American cinema fallen so far that we can consider this monstrosity even an ""average"" movie at best? The story was utterly predictable and failed to instill any sense of surprise in any moments. From the first twenty minutes, you could predict the course of the plot if you'd seen any kind of ""inspirational"" sports movie. The characters were no better. Tim Mcgraw faded into the wallpaper about a third of the way through the movie, and I was about ready to hurl a brick at my TV just so I could pretend I was throwing a real one at SJ. The character of Michael Oher seemed like a baby made from the genes of Forrest Gump and John Coffey, with a touch of Radio, but I'll give the actor pity points for effort. My greatest contempt, however, goes towards Sandra Bullock. I honestly think she did a better job in ""All About Steve"". She seems like an amalgamation of the ""rough on the players cuz I love 'em"" coaches you see in every other generic sports movie, only with estrogen and a TERRIBLY faked southern accent. I was shocked when they chose her for the Oscar over Gabourey Sidibe, who, unlike Bullock, seems to know one or two things about ACTING.

The movie was great.,The Blind Side was a great movie. I love how the story plot leads into the feelings of the characters. All I want to know is how did Mike leave the one guy who got him into the school? The movie never explains that for the viewers. They also didn't mention he was good in basketball. How many times do you see some big teenager walking around homeless? The movie is giving us a message that we need to have hospitality. Without that we are not caring. If you don't care for others you don't care for yourself. The family helps Mike academically and physically. SJ is a very funny child who loves attention. Would you put your life in danger for someone you love ? Mike was so good in football that he made it to the All-American team. Then he was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An overrated feel-good movie with an overrated Oscar,"""The Blind Side"" is a decent movie about some decent people who gave a decent young man a chance at life. Unfortunately, that's about as exciting as it gets. As a feel-good movie, it pales in comparison to many other films I would place in the same category. Take ""October Sky"" as an example. It has many similarities to ""The Blind Side."" Both are about a teen-ager who has had little encouragement in his life and an adult who sees potential and nurtures it. Both have positive outcomes. And both are based on true stories. But ""October Sky"" gave us a much more compelling story and kept us more emotionally involved. The fault may lie partly on the subject matter, but I believe there it more to it than that. I, for one, believe Sandra Bullock's Oscar was one of the least deserved in recent history. I may be no drama expert, like some who are on the message board claim to be, but to me her performance was uninspired. All in all, much of the time while I was watching the movie it seemed like something I'd seen a million times on the Hallmark Hall of Fame channel or a Lifetime movie of the week.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Blind Side was a compellingly filmed version of the true story of Michael Oher and Leigh Anne Touhy,"Whenever my movie theatre working friend sees a trailer of an upcoming film and likes what he sees, he always says, ""That's going to be good."" He said that when we watched the preview ad for this one and when he does that, I sometimes have a skeptical mind about it since I don't always share his tastes in entertainment (his favorite form of such is pro wrestling of which I can do without). Such it was for this movie especially when the new critics of ""At the Movies"", Michael Phillips and A. O. Scott, both gave good reasons for saying, ""Skip it."" But while it seemed to be more about Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) and her family than it seemed to be about Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) and his background, that's only because we don't find out about his past until later on. And I did disagree a bit with Phillips and Scott about not seeing Ms. Tuohy actually mean it when she says to her lady friends, ""I'm learning from him."" She seems to be the smartest one in the whole picture with the way she convinces nearly everyone to her point of view. Oh, and as an Independent, I can appreciate the different ways a conservative, religious, and wealthy family can seem so compassionate toward both a poor, seemingly mentally slow, African-American teenager and a Democratic, possibly liberal, tutor (Kathy Bates). In fact, there was quite a funny line about that and one toward former president George W. Bush at a motor vehicle place where Michael was trying to get a driver's license. It wasn't a nasty one though, so I don't think anyone should be offended. What really impressed me, however, was Michael's turning point after having doubts about his choice of college seemingly based on his adopted family's history there-not to mention his trip back to his former neighborhood in which he sees how wasted his former ""friends"" truly are-and really sticking up for himself about why he made that choice. So, fine performances on both Ms. Bullock and Mr. Aaron's behalf, and good ones on the rest of the cast's especially that of Ms. Bates. Okay, maybe not so much on the actual university coaches' scenes especially that of former LSU coach Nick Saban who's on the longest (though if he was still with the Tigers and not at rival Alabama, I might be a little more lenient, LOL). But with all that I've said, I highly recommend The Blind Side.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Blind Side tells the story of good old fashioned Christian charity.,"The Blind Side tells the story of good old fashioned Christian charity. In an age where charity is defined by its tax exemption, where giving of money is a poor substitute for giving of self, Christmastime is the right time for the feel-good movie of the year.And that is what you have here... a big-budget feel good movie of the year. Will it challenge the way you think? Probably not. Will you learn something new? No. Will you be able to identify cliché conventions for telling a story?

nothing to really get too worked up about - not even Bullock can elevate it past its 'safe' quarters,"I'm sure Michael Oher is an inspiring sort of story. In fact his real story, the one glossed over in the film version The Blind Side, is kind of fascinating (unlike in the film, Oher was taken by several families over the years, some black, until winding up with the Twohey's as seen here). That he could make a difference, if only for himself, is a fine feat. But there's something about the movie that is sanitized, kept in the Hollywood bakery to make it fresh for a G-rated mass consumption. It's not even offensive to any great degree, except for the fact that the filmmakers relegate the main character to a secondary kind of role (rather, if he does have any real personality in real life, it's whittled down to make him a cypher, a character that does what he's told and never questions anything - not even why he becomes a football star).Oh, it has its moments. And Sandra Bullock has that feisty kind of 'All-American-Woman' spirit, the kind that wins Oscars (you know the kind, re: Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich). And her acclaim for the role isn't unearned as she puts a lot of passion and personality into the part, at least as much as the script allows. And Kathy Bates has an amusing if bizarre cameo as the lone DEMOCRAT of the piece (something she mentions like she's sad to be Satan coming through the door). But it's the character of Oher, and the actor playing him, that brings the film down. The film itself has its conventional pleasures and beats, but I couldn't help but feeling they left Oher out to dry, like a symbol of something for white people to rally around. Again, it's never too offensive, and its heart is in the right place (think of it, perhaps, as a sign of burgeoning White Conservative Guilt peeking out as opposed to garden-variety liberal kind).Yet characters outside of Oher don't bring much to the table either. I would've liked to have seen some other personality come out from, say, the high school football coach, or understand more about where Oher came from aside from the usual 'oh, it's a bad ghetto' thing. It's ultimately neither too stirring as a human saga nor as a sports triumph, but just run of the mill. And yet for another audience, children, it's a fine little piece of fluff (tell me the director wasn't thinking of a children audience during those plucky scenes where the little boy acts like an agent for Oher in front of the college recruiters).",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very well done and heartwarming,"I would not be surprised if ""The Blind Side"" and Sandra Bullock are nominated for Best Picture and Best Actress '09. It's a most unusual story of how some of us really do take their Christian faith and obligations seriously instead of how many false money-grabbing prophets and faith healers inundate us all.

She is so consistently good in her movies, even if some of the movies are poor, that it's time she had an Oscar anyway. It was amusing she had a Raspberry at the same time but so what? I'm looking forward to seeing All About Steve too - our local cinema pulled it because they had ""too many other movies to show and it was a turkey,"" they said. I said I'd have liked the chance to find out, thanks, and I don't believe anything Bullock does can be that bad....She took that Raspberry with her usual good humour and charm, what could do better than that to promote it?I don't have a lot to say about the story of Blind Side because everyone's said it already. It's a wonderful, heartwarming, feel-good movie. So nice to see Bullock in a ""normal marriage situation"" instead of struggling with a nasty husband/partner who doesn't appreciate her or treats her like dirt as is the case in some of her movies. Beyond that, it's all about the talented but neglected boy who needs love and help and my how he repays it big time.

Generic Story with Feel-Good Theme,"The Blind Side tells the story of the young Michael Oher, an underprivileged kid saved and adopted by the Tuohy family and, by their support, becomes a football player.The general theme and story are of a generic feel-good movie. So, for the correct audience, The Blind Side is filled with happy and emotional moments that lift your spirit. However, in some parts, the movie goes far with this and becomes similar to a cheap comedy. As a case in point, the moments with the little brother, while being funny, are exaggerated and not believable enough. Furthermore, the third act seems strange and out of place as it has no actual connection with the rest of the movie.The acting of Sandra Bullock and the casting of Quinton Aaron are the main strengths of the movie. Sandra Bullock gives an outstanding performance of a kind, loving, and confident woman and a mother. Unfortunately, while Bullock's acting is enjoyable, the performance of other actors seems a bit bland that probably stems from their poor dialogues. Given that, the actor of the main character, played by Quinton Aaron, has the perfect face, posture, and expressions for the movie, which makes you genuinely care about and love his character. To give some examples, I loved scenes where he is doubtfully staring at someone or blurts out the words ""I don't know!"".In conclusion, if you are feeling low and need an emotional boost, this movie is satisfying; however, I would not recommend it for a having gratifying cinema experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Surprisingly Good,"This movie belongs to Sandra Bullock, who I will admit, I dislike as an actress. I think in movies generally the RomCom genre she usually appears in, makes her roles tired, and she often appears tired in those movies. When she has done serious, she always appears to me to lack the chops to make the roles believable or real. This is different. This movie starts off with characters, and builds them. Remember when films used to require a script, and acting...well ""The Blind Side"" is that kind of movie. Sandra Bullock is astonishing (not sure if it is her, or my generally low expectations for her) but she takes the role and makes it her own. I am not American and have no idea about American Football, but that is not the core of the story.The heart of the story is a family that opens their home to a boy who seems to have nothing, but of course has so much...it just requires getting over petty stereotypes. It could have fallen into cliché, and there were moments when it teetered on the verge, but it always managed to stay on the rails. The support cast is outstanding, and altogether it is a positive and uplifting film without being cloying or chocolate box. For someone who had low expectations, take it from me, this one is worth the time and money. Sandra Bullock deserves her Golden Globes nomination for this movie although having been nominated for ""The Proposal"" as well might take some of the sheen off this gem.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sort of beat my expectations,"I wasn't expecting much from this film, basically cause I ain't really into this types of genre nor am I into sport or care for it. So I wasn't excited to go see it when I saw the trailers, but too my surprise it kept my attention most of the way through and was a lot better than I thought it would be. The plot is basically about this big black guy named Micheal Oher who had no future in life, getting a second chance when he get adopted into a rich white family. And he is like a big harmless teddy bear and he takes advantage of his size to get accepted into good schools and making a career out of playing football. This was a touching film that is most definitely worth checking out and a good family film although it's actually quite profitable.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"'I haven't changed your life, you've changed mine.'","BLIND SIDE is a quiet little film, one of the type we usually see on Hallmark Hall of Fame on television, that carries a tender message without really offending anyone or challenging the mentality of the viewer. It just happens to be based on a book by Michael Lewis who in turn based his writing on a true story 'the story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized boy ho became an All American football player and first round NFL draft pick with the help of a caring woman and her family.' John Lee Hancock adapted the novel for the screen and directed it. He scored a hit when he decided to cast Sandra Bullock as the brave society no nonsense mother Leigh Anne Tuohy, giving Bullock the opportunity to polish her acting chops to a fare-thee-well. Tim McGraw is very strong as the husband/father Sean Tuohy and the two young actors who play the biological Tuohy children - Jae Head and Lily Collins - are equal to their 'parents' performances. Quinton Aaron is the quiet pacifist Michael Oher who is taken into the household of a Southern family as an equal in Memphis Tennessee where racial bias still exists. It is the transformation of Michael as well as the florid transformation of the Tuohy family (especially the brilliantly realized Leigh Anne) that makes this little film glow. Kathy Bates makes a brief cameo as a tutor for Michael and Ray McKinnon makes his role as the coach credible. And the rest of the cast offer of a very high quality of support.BLIND SIDE is not a great movie, just as 'PRECIOUS etc etc etc' is not a great movie: at the core of both of these films are the moments of light that enter the lives a unfortunate youngsters who then radiate the lives of those who have the courage to believe in the equality of mankind. They deserve our attention.Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Diff'rent Strokes, Part Deux","It takes a lot of courage for filmmakers to show the daily struggles of rich, white, good-looking Republicans in the South. And it takes a lot of courage for rich, white, good-looking Southern Republicans to imagine that a large, young African American man might just have the potential to be a football star. And it takes the most courage of all to show a story where issues of race and class in the USA are key issues, and yet totally ignore the economic and political constructs which continue to disenfranchise certain races and economic classes.Thank goodness for the can-do attitude of a Southern MILF! Thank goodness for a mansion and million$ made from fast-food restaurants...thank goodness for the poor and ethnic minorities who eat huge amounts of fast food and provide cheap labor for fast food restaurants!

Three Strikes and a Touch Down,"This movie had many strikes against it going in. I am not crazy about football movies, or feel-good holiday movies where everyone is without a mean bone in his or her body (except some clichéd curmudgeon who has a Scroogian change of heart in the end whether he/she be a major or minor character). Nor for the emotional manipulations and simplifications that go on when a movie is based on a true story and the filmmakers melodramatize it and dumb it down for the audience. In ""The Blind Side"", if these people were half as good in real life as they are made out to be in this picture, there probably never was any conflict that amounted to anything as melodramatic as the climax here. All that being said, I must give this movie a positive review.""The Blind Side"" also had a strike against it because it reminds me of the cynical joke in ""The Hollywood Shuffle"" about a TV sitcom where a white person takes in a bat played by a black actor and the name of the sitcom is ""There's a Bat in My House"", which is clearly meant to parody every clichéd sitcom about a black person living with a white host.""The Blind Side"" overcomes an awful lot of the strikes against it by being well written, directed and acted. They don't seem as much like clichés while you're watching them. Yet the clichés are all there. That is an amazing achievement. I wouldn't go to a sequel or a remake or other attempt to recapture the magic of this movie because nobody could do it without turning it into utter schmaltz.Sandra Bullock is at the top of her game as Leigh Anne Tuohy, the real-life Memphis woman who decided to take Michael Oher, a good-natured sixteen-year-old underachiever (played sensitively by Quinton Aaron) into her home one Thanksgiving Eve and never let him leave until she and her husband sent him off to college two years later, in the mean time having become his legal guardians, hired a tutor so that he could improve his grades and seen him become sought after by dozens of college football coaches.The only major conflicts in the plot (there are minor conflicts, of course, but we are never really afraid of them) stem from the appearance of impropriety in that the Tuohys and Michael's tutor are all alumni of the University of Mississippi and they all are seen encouraging Michael to accept a football scholarship to ""Ole Miss"". As the investigator from the NCAA suggests, it looks as if the Tuohys did everything that they did for Michael just so that they could boost the football fortunes of their alma mater. In the movie, Michael, who has never considered this possibility until the investigator spells it out, suddenly considers it seriously, and runs away from Leigh Anne and goes back to the projects where he spent part of his childhood. There he nearly gets killed. I smell an injection of melodrama into a more placid real life story where the dramatic conflicts were more mundane if not absent. If the Tuohys are half as good in real life as they are made out to be in this movie, I suspect that Michael would never have believed for a second that they were that nice to him just so that they could exploit him. Human beings are capable of great deviousness, but nobody can sustain an uncrackable facade of faux affection toward someone they do not really love for two whole years, especially if that someone is a teenager.As is often the case in these sorts of movies when they are done well, the pathos is judiciously mixed with gentle humor. I laughed, I cried, goes the cliché and here it was true. I actually enjoyed being manipulated by this movie, and that says a lot considering that it had so many strikes against it going in.Disclaimor: One thing ""The Blind Side"" had in its favor from the get-go is that it stars Sandra Bullock whom I absolutely adore.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The Blind Side is far from a perfect film, but it has enough worthwhile elements to make it worth watching as a family.","I recently rewatched The Blind Side (2009) on Netflix. The storyline follows a young, orphaned boy with no home, no education, and no future, but possessing immense athletic talent. A successful family notices him around town, and their youngest son becomes enamored with him. The family decides to adopt him, providing him with a chance to get an education and showcase his athletic abilities, in hopes of securing a bright future for the young man.Directed by John Lee Hancock (The Founder), The Blind Side stars Sandra Bullock (Speed), Quinton Aaron (Mothers and Daughters), Kathy Bates (Misery), Tim McGraw (Friday Night Lights), and Ray McKinnon (Mud).This movie can be a bit cheesy and, at times, feels like an afterschool special. However, the cast is impressive, and Sandra Bullock delivers a strong performance-she's also stunning in this role. The child acting is excellent and adds a lot of fun to the film. There are also some deep, worthwhile subplots. That said, some sequences are overdone or overacted and don't always feel authentic. Certain aspects of the story seem too good to be true, almost like a TV special. Despite these flaws, the premise is rewarding, and the full-circle elements are triumphant. I also appreciated the flashes to the real-life Michael Oher at the end, which added a nice touch. There is a lot to like here.In conclusion, The Blind Side is far from a perfect film, but it has enough worthwhile elements to make it worth watching as a family. I would rate it a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

You'll find it hard not to be swept away by the story.,"Sandra Bullock has never been a great actress. The 46 y.o. has had her fair share of commercial hits – Speed, Miss Congeniality, The Lake House - but none of these struck gold at the box office because of her dramatic talent; she's easy on the eye and has an endearing personality. Which is why you'll be as surprised as I was when you witness Bullock acting the house down in Blind Side. Powerful, convincing and affecting, she gives her best performance to date as Leigh Anne Tuohy, even if it's not Oscar-worthy as many would have you believe. Although with the Golden Globe already in the bag, the shiny statuette could well find its way into Bullock's hands - a damn shame for Carey Mulligan who deserves the win for An Education.Getting caught up in the hype surrounding Bullock's comeback it is easy to forget that this film has so many other things working for it, least of all that at its core is an intriguing and absorbing story. Writer-director Hancock has an obvious affinity to the material and he doesn't hold back in attempting to wring every drop of emotion from it, even if occasionally a subtler approach would have been favourable. Thankfully, Hancock has crafted some tremendously touching scenes that go a long way in glossing over the seldom spill into pensive melodrama. Those who are excited about seeing some Gridiron action, a la Remember the Titans, best lower their hopes as unfortunately the movie is strangely devoid of any hearty sporting scenes – excluding a pointless training montage that'll make you cringe – which is a severe drawback.Aged 26 in real life, relative unknown Quinton Aaron plays the 16 year old Michael with a nice balance of damage and hope. Big Mike, as he's known in the 'hood, is extremely reticent and withdrawn yet we feel a close connection to him thanks to Aaron's thoughtful portrayal. Kathy Bates continues with her underdone roles of late, here not getting the screen time she deserves as a quirky tutor. Also failing is Jae Head's gregarious S.J.; Leigh Anne's young son who loves the attention his new stepbrother gains him.The content isn't quite strong enough for a runtime of 128 minutes but you'll find it hard not to be swept away by Michael's story.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of those great films to be remembered in time.,"""The Blind Side"" is the most successful Sadra Bullock film ever, maybe Speed and Crash having something to say over this statement.Based on true events, this title tells the story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized Young boy, the product of a poisonous environment in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods. His only chance is the Tuohy family - a wealthy family to say at least - , Leigh Anne Tuohy to be more specific, as she offers her support and invites Michael, to join them for one night at their mansion.Later on,Leigh Anne becomes more and more interested Michael's situation, as she realizes this boy's sufferance and misery. Not long after, the Touhy family decides it's time to legally adopt Michael in order to make him a real member of their family. Meanwhile the discover that Michael has something special, a self-preservation instinct which makes him suitable for contact sports, like American football, and the Tuohy family loves football...The acting was high quality, Sandra Bullock did a fabulous job as Leigh Anne, she was genuine and succeeded in transmitting the wonderful personality of her character. I liked the little actor too, he was very energetic, always in the mood for conversation and funny things to say. It's a fair judgment to say that the entire cast did a great, great work as the film looked realistic and authentic, at least to meI say it one more time, ""The blind side"" is one of the most inspirational and emotional films I've seen in quite a while. I respect and admire the Touhy family, because they didn't just gave Michael a shelter, but treated him with love and care, made him feel like part of their family, and that is really special.I rate this title a well deserved ****1/2 out of ***** (9/10)",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
last section is a letdown,"The first part of this film, dealing with the growing relationship between Michael and his new family, was heart-warming and excellent. Sandra Bullock was delightful as the iron-willed Mom. The boy, S.J., was used only for humour, which was a shame. Much more could have been made of the girl, Collins, if only for eye candy and to take some of the spotlight off Ms. Bullock. The Dad was pretty much a non-entity. But I thought by far the best part of the movie was about the relationships among all these people. Did everything really go that smoothly inside the family? I doubt it. A lot more could have been done with the family.Nevertheless, I was moved by the film. Then came the football part, which was pure Hollywood schlock. Oh my goodness, it's the big game, and guess who's not succeeding? I think I'm gonna have a heart attack. Time's running out. He's going to fail, he's going to let everybody down. Oh, no! But wait. Wait! Can it be, is it true? Glory hallelujah, in the nick of time, he's redeemed himself. Cue the victory music and crank it up loud. Ycchh! For me all that entirely predictable storyline, that stale old sequence seen in hundreds and hundreds of movies coming out of Hollywood, purely paint-by-numbers plotting, took a whole lot of the polish off what otherwise could have been a much, much better film.

The Blind Side,"Micheal Oher (Quinton Aaron) was a large black kid who grew up in the Memphis projects living on people's couches because his crack addicted mom was unfit to take care of him. One day, Tony Hamilton (Omar J Dorsey), trying to enroll his kid into Wingate Christian School, also gets Micheal enrolled in the school. Moving from place to place to find shelter, Michael finally comes across Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy (Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw) who invite him to stay at their house, and eventually invite him to be a part of their family.The story of Micheal Oher is really a quite amazing one. Oher traveled from place to place never really having a place to stay, until he was invited by the Tuohy's to stay with them. Having never remained in a school for more than a year, and failing miserably, the Tuohy's helped him raise his grades to be able to play football (and basketball) in school. Eventually this lead to him being one of the most sought after high school players for college recruiters. Just before the 2009 NFL season he became a first round draft pick for the Baltimore Ravens and became the 2009 Rookie of the Year. With such an amazing story of ""rags to riches"" how does Oher's story translate to film? Very well. One thing that surprised me, and I found refreshing was the fact that a such an openly Christian family was actually treated respectfully and without ridicule. I say this because the movie itself actually has a genuine spirit to it, it doesn't completely feel like a by the numbers inspirational sports movie. The writing does a great job at keeping many of the true things that happened in real life in the movie, moving things around as is typically necessary for screen stories, without making things feel forced. As sports movies go, this movie feels fresher than many that have come in recent years.This, of course, is the movie that not only earned Sandra Bullock her first Oscar nomination, but her first Oscar win as well and for good reason. Playing a character based on a real person is already a daunting task, but for an actress known most for playing America's sweetheart type roles, playing a strong willed genuinely philanthropic Christian woman is definitely not an easy task, but Bullock equips herself well and steals the movie. And Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher does a fantastic job playing Oher as a person who is shy, quiet, and even somewhat cynical, but doesn't allow his cynicism to define him. Throughout the film we watch these layers removed as he becomes more ingrained in the Tuohy household.My biggest problem with the movie is some of the changes they felt the need to make to this already fantastic true story. Michael Oher already knew how to play football before being placed on the team at Briarcrest (the real school that he attended while in the Tuohy home). Making it seem as though he didn't, to me, is an insult to the true character this film is trying to portray. On top of that the story, as portrayed in the film, is a little too good to be true. Having researched the matter a bit there's a lot in the real account of the story that does seem that way, but there was also a bit more struggle to get Micheal's grade's up, and he also wasn't the perfect teen that they depict him as in the movie. This lack of an inner struggle for the main character, as well as the lack of an outer struggle throughout most of the movie drags it down a few notches.All in all, I think it was a really good movie, and while it might not, in my opinion, be an Oscar worthy movie on the best picture front, its definitely one of the better inspirational sports movies to come out in recent memory. Check it out for the performances, the heart warming story, and the inspiration that you will derive from it.3.5/5",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

What can I say? I Don't Know😯,"The Blind Side is a movie that really has some blind sides, they're not so noticeable in the beginning, but when I realized the mistakes, it was bad to watch this movie. Great moral and value, we got an emotional and some sort of ""deep"" story in the movie. Great dialogues, and the football scenes were well made. It was interesting to watch it sometimes. Sometimes, I think this movie was a boring piece of nothing, from my perspective. Michael Oher was introduced fast and popped out from the middle of nothing, we didn't even got any backstory details or flashbacks that could give a bigger idea how he was. We found out more about him in the end, when it didn't really matter, because Michael was such a person that ""forgot things"" but then he started to remember, and we got his bigger flashbacks in the end. I don't know what I can say about that. It feeled weird and out of place. The movie was interesting in the best moments, and sometimes it completely fall down, and was actually very boring. The acting was good, but nothing outstanding or good, it was basic. The music and the camera work was good, but also basic. This movie was basic. And I don't think it is such rememberable. Bunch of scenes that laps together, in to this. It was too long for me, too, could be 20 minutes shorter. The moral about family and protecting the most important people for you, was great, and they showed us some racism, and that it is not ok to do that, but besides the valuable moral and story of Michael Oher, I don't think this was such a great movie. It was too long, wasn't so interesting and it was up and down most of the time. So I can't recommend this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting movie on a non-interesting main topic...,"...at least for me as I am not into sports, and the phenomenon and rules of US football have remained mystery to me. However, from time to time, I watch some sports movies, usually if the persons I admire are involved.As for The Blind Side, the plot based on real persons and events provides a strong additional value, otherwise it could have become a moralizing story about racial tensions, wealth vs. poverty, naive attitudes on helping and alike, quite often present in Western movies aimed at as wide audience as possible. Here, it all makes sense, and we can follow a story of a young Afro-American lad from his scanty upbringing, through his years at Christian school and his adoption, to his position as one of the most appreciated prospects in college football, then finally becoming a first-round pick in the NFL. All the performances are at least good, but my favorites are Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne Tuohy and Jae Head as Sean ""SJ"" Tuohy, Jr., whose roles distinguish from all the others, including Quinton Aaron as Michael ""Big Mike"" Oher who apparently was rather dull in real life. In addition, it was pleasant to notice ""Cinematography by Alar Kivilo"", probably the most known Estonian in Hollywood.All in all, a good movie, although the start was protracted (plus without Bullock), and sports scenes covered quite a big share of the total length. But those ""minuses"" did not call away this generally smooth creation.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Norma Rae, Erin Brockovich, Leigh Anne Touhy","Appalling Best Picture nominee is a combination After School Special and Hallmark Presentation. The Blind Side is based on a tried and true Hollywood formula and is not remotely convincing. Bullock's Leigh Anne, like Norma and Erin, is a feisty Southerner who succeeds with spunk and one-liners, and like Sally Field and Julia Roberts, Bullock won an Oscar;undeserved IMHO, she's perfunctory, the role is a series of quips, and Leigh Anne is less interesting and detailed than either Norma Rae or Erin Brockovich. It's a feel good film, and of course it's satisfying to watch the indomitable Leigh Anne go toe-to-toe with bureaucrats, dubious friends, coaches and homeboys from the projects. Her weapon:zingers. The film is painless at first but it soon lags becomes ridiculous and finally a series smirks from the annoying SJ. Typically, the car accident involving SJ and Big Mike like much of the film is seen coming and like all situations in the film it turns out miraculously well. Bullock's Golden Globe win was in the drama category, but her performance is largely comedic.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Family love,"Can you believe a homeless boy being a top NFL player? It seems impossible but according to this film the answer is yes, and surprisingly, this is a true story. The slam boy Michael was living by himself until a woman takes him to her house. Then he became adopted by that family. He had never played American football, but with a lot of effort and his big strong body, he becomes a good player. He also studies very hard and become smart enough get a scholarship. He then becomes famous and he is scouted by NFL. What is good about this film is that the family is treating him like a real member of the family. The way Michael contact with his brother is funny. What is interesting is that this is a true story and Michael Oher is doing very well in NFL. I don't really see NFL games but this film moved my heart a lot.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Blind Side,"Oftentimes, the opportunity to change someone's life completely is disguised as an isolated random act of kindness. John Lee Hancock's 2009 feature The Blind Side starring Tim McGraw and Sandra Bullock in a career-defining role shows just how far a series of kind acts can go towards changing someone's life and giving them purpose. Seventeen-year-old Michael Oher could have been like the thousands of other disadvantaged persons of color ending up in gangs or victims of violence had it not been for the intervention of one family from Tennessee. In a world where everyone had given up on him, Michael Oher just needed one reason to shine, which he got, and it all started with a new shirt.One rainy night after a high school basketball game, Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) is walking back to the gym, hoping to find some food left behind and a dry bleacher to sleep under. Also leaving the game are Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock), Sean (Tim McGraw), Collins (Lily Collins), and S.J. (Jae Head) Tuohy, an affluent family from Memphis. Seeing the cold, wet young man walking aimlessly in the rain, Leigh Anne instructs her husband to pull over and check on him. When Michael indicates that he is intending to sleep in the gymnasium Leigh Anne insists that he stay overnight with them, intending to figure out his situation in the morning. When the sun rises, it is revealed that Michael has no permanent address, and has gained entry to his exclusive high school through a favor of a friend. Leigh Anne then buys Michael some clothes and designates a room for him in her home, bringing him into their family. As their time together progresses, it is clear the impact the Tuohy family is having on Michael, but what is unexpected is the impact Michael is having on the Tuohy's. Michael is teaching the constantly busy philanthropist Tuohy family to come together more as a family and enjoy their time together, and more importantly, to rise above the societal expectations of their wealth and to always do the right thing. In the deep south, the presence of an African American teenager in a rich white family is heavily judged against and misunderstood by friends and family alike. Nothing will get in the way of Leigh Anne, however, and when Michael shows an interest in football, she stops at nothing to instruct the coach on how to motivate Michael on the playing field and goes the distance to help him qualify for play by improving his grades. When Michael proves to have a natural ability toward football, scouts instantly start noticing him and offering scholarships. After Michael plays for a Division 1 football team, he is selected in the NFL draft in 2009. None of the opportunities that befell upon Michael would have been possible without the Tuohy's, going to show just how much positive impact people can have on one another when they set their mind to it.The Blind Side wastes no time outlining its message, opening the film with video of the break heard 'round the world. The opening shot of the infamous tackle of Lawrence Taylor to Joe Theismann and the way it changed the game of football was a perfect opener to introduce the left tackle highlighted in the film. The film was also bookended well with mention of Lawrence Taylor at the end of the film as well, wrapping together the vehicle that paved the way for Michael Oher's brand of football. Sandra Bullock looks as good as I have ever seen her on-screen, completely capturing the heart and attitude of the real Leigh Anne Tuohy, more than earning her well- deserved Oscar. This film teetered the line between serious and fun in an exquisite way, never disrespecting the real family, and never being too much of a tear-jerker in the wrong places. One of the best examples of this tight-rope walk is the cameos of all the famous college football coaches that made their way into the film. The coaches were a great way to conceptualize the process and a great deal of fun for college football fans in the audience. Kathy Bates as the democrat tutor, the first democrat the Tuohy's ever knew personally to be exact, was a fun addition to the film. It was also nice to see the real Tuohy family pictures as the credits rolled on. The story of the courageous kindness of the Tuohy family is an exemplary example to all of us and a well-needed dose of goodness for the world to see.Sandra Bullock's portrayal as a protective, independent, take no nonsense mother was the shining part of The Blind Side. Her brand of ruthless kindness and an unwavering moral compass was a refreshing change on the common female character that blends into the background. There is no blending with Bullock's portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy, she is clearly in charge of her family and seeks to raise upstanding human beings, whether they are related or not. Her bringing in of Michael Oher into the family was a wonderful mutually beneficial gesture, and one that sticks with the audience to emulate in whatever way is feasible for them.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sentimental and touching,"A movie based on a touching true story. The male lead is a tall, well built kid. He makes me think of my son, who is of the same appearance. It is interesting when he appears with the little and short son of his adopted family.In addition to the female lead, i think the male lead is also worthy of an award. His role is a quiet boy with not much facial expression. But he is cute and innocent even in such a role.

Not great but good enough,"The Blind Side is another one of those inspirational sports movies we've seen time and again. Football is the sport of choice this time as we follow the more or less true story of Michael Oher. His story is a remarkable one, a thoroughly compelling life's journey. And this movie, while nothing spectacular, does an adequate job of telling that story. What we ultimately end up with is a movie that's just entertaining enough to get by. The best sports movies have a crackling energy to them which drives the story forward. This movie, with its leisurely pace, lacks that element. Some might say that is because it's really not a sports movie at all. It's a movie about life that just happens to have some football in it. Maybe so but the movie still cries out for some excitement along the way. You may like this movie. But it's not one of those movies that makes you want to jump out of your chair and cheer. It's inspiring but in a more subtle fashion than one might expect. The movie works but it probably could have worked better.The movie tells the by now familiar story of Michael Oher's rise from a life of poverty, neglect and misery to football stardom. The story's obvious hook is that of the troubled black teen being taken in, and ultimately adopted, by a wealthy white family. A fascinating true story, one recounted pretty faithfully here by the filmmakers. A few things from the real life story have been tweaked to give the movie a little added drama but that's the way the movie business works. And the movie could use the extra drama because if there is any one failing here it is that this great story at times comes across as being a little mundane. It's that troubling lack of energy, the movie really could use a little more pep in its step.This is the Michael Oher story but the movie's star is of course Sandra Bullock playing Michael's adopted mother Leigh Anne Tuohy. It's a very good, strong-willed performance by Bullock. Nothing about the performance which absolutely screams out Oscar but there's certainly no reason to begrudge her the award. Like the movie itself you may hesitate to label her performance great but it's more than good enough. Quinton Aaron plays Michael and you kind of wish he was given more to do. He does well with what he's given to work with but there are long stretches of the movie where his character is essentially mute and appears rather bewildered. Michael Oher is often shunted to the background in the movie which purports to tell his life story. It's Bullock as Leigh Anne who's really at the heart of everything going on.While Bullock is definitely pushed front and center there is room for some other performers to make an impression. Lily Collins and Jae Head are very good in portraying the Tuohy children, with Head in particular having some memorable moments. Tim McGraw is solid if unspectacular as Leigh Anne's husband Sean, spending most of his time reacting to or getting out of the way of Bullock. Kathy Bates, Kim Dickens and Ray McKinnon do well with their respective supporting roles. And of course there's Big Mike himself. On the rare occasions Aaron is allowed to come out of his shell he's a revelation. And he does a great job in making his character utterly sympathetic, so easy to root for. But in the end, for better or worse, it's Bullock's movie. She carries it well enough to make the movie work. But you're left with the nagging sense the movie probably should have been a little better. Ultimately you're satisfied but not thrilled. It's a sports movie which comes out a winner by the slimmest of margins.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ferdinand the Bull indeed,"I felt sorry most of the time for him, but that's life and some people are like that and we must be grateful and cherish those kinds. They are rare and hidden these days because you see in this movie too why. I enjoyed it, but not as much as I wanted, my scepticism was always on guard like the lady questioning him at the end. It was a bit too convenient for him, but unfortunately this is the society we live in, we are getting harder and harder to believe in such stories, in such people who really want to help without reasons, selfless. Besides this, it was a warm and uplifting movie, giving a little bit of hope, even being tried by some tears, not gonna' lie. I expected, as I was seeing in the poster, a football story, more games to be played, like in all the other movies, but it's a good thing, I liked this story how was told behind the games with all the aspects and feelings of the player in the non game time. The cast was great and all played well their part. Sandra's performance was interesting, different, but not her best. The win is justified more because the other nominees weren't as good as her, but the nomination, no doubt was deserved, as well as the best motion picture nomination. I love the ending of biopic movies, seeing the ""originals"". We need more movies like this. Well done to everyone! Peace and Love!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Blind-sided by Quinton Aaron, bullish on Bullock","Disclaimer: I often think that movie makers DO get the books right at least 50% of the time (& sometimes they actually improve upon them).This movie proved to be a really nice surprise.I love the book & 20/20 piece did a nice job on the story so I felt I had already seen the movie. (So why spend $10 on it?)The actor cast as Oher did not look intimidating enough (as he is initially portrayed in the book) to pull off the unlikely transition that is the key to this true story so I thought this would be Leigh Anne Touhy's story due to all the press about Sandra Bullock's performance in it.I was wrong. Oher is the main character & Quinton Aaron proved more than capable of portraying this complex young man as I remember him in Michael Lewis's excellent prose. BUT it is also the Touhys' family story as well & Bullock well deserves the Oscar nom she is likely to get. Unfortunately for her & the movie it may too down-home-value oriented for her to get the statue.The movie is schmaltzy, a bit corny & pushes some obvious emotional buttons (things I typically hate in a movie) but John Lee Hancock & his players never push too hard. The true story itself is incredible. The movie's makers know this & are smart enough not to over sell it --in fact they actually pull back from a scene on the football field that Lewis described in further detail when Oher finally decides enough is enough.If you liked REMEMBER THE TITANS (which pushed buttons much further & got away with it) then you'll love this movie. It is one of the best of the year, but be quiet & don't tell ""Hollywood"" that.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A good story of helping someone, his success, and a family's blessings","""The Blind Side"" is a different, and quite unusual story of one person helping another who is down and out. It's not a typical biopic about a kind person who starts an orphanage; or a saintly person who rescues the homeless on the streets; or a hero who starts a charity to build a hospital in a poor country. Rather, this is about a woman who wasn't driven for any particular charitable or humanitarian cause, who simply responded to a situation and circumstances she came across to help one person. And, in the process, she found that it filled the gap of something that was missing in the lives of her family. As the real Leigh Anne Touhy says, when Michael Oher joined their family, ""It had a far greater impact on our lives than it did on his life.""Indeed, that is the reality that many people discover when they reach out to help someone else. For people of faith, acts of charity inevitably lead to changes in their lives that they see as blessings.This is a wonderful movie about a true story, based on a 2006 book by Michael Lewis, ""The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game."" It's a drama and sports story about a 17-year-old boy who was living on the streets in Tennessee, who was taken into a home and made part of a family, and who then became a standout football player through college and as a pro in the National Football League.Sandra Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy superbly, and won the best actress Oscar and best actress Golden Globe for her role.

"No one will be blind to the beauty of this true and very inspirational story, Michael Oher is a genuine hero","Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) has just had the ""good fortune"" to be accepted into a private, Christian school in Memphis. Once the football coach got a glimpse of ""Big Mike"", he was determined to get the teenager enrolled, for the lad is very tall and very broad. But, unknown to everyone, Michael has had a difficult life up to this very moment. He has been in and out of foster homes for years, after the authorities discovered his mother's drug habit and his father's absence. At the present, he is living at the all-night laundromat, where each night he washes out his two shirts. The teachers at the school learn Michael is bright but can not read or write well. Alas, too, the other pupils don't extend the hand of friendship. One day, however, an elementary student named SJ strikes up a conversation with Michael that makes the big guy smile. Later that night, SJ and his parents, Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock) and Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw) are driving home from a school event when they spy Mike, coat-less, walking out in the cold. When Leigh Anne learns SJ knows the teen, she insists on asking Michael to come home with them for the night. Learning a few necessary facts, Leigh Anne and Sean soon invite Michael to stay with them as long as he wants. Before many weeks have passed, Michael is a part of the family and has his own room and some new clothes. The Tuohys also help Michael with his school work so that he will be able to make the football team. But, will Michael's past come back to haunt his relationship with his new, loving family? This is an outstanding movie that is very touching and very inspirational. Michael Oher is one truly courageous and hard-working athlete who opened his heart to a new family and a new life when he met the Tuohys. Yes, this rich Memphis couple deserve much praise, also, for their efforts to turn Michael's existence in a new direction. But, only Michael could have made the extreme changes and dedication that allowed him to flourish, on the football field and in school. Bravo, Michael, bravo and more. As the principal characters, Bullock, McGraw, Kathy Bates and especially Aaron are most wonderful. All of the lesser actors are very fine, too. The setting in Memphis is authentic, from the worst side of town, where Michael was born, to the best, where the Tuohys reside. Costumes and production values are terrific, as are the script and surefooted direction. In short, make certain that you include time for you and yours to see this absolutely winning movie. No one will be blind to the beauty of its tale of love and triumph.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Inspiring movie, worth watching","""The Blind Side"" is an America sports drama film. Actually, I have never watch a football game before. Nevertheless, I enjoy the whole plot a lot, and I was inspired by the non-fictional story.It's talking about the life of a homeless teenager - Michael Oher and the process which he struggled to conquer obstacles, especially grades, social problems. After Michael met Leigh Anne, he became a member of Tuohy's family. Not only did his life change, but it also made Leigh Anne think that her life was changed, too. Thanks to Michael's over-sized shape and amazing talent, he became a football player.In my opinion, you cannot choose the environment where you live or even every predicaments you meet. Despite that, we have the chance to struggle so as to overcome all the plight. In the process, it is necessary to find a reason to stand by you, such as the Tuohy to Michael.The part which I like the most is the lunch that Leigh Anne with her friends. When they are discussing Michael, one of the lady says"" You're changing that boy's life"", but Leigh Anne response, ""No. He's changing mine.""Furthermore, I love the theme which can see SJ, the little son of Leigh Anne. No matter what he say or what he does, he always make me laugh. It's no exaggeration that he is an important role to this film.I learned many valuable lessons by watching this movie and it was definitely a fabulous experience.

"The Blind Side is a majestic, heartfelt and insightful film that would work perfectly for the Relationship classes that are now taught in High School and College","From 2009 to the present day, I wrote off The Blind Side like it was nothing. I've never been a big football fan even though it is the most popular sport in the United States and I just got tired of all the praise that this film got. As with any film though, The Blind Side can't be judged until it's watched. It offers like a dozen things that seems to come out of nowhere and it's very likable indeed. An overall great film.Based on a true story, The Blind Side follows around homeless teen Micheal Orr (Quinton Aaron) who never grew up with parents who were there for him and who's really got nothing going for him. Like a billet family, Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) and her husband Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw) take Micheal in and raise him in a proper home that he never had. They show him the ways of life and Michael ends up turning into a football star through it all.It sounds exactly like a football film but it also has the elements of family, how to do well in school and also how to channel violence in the right way. Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw play perfect parents and Bullock's work here won her the Best Supporting Actress Oscar Award in 2010. Collins (Lily Collins) and S.J. (Jae Head) play the kids of the family and both come off as unexpectedly good and add fun and humor to the film.Another reason this cannot be considered just a full football film is the racial issues touched on here. This part of the story is of a African-American teenager trying to live in the South where we know it can be hard and the film tries to deliver the message that everybody is the same regardless of the color of your skin. I think this is one of the important messages in this world today and it is always nice when a film touches on this.Once we get to the football scenes, we can't stay it's bad either. It's typical in the sense that it shows the character Michael Orr developing a toughness that wasn't there before. It also adds a football flavor to an already packed film and it is fun to watch cameos from college football coaches Nick Saban to Lou Holtz. Don't expect any good acting from these coaches but that is to be expected and the quality of the acting by the cameos is kind of beside the point anyway.The Blind Side is a majestic, heartfelt and insightful film that would work perfectly for the Relationship classes that are now taught in High School and College. The film is mostly for teenagers but also for the whole family too. Expect a tearjerker though.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Wonderful film if it were more true, instead it is rather poorly done","But most simply, the young man knew football. Loved football, and was already adept at playing tackle as an offensive lineman. He was certainly blindsided by a portrayal of him as slow-witted. That he needs Sandra Bullocks character to explain to him his job as a tackle is ludicrous. Even ignoring the white family saves the world angle, Michael knew football.So why write it this way. Come on, you have Bullock, a strong actress, who could have emotionally been there regarding Michael's moms struggle with poverty, and addiction. And the relationship with their son is touching without a 9 year old teaching Michael plays. That he got tutoring to help him base standardized tests and excel at University, also moving. No need to portray him as intellectually challenged.Forget all that, and yes it is entertaining. But don't say based on a true story while basically demeaning the star athlete.

Super Sandra does make the cut as one of the best performances of 2009!,"Actress Sandra Bullock is on the top of her game in the sports drama ""The Blind Side"". The movie is based on the real life story of a wealthy southern socialite's caretaking of an underprivileged inner city teen who turned out to be NFL Rookie Left Tackle Michael Oher. His childhood was not too different than other young black boys living in the inner city. His father had mental issues, and his mother was a crack addict trying to raise a handful of children. Young Oher traveled from foster home to foster home during this time. As a teen, Oher was reserved, isolated, and near mute. But one could not be blinded to his enormous body frame and athletic talent. A catholic high school coach gets introduced to Oher and convinces school administration to bring that Oher on board even though he does not have the academic aptitude required in such a school. But here enters Leigh Anne Tuohy, the wealthy wife of a restaurant franchise owner, who takes in the solitaire teen Oher into their home. Leigh Anne has two kids of her own in the sweet teenage girl Collins and the charismatic young boy S.J.; Collins is a bit more reserved at first in welcoming Michael while S.J. adores him from the start. Like S.J., Leigh Anne's husband Sean (played by Tim McGraw, yes that one country boys & girls) is also very supportive of Michael from its huddling beginning. Eventually, the Tuohys become the left and right guards of Michael by becoming his legal guardians. Writer-Director John Lee Hancock does not block the formulaic inspirational & sentimentality themes of most sports films but in ""The Blind Side"" but he presents it with goodwill tones instead of salvation armies rah-rah's as most other sports narratives; so kudos to Hancock for his superpower donations in quarterbacking ""The Blind Side"". Hancock's screenplay is a bit cliché filled but he did open up the lines for some touching messages on caring for others. But what will sweep you away the most of ""The Blind Side"" is the commanding performance of Sandra Bullock as the vigorous but yet endearing Leigh Anne Tuohy. All the supporting acting performances follow her lead; but not even in the same ""pro acting bowl"" category as hers. Even the great master Bates, (Kathy that is) playing Michaels's tutor could not compare to Bullock's tour-de-force work. It would be complete bullocks if Sandra is not handed off a Best Actress Academy Award. I think I have tackled my viewpoints on ""The Blind Side"" so now it is your turn to call your plays on this non-offensive movie which I am sure will open your hearts. ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Refreshing and uplifting,"Quite the opposite of Avatar, my expectations were low for The Blind Side, a film whose trailer rubbed me the wrong way. I'm all for inspirational films, but this one looked like an overcooked, manipulative tearjerker with Sandra Bullock stepping way outside of her comfort zone to play a Good Samaritan Southern Belle who helps a struggling black teen with a painful past. I was afraid the film would exploit or gloss over the true pains of African-Americans struggling to escape the projects. I was afraid Sandra Bullock, whose forte is romantic comedies, would annoy with an attempt at a Southern accent. I was afraid that the power of this true story would be lost in hackneyed and trite film-making.My fears were unfounded, and one cannot, it appears, judge a film by its trailer. This is one of the best mainstream films about Christians I've ever seen, possessing charm, integrity, and honesty in spades. Bullock's stab at a Southern accent, while dubious in a two-minute trailer, is actually quite convincing when viewed in the complete film. She truly loses herself in the role, and much to my surprise, I'd like to see her win an Oscar for her tough-love portrayal of a woman whose cannot help but help others. Country- music superstar Tim McGraw, as her husband, proves himself a capable actor, Granted, he doesn't have to do any heavy emotional lifting in the film, but his ability to deliver lines of dry humor was an unexpected delight. Newcomer Quinton Aaron, as the young man helped by Bullock's family, conveys a great deal of pain, sorrow, and joy with his eyes.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
BLIND SIDE Worth watching,"I loved this film its nice to think people do still help each other. Also I congratulate the film makers on the scene when Michael Oher was pushing the two little girls on the swings, it was good to see a lovely gesture not made into something more sinister, its sad that I notice this. I really enjoyed this film and its not often you don't want a film to end . It was nice to see the family photos on the end credits. Another thing I loved was Michael was loved by his new family and it does not matter about blood or the colour of you skin . I shall go to bed with sweet dreams. Sandra Bullock was amazing as always, she really made me forget that she is an actress and not Micheals mama . The two you actors that played SJ and Collins were very talented especial SJ . Tim McGraw was very good and like every good man he made sure he agreed with his wife or are they so close that he just knew. I really enjoyed Kathy Bates I admit was a bit worried about her character at 1st but it was set perfectly .",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great movie!!!,"This is an inspirational movie about a black orphan who, with the help of white adoptive parents, overcomes a poor upbringing and plays in the NFL. The content of the story is mainly about how Mike met, understood, understood, and cherished the Touhy family. Leigh Anne found out that Michael was homeless and wanted to adopt him formally, but because Michael's father had passed away, his mother could not raise him normally due to drug use, which made Michael an orphan. Leigh Anne's friend warned her that if Michael and Leigh Anne's children live together, it will affect their social relationship. Because of Michael's skin color, Lianne's friends worry that the school's students will reject or bully Lianne's children. After Michael joined the school's American football team and achieved excellent results, he was also selected by the University of Mississippi's American football team, but the NFL doubted the purpose of the Touhy family's adoption of Michael. This made Michael very sad and ran away from home. Michael was sad because he felt that he was being used, and the Touhy family didn't really treat him like family. After Michael ran away from home, the Tui family worked very hard to find him. After Michael came back, he told NFL investigators: ""This is where my family goes to school."" Michael was willing to come back because Lianne told him that no matter what he wanted to do, she would support him, which convinced Michael that Lianne regarded him as his son.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

This is all very well but the problem with this scenario is that children from bad backgrounds are not friendly bears: This child ""Friendly Mike"" has no aggressive personality and is simply a really nice kid who happens to have grown up in the wrong part of town. A good film would have examined the difficulties of adopting a child from a poor background and would have the problems that develop with this situation. Instead the rich white family happen to have a perfect child who displays no negative attributes. The question that you need to ask yourself is: what would have happened if the child had robbed the family after his first opportunity to live with them? would they have given up on them or tried to teach him the ways of a better life? The blind side doesn't address any of these issues and simply deals with adopting a child from an underprivileged background who just happens to be perfect already.An unrealistic story line which would never happen. Nice for those with an unrealistic perspective on life. Would possible have been fine 20 years ago but films have come along way since then and Hollywood needs to address realistic issues.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sandra's Oscar Nomination!,"Something is going to be wrong if Sandra Bullock isn't awarded an Academy Award Nomination for Best Actress for her performance Leigh Anne Tuohy, a Memphis interior designer, wife, and mother to Collins (a girl) and Sean Jr. She is married to successful Sean Tuohy, a former basketball star. They are both alums of Ole Miss or University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi. Bullock does her best as portraying Leigh Anne to be both flawed and credible. She doesn't overdue her performance as the wealthy white woman who brings Big Mike home to their million-dollar home in Memphis for one night which lasts a couple of years. She warms up to him who changes the family in ways that probably wouldn't have been possible. Big Mike prefers to be called Michael. Until he became homeless, he was living on the couch of a neighbor in the slums who offered a place to stay because his mother has substance problems. Michael has flashbacks to his childhood but the film doesn't dwell on it so much. Michael gets into a private Christian school because they think he can play football. He comes with the man, Tony and his son, Steven. After Michael starts school, we hear an argument with Tony and his wife over Michael's situation.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Well done drama!,"The film The Blind Side directed by Hancock (2009), written from a true story about Michael Oher, played by Quinton Aaron, is a fun and touching view into how lives can be changed when a selfless family helps someone without any family of his own to speak of. Leigh Anne Tuohy, played by Sandra Bullock, a busy career woman, wife, and mother sees a need and fills it, when she and her supportive husband Sean (Tim McGraw) find Michael homeless and walking in the rain. Humble Michael blends well with the Tuohy family as he learns and teaches lots of life lessons, ending up a star.The themes of the drama touch on several categories. Categories such as social concerns around the disparity in income and access within the same city; and human dignity as a young man struggles to survive outside of the community he knows. But, most of all, the human relationships of people from a variety of social and financial backgrounds and how they can help and learn from one another as they grow into more fulfilled individuals. In addition, the film shows how people can grow to love and nurture others like family in a relatively short period of time.Though the film begins rather slowly, the editing and sound crews do wonders in bringing to life. The use of flash and parallel cuts by the editor brings attention to the drama, fears, and action throughout the film. Both produced and ambient sounds along with the music in the movie heighten the experiences as if one were sitting in the car, the stands, or the living room with the family as they go through their daily adventures. When the time is taken to analyze the techniques used in the making of the film, it is amazing what the professionals behind the scenes can do to enhance the viewer's experience.All in all the film is masterfully put together and may be useful in teaching many the joys and self-fulfillment received when stepping out of their comfort zone to share themselves and their good fortune with others. Much like the film Pretty Woman produced by Milchan (1990), also starring Sandra Bullock as Vivian, not only does the family rescue Michael from a life of despair and misfortune, but he ""rescues them right back"" by teaching them humility and gratitude. One can be fairly certain that Michael has not forgotten his ""family"" as he moved on to enjoy a successfully career with the Ravens.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great adaptation,"I've just watched this film. I read this story as written by Michael Lewis, which is very interesting to read also. Great book, very good movie indeed. I never thought Sandra Bullock, who is a star, could also be as good as she is in this role. Her performance is not spectacular, because her character is phenomenal, but she clearly understood the essence of Lee-Anne Twohy as described by Michael Lewis. I've enjoyed the film very much. I was expecting some dramatic Hollywood-twisted scenes without any link with the real story of Michael Oher, who is also a phenomenon by himself. But not. There are a couple of scenes when you can guess, even if you have not read the book, that are just too much. But it's made with a nice sensibility. And it's a true story, totally unbelievable. A screenwriter would have imagine this story, any producer would have dumped it. It's impossible to dislike this film. Just a small problem: for people who are not fluent in English, the Southern accent of Nashville characters is hard to catch. But it does not reduce the fun to watch it even if translated. This family is unique and their story was to be told.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Absolutely Beautiful,"For years I have adored Sandra Bullock. For me, she pales all those screen sirens through the ages into insignificance and ""The Blind Side"" expresses her unequaled talent and natural beauty superbly! As an Aussie, I know nothing at all about American Football (and, from what I have seen on movies and TV, I don't particularly want to!). That's not to knock it though - I just don't understand it and, since it is pretty well exclusive to the USA, I have no real need to. However, that's not the point of this review. In actual fact, the game doesn't matter. The point is that the Tuohy family - and Leigh-Anne (Bullock) in particular see the potential and the need in a young man who couldn't be much more different from their own lifestyle and they give helping him their everything (and MORE).Bearing in mind that ""The Blind Side"" is based on a true story, all I can say is that I would have loved to have known the Tuohy family. What awesome Christians from Dad to the young son. Actually, all the time I watched this film, I couldn't help seeing a family that attends my own church here in Queensland. The total absence of any sort of jealousy and the genuine love that emanated from every member of that family was just SO like my friends. (Actually, my friends here would make great subjects for a similar biographical drama - but I know their modesty would never let that happen! Pity really!)When the pictures came on with the credits at the end I was amazed at how well all five actors portrayed the real Tuohys and Michael. (Didn't Sandra look gorgeous as a blonde too! - I'm not biased!!) So this is the second time in as many weeks that I have sat through a movie centred around American Football and loved every minute of them (the other one was ""The Grid Iron Gang""). I don't mind admitting that I had to wipe the occasional tear from my eye during this one too. How refreshingly pleasant to watch a movie where the predominance is on decent, loving and caring people rather than an over-abundance of violence, profanity and unpleasantness - especially when it's a true story. If I could, I'd give this 11 out of 10 and, if it doesn't win some major awards, the judges are all dormant!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Blindness,"Boy, The Blind Side tried. It really did attempt to be a tear jerker.If it weren't for an interview I heard/saw from the real-life Michael Oher (played here by Aaron) who said barely a scene actually happened – stating most were for, well, dramatic effect, it still would fail at being 100% interesting.Oher's homeless after his druggie mother (of, like 15 kids she may/may not remember giving birth to) doesn't want anything to do with him, as are the other caretakers, he runs into stuck-up rich wife gal Leigh Anne (Bullock) and she takes him in. Showing she's not perfect, even she admits the first night, she worries a person of color will steal from (or harm) her family. Guess what? Oher ends up being someone decent, albeit reclusive and attaches himself to the rich family's kindness.Eventually he opens up, feels more safe and proves that football's his thing. So much, that the coincidentally ex-cheerleader mom encourages him further and then into a college scholarship. Throw in some outrageously Lifetime drama of a conflict on which school he chooses and you'll get the ""exciting"" climax of him making it big on his own terms.These all sound like complaints. And they're really not. This movie wasn't bad, per se, but not great. It tried too hard, way too hard for tears of the audience. I'll admit: it nearly got me in a few scenes.Unfortunately, before I could fully get emotional, the movie shifts gears and I'm back to watching a movie that should have, in fact, ended on the Lifetime Channel verses the big screen.The more I heard about Bullock's performance – Oscar worthy, they say, I had to see this movie. She was really good, I will say. The best? No. Great, even? Again, no. But really good. I believed every scene she was in as mother-of-the-week Leigh Anne Touhy. Was this her best performance? Or the best she could be? By no means, that's a negative. Heck, not only was she better in Speed, her absolute best job was in 2005's Crash, in which, she wasn't even nominated. Like Pacino, who onlyONLY for the love of Petewon an Oscar for one role (Scent of a Woman), Bullock will probably be recognized for The Blind Side, despite her being so much better in Crash. It's those old Oscar cronies way of making up for past mistakes, as they generally do.Was the movie worth watching? Sure. For the (waaay over used) great (based on, inspired by, etc) true FOOTBALL movies? Not really. If you're looking for that, look elsewhere. And having literally hundreds of the ""true"" football films come out in the past two+ decades, it shouldn't be hard to find. This one has basically one real football game scene and a few practices. It's more about overcoming prejudices, charity, the 'hood and, of course, Bullock's Oscar chances. See it, if everything else is sold out.SIDE NOTE: Like many other ""TRUE STORIES"" that use a tremendous amount of unrealistic but dramatic scenes that, for the most part, are entered in to move the story along to fit in years of lives in mere hours, The Blind Side hit a nerve with me. In one of the key plot points, the young boy of the Touhy family (Head) films all of Oher's football practices and games. He eventually sends a copy to the recruiter's office and from there, every single, and I mean EVERYONE of the, recruiting colleges/universities want this rather large soon-to-be football player. Here's my petpeeve: Though I know, once again, these types of movies thrive on the heavy drama (to make us weep!) and have to get the job done in under 3 hours (short attention span, audience, eh?) they cut corners with extreme amateur videos (the boy was about 10) that are professionally made. For example, he's completely stationary yet, the film follows the action on the field, namely Oher. Not only did this type of filming never occur, it was extremely hard to buy the recruiters sitting back, laughing, high-fiving their way to dollar-signs in their eyes due to the ""excellent footage"" they're witnessing on their monitors. Give me a freaking break.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best movies I have seen in a long time,"Most of the positive readers have already said it all: great acting; great story, well produced, uplifting movie. I didn't see one bad actor in the film.This is possibly Bullock's best film. Can't understand negative comments by a few people practically denying the good deeds and the good will of this well to do family who shared what they had and lived their Christian faith in a practical way. Teenagers watch cheap ""B"" films. Older men like me bring their entire families and praise films like this by word of mouth. This film is a jewel.One last note...I am an older person training in acting, just won best adult monologue at the Dallas Expo Nov 17-21.I recognized Patrick G.

"""Precious"" in a More Positive Light","One of my favorite actresses finally gets a Golden Globe Best Actress award, and most likely an Oscar nomination will follow, with a role in this movie. So with that incentive, I went and sought out to watch Sandra Bullock in ""The Blind Side.""This movie is a true story about an abandoned black gentle-giant teenager Michael Oher adopted by a wealthy white Southern family, the Tuohys. It is a story that is pushing the boundaries of racial relations. It is amazing in that this unlikely story actually happened in real life. A fictional story like this could potentially be offensive. However, with genial storytelling and the general good will of the stars, a warm feel-good message is sent across to the audience. I personally felt that this movie is like ""Precious"", in an infinitely more positive and watchable, albeit somewhat sugar-coated, light.Sandra Bullock is very much herself here in the role of Leigh Anne Tuohy. I do not really see anything special that she did to merit awards consideration. She is her reliable good-natured persona that made her star since ""Speed"". But that said, I am glad that she is recognized for her fine work. The other members of the cast were also very good. I did not recognize country star Tim McGraw without his hat, but he held his own against Sandra. The youngest Touhy kid is scene-stealing cute without verging into annoying. The actor who played Michael is well-cast, a charming embodiment of the meek yet tough character.For the general local audience unfamiliar with American football, these scenes may be lost on most of us. They did try to explain in layman's terms what the left offensive tackle (Michael's position on the football team) does. The actual cameo appearances of real American college football coaches will certainly be lost to us as well. However, the very heart and soul message of the movie, that of helping out the less fortunate among us despite social repercussions, will surely reverberate.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A family great.,"I have seen this film 2 times now and each time it managed to put a smile on my face, i have only just got up from watching this with my entire family, ages ranging from 14-76. I can honestly tell you that not one person in that room would have rated it other than 10. Heres a few reasons why: Sandra Bullock did play her part amazingly well but in truth all of the actors seemed to fit and everything just feels quite natural and they support each other fantastically.The story flows quite quickly but at a pace which i think fits ( you would have to watch the film to truly understand this comment) The occasional one liners that help to disperse the drama and keep a smile on everyones face without making the film seem to corny.The actual plot is truly inspiring but i don't want to ruin it for you, i can say that only the most steel hearted of people would struggle to feel something.The so called ""negatives"" I have noticed many people talking about stereotyping and the poor portrayal of ethnic groups etc. However this is a True story, so how can the story be unrealistic? As for the stereotyping well some of that surely must have come from Michael Oher in which case its not stereotyping but in fact what he saw through his eyes. Some say he is portrayed as a dumb child in need of white Christian aid, when in fact it is quite clearly stated by one of the teachers that he is actually intelligent but just shy. Surely he must have signed off on this book and how he must have seen himself? I would strongly recommend you to watch this film yourself and see your own reaction to it whether it be a simple smile or a sense of inspiration.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Delivers what you'd expect.,"A quintessential feel-good movie, about the only thing unexpected here is that Dennis Quaid didn't play the father! Instead we get Tim McGraw hiding under a wig and delivering a fairly decent performance as the successful hen-pecked husband of Sandra Bullock. The Blind Side is the mostly true story of Michael Oher, a disadvantaged Memphis teen who is taken in by a wealthy family and turned into a good student and a great offensive tackle. I just watched Oher and his Baltimore teammates run wild over Tom Brady's Patriots today, as a matter of fact.Obviously when you go to see a movie like this, you already know the ending. Unless you don't watch football or have no idea who Micheal Oher is. So the challenge for the filmmakers is to construct a compelling story of how he got to where he is today. And for the most part John Lee Hancock and company make it worthwhile. Not only do we come away understanding Oher's very difficult childhood, be we also get a feel for just how big a risk the Touhy family is potentially taking by inviting him into their home. Though it is suggested at one point that they are only grooming a great athlete for service at their alma mater, we can clearly see that the Touhys care about Michael as a student and a person as well.The cast is generally up to the task at hand. Bullock is fairly convincing as an attractive southern belle whose idea it originally is to offer Michael a place to stay. Will she get any Oscar consideration? Probably not, but who knows. Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher might have been a bit too pudgy for the role but his portrayal will make you care about the man's plight. There are also quite a few real-life coaches playing themselves to varying degrees of success. None of these men currently hold the coaching positions they did when this movie takes place. Congrats to Tommy Tuberville on his getting the Texas Tech job this weekend. He's a good man who won't be locking any players in closets like someone we know. Football fans more than anyone else will like this movie best of course. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sandra Bullock Deserves Serious Oscar Look,"Just a comment on the main character. Perfect look, perfect clothes, perfect attitude, style, house, furniture, car, etc.They nailed the character and Sandra Bullock was perfect in every way.

Hmm. An emotional rollercoaster.,"Hello
This is my first time writing a review. So please bare with me. Thank you in advance.First off. I was on an emotional rollercoaster the whole time. I usually avoid these type of films. For this very reason. I was hooked from the very beginning. This is an amazing story. That I am very glad I was able to be aware of. It is a reminder of the true greatness within. I was so captivated by the story because I could relate on so many levels. I believe it will affect many the same way. I am not going to reveal any of the actual story but I will hopefully entice you to give this a try.I initially thought this was going to be another white guilt success story. It is so much more. There is no guilt. Even when Sandra Bullock is correcting someone. It is always helpful. Never hurtful. A philosophy I strongly believe in. She is an amazing actress as well as human being. I speak from experience. I had the pleasure of working with and meeting this amazing woman in person. I was fortunate enough to be hired twice as a background performer in a movie where she was both producer and actor. She is very grounded with a strong appreciation for her success. This film will reignite your spirit to be a better person. That's all I will say. Thank you very much for taking the time to read it.Please enjoy and have a wonderful day.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
how did this win an award?,"I think the Acadamy is being very kind to Sandra Bullock by giving her the best actress award for this movie. Rarely have I seen a more irritating, feel good fetish. It is so predictable that it would be almost impossible to include spoilers in the review, but for the benefit of the mentally deficient I'll try not to give away too much. Basically, its the story of a gentle giant who gets adopted by the most nauseatingly nice family since the Brady Bunch. Our hero, ""Big Mike"" is a misfit kid from the projects who gets accepted into a high performing high school. One night, as he's making his way to the gym, were he sleeps, the Touhey family take pity on him and take him into their perfect family home. This is were Sandra Bullock takes control of the plot and of the whole movie. There's no doubt in my mind that Director John Lee Hancock molded this movie to make Sandra Bullock look like the award winning actress she isn't. Her husband, Sean, played by Tim McGraw, is the most pointless character in movie history. Even a henpecked husband would be more humorous than the impotent piece of passivity this man represents. Son, S.J., played by Jae Head, is one of those annoying child characters who gets way too much screen time and daughter, Collins, played by Lily Collins has to be the most understanding teenage girl ever to feature in a Hollywood movie. Quinton Aaron, who plays ""Big Mike"" does as good a job as he's let, given that he dare not steal attention from Sandra Bullock's dominance. There's one good scene when he returns to the bad guys in the projects were he grew up. It's the only good scene actually, probably because Sandra Bullock is not in it. I won't bore you with the details of the whole football plot, you'll guess were its going very early on; especially when Sandra Bullock's character starts telling the coach what to do. Apart from the ""Boys in the Hood"" in Mike's old neighborhood, there's just one other bad guy, but he's just a loud mouth racist at a football game who Sandra Bullock deals with predictably. There's shades of ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" ""Good Will Hunting"" and even ""Shine"" in this movie. Sadly though, those shades are quickly obliterated by Miss Bullocks ego.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Michael: ""It's nice, I never had one before."" Leigh Anne: ""What, a room to yourself?"" Michael: ""A bed.""","Purely in terms of personal enjoyment this is like a 20/10, I absolutely loved it. It was so heartbreaking as we got to hear slightly more and more of Michael's background. I say slightly though, as I wish we could've seen a lot more background in the beginning.Also wish we got more extended interactions between Michael and the other members of the family, as it didn't feel like his relationships with said members had built properly, everything was all cut together and hence those connections didn't feel like they had naturally come into fruition.But yeah I loved the story, the small twist (it wasn't really a twist but I didn't know what else to call it) shocked me and for a moment I actually thought this movie might end in an unpredicted way that would truly make this stand out against other sport biopics out there.Sandra Bullock (as Leigh Anne Tuohy) and Quinton Aaron (as Michael Oher) were remarkable, the latter was especially outstanding. I have to say I'm surprised that he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his performance here.However, the main thing about the film itself that I believe made it undeserving of a 10/10 rating was that there were some key scenes that were too predictable. In some cases you could tell what was going to unfold even when the scene had only just started.Once I'd finished the film I was fully set on giving it a 9, but after comparing the facts with the fiction, I will have to lower my rating. One big problem I have is that they portrayed Oher as someone who was innately stupid, and they completely failed in making it clear that his lower-than-average level of intellect was as a result of not having gone through a proper education system due to his poor upbringing. Also they made it seem as if he wasn't already all that knowledgeable in the game of American football and he needed assistance from the people who he knew, when in reality he was not only familiar with how to play, but purely through his own self-teachings he became a stellar player. There's actually a ton of other problems but we'd be here all day if I went through all of them. I still don't want to bring my rating down any further than a 8 though purely because of how much I enjoyed the movie itself, I still consider it to be a special movie.One final thing I will say is that I don't consider this picture to be as ""white saviour"" as others seem too, as racism wasn't the main focus. Rather, to me at least, this was simply about somebody taking in a kid from a poor background. It's as simple as that, in my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Blind Side An Excellent Drama Based On A True Story,"The Blind Side is an excellent drama based on a true story with exceptional performances by the cast. This film is about Michael Oher a homeless teenager who went on to become a first round NFL draft pick of the Baltimore Ravens for left tackle in 2009. Writer/Director John Lee Hancock is admirable in bringing Michael's true story to the big screen that was much better than expected and it left me feeling entertained from beginning to end. It has a compelling coming of age story with a nice balance between drama and humor. Sandra Bullock turns in one of her best performances as Leigh Ann Tuohy and I for one believe she deserved the Oscar she won for the role. She's proved in every movie despite it's flaws her talent as an actress and this one is no different. Bullock plays Leigh Ann who through an act of kindness takes in a homeless teenage African-American, named Michael ""Big Mike"" Oher played effectively by Quinton Aaron. I haven't seen him anything before but I thought Aaron was equally impressive as Michael a poor teenager looking for something he's never had before; a family. Bullock, Aaron, and the rest of the cast had nice chemistry with each other on screen making their growing friendships believable. Tim McGraw turned in a solid performance as Leigh's husband Sean who becomes a surrogate father to Michael. I haven't seen McGraw in too many movies either but he still gives a good performance none the less. The rest of the cast including Lily Collins as Leigh's daughter Collins, Ray McKinnon, and Kim Dickens are effective as the supporting characters. Jae Head as Leighs son S.J. was the stand out who like the rest of his family forms an unbreakable bond with Michael. Jae Head impressed me with his performance whether it was acting like a drill sergeant while training Michael or demanding full access to him while he's in college. He provides the film with some great comic relief and his dialog delivery makes it that much funnier. He also had genuine chemistry with Aaron (Bullock, McGraw, and Collins) in their scenes together. Well done. Kathy Bates shows up in a small role as Mike's tutor Miss Sue and she does what her brief part requires. I heard this film was good but it surpassed by expectations. Besides some characters who aren't really developed (Bates) and a few predictable moments. Overall the good more than outweighed the bad because I enjoyed The Blind Side. I became invested in the main characters and the story which made the 128 minutes running time move at a steady pace. The moments of humor are executed perfectly mostly from Jae Head's great comic timing. I'll admit I wasn't expecting much but after watching this I can see why many people including critics liked it. If you're in the mood for an inspirational true to life story with drama, humor, and solid performances by the cast (Sandra Bullock, Quinton Aaron, and especially Jae Head), you can't go wrong with the Blind Side. It has everything you could ever want and expect from one of this films. Give the Blind Side a chance. It was much better than anticipated.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing movie about people that willingly take poor kid that came from bad neighborhood and help him rise to the stars.,"Uaaaau, to be honest this is one of the best movies i have ever seen. At the beginning I thought it is going to be boring movie, but this movie amazed me. Not just the movie whole story was just great. And whats even better is that it is true story. I just cant believe that something like this really happened. And the thing that I never heard of this movie before I came to U.S.. I don't have enough words to describe it, but I know that that men is my idol. And I am going to read book too. This story woke up feelings in me while i was watching it. I can't say its simple the best movie ever, because its not simple at all. This movie has one of the nicest stories behind him and that's the part that is so amazing. That is all i can say about this movie. If you ask me I would tell you that if you didn't watch the movie do it right now and if you did, do it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent Movie,"This is a true story about Michael Oher the offensive tackle player for the Baltimore Ravens. The movie tells you that Michael Oher was practically homeless when he meets Leigh Tuohy who in the movie is played by Sandra Bullock. In this movie, Sandra Bullock is a wealthy white women trying to help this poor black kid because she saw him walking in the rain and finds out he's homeless. Sandra learns later that he doesn't know his father and his mother is a drug addict.Later, Sandra realizes that Michael has an interest in football and she does everything in her power to make sure he's successful. Michael needed a lot of help with confidence and education. Sandra motivated him and hired a tutor. Michael later goes on to win The NCAA Division I athletic scholarship and is now a professional football player.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Terrible; Not worth a Penny,"This movie was terrible. Nothing about this movie was appealing, and the only reason i saw it was because i was forced too. Thank god i did not pay to see this in the theaters, because i don't think i would have made it through it. The only great part about this movie was Sandra Bullock's acting. DO NOT SEE! The story was OK, but it was poorly executed and poorly acted. The humor just made the movie laughable, which brought it along to its end. If you are in to these movies, see it. But if you are a person who enjoys a GOOD movie, i would not suggest it. This was not a very good movie to live up to the true story. This movie was made to evoke emotion, and it did slightly, but nothing like it should have or could have. This movie was not enjoyable. I would not recommend it.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Movie of the Decade,"This is without a doubt the 'Movie of the Decade.' A biographic story of real people beautifully told, absolutely inspiring and a testament to the the human soul. This movie inspires you to seek more information, via You Tube, and then this beautiful true story is revealed. The world of fantasy has produced an Epic. I tried to upload this affirmation, and was unsuccessful, so I will rabbit on a little. I found it absolutely refreshing that there was a glimmer of hope in America. All the story's of racism in America mostly told in movies and media are paled in significance by this real story. Congratulations to Michael Oher, Leigh Anne Tuohy and her beautiful family, for this inspirational true story.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastic,"Was Lucky Enough to go to a screener of this film.I have to say I went in like the previous review not expecting much at all. Sandra Bullock has never grabbed me as being a terrific actress, but she pulls this of amazingly.The first 5 minutes of the film I was still a little worried, but then bang I was grabbed. The connection to the characters was fantastic and from start to finish you went through all the emotions that I believe were intended. The balance of the humour was great.I recommend this film, it isn't an all time great but I came out feeling great.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A super film about as many -isms as you can fit,"I have watched this film four times now and it still moves me in all the right ways in all the right places. I am not a great fan of American Football and yet it doesn't matter one jot because this movie is so much deeper and profound than any sport could be.It is real life peeled away, layer by layer, just as the screenplay says it should. It doesn't attack anything by exaggeration, dramatic effect, or overstatement, it simply plays it out richly and simply through good, honest acting from a good, honest cast and a good, honest story.The film is brave enough to lay bear the counter arguments about ""agendas"" hidden within its own story and expose our own doubts, fears, presumptions and prejudices.I adore Sandra Bullock and I am pleased for her she found such a wonderful part to truly demonstrate her capacity for her art: an Oscar seems scant reward for such a wonderfully inspiring piece of drama. And the support is truly wonderful too.Go see this movie if you want to leave a theatre with a good feeling in your gut despite ""the warts and all"" you go through in its two hours or so.We can all change something even if it is only ourselves.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Non-stop Hallmark card, you'll love every moment","This movie was perfect. I loved it.It was completely predictable. I mean, every individual scene was predictable. And I always knew what the next scene would be. And eventually, there it would be, just as I expected. Nothing is surprising.But who cares? This movie really made me feel good from start to finish. I can sew why it ran and ran in theaters for so long. Sandra Bullock really earned that Oscar. She was great to watch.I was mildly annoyed that the Oher character (ya know, the main guy in the movie, and all) rarely put two words together. I know he's supposed to be simple, but I thought he must've talked more than that in real life.This is like a long Hallmark card. But it doesn't make you sick; you love every moment of it. A week later I'm still replaying scenes in my mind.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"well meant probably, but racist crap all the same","What is wrong with American Cinema lately? In the old days there would have been drama, passion and suspense in a story like this, today its just goodness all around. That probably makes for a better world, but sadly enough adds up to a rather boring night at the movies. This film has nothing to tell, apart from how great the white American upper middle class is, and I find it surprising that even people in America should be interested in such blatant propaganda. So you might argue, that this tells a true story, but if the story had been that dull to begin with, they either should have put some excitement in it or made a film about my next door neighbor, who's done nothing out of the extraordinary, but who's life is by all accounts more interesting than that of Michael Oher, if this film is anything to go by. But what really pisses me off is the thinly disguised racism that seeps in halfway through. So this big, black kid gets adopted by these nice white folks, who never fight, never have any arguments whatsoever. The big black kid wants a driving license, he gets a driving license, and you know what, because our nice rich white family is so generous, they buy him a pick up truck to go along with it. So he takes their little white son for a drive around the block and crashes the car big time, but do our white parents so much as bat an eyelid and feel any resentment against the big black kid. On the contrary, they are apparently very grateful as he selflessly prevented the son from being injured more severely. Surprisingly enough, no one in this family has ever any issues with this traumatized, rather morose black fellow moving in on short notice. In fact, both kids are rather fond of him straight away. Whatever happened to Douglas Sirk? He could have turned this story around. With John Lee Hanncock it's utterly hopeless. There is just no conflict whatsoever. Everyone gets along like a house on fire. Wait, wait, I forgot, there is Michael's mother (black) who comes across as rather irresponsible and Michael's old buddies (black) who are portrayed as violent, lazy and rude. But as Michael doesn't feel any ties to neither of them, everything would be fine, if it wasn't for an investigator form the National Collegiate Athletic Association (black, what a surprise) who suspects that Michael has been forced to chose a certain University for his career as a football pro. Do you care? We neither do I. The more since American Football must be one of the most boring sports and I wish they would stop making films about this folly.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Chances....... look for it,"This movie is all about 'life'. Yes it contains story surrounding as a emotions,funny moments,football etc but the message is clear - everybody needs a 'chance'- to find out who they are and what they are capable of. As in the movie Michael get the chance to prove himself not only as a football player but also as a decent family guy. And the Tuohy family family get a chance to find a new meaning of life and family through Michael. Actually we need to pick our chances to go to a whole new phase of our life and if we do able to pick those chances who knows what is waiting for us.The story of this film is great with great combination of star cast along with great direction. Everyone played their part at their best and especially Sandra bullock - she extremely natural to her character - excellent work by Sandra, hats off to her.Go and watch this film and took your family with you - believe me you will going to enjoy every piece of this extremely well made this movie which I can bet.Have fun .....and don't forget to look for 'chances'.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

This is the kind of gratitude they receive.,"I watched this movie, Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for Best Actress for it. According to the plot, a white family takes a black man from the slums under their wing and he becomes a professional football player. Since the movie is based on real events, I decided to find out what is fiction and what is not. So, a white family really did take care of a troubled black man, Michael Oher, provided him with housing, food, etc. They hired him a tutor who worked with him 20 hours a week, which allowed him to go to college on a budget basis. There he showed himself to be a good football player and as a result, in 2009, he signed a five-year contract with the Baltimore Ravens for $13.8 million. He won the Super Bowl and became the best player. Five years later, he played for the Tennessee Titans for a year and earned another $5 million. And another two years for the Carolina Panthers for $7 million. At the same time, the adoptive parents earned $700,000 from the book and its film adaptation. Everything seems to be fine and everyone should be happy, but in 2023, a black man filed a lawsuit against the adoptive parents and accused them of enriching themselves at his expense since he did not earn anything from the book and film. By court order, guardianship was terminated and the parents paid him $138,000. This is the kind of gratitude they receive.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Feel Good Movie,"I'm not a movie buff but this one tops all the movies I've seen in a while. It stars Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne Tuohy, Tim McGraw as Sean Tuohy, Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher, the main character, and the son of Leigh Anne and Sean and Jae Head as SJ. The movie has a great plot filled with caring individuals who although come from different cultures, showed lots of care for each other. Leigh Anne during many moments of disappointment never stopped caring nor expressed any negative judgment for Michael and neither did her family. Throughout the movie many social issues were touched making the viewers uncomfortable at times but handled very well by all the actors. There were scenes of anger, happiness, sadness,compassion, and greed. Surprise visits of famous sports figureheads were enjoyable throughout the film as well. It's nice to see a movie once in a while that touches the heart by showing that people in today's society still care. I would put this movie in the category with the ""The Green Mile"". A story about the lives of guards on death row leading up to the execution of black man accused of child murder & rape, who has the power of faith healing and a gentle giant,played by Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey. It is obvious that Bullock, McGraw and Aaron are the leading roles in this movie but Jae Head, SJ, the son hits a home run on this one. His role was quite entertaining as he takes in Michael ""Big Mike"" as his brother, trainee,and best friend and never gives up on him. I felt this movie was good for the entire family to enjoy with great acting and a good plot from the beginning to end. This was my second time seeing the movie and just like the first time I enjoyed it and was not bored. Each segment of the movie played a significant role in the plot and if altered would have had a profound effect on the movie as a whole. The Cinematographers,Directors and Producers set the lighting just right from scene to scene to capture your attention during the moment. A great example is during the football game scene where things were not looking so good for ""Big Mike"", the producers lowered the lights to give the viewer a since of feeling alone with Mike as he filled the screen with his massive size. Most of the scenes were shot from a wide angle to capture Big Mike as well because of his size.This was an absolutely delightful, heart-warming, ""happy-ending"" story. It reminded me of the good-side of humankind for a change. A great feel good movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"AMAZING Sandra Bullock, inspiring story","First off, Sandra Bullock is just mind-blowing. There simply could not have been a better actress to play this role, so the casting was spot on. But she's not just right for the part, the acting itself was simply amazing. She was genuine, funny, gentle yet brave and strict. Simply amazing. Ms Bullock, if you are reading this: thank you. You are truly inspiring! You are talented and all your feel-good movies really do make us all feel good, no matter what the nay-sayers say! Now, back on the movie. It was simply wonderful! The story is truly inspiring. I've read quite a few comments which called this movies things like awful. Nosir, this movie is a must-see. It's kind, original, funny, family-like and inspiring. It preaches all the things that a real person should appreciate: family, kindness to others, hard work and education, sports, understanding and, well, color-blindness. I simply loved it. I watched it once myself and once more with me wife, who was WOWed by it as well. I can not recommended it more!P.S. It's funny how nowadays people can rate some zombie-movie 10, but they rate a movie like this low. Why? Because it's not cool to be kind to others? Because it's not cool to see a movie about family and school? I mean, I honestly don't understand what is wrong with the world today :/ P.P.S. And I love and respect Sandra Bullock for all her comedy movies. They help a lot of people feel good, especially at this economic times. There is NOTHING wrong with silly movies and comedies.

Worst Best Picture Nom ever.,"In a world (called Memphis) where all of the white men are either lay-abouts or ineffectual idiots and all of the non-white people are some combination of drug addicts, thugs, and genetically good at sports there came White Woman to the rescue! When the local high school football coach is not able to provoke sufficient violence from his players, who steps in? -- White Woman! When this same coach stupidly calls sophisticated passing plays when he should be calling jam-it-down-their-throats running plays, who steps in? -- White Woman! When a African-American teenager has thighs and a rear-end wide enough to make him an stand-out football player, who invites him into her house and coerces him to play for her alma mater? - White Woman! With her sidekick White Tutor Woman, see White Woman modernize the local child welfare office, see her decorate her clients' house in a manner she likes despite what they may want, see her browbeat teachers into giving grades sufficiently high enough so her adopted son can play football at her alma mater without her having to pay the tuition! Suffice to say the longer you sit through this mess (and long you will sit through many sports montages which would have felt clichéd back in the late 80s) the more offended you should be no matter what your demographic categories you mark on your U.S. Census form. Professional football where careers last approximately 3 or 4 seasons on average and only lucky players are able to walk without pain between their ""retirement"" and their often premature deaths is held out as the only form of success for African-Americans born on the wrong side of Memphis. The white men in the film played with that ""yes, of course, honey"" slack-jawed sitcom Dad cowering perpetuates a burgeoning stereotype of its own. Finally, white woman should be offended that the comely Sandra Bullock won the Academy Award for dressing up and doing something of a southern accent over the less attractive but exceedingly more difficult role of Julia Child that Meryl Streep absolutely nailed in ""Julie & Julia"".

The Blind Side (2009) - A True Inspirational Feel-Good Story!,"Sandra Bullock stars in one of this year's critically acclaimed feature films. ""The Blind Side"" starts when a lonely African-American teenager named Michael Oher, after being separated from his drug-addicted mother, is spotted by Leigh Anne Tuohy, a tough and caring woman who brings him into her family. Throughout the rest of the movie, it's one scene of pure perfection after another. ""The Blind Side"" improves too easily in such a brilliant way. Writer-director John Lee Hancock makes a pretty good job of taking the true story of one man, and how his whole life changes with a new family. The cast of this movie is superb from Quinton Aaron to Tim McGraw, but it's Sandra Bullock who stole the entire show, with her excellent charisma, charm, confidence, strictness, comedic timing, and perfect skill, and she totally deserves her Oscar win. Every moment you either laugh, cry, or feel pain, which is why this movie affects all audiences. ""The Blind Side"" is easily one of the best movies of the year, and it's a perfect choice to be nominated for Best Picture, because it's a feel-good heartwarming drama that tugs into the heartstrings.

Is this Sandra Bullock's best performance of her acting career? Check out my review below to find out!,"""The Blind Side"" (2009), I remember the first time I saw this movie, I was in the tenth grade at the time. Usually, most films that they make you watch in school are mediocre at best. However, there are a few rare ones that stand out as being incredible. ""The Blind Side"" is easily one of the best movies I've seen during my high school years. On top of that, this film gives us, in my opinion, Sandra Bullock's best acting performance. I'll go into more details about her in a moment. Any way, I really love this movie, which I did not expect to happen when I first saw it! Every time I watch it, I enjoy it more and more. ""The Blind Side"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, beautiful sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it all together. The plot of this film is actually based off a true real-life story. A teenager named Michael Oher has a dream of becoming a professional football player. With the help of his new adoptive parents, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy, he works to overcome his impoverished upbringing. As most of you know, I'm always a bit iffy about movies based on real-life stories or events. If they are able to do justice to the material, then I'm game to watch it! Not only did they knock it out of the park with the storyline, it's also one of the most inspirational and heartwarming storylines, both in this film, and the real-life event it's based off of as well! I won't go into any details regarding the plot. But, I can assure you, that it's a story that you'll remember for the rest of your life. As for the acting, it's phenomenal from the entire cast. All of them nail their characters! However, the shining star in this movie, is Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne Tuohy. Now, a lot of you all know that I'm not the biggest fan of Sandra Bullock as far as acting goes, she's a much better film maker overall. That being said, she does have a few decent acting performances here and there, and her performance in this film is by far her best. It wasn't until a couple of days ago that I found out she had won the Academy Award for Best Actress. After watching this movie multiple times beforehand, that doesn't surprise me. Normally, I don't like to judge movies based on accolades. But, Sandra Bullock definitely deserved to win that Academy Award, for sure! Every other cast member does such an amazing job as well. Quinton Aaron is also on-point (no pun intended) with his performance as Michael Oher. His adoptive relationship with Sandra Bullock is such a treasure to watch. And to think, this storyline actually happened in real-life! It just reminds us that there is still good left in this world. It'll always be out there to find. The rest of the cast nail their characters as well. Their chemistry on the screen is nothing short of impeccable! All of the sets/locations are fantastic and give the film a beautiful atmosphere. You can't go wrong with filming your movie in Georgia, or anywhere in the southeastern United States! As far as the special effects go, they are perfect and still hold up today. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Carter Burwell is outstanding. His film score really helps bring this movie to life, and gives it that extra heart and soul. Props to you, Carter Burwell! ""The Blind Side"" is an amazing sports drama movie. It also found a spot on my top ten all-time favorite sports films! Yes, I do think it's that good. I can watch it over and over and never get tired of it. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen this movie, what are you waiting for? Go see it today! But, before you do, I highly recommend that you look up the actual real-life story that this film is based on. It'll make the movie that much more enjoyable to watch. Go watch ""The Blind Side"", I personally guarantee that you'll love it. If you don't see it, then prepare yourself to be tackled!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not  Just Another Football Movie,"In 2009, The Blind Side was directed into a film after being published as a novel in 2006. After reading the spectacular biography of Michael Oher and watching the movie, the two were surprisingly very similar. In both the novel and the movie, the story begins with a football injury that ended a great player's career. This provides a smooth transition and a glimpse of how football affected the life of Michael Oher. Along with football, the loving Tuohy family completely turned Michael's life around. The film successfully created scenes and images into real life that were previously demonstrated in the novel. The anticipated movie emotionally affected many of those who watched it and exceeded all expectations.While growing up, Michael was abandoned by his parents, leaving him to survive on his own. As each day passed, he struggled to find a place to sleep and literally was forced to sleep on the streets. On one rainy night, Michael was walking down a dark street with his belongings after leaving a local volleyball game. Fortunately, the Tuohy family, who happened to be extremely wealthy, suspiciously drove by him wondering where he was going. They soon realized his difficult situation, and offered to take care of him. Soon after, Michael became enrolled in one of the top private schools in the area thanks to the head football coach who sought after his athletic ability. S.J. Tuohy, the son, gives his best effort with transforming Michael into a football player, and seemed to have done a great job. Immediately into the football season, Michael began to receive scholarship offers from the top college football teams across the nation. The Tuohy's were alumni's of Ole Miss and contributed greatly to his decision in continuing his football career at this college.The movie contains many excellent actors that performed absolutely brilliantly at each of their roles. Sandra Bullock plays the role of Leigh Anne Tuohy, the mother, and could not have done better at portraying a loving mom who wanted the best for her family and Michael. By showing true emotions and constant protection, she was able to excel at her role in one of the best pieces of acting I have ever witnessed. In comparison with the mom, S.J. Tuohy, played by Jae Head, perfectly suited their character, and acted as if the movie were real life. Jae Head does remarkably at showing his true passion for the sport of football and his enjoyment in actually helping Michael. His constant smile helped show his passion in filming and the bright character of the young man. Along with Bullock and Head, Tim McGraw fitted perfectly as the father and the football coach acted great as a typical southern football fanatic. Each of these actors played their roles tremendously and contributed greatly to the success of The Blind Side. Before watching the movie, most people thought that this movie would have been only about football. However, the cinematography actually focuses the move on the struggling life of Michael Oher, and how the Tuohy's changed his life around. I thought the most memorable portion of the movie was when Michael first got connected and comfortable with the family. In these scenes, the filming emphasizes the emotions of Michael Oher and the mother and son and the beautiful scenery in the background. This allows the movie to touch the emotional side of the audience and become closer to each of the characters. The movie shows Michael's journey through the point of views of both Michael Oher and the Tuohy family. The cinematography helped establish a closer connection with the characters in the movie, and contributes to the audience's love for The Blind Side. Personally, The Blind Side was absolutely one of the most outstanding movies in all aspects. The story line was heartwarming, the acting was nothing short of pure brilliance, and the cinematography portrayed the perfect image throughout the entire journey. In my opinion, this film fell nothing short of perfection, and received all ten stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Power of The Blindside,"I have seen a few Sandra Bullock movies & this is the one that will allow her to get away from the title rom-com queen. This is the role that will change her career and make more people look at her as a well-rounded actress as well as the life and career of Quinton Aaron who plays the role of Michael Oher who even when he says nothing has such as look on his face and in his eyes that you want to feel for his character.I first assumed that this movie would be centred all about football but every chance it gets the story that makes you want to laugh and cry all at the same time creeps up on you and somehow you forget that this film is even a sports story, thats how strong the story and the performances by the actors/actress that has been placed on screen affects you. This is a film that I would pay any amount of money to see again & again as it pulls at your heartstrings.One event that happened last night made me realize this film's staying power in Hollywood. As we came out from another film we had seen , a lineup had formed outside a theatre, we figured it was for Avatar or something. Now this theatre has kept showing The Blindside even though this is a theatre that keeps films on there screens for a max of 3 weeks.

Love love love this movie,"I would give it a 20! The storytelling was superb. This could have been so sappy, but it was done with a realism. Characters were likable, admirable, and a reminder that there are heroes in real life. Totally safe to watch with children. I recommend that children on up watch it. But it isn't childish. So much humor, too. That's part of the storytelling. It could have been made pitiful. Instead, there was something joyful from the beginning. Yes, there was the sadness, the misery, the heartbreak. Somehow, that did not dominate. There was no psych delving into the all the badness, stirring up crushing emotions. There were decent people driven by a natural goodness and conscience that triumphed. Sandra Bullock deserved her Oscar for her performance. I bet her character lives in legend. Her husband, Tim McGraw was just fun. Don't miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Something refreshing,"As to young minds, this movie wasn't anything special; there was no action, no killing, actually, nothing worth watching. However, I'm not as most of the young minds, so I found something worth watching and giving 10 this movie.I've never been a fan of a long movies, but this movie made me think of that. Through whole movie, I haven't even notice how much passed; I was so focused on what's going on on screen rather than when the movie will finish. It takes a lot to impress me; I do not dwell in the corner where a little thing is most satisfying, rather where only things worth smiling to are smiled to. I must also say that I wasn't much of a fan of Sandra so far, but her acting in this movie was really amazing. What I like most is a plot. Plot was written almost perfectly, as plot should always be written, no matter what. It's a life drama, uncommon to the world because of the people's grief; however, it's refreshing to see that there are, out there, still people who fight for justice and who want to change the world.But, the best of all was Quinton Aaron. As an actor I've never heard of before, he really amazed me with his performance. Not just that it was stunning, but it was true; it was like he IS living the story - it was the way all actors should act. I've liked mix of comedy and drama, some scenes that shows us what life really is and yet some to show us that what we saw isn't totally true. Of course, all actors did their roles, but Sandra and Quinton as Anne and Michael did stunning job. I've never seen such a chemistry between two people that aren't in love, that aren't actually related to each other in any other way that just knowing each other, I like the moment when Michael says ""I don't like to be called Big Mike"" - it really shows how is he closed within himself - that nobody actually knew that he does not like to be called Big Mike. Or the moment he says ""I thought I'm already part of this family""It is really hard to put some scenes before others because I think that movie wouldn't be what is without every scene in it.Hopefully I did not spoil anything. And, I actually don't understand why does this movie have such a low rating - yes, 7.6 is low. It is much better than Dark Knight, Ineception or whatever. Looks like people prefer fantasy and crime above truth and reality. And we wonder why are we at place we are.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A truly inspirational and heartwarming true story.,"The Blind Side stars Sandra Bullock as mum Leigh Anne Tuohy and her husband Sean Tuohy played by Tim McGraw who take in a young black lad Michael Oher played by Quinton Aaron who lives in a rundown neighbourhood with his mum whose is on drugs and he himself who struggles at school but is great at sports. Leigh and Sean spot Quinton out at night in the rain and take him in. Here he gets a better life as the Tuohy's live in a large house and end up treating him like their own son with the mother of Michael who lets her son go. From here the Tuohy's encourage Micheal to be more confident in himself and help him improve his grades at school and encourage him to pursue American football as he wants to enter the NFL professionally.This is similar to Clint Eastwood's Invictus of telling a true story and being inspirational, the difference is there wasn't enough for me with Invictus, but The Blind Side is a different story. My dad took me to see this at the cinema and I wasn't expecting to like it much, but I kept an open mind and settled in my seat with my popcorn and drink and within fifteen minutes I was engrossed so much I forgot I had popcorn or that I was even at the cinema! This is the movie Invictus should have been. The viewer is taken on a fascinating journey of love, sadness and inspiration. Sandra Bullock for me has always been a good actress but one that never really stood out from the crowd, but she deserved her Oscar for this. Her acting was absolutely outstanding, it was nothing short of sensational, other actors like Tim McGraw and Kathy Bates as Michael's home tutor give good support and Quinton Aaron, though he dosen't speak much, he had a child-like innocence and charm that won me over.I was kept gripped by the whole 130 minutes of this movie and at the end it was one of those rare movies that I hated to see end. I could have happily sat there for another hour watching it. In the end this was a very inspirational and heartwarming true story that was excellently told and acted.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sarah Palin: the movie,"America is a pretty good country. We are at once progressive and compassionate. We have an elected president who is not just a man of color, but also highly intelligent and supremely wise. Christ, not even the snooty British or other so-called inclusive European countries- who often rebuke our American character and psychology- can lay claim to such an awesome achievement.While I am proud to be an American, I'm not too proud to have ""The Blind Side"" be our movie phenomena of the year. This is not cool. What has been created here is an insipid drama that insults audience intelligence. Not only that, it's ineffably racist and poorly dramatized.Firstly, if I was a black guy I would seriously be insulted by this movie. The character of Michael Oher is little more than a modern reworking of Uncle Tom; while the nice white middle-class suburbanite characters pity his appalling ghetto poverty and nasty urban community whom peddle drugs, take drug or vilify nice white people who are trying to protect them from fooling with drugs and guns. There is not one character of color that can be regarded as three-dimensional. For that matter, there's not even one white character in this movie that's three-dimensional. Everything about this movie: from themes, characters and politics- is lowest-denominator.The plot is totally by the numbers. I didn't know much about this film before watching it, but 5 minutes in I knew where it was going. I knew all the conflicts that were going to pop up and how effortlessly they'd be overcome. I knew there'd be no real character arc for Leigh Anne Tuohy, and the dramatic growth of Michael Oher's character was without any sort of surprise. It was simplistic in every way.I read somewhere on in the comments pages that this was Sandra Bullock's 'masterpiece'. I beg to disagree. Ms. Bullock has yet to make a masterpiece, or deliver a performance that can be deemed masterful. (That's not saying she isn't a good actress or not pretty, because she is: very much so.) For that matter, hasn't Kathy Bates played the exact same role in her last 17 movies? Talk about type casting. Furthermore, the kid playing S.J. was the most annoying child depicted in film. He sucked. I wanted him to get written-off in the car crash scene.This is a bad movie. One that doesn't deserve to be as huge as what it's become.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

Also here is the meaning of the word ""family"".In this day and age family values have been diluted and in many places of the world no longer exist. Their are a lot of lonely people in the world that have not had the benefit of a wholesome upbringing.

Sandra Bullock owns this role,"Who was to know that #74 for the Baltimore Ravens Michael Oher had a history like this. I didn't even know that this movie was about his life and his adoptive family the Touhys till i saw it. What a movie it is very inspirational and a must see for any poor street kids out there that would rather spend the time making something out of themselves then spend the time planning drive bis with their posse. Michael Oher's parents were definitely not the Cleavers his mother a crack addict and mother of 12 children and his father an inmate at a local penitentiary who he was taken from at a very young age by children's services during a police raid on his home went through ( to put it mildly) a few years of hell until interior designer Leigh Anne Touhy on one freezing thanksgiving night find Michael walking to find shelter in only a t shirt in freezing cold weather offer their home and to share thanksgiving dinner with them, eventually taking him and adopting him. They give Michael all the warmth and care of a family that he so longed for and end up signing him up for football. That starts what is now after the 2009 entry draft into the NFL,l history. We need more people and stories like his out there the world would be a much better place! It would be nice to see Sandra Bullock who actually became Leigh Anne Touhy during this film to win the Oscar it would be her first if she does.

This Movie was EXCELLENT!!!!,"When I saw this preview I was like oh, this looks good. Then after awhile I lost interest and I didn't want to see it. I decided to go see it. This movie was probably one of the best dramas I have seen. I left the theater heart-warmed and inspired.The message is good and the movie is pretty clean. It's heavy at times but has a great story and will make you want to do great things. The acting was also very good. Sandra Bullock did an awesome job playing a semi-serious role after starring in ""The Proposal"" and ""All About Steve."" Tim McGraw played the husband and also did a good job. This movie is appropriate for most audiences but it depends on how well you know your kids. I recommend this movie to everyone because even if it doesn't look like your kind of movie, you will get something out of it. I was happy that Sandra Bullock received Best Actress In A Drama for ""The Blind Side"" but didn't see how Avatar was a drama and beat The Blind Side and how the Blind Side wasn't even nominated for Best Drama but was relieved that she still received Best Actress. Just because a film doesn't make millions upon millions of dollars in the box office doesn't mean it's not a good film. So I say you need to see this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The movie illustrates what can happen when someone is given a chance in life by others,"(Synopsis) ""The Blind Side"" is based on the remarkable true story of Baltimore Ravens offensive left tackle Michael Oher played by Quinton Aaron. Michael grew up in the inner city housing projects with his mother in Memphis, Tennessee aptly named ""Hurt Village"". Michael's story begins with him being homeless and coming from a broken home with a drug-addicted mother, and an absentee father. Because of his family circumstances, Family Services took control of his life as he was growing up. Unfortunately, he was being bounced around in and out of foster homes, and now as a teenager he has taken it upon himself that he would rather be homeless. By a stroke of luck, and the coach's wish for a player the size of Michael, he ends up enrolling in a private Christian school where the Tuohy kids go. Michael is a quiet person who is befriended by S.J. Tuohy (Jae Head), the youngest Tuohy who's connection to Michael starts the ball rolling. One icy winter night, as Michael is walking down the road to the school gym, where he is sleeping, Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) with her husband and kids pick Michael up and take him home. Michael is taken in and is accepted by the Tuohy family who wants to help him fulfill his great potential. The teenager faces a new set of challenges that he and his newly adopted family must overcome.(My Comment) Overall, this is one very good inspirational movie that is a must see. You will learn why the left tackle is so important in preventing quarterbacks from getting hit from their blindside. You will also know that this is a success story going into the movie, but it will still be satisfying to you to see the successes that Michael discovers along the way. The movie is so incredible and charming that everyone will be able to relate and feel connected to the characters. The film has humor, heart, compassion, and reality all rolled into one. It is simply amazing how life is an unknown. Leigh Ann takes Michael home to sleep on their sofa for one night, which turns into a week, and eventually becomes a legal adoption. Sandra Bullock, Quinton Aaron, and the entire cast did a wonderful job of delivering a believable performance. The movie shows a touching illustration of what can happen when someone is given a chance in life by others. This movie will be recognized at Oscar time.

The whole story is a LIE,"While I am proud of Mr. Michael Oher for everything he accomplished while in the care of Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy, it sickens me to find out 14 years after this film's release (and probably as many years after I read the book by Michael Lewis, the Tuohy's book, and Mr. Here's) that he never got adopted, but rather was tricked into a conservatorship by 2 greedy, UNCHRISTIAN phonies! (Source: the ESPN app) I'm just thankful that He's finally going to get the royalties he deserves. And I sincerely hope and pray that all of his fans give the Tuohys some much needed backlash and go to Leigh Anne's website (the comment page) to issue a very strong rebuke for their behavior. Because of this, I for one will NEVER watch this movie again!",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Love and Kindness,"The film I chose was The Blind Side based on a true story. Quinton Aaron who played Michael Oher was an All AMerican football player who stood out, Michael was a homeless child who got took in by the family of Sandra Bullock - Leigh Ann, Tim Mcgraw - Seam, following the children Jae Head- S. J., and lasty Lilly Collins, Collins and later becomes his legal family members. With the help of Ray McKinnon - Coach Cotton seeing his potential. Michael made it to the NFL. This movie had great editing, and the overall theme was stunning.This movie has great editing and with the credit from Mark Livolsi he did an amazing job gathering all the lighting together to make sure that nothing was too dark or light. The script went well with the scenes and background of the movie. The camera work is nice and clear, especially in a movie made in 2009. The characters were put in the correct angles so that the light was captured in the correct scenes. When it came to the music in the background there were some intense moments that brought in dramatic music and the calmer moments brought in peaceful music. The producer John Lee Hancock did not need much thinking to do plot wise because it was based on a true story.The theme I got from this movie was Love and kindness. I say this because when leigh Ann and Sean let Michael in their home as a kindness of their heart knowing they didn't have to, but they still did anyways. He got what he wanted and made it to the NFL with the help of the family following his dreams. Michael even had good sibling's aka leigh Ann and Sean kids, S. J. and Lilly Collins. Another time the theme went perfectly in his film was when S. J. went on a ride with Michael in his brand-new car, it was always love between the two, never a dull moment. Even after Michaels got S. J. in the car accident everybody still loved him the same way.Overall great movie especially being based off a true story. Michael had a great story to tell and a great family to back him up. I would give this movie a ten out of ten especially because it teaches you a lesson. Never let anyone feel abandoned, it is always good to take people in because you never know the goals, they have that they can reach but can't because there in the system feeling abandoned. Everyone needs love.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Pass the syrup,"As icky sweet as it is cliché-ridden, this real-life story of an unlikely mother and son proved devoid of any real tension. This is one of those premises that sounds too odd to be true on the page, but once on the screen doesn't go anywhere. Even the last-minute inquiries into the family's motivations for adopting Big Mike prove too little too late. As for Ms. Bullock, even her post-Oscar scandal seems more interesting than this slight narrative. Her performance here screams Kathy Lee Gifford on Lifetime, not Oscar winner. In fact, even Kathy Bates is in low gear here. Only the brilliant Adriane Lennox proves really memorable. Perhaps the young actor playing SJ had some moments, but they, too, seemed way to over-orchestrated and (ironically) lacking reality.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Fantastic movie,"This is one of the most entertaining and heartwarming movies. This movie uses real life situations and portray it accurately in movie form. This makes it skill-fully developed. John Lee Hancock took a true story and made it into a movie without leaving out major details. This then makes the movie truth-filled, as much as it could be to still make it into a short film, there was nothing major added that wasn't true, the main story remains truth-filled. It was also relevant to experience because it quite literally reenacts someones life experiences. It can also be relevant to how people feel when they grow up in poverty. Micheal Oar grew up in ghettos and experience gang violence and drugs on a daily basis, but it didn't hold him back from, the wholesome part of this movie also correlates with the dignity of the human person. The lessons that one can get from this movie should allow the viewers to put themselves in those shoes and feel what Micheal Oar might have felt, this can help to improve the dignity of the human person. This movie also gives the audience inspiration, to be the best version of yourself and not to let obstacles in life stop you from your end goal. This movie also provides a balance of comedy/entertainment and seriousness/truth. Lastly the attitude portrayed is a positive, headstrong, confident, and hardworking attitude to inspire the people who watch to never give up.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Curious Case of the Hollywood Treatment,"""The Blind Side"" isn't awful, as some critics are writing. It's also not terrific, as some viewers are saying. It's a mediocre movie with moments of greatness.As a Baltimore resident, I love to see the Ravens logo emblazoned on screen. Michael Ohers strikes me as both a respectable player and a respectable man. His story is an inspiring one; Ohers rose from poor circumstances and became a national figure. But this isn't the story you get when you put your $10 in the ticket slot, buy your buttery popcorn, and sit down in your sticky seat at the local cinema.""The Blind Side"" is essentially about a dumb, poor, black man who finds salvation at the hands of a sassy white woman. Clearly, this is not the story of Michael Ohers. I'm not accusing the Hollywood producers responsible for the film of racism, but rather of opportunism. They obviously decided that this sports story would be best served as a Sandra Bullock movie, complete with ""comedic"" stock characters and ""humorously"" ironic situations.These Bullock-pampering comic scenes are then juxtaposed with clearly exaggerated and dramatized serious scenes. The effect is an uneven dramedy with some thudding jokes and some unintentional laughs. Toby Keith and Kathy Bates don't bring much to the table as Bullock's husband and Michael's teacher. However, the film doesn't completely collapse.Sandra Bullock gives one of the best performances of her career. With a game Southern accent and a tough-as-nails attitude, she turns a stereotype into a flesh-and-blood character. Her comedic timing has always been good, and it works especially well here. At the same time, she brings gravitas to her character's more trying moments. Bullock carries the film. While her character's role in Ohers' life is overplayed, her work saves the film from the ""DUD"" label.Some of the comedy falls flat, Ohers comes off as a wholly dependent idiot, and the film's realism is shaky at times. Still, it's worth seeing the film for Bullock's performance.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
My Review- Blind Side,"The Blind Side played by Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher, Sandra Bullock as Leigh Ann Tuohy, Tim McGraw as Sean Tuohy and Kathy Bates as Michael's tutor Miss Sue, is a true life film about a young man who had all the odds against him. Michael Oher grew up not knowing his father, and living with a crack head mother. As a young child Michael is taken from his mother only to have to learn how to manage through life on his own. Michael meets the Tuohy's and his life takes a change for the good. Leigh Ann Tuohy, has a heart of gold, and decides to take Michael in as one of her own. This movie shows us that even when the odds are against us, we can overcome the adversities of our lives. This movie was well written and shows one man's struggles and the triumph he received because of one families love for him. This is not your ordinary football movie. This movie is one man's story from poverty and despair to a life of greatness on the field. Michael Oher started out with a less than average education level to becoming a great wide receiver. Leigh Ann Tuohy, a mother of two decides to take in a strange boy who had no one else in his corner. She shows him love and provides him the same benefits she gives her children. Michael for so many years had been passed along in school with no one really caring or showing an interest in him. From the lighting in this movie to the sounds, you get the feel for being at the game. This movie reminds you much of Remember the Titans, where a team faces all types of adversities only to triumph in the end.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The Blind Side is a family movie about love, perseverance and honor.","The Blind Side is a true life film about a young black man, wonderfully played by Quinton Aaron. This man, Michael Oher was born into a difficult family situation but today, lives a life polar opposite of the one he could have ended up living. This is all due to the love and compassion of one woman; Leigh Ann Tuohy brilliantly played by Sandra Bullock. Sean Tuohy is played by Tim McGraw and Miss Sue, Michaels tutor, is played by Kathy Bates. Considering that Michael Oher was born in a rough part of Memphis Tn., his mother is a drug addict and his father is absent it seems that Michael has all opportunities to become like so many of his neighborhood friends. Michael could do drugs, steal, and/or become a gang member. There is something in Michael that pulls him away from that sort of lifestyle. Michael has perseverance and honor. He keeps trying to ""do life"" on his own; sleeping where he can, and doing laundry on someone else's dime, until someone comes along and gives him a better opportunity to do something with his life. Michael has honor and protective instincts he honors his mother no matter how bad her choice of lifestyle is. She is still his mother and he wants to be with her. He wants to protect her. Leigh Ann is very compassionate when she meets Michael's biological mother. She feels her pain as well as she can considering their opposite lifestyles. Michael continued his education in the home of the Tuohy's. When he got there, his GPA was barely on the scale; when he left the Tuohy's home, it was because he had worked so hard (with the help of Miss Sue) and received a scholarship to Ole Miss. Kathy Bates is wonderful as his tutor. The Blind Side is similar to ""Remember the Titans"" starring Denzel Washington, in the fact that they are both based on true stories about young men, football and racism. When you watch The Blind Side, you will feel like you are right there in Michael's head when he has flashbacks regarding the day he was taken from his mother. Even though the scene around him is total chaos like when he goes back to his old neighborhood and gets in a scuffle with one of his acquaintances. They pull back in the scene so that you can see Michael among all of the chaos just after the scuffle and then see his memories of being ripped from his mothers grasp. In the present scene, the screams of the women and children enhance his despair and the sounds of their cries demonstrate what he is going through in his flashback. This movie is proof positive that even if you are born into diverse conditions that if you have perseverance, honor and courage that you can change your destiny.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Bad Movie,"Rating: 4.8
Overall, a movie that's only saving grace is a memorable performance from Sandra Bullock as it is poorly acted, directed, and written with it overall playing like a Hallmark movie, and this is without taking into consideration the allegations about how truthful the story is.Pretty Bad Direction (The movie is told like a Hallmark movie as it is incredibly feel-good and uses a pretty safe style to tell the story; the macro and micro scenes are just bland overall (not all of them though); he does not lift the actors as it feels like Sandra Bullock is the only one really acting and it is hard for others to work off of her), Pretty Bad Acting (Very Good from Sandra Bullock (Commands her scenes very well and does a very good job in helping move the story forward; she really does not go above and beyond in any way with this role as it is written really poorly (but she does the best with what she is given); tries her best to pull the actors around her but the talent mismatch makes it hard for her to have chemistry), Decent from Tim McGraw (A very unmemorable performance as nothing stands out as being good or bad), Bad from Quinton Aaron (Has no emotion in any of his scenes and does not work well with the other actors at all (which is a shame considering he is the subject matter)), Good from Kathy Bates (Really pulls from experience playing other characters as it feels like she did not prep at all for this role), Bad from the rest of the cast (Just very bland/inexperiences performances all around (does not include the child actors though))), Pretty Bad Story (The story is just very feel good (but it is interesting overall); the character development is probably the best part of the story (but it is a bit formulaic and predictable); the story elements had some interesting parts (especially the recruiting aspects), but the plot construction just falls apart (especially towards the end); the biggest issue with this movie is its historical accuracy as it takes many liberties from deviating from the truth to make the Tuohy seem a lot better than they are and Michael a lot more helpless than he is), Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is just so cringey and cliche that so many lines were predictable (it's like it was written by someone who writes for the Lifetime channel); there were some jokes that were somewhat funny but it is just very cringey for the most part; the symbolism is incredibly shallow and pretty overt; the foreshadowing is pretty nonexistent as the movie is just very linear and predictable about what is gonna happen next), Pretty Bad to Decent Score, Decent Cinematography (Best moments are during the football scenes but it is still not the best), Decent Sound (Only worth mentioning due to the football tackles), Pretty Bad Editing (The opening editing scenes felt like it was edited on movie maker as it was so amateur that it left a sour tone of what the rest of the movie would be), Plot Structure was not that well constructed as it spends way too much time on the exposition and the resolution is way longer than it needs to be, Pacing was fine but it just felt like many scenes were leading to nowhere; the final 20 minutes of the movie could have been cut as it is irrelevant to the story (and makes the family look worse given the current allegations), Climax was poorly executed as it just felt unnecessary and dramatized, Tone was incredibly feel-good and plays like a Hallmark movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

You can't watch a horror movie and then complain that it was not as funny as a comedy, because they're completely different genres. Without Hollywood appeal the movie would not have received half the attention it got. In fact, without Hollywood appeal, great Hollywood movies would not be great Hollywood movies.

"Easily the best family movie of 2009, aspiring, inspiring, assuredly transpires hopeful human connections against all odds and social cynicism","Sandra Bullock is ever so enjoyable to watch in her movies, and I've been attracted to her star power since ""While You Were Sleeping""1995 director Jon Turteltaub's heartwarming tale with Bill Pullman & the ensemble family, and ""Speed"" 1994 director Jan De Bont's action ace with Keanu Reeves. Her movies, mostly more 'commercial' and Hollywood, do have their mass appeal. Once in awhile, she gets to play more 'in-depth' roles, like part of the ensemble cast in w-d Paul Haggis' ""Crash"" 2004. In 2009, ""The Proposal"" is an amusingly fun 'rom-com' outing set in Sitka, Alaska, with Ryan Reynolds as the opposite force. But as Leigh Anne Tuohy, based on true (and current) story-events, in ""The Blind Side"" - she absolutely shines as she does, integrated and permeating with her own Sandra Bullock air (energy, oxygen) about her, without losing the essential characteristic qualities of Mrs. Tuohy.Whether she wins the 82nd Academy Awards Best Actress category is beside the point, ""The Blind Side"" is a well-produced movie directed by John Lee Hancock, who also wrote the script based on the story of Michael Oher in author Michael Lewis' best-selling book, ""The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game"". The production notes 'downloadable' from the film's official site ""theblindsidemovie.com/dvd/pdf/prodNotes.pdf"" is in itself an interesting read. We get to know how Lewis (who was high school pal with Sean Tuohy - Leigh Anne's husband) came to write the story about Oher, and he explained about 'left tackle'. Writer-director Hancock (whose family is very much connected with the game - his father and two brothers all played university football) talks about his perspectives, what he sees as the decisive factors in approaching the film. The fascinating casting process in filling the key roles: the Tuohy family of Leigh Anne the amazing Mom and assertive woman by Sandra Bullock, of Sean the supportive husband and Dad by Tim McGraw, of the caring & fun sister and brother team of Collins and S.J. by Lily Collins and Jae Head, and the surprising turn of finding Quinton Aaron to convincingly play Michael Oher. There's also the real life tutor role of Miss Sue neatly played by Kathy Bates. The producers' illuminating accounts about how the film project came to be and the fruition of the production sure complement the experience of the film. (They've also included some Leigh Anne Tuohy quotes from ""The Blind Side"".) Hancock, who gave us 'The Rookie' 2002 with Dennis Quaid, once again delivered a winning movie, full of human warmth and inspiring elements without being overly sentimental. See ""The Blind Side"" and you will hearken to the thankful feeling for what we so fortunately already have - miracle or blessings in disguise. Contentment is a nice place to be.Note: This film somehow reminds me of a (sports) documentary by filmmaker, writer-director Ward Serrill's ""The Heart of the Game"" 2005. It was seven years in the making, following a high school basketball team, one stellar central player especially - her trials and tribulations, along with the tenaciously talented coach through the course of the film. The real-life true story is quite 'melo-dramatic' (and tear-jerker sentimental) in spite of it being a documentary. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not just another uplifting sports movie,"I went into this movie expecting a made-for-TV style true story, with a bigger cast and inflated budget.I was spectacularly wrong.Without revealing too much, this movie is the true, uplifting story of Michael Oher. He is an overgrown, black, misunderstood young man who comes from a broken home. By chance he is accepted into a wealthy, predominately white, high school (due to his size and potential in football).From here we see the true challenge he faces. He struggles to find shelter and warmth at night and lives out of a plastic bag.Then begins his journey with the family of Sandra Bullock's character. In what is an outstanding performance, the best of her career, Bullock is believable and tough in portraying a woman of true strength and character.Overall, this movie is great, capped off by strong performances. It is almost difficult to believe it is a true story. The sporting plot plays second fiddle to the true plot - the racial and class divides in the Southern States of America.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Feel Good Movie of the Year,"The Blind Side is a film that shows the true definition of what it means to care for others, what it means to be a humanitarian, of what it means to show love. Sandra Bullock plays Leigh Ann Tuohy, a wife and a mother of 2 who is a part of a upper-middle class family. Leigh Ann decides that her family should take in a child from the projects who appears to be homeless and she, along with her family changes his life. Throughout the movie you get to see how the smallest acts of love and kindness can totally change someone's life. Leigh Ann is courageous, fearless, and determined to do whatever she can to make sure Big Mike, the homeless kid in them movie has a decent life. Throughout the movie you get to see not only how the Tuohy's change Big Mike's life but how he impacts their life. This film displays how important it is to do for others and it also proves that there are still good people in the world. This film shows the power of love and happiness in a way that light and fun; a must see family film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Death, Dumb and Blindsided","That is my experience with this misguided film. No problems no struggles, ask and you shall receive whether you earn your success or just handed it for no good reason. This film makes American Idol look like the ""Elvis"" story. Entitlements on steroids. Sandra Bullock's bad accented character has not sense of responsibility for protecting her family but instead becomes a proponent of correcting all of the social injustices of the world singlehandedly. Of course a few Erin Brocken. strategic moves succeed with flying colors. ""If you want to make fun of me, I can buy an overpriced lunch salad much closer to home"" she tells her weekly bridge group at lunch. Why would anyone want to be friends with this self righteous woman? And she brings an over-sized street kid into her home on a whim not knowing if he is a gang banger, perhaps a threat to her cheerleader daughter or perhaps endangering herself, her meek hub and her dwarf son. Van Jones would be proud of this, even if this wasn't an interracial story. Of course the obstacles are few and good in this movie triumphs over the ""It's a small world after all"" good in this film. She lives in a mansion, never seems to have a job except for being Mr. Blind Side's personal assistant and everybody loves her. She's like ""The New Kid In Town"" of Don Henley fame. Ladeda, Obla De Obla Da life goes on Blah, life is a ""bed of roses"". Success without hard work just find some rich lady who is bored and you won't even need Simon Cowell. Parents please tell your kids this movie is all a Hollywood Fantasy, and read with them for the 2 hours and 8 minutes you will waste on this bad use of silver oxide!

Good movie but it has its downsides.,"I enjoyed the movie, it is one of my all time favorites and i enjoyed how the characters interacted with people, Especially Leigh Ann who when someone would say a snarky comment she would bite back. I enjoyed S. J's character and how he playful his character seemed.Sean and Collins seemed pretty plain and when they were in a scene I either got bored or just ignored them outright even when they were talking. I enjoyed Miss Sue's character who seemed full of life but all the other characters seemed very plain and it did get boring at times but Leigh Ann, S. J and Miss Sue's character would always hook my interest. I highly recommend you watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
devoted support,"'The Blind Side' is a story about an abandoned man who becomes a football player with help from a family. This movie is based on the true story of Sean Tuohy. In this story, the abandoned man named Michael, who is also called 'Big Mike,' lacks enough education because of his family situation, but a spirited woman named Leigh Anne gives protection to him and ensures he will succeed in the future. With kind and warm support from Leigh Anne, he finds football interesting, and gets an education. He gets better and better at both football and studying through daily practicing and teaching by the tutor Leigh hired. Not only Leigh, but also her family come to understand his situation and supported him. Especially, S. J. is cooperative with 'Big Mike.' I think this movie shows his true effort to be a good football player with devoted support from the family. To sum up, I suppose this movie is worth watching if you like sports and family love.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Emotional...,"""The Blind Side"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch the remarkable true story of Michael Oher, a young man from a tough background who finds a second chance in life thanks to the kindness of a compassionate family.I enjoyed this movie very much because it was based on an inspiring true story that captured the journey of Michael Oher from homeless to becoming an NFL star. It also had emotional depth and a strong message about the power of love and opportunity. The interpretation of Sandra Bullock who played as Leigh Anne Tuohy was outstanding and she brought warmth and strength to her role, showing the transformative impact of kindness and acceptance. The story was uplifting, but it didn't shy away from the real struggles that Michael Oher faced, something that made it even more powerful. All in all, I have to say that ""The Blind Side"" is an inspiring movie that was both entertaining and emotionally resonant so, I highly recommend it to everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Nice Movie with Memorable Performance,"The best parts of this film are Sandra Bullock's performance -especially when she puts that face with quivering eyes-, Quinton Aaron's (Michael Oher), silent suffering and Jae Head (S.J. Tuohy)-with his funny remarks-. The story is touching and the visuals are more than beautiful.Other aspects of the movie were also important as long as the well elaborated script reflected a good rhythm and kept interest through the progress of the narrative. Michael's life details are revealed in accordance to the scenes' relations bringing out the drama of his childhood and frustrations from his mother's behavior.You could dispute the archetypal approach about the afroamerican's way of living but it serves to the story's purpose, which is based on actual facts wherein a white family supported this child's overcome from poverty and hopelessness -it really impressed me Michael's answer to Leigh Ann's comment when setting up his bedroom-.I watched Meryl Streep's performance which competes against Bullock's at the Oscars and I definitely have to lean toward the latter because of her deliverance showing a human and Cristian approach which enhances a wonderful message regardless the political or classist status./",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

just one thing...,"I just saw this for the first time last night (yes, we are WAY behind) and I really liked it. I think it is one of those movies that makes you examine your own life and makes you feel so incredibly lucky. I have to say that I cried A LOT. I just kept thinking about how many other kids are out there living through similar situations and how many people COULD be helping, but aren't and it all culminated into a very emotional evening for me. My only real complaint was the music. During the first football game scene I felt like the music could have been a little more upbeat and it would have been nice if it had been a song that's well-known or something. It just didn't really get me excited for the game, the way MOST football movies do. Come to think of it, the music through-out the whole movie was like that... Other than that, the movie was really great and I think everyone should see it...then go out and do something nice for someone! lol",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A typical feel-good movie with practically no conflict.,"""The Blind Side"" is a typical ""feel good"" movie with moderately strong religious overtones and very little conflict. There is so little conflict, in fact, that it's hard for the abundance of warm, happy moments to have very much effect. In short, the movie to come off as cheesy and insignificant.""The Blind Side"" opens with the climax of the movie, which is probably the moment with the most conflict; the only one to piqué my interest to any degree. The opening is vague and makes things seem much more serious than they really are. Then the movie flashes back to the beginning of the story it has to tell.Michael Oher is a bastard son, born to a crack-addicted mother, living with the father of his friend. He sleeps on the couch and has never had a bed to himself. Sounds tragic, but don't expect the filmmakers to really show you this. Michael's caretaker is a mechanic and convinces a Christian private school to accept Michael and his son into the school. He talks to the coach and convinces him to push for Michael's acceptance based on a one on one game of basketball that he was playing with the mechanic's son. And for some reason this game convinced the coach that Michael would be good for the football team. I never got that.After this no more is really heard of the mechanic or his son. The son gets accepted but not even Michael is seen socializing with him. They both just disappear. This is so that Michael Oher seems to be the only black student at the school, but it left me with a lot of questions.Michael's crack-head mother lives in a ghetto run by gangs in middle Tennessee. Very little is shown of this ghetto and the gang and of Michael's mother. These were some of the moments where there was a lot of potential for strong and meaningful content but everything was glossed over. There could not have been four or five scenes in the ghetto and all of them were less than 5 minutes in length. The focus if the entire movie was the warm happy-go-lucky family moments where the good-Christian white family accepts a poor, uneducated black kid into their home and as a member of the family. Why should I care about this un-dynamic and trite situation. Even if it is based on a true story, it's all been seen before.The acting ranged from terrible to mediocre to decent. The worst was Sandra Bullock's son and the best was her husband (sorry I'm terrible with names) who felt the most natural. The film focused on Sandra Bullock, but I wasn't convinced by her character as a southern, high-energy republican. The actor who played Michael Oher was flat, but at least it was hard to tell because he had very few lines.The Christian over-tones at the start of the film urged the most resistance from me, but I realized that just because I'm atheist, does not mean the director and writers are too and eventually grew used to it, even though I'll still always find it cheesy.I could have liked this movie, if it was more dynamic, but this lacking element caused the story telling to be weak and left little room for any of the actors to shine. It was ""meh"".",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

Movie is Mainly Good,"This is the sports bio of football player Michael Oher.I honestly wasn't excited with watching to begin with, both worried about what I'd heard and also simply not a football fan myself.However, after seeing the entire thing, I can say I enjoyed the story. The characters (based on real people, but perhaps not fully reflecting them) all had flaws, but they also had strength. Most of all, as a found family, they showed love.---Granted straight up, there were moments of overdone white saviorism (that's the concept, after all, about a rich white family taking in a poor Black kid during high school)
There were moments of cringe condescension.However, there were also real discussions of racism and the fact that it's systemic in ways people don't realize until it knocks on their own front door.That's what saved it for me.---Quinton Aaron does such a great job with the character, Michael, that you go from sympathy to just realizing how many things about him there are to love. I think I first truly realized this when he was with the kids at the playground, but then the bit of the plot where we realize he's just not into the violence of the sport.Sandra Bullock is an ""every mom,"" kicking butt for her kids (adopted or not) and outwardly living her values. I loved her scenes with Tim McGraw as the husband. Poor man knows how lucky he is, but he also knows who's in charge.The movie is beautifully shot and edited, along with the acting.And there's a reason for it's popularity.Personally would re-watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Sandra Bullock Finally Makes It To The Top,"Making schmaltzy movies is a thing Hollywood is overly good at. Music rises telling us when to get that lump in our throat. Actors talk softly with a glistening eye. And the love-fest ensues.If you abhor these types of films, then you might want to avoid THE BLINDSIDE. Not because all of that is in here, but because some of it is ...but only mildly. If you despise the ""great white person saving the {insert minority here} other person from certain doom"" theme, you might want to avoid this flick, too. Yes, some of that is in here, too. So why, oh why, did I rate this film so highly. Well, it's not overly schmaltzy nor overly great-white-hope-ish either. It is a (relatively) true telling of NFL star Michael Oher's early, troubled life in Memphis, Tennessee.Homeless at 16 (and without parental guidance), ""Big Mike"" is seen wandering the streets by the affluent Leigh Tuohy (Sandra Bullock, THE LAKE HOUSE) and her family. They do ""the good Christian thing"" and offer the big guy a place to sleep for the night. But as the strong, silent Michael attempts to leave the next day, Leigh decides to have him stay another night. And so goes his induction into the Tuohy family.But before he gets into the NFL, Michael (Quinton Aaron) must first pass high school and then get into college. He must overcome the whitewashed system of academia in upscale Memphis to do it, too. He soon receives help with the arrival of a tutor, Miss Sue (Kathy Bates, CHARLOTTE'S WEB) who toughens up Michael's mental muscle and prepares him for his college days.Most of this is just backstory, however, for the main event, which is Michael's immediate rise onto the football circuit. His size and speed shock all those who watch his games, making him a prime candidate for college scouts.The film isn't without its funny moments, though, most of which are thanks to S.J. (Jae Head, HANCOCK), the Tuohy's youngest – and very small – son who helps Michael navigate through all of the college offers that come his way. There are also some combo touchy-feely and comical moments. The one that comes to mind is when the Tuohy's ask Michael to become a member of their family and he says, ""I thought I already was."" The main draw here is, finally, Sandra Bullock. Not known as a powerhouse actress and more as one who goes after the money, Bullock may have gotten lucky and found the part she could play so well that it grabbed her an Oscar. Her Leigh portrayal was truly excellent. But was it as good as, say, Gabourey Sidibe's PRECIOUS? Or Meryl Streep's Julia Child in JULIE AND JULIA? Some think not (Does Meryl need another Oscar? I mean, really!) Regardless, I think sports movie fans will gobble up this one just as much as HOOSIERS and ROCKY.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best picture nominee? You have GOT to be kidding!!,"I know I'm late to the party but I simply can't resist writing a review even at this late date. I have to get if off my chest and, maybe, I can push some other latecomer off the tracks and out of the way of this runaway train of a movie (must be my ""protective instincts"" <- in joke for those who've seen the flick).I honestly don't think I've ever been more mystified about why a movie received so much praise; and a 'Best Picture' nomination, to boot! ""Mystified"" isn't even right the word. More like 'astounded', 'flabbergasted', 'dumbfounded', or whatever the right synonym is for the combination of puzzlement and outrage I have after watching it. I mean this movie is BAD! ROTTEN to the core! LOUSY in every way! What absolute and utter dreck! WHO could have possibly thought this travesty of a movie was one of the ten best of the year? Did they think they were nominating for the Razzies?What's that you say? What about Sandra Bullock? Exactly! WHAT about Sandra Bullock!? That she can take on a role requiring the most meagre of ranges and stay with it for two hours of screen time? Heck, if this had been a play and not a movie, then instead of an Oscar she could have gotten a Tony - a one schtick Tony!If Sandra Bullock's performance is the apex of one-dimensional acting (I guess that would give her at least one 'point' in her favor - ha ha!), the script must be the highest (and never before climbed) peak in the range of movies that have used back to back to back and back again clichés. As I watched it, I found myself repeatedly saying, ""Oh no, there not going really use that trope, are they?"" But, oh yes, they sure did! And then another. And another . . . Still, I suppose the screenwriters did show some restraint in this respect. I mean they did, after all, manage to resist using the old trick of showing newspaper headlines to announce Michael's initial successes to the audience. Yup, I didn't see one spinning 50-point font headline screaming, ""Big MIke does it again!!"". Not even an ""Oher leads to team to championship!"". But, please note that I said I ""didn't SEE"" anything like that. Full disclosure - it may have happened while I had my eyes closed in an effort to stem another wave of nausea.And don't even let me get me started on its race, prejudice, and sensitivity 'aspects'. Like I said, this is a movie where each scene is a cliché about to unfold, dissolving into a cliché, and fading out to, guess what. Oh yeah.Looking for the bottom line? Okay.

"Yes, inspirational, but thankfully not cheesy","""Another inspirational sports film,"" was what I read on IMDb before watching the movie. Not exactly what I like so I went into the movie expecting cheese, or worse, boring cheese. Hence I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy the movie, which could've fallen on the wrong side of ""inspirational"" but didn't, largely thanks to the charms of Sandra Bullock.The movie was undoubtedly fluffy despite it being based on a true story, but I thought director John Lee Hancock did well in not creating any overly-schmaltzy scenes in which I would cringe. I really don't mind feel-good movies as long as the director doesn't get heavy-handed with heart strings-tugging techniques.The star of the movie is undoubtedly Bullock, who is radiant and charming. It's not a big dramatic role that requires all sorts of emotions but neither was Erin Brocovich, and that got Julia Roberts her Oscar.

Don't turn a blind eye to this one.,"I am English and as such quite ignorant of the specifics of American Football. Fortunately I am not a lost cause as 'The Blind Side' does not revolve around the sport, despite featuring it heavily. In truth, the movie tells the story of the influence that one unfortunate individual and a wealthy family have on one another. 'The Blind Side' the title refers to is not the technical aspect of the game so much as the aspects of life that each party has been missing, the aspects of life that they discover through each other's presence. In essence the story is a rags-to-riches tale, which may contribute partially to its emotional power; however, this film is not so shallow, focusing on spiritual, rather than material wealth. Even when dabbling in clip montages the picture is never superficial.Sandra Bullock delivers an Oscar-worthy performance in her award-winning role as Leigh Anne Tuohy, who takes broken youth Michael Oher under her wing when he starts attending the same Christian educational institute as her own children. With the love of a family and the support of a determined mother and father figure, the initially troubled and introverted Michael begins to excel in both studying and sports, despite the low expectations of his teachers. 'The Blind Side' encompasses not only Michael's transition as a character, but also the transition of his carers.What is most refreshing about 'The Blind Side' is that the film does not lose itself in its serious tone, delivering the full spectrum of emotions including humour, entertaining the audience by allowing viewers to share not only the moments of grief and strife that these characters suffer, but also the moments of joy that they experience. Why should movies (Oscar contenders or not) sacrifice such affairs in order to maintain critical integrity?Immersing and inspiring, 'The Blind Side' is a rare achievement in storytelling that, notwithstanding heartache and sorrow, conveys a consistent sense of realistic satisfaction that is sadly often lacking.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Blind Side portrays a family trying to overcome societal divisions in the south.,"Based on the novel by Michael Lewis, The Blind Side portrays the classic storyline of trying to find a place in the world. A powerful script written by John Lee Hancock strengthens the impeccable performances of Sandra Bullock and Quinton Aaron. Their authentic expressions and flawless delivery leave viewers enthralled with The Blind Side.Michael Oher is a young man from Hurt Village of Memphis, Tennessee. He has never had a permanent home, having been passed through the foster care system since a young age. He has been accepted to the elite Wingate Christian School mostly due to his size. The coaches want Micheal for their sports teams, but his grades need to improve greatly. Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy are typical wealthy southerners. Their children, Collins and SJ, attend Wingate and after Collins' volleyball game the Tuohys see Michael picking up left behind popcorn to eat. They see him again walking in the icy rain after SJ's play. Leigh Anne decides to invite him into their home for the night. The next day, the Tuohys welcome Michael to stay for their Thanksgiving meal. After that, Michael never wants to leave.Sandra Bullock delivers a strong performance as Leigh Anne Tuohy. Dressed in white she gives off an air of perfection, power, and protection that can not be duplicated. She upholds the definition of a matriarch being career driven but still soft at heart and feels compelled to help Michael. As Leigh Anne looks at Michael and gives him a hug, the audience feels the quickly building love that she has for Michael. This relationship takes two to complete and Quinton Aaron develops his part beautifully. Even though he has few lines, he is able to demonstrate his complex emotions through his expressions. When the Tuohys first see Michael, his past pains and current fears are expressed without him having to say anything.This film earns its acclaim through Bullock's and Aaron's performances, but even more so from its powerful script and storyline. The Blind Side is based largely from Michael Lewis' book, The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game. As writer and director, John Lee Hancock connects his viewers to the picture. He illustrates for them a story of a family opening their home to a boy most would just leave in the streets. Through scenes of love and affection between the Tuohys and Michael, Hancock melts viewers' hearts.The Blind Side is an excellent depiction of a classic cultural struggle. Slightly disguised by a strong storyline and terrific acting, this movie brings up the social and racial divisions that are still present today. The Blind Side shows how one family chose to break those barriers for one boy. Leigh Anne Tuohy took many strides to prove to others that she loved Michael in spite of his difficult past. Hancock asks viewers to look beyond the cultural norm and see the possibility of fewer societal divisions.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The movie the Blind Side is a true story about a poor African American teenager living in foster care named Michael Oher played by Quinton Aaron.,"Big Tony Hamilton played by Omar Dorsey, a friend of Michael's father introduces him to the coach of Wingate Christian School, Burt Collins played by Ray McKinnon. Burt is mesmerized by Michael's athletic ability and finds a way to get him enrolled into the school despite his unsatisfactory academic record. Leigh Ann Tuohy, played by Sandra Bullock meets Michael for the first time when he is walking at night and quivering in the cold. She invites him to stay the night at their house and spend Thanksgiving Day with them. Gradually Michael becomes a member of their family and they become his legal guardian. Michael's huge size and protective instincts makes him a challenging force on the football field. Although he is taught the game of football by SJ played by Jae Head, it was Leigh Anne Tuohy who made the biggest impact on Michael. With the love of family and Miss Sue's help a tutor played by Kathy Bates, he realizes his ability as a student, a football player, and turns the team into winners.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A heartwarming inspirational sports movie,"The Blind Side is a heartwarming inspirational sports movie. The performances were believable and enjoyable.

The Blind Side is how Political Correctness can blind one's judgment...,"Wow, can you imagine the nerve of John lee Hancock! How dare he portrays a family of good Christians, of wealthy people without any problems and expressing a strange and mutual feeling called love! Can you believe there's also a big African-American kid from an impoverished neighborhood, abandoned by a drug-addicted mother... only to be saved by the knights in white shining armor! And don't get me started on the sappy, schmaltzy, happy ending where they're all celebrating his entry In National Football League.
Well, it's all based on a true story! But still, to pile up so many insults to political correctness and combine them into one movie!!! Now, I'll stop the rant. In case you hadn't noticed, I was being sarcastic. Now, let's be serious and consider what ""The Blind Side"" is truly about.There are two ways to look at the sports biopic: a succession of clichés serving the images of good white savior, and giving a subtle unnoticeable flavor to the infamous ""Uncle Tom"" (some even felt Magical White Negro vibes in the performance of Quinton Arron as Michael Oher) OR you can just enjoy it as a touching movie praising values like love and family, and showing that sometimes, it's not about the ethnic background but the level of violence you've been raised within and that inevitably condition your chances of a successful life. In other words, the rich socialite Leigh Anne Tuohydidn't adopt Mike because he was black, but because he was cold, hungry and in clear need for help. His ethnic race had no more relevance than his size.Speaking of his size, many viewers have criticized the prospect of making him play football, but this isn't an aspect where the Tuohy family had a role to play. The football premise is set-up when one of his friend's father introduces him to the football coach of Wingate Christian school Burt Cotton (Ray McKinnon), the coach is impressed by his size but ""Big Mike"" can't enter the team without good semesters' grades. It's during his struggle to find a way with studies that his life path leads to an encounter with Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock). She didn't use him to satisfy some football- related ambitions but let's just be fair and accept that the guy was also born to play football, if not for his size, but for his wonderful protective instinct. Not to mention that he found something to do with his life and that brought joy to thousands of fans.So give the film a break, it's just about the way loving and caring determine one's path. Take two singers with equal talents, Celine Dion and Whitney Houston, look at the two men of their lives and how each singer ended, it has nothing to do with race, Houston might have had more talent than Dion but her life partner was trash and look how it ended up affecting her, Dion could count on the indivisible love of her husband René.That's all. The whole ""Blind Side"" story revolves around the importance of family and love as drivers, even religion is as secondary as race, it is cleverly used as the ""marketing"" asset behind Mike's recruiting but the film doesn't try to make 'market' it.I'm not surprised by the critics though but they should really pass over people's heads. Quinton Aaron was also criticized but he stroke me more as someone with a capability to listen and whose first reaction after a gesture of love was to be surprised by it because he's not used to. But he doesn't refuse a gesture of love, he smiles and nods. Many times, I expect the film to play the cynical card or inject some conflict but I loved how smoothly it went, how everyone in that family respected and loved Mike, even Lily Collins didn't play the awkward or jealous teenager but was rather sweet and open-minded. Well, little SJ (Jea Head) got on my nerves a few times, but I loved how he negotiated with all the football coaches, the kid meant business! And finally, there's Sandra Bullock in her Oscar-winning role.What I liked about her performance is the way she never overplays it, it could almost pass as a one-note performance until you get the idea that this is woman who must maintain a facade of cold formality and yet finds the proper way to communicate her feelings toward a kid with a totally opposite background, but that's her power, she knows exactly what language to speak and put some people in their place, she's really one cool mom.It's a good comedic role and very entertaining, which makes the more dramatic moments powerfully resonant.There comes a point where the film questions the motives of Leigh Anna and allows Mike to have a rebellious moment, but if you know the real history, you won't be surprised that it's a feel-good movie, which is quite rare from movies that are not comedies. It's a good old traditional family picture that can be enjoyed on a second watching and a third, it it somewhat superficial but not in a bad away, the film doesn't just try to be some grandstanding hymn to tolerance but keeps it simple and straight and humorous.The film was also nominated for Best picture, its second nomination, forcing the Academy to revise their criteria, it was in 2009 and I still remember how surprising the line up was, but retrospectively, there's something Best Picturesque about ""The Blind Side"", once you decide to cut the PC vision and look at it for what is is, a nice and tender family movie, touching, heart-warming and funny.So let's not be blinded by the whole PC conspiracy agenda.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A True Story Done Right,"The Blind Side is based on a true story of a homeless man named Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron). Michael grew up without knowing who his father is and his mother is a drug addict. Michael grew up in the projects of Memphis Tennessee and has very little life skills about him. This is where the Tuohy family comes into play. Leigh Ann and Sean Tuohy (Bullock and McGraw) take in Michael and get him into a very good school called Wingate Christian School. The head football coach thinks he will be an asset on the football team due to his size and strength. Where the teachers at Wingate think otherwise and think he is very unteachable. Like everything, this is a huge adjustment for the Tuohy family and the whole Wingate Christian community. There are ups and downs throughout the film, including Leigh Ann's ""crazy"" mom moments during football games and practices. Throughout the film Michael slowly begins to recognize that he is worth something and that he has some serious potential in life. Michael goes on to play college football at the University of Mississippi and eventually gets drafted in the first round of the 2009 NFL draft to the Baltimore Ravens. This film is an incredible testimony of kindness and brings many viewers to tears.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Blind Side,"I never like to write a title, introduction, middle and end, I like to write randomly.The reason why I liked this movie is that I love story-based movies and I loved watching this movie because it was based on a true story.The story was good too. Now let's talk about the movie itself. Michael Oher was a person who devoted himself to his family and preferred to protect his family no matter what.I like Sean because he doesn't care and is not jealous of his wife (but I would be jealous, his wife is beautiful and has a good character, I would never miss it and I would be jealous)Leigh Anne is a very good person.I have always chosen to follow his example. I'm playing the lead role in this movie.Leigh Anne Tuohy made a great sacrifice for humanity.Anyway, should you watch this movie?

Astonishingly good movie,"This movie is inspired by a true story about no one from a slum area and then became a professional football player, after he was adopted by a rich good American family.I think blind side is a good movie. The story line is very inspiring, because the movie told one way how to be a good Christian family when you live at United states (because there were many dialogue that mention about Christianity). And the journey of the poor boy Michael Oher, who at the first did not know the Tuohys and then became a part of The Tuohys and protector for the youngest member of the tuohy, S.J. Tuohy.The screenplay was very good, you can see many parts of their life. From the first time when The Tuohys met Michael until he got to the university. And there are real footage and pictures from the real character too, and they really helped me to knew the real persons behind the story.I wasn't very surprised when Sandra Bullock got an Oscar for her performance as Leigh Anne Tuohy, because she had done a great job by acting as a kind rich mother. Especially her accent, it was very convincing.Don't worry just because that this is a drama movie so you have to cry all along. I think this movie is fun to watch. Even when I watched it with my family, everybody laugh because a few hilarious parts. So, if you like drama and sport movies, I think this is just for you and you must watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just Watch,"Watching Blind Side was heartwarming. A feeling you usually don't get, when you experience this kind of movie, It's a feeling, which gives joy.

So please take yourself out or your family and enjoy The Blind Side.If your not into football, it won't matter, because it's more than football, and you can see that for yourself.--A.

better than I thought,"I have to confess the only reason that made me to go to the theater is I'm a huge fan of sandra, and I became a fan only after I saw The Proposal, which left a good impression on me. So, pathetically, I went into the movie ALONE. but just after the movie started, I didn't feel lonely anymore. It's a movie about football, but not much a bout football, it's actually about the love between two strangers, that sometimes made you feel really heartwarming. Personally, I don't like Sandra with blond hair, but it did help her to portray the character to make it more realistic. The unreserved love happens between a family and a homeless boy. It's really moving when you saw how they treat him. I was not a football fan before, but now I'm starting to have some interested in it. hope you guys enjoy that",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Touchdown for Humanity: The Inspiring Story of Michael Oher,"The Blind Side is a poignant drama that chronicles the life-altering journey of Michael Oher. Sandra Bullock delivers a powerful performance as Leigh Anne Tuohy, the matriarch who becomes Michael's surrogate mother, while Tim McGraw portrays her supportive husband, Sean Tuohy. The film delves into the profound theme of family, examining its complexities through the lens of race, class, and identity.At its core, The Blind Side is a story of redemption and the transformative power of unconditional love. Leigh Anne's unwavering belief in Michael serves as a catalyst for his personal growth, ultimately leading to his success as a professional football player. The film's exploration of the disparities between the affluent Tuohy household and Michael's impoverished background is a poignant commentary on social inequality.The film's visual style significantly contributes to its thematic impact. The stark contrast between the opulent Tuohy mansion and the dilapidated neighborhood where Michael grew up underscores the chasm between the two worlds. The use of handheld camera work during scenes depicting Michael's early life creates a sense of instability and chaos, mirroring the challenges he faces. Conversely, the steady camera shots in the Tuohy home convey a sense of security and stability, symbolizing the sanctuary Michael finds within the family.The Blind Side is a testament to the human spirit and the power of resilience. By exploring the complexities of family, race, and class, the film offers a hopeful and inspiring message. Its powerful performances and skillful use of cinematic techniques make it a memorable and thought-provoking cinematic experience.Similar to The Blind Side, films like Precious also explore themes of poverty, resilience, and the transformative power of family support.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Blah Side,"What an unremarkable generic movie. This is an overly sentimental hallmark story of a young, homeless black boy being saved and set on the right path by some rich white folks. So... yeah, doesn't really seem great in our current social climate.That aside, this is still just a boring movie that feels like it's just trying to hit all the stereotypical touchy feely Oscar-bait notes. It just feels entirely superficial from the jump and never stopped.Now, some people love those kind of movies and that's awesome, they're just very rarely for me. This isn't bad even, it's just so bland, milquetoast, nothing.

Great movie,"The movie 'The Blind Side' is a movie that I looked forward to watching and it definitely didn't disappoint in my eyes. The movie is great because it's based on a true story of how a couple Leigh Ann and Sean Tuohy, played by Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw, took in a homeless kid and gave him some direction. The kid they took in was Michael ""Big Mike"" Oher who was played by Quinton Aaron. I would consider one of the major themes in this movie to be something along the lines of if you put your all into something no matter the obstacle you'll achieve your goals, and that's exactly what Michael Oher did. I think throughout the film you get many different themes whether it's race, family, or simply sports. I think the film did a great job at being inspirational and giving people hope to succeed. To me this film seems a lot like Gladiator, stay with me for a minute, my reasoning behind this is a person has a family loses them goes through some extremely rough times, but in the end they fight their way to the top and succeed. In Gladiator they had the same issues race, family, and sport, but obviously the movie plot is a touch different and I know this is a long stretch so please just use your imagination and think about it. Overall I think anyone who gives this movie the time will really appreciate it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

TRULY the leading lady of the year...,"As a cinefile, we expect two different (and often separate) things whenever we go to the movies to review a film: a) we expect a deep and intelligent story that will stir our minds and drive us into thinking about any number of topics and the artistry employed in interpreting them on screen, and b) we expect to be moved, touched, impressed, rushed, scared and/or any other verb which applies to making the film memorable and making it, more than a pastime, a viewing experience. Most importantly, it's a rare (and I DO mean rare) feat when a movie fulfills both expectations, and it's films like those that make us film critics rush at our laptops and start pounding away excitedly at the guilt-less keyboard. One such film is the one I've recently returned from watching, namely John Lee Hancock's ""The Blind Side."" The premise is simple and, to a point, overused: poor African-American kid with no hopes in this world and no brains to call his own gets the attention of a white, Christian family who help him smart up, discover his talent and subsequently lead him (through a number of emotional scenes) to success in his area of expertise, usually sports (football). ""The Blind Side"" is the very same thing. It's a poor kid (Quinton Aaron), who looks retarded but is actually quite intelligent and who comes from an abusive, coke-inducing family in some ghetto finding a rich, happy, white family, spear-headed by a cocky, righteous and brave mother (Sandra Bullock) who gives him a home, helps him find his true self and discovers his latent talent for football, which is born out of an instinct for protection. As the kid, called Michael Oher, grows to love and care for his family, he begins to feel he's their protector, and from such intense protective maneuvers such as saving his little brother from a car accident or protecting Sandra Bullock from gansta thugs, comes out his great skill playing Defense on his school's football team, earning surefire attention from all major colleges around the country and close-to immediate success. All of this while understanding the true meaning of family, love and leaving a troubled past behind.Yes, the story is quickly growing stale, and that's the reason why it didn't attract me at first. But after Sandra Bullock won her Oscar for Best Leading Actress for this film, my curiosity got the best of me...and, oh, I'm so glad it did. There are two things (two VERY exceptional things) which make this an intelligent, engrossing and memorable film. First, there's Sandra Bullock's performance which I must admit is more-than-Oscar-worthy and which captivated me from the first second she's on screen to the last one when the credits roll. There you see her, crossing a school hallway ten minutes into the film, gorgeous in a designer outfit and talking heavy business on the phone with some associate. Five minutes later, you just KNOW this is a posh, fancy woman with an attitude and with more balls than anatomically-allowable; you really don't wanna mess with such a strong-minded, fierce woman. And after she meets Michael Oher, your preconceptions of Bullock's character melt away into a pleasant uncertainty and tridimentionalism, where we discover a strong woman with a gentle and caring heart, a whimsical and funny woman with a scared heart, all in one. Bullock has managed to take a single character and make an entire film all about her. You end up caring about this character as if it were your own family you were staring at. She's THAT good! The second thing is the dialogue which is as witty, quick-fired and moving as ever. The story is a ""tale as old as time"" but the dialogue sets fire to the characters and to the plot, and out from the ashes of an overused story rises a phoenix of something refreshing, poignant and with a HUMAN heart we can all relate to. And, of course, most of the dialogue is dominated by Bullock, so you can imagine the quick, memorable, incendiary kind of thing you're going into.Yes, it's rare when a film is both intelligent and memorable...but that doesn't make it an instant classic. Sandra Bullock and the dialogue give this film a wide shelf-life, but the story (which is, in a word, unimpressive), the typical cinematography and the (uncharacteristically) muted score by Carter Burwell figure among it's low points. This film is not an instant classic, and I can't even say it's one of the best films of the year (although it DID earn an Oscar nod in that category), but it's among the films you'll enjoy the most and you'll remember for some time, complete with a reflectively-smiling face and a sense of fulfillment. You CAN'T be disappointed.Rating: 3 stars and a half out of 4!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sandra Bullock at her best,"The Blind Side is one of those films that benefits from telling a great, heartwarming and emotional story. It just feels good to watch and is very uplifting.We are treated to a spectacular performance from Sandra Bullock, who had so much conviction and warmth in this film. She really shone and it is this performance that lifts this film from good to very good. If you are in any doubt about watching this film, her performance alone is reason enough to watch. The performance by Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher was much more restrained and quiet, with little dialogue. He did a lot of acting with his face and body language, which worked really well and was delivered perfectly, balancing Bullock's more self assured character. The dichotomy of these two personalities and backgrounds made for interesting and entertaining viewing.The screenplay for the film is also great, balancing some genuinely good humour with powerful emotional punches and heartwarming moments. I'm sure a few tears will be shed during this film, whether from joy or anguish.I really enjoyed The Blind Side. It has lots of great themes, terrific acting and a brilliant story.

The Blind Side is an amazing movie,"The Blind Side is a compelling movie about the coming together of two very different American experiences. John Lee Hancock wrote and directed this eye-opening biography film that was the fourth highest grossing film in 2009. The film revolves around two main characters: a teenage athlete from the projects and a wealthy suburban family who, in the end, change each other's lives.Hancock took a step in the right direction when deciding on the location for the story. Set in Memphis Tennessee, moviegoers feel the experience of the two Americas. One with well manicured lawns, large houses and a beautiful private school. The other showing the rundown stores and the gritty housing projects complete with broken windows and eviction notices. The clothes of the various characters reflect the two different Americas: preppy and stylish on one side and worn out and drab colors on the other.Quinton Aaron plays one of the two main characters, Michael Oher, also known as ""Big Mike"" to most. Aaron has the large physical stature to fit the role of Big Mike as a budding high school football star, but it is his portrayal of the quiet, but thoughtfulness in Big Mike which makes us root for him to succeed. With few words but realistic facial expressions and slow body-movement, Aaron conveys Big Mike's unease in his new surroundings, his sadness of never experiencing a real family life and ultimately his growing comfort.Sandra Bullock steps into the shoes of Leigh Anne Tuoghy. Bullock is best known for her flirtatious characters in movies like Miss. Congeniality and All about Steve, but in this film, she executes the role of Leigh Anne, not as smiling and flirty, but as a calm, confident wife and a mother of two, whose life is changed by Michael. At one point in the film Leigh Anne is in the projects looking for Big Mike, when a man calls her an expletive. Bullock shows the tension, not by screaming, but with eye contact. She also conveys Leigh Anne's thoughtfulness behind a materialistic appearance. She drives a Mercedes, but calmly yet sternly challenges her lunch friends who almost mock her when she says Michael is apart of the family.Rather than merely walking through the story in chronological order, Hancock effectively uses flashbacks to show the difficulty of growing up with a drug-addicted mother. Learning about Big Mike's rough life was an emotional part of the film. Hancock uses a camera angle to make you feel you are in Big Mike's shoes as he watches his mother struggle. Having a wide camera angle when Big Mike was comes to his new private school helped show how different this setting was from the projects. How the camera moved was nice, creating the storyline to flow well and not having a chopping cut break up to story either. The soundtrack by Carter Burwell added to emotions that the audience and the two different cultures experienced. The football scenes are realistic but do not overwhelm the film. Rather, football is one way the two Americas can come together.The Blind Side will stir a wide range of emotions: from holding back tears to jumping joy. It will also cause adults and school aged kids to have a greater appreciation about what someone from the other America can do or is thinking. That is a lesson, which will make this movie relevant for years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Again and again she hits that one single note, and when you've had enough she hits it some more. Pretty soon she's SO boring. Ultimately she just wears you down. Help!

Film Revew,"The Blind Side is a masterful film that includes the likes of Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher, Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne Tuohy, Tim McGraw as Sean Tuohy, Jae Head as S. J. Tuohy, and Lila Collins as Collins Tuohy to round out the family. Based on a true story, Michael was brought up from a troubled past in Memphis, Tennessee led by his mother who was addicted to alcohol and drugs. Michael was homeless throughout his childhood and often didn't have a place to go until Leigh Anne Tuohy came along and saw Michael walking in the street while it was pouring down with rain. Little did Leigh know that her, her family and Michael's life as well would be changed forever. The story follows Michael and his new family Tuohy's journey as Michael moves in and changes his high school to join a much better football team where he would become an all-American all the way up to eventual first round pick in the National Football League (NFL).This film is a well-rounded mix of emotion and triumph as Michael fights through his past and current demons to better himself as well as the people around him. The overall theme of this film is, in my opinion, beating the odds. From coming from literally being homeless to a first round NFL draft pick is seriously something straight out of a fairy tale. It's absolutely unheard of, until this film and Michael Oher's story was released in 2009. This film is similar in theme to one of the all-time great films, Coach Carter. If you haven't seen Coach Carter by now stop everything you are doing, find Coach Carter on whatever platform you can, and sit down for two plus hours and appreciate greatness. It's a lot to compare these films and their work but the themes are very similar in that Michael Oher and the Richmond High School Boys Basketball team beat the odds and achieve things that will live on forever in a shining bright light for others to be inspired to do just the same, beat the odds.The Blind Side uses multiple techniques that we have been reading about in our class textbook as well. For instance, the film displayed multiple moments of flash cuts, jump cuts, montages, and slow motion to really maximize the viewers pleasure and attention. This was a nicely blended balance of cuts and use of cinematography as well. Overall, I recommend just about anyone to watch this film and if films with the theme are beating the odds this is most definitely one that will catch your attention.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A very touching and emotional film,The standout of the film was defiantly Sandra Bullock and she rightly so deserved an Oscar award. I think that she really became her character and its amazing to see a comedic actress playing such an intense role and i think thats why her performance was so highly praised. The film itself is a very wholesome and clean film. There is nothing offencive in this film which is also why i highly rated this film. The characters were substantial: like Michael (Big Mike)who played a young broken man being mended by Sandra Bullocks family (especially her son S.J) I think this film really shows the good there is in the world and especially because Bullocks character was a Christian so it shows Christians in a positive light which is a great bonus. You really connected and cared for the characters which is what i loved about the film and it kept you engaged in what was taking place. Worth the watch and enjoy!,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Papaya of Football Movies,"Oh, me and my decisions!When I heard all the buzz about Sandra Bullock's performance in The Blind Side, I decided that I just had to rent the DVD. Similarly, when I heard all the buzz about papaya, I decided that I just had to try some. Both of those decisions left a bad taste in my mouth.Perhaps I will post a critique of papaya on some food review site (Rotten Kumquats?), but here I must review films.Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy, a plucky gun-wielding mom with a lot of spunk (remember what Lou Grant said about spunk?) One day, Leigh Anne notices a behemoth named Michael Oher (played well by Quinton Aaron) walking around shivering and homeless. She invites him to stay overnight in her upscale home.Now, I don't know about most guys, but if some rich woman that looked like Sandra Bullock invited me to stay overnight in her home, I'd be there faster than a Viagra-laden Superman flying to his date with Lois Lane. However, after a few minutes of listening to Tuohy's junior- high psychology as well as enduring her general all-around annoying personality, I'd be out of there faster than Sarah Palin's ouster from a Mensa meeting.Then there's Bullock's performance itself. I don't know if it suffered from the fact that she was portraying such an irritating person. I was hoping some hulk from the football team would mistake her for a blocking sled and... well, not really. But maybe the fact that the character got under my skin so much says something about Bullock's acting.I doubt however that this is what was intended by all those involved in making this flick. But even discounting the annoying main character, John Lee Hancock's dull and tedious direction makes this movie hard to bear.And, by the way, I'm still waiting for the first great football film to be made (the best of the bunch, Jerry Maguire and Heaven Can Wait, can only marginally be considered football films).However, I wouldn't be surprised if someone has already made a movie about papaya that is more palatable than The Blind Side.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
great movie!,"I honestly don't know why people are dissing this movie. I finally got around to watching it and I was amazed, inspired, touched and hopeful. It's an inspiring story of a wealthy, Christian Memphis family who takes in a neglected teenager named Michael who has fallen through the cracks. He is shown unconditional love, support and faith and learns to be a part of a family and a community. This is a great family movie that I am proud to show my kids. It shows the unfortunate reality of racism, rednecks and assumptions. But it also shows the importance of acceptance (especially of those democrats...har har), family and dedication. People need to chill out and just enjoy this movie. So it doesn't have blood, boobs, car chases, explosions, or CGI. But this is a touching movie that I wish were the rule than the exception.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Based On A True Story,"What can I say about this movie, but that Sandra Bullock is definitely my favourite when it comes to true drama. Bullock was inspired by the true-life story of Football offensive lineman Michael Oher, who was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens by the NFL. Quinton Aaron, who plays Oher, did such a good job portraying him. Sandra Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy and musician Tim McGraw plays her husband Sean. Of course inspired by true events, 'The Blind Side' was based on the 2006 book The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game by Michael Lewis and the storyline follows Oher from his impoverished upbringing, through his years at Briarcrest Christian School in Memphis, Tennessee. It's a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Just not very good.,"I didn't think this was as offensively bad some do, but it certainly wasn't any good. A lot of people cried foul at the ""white woman saves the day!"" aspect, but since it's a true story I didn't mind it too much. What I did mind was the lack of realism in a lot of it. Not only did they change the facts to make it seem like Oher was this doofus nobody who was taught everything about football by Leigh Anne Tuohy, but scenes like the one where she went into the projects on her own just felt so cheap and artificial. I don't know, a lot of the scenes with Tuohy felt like the writer was just sitting behind his computer writing it thinking, ""Damn that bitch is sassy!"".Sandra Bullock doesn't really help matters, but I was surprised by her restraint in a lot of scenes. When I first heard that awful accent in the opening monologue I shuttered at the idea of spending two hours with it, but was surprised to find her not very grating. Actually, she ended up feeling more flat than anything else, as did a lot of this film. It wasn't a brutal watch by any means, but everything was really brought down to it's lowest denominator and turned into this dry, vanilla TV movie. It also features what has to be some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard. A project gangster actually says the line, ""I'll bust a cap in your fat ass."" What.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Humility goes a long way,"What worked:
The movie is heartwarming and beautiful family movie that you can enjoy with your family . It's an inspirational movie; a movie about a life changing elements in a boy's life. The best thing about the movie is the screenplay. It's well written and executed piece of work. Sandra and the boy both were good in their respective roles. The fact that it's based on a true event makes us introspect and appropriate life, love and opportunities. Overall, a movie more about relationships than football
What did not work:
I would have appreciated more if the psychological transformation of the boy was more vivid and distinct even though a gradual one. Of course the movie illustrates that but I would have loved to see the boy's perceptions and his inner conversations
Final verdict: recommended",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Absoulteyly wonderful and uplifting,"The Blind Side is a terrific heart-warming story of a young man who is adopted by a rich white couple. He shows an aptitude for football and wins everyone over with his simple love of the game. The Mother is especially fierce and tenacious, however she's also warm & loving.
The only issue I have is with the casting director who hired a 25 year old man to play a 16-hour old boy. Anyone who believed this full-grown man was 16 yrs old, needs their head examined.
All-in-all it is a terrific story.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Heartwarming Tale of Perseverance and Transformation,"The Blind Side is an incredibly inspiring film that highlights the power of kindness, determination, and the transformative role of education. Based on the true story of Michael Oher, the movie follows his journey from homelessness to becoming a professional football player, with the unwavering support of the Tuohy family.What stands out most is the way the film balances raw emotion with moments of triumph. Sandra Bullock delivers a phenomenal performance as Leigh Anne Tuohy, a strong-willed woman who believes in Michael's potential when no one else does. Her compassion and determination to make a difference reflect the values we all need in a society often driven by self-interest.Michael's story is one of resilience-a reminder that no matter how challenging our circumstances are, perseverance and the right opportunities can change everything. This theme resonates deeply, especially for those who admire motivational stories of overcoming adversity.Beyond its emotional core, the film subtly critiques social inequality and challenges us to consider our responsibility toward others. It's a must-watch for anyone who values stories of hope, empowerment, and the belief that every person deserves a chance to succeed.A perfect blend of heart and inspiration-The Blind Side is a movie that stays with you long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

He begins to receive a lot of attention from his coach and players around him.He signs with Ole Miss, and plays where his adopted family are alumni from and he ends up being a top recruit in the NFL draft. What an inspirational movie. The movie is played by, Tim Mcgraw Sandra Bullock Quinton Aaron. A moving and inspirational film that shows happiness and sadness but also the greatness of mankind. This young man would have been lost without help and hope.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bland,"The Blind Side accurately recounts the incredible journey of Michael Oher, who became NFL champion with the Baltimore Ravens since the release of the movie.Unfortunately, John Lee Hancock delivers his story in a monotony inversely proportional to Michael's exceptional ascent. The movie turns out to be too bland, too tidy, the script is predictable, pretty shallow, and relies so much on melodramatism that, after more than two hours, it becomes annoying.What The Blind Side lacks is emotions, and in this sense, other directors, such as Clint Eastwood or maybe Peter Berg, probably would have elevated the level of this feature for which god knows how Sandra Bullock received the Oscar for best actress.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
THE BLIND SIDE Shines Brightly,"In the tradition of feel good sports movies like The Rookie and Hoosiers comes The Blind Side, and what sets this apart from the genre is a commanding performance by Sandra Bullock. In her best role to date, Bullock's character lifts this story, one that is a perfect example of popular film-making and its themes of love, hope, and redemption.Opening with the infamous injury of NFL quarterback Joe Theisman by Lawrence Taylor, the film centers on the importance of protecting the quarterback's 'blind side', and hence the position of left tackle has become vital to a football team's success. This true story recounts the beginnings of tackle Michael Oher who was eventually drafted by the Baltimore Ravens.Coming from a broken family, Oher enters a predominantly white high school. Quiet and introverted, he does poorly in his classes and performs marginally in athletic sports. Befriended by a younger boy, S. J. Tuohy, Michael (Quinton Aaron), by circumstance, endears himself to the wealthy Tuohy family, led by strong-willed mom, Leigh Anne (Bullock). She offers the homeless boy a place to sleep for the night which turns out to be a mansion of a home, and in time, a trust and bond develops as he is adopted by this surrogate family. Leigh Anne makes the young man her project so to speak and grows to love him as her own despite his abusive childhood which includes his biological mother who can barely survive on her own and his friends from the 'hood who border on criminals.Encouraged by his 'family' and the school faculty, Michael improves his grades and play on the football field. He opens up and is befriended by more schoolmates. Because his sense of family is so important to him, he takes his protective instincts to a new level, and it carries over to football with spectacular results. Before long, marquee college coaches descend on Memphis and attempt to recruit the gentle giant. To help get his grades get up to par, the family hires a tutor, Miss Sue (Kathy Bates in an all too brief role). When an official from the NCAA interviews Michael about any conflict of interest (since the Tuohys are avid Ole Miss Alumni) with the University of Mississippi, Michael is at a crossroads in his career and relationship with the Tuohy family.There are moments to savor such as Thanksgiving in the Tuohy household and how the family rallies around Michael. And of course, the famous scene where Leigh Anne coaches Michael to protect his quarterback as if he were family is amusing. When she delves into his neighborhood, she gets a heavy dose of living on the other side of the tracks, and a scene where a local gang confronts her and gets more than they expected is a standout. It is a stark contrast to her comfortable lifestyle and her judgmental friends. The college recruitment scenes are amusing and lend an air of authenticity by showing real life coaching legends like Nick Saban and Lou Holtz. What is refreshing is how Michael is befriended by S. J. and later, his sister, Collins. Having children making positive, life affirming choices for the welfare of others is a rare depiction in film.Director John Lee Hancock (The Rookie) deserves credit for weaving a good script based on Michael Lewis' book into a pretty good film with a strong cast. The Tuohy kids are well played by Jae Head and Lily Collins, and singer Tim McGraw is quite good as Leigh Anne's supportive husband Sean. But this is most definitely Bullock's show, and her energy is infectious and carries the film through sheer will. It's the kind of performance that gets awards. Think of Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich.This film is a real crowd pleaser and easily watchable for most family members, not an easy trick. (Do stay for the end credits to see snapshots of the real life Tuohy family.) Yes, the narrative is very straightforward and plays with facts in places, but the spirit of a family and its matriarch who would not let one of her own fail cannot help but touch and inspire.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A wonderful heart warming story.,"What a fantastic and heart warming story The Blind Side is! It's based on the true story of Michael Oher. Michael had no advantages as he grew up with his drug addicted mother. When the story begins he's homeless and is taken in by the very kind and giving Tuohy's. Michael has few skills and appeared to have a bleak future before meeting the Tuohys. The Tuohys support Michael in every way as Leigh Anne, played by Sandra Bullock, spends caring time with Michael and helps him grow and expresses his interests. They even hire a tutor for Michael.I've always loved watching Sandra Bullock act and she didn't disappoint as she earned the Best Actress Oscar in this very convincing performance. She plays the incredibly charitable, nice and yet strong willed Leigh Anne. And in the movie Leigh Anne is definitely a handful. This was a standout performance you'll love to see.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Inspiring, touching and great for family viewing.","This is an excellent film to watch with the whole family, as it conveys a very pertinent and edifying message of integration and overcoming. Based on real facts, it tells the story of Michael Oher, a young black teenager, of enormous stature, who has a big heart and a great dose of kindness and patience. However, he lacks a family: he came from humble beginnings, from a broken family and from a problematic neighborhood, and life did not allow him to study and, therefore, he has no education. Thanks to his potential for rugby, he is admitted to a school for the rich and receives a scholarship. There he will meet a very wealthy family, with whom he will have a friendship, remarkable for him and for everyone in that house.The film is so tender and full of goodness that it sometimes sounds almost like a fairy tale. It is not easy, nowadays, to find people as well-intentioned as that family, nor to see young people who have Oher's life path and have never felt revolt or suffered with the temptation of a life of marginality. It is truly touching, and the story told wins our hearts quickly. Technically, it is a discreet film, which leaves all the space for the story told and for the good interpretation of the cast. However, we can admire the excellent cinematography, a very well done edition and good visual and sound effects.The cast, in fact, is an essential part of the charm of this film. First of all, for the superb performance of Sandra Bullock in the role of Leigh Anne, the matriarch of the family. With a willful, strong and energetic spirit, she is a woman of fiber and courage who defends her family and what she has faith with all her energy, and Bullock is perfect for playing women with such a dose of personality. She won, with this film, the Oscar for Best Actress, and deserved it with all the merits. Quinton Aaron was also quite good in the role of the gigantic Michael Oher, however Bullock robs him of all the role whenever she appears on the scene. Jae Head is a good addition and brings an additional dose of tenderness to the film. Tim McGraw and Lily Collins do what is necessary, but they do not stand out much more than what is required.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A fine story about a fine family doing a fine thing,"Having read and, by word of mouth, extracted so many positive reviews for ""The Blind Side"" it was nearly impossible not to head into watching it without any preconceived idea of how great - or, for that matter, how poor - it might turn out to be.I see its central theme summarized in one sentence delivered by the woman portraying Michael's crack-addled mother who, upon learning Leigh Anne Tuohy (portrayed quite beautifully by Sandra Bullock) has taken in her son to her home: ""Well, what a fine Christian woman you are."" That is it, really, summed up: The Tuohys did the fine, if extremely improbable, Christian thing by taking a very large black teenage boy into their home. Not just from the wrong side of the tracks, Michael Oher is from the wrong side of life: His mother, not so much a terrible person as a conglomeration of terrible decisions (and, yes, it's often hard to separate the two, but I think it's a useful distinction to make in this case), is so deeply disabled by her addictions that she couldn't care to attend to more needs than her own basic physiological ones, have largely left her many children to whim and circumstance.Michael is a product of this immense, criminal neglect, of an educational system that has discarded him and an environment that merely chews up those who are unfortunate enough to be born into it.But something happened on the way to a dead-end life: Someone - a few people, actually - stood up for Michael, without knowing who he was, really, but rather they saw a faint glimmer of something special in him. Sure, they saw athletic skill - and that has pragmatic value to people these days, especially at the professional level - but they also saw someone of character, a kid who hadn't just given up and succumbed to the lifestyle being offered to him.And the movie addresses, head-on, the controversy bound to be associated with the notion of a well-to-do white family stepping in and ""saving"" a black kid who seemed destined by circumstance to be neglected and forgotten. Not being black I can't say if the idea that white people - especially white Republicans from the South - ""saving"" black kids is a particularly repellent one, but I suspect from the generally militant ideology that tends to surround modern ""blackness"" being true to your being black - even if that ultimately means sliding by this mortal coil with few, if any, prospects - does indeed make it quite repellent.Of course, if a well-to-do black family had taken Oher in there would be no issue and that, really, is the problem: The inherent - and not entirely ungrounded - general distrust of white folk by black folk. The NCAA in the movie merely sits in to speak for millions of blacks who are casting a jaundiced eye to the notions being presented by ""The Blind Side."" For the rest of us - blissfully ignorant white folk, I suppose - ""The Blind Side"" is a great story about a great family who merely decided to the right, Christian thing and step into and ultimately embrace what might be considered by most a very uncomfortable situation. Against considerable odds, Oher has succeeded where few have, even those born to considerably better circumstances. He has triumphed and, by extraction, so has the family who adopted him and made him a permanent part of their lives.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Classic feel good movie,"It's hard to walk away from this movie not feeling uplifted. It's a shame that the movie does delve away from the true story a little to get there. Many sites speak of the real Micheal Oher being quite disappointed with the portrayal of his character. But nonetheless, great story, great acting. Sandra Bullock does a really good job in one of her better acting performances. This movie gets the tear going from time to time. Gotta love a good sports movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A countless act of kindness can turn a life upside down and The Blind Side showed just that.,"A countless act of kindness can turn a life upside down and The Blind Side showed just that. This film was the true story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) who was a homeless teen who knew nothing about the joys of family or having a proper education. Growing up in the projects of Memphis he only knew the effects drugs and what the streets could offer him. Leigh Ann Tuody (Sandra Bullock) was a classy woman living the high life with not a care in the world. It wasn't until their paths crossed that they unknowingly impacted each other's lives forever.Leigh Ann took Michael in for what she thought would be for just one night. She soon realized he had no family and nowhere to go. Michael continued to stay at the Tuody's home and was eventually adopted. When Leigh Ann asked Michael if he wanted to be a part of the family and be adopted his response was, ""I thought I already was."" The Tuody's contributed to Michael's success by giving him a stable environment. He was able to bring up his grades and joined the football team becoming their star athlete.The film used a mixture of angles and music to portray emotion. Michael was a rather big boy and often times he seemed like a giant compared to the other children. But when Michael was feeling sad or intimidated the camera would draw back making him look rather small conveying that Michael was uncomfortable and not feeling like the big man on campus. The music played a big part in the film as well letting you know when something important was happening in Michael's life.This film was filled with joy, laughter, tears and compassion. When a family takes in a complete stranger and turns their life around for the good it's not only a selfless act of kindness but shows that there are still good people out there. This reminds me of the film Seven Pounds where Ben Thomas (Will Smith) seeks out to change the lives of seven strangers. Ben is the one ultimately transformed in the end by one of his strangers Leigh Ann was changed by Michael. Random acts of kindness are not seen every day so when someone goes out of their way to help someone out the way the Truody's did Michael it's heartwarming.Michael not only graduated from high school but went on to a Division I college Ole Miss. He was later drafted into the NFL.This was a great and inspiring movie. I would recommend this movie for all ages. It teaches us life lessons that not everyone is the same yet there are still people out there willing to lend a helping hand to help you reach your destiny.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Blind Side,"The Blind Side, directed & written by John Lee Hancock, who also directed The Rookie, was ""based"" on Michael Oher's true story, and Michael Lewis' 2006 book, The Blind Side. I went to the theaters, in 2009, to watch this film, and I left feeling so happy that I supported it. After doing further research of the film, not only did they cut out a few useful scenes, they absolutely botched who Michael Oher really is, and his story. This was just a white, feel good film.Hancock made Oher soft & shy, to help build the emotion this film possesses, but in reality, he was an outspoken, delinquent. Quinton Aaron did a good job for what he was handed, but I just couldn't buy into this manufactured story. Jae Head put on a charming performance, playing Big Mike's little brother. His connection with Big Mike was probably one of the best of the film, selling each scene perfectly together. Hancock didn't really focus too much on Collins, or Mr. Touey's character, nearly as much as Mrs. Touey & SJ. The main attraction to this film, was Sandra Bullock. Bullock won an Academy Award for Best Actress, due to her inspiring performance, and being easily the best asset to this film.Overall, due to the hack job John Lee Hancock did with Michael Oher, and the story as a whole, I really can't recommend this film.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
