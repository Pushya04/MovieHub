Excellent summer movie,"This movie will never win an Oscar, but it still surprised me and became my favorite summer movie this year. The plot, as in all good summer comedies, is simple. Two guys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors, who deliver their performances perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who may be ready to move on with his life. Vince Vaughn is his best friend who frequently acts like a spoiled, horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in, well almost anything he has ever made, then you have seen these characters before. But still, they just work well together here. The movie contains just enough real emotion to keep you caring and enough absurdity and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't Shakespeare, but it is funny. Highly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This movie was hilarious,"An excellent comedy, Vince Vaughn is a gifted comedian. He kept ""Old School"" going, was the only light in a dismal ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", and had a terrific debut lead in ""Swingers"". I highly recommend people considering this movie, to watch the extras on the DVD; there is a karaoke scene at an Asian wedding which will have you rolling. It is a shame it was cut from the movie, but as the director's comments stated, ""They just couldn't find a place where it would fit."" I was very pleasantly surprised at the number of times I laughed out loud, a rarity for me while watching comedies. The lines were witty, the delivery was crisp, and the jokes were mostly new and fresh. Rachel McAdams was stunning, an excellent casting choice to play the object of Owen Wilson's desire. Despite the more or less rehashed plot (two guys lie about themselves to meet women, only to find that they now have a dilemma when they find 2 they really like), the film is nonetheless novel and original. There are a number of obviously stereotypical characters, (drunken grandmother, artistic introverted son, psychotic cheating boyfriend, immoral mother, powerful father), but they work in this film. Particularly the grandmother, who is prone to drunken scatological exclamations, had me laughing my head off. It was quite unexpected.Although many of the situations could come off as contrived, they were secondary to the excellent repartee between Wilson and Vaughn. Their comic pairing worked to a T.R.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wilson and Vaughn: The Perfect Couple?,"The Frat-Pack, are surely the hardest working collective in Hollywood. Hardly a month goes by without a movie featuring Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jack Black, Will Ferrell, or those Wilson boys Luke and Owen being released.When Starsky and Hutch paired Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller it was good, when Dodgeball put Vince Vaughn with Ben Stiller it was better, but ""Wedding Crashers"" could well be the finest Frat-Pack pairing to date.Although Wilson and Vaughn have appeared in four movies together so far, this is the first where they've both taken star billing. In ""Wedding Crashers"", John Beckwith (Wilson) and Jeremy Klein (Vaughn), are a pair of divorce mediators whose passion in life is sneaking into weddings to take advantage of the free food.. and of course score with girls.They have a strict 'crashers rulebook', which dictates the etiquette of the pick-up, such as 'never use your real name'. It also suggests, by behaving raucously, loudly and generally being the life-and-soul, people will think you're so obnoxious, you can't not have been invited.The pair eventually find themselves at odds with each other when John meets and falls for a bridesmaid at the Washington society wedding of the year.Although ""Wedding Crashers"" is at times formulaic, the comic performances raise this movie above par and in lesser hands the main characters could have descended into Rom-Com cliché. The fast-talking machine-gun delivery of Vaughn is the perfect accompaniment to Wilson's laconic style. Their single-guy banter's often painfully accurate, as is the acknowledgement they're both a little too old to be acting so carelessly. There are also some great comic set-pieces too, notably the divorce meeting, the weddings montage, the cringe-worthy football game and the hunting trip.The supporting cast are also an asset, Christopher Walken expertly walks the tightrope of being both broodingly intimidating and likable, while Rachel McAdams' 'Claire' has a charming vulnerability and an easy-to-fall-in love with quality. Former ""Home and Away"" pin-up Isla Fisher however, is less convincing.I admit ""Wedding Crashers"" is far from perfect, at time situations seem too contrived, the nudity is laughably gratuitous, and Claire's evil fiancée Sack (Bradley Cooper) is an almost too heavy-handed device to make Wilson look good.But if you can look past all that, and simply accept it for what it is, you're left with a very funny film. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Come on...,"OK ,i did find the premise interesting , but come on, the acting is frequently over the top, the characters reactions extreme and unbelievable and so is the ease by which the central heroes ""score"" with women looking better than top models, as well as their total ""immunity"" to the occasionally ""out of this world"" beauty and heavenly figure of some of their ""victims"" until the ""right"" one comes along...Needless to say that despite it's somewhat original premise ,the film is ridden with clichés and of course a cheesy ""happy"" end...The movie tries hard to not be too sleazy, but sleazy enough for teenagers but the result is not so attractive... On the other hand, there are some clever lines and funny scenes and likable protagonists. Overall though unconvincing and unsatisfactory and therefore, overrated...",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn perfect together,"John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) are business partners and best friends. They have a unique scheme to crash weddings and bed unsuspecting young hot women. When they crash the wedding of the season, John falls completely for bridesmaid Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams) breaking all the rules. Jeremy must submit to her sex-crazed sister Gloria Cleary (Isla Fisher) as his loyal wingman.The concept is great. Some of the jokes work but some really don't. This movie rises with the guys' chemistry. Vaugh's got the manic rantings, and Wilson's got the boy next door charm. Together they form the perfect bromance. And that is the big takeaway from this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Good comedy that only struggles when it has to focus on the actual narrative,"John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey are committed bachelors who enjoy their womanising ways. They specialise in crashing weddings and picking up women for one night stands by taking advantage of their lower defences. Countless scores of women later, John is getting tired but the offer of ""one last big job"" tempts him back to crash the wedding of Treasury Secretary Cleary's daughter. Things go well until John falls for Claire Cleary while Jeremy finds himself trapped with the frighteningly clingy Gloria as the pair accept an invitation back to the weekend retreat of the Cleary family.This did not appear strong enough to draw me into the cinema on its release but, on an trans-Atlantic flight it looked like being good enough to fill some time  which is actually a pretty fair summary of the film's strengths and weaknesses. I say this because it is funny enough to cover the problems that it has and thus will serve up as an enjoyable experience if you're relaxed enough to let this happen. The strengths lie in the lead two characters  they banter, they are lively and they are funny. Funny enough to cover up the fact that they are exploitative and sexual predators and funny enough to mean that the scenes where they are doing their thing are generally enjoyable. Of course it helps that Wilson and Vaughn are both doing their thing as usually and have great chemistry together  good news if you usually like them but, if you don't, then why bother? The weaknesses come in with the actual story because, every time someone has to fall in love with someone else, the laughs stop, the pace slows and the whole thing takes on a mushy air that doesn't gel that well with the banter scenes. Likewise the plot devices in the second hour tend to feel a little forced where they are just used to provide direction and create a proper ending etc. This doesn't mean it is terrible but it cannot be a good thing when you actively wish the plot would take a backseat in a film. The support cast share the comedy reasonably well; McAdams is cool and appealing, Fisher is a bit OTT but is funny, Seymour plays on her sexy image really well while Walken is reliable as ever as Christopher Walken.Overall this is an enjoyable if patchy comedy. It trades on the usual delivery and chemistry between Wilson and Vaughn and the two do well to produce the film's best scenes when they are together. The need for a plot, romance and separation does hurt the film a little (because it is not as good as the aimless banter) but not a massive amount. Not a great comedy then but certainly good enough to please anyone who liked Anchorman, Dodgeball and other films of similar styles of humour.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Shut-Down Your Brain and Laugh,"The thirty and something years old bachelor partners and best friends divorce mediators John Beckwith (Owe Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) have a hobby of crashing weddings following predetermined rules to have one night stand with different women. When they decide to crash the most important wedding of Washington pretending they are brothers, in a party promoted by the Secretary of Treasury William Cleary (Christopher Walken), John breaks their rules and has a crush on Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams) and Jeremy scores the sex-addicted Gloria Cleary (Isla Fisher), both daughters of William. Gloria invites Jeremy to spend the weekend at the Cleary family estate, and John sees the chance to be close to Claire, in spite of her engagement with the arrogant Zachary ""Sack"" Lodge (Bradley Cooper). Along the weekend with the dysfunctional Cleary family, John and Jeremy will fall in love for the sisters, but their real identities jeopardize the relationship.""Wedding Crashers"" is silly and will never win or will be nominated to an Oscar. But it is also hilarious, with many funny situations. The great cast shows a fantastic chemistry and seems to have fun while making the movie, and is supported by a delicious screenplay and an excellent music score. My advice is simple: shut-down your brain and laugh with this highly recommended comedy. See also their one hundred and fifty-five (155) Rules of Wedding Crashing in IMDb.

One of the best comedies of 2000's,There are always comedies that top the comedy list during a decade. Wedding Crashers is without question on that list for the 2000's. Vince Vaughn & Owen Wilson are tremendous together!,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"This movie isn't smart. It isn't great. But it's ""fun.""","The opening sequence with Dwight Yokum and Rebecca De Mornay is one of the funniest in the film. The rest doesn't live quite up to it. The movie suffers from an improbability problem. I know from working weddings like some they went to, it's not easy to sneak into a wedding, especially high profile weddings with bouncers and giant men standing at the doors looking at your invite! Besides that, I will say I enjoyed the film. It's not as funny as say, 40 Year Old Virgin, but there's some good stuff in there. Keir O'Donnell has some of the funniest moments in the film as the goth/artist/gay son of Walken. These were some of the laugh out loud moments of the film.Owen Wilson is very likable in the film as the partier-coming-to-grips with his age and wanting more out of life. He more or less plays the straight man to Vince Vaughn's antics.Vaughn speaks in lightening fast dialogue most of the movie. Funny, and good, but at times I was left scratching my head. He's a strong actor and makes strong choices in this movie.The directing by Dobkin sometimes feels less than good. Desk scenes shot with 2 cameras make it look like the actors are improvising most of their lines and leaves these ""buddies"" looking a bit too disconnected.Bottom Line: If you enjoy comedies, especially of this genre, see it. It is very formulatic and if you're smart, you'll know how it ends about 30 minutes into this overly long comedy. (over 2 hours) PS: Will Ferrell turns in a very odd performance as Chazz Reinhold the ultimate wedding crasher. You might feel a little dirty after watching this near out of place character.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Witty, raunchy and sure to become a 'classic'","Saw a advance screening of this on Friday night. Hilarious doesn't do the film justice. You know how in most films you remember the funniest parts and bring them up as you leave the theater? This one, it's hard to remember the best parts because there's so many of them.Unlike his previous films, where Vince Vaughn is usually reduced to the role of 'scene stealer', here we get a full dose of Babaganush, and he's in his finest form since 'Swingers'. If you liked him in his Swingers/Made persona, you'll love him here. Some of the riffs that he has literally will have you holding your sides with laughter.Owen Wilson is Owen Wilson. You either like him or you don't. He's more of the straight man in this film, although he does have some pretty good lines too, and he has great chemistry with Vaughn, especially in the scenes where they're fighting. He's the ying to Vaughn's yang.The movie certainly 'earns' it's R rating. There's a healthy dose of nudity, sex related hijinks, and f-bombs. But it's not 'gross out' humor a la American Pie. It pushes boundaries, but not just in a 'shock value' way. It's genuinely funny.I saw the movie with a bunch of critics, who usually the jaded type, were laughing their asses of as well. Guys will love this movie and will be quoting it for the rest of the year. Girls will love it too though, and there is a romantic subplot (cheesy at times, but forgivable given how funny the movie is), with Rachael McAdams doing a great job as Owen Wilson's love interest. Isla Fischer plays the role of 'scene stealer' in this one, serving as Vince Vaughn's psycho love interest. And Chris Walken is Chris Walken.So overall..inappropriate, hilarious and glorious. Better than Oldschool. Way better than Anchorman. Best comedy of the year, maybe the last couple of years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Owen Wilson & Vince Vaughn Really Click Well In This One.,"Wedding Crashers is the latest installment in the new, over-the-top comedies cut from the same cloth as Old School or Meet The Parents. It will take it's rightful place in history along side these great comedies as it deserves.Business partners John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) are also best friends that go way back. Every year they get together and go on a binge of crashing weddings to take advantage of the romance in the air and ultimately, to score with the jealous bridesmaids, or any other single woman for that matter. John and Jeremy are very smooth and do a lot of research to get a back-story that explains who they are, how they are connected to the families and why they are there. They also have what seems to be at least a hundred rules to ensure the crashing of the wedding goes as planned and of course, this could not be possible without the original wedding crasher, Chaz (Will Ferrell), who is not only THE wedding crasher, but also an innovator, as you will see.This all works very well for them until they decide to crash the wedding of weddings, Secretary Cleary's (Christopher Walken) daughter and her new husband-to-be. John was unable to achieve his goal at the Cleary wedding of establishing a relationship with his other daughter, Claire (Rachel McAdams), who he is also falling in love with. Jeremy, too, is having his problems after achieving his goal with the Secretary's other daughter, Gloria (Isla Fisher), perhaps a bit too quickly, as he finds out it was her first time and she quickly attaches herself.The long story made short, both John and Jeremy end up on an extended weekend with the Cleary family and hilarity ensues, very much the same way Ben Stiller was put in uncomfortable positions by his fiancé's family in Meet The Parents.This was a great comedy in which I have heard compared to There's Something About Mary. I would not place it on such an iconic platform but it was very good and holds it's own along with other great comedies of today. Vaughn and Owen are a great team. Will Ferrell is typical Will Ferrell in his small bit part as Chaz. Christopher Walken's part was too small to really be noticed. Isla Fisher played the psycho first-timer in such a way that it even scared me.The biggest surprise of this movie for me was Rachel McAdams. I took notice of her in Mean Girls and I believed she would be typecast in such roles for probably her whole career but she proved she could carry a movie as the lead love interest and was very captivating with her gorgeous smile.If you liked the movies mentioned in this review, then I highly recommend seeing this one as well. It will not disappoint. 8.5/10",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A very clichéd love story, but pretty funny.","Let me start off by saying that I really liked this movie. I thought it was well directed and had a great cast. The only problem really was the second half. The first half was hysterical and funny. The second half was not funny at all. Take Will Ferrel for example. They did nothing with him what so ever. They just expected him to be crashing funerals funny. Because it's Will Ferrel and because he crashes funerals they expected it to be funny, but it's not. Ever since the clichéd love story started is when it went down hill. I mean, we've seen it all before. It's the same love story as ""Meet The Parents, Meet The Fockers, The NoteBook, 13 Going 30, Monster In Law, Titanic, The Wedding Singer, The Wedding Planner, When Harry Met Sally"" and much more. But apart from a terrible second half (and yes, Will Ferrel is part of the second half), the first half was great and hilarious. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Christopher Walken, Rachel Mcadams and introducing Isla Fisher. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A fun comedy that works because of its cast,"Wedding Crashers is a fun comedy that works simply because the filmmakers know what to do with what they've got. The great humor of Wedding Crashers is not found in the cleverness of its script or the creativity of its story, but rather in its lead actors. Had anyone but Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn been the leads, this movie would have tanked. They are both famous for that congenial charisma that so many people find humorous  the type that makes them come off as the fun buddies that we all wish we could call up on a Friday night. Director David Dobkin must know this, because he gives Wilson and Vaughn plenty of scenes to show off the qualities that have made them two of America's funniest and most likable stars.To fulfill the perfect cast, Rachel McAdams and Christopher Walken fill in the necessary roles. McAdams again reminds us why she has become so popular in the past year, glowing with her vibrant smile and charm that interact perfectly with every character on screen, especially Wilson's. Christopher Walken, among his many extraordinary traits, is famous for his dry, sarcastic sense of humor  revealed through his one of a kind voice. He gets a chance not only to earn some laughs in a way that only he can do, but also to play the role of the amiable father figure with the great advice.Make no mistake, though  underneath this film's main selling point of a couple of funny guys going around and crashing weddings to sleep with girls (an idea that is just about concluded within the first 15 minutes)  is a sappy, conventional chick flick. I use that term carefully though, because Wedding Crashers never actually falls victim to the typical stereotypes of your average chick flick. It avoids them because of its great cast and the chemistry they all share on screen  which can appeal to just about anyone who enjoys a good laugh. It conceals the fact that the script is probably one of the worst excuses for a comedy within the past year. What's great is that we never have to look that far  because the characters all seem to be enjoying themselves too much, and they make the film just as enjoyable to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Good performances by Owen Wilson , Rachel McAdams and Jane Seymour.

"Wedding Crashers is a comedy worth watching and is memorable for many reasons, the characters and actors are a big part of it","The film follows John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn), a pair of committed womanizers who sneak into weddings to take advantage of the romantic tinge in the air, they find themselves at odds with one another when John meets and falls for Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams). Wedding Crashers is directed by David Dobkin and written by Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. The cast has lots of famous actors, including Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Christopher Walken, Rachel McAdams, Isla Fisher, Bradley Cooper and Jane Seymour. But honestly the film wouldn't be as good if it weren't for Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, they do a phenomenal job in this film thanks to their amazing chemistry and just acting chops and comedic timing. The supporting cast does too a great job, everyone are a joy to watch. You notice what a good time the actors had filming this and that's how a comedy works the best. The jokes and dialogue are great and the improvisation done by the actors were phenomenal.Wedding Crashers is actually well written and the plot is quite original, mostly because of the screenplay being top notch. But unexpectedly, the editing is great and the cinematography is perfect. David Dobkin's direction and visual storytelling is terrific, he created a romantic comedy that will be remembered for years. It's made by adults for adults, you should know it's credited with helping to revive the popularity of adult-oriented, R-rated comedies. Films like these are scarce as it's genuinely a great and well thought out comedy, made with the upmost care by the people behind the camera and on the camera, and of course everyone else who worked on Wedding Crashers. Andrew Panay, co-producer of the film, had the idea for the film based on his own experience as a wedding crasher in his youth. The first half of the film is superb, it sadly stumbles a bit towards the ending, but overall an incredible comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The editing could've been smoother and transitioned better into scenes, the film is a tad over-stretched in the final act and it could've been shorter. However, with its rude, raunchy yet very funny humour, the film is very funny helped by the witty script. The idea for the story is a good one, and works wonderfully in two-thirds of the movie, it is well filmed and directed and has a memorable soundtrack. The cast are great, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are great together and both give some of their best work of their careers. Rachel McAdams, Christopher Walken, Isla Fisher and Jane Seymour also impress. The characters are clichéd in a sense, but they are also examples of those that you learn to love the more you see the film. Overall, a lot of fun. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Good Party,"Once it gets going, this is a pretty standard date movie: Boy gets girl, there's a problem (almost always with dishonesty or misunderstanding) so guy loses girl, then guy gets girl back (often at the last minute). So far as the story, the only innovation is humor that is broader and bluer than usual unless you are a ""Meet the Fockers"" type of person.I was interested because of the folding type: Actors playing characters who are acting roles. But that is so common now you can buy templates for your scriptwriting software.Two interesting things. One is mundane: date movies usually show you nothing that doesn't advance the plot. We actually count on this fact: if we know something we expect the characters to know as well. Advancement of the story in this genre includes the necessity that that all is revealed at the end. Whatever we are told, the girl discovers at the end; it is just a matter of her catching up with us.In this case, we are told horrible things about the boyfriend that remain a secret just for the audience. That's unusual and was certainly engineered.The other thing, the thing I actually liked, was the extended preface. We learn that these guys crash weddings, and then for 15 or 20 minutes we attend a dozen or more with them.This sort of dancing and fun usually comes at the end of a date movie. Here it is at the beginning. It is so well assembled that I think they brought in a more professional team just for that. This is so expertly edited that I even surmise that it was done later to help the movie, which is thin story-wise and ordinary in other respects.Possibly some side material about the mother, the oldest daughter (whose wedding introduces the family) and the gay son was removed to make room.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Starts with a bang ... ends with a whimper,"In this unsurprising storyline (with a comedic twist), John (Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince) are, ironically, wedding counselors/mediators who look forward to weddings more than Christmas. Why? Because weddings give them a chance to take advantage of emotionally vulnerable women, feast on free food, dance all night, and take their libido to the next level. Both are stylish, smooth talking mid/late 30 somethings that have bedposts notched neck high. The film and editing are fast and furious until John has a moment of clarity and falls for Claire (played beautifully by the modest Rachel McAdams), the daughter of a powerful senator. Claire is in a relationship and this only heightens the chase. It's this moment, when we discover that John really is more than meets the eye that the film starts to turn a corner into ""serious comedy"" and all the gut-busting humor is left behind. Bit roles by Christopher Walken and Will Farrell can't save this movie from going stale. The ending is tied neatly in a bow, and with all the hype and potential, the morning after leaves a dull headache.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Quality Crashing,"I have been hearing rumors about this movie for a long time, about its themes, some ""colorful"" scenes and a audiences' reactions. The preview wasn't as exciting as I expected, but I have always been fun of Wilson and Vaughn, and who could resist the pairing of Walken and Seymour? So I decided to spend my hard earned money and partake of the communal experience. In the end, I have to say that I wasn't completely disappointed because this film has some truly hilarious moments, and the chemistry between some of the principals works very well. It even has some classy cinematography and art direction... even some really good acting.The concept behind he film works very well because there is the depiction of friendship and the various relationships in the family members feels real and honest; though leaving out the artistic brother wouldn't have made much of an impact.Wilson and McAdams have work very well together, taking us along as they develop a sweet and touching relationship. There are some genuinely touching moments as they take simple walks along the fantastic estates.True, I attended this film, expecting a raunchy, crass, hilarious, and downright bawdy time, and there were scenes that fulfilled my expectations. What made me enjoy the movie even more was that the filmmakers considered that taking those aspects too far would have resulted in overkill and another dumb teenager flick. Their film was 90% good, and I just wished that the unexpected and rather unwelcome one-note cameo in the movie had been taken out. It wasn't necessary, reeked of lack of talent and almost sank the film. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are good actors and comedians, capable of emoting emotions beyond loud and simian screams. Maybe the inclusion of the character in question will highlight this performer's fault and lead to his eventual removal from a business that has suffered in the past year of lack of originality and too much reliance in marketing research that takes the usual way out. True, a series like ""Faces of Death"" provokes some type of sick attraction, but that doesn't necessarily reflect quality or talent. Please, stop overpaying vulgar and simplistic performers and bring back what really works: talent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Incredibly Funny,"John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) are life-long friends who have made a hobby out of lying to get into wedding receptions, where they pick up vulnerable women with even more lies. Their plans to crash the upscale wedding of a high-profile politician (Christopher Walken) go awry when John falls in love with the politician's daughter (Rachel McAdams) and the two guys end up spending the weekend with her familywho just happen to be completely nuts!Wedding Crashers is easily the funniest film of 2005. It's constantly hilarious and it's not completely immature. The premise is pretty creative and original. The film is not just filled with cheap jokes and toilet humor. There's actually a pretty mature love story to be found here as well. In all honestly, the script isn't that great but the film works really well because of the cast. The actors bring life into their characters and most of them give funny performances. Vince Vaughn is the true star of Wedding Crashers. His over the top performance is very funny. Some people may find him annoying though. Owen Wilson also gives a funny performance. He just wasn't as good as Vince but he holds his own. Together, Vaughn and Wilson have great chemistry and really make their scenes with one another really funny.Rachel McAdams is one of the best young actresses working today. She appeared in three movies in 2005 and this one was the best. Her performance is pretty good and it's so easy to love this girl. Christopher Walken does his usual routine and he gives an okay performance. He isn't as funny as everyone else though. Isla Fisher is also another talented young actress. She comes out of no where and gives a very funny performance. Jane Seymour is underused which is too bad because she's pretty funny. Bradley Cooper was okay, nothing really special though. Not all of the film is perfect. I think the running time is too long. Long comedies rarely work out and while this one does, it could have still been edited. Also, the ending is kind of cheesy which is okay but a little unexpected. Will Ferrell makes a cameo and let's just say that it was not needed. It wasn't completely bad but he seemed to be trying way too hard. I really think that he's just an average comedian and nothing really special. One last thing, the film is pretty funny yet it doesn't have that great of a repeat value, at least for me. In the end, Wedding Crashers is worth checking out.

"satisfactory romantic comedy, brings its laughs, and its predictability in tow","Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, the stars bringing this vehicle to theaters (there are other notables in the case, but not with the kind of draw of these two), are very talented, and usually pretty amusing. Wilson, for my money, is the subtler of the two, and is more of the leading man, while Vaughn is usually over-the-top in his double-talk, and garners some laughs even when some fall flat. They take the film Wedding Crashers and make it watchable, along with some supporting actors playing strange characters. It's not as wild as one might expect from the trailers, and as a 'date' movie it's rather predictable.The opening twenty minutes is close to genius, by introducing the audience into this care-free, inspired montage of Wilson and Vaughn crashing the weddings, enjoying the celebrations, and going to bed with many women. It's not laugh out loud funny, but it garners a few small laughs, and it a very good set-up for what seems to be a film in this vein. It's not quite the case- we get a story that sort of goes on auto-pilot (to put it another way, I've seen a story like this many times over in mainstream romantic comedies) wherein Vaughn gets dragged into staying for a day with the daughter (Isla Fisher, perhaps the best overall funny performance) of the Secretary of Treasury (Christopher Walken, of all people), and Wilson goes along as he tries to woo another daughter (Rachel McAdams, a beauty no doubt) who is already in a relationship with a alpha-male guy (Bradley Cooper). This is when formula takes over.While the laughs are there, including a crazy dinner scene (it's like a 30's screwball comedy crossed with American Pie for this scene, one of the funniest), a demented quasi-rape of Vaughn on his first night at the Clearys, and some other amusing parts sprinkled throughout the film, there are flaws. For one, it does go a little longer than it should- a couple of scenes could've been cut, or at least trimmed. At two hours, a romp of a romantic comedy shouldn't feel this over-long (a lot of it for the story of Wilson and McAdams' characters, who have good chemistry, but don't have much room to go in the formula). Another problem is under-developed, or non-developed characters.Take the character Cooper plays, Sack- he's been with Claire (McAdams) for over three years, and yet she is everything that he isn't. He's a one-dimensional villain, someone who is so obvious that it doesn't leave much room for conflict or second guessing about where the film will go. This goes for the Walken character as well, who seems mis-cast in a film where his odd comic genius and timing could come in well, but he doesn't bring much to the table aside from maybe one laugh (perhaps not intentional). Ironically, two characters who score a lot of points when they appear on screen, Will Ferrel as the Wedding Crasher legend Chaz, and Keir O'Donnell as the closet-freak/brother Todd, get very little time to bring funnier bits (they're stuck, again, in the traction of the screenplay, who do what they can in the time given).Wedding Crashers did give a couple of surprises, and it is gleeful, dumb fun for most of the way. But when it comes to the last quarter it starts to drag, the laughs become more diminished, and it becomes more of waiting for the last scene than being entertained. The whole aspect of the lying theme of the film fits in, yet really as story devices. In short, it's a film that brings in its moments well, and gives some good room for Wilson and Vaughn to work in (Vaughn, whom I've always gotten the least of laughs in the pack of Wilsons, Ferrell, and Stiller in their films, actually makes good on a lot of the set-ups and pay-offs of the absurdities). But the script and actors tend to stumble as much as they make it entertaining. 6/10 or a B-",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

hit-and-miss comedy,"John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey have come up with a full-proof scheme to get women to sleep with them: they go to weddings of total strangers, pass themselves off as distant relatives of either the bride or the groom, charm the living daylights out of the other guests, then put the make on any pretty young thing that happens to come their way. And up till now, John and Jeremy have been able to pull off their little ruse pretty much without a hitch - until, that is, the day they decide to crash the wedding of the daughter of the Treasury Secretary of the United States. Then all hell breaks loose ""The Wedding Crashers"" is a comedy vehicle built for speed. The dialogue comes so fast and furious that it's occasionally hard to absorb everything the characters are saying. David Dobkin has followed suit in his direction, keeping the film going full-throttle at all points. That's the good news about ""The Wedding Crashers."" The bad news is that, as the movie goes on, the jokes and setups have a tendency to become a trifle strained, forced and labored, and the laughs begin to diminish as a result. It's not that there aren't some very funny moments in ""The Wedding Crashers,"" just that there aren't nearly as many as there should be.As the two party crashers, Owen Wilson takes the role of the smooth-talking romantic lead, while Vince Vaughn gets to be the cynical victim of circumstances that such buddy comedies seem to require. Both are very good, but Vaughn, in particular, hits all the right notes as a man who finally meets his match with a girl (charmingly played by Isla Fisher) who has no intention of letting him get away from her after just a one night stand. Rachel McAdams, Christopher Walken, Jane Seymour, Rebecca De Mornay, Dwight Yoakam, Henry Gibson and Ellen Albertini Dow - who, apparently, needs to make an appearance in any movie that has the word ""wedding"" in its title - round out the cast. And, ah yes, there is a fairly large, albeit uncredited, cameo appearance by none other than Will Ferrell late in the film.This is no bell-ringer of a comedy, to be sure, but it is at least harmless and watchable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I must say well done!,"I was very much impressed with this comedy. The basic idea of this movie makes me laugh. I was worried that the movie would just be two guys goofing off and sleeping with different woman at weddings. This movie however had a very good story line. It was about 2 guys who attend weddings for free food, and to meet girls. I felt like I knew the characters, and that means that the writers and directors and actors them self did a good job getting the personality of the characters out. I was however disappointed in the fact that the ending was very sudden and seemed ""untimely"" if you will and I think must will agree with that statement. This movie is a must watch for any fan of what I like to call ""easy comedies,"" meaning you don't have to think much. I would recommend this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Owen Wilson & Vince Vaughn Funny Together,"Wilson & Vaughn are not house hold names as a comedy team. In this movie, they play off each other very well. The film is about crashing weddings and there is lots of fun to be had at every wedding. The unavoidable problems begin though when our team crashes too many weddings.After a while, they start running into people at other weddings who saw them at the earlier ones. Then, they go to a high ranking government officials wedding (excellently acted by Christopher Walken). This wedding takes the wheel off our teams relationship & wedding crashing plans. I also have to admit this family is one of the looniest families I have seen since Meet The Parents.The jokes come at a good pace & even though this film runs longer than many comedy films, it really does not drag. Sometimes good comedy can run longer than 90 minutes & this film proves it. The women cast in this film are as strong as the male cast & Wilson & Vaughn get excellent support from them too. Jane Seymour is great though her role is limited to a few scenes.Watch for a famous UN-credited cameo at the end by Will Farrell & enjoy this film. The DVD 8 1/2 minute longer version is the one I watched & it is good though not for the young kiddies with the additional material.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A comic masterpiece from start to finish.,"A pitch-perfect comedy full of laughs and heart from start to finish. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson play off of each other as natural and easily as Abbot and Costello. They really are the perfect comedic duo. Wilson's confidence and heart of gold combined with Vaughn's supremely charismatic hate of the world. All of the performances in the film are golden. Rachel McAdams is so sweet and adorable that you feel like she's the girl next door that you've been in love with your entire life. Christopher Walken is an actor with such warmth and charisma that it's impossible not to love him. The real highlight of the film though is Isla Fisher. She is so natural and convincing in one of the most difficult roles of all time, that is scares the hell out of me. I'm scared to ever meet her because of how convincing she was. Will Ferrell delivered arguably the greatest cameo of all time. Even Bradley Cooper was brilliant as the chauvinistic, over the top jackass who is stealing the adorable, perfect girl. I really love everything about this film. I die in laughter from start to finish every time I see it. It's so quotable as well. My only real complaint is that it's pretty one-dimensional but that can be forgotten with how perfect of a comedy it is. Vince Vaughn is really a comic genius. His style of striking, smooth quick-paced, charismatic cynicism is more brilliant than any comedic style I've ever seen. He really is nothing short of a miracle to comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Not so great, but not bad","This movie is not perfect as a romantic comedy, as the romantic part is really insignificant. Nor is it a guys comedy, because the wedding crashing bit is only shown in the start of the movie and then discarded as a non popular activity. It's not bad as a comedy, but I didn't laugh at it.Vince Vaughn is a hyperactive as ever, Owen Wilson is... Owen Wilson. The same calm humor and wacky face, Rachel McAdams is incredibly cute, while Christopher Walken is playing a tiny role that doesn't bring him justice. He is not psychotic in this movie, though. Not too much :)There is no reason for me to go over the plot, it's as predictable as they ever were, but the bad thing about the movie is that it is composed of three major parts that have little to do with each other. First we meet these guys, ready to go uninvited to weddings and prey on the brides maids, then they go the THE wedding we go into ""Meet the Parents"" mode, then they are ""discovered"" and we go into the part where they feel sorry about what they did and regretful and stuff, then happy ending. And that's it.Conclusion: it's a relaxing comedy (read no brainer), a tad to long (2 hours), and slightly romantic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wedding Crashers A Hilarious Comedy,"Wedding Crashers was a hilarious comedy mainly because of the great performances by Owen Wilson and especially Vince Vaughn. Director David Dobkin is admirable in making this movie about two best friends who enjoy to spend their time crash weddings and picking up chicks. Owen Wilson and Vincent Vaughn both made this movie worth seeing because of their great comic chemistry with each other. Their scenes together are worth seeing it alone. The film also stars a more restrained Christopher Walken, Rachel McAdams, Isla Fisher, and Bradley Cooper who are equally impressive as the supporting characters. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles as well. A few of the supporting actors provide some comic relief to to movie but most of the laughs come from Wilson and Vaughn as their characters find themselves in one hilarious situation after another. The pacing was a little slow at times but the rest of the film made up for it's few flaws. I was very impressed with Wedding Crashers because it's one of the best comedies I've seen in quite sometime. My parents even liked it which really surprised me. Overall Wedding Crashers has plenty of humor and exceptional performances by the cast (Wilson and especially Vaughn) making this comedy worth seeing because is sure to please almost any fan of the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Do people actually crash weddings like this in real life?,This is definitely quite and eventful movie packed with some crazy moments. The plot was intriguing right from the beginning where you get a bit of a montage of some of the weddings the guys have crashed and the crazy moments from them. You think surely there luck is going to run out and it did as one of the guys starts catching feelings for one of the girls. One of the things I liked about the movie is the characters and how crazy some of them can turn out to be. The one thing that annoyed me was that it felt unrealistic how Jeremy was still allowed to get married even after the family found out he is a wedding crasher.,6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I do...,"I was lucky enough to see a sneak peak of this at New Line Cinema about 4 months ago, and it was very very funny. It starts off a little slow, with Vince Vaughn carrying the film based on the fact that almost anything he does is funny... but then the film really finds itself a little bit later and the laughs begin. The further the movie goes the funnier it gets. And it honestly looks like something we all can do and have a blast doing it. I recommend this to others and I plan on actually plan on seeing it again when it comes out... Although this time I have to pay for it.go see wedding crashers",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A 2005 Relic That Doesn't Stand Up Over Time,"Sure, sure, we all have wonderful recollections of the early aughts with the heyday of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn fresh faced with quirky quips for the millenium, but I'm telling you this is a fizzler. Specifically: the story. Awful. Just dreadful. The arc of the characters to forgive and forget over their historic baseless shenanigans. I get suspension of disbelief remains the common element to fiction and film, but enough. The premise is as lame as a throwback stinker I had the misfortune of sitting through recently in Fred Estaire's ""Royal Wedding"" about 2 sibling unbetrothed dance partners invited to perform at - you guessed it - a royal wedding, only to walk away moments after said wedding getting married to people they'd only recently met. Wtf! Ten kinds of nope. The only redeeming quality of ""Wedding Crashers"" is the witty barbs Vaughn consistently brings, however they aren't enough to prop up this tired trope to see its way to a timeless classic. Sadly this matrimonial missive ultimately misfires.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
19th Century Parlor Farce,"Two hours into Wedding Crashers, Will Farrell appeared as Chazz Reinhold and true comic mastery ensued. Till then, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn struggled to hold up what is essentially a 19th Century parlor farce. Wedding are funny or at least ironic because they promise what is essentially impossible, ""perfect union"" between man and woman. As all successful married couples know, divorce or murder is a toilet seat-up-moment away.Farce or screwball comedy introduces stressful situations and cross-purpose motivations amidst a large cast of diverse characters. They bounce off each other as if billiard balls. Wilson and Vaughn crash weddings to bed teary-eyed women in a moment of marital insecurity. The bride has her man, but what of the single gals? They are society's failures. They are also horny; hence, the premise of the film. We laugh at the Senator's family, each one a character except for Owen's new love, Claire. She's like Marilyn in the Munsters, normal, while her nympho sister, Claire's jock-nut fiancé, the insane-gay-artiste bro, and all the bedded bimbos, are nuts.Hollywood used to produce screwball comedies during the Depression years to cheer folks up. Carole Lombard, Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant and Clark Gable all took a turn at the misunderstandings that create situation comedy, farce. Perhaps we need cheering up again. After all, there is a war going on and your mortgage is astronomical. Slip the DVD in honey and let's have a laugh.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Good, but Should Have Been Better","""Wedding Crashers"" has some laugh-out-loud funny scenes.Vince Vaughn, as a hulking, earthy, wildman and Owen Wilson as a more thoughtful, cuter wildman, are winning and perfectly cast for the roles they play. Both charmed me, in different ways.The premise -- sex-hungry playboys crash weddings in order to exploit women's sentimentality in order to have sex with them -- is really good, both goofy, for the sake of crazy movie scenes -- here are our boys pretending to be Jewish, Irish, and Chinese! and profound -- can casual sex be satisfying in the long haul? -- for the sake of a deeper theme.I did laugh and smile and the naked breasts and obscene language that got so much play in the press didn't bug me too much.It's just that, given the premise and stars of the caliber of Vaughn and Wilson, this movie could have really been a classic along the lines of ""Some Like It Hot,"" and it isn't.There is some sloppy editing, with joke's set-ups obviously missing, and dead scenes that could have been deleted. There is some very flat-footed direction.The writing is pretty slack in places.And the female lead is a complete blank slate.Why not cast a female star with as much charisma as Owen Wilson? Why cast a non-entity? Why not write her some good lines? Why not give her something to do? Why not provide Owen Wilson with SOME reason for falling in love with her? After all, in a classic like ""Some Like It Hot,"" Marilyn Monroe contributed as much to the film's impact as Jack Lemmon.The movie's digs on women are often funny, but the filmmaker's inability to cast a strong female star or write for a female character is genuinely tragic, and weakened the film.On a different topic: This movie is a treasure trove of clues about the Political Correctness Zeitgeist.Vince Vaughn, after being aggressively pursued by a woman he has picked up, refers to himself as a ""rape"" victim, and compares himself to ""Jody Foster in 'The Accused.'"" There is a scene where a very creepy gay man takes advantage of a straight man being tied up in bed, and tries to sexually violate him.In spite of the movie's homophobia, the only true love in the movie is that between its two male leads, Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

This wedding crashing-thing looks like fun to me!,"After seeing the trailer, I really looked forward seeing this movie. I wasn't disappointed after seeing ""Wedding Crashers"". It was very funny and Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are an hilarious on-screen duo. I really liked Rachel McAdams (The Notebook) as well. But, beside all these positive things, I think the movie might be a bit ""overhyped"" as well. It's good and funny, but it isn't extraordinary hilarious. I've seen other comedies, as good as this one, getting a much lower rating. But of course, that's only my humble opinion.I can't think of any reason not to see this movie. It's a fine comedy. Christopher Walker was great as well. I also thought the few scenes of the grandmother were hilarious, as well as the weird brother of the girls. The story was fine as well. I don't know if this wedding crashing-thing really exist, but it sure looks like fun to me!But this wasn't Owen Wilson's most hilarious role, I think. I loved ""Meet The Parents"" a lot more than this one.

Anyway, this movie is worth watching as well.7,5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not a bad flick but falsely advertised,"Must say this movie let me down. The way it was marketed, it was billed as being another Old School, another sophomoric raunchfest. It was, for about 15 minutes.So I heard about a movie starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn (spoiler, Will Ferrell is in it as well). These guys have been part of some of the funnier movies of the past five years. So why would this one be any different? You have three of the fab five (Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller being the others). and more often than not, these guys hit the mark. With movies such as Bottlerocket, Starsky and Hutch, Dodgeball, Zoolander, and the aforementioned Old School, any movie that has at least two of these guys is usually a winner. They stay away from that Hollywood sentimentality and just have some good old fashioned fun. Not the case this time.Here, you see two wedding crashers, crashing weddings, then they go for the ultimate crash; going after the daughter of the Treasury Secretary. (By the way, you don't see the married couple much after the wedding). Sounds like it'd be a good time. The actual wedding scene, specifically the toast by the maid of honor, was very discomforting. Were they trying to make a statement there, it seemed legless.So after the marriage, the crashers are loved by the secretary's family (mainly the can't get enough lovin daughter), so off they go for a weekend getaway. The football scene, though kind of cheesy, was funny, due in large part to Zack, played by Bradley Cooper. He's great as the arrogant boyfriend of the knock em dead gorgeous Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams). And the nymph daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher) was fun as well, though she looked like she should be wearing a cap and gown for her high school graduation (can't believe she's nearly 30).But this movie really became mopey after a while. The whole time Owen Wilsons character grew more and more irritating. ""Oh, I've known this girl for three days and now I'm in love with her."" Please, you're a gigolo, go get girls. I wanted to see the party antics of a wedding crasher, I didn't care to witness him finding out that he's errored in his past ways. But that's what I got.Might I add that Jane Seymour has aged like fine wine. Her character is rather naughty throughout and to see her look that way in her mid 50s, wow, she's been counting her carbs since being a Bond girl. Sadly, Christopher Walken is a non factor in this movie. He's actually a very good comedic actor when he's not acting like Beelzebub. His lines were limited and he lacked the presence that he normally has. And frankly, playing a major US secretary, you'd think the guy would stand out a little bit more. Somehow he gets upstaged by two party crashers, no wait, make that one, one of them became a total sap.The movie certainly started with potential. The beginning party scenes were a good time but they jumped back and forth so much that you missed the fun and they were over entirely too quickly. So yes, I must say it again, I was a bit let down by this movie. Even the ending credits had loud party music that would have been fitting for a party movie. And Vince Vaughn didn't seem as Vaughnesque this time. He was pretty funny but his acting got really campy at times (especially during the ""bedroom"" scene). He usually plays a wisecracker, and he had his moments, but I wouldn't classify this role as vintage.This movie could be a breakout role for Rachel McAdams. I don't know how good of a comedic actress she actually is, you don't see that from her in this flick, but she has a face and presence that lights up the screen. I'm sure she'll be relegated to romantic comedies (which this film essentially became) but nevertheless, she has a bright future ahead. Will Ferrell added some spark to the movie but his character seemed like a self-parody. He's a guy that's at the top of his game but he's running the risk of becoming clichéd. True, it's made him a rich man, but I do see signs of his gimmick growing tiresome.POSSIBLE SPOILERI think my biggest problem with this flick is that it has an identity crisis. At times, like the first 15 minutes, it's a party movie. The guys are drinking, dancing, sleeping around, and throughout the movie, you see the party side come up. But somewhere during this project, a Hollywood exec got the idea that one of the crashers had to see his errors and meet a woman that would change him. And please, would any decent girl want a guy after finding out he's a fraud? (Well, maybe they would). The meltdown of Wilson's character before that was somewhat believable, it's easy to go insane over a girl, but I found it kind of disturbing. The final scene summed up the movie; awkward, confused, and in the end, unsatisfying.So I don't think the movie knew its audience. It was marketed as a party movie but grew into a frustrated love story that couples could enjoy. I don't mind love stories but that certainly wasn't what I expected watching this flick. There was a fair amount of T&A mixed in and since this is the 21st century, some homosexuality had to be mixed in (that scene was pretty funny, though it didn't completely hit the mark). I hope the next time Vaughn and Wilson collaborate, they remember their audience. Some of the movies I mentioned at the start were funny because they didn't get sidetracked by a hokey love story. They were films that were meant to entertain. This movie could have been that, should have been that, but in the end, it wasn't.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wonderful!,"I will not bother with a synopsis, but I just saw a sneak preview of this movie tonight and had to write how much I loved it.Being a huge fan of both Vince Vaughn and Rachel McAdams might make me more partial to have chosen to see it originally, but it was both sweet and laugh out loud hilarious. In the vein of Old School, Anchorman & Starsky & Hutch, only with romance and quirky families thrown in to the mix. I think the audience for Wedding Crashers has the potential to be broader for that very reason. Vaughn and Wilson have a chemistry as lifelong friends, as do Wilson and McAdams as love interests. Supporting character roles were well cast and provided great framework.See it on the 15th!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Funny, stupid - everything you'd expect...","This was really good.If you don't like vulgarity and you like your comedy to be sophisticated then don't watch this because it is way off on both those counts. A lot of the comedy is purile and stupid, but it still manages to be funny. A huge amount of the credit for that goes down to Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson: two naturally funny people who work extremely well together. You get the impression that a lot of the jokes came directly from them - or if not then the writer did a great job of judging the people they were writing for. It all feels very natural and that makes it very easy to laugh where you're supposed to laugh and cringe where you're supposed to cringe.All the actors do a good job of playing the parts they were assigned and they've managed to squeeze a love story into this shameless smut vehicle without it getting too gooey and sentimental (which would have felt completely out of place).I wasn't expecting too much, but I was most impressed. It's worth watching for Vaughn and Wilson alone. Without them playing those parts I suspect it wouldn't have worked, but it does - so who cares?

Such kind movie is really eye smoothing. I will not say it is an amazing film, but for a time being it can really clear away the audience from all kinds of anxiety. In the movie there is a scene at the dining table, and trust me, I don't remember when I laughed so loud. That was really hilarious how Gloria tried to seduce Jeremy. This movie was released a long ago, for that time being story could be relatable, but if I compare with today story might not catch up.

"A typical ""Frat Pack"" movie","I have a huge appreciation for Rachel McAdams, I think she is fantastic actress and hope she has a long and movie-filled career. McAdams was my main reason for watching this film, although I had many people tell me how good it was. I, however, was not overly impressed. Although I think Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are good comedians, I felt that their performances here were sub-par, and their characters could have been played by any member of the ""Frat Pack"", or another comedian too.The premise of the film is an interesting idea, it basically consists of John (Wilson) and Jeremy (Vaughn) crashing weddings to hook up with chicks. Eventually, after a long opening scene, they crash the wedding of an important family - the Cleary's - and John falls for Claire (McAdams), who is engaged to Zachary Lodge (played by the hilarious and gorgeous Bradley Cooper) who is arrogant and controlling, while Jeremy becomes subject to the unwanted attentions of Gloria Cleary (Isla Fisher of ""Home & Away"" fame, who gives a terrific performance here).The typical antics follow, with the guys dealing with their respective situations, and eventually having a fall-out between themselves, though the movie closes with a happy ending all 'round, well, for most people. The film was highly predictable, and at times boring. The rest of the cast were mixed - Christopher Walken gives the first performance of his that I actually liked, the lovely Jane Seymour was severely under-used, Will Ferrell was annoying, Keir O'Donnell's character was rather pointless and poor Rebecca DeMornay, why she subjected herself to such a bit part is beyond me.Watch this film if you like, but you may be subjected to severe boredom.

Funniest wedding movie of all time!,"""Wedding Crashers"" is a 2005 comedy film directed by David Dobkin and starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn as two friends who crash weddings to meet and hook up with women.

What a stupid movie.... but....,"... so much fun. Yeah, plot is thin, there are no special effects, there's nothing new to see here, but it's a great date movie. I always enjoy Christopher Walken on screen. I normally can't stand Owen Wilson, but he's a bit more subdued here and the role fits him.For those who like to analyze movies, let's get to the point: The first 6-7 minutes of the movie give us a riotous montage of our two protagonists doing what they do best: picking up chicks. It's rubbed in our faces. This totally frees us to spend the rest of the movie enjoying watching our heroes pulled out of their comfort zones and having to cope with... OMG! relationships!

The talent...,"It's only a matter of time that the supporting characters begin to shine and get their own movies. Agree or not, Owen Wilson was always the shadow of Ben Stiller. They have something in common; they always seem to be doing the same.

He is one of those actors who have always been talented, but time gave him a wider recognition. He had to be in some determined films so he could be now working as continuously as he does, and end up paired with guys like Owen Wilson, in films like ""Wedding Crashers"".They make an excellent team. They are two types of comedians and the writers of the film (Steve Faber and Bob Fisher) created two types of characters (Wilson plays John, Vaughn plays Jeremy); two working friends that ""crash weddings"". That's the expression and what it implies is shown in the movie; extensively.There's one scene where both of them go to the ""first wedding of the season"", and they cry on purpose, invent names to be part of the family; sticking their eyes on two women, so they can later gain them with cheap strategies that include dancing or being nice with children or grannies, to ultimately end up with them in bed.After that first routine, loud music starts playing and the routine repeats itself a lot of times, with quick cuts and lots of different images, as if it was an extended trailer. It could be a waste of time, you could see it as a sign of laziness; but not if you understand that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and it is made with dedication.Director David Dobkin makes sure of keeping his characters and his comedic timing real. Therefore this is the most natural comedy I've seen in a long time, because there's not a trace of gross humor or bad taste in it. If there is, it is very subtle, because for once, there seems to be a little more of concern for the characters.Consider John and Claire (Rachel McAdams), two sarcastic persons, not too serious about life; they click. But she is taken, by Zack (Bradley ""I always have the same hair cut, I always look the same"" Cooper), man from a wealthy family and loved by her father (a very classy Christopher Walken). However, after a series of events, John wakes up in the middle of the night and walks towards Claire's room and then goes back. Instantly, Claire can't sleep and she does the same thing.Although is hard to believe inside the film, something's happening; and the movie is good because we think it can be possible. The cast spreads laughs all around. McAdams is beautiful as always and charming as ever, Vaughn is completely effortless and what I said about Wilson that, like Stiller (and I don't like it), he always does the same thingBut you know what? I love it! ""Wedding Crashers"" is a good contemporary comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Hide the Bridemaids,"""Wedding Crashers"" is an oddity. It's a film I appreciate, but not one I particularly like. It has all the makings of a great comedy: witty dialogue, raunchy humor and Owen Wilson, a genius actor. All these pieces mesh perfectly, and yet I just was not thrilled. By the end I had the odd feeling that my soul was completely drained, and I lurched to my car like a zombie.The film makes good points about the nature of relationships and expertly satirizes guys like it's titular characters, men who go to weddings uninvited to score chicks. There was even a wonderful scene early on featuring costar Vince Vaughn delivering a rapid-fire speech about the ""does she or doesn't she like me"" nature of first dates that deserves applause as a short masterpiece.The real failing, I think, is having Owen Wilson's character, John, fall in love. The first portion of the film, showing John and buddy Jeremy actually crashing weddings is hilarious and quick paced. Then John meets Claire Cleary, falls in love, and goes on the worn-out mission of one-upping her secretly evil boyfriend, Sack. The laughs quickly fade in favor of straight-up romance, returning only occasionally to liven things up. Jeremy's story line of being raped by his obsessive wedding date and, later, her gay brother is good stupid fun in the style of ""There's Something About Mary"" and other films of its ilk. The main story, which amounts to John making moon-eyes at Claire and Claire returning the sentiment as Sack schemes, would be an average romantic movie on it's own, but it drags down what was a great comedy.The acting is hit-or-miss. Vince Vaughn is superb as the beleaguered Jeremy. His physical comedy is tempered with his verbal wit to perfectly balance the two. Isla Fisher is also great as Jeremy's obsessed wedding crashing victim Gloria, who goes all out to get her man even though he's decidedly done with her.Owen Wilson, one of my favorite actors, is listless and dim as John. Romance is not Owen's thing at all, and it kills me to say he was horribly bad. But that's what it is. Rachael McAdams and Bradley Cooper are stereotypical and mundane as Claire and Sack. They phoned in their performances and, man oh man, it shows and it hurts.Christopher Walken, who is normally hilarious, is forced to check his comedic persona at the door to play the straight-laced Commerce Secretary Cleary. Walken could have saved this film if he'd been allowed to show his zany side.I really do appreciate every aspect of the film. It has great comedy, fair enough romance, and some brilliant acting to cover for all the bad stuff. I just can't bring myself to give it a fresh rating. Maybe romance and comedy just don't belong together (that would explain ""Just Married"" and every Julia Roberts film aside from ""Sleeping with the Enemy""). I thought 'this is pretty good', but I didn't feel it.""Wedding Crashers"" is what you'd call an 'aborted masterpiece'. It starts strong, and then shoots itself dead half-way through. The second half of this film reminds me of a line from Errol Morris' ""Gates of Heaven"": ""There's your dog. Your dog's dead. But where's the thing that made it move? It had to be something...didn't it?"" This dog died too soon, and I'm not sure what happened to the thing that made it move in the first place. It's a captivating mystery.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Perhaps It's THE Funniest Wedding Comedy,"David Dobkins's 'Wedding Crashers' is a laugh riot right from the start. Pretty much all the jokes are laugh out loud hilarious. It is an over-the-top comedy but what makes this one miles ahead of the likes of 'Meet The Parents', 'Bedazzled' etc is that the comic tracks fit the story and the film itself has excellent repeat value (which isn't easy with comedy). I had seen it in theatres during first viewing but even today it felt just as fresh. The story itself is quite new.While the dialogues and situations are highly amusing, a comedy movie requires actors with comic flair and everyone here is wonderfully cast. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are awesome as the crasher duo. The two actors appear to be really comfortable to work together and their off-screen friendship may have something to do with how well they click together on screen. The ravishing Rachel McAdams is cast as Wilson's love interest and she doesn't have much to do with comedy but nonetheless delivers a charming performance. Then there is a cute Isla Fisher as the oversexed, clingy, wild 'virgin', a sizzling Jane Seymour as the gorgeous but sexually starved hot mom and of course a delightful Christopher Walken as the clueless dad. There's also a funny appearance by Rebecca DeMornay at the beginning.The film also succeeds on the technical side. The sets look quite nice and rich. The music is comprised of an eclectic soundtrack and adds energy. The camera-work and editing is great.'Wedding Crashers' is funny as hell, perhaps one of my favourite over the top comedies from Hollywood, perhaps THE best wedding comedy. The humour is very adult thus watching it with your parents or with little children isn't exactly advisable but otherwise I'd recommend to watch the uncut version for more surprises.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A good laugh indeed,"I was always amazed by the wedding crash sport. I never could understand why wedding crashers are so seldom caught. I think that's maybe because they always chose crowded wedding parties where the bride's guests and family think they are groom's guests or relatives and vice versa. This bright comedy movie proves it again. Two philanderers, despite the fact they are not exactly badly off in life, amuse themselves crashing wedding parties galore to eat and drink freely and above all pick up ladies and girls to take to bed at first opportunity. However one day things turn out badly since not only they are caught red-handed but one of them falls in love with the bride's sister who is engaged to another guy also present in the party and after they manage to be invited for a stay in the father of the bride's house at the seaside under false identities. This is a simple story but it develops itself in a series of funny moments with some hilarious gags which will make you laugh a lot. I only didn't like very much the choice of Vince Vaughn for the role of Jeremy Grey one of the womanizer guys. He is a bit too common for a seducer at high society level but anyway he tries do his his best at it. But the most important thing is that this movie is apt to raise a good laugh indeed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Just filthy...and hysterical,"Two immature men--John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Gray (Vince Vaughn)--""crash"" weddings. They go to weddings uninvited, pretend they're part of the family--and proceed to bed as many women as possible. Then they crash the wedding of the Cleary family. Beckwith falls in love with Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams) but she has a real jerk of a boyfriend (Bradley Cooper) who is insanely jealous.Typical plot but it works! This film is a throwback to the adult comedies of the 1970s. It wears its R rating proudly and proceeds to throw as many sex jokes at you as possible (with the expected female nudity). The thing is all the jokes are funny! The cast is attractive, spirited and ready to go and give their all to this. Yes it's silly, VERY raunchy and predictable--but I loved it.Vaughn and Wilson are just great--they play off each other well and are GREAT at comedy. McAdams is beautiful and very good. Cooper is easily one of the most hateful villains I've ever seen in a comedy. Christopher Walken walks around in a daze (as usual) but isn't bad. Even Jane Seymour pops up and it's astonishing to see her talking dirty--but very funny too.Only a few minor complaints--there are plenty of dead spots in this picture--TOO many. Also it comes to a screeching halt when it gets serious. It also allows its main characters to be abused WAY too much. Vaughn and Wilson are repeatedly beaten by Cooper--I didn't find that funny--it got too violent. Wilson and Vaughn are jerks but we don't need to see them get beaten up like they do.So it IS a dirty movie so it's not for everybody (keep the kids AWAY from this one) but it is funny for those who are game. I give it an 8. It's a huge hit so let's hope there are more adult comedies coming out!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Not an instant classic, but very, very funny.","I never liked Owen Wilson. I think he is overrated, not funny, and usually just stinks up whatever film he is in, whether it is the already-bad I Spy or the well-done Shaghai movies with Jackie Chan. He was decent in the Meet the Parents movies, but because he had a small role. He is the main reason why I was not going to see this film. Plus, I knew nothing about Vince Vaughn at the time. After several weeks, several great reviews, and a ton of money and a ton of praise from audiences around the country, I finally decided to give it a try. This movie hands-down surprised me, I had no idea it was going to be this good. But, what ruins the film is what ruined Episode 3, made Fantastic 4 worse, and also what tainted Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. And also there was just too much Wilson, and certainly not enough Vaughn, who was certainly the funniest man in the movie.Wedding Crashers is about two men who crash weddings to pick up women but their biggest challenge comes at one particular wedding in which Owen Wilson's character John falls in love, meanwhile Vince Vaughn's character Jeremy has trouble staying away from the latest person he made love to. What was supposed to be a one-wedding visit turned into a weekend stay with a popular secretary (Christopher Walken) and his not-so-normal family. Throughout the entire film, you see John try to woo the already-taken Claire (played by the beautiful Rachel McAdams) and you see Jeremy have trouble containing Gloria (Isla Fisher). The movie is just amazingly hilarious; I had no idea that it was going to be such a hoot. There are many reasons why the movie is funny, but there is one actor that steals the show, and that is Vince Vaughn.Vince Vaughn has the best one-liners, the funniest moments, the best reactions, and also is the liveliest person on the screen. While Wilson kind of slows the movie and Walken does not put much effort into acting during this film, you see Vaughn get tied in bed, eat like a maniac, confess in a most hysterical way, and curse his way into one of the funniest performances I have seen in a very long time. The last time I saw someone steal an already funny movie from the first minute to the last minute is Jim Carrey back in 1994 when Dumb and Dumber came out. His scene in the dinner table just had everyone almost on the floor in laughter; it was so crude yet funny at the same time. This movie scores because it does not try too hard to be rater ""R"", it embraces the rating, by throwing every curse word at the right time, by applying the nudity only at the correct moments, and by sneaking in some of the most crude humor in films nowadays just as the film shows signs of slowing down. It did not try too hard to pass the PG-13 rating.This movie was just doing so well for so long, and then decides to throw in some romantic elements into the film. What really makes me upset is when directors and writers try to add another element into the film, therefore making it worse than it should be. Action movies throwing drama (Transporter 2) or sci-fi action movies throwing pointless and pitiful romance (Star Wars: Episode 2) some films suffer from putting something else into the film that it really did not need. This movie did not need any romance or touching moments, throughout the first 80 minutes it was a fast-paced unpredictable comedy and during the last parts of the film it disintegrated into a slow-paced, sappy romance story that was literally saved by a spectacular cameo. Owen Wilson's depression just takes away the happy mood most of the audience felt throughout the first half of the film, and it just dragged, which is what kept this movie from being among the best comedies I have ever seen. At least the ending made up a bit for the sappy and pathetic moments. Maybe it was because I was watching it by myself, I don't know, but this film was going so well before slowing down almost to a halt. Nonetheless, this movie will make you laugh, and Vince Vaughn will catch your attention for sure, he truly surprised me.Bottom Line: Excellent movie, but its dragging towards the end keeps it away from being among the funniest of all time, with the likes of Meet the Parents, Dumb and Dumber, Airplane, the Naked Gun movies, and some of the classic Mel Brooks films (not in any order). Wilson was not funny, but his partner, Vaughn certainly was. Superb performances by the lead females and also excellent job by the writers, who managed to throw in a lot of funny and silly moments throughout the first half of the film. The cast obviously had a blast making this film, and you will have a blast watching it. Wedding Crashers: join the party.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Eh?,"So... I liked the movie & it was funny like all of the other ones... but come on! Vincey baby.. he has so much talent but if he plays the same role in every movie, he'll far so far that even his performance in swingers couldn't save him. Also Owen Wilson needs to tone it down a little cause its obvious that hes the weaker of the Wilson brothers. The movie itself was a solid plot and it had Walkin in it and thats enough for me. However I thought some of the other characters were poor at best. The grandma? What a cheap laugh. I have loved the group that has formed over the last couple of years, but keep it fresh boys, keep it fresh.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Silly but excellent.,You either love this film or you hate it. Wilson and Vaughn are the perfect modern comedy duo like Abbott and Costello.

Decent film!,"Owen Wilson stars in this underrated comedy as a wedding crasher. His life is a free spirited, relaxed guy who likes to go out and live life. The movie starts out with his buddy (Vince Vaughn), who wants to crash a wedding. The movie doesn't beat around the bush and gets to the wedding quickly.The movie shows us very funny ways in how Owen is making an effort to get back on his feet and how Vince is dealing with wanting to pick up women.The directors do a good job in showing us the funny situations and putting a little bit of drama into some of the story. Owen Wilson puts a great touch onto his character and making it his own. Wilson makes his character look like he is that relaxed guy and makes us want to care for him and live life somewhat similar to Vince's This movie should be seen by anyone who is a fan of Owen Wilson's. Nobody can pull of this role as well as he does. It is worth seeing if it comes on TV or is available to rent.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Begins well but loses steam towards the end with a bland romance,This film begins well with some rapid fire banter from Vince Vaugn. He and Owen Wilson play a pair of lovable wedding crashers who get more than they bargained for after gatecrashing a politician's (Christopher Walken) wedding. The jokes and witticisms soon end as the film turns into a rather dull romance between a visibly disinterested Wilson and Rachel McAdam (who is stunningly beautiful). There are some cheap gay jokes and the whole thing feels like a wasted opportunity to go all out. There is a key cameo towards the end that turns out to be disappointing. Watchable on television/DVD.Overall 6/10,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Very Enjoyable!,"A very funny movie, with great acting by all, and a surprise cameo. Much better than Dodgeball, Anchorman, and other offerings from the same crew. The story was fairly compelling, and a great number of funny moments.Definitely not recommended for the under 15 set, generally quite lewd with a substantial amount of nudity as well as sexual themes. The language is also not at an elementary school level.The movie even sort of makes a point by the end, something that is often missing in slapsticky comedies from this crew.All in all, an enjoyable flick.

It's best to just turn off your brain and not think too much as you watch this one.,"John and Jeremy (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn) are NOT nice guys...despite the film trying to say this in a roundabout way. They spend much of their free time crashing weddings. Well, it's not just for the food or alcohol but because women are vulnerable there and make easy pickings. Again, they are NOT nice guys...they are creeps.After showing the guys going to many weddings and banging a lot of women, the pair sneak in to the wedding of some of elite....the daughter of a US presidential secretary! There, oddly, the pair really fit in well....and they both eventually end up falling in love...for real.Again...turn off your brain. Creepy guys like John and Jeremy do not suddenly change and make good husband material....do NOT take this as a message from the film!!! But if you don't think at all and just want a laugh, the film is strangely endearing and fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Vinny V Is On Fire,"This is a tough one to review. 'Wedding Crashers' has too many plot-driven scenes where no one acts in a remotely realistic way. But it's pretty funny (and, for once, the studio didn't wuss out and remove all the profanity & nudity). The unique talents of Christopher Walken, Jane Seymour, and even co-star Owen Wilson are almost completely wasted. But co-star Vince Vaughn is hilarious and he steals his own movie (if that's possible). There are an equal number of bads & goods in this flick and director David Dobkin isn't creative enough to minimize the wrong ones while maximizing the right ones. But I laughed.Unless you have a chemical aversion to the fast-talking ingenuity of Vince Vaughn, you'll LOL too. His scenes with Isla Fisher (a cute fling who becomes a comedic psycho) pile up and the story requirements rob us of seeing Vaughn do more zany things with buddy Wilson. The early scenes are great---with their clever scheme to bust in on weddings and score with lonely women at the reception---and I wanted more of that selfish hedonism. The two man-children are at their best when they're putting people on. The climax requires sincerity and it's handled nicely enough. Give me more of the ""I wish I had the guts to pull that stuff"" screwiness, though.Wilson's scenes with young stunner Rachel McAdams carry the plot. He falls for her at her sister's wedding and gets himself & Vaughn invited to the family home for the rest of the weekend. They're cute together, but Vaughn is the charming rogue of this picture, humorously fending off advances from more than 1 member of McAdams' screwy family. Not even daddy Walken can maintain control of his kids. There should have been more wedding crashing in 'Wedding Crashers', although the movie certainly doesn't need to be any longer than it already is. The movie is flawed, but Vinny V in particular is a ton of fun.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Lock it up!,"When push comes to shove it's probably my favorite movie of all- time. I've seen it around 50ish times and it never loses its luster for me. It's always hilarious, but I also think it's kind of underrated in terms of its dramatic moments...which I think Dobkin and the cast absolutely nail.This movie also holds a special place in my heart because it's the movie that my wife (then ex-girlfriend) watched on the night we decided to get back together after almost a year apart. And it has become a tradition for the two of us to watch it every year on that exact day because it's such a special memory that we like to re- live.I've also seen it a number of times with an old friend of mine and we would always recite the lines along with the movie and even talked all the time about crashing a few weddings of our own together. There was even a time where we got into a situation in real life where we were able to recreate a scene from the movie... It was totally unplanned, but the situation presented itself perfectly so we just ran with it. That was a lot of fun. Sadly though that friend and I don't really keep in touch anymore, but it's still great to look back on those times and remember how much fun we had and how the power of one movie could bring two people such happiness...if only for a little while.I'll love this movie forever because of that and now I can't wait for my next re-watch. And on that note I'll leave everyone with this:Rule #1: Never leave a fellow Crasher behind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A difficult movie to rate,"I love the premise of Wedding Crashers but I've never been able to watch it to the end. Two friends Jeremy and John (Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson) spend their summers breaking into strangers' wedding ceremonies and parties to have a free good time, eat, drink and meet women. You'd better believe there are people in the real world who do this! But I think this movie veers too heavily in the 'gross out' direction, when it could have been a little less zany and more of a narrative. The men, as usual, are the stars and drivers of the narrative, and the women are more side-players. Which is a pity, because Rachel McAdams, as Claire, the bridesmaid that John falls for, is very intelligent and could have played a bigger role. On the other hand, I tired of Isla Fisher as Gloria, the kooky sister of Claire, who starts to stalk Jeremy after snaring his interest at her sister's wedding. Fisher goes way over the top in her obsessions, and it gets annoying. I really like Vince Vaughn and he has a ball with his 'strange guy serious about this bizarre lifestyle' schtick. I also like Owen Wilson, who always plays Owen Wilson, the happy-go-lucky slacker who is up for anything. It's a little disturbing to see how the friends lie to, charm and then bed so many nice women, then discard them - it gets a bit creepy, to be honest, and maybe wouldn't be portrayed the same these days. I'm grateful to the editors for casting Christopher Walken as the super preppy politician father of the bride - he's just a gem and loves playing this part. I also love the montage of all the different weddings that Jeremy and John attend - Jewish, Italian, Chinese, Irish and Hindu. It shows that they all have things in common - great food, nice clothes, music and big groups of people out to have a really good time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The funniest film of the year!,"THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!There was a period during the late 80's to early 90's when there was a very tangible dry spell for horror films. Then Scream exploded onto the scene and horror films have enjoyed a very healthy recrudescence for the last ten years. I feel the same can be said for comedies. While there certainly have been some very funny ones in the last ten years ( Something About Mary, American Pie, Zoolander ) for the most part, everything feels like it is has been recycled ad nausea. But then you get something refreshing and original like The Wedding Crashers and it restores your faith in Hollywood.People say that there are eleven stories that Hollywood tells over and over again, in various forms of course with a few idiosyncrasies to give them an original feel. The Usual Suspects in the twelfth story and Wedding Crashers is the thirteenth. This is a romantic comedy for sure and it is rather silly in some areas, but if you want to just laugh out loud and have a lot of fun, then this is about as sure fire a hit that Hollywood has produced in quite sometime.What makes the film so enjoyable is the writing of course, but to pull it off, you need the right cast. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson and a surprisingly complete performance by Rachael McAdams make this film a treat and a hoot to experience.I have to admit that part of my zeal for the film has to do with the fact that Vince Vaughn's character, Jeremy Grey, is an extension of his character Trent Walker from Swingers. Vaughn made a name for himself in the indie hit of 1996 as the motor mouthed, quick thinking, loyal best friend of Mike Peters. His performance as the eccentric playboy is what put him on the Hollywood radar and it was his performance in Swingers that got him a role in Jurassic Park II. Jeremy is Trent all grows up. It's what he would have become. I'm sure this was by design and it works to perfection. This is Vaughn's movie. Owen Wilson is very nice as well and he gets top billing and the bigger paycheck, but make no mistake about it, this is Vaughn's vehicle start to finish.As funny as the film is and as sublime a performance as Vaughn gives, the other part of the film that works to perfection is the romance between Wilson and McAdams. There is a sweetness to it and that works because McAdams is so fresh and exciting to watch on screen. She has a definitive presence and when she is on screen you care about her. She was like that in The Notebook and also in Red Eye. She is one of the bright new stars of Hollywood and I look forward to anything else she does.Wedding Crashers is about as laugh out loud funny as you are going to get and even though it might go on for about 10 minutes too long, those 10 minutes have the cameo that we were all waiting for and that justifies the length.In the last few years, films like Zoolander, Meet The Parents, Old School, Anchorman, Starsky and Hutch and Dodgeball have pretty much been the funniest films of their respective years. Wedding Crashers adds to the Frat Pack's legacy and doe not disappoint.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Crashing a comedy genre.,"Warning: Vaughn talks fast in this movie. Other warnings I should mention about: the movie isn't that funny until we see Gloria and Claire. The jokes are few and far between. The Rules of Wedding Crashing that you see in the Trivia page for this movie are irrelevant. The story, mind you, holds up and for 2005, it does stand unchallenged for the adult comedy of that year.Two divorce mediators have an interesting hobby. They crash weddings to bed the bridesmaids. Inevitably, one falls in love for his prey.What kind of a name is Sack anyway? You will laugh at least one point in the movie. Currently, I believe it's Vince Vaughn's best work to date. Rachel McAdams is continually proving herself to be Hollywood's 'It' Girl with another great performance in yet another movie she doesn't have to try so hard in.

funny but not too funny,"This is my review on wedding crashers now don't get me wrong this movie definitely has its moments but its not really a laugh out loud comedy. It is more of a romantic smart comedy.

They do quite well until they attend one wedding inpaticular. Wilson sees a girl and instantly falls in love with her. Then the movie goes on from there with him trying to win his love.One thing I didn't like about this movie was this. OK so they go to weddings planning on sleeping with girls but oh wait owen sees a girl he instantly falls in love with (sort of stupid and cliché in my book) also after the first half of the movie the comedy dies its all romance.If you are into romantic comedies this one is definitely for you.

Sweet and Vulgar,"""Wedding Crashers"" is the quintessential 21st century comedy. It acts like it is really raunchy but in the end it is as sweet as a 1930's Ginger Rogers romantic comedy.It is much better than I would have thought from seeing the advertisements. In most comedies these days, the ads give away the best jokes. This one saves them for the film.I'm not much of a fan of Vince Vaughn or Owen Wilson but the supporting cast saves the film. Rachael McAdams steals every scene she is in and is worth the price of admission. Christopher Walken plays a role reminiscent of Meet the Parents. Artie Johnson looks the same as he did 25 years ago in Laugh-in.I also appreciated that the film did not rely on doing the same jokes over and over. It appears they actually put some thought in the script, a rarity these days.If you liked ""Meet the Fockers"" and ""Dodgeball,"" you will probably like ""Wedding Crashers.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Good comedy in its genre,"Wedding Crashers is, to be truthful, rather typical kind of comedy for its stars: it deals in sex jokes, situation comedy and overall idiocy. And that isn't a bad thing.As it is typical for this genre, the beginning and the middle part are the funniest in this film. There are some milder, dramatic scenes, which of course are necessary from the plot point of view, but are in all rather standard love drama.Cast does a good job in the film. Owen Wilson (John Beckwith) and Vince Vaughn (Jeremy Grey) are funny as two juvenile friends, whose aim in life is to crash weddings in the hopes of getting laid. And they are very successful in that. But then comes the ""different"" wedding, where John falls head over heels for Claire (Rachel McAdams), the daughter of U.S. Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken).'Wedding Crashers' is funnier than most of the comedies of its genre.

A Surpprisingly Smart and Entertaining Romantic Comedy,"WEDDING CRASHERS is a smart yet raucously funny romantic comedy that has a little more substance to it than the trailers might imply. The movie looks like a pure slapstick comedy on the surface but ends up evolving into much more. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn play John Beckwith and Jeremy Gray, respectively, two DC attorneys who meet women in their spare time by crashing weddings. Why two Washington lawyers would have so much trouble meeting women that they have to crash weddings is beyond me, but I digress. John and Jeremy definitely find more than they bargained for when they crash a wedding for the daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury (Christopher Walken) and get involved with the Secretary's two younger daughters. The movie is a little long, but consistently entertaining, anchored by a solid screenplay and razor-sharp performances from Wilson and Vaughn. Wilson, is a standout in particular, with a charismatic performance that could elevate him from the Stiller-Vaughn rep company to his own position as a romantic leading man. Wilson lights up the screen here and has never been more appealing on screen. Rachel McAdams is lovely as his leading lady and Walken gives one of his most beautifully underplayed performances as the Secretary. Former Bond Girl Jane Seymour is lovely as Walken's wife and looks incredible and there's a hysterical cameo by comic genius Will Ferrell that's just icing on the cake. Though the screenplay could have used a little tightening, WEDDING CRASHERS is still an entertaining trip providing solid laughs most of the way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
10/10,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I expected it to be a predictable, typical rom-com following the same tropes and beats and in some ways it was but there was something so tender about it that couldn't categorize it into those endlessly factory-made films with no heart. I may be exaggerating but I liked the film more than I thought I'd do. And it's particularly because of the amazing cast. It has Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Bradley Cooper and Christopher Walken, among others. What more do you need. Walken and Vaughn were very good here. Funny and a pleasure to watch while Owen Wilson did a pretty good job holding everything together. Rachel McAdams is great in this. And this maybe because I just love her. She is charming, cute, gracious and gorgeous. And all of this is enough for me to fall in love with her as Wilson did. Some of the jokes don't fit in quite well, some land well but largely it's an enjoyable affair. And don't let anybody tell you any different. Yes, it's cliché but only because it's supposed to be. It has to be. Don't let anybody fool you because that is what you want to see. A light and fun romantic comedy which is perhaps predictable but, you know, it's part of the deal, it's what you sign up for and yes there are instances of films where no compromise is needed to be made but those are very rare. And this is anything but rare. But it's good enough to sit back and have a laugh about it and be a hopeless romantic, once again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Great comedy ... but the drama part of it ...,"... is not good, to be quite honest. It's always the hardest thing, in a romantic comedy, to work out the serious/drama part and make it believable in the whole context of the movie. And I for once, look for standards, that unfortunately most movies fail to hit or to come by, as is this one.The comedy part is great (I've only seen the theatrical cut), Owen and Vince work great together. The beginning of the movie is fast and has some hilarious moments ... it even works out up to the point of the one wedding, that is going to be very crucial for both of them. After that there are of course not many big surprises coming up (you'll know where it all leads eventually), so it's a shame the second part is overshadowed with so much drama ... drama and problems, that don't seem real (in the context of the movie and the relationships of the characters that is).If you're not thinking too much as I did, you might enjoy this movie more than I did, but I just saw too much missed opportunities in this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Weddings, Parties, Anything","Two friends who have turned crashing weddings (to score free food, free booze and loose women) into an art form find their values challenged when invited to spend the weekend with a politician and his unmarried daughters in this jovial comedy starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. The two stars have excellent chemistry together and the film gets off to a great start with many funny moments to be had as they crash an extensive variety of weddings while reciting a charter of over one hundred rules to one another, such as ""Rule #16: Always have an up-to-date family tree"" when almost caught out. The fun slows down though when they begin to spend the weekend with the politician. Christopher Walken is solid as always as the community pillar of a man and his family are a nicely eccentric bunch, with Jane Seymour well cast as his cougar wife and Keir O'Donnell delightful as his closeted gay son obsessed with painting. The film tries too hard to have a heart in this section though and subsequently slides into formulaic territory quickly with Wilson winning a girl, losing her through betrayal and then having to win her back. The movie also rather oddly spends more time on Wilson and Vaughn talking about growing up and leaving their wedding crashing days behind than their actual crashing of weddings. It is all a tad too sweet if surely passable as light entertainment.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Trite yet still amusing comedy,"The Wedding Crashers is a film that advertises two childish bozos crashing weddings and bagging hotties. It looks like a lot of fun. It's a shame it never quite lived up to that hype.For 25 minutes the Wedding Crashers is just that. Two guys crashing weddings with preposterous, yet altogether amusing back stories about who they are, and why they are there. Fine. Then at one wedding John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) meets a girl named Claire. And after he meets her boyfriend, he knows that he must somehow woo her out of his arms, much to the chagrin of Jeremy (Vince Vaughn).The characters grow consciences. Consciences? Why? I have no problem with sentiment in film. I loved Jerry Maguire and When Harry Met Sally. But if in American Pie Stifler turned around and said ""Actually this bozo clowning isn't for me, I'm going to get married and settle down instead"" you would be scoffing at the screen.The rest of the film then plays out somewhat loosely like Meet The Parents, in which both men try to impress their ladies' father. Que stock characters galore; we meet the nasty boyfriend, the Grandma who says whatever's on her mind, the good hearted waiter and the gay son. And there are some hit and miss jokes along the way too (The funniest being at the dinner table).Did I laugh? Yes. Was I glad I saw it? Well, yes. So no it's not a bad film. But I can't help but feel that I didn't watch the Wedding Crashers. I watched a much more schmaltzy and diluted film (the ending would make Frank Capra roll his eyes). But it IS funny. So I'm giving this one a marginal thumbs up, on the strength of it's jokes. Just a shame about the rest though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Finally a solid comedy,"The 2000's thus far have been devoid of actual comic genius that deviated from the gag and gross-out joke. Wedding Crashers actually brings with it some interesting situational humor and witty rhetoric. It is a solid comedy and definitely worth a watch. Vaughn and Owen have a pretty well maintained chemistry throughout, with Vaughn's performance stealing the comedic edge by far and Owen performing well in the facets of both comedy and warming the heart. I personally could have done without the brother character, as that seemed to be the only superfluous storyline that didn't really fit well into the film. There's nothing completely unpredictable about the film, unless perhaps you count the one very good cameo performance, but predictability aside, it is thoroughly enjoyable and highly entertaining, and most definitely a step above the ""Dude Where's my Car""-esquire tripe that has been hitting the theaters lately.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Boring...,"This movie was so boring! I became angry during the first ten minutes because of the dull dialogue. I almost left the theatre but, decided to stick it out. And that's why I didn't give this film any less than a 7, because the middle of the movie was non-stop laughs. The end was just as lame as the beginning but, if you can bare all the bull just long enough to get to the good stuff then Wedding Crashers is worth seeing at least once. The two leading actors are personal favorites of mine and they manage to make even the stupidest jokes funny most of the time. Honestly, I wish I hadn't paid $9.25 to see it.

Vaughn & Wilson make a fine comic duo; Fisher steals the uproarious comedy,"WEDDING CRASHERS (2005) *** Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Isla Fisher, Christopher Walken, Jane Seymour, Bradley Cooper (Cameo: Will Farrell) Frequently uproarious high-concept comedy  two best buddy divorce consultants (Vaughn and Wilson making a dynamite comic duo) sneak into weddings to hook up with bodacious babes until one fine event where Wilson falls for the beautiful McAdams, the daughter of the US Secretary of the Treasury (the wily and weird Walken) which proves for a problematic and unforgettable weekend of wills. Vaughn with his rapid fire amalgam persona of Tom Hanks/Bruce Willis/Bill Murray/Michael Keaton is hysterical with his touchy-feely aggressive womanizer and instigator to Wilson's trademark cool breeze low-key softer 'dude with 'tude' compliment one another through most of the film until the weak final act that feels like a mitigated tack on by scribes Steve Faber & Bob Fisher despite some welcome R-rated sexual hi-jinks and crude humor with a solid hold by director David Dobkin letting his pair of jokers on a free reign of debauchery cum aging frat boy histrionics. Relative newcomer Fisher steals the film as McAdams' younger deceptive sister whose pristine demeanor shields an inner-wild child. Fast and funny.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"The cast is great, the movie good","Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn sure know how to have fun. They seem to bounce off of each other with ease and pleasure, milking each scene for all it's worth. That pleasure is contagious in this movie, a buddy comedy that turns into a romantic comedy with a little bit of drama mixed in and a pinch of Will Ferrell to spice things up in the last act- all of which blends together quite nicely, which really is no surprise at all considering the talent involved.Vaughn and Wilson are marriage counselors (how these characters ever got into this field of work is beyond me- beyond them too, probably) who spend a few months each year crashing weddings (i.e. attending weddings without invitation and singling out a young woman, one for each man, for a night of ""fun""; after all, women are more prone to give in to a charming man in light of the passions brought about by weddings, and the two men don't see any harm in taking advantage of this). Their characters, Jeremy Grey and John Beckwith respectively, are so serious about wedding crashing that they have a whole list of rules and a specific season in which they can crash. Unfortunately for the two of them, at a wedding late in the season, both of them end up involved with girls they can't seem to get away from.And this is where the romantic comedy comes into play. Until this point, all the funny came from the banter back and forth between Wilson and Vaughn (who, by the way, should form their own improv duo), but Isla Fisher steals every scene she's in as a sex-obsessed daughter of a government official (Christopher Walken) who has her heart (and body) set on Jeremy. This is a case where going over the top was exactly what was needed, and Isla Fisher delivers with gusto. Rachel McAdams has a plainer and less flashy role as Fisher's sister and, coincidentally, the woman that steals Owen Wilson's heart right out from under him, but she, as usual, is still quite good. Will Ferrell makes a cameo appearance near the end as the man that invented wedding crashing, and his performance deserves to be seen for how terribly wrong it is and yet how funny it still manages to be.The cast is better than the movie though, which is not an entirely bad thing. Instead of weighing us down with a deep message about the power of love and love conquering all, Wedding Crashers lets its actors run wild. Though it's not without its morals- it celebrates having fun and political incorrectness, but it also has an understanding of a person's limits and responsibilities to himself and those he cares about. But really, a movie like this is just a playground for the talent involved. And boy is it fun to watch them play.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The acting is good, there're some really nice names (I especially appreciated Isla Fisher's role, as Gloria Clearly, she was great), that's no the point; the real problem, in my perspective, is when the movie tries to be ""serious"". Why to transform what is supposed to be a crazy comedy into a romance comedy, with always the same plot lines: so typical, repetitive and boring?!

Thank God this was R-Rated.,"Not a great film, it works because of the unusual situation(s) the leads find themselves in, and also the R-rated parts added back in, which are welcome. Hopefully this will remind Hollywood that there will always be an audience for R-rated material; naked women never go out of style.The characterization is barely there-- Vince Vaughn steals the movie just by showing up, and Owen Wilson is fleshed out more by Vince's actions and lines than anything Wilson brings to the proceedings. Some other fun characters show up, but aren't fleshed out at all, even Vince's psycho-stalker gets one good character line at the end, when there was so much more to be said. The movie is paced and directed amateurishly, which is no huge surprise if you look at director David Dobkin's filmography.If I wrote the movie, that would frustrate me to no end, but I only had to sit through it once, and it was adequate. Hopefully it's the re-emerging of its genre, but even if it's not, it was an okay time. Watch for an unbilled cameo, as well as Christopher Walken for no apparent reason. It's a movie-reviewer cliché to use the word ""radiant,"" but Rachel McAdams was radiant. And Jane Seymour is still hot. Nice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Humorous vows?,"Good concepts to certain films can go a long way and I think in the case of THE WEDDING CRASHERS, the concept itself sold the movie, at least to me. Sure, having Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson starring in it helps, but the concept alone seems like something original and funny, at least on the surface. But, comedies don't really need a thriving story line, just one that makes some sense, allowing openings for actors like Wilson and Vaughn to make people laugh. But, make no mistake about it, this duo of Wilson and Vaughn by no means compares to the classic THE BLUES BROTHERS pair of John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, like some critics have voiced. As funny as these two guys are, comparing them to jokesters like Belushi and Aykroyd is jumping the gun a bit. Maybe after we see them in a more driven comedy, we can make comparisons, but for now they're just two funny guys with great chemistry that hopefully will make more movies together. And if those future movies are anything like THE WEDDING CRASHERS, we're all in for quite a treat, I think.What happens when you get two divorce mediators/attorneys together at a wedding they were not invited to? Well, they crash it of course and that's exactly the premise behind this story of Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) and John Beckwith (Owen Wilson), who crash weddings in their spare time to pick up women. Sure, crashing weddings to pick up women is low and borderline sleezy, but it's funny and that's really all that matters. But, all the fun and games seem to end when the duo crash the wedding of Treasury Secretary William Cleary's (Christopher Walken) daughter and wind up falling for two bridesmaids Claire (Rachel McAdams) and Gloria (Isla Fisher), who were also sisters to the bride and daughters to the Secretary. But, falling in love is not part of the ""wedding crashing"" rules, so when John started to bend the rules a bit, Jeremy quickly got on his case, but the deed was done. John had already fallen for Claire and while he tried to figure out how to get closer to her, Jeremy was realizing just how nutty Claire's sister Gloria was, making up many of the stories hilarious parts. Between the two separate stories going on, you never had a chance to stop laughing, as John was able to be just as much the butt of a joke as Jeremy was, making up one heck of an ending that although predictable, was funny nonetheless.You can't really get too deep into this film without giving credit to the cast, led of course by Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. The two make up quite a duo, combining two different styles of comedy, which is never a bad thing. Wilson's slow, methodical ways of being funny matched Vaughn's speedy delivery of jokes was truly something to watch. They definitely complimented each other, allowing each other to show off their talents and still be funny together when the time came. And to me, Vaughn made the film what it was with his nonchalant facial expressions, adding to his crazy stories or acts. But, Wilson is no slouch either, as he seems to keep churning out one funny movie after another, the last one being STARSKY AND HUTCH with fellow jokster Ben Stiller. Having said that, the pair had quite a supporting cast led by Christopher Walken, who on the surface might not seem funny, but can spit out some funny lines if you watch him. But, then there was Rachel McAdams (THE NOTEBOOK), who's character seemed to always bring the rest of the group back down to earth, which was great considering her on-screen sister Isla Fisher (I HEART HUCKABEES) was busy making Vince Vaughn look like a fool. There's even a cameo appearance that will sure draw some laughs worthy of $20 million dollars. But, overall this cast worked well together complimenting Wilson and Vaughn each step of the way.THE WEDDING CRASHERS might not be up everyone's ally when it comes to comedies, but for those of us that enjoy watching actors make fools of themselves at the expense of good humor, this one is a keeper. With Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn leading a thriving cast of diverse talents, I can't imagine this film being any better. Sure there were a few parts that were a bit over the top and borderline sick, but that's the beauty of an R-rated comedy and one I would dub the best of the year thus far. So, even though this film might go too far for kids under 18 to watch, for those adults who still have a kid inside them, this one is for you.B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

LOL Funny,"We had a free screening of Wedding Crashers at the Air Force base theater yesterday.L O L funny. Maybe the crowd we saw it with helped make it even funnier, but many times ...many... the crowd was laughing loudly, and even clapping in parts.There was about ~20 minutes in the middle of the film that was kinda sluggish because Owen Wilson's character was going through heartache. That's yawn and bathroom break time. The film has quite the formulaic ending, but other than that, the film's pretty darn good.It's rated R for boobies and language. It's almost like they put those in to bring in the HS boy crowd, because they could've easily edited them out and the movie wouldn't have changed at all. You'll be seeing the edited version on network television for sure.The main female stars are Rachel McAdams (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1046097/) and Isla Fisher (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0279545/) as Gloria. ""Gloria"" steals much of the movie, but that's a very good thing because she's the reason for many of the LOL moments (plus she's curvaceously cute). So even though Rachel's and Owen's characters are supposedly the main focus of the movie, it's Isla and Vince that follow a close 2nd.Instant classic? I don't think so; it's not filled with enough quotable one-liners.Will Ferrell (wedding crasher master) and Christopher Walken (the father) have supporting partsA definite rental, an easy matinée, an extremely good candidate for full price, and I wouldn't say that about very many (movie) comedies that have ever been made (I really like Airplane and The Jerk, FYI)",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The plot was very strong and brilliant.The problem is I found Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn's acting very dry, and not funny at all, though I'd say Owen Wilson was the better of the two. Who stood out for me the most was the excellent acting of Rachel McAdams and Isla Fisher, who are both excellent actresses in their own right, and this movie only further proved that point.

Will Ferrell almost ruins this movie,"In my opinion Wedding Crashers is about 90 percent a good fairly enjoyable comedy. And about ten percent a God awful one. The 90 percent because Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are two wonderfully charming comedic actors, while their performances aren't anything exceptional they're still pretty funny and likable. I especially thought Vince Vaughn's scenes with Isla Fisher were hilarious, including the infamous scene when she ties her too his bed while hes asleep. Christopher Walken is also there, where he is once again playing Christopher Walken, but that's OK because I like Christopher Walken up to a certain point anyway and hes just as quirky and funny as ever. But the ten percent of Wedding Crashers which stops it from being a fully enjoyable comedy, is the pointless ""cameo"" of Will Unfunny Cunting Ferrell towards the end. What the hell was he even doing in this movie? His part was pretty superfluous and I can almost picture the director waiting off screen waving his pay cheque.

"Lightweight entertainment, good for a laugh","Wedding Crashers was touted to be one of the surprise hits of the year - and while it is good and definitely has its moments; there's just too much wrong with it to be a complete success. The first, and biggest problem is that it's just too long; while the plot is at it's best, you just want the film to continue; but after the pivotal middle section has expired, the film doesn't leave much to keep the audience interested. To be honest, I was bored with the last twenty minutes. The plot focuses on a really good idea - namely, turning up to weddings, pretending to be some distant relation, and then using this position to meet women who are basking in the glow of 'true love'. I'd engage in this activity myself if English weddings weren't so rubbish. Anyway, the plot follows two divorce mediators that make a habit of crashing weddings. Wedding season is nearing it's close, but there's still one big one left; namely, the wedding of the Treasury Secretary's daughter. After successfully infiltrating the event; one of the team finds himself at odds when he falls in love with the bride's sister...A lot of the movie relies on the two leads. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn team up for this movie, and they do a very good job of keeping the audience's interest. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of either of these two (or the rest of the 'Frat-pack', Jack Black aside) but they know how to make a movie like this work, and providing they keep delivering lightweight comedies; I'm sure they'll continue to please those who do like them. Christopher Walken appears in a support role, which is always nice to see; even if he does just rely on his persona these days, and Rachel McAdams (Red Eye, Mean Girls) takes the lead female role. The jokes, as you might expect, come thick and fast; with about half of them being funny, and a select few being very funny. Most of the comedy straddles that awkward line where characters find themselves in a situation they don't like; so if you like that humour, you'll probably like this. I cant say if this is better than other recent 'Frat-Pack' films like Dodgeball and Starsky and Hutch, having not seen them - but I will say that if all you want is an easy couple of hours of entertainment, this should suffice...despite being a bit too long.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I can't wait for the uncensored DVD cuz it's frikkin' rated R in the states.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
So good and then soooo bad...,"This movie has (almost) everything. A unique idea, well written for the most part, excellent acting on behalf of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughan. Funny funny funny and then in the last quarter - absolutely no conclusion, no climax, no wit. The scene in the church is ridiculous and let the actors dangle in a soupy mixture of cheese and those really bad Goldie-Hawn-Style cheapos. The grim, ever so well introduced and portrayed character Secretary Cleary played by Walken suddenly looses ground and the plot falls apart. Execution here fails even the most subtle expectation. Was there no more money for a better written ending or no more time to edit two or three more scenes with a more appropriate finish? In any case, I give it a 10 for potential, but only a 5 for a very disappointing lack of confidence toward the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Feel Great Movie!,"If you leave this movie and you are not in a good mood, get a copy of ""Don't Jump"" before you head home! It is the funniest thing I have seen since Animal House! The acting is superb on all accounts. Vaughn take this one and makes it his own. Wilson, adds to the mix and sets Vaughn up for the funniest lines in cinema in a long time! The supporting cast does their jobs very well.Who knew Jane Seymour had it in her? Isla Fischer and Rachel McAdams are the perfect fits as the corresponding muse for Vaughn and Wilson. Surprising twists keep this 2 hour comedy rolling right along, no lag time here! Definitely worthy of the R rating. But it is about time there was a true adult themed movie released...something 30 somethings can relate to and 20 somethings can aspire to! 40 somethings have been there done that, and anyone older that only wished they had thought to do it! Wedding Crashers is a classic! I will see it again and again, and buy the DVD!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Some Parts Original; Often Very Funny,"Parts of this movie are just great; other parts seem repetitive of lots of movies of this type. Many parts are laugh out loud and laugh hard. Other parts drag.The chemistry between Wilson and Vaughn is excellent, perhaps even better than that of Ben Stiller and Wilson, which is going some. Wilson's character seems the more typical, with Vaughn having more original bits to his character. As others have said, Vaughn's performance is not to be missed. The constant analysis of situations with reference to the ""rules"" is funny in part because of the truth contained in them and the perceptiveness of the characters, even though their goals are superficial.The supporting cast is great. It has been said before, but ""when Christopher Walken is the most sane character . . . ."" The younger sister and the brother are scene stealers. The interplay between the younger brother and the Vaughn is original and sidesplitting.Overall lots of fun. Worth the price of admission. Vince Vaughn deserved lots of attention before, for comedy and drama. This movie will establish him as a comedic star to look forward to.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The best bits are in the trailer,"You know how they sometimes say a trailer doesn't do a film justice? Well, for Wedding Crashers, the opposite applies. The truly funniest parts are to be found in the teasersnot the movie.Looking at the trailer, attempts were clearly made to advertise this as a raunchy sex-comedy. I am sad to say that it is not one, which is really quite a shame, since had it been, Wedding Crashers would have had at least something memorable to fall back on. Now it simply ends up being bland. The jokes are mostly unoriginal and unable to be saved by funnyman Vince Vaughn.Now, the movie is not bad exactly, but it is beyond me how it managed to get so many MTV Movie Awards and gross so much money at the box office. Why do people like this so much? Why is Christopher Walken in such a mediocre and unfunny comedy? When will Rachel McAdams stop playing miss goody-two-shoes in the most predictable way? I have so many questions.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Crash Into Me.........and Me........and Me...........and Me.........and Me.........,"Uproariously hilarious and dominant over-achiever that is going to stand tall with the better films of 2005. Two divorce attorneys (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn) take advantage of the summer season by literally going to weddings and posing as friends and/or relatives of total strangers to get access to red hot young women who have love on their minds. When they go to a wedding for the daughter of a popular politician (Christopher Walken), the Beavis & Butt-Head duo use their usual assets and antics to gain access to the high-class Maryland family's home. Wilson falls hard for one of Walken's daughters (Rachel McAdams of ""The Notebook"" fame who is engaged to super jerk Bradley Cooper) while Vaughn unwittingly becomes the one true love of Walken's youngest girl (a show-stopping, out of this world role for Isla Fisher). Wilson, falling in love for the first time in his life, does his best to stay as long as he can while Vaughn does everything in his power to get away from the demented Fisher. Wonderful turns abound by cameo actors and supporting performers (led by Jane Seymour, Henry Gibson, Keir O'Donnell and Ellen Albertini Dow) are right on target as the film uses strong momentum early and then when the story almost falls to plot resolutions late, a crazed twist keeps the entire project on its fast track. So many great moments (and super lovely ladies) make ""Wedding Crashers"" one of the most memorable and remarkable comedies of the last few years. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A movie full of joy,"I had this movie in my mental watchlist for a while. I decided to give it a look and it was just what I expected, and that is, an entertaining movie from start to end, laughs, nothing groundbreaking, some clichés here and there, and a good heart. Wedding Crashers is the kind of movie you can watch several times without getting bored, as I said, it's nothing groundbreaking, you can tell how is gonna end half way trough, and you can see clichés from the typical romantic comedies, but it's executed very very well that you fall for it. There's a lot of laughs and ""heart moments"", Owen and Vince have an amazing chemistry, hope I see them in more movies together.

Wedding Crashers of Old,"Java Man Reviews ""Wedding Crashers""(2005, R). Directed by David Dobkin. Written by Steve Faber & Bob Fisher. Starring Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Rachel McAdams, Christopher Walken, Isla Fisher, Bradley Cooper & Jane Seymour. Running Time: 119 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW:John and Jeremy (Wilson and Vaughn) are Washington D.C. divorce counselors who spend their off-hours and vacation-breaks pursuing their real passion... wedding crashing. The rules of the game are simple: have a well-rehearsed explanation of how you are related to the bride or groom; be extra nice to the bridesmaids and other single women at the wedding; and never, NEVER fall in love with any of your conquests. Of course the One Big Rule of the movie comedy is to break such rules as soon as possible -- and sure enough, one of the guys falls in love. This happens when they crash the wedding of the daughter of Treasury Secretary Cleary (Walken), who has two other daughters (McAdams and Fisher) and a wayward wife (Seymour). Once our heroes enter the Kennedy-style Cleary compound, their cover stories begin to unravel and complications ensue.REVIEW: 2.5 Java Mugs out of 4It was 1962, and we had just finished stocking shelves on a Saturday night. ""C'mon, Terry, we're going to a wedding reception,"" said my coworker Ken Skelly. ""Whose?"" I asked. ""It doesn't matter,"" he answered. And off we went, two 18-year-old wedding crashing pioneers. I should have written a screenplay.But a screenplay is just the beginning. What brings it to life is the imagination of the director and the talents of the actors. The talented actors we have: Wilson, Vaughn and Walken could recite the wording of a ballot issue and it would be hilarious. But somehow the film doesn't gel under Dobkin's direction. Walken for example, who normally chews up any movie he's in, seems subdued. And though Wilson and Vaughn have some sparkling moments together, their performances could have been more spontaneous. Some promising characters are left undeveloped. For example, Wilson and Seymour have a scene that echoes the great Mrs. Robinson seduction in The Graduate, but after that her character goes nowhere.Though it could have been better, the film is still fun to watch. The production design is attractive as are McAdams and Fisher, who have the comic touch as the daughters. The editing, too, is well-executed, including a musical montage that takes us through a United Nations of ethnic weddings (Greek, Italian, Indian, Irish), and ends with some fancy moves on the dance floor that transition to fanciful moves in the bedroom.Back in 1962, our wedding-crashing montage usually ended with us getting thrown out. But I would like to think that my old pal Ken perfected the technique and is still out there somewhere, crashing weddings and breaking hearts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funny. That's all that matters.,"This movie takes us to the edge of what's tasteful. Then it pulls our underwear over our heads and spanks us mercilessly. If you can handle it, you'll have a great time.""Wedding Crashers"" is a movie about a pair of 40-something men who have all the morals and tact of a bunch of teenagers on spring break. They run around crashing weddings, helping themselves generously to the food, music, and oh yeah, the women. In order to do this, they pull every trick in the book, trample on the sanctity of marriage, religion, peoples' feelings, and they're particularly cruel to German pop rock singer Nena by singing their hilariously horrible version of ""99 Luftballoons"" (a scene that was cut from the movie but available on the DVD deleted scenes). In other words, this is a movie that could possibly offend many people, but I don't think it does.The reason why it doesn't offend us, despite its borderline sexist, iconoclastic and irreverent approach, is because Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are the most lovable dorks you can imagine. They're not foul-mouthed neanderthals trying to subjugate the entire female species; instead they're really sweet guys who are shown to be sensitive, humble and more-or-less intelligent. They just happen to be on a quest for some nookie.Isla Fisher gives a great supporting performance as a mentally unbalanced nympho... sort of the female counterpart to the guys. Rachel McAdams plays the straight role giving the film stability. And Christopher Walken is... well, he's Christopher Walken. Nuff said.Don't expect a morality play, because this ain't one (at least not in the conventional sense). Just expect a lot of corny gags which are brilliantly executed. It can get pretty racy at times, but nothing explicitly raunchy. I'd put it in the same class as ""Hot Tub Time Machine"", ""There's Something About Mary"" and the hilarious Australian comedy ""The Wannabees"" (for you fans of Isla Fisher). These are all funny movies that take us to the edge of tackiness and deliver some great laughs. You probably wouldn't want to watch them with your mom in the room, but they're well worth the price of admission.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Better than the Previews,"This movie was a lot better than what the previews made it to look. Which is rare and usually the other way around. Owen Wilson is good in his own right in this movie. And as usual he has a sidekick; and his sidekick, Vince Vaughn stole this movie if you asked me. Vince was hilarious in this flick. Rachel McAdams absolutely lit up the screen with her smile. If you thought she was hot in ""Mean Girls"", you haven't nothing yet. Wedding Crashers is an all around, exciting, laughs-keep-coming type of piece. Strongly recommended for people who aren't afraid of laughing at stuff that is actually humorous. Anyway, if you find yourself not liking this movie, just stick around because there's a nice surprise toward the close of the movie. You won't be disappointed. ****1/2 out of *****.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Deceptively unoriginal,"The originality of 'Wedding Crashers' is conveyed by its title: a pair of young men gatecrash weddings (always full of strangers, so two more can easily pass unnoticed) in order to seduce women. But behind this premise, there's a plot that is a conventional replicate of a thousand other romantic comedies: everyone is beautiful, the class divide falls between the wealthy and the super-rich, sex is great but love is better, homosexuality is innately funny, the hero falls for the prettiest girl (in this case, the lovely Rachel McAdams) who rejects him in favour of her own wretched boyfriend owing to a misunderstanding but forgives him when he proves how much he loves her... a story both utterly unoriginal, and utterly unreal as well. So how much you like this film will probably depend mainly on how much you like its odd couple pairing of Vince Vaughn and Owne Wilson, both cast very much to type. Personally, I found the vision of unreconstructed maleness they projected a bit tiresome, not because of the characters in themselves, but because of the way they represent some kind of approved vision of how men are meant to be. There isn't any real insight into the innate nature of either sex here, to be frank; there are some laughs, but there are also times when you long for the film to go somewhere other than where you expect; and if that's how you feel, you'll still be longing when the credits roll by.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Go See It!,"Without giving anything away, I will say that this is one of the year's best movies, and I would not be surprised to see it on a ""10 Best List"" for the year. It is very well-acted, and the script is great. Both male leads are very appealing in very different ways. Vince Vaughn is very smart and quick witted. On the surface he seems uncaring, but actually turns out to be a great friend to Owen Wilson's character who also initially seems smart and self-absorbed, but is actually very sweet and vulnerable. Their different personalities compliments each other. This movie works because the story turns and twists in all kinds of different ways. Also, just when you think you have it all figured and you think you've seen this all before...you don't! And yes this is definitely a comedy, but there are dramatic elements to it as well running thru, and it works. There are some good performances, some great performances, and a few interesting performances. You will not be disappointed.

"funny, but unbelievable love story","This movie had more of a plot than I thought it would have. I was expecting a lot of raunchy humor like American Pie, but the jokes just weren't gross out ones. Two 30 year old guys get their kicks by crashing weddings during the summer. They do it for the food, boos, fun , and women. In the beginning, we see Jeremy and John attend a few weddings and see the tricks they pull to pick up women. Jeremy makes animal balloons and tells sob stories. Tehy try to cut the wedding cake and look like they belong before chatting up chicks.Then they crash the wedding of a congressman's daughter. Jeremy nails one of the brides maids, another daughter, Gloria. She's all clingy and it freaks him out. John likes another daughter, Claire, but she has a boyfriend. Gloria invites Jeremy and John to the family retreat. Jeremy doesn't want to go because he's ready to ditch Gloria, but John insists they must go so he can get Claire. All throughout the film they recite the ""rules"" and John points out Rule # says never leave a fellow crasher behind.The middle of the movie is at the retreat. A lot of laughs come from Claire's very competitive boyfriend and the family outcast, Todd. But the truth comes out about Jeremy and John lying. But things end up good for both guys in the end.But what really makes this movie unbelievable is that John, who loves one night stands, would fall in love with Claire in a day and want to stop being a hound dog. I don't think so. But just get by that part and the movie is good.Plus, Will Ferrell has a funny cameo as a legendary crasher.FIANL VERDICT: Funny, entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"really is ""The funniest film of the year so far""","This film has everything you want in a comedy. Mainly due to fine performances from Wilson, Vaughn and show-stealer Isla Fisher this pushes all the right buttons. A laugh out loud classic. The storyline does borrow heavily from the likes of meet the Fochers and American Wedding but is more consistently funnier than both. Vaughn is on top form and this could possibly be his best role in years and stands out even if he at times is playing second fiddle to Wilson. There is lots of good back up (perhaps a little short) from big guns like Walken, Seymour and a certain Frat pack member who all benefit from the script spreading humour across all characters. In conclusion this is a fun film in a year where only dark films seem to be any good. This film needs to be seen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
here comes the...something,"Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn have frequently co-starred in the past few years, and now they can add ""The Wedding Crashers"" to that list. They play John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey, who go to weddings so that they can have sex with the women there. But then everything gets out of hand when they follow one family home and John really starts getting attracted to the young woman.I don't know how they did it, but they did it. There are a few lapses, but most of the movie is a hoot. Sometimes, you think to yourself ""Did I just see that?"" Believe me, you did. I sure hope that these guys co-star in more movies in the future.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Good, funny, predictable.","Take the first American Pie and put it in a wedding setting right away - no high school. Your result would probably be The Wedding Crashers, only with more character dilemma in the beginning. While The Wedding Crashers is a decent movie, the truth is once you get so far you don't really need to see anymore. It's actually a rather long movie for a comedy. Owen Wilson plays.... Owen Wilson (the same role I've seen him in in every movie he stars in). Vincent Vaugh does a good job, I'm happy to see him rise as an actor even though he does seem to play the same part on occasion. The story is one you've seen before, Wilson meets a girl, wants her, finds out she's taken, and then fights for her heart. I've seen this formula before, so there really weren't any surprises after that. If you like this kind of formula in a movie then you'll find yourself completely entertained but if you're like me and you'd like to see some new twists then just remember you won't find them here. Although it's still entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great Summer Fun,"Great Fun! This movie started a little slow, but once the initial story line was open, the movie picked up steam and never slowed down.The movie kept got funnier each minute, had me gut busting laughter by mid-stream. The rating is ""R"" it is a good recommendation. Children, especially under 13 even with adult supervision is highly recommended due to language, and very sexually suggestive material and nudity which I might add, bring the movie its funniest moments.One of the best movies I have seen of the summer, real good fun, Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are great and work off each other very well. Vaughn has some great lines. I am certainly going to buy the DVD! The female stars, especially Rachel McAdams and Isla Fisher carry the other half and do an exceptional job - they are beautiful. Jane Seymour, always a knockout, is great in a comedy role outside of her normal acting role (drama).Christopher Walken plays a role within his normal roles, that of a slightly quirky individual.Will Farrell almost has a cameo, but why he was selected is anybody's guess since anyone could have carried the role with no problem. It may have taken away something from the movie, since Vaughn and Wilson do an outstanding job alone, Ferrell appears to be overkill in casting the role he played.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised and may even see it again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Would have been much better without Will,"I, and everyone in the theater, laughed a bunch through the first 3/4 of the movie, but when the Will Ferrell sequences came on the theater was silent. Overall it was a good movie. There were a few too many not so funny Vince rants and a couple slow spots beyond the Will sequences but there were a lot of great gags. There were several very subtle things that were done which really added to the humor.The last 15 or so minutes almost ruined the movie with the long and unfunny Will Ferrell sequences which felt like they ran for hours. Putting something that bad at the end of the movie is almost enough to make you forget about the good first 3/4 of the movie.Wedding Crashers without Ferrell rates 8.5 but with him it drops it to a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Two Hours of absolute laughter.... One of the best of the year,"We go to the movies for entertainment and enjoyment and a few laughs. This movie is one of the funniest we have ever seen.

Christopher Walkin is spectacular as is the very gorgeous Jane Seymour. Belly laughs and toilet humor are simply out of this world and the girls are all gorgeous.

GOD have abandoned us!!!!,"I can see no other reason why he let this curse released onto mankind.last night I borrowed the DVD from my brother. sharp minded as always my thoughts BEFORE the movie were :hmm this will probably a cliché romantic movie, bachelors having the fun of there lives, but suddenly they realize they feel empty inside ,fall in love and marry at the end of the movie. but what the hell, I thought.If it brings me a good laughter en good jokes I'll take the corny romantic unavoidable nonsense, you can't have it all in life,can you? and after all I was in a very good mood , I just wanted to see brainless good humor and shatter all my guts out.so during the movie I giggled here and there, one joke is better than the other, but thats normal, you can't expect that everything is funny or plausible.but then the horrifying over clichéd stinking predictable romantic bull crap began... much much much earlier than I could ever expected. I thought lets laugh for about 80 minutes and lets then take on the corny sh*t. but no. I was like:what the hell?? why aren't they crashing weddings anymore? the romantic starts just in the very beginning of the movie. for a while I could live with it but later on in the movie some of the cheesy dialogs make me sick in both in stomach and head.and yeah the story of course who could have predicted it??? the pretenders are getting caught, everybody is feeling miserable(romantic clishé number 1 is that first everything has to go wrong of course) the girl is intending to marry her boyfriend( who is by total coincidence a total jerk who gives nothing about here and the chick has of course first fall in love with another guy to realize that after a relationship of almost 4 years) , the friend first doesn't want anything to do with the chick who's totally over him, but guess what... yes also they fall in love en end up married. than we have the over clichéd ""I love you declaration"" in public( textbook romantic cliché number 2) and the film ends with not 1 but 2 happy couples ..Like I said , I expected some romantic nonsense, but I could never expect they would use ALL the over clichéd textbook romantic crap during the whole movie in a very cheesy way!!I was stunned , shocked ,awed and above all traumatically disappointed. I was out for a cheap laughter, but this story was so cheap it was an insult for my intellect. fine some jokes are OK, but the story is so bad I can't imagine you like this movie unless you're the typical ""I want a cheesy happy ending romantic movie girl""If you're not, save yourself some money ,TIME and a traumatic experience to not watch this movie",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Sacul goes crashing with Vince and Owen,"Two guys crashing weddings for the free booze, the free food, and easy women. A premise that'll make most men over the age of 35 wonder: ""Why the hell didn't I think of that?"" With a plot as thin as this it would be easy for this movie to fail and fall as flat as your drunken uncle Devin at the last family reunion. It doesn't. Despite the fact that this movie takes the typical roads and the characters learn life lessons and fall in love this movie has a ton of laughs.Watching these guys lie, cheat, and woo, it's easy to see just how much fun everyone had making this movie. Owen and Vince bounce improvised moments each other in a comedic symbiosis few can match. You can make a solid bet you'll see an unrated DVD later packed with hours of these two just firing off lines. Chris Walken feels a little under used in this movie, but it's hard to pay attention when his nymphomaniac daughter played by Isla Fischer is stealing nearly every scene she's in. Jane Seymour basically channels Mrs. Robinson for the few brief moments she registers in this movie but the scenes are funny and quick and seemed to have been part of some deleted sub plot that got dropped. Rachel McAdams part is pretty standard, she's the love interest but her character has the least going on. It's not that she's bad she just wasn't given much to do that would make her stand out in this family tree of nuts.This is the wingman/buddy picture this summer was sorely missing.

Right for all the wrong reasons,"I've been using this site for a while now and have never posted my own reviews.

I still don't see how any of these clowns will ever make anything better than Old School. However, the actual story in the movie was fun. An emotional comedy, with an actual plot and an effort to make the story as realistic as possible, obviously in the realm of a comedy. Great performances by Vaughn and McAdams. It's so hard not to like her after this movie, I'm hoping I'll meet her one day.The best idea the director had was making this movie 2 hours long, as to actually be able to insert a development towards the climax, as opposed to making a run of the mill slapstick comedy.

Definitely one of the most entertaining and funny movie i have seen this year.Synopsis: Two wedding crasher went to the stranger wedding to get lucky with the bride maid until everything went haywire when Jeremy sleep with a Treasury Secretary's virgin daughther and John falls hard on another daughter Claire.What surprise me is that Owen and Vince really did a great job lifting this movie and make a really brilliant buddy team. They are so funny together. This is one very delightful film with a brilliant story, awesome cast (Isla really look like goddess, and Rachel look great). Though the story is very much predictable, it won't stop you from enjoying this movie.Recommendation: Guarantee To Get A Big Laugh.Rating: 7.5/10 (Grade: B)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
:0,"While watching this movie it left me absolutely cackling at some of the jokes! This movie is so funny and Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Rachel Adams all did such amazing jobs acting in this. The only thing I personally didn't like while watching was that owen wilson's character seemed so selfish and didn't care about his friend throughout the entire movie, all he thought about were his decisions. Even in the end it kinda felt like he didn't learn to care about Vince's character, you think they would be better to each other if they were best friends. Sometimes that's just how it is though. Out of the whole movie that is my one complaint!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Hillariously Amazing.,"This movie was just awesome. I want to see it again and again. Maybe its because Owen Wilson is so gorgeous... or maybe because it was just that funny. This movie truly made me laugh, and i found the plot and the outcome to be witty and entertaining.Vince Vaughn was great, he has got to be one of the funniest men alive, and I'm glad he was in the spotlight of this film. Owen Wilson, perhaps I'm biased because I think he's a stud, but I think he was also awesome in this movie. Him and Vince had an undeniable chemistry. I seen some of their bloopers and stuff and the majority of the comedy in this film was just Vince and Owen joking around. The scripts were just guidelines, a lot of the funny one liners were made up as they went. Then there's Will Ferrel. His cameo was just hilarious.As I said, the plot was very entertaining. It is outrageously cheesy and unlikely yes, but yet, it is just so side-splittingly comical, you find yourself enjoying it. It has a number of twists and turns and you're left wondering what could possibly happen next.The movie has it all, romance for the ladies, nudity and raunchy jokes for the men. You could see it on a date, or just a night out with your friends. I don't know if I'd recommend going with your family though. All in all, I say the is a premium comedy that all should see. It is definitely worth the price of admission.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Crash This Wedding,"""The Wedding Crashers"" has all the elements of a ""Frat Pack"" comedy. It stars Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in the leads, and has a cameo by Will Ferrell near the end of this funny flick. There are plenty of ""gross out"" jokes that will leave you laughing, if you have this sense of humor. All that is missing is Ben Stiller.Vaughn and Wilson are John Beckwith and Jeremy Klein, two carefree Washington-based womanizing divorce mediators who meet and bed with young women at every ethnic wedding in town that they aren't invited to - Jewish, Italian, Irish, Indian, etc. Surprisingly, they are the most sought-after guests that women and children take to (in fact, one difficult boy stubbornly demands Jeremy to make a bike out of balloons). These guys lie and cheat their ways at weddings to get the girls they want.Then it's the big social event of the year. One of the daughters of Treasury Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken, once again in one of his ""eccentric"" roles every director demands him to play) and his slinky 50ish wife Kathleen (Jane Seymour, who displays middle-aged sexuality and keeps her modesty, in an implied nude scene with Owen Wilson later on) is getting married. They crash this wedding. Then they are invited by the sisters of the bride, Claire (Rachel McAdams) and Gloria (Isla Fisher) to their Cape Cod house for the weekend. Claire is engaged to hunk Sack, who has such a violent streak he knocks down Jeremy so hard when they play football. But John has a liking for Claire, and then gets her at the end of the movie. Gloria falls for Jeremy. The faithless Kathleen (""Call me Kat"") wants John to fondle her breasts. As Kathleen, it would appear that Jane Seymour told the director not to display her breasts, just the top part, and then when it came to the breasts, Owen Wilson would block them with his hands covering them completely. The younger actresses boldly get the full frontal nudity, as in the case of the more comfortable Isla Fisher tying up Vince Vaughn. Also, the Clearys have a brother named Todd (Keir O'Donnell), a gay young man who falls for Jeremy. Then, there is a foul-mouthed grandmother played by Ellen Albertini Dow, the elderly rapster from Adam Sandler's ""Wedding Singer"" and now in ""The Wedding Crasher,"" providing her comic relief. Ms. Dow is a spunky old lady who loves a riotous wedding.This is the laugh-riot of the summer. Will Ferrell gives his support as Chaz the funeral crasher who falls for young, crying babes and gets both mushy and horny wherever he goes. Henry Gibson has never lost his deadpan ""Laugh-In"" style as the reverend for the Clearys' weddings. Wilson, Vaughn, Walken, Seymour, et al, display their talents at what they do best - seductive, eccentric, and very funny in their comic roles. The film is very reminiscent of ""There's Something About Mary,"" which also came out on July 15th seven years before. Both movies have sex, foul language, and dirty jokes throughout. And ""The Wedding Crashers"" is the biggest and best film of the summer of 2005, where most of the other movies (the needless remakes, for instance) make up a movie junkyard this season, which explains the Hollywood slump.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Wedding Comedic Bliss!,"""Wedding Crashers"" has engaged many movie lovers throughout the nation. It's a box office hit that ceremoniously has made a comedic impact in a very ""marry marry"" way. Vince Vaughn & Owen Wilson star as Jeremy Klein & John Beckwith, two hardcore wedding crashers who strategically plan out their pseudo-guest conquests with artistry and appeal. What are the rewards? Complementary culinary arts tasting, complementary liquor arts tasting, and complimentary vagina arts tasting! I am going to kill my high school career counselor! Why didn't he invite wedding crashologists to the school's annual career day event? Anyway, Jeremy & John eventually do fall in love and not in lust with female wedding guests. John succumbs to Claire Cleary, the candy-coated politician daughter played by the uprising starlet Rachel Mcadams. Jeremy falls for Claire's sister Gloria; her magnetically robust demeanor was quite memorable. Isla Fisher's jocular performance as Gloria makes her the ""scene-stealing maid of comedic honor"" of ""Wedding Crashers"". Our ""Wedding Crasher"" stars were also not too shabby. Vince Vaughn's prototype garrulous, but never exhausting, acting was quite stupendous. You also got to owe it to Owen for his perspicacious solid work. This dynamic comedic acting duo should not be annulled. They have the chemistry potentiality to be the ""Martin & Lewis"" of our generation. The rest of the cast of ""Wedding Crashers"" was also worth inviting. Christopher Walken once again was ""walkin"" to the part of a controlling, but yet, caring father with exact precision. Jane Seymour was ""m.i.l.f.ing"" it through as the hot mother who craves for John. We also get to ""see more"" of Seymour in ""Wedding Crashers"". That in itself is worth crashing this movie! Also, there is a high profile comedic actor who makes an appearance during the final segments of the film. I ""Will"" not say too much, but let me just state that he proves once more that he has the ""Will to Power"" in comedies. I do ""vow"" my head to Director David Dobkin for elucidating our humdrum summer movie season with ""Wedding Crashers"". Make sure your next movie ""reception"" is ""Wedding Crashers"". ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funnier than expected,"I did not remember Wedding Crashers being this humorous. When I saw it more than a decade ago, I think I was just annoyed by the main characters and their childish behavior. However, watching it now I see how the movie constantly treats most of their behavior as immature and inappropriate. Eventually they are physically and emotionally beaten up for being crashers. In the final act, they even bring in Will Ferrell to show that this isn't a good way to live, just in case there was still any doubt. I found myself enjoying many of the scenes and even coming around to like Vince Vaughn after he gets beat up a few times. Most of the characters in this movie are exaggerated to some degree, but I think it works well for this type of comedy. But more than anything I enjoy the sweet romantic-comedy aspect of the film. The chemistry between Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams works.One of the things that does surprise me about Wedding Crashers is the choice to make it R-rated. I know that seems like a strange criticism, but this film is so clearly one they could have worked into a PG-13 with some simple editing. (You'd think the studio would want to because that would have increased the box office.) Other people probably don't care and enjoy a boobs montage and a barrage of F-bombs, but for me it makes Wedding Crashers something I won't rewatch or recommend as much. There's also a slight feel of homophobia in the way they handle the character of Todd that bothers me, and feels extremely dated even in 2005. When I put that stuff aside, I am willing to swallow my pride and admit that I was wrong in my original assessment of Wedding Crashers. This is a movie that is entertaining and I'm glad I gave it a second chance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Are you serious?,"I saw this movie and everyone in the audience was cracking up at the most stupidest things. I sat there thinking to myself ""What's wrong with these people?

I just sat there and kept looking at my watch wondering when this crappy movie was going to be over with. Movies like this cause the box office slumps.

Strong Start....mediocre finish,"I too heard all of the hype surrounding this movie. Everyone around me seemed to be quoting this movie, and it was on my Netflix queue so I waited. I saw it tonight and I liked it....but.This was a great comedy. Wilson and Vaughn were great. Christopher Walken is a treat in any role, and Rachel McAdams was charming and beautiful. However the writing that made the beginning and middle a gut-busting comedy, soured during the dramatic ""romantic comedy"" ending. I feel like it followed the basic ""Old School"" format in that regard. It also felt a little drawn out. Some of the lines were instant classics and I'm sure I will be playing the quote game with my brother for days.I just miss the time when comedies were comedies, with some sex or romance in it. Ghostbusters, Spies like Us, Animal House, Blues Brothers....these were comedies. They didn't fall into the trap of trying to appeal to all people. I miss those movies.

"A few good moments, but a let down","Sent Wifey to pick out last night's DVD and she came back with ""Wedding Crashers"". Wasn't heaps keen to see it, but thought I'd give it a go.As the title suggests, the movie revolves around two best mates (Vaughn and Wilson) who crash weddings to pick up chicks. One day they decide to crash the biggest wedding in the country, that of a politician's daughter. While at this wedding both guys meet women who they decide they want to spend more than just one night with. Jeremy (Vaughn) meets Gloria (played by Isla Fisher, who used to be in ""Home and Away"") who soon becomes infatuated with him and becomes very possessive and creepy. One of the politician's daughters, the taken Claire (Rachel McAdams, in her best role since ""Red Eye""), catches the eye of John (Wilson). Both guys end up getting invited to an after party and it's here they have to decide their next move.Overall pretty disappointing, thanks largely to an all over the place script. Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a blokes flick? Was it directed by the Wayans brothers? It just goes of on too many tangents for my liking. It would have been far better off spending 15-20 minutes at 3 or 4 parties and them meeting the woman of their dreams. Instead we had about 1 mins footage of them at 10 different parties at the start and then the long drawn out story at the end with a bunch of interesting characters, most notably Todd, given nowhere near enough plot or screen time. Other questions:* How did Christopher Walken go from ""Deer Hunter""/""Pulp Fiction"" to ""Stepford Wives""/""Wedding Crashers""?*What was the point of Jane Seymour's character?*How many great ideas did they not utilize eg Jeremy and Todd, the football game, Will Ferrell's cameo?Shame because this could have been way better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"So enjoyable, you almost want to try crashing a wedding yourself!","One of the things movie audiences have to look forward to every summer is not only the release of several sub-par action movies, but also the inevitable arrival of the next ""frat pack comedy"". As this summer's past installment of the latter, everyone must have had a general impression of what to expect from Wedding Crashers - a simple storyline which is basically only an excuse to showcase the comedic leads, and give plenty of opportunity for improvised one-liners and other such laughs.Wedding Crashers indeed lives up to the long loved frat pack formula, but still manages to take audiences by surprise in many aspects. It certainly pushes boundaries in terms of sexual content for humor, but fear not, the jokes are never in such bad taste that they fall into the realm of ""gross-out humor"" - the movie is far too funny for that. And surely enough, the key to the film's success lies in its two leads: Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn seem to be a comedic match that was always meant to be, with the effortless ease and skill they play off each other, managing to evoke a laugh from the most mundane of situations. Between Wilson's laid back, easy going persona and Vaughn's manic fast- talking improvisational skills, every second the two are on screen they never come across as less than superbly entertaining.Unfortunately, director David Dobkin and other filmmakers are not content to make a movie revolving simply around the pair of them doing their thing - they find it necessary to convert the story into more of a clichéd romance near the end. Not only is this approach far overdone and not that enjoyable at all, but it completely clashes with the jovial mood of the first section. It was a good attempt at a more profound storyline, but ultimately the film would have been more entertaining had it taken itself a bit more lightly, and simply given Vaughn and Wilson more time to wreak havoc playing off each other. As such, it is still a highly entertaining film, but mainly worth watching for the first half or so.Although the focus is clearly on the two lead characters here, they are backed up by an excellent supporting cast as well, especially the beautiful and very talented Rachel McAdams as the object of Wilson's affections, and Isla Fisher as Vaughn's psychotic and overly clingy girlfriend. Jane Seymour also raises many a laugh (often uncomfortable ones given) as the mother of the two of them, and Christopher Walken... well, what can be said about Christopher Walken really? Suffice to say he is beyond excellent as usual, raising tears of laughter from doing virtually nothing at all.As much as I may have never expected to say this, Wedding Crashers would have been much more entertaining had it made an attempt to stick closer to the frat pack formula instead of trying to work a more serious romance element in, which clashed uncomfortably with the carefree, uplifting mood of its first half, which was much more enjoyable. Still, Wedding Crashers is nonetheless one of the very funniest movies released in a long while, and worth seeing if only for Vaughn and Wilson's unparalleled chemistry and amazing ability to play off each other. Expect to partake in many a laugh, however crude or filthy, when watching Wedding Crashers!-8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
From the stable of Faber & Fisher & Dobkin,"Life beyond Apatow World. Life for the gross-out comedy's what I mean. This isn't out and out gross but it is very fluid, of one kind or another. The story's a bit splashy too.John & Jeremy are divorce lawyers and best friends. They're also amateurs in an usual sport: crashing weddings. They show up to weddings to eat all the nibbles, chug all the booze and score with the hottest wedding guests not wearing white. Their guiding light in the art of crashing is one Chazz Reinhold. Chazz wrote the book, literally, and the J-boys can't stop quoting the rules to one another. They know the discipline, they know the plays, they've got serious game.Until they meet their match at the last wedding of the season. Cupid's bow rings out and our two horndogs are destined to go down the rocky road of love, with all its mis-steps, buckshot and soreheads. Jeremy learns that women tell tales too, and John that being honest and upfront is often the best way to go.It's fair to say that Vince Vaughn is not everyone's taste. Nor is Owen Wilson. I like em, especially together (Google movie aside). I definitely can't like Will Ferrel (Chazz) and I'm not too keen on Rachel McAdams. But the rest are all great. Bradley Cooper does a great job playing a jockstrap of a jock a-hole, the ludicrously named Sack Lodge. Walken and Seymour, and the delectable Isla Fisher, and the guy who isn't the boy from Billy Elliot, they're all great. The movie's got some real snappy dialogue in it, especially in the early stages.The romance between John and Claire is just too wishy washy to be interesting. Woody Allen must have been watching cos he cast McAdams and Owen to play vanilla opposite each other once agin, in Midnight in Paris (2011). I can't understand the nicknames the J-boys have for one another. Tazmanian Devil, for a blonde Owen Wilson? And why Baba Ganoush for a strapping fellow like Vaughn? There's also the issue of the private detective as a plot device. How, given that the J-boys are there under false pretences, with false names and bogus career details, could a private detective so quickly ascertain their real identities AND their history of crashing weddings? They've been using different false names at all the different weddings, and they are the only thing that links them. It's a false note. One might also question the appropriateness of John interrupting the final wedding ceremony in order to plead his case. Kind of bad taste, don't you think.Oh, and Ferrel does a sadly highly effective job playing a nauseating manchild.But hey, at least it's not Apatow.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"2/3 of a raucous,funny summer movie is better than none at all","This summer comedy--a ""sex comedy"",if you will--is a great romp for the first 2/3 and a passable,if unremarkable and even somewhat cloying,final third.Jeremy and John(Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson,both terrific here!)are WAshington D.C. arbitration lawyers who have become ace practitioners of going on the make at a variety of weddings in the D.C. area. They are lithe and enthusiastic in plying their craft,bedding as many cute,willing-to-marry honeys and leaving behind little or no trace of themselves along the way. Their ability to mold into differing weddings of various religions and cultures is a feat to behold,an nearly athletic endeavor of achievement. Alas,they,while completely carnally satisfied,find themselves at a point of emptiness. They're getting older(read:late thirties)and yet feeling like they're missing...something. Prety familiar stuff so far,but still done with a deft touch.As fate would have it,they target the wedding of the oldest daughter of a prominent government official(Christopher Walken,well-cast)and set their sights on his two younger daughters(RAchel McAdams and Isla Fisher,both sexy and very charming). However,the boys cleave ways when they discover their targeted conquests are far more than they bargained for.Director David Dobkin and writer Bob Fisher(there's another writer credited. I forget at this moment whom) are able to make this film both clever and yet familiar,sexy and yet sweet and the ability of the actors(Vaughn mostly)to ad-lib through the film make this film as fluid as it is kinetic. Add in Dr.Quinn herself,one JAne Seymour,as the horny,bitter wife of Walken's character to the mix and you have one largely entertaining comedy that screams ""Summer flick!"" all over.

"Good, but seeping with wasted opportunities","One thing must be said right at the beginning - Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson have the best on-screen buddy-buddy chemistry since Gibson and Glover in Lethal Weapon 1. You could watch these guys discuss the political situation in Zaire and still have a great time. Anyway, on with the comment.The premise of the ""Wedding Crashers) actually has loads of potential - just look at it. Two guys who in spite of being ""not so young"" (in their own words) lead a hedonistic lifestyle of wedding-crashing and sleeping with beautiful women suddenly find themselves taking a much larger bite then they can swallow while crashing a wedding of a big-shot minister. This comedy has all the right ingredients - mistaken identities, crazy relatives, snappy conversations, slapstick humor, you name it. Top it with a great cast and two almost perfect leads and you really have a sleeper hit on your hands.Or not. This movie could serve as a school example for how sloppy directing and editing can really work against the movie itself. There are so many scenes that really verge on being hilarious, yet they either end too suddenly or just stretch themselves too long so they lose all their oomph. Consider the opening wedding-crash montage - it just goes on and on. The freaking thing never ends. Or (not to say too much to avoid spoilers) the bondage scene - it's great, it's funny, yet it's seeping with wasted potential. I shouldn't even mention the surprise cameo that happens near the end - while I appreciate the work of the actor in question, his inclusion seems like an afterthought which serves nothing except unnecessarily prolonging the movie for extra 20 minutes.I must admit that this IS a feel-good movie - you know the kind. It's a movie you have fun watching and you feel a sorta half-smile never leaving your face. Yet that smile rarely becomes a true laugh - you feel it coming, you know there something really funny right down the corner, yes, here it is...aaand, no, back to the half-smile again. And you'll be doing this right up to the ending credits (which in my opinion could really benefit from some goofs and screw-ups from the shooting itself - I was really eager to see some REAL Vaughn-Wilson interaction instead of a sloppily directed one).Anyway, this is a good movie, an entertaining movie, a Hollywood comedy that is actually funny - which has become a rarity lately - yet don't go with very high expectations (which could be the case, especially after reading some of the raving reviews circulating here).",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
So bad I walked out,"The success of this movie is a good measure of the state of Hollywood and specifically romantic comedy this summer.Actually I was amused by the concept and the early montage of weddings was fun, but when the real body of the plot began it became truly painful to watch as it became as mean-spirited as the wedding toast ""Claire"" begins to make.When the man slips on the banana peel it's only funny if he leaps up unhurt, if he has earned the punishment or if the humor is otherwise balanced with caring. The only people who earned their punishment in this movie were the leads and the rival for Claire's affection (After all, he was working to care for the environment and house the homeless. How evil can you be!). Jeremy's hell night might have been amusing if his torturers hadn't been so pathetic.You're better off staying home with some classic comedies.

"Wilson + Vaughn = Unmissable (well, most of the time)","After playing second fiddle to Ben Stiller in Zoolander, Starsky & Hutch and Dodgeball, Vince Vaughn (who also had a supporting role in Old School, which starred Luke Wilson) and Owen Wilson (Luke's brother) finally get to carry their own Frat Pack movie, and the results aren't as sharp as when Stiller's involved. Why? Probably because Wedding Crashers is a romantic comedy - albeit of the weird kind - and therefore things tend to get messy from a strictly narrative standpoint, especially in the third act.The story is about two divorce mediators, John Beckwith (Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vaughn), who spend their free time going to as many weddings as possible (uninvited, of course, otherwise it would be no fun), so they can drink free booze and seduce as many hot chicks as possible. Things get complicated at the latest wedding, when John falls in love with the Treasury Secretary's (Christopher Walken) daughter (the simply wonderful Rachel McAdams), while Jeremy ends up with her sister Gloria(Isla Fisher, hilarious). From there on, hell breaks loose, be it in the form of hunting trips, kinky nighttime sex games or horny middle-aged mothers (that would be Jane Seymour).The real heart of Wedding Crashers is Wilson and Vaughn: one provides the sweet stuff (though not in a sickly way) thanks to good chemistry with McAdams, the other goes straight for the belly-laughs and scores gloriously, most memorably in the already classic family dinner scene. From the very beginning, when an Animal House-like montage shows their MO, it's clear their very real friendship is the main reason to see the movie, which manages to be one of the funniest films of 2005 for about 50 minutes.What happens then? Well, the script runs out of energy when it has to tie everything up, and so we get dull subplots and a Will Ferrell cameo which, while fun, was clearly added because there was nothing else to do. Hell, even Christopher Walken appears to be clueless in the final act. Fortunately, the ending doesn't get too sloppy thanks to, you guessed it, Vaughn and Wilson. Next time, though, a little more care during the writing process wouldn't hurt.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Hilarious and surprisingly heartwarming,"Largely entertaining, incredibly funny, and surprisingly thoughtful- Wedding Crashers is so much more than an average buddy comedy- and somehow is able to prove itself to become one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn make a fantastic pair, and the two's chemistry is quite impressive. Their performances are very comedic, but well done, and most of the actors involved give an equally impressive job. Rachel McAdams and Isla Fisher are perfect for their roles, both providing (as often weddings do) something new and something old to their acting career list. The film is written surprisingly well, with a fair amount of heart and emotion- in addition to some truly hilarious gags and situations. The timing is everything in this film, and it seems to nail every mark, and honestly kinda stunned me to like it as much as I did. In the end, Wedding Crashers is an extremely enjoyable film that isn't perfect, but damn near close to it.

Needless to say, much buffoonery and attempts at merriment ensue. Mostly, I found myself barely sniggering but there are a few memorable moments. The one-on-one scene between the Secretary's odd son and Vince Vaughn is one where I laughed out loud and some of the best moments are when Owen Wilson goes to meet the original Wedding Crasher, called Chaz, played by the show stealing Will Ferrell. Walkin is sadly under used which is a real shame as good use of his character could have added more to the uneven comedy. The two main girls look good and carry off their roles quite well but Vaughn and Wilson seem, despite their hell-raising roles, to be on cruise control and subdued. Overall, if you're after laughs you'll get a couple here but don't expect your sides to split!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Lots of profanity ruined the film.,"The trend these days in comedy is to use profanity as much as actually speaking. Almost every foul language imagined was used in Wedding Crashers when you really didn't have to go to that extreme. 40-Year Old Virgin did the same thing.Almost no one, unless their in Hollywood, uses this much profanity. If you had a foul mouth at work, you'd soon have the boss telling you to cool it. If you used this much profanity with friends, you'd have none...unless you work in Hollywood.But if you look at Bruce Almighty, Meet the Parents, Shrek, Anger Management, Big Fat Greek Wedding, etc. they still did killer business, but didn't resort to 'gross foul language'. Disappointing considering the director of 'Wedding' did the much much better film 'Shanghai Knights' that had almost no foul language yet was 20 times funnier.The point is that in Middle America, where most decent people live, the only time someone swears is when their really mad.People over 25 are gradually waning from going to the theaters anymore. The population grew last year by 5% to 360 million Americans. Yet the box office attendance has declined 20% since 1990. Hmmmm.....",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wedding Crashers,"The Frat-Pack, are surely the hardest working collective in Hollywood. Hardly a month goes by without a movie featuring Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jack Black, Will Ferrell, or those Wilson boys Luke and Owen being released.When Starsky and Hutch paired Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller it was good, when Dodgeball put Vince Vaughn with Ben Stiller it was better, but ""Wedding Crashers"" could well be the finest Frat-Pack pairing to date.Although Wilson and Vaughn have appeared in four movies together so far, this is the first where they've both taken star billing. In ""Wedding Crashers"", John Beckwith (Wilson) and Jeremy Klein (Vaughn), are a pair of divorce mediators whose passion in life is sneaking into weddings to take advantage of the free food.. and of course score with girls.They have a strict 'crashers rulebook', which dictates the etiquette of the pick-up, such as 'never use your real name'. It also suggests, by behaving raucously, loudly and generally being the life-and-soul, people will think you're so obnoxious, you can't not have been invited.The pair eventually find themselves at odds with each other when John meets and falls for a bridesmaid at the Washington society wedding of the year.Although ""Wedding Crashers"" is at times formulaic, the comic performances raise this movie above par and in lesser hands the main characters could have descended into Rom-Com cliché. The fast-talking machine-gun delivery of Vaughn is the perfect accompaniment to Wilson's laconic style. Their single-guy banter's often painfully accurate, as is the acknowledgement they're both a little too old to be acting so carelessly. There are also some great comic set-pieces too, notably the divorce meeting, the weddings montage, the cringe-worthy football game and the hunting trip.The supporting cast are also an asset, Christopher Walken expertly walks the tightrope of being both broodingly intimidating and likable, while Rachel McAdams' 'Claire' has a charming vulnerability and an easy-to-fall-in love with quality. Former ""Home and Away"" pin-up Isla Fisher however, is less convincing.I admit ""Wedding Crashers"" is far from perfect, at time situations seem too contrived, the nudity is laughably gratuitous, and Claire's evil fiancée Sack (Bradley Cooper) is an almost too heavy-handed device to make Wilson look good.But if you can look past all that, and simply accept it for what it is, you're left with a very funny film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Really hilarious...,"""Wedding Crashers"" is a hilarious movie which has to do with two best friends who are always sneak into weddings to get in touch with women and with the romance of the wedding succeed their purpose. Also in this movie we watch them sneak into a wedding but this time they did not have the luck to their side because one of them fell in love with one woman and there the laugh begins.In this movie we have a great combination of romance with laugh and comedy, and we can observe how people change when they meet their true love and they have to fight for it. I liked this movie because of the plot and direction of it and because of the interpretations of Owen Wilson who plays as John Beckwith and Vince Vaughn who plays as Jeremy Grey and they are simply outstanding.Finally I have to tell you that ""Wedding Crashers"" is a really great and hilarious movie with which I am sure that you will spend nice your spare time and with many laughs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Wedding Crashers and Old School is our  generation's Caddyshack and Animal House,"I always used to be jealous of my father because he got to see Animal House and Caddyshack in the theater. That was his generation. He loved them. He wouldn't let me watch them. They were inappropriate movies. They swore and sometimes showed naked chicks. He called me Flounder when I screwed up. He would trade weird lines with his golf buddies. I hated it. As I got older and the only movies that were coming out were marginal comedies like Happy Gilmore and Austin Powers, I began to think that the great adult comedies had died thanks to the PG-13 rating.Then one day a movie called Old School came out and my faith began to return. Here was a movie that was written for me, not for the jack-off 9th grader. It had bad language and boobs. And it was hilarious. Its plot was good enough, but it had three actors that were completely on top of their slack/frat game. And I felt that I was close, extremely close.I declare that a golden age has returned. The crown jewel of which is the movie ""Wedding Crashers."" The quotable and entertaining adult comedy has returned and it is stomping out worthless corporate TV show retread movies and CGI garbage in its wake.Enjoy these times fellow movie watchers.

"Great Perfformances, But....","Wedding Crashers is a 2005 romantic comedy that follows the adventures of John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn), two divorce mediators who crash weddings to meet women. The movie's plot is predictable, but the actors' performances are top-notch.The comedic timing and chemistry between Wilson and Vaughn are spot-on, and they play off each other's strengths brilliantly. The movie's funniest scenes come from their banter and zany antics.However, the movie's biggest flaw is its lack of a satisfying conclusion. The final act feels rushed, and the resolution feels unearned. The movie's attempts to balance raunchy humor with genuine emotion also fall flat, making the film feel tonally inconsistent.Overall, Wedding Crashers is an enjoyable comedy that delivers plenty of laughs, but its flaws prevent it from being a truly great film. Despite its shortcomings, it is worth watching for the chemistry between its two leads and ffor the many times where the humor is simply laugh-out-loud quality.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn 'crash,' the movie doesn't","It's a recurring theme in movies: people break rules, but they do it to get things done in their own way and to get it done right. 'Wedding Crashers' is almost a parody of that recurring theme with John and Jeremy, two best friends who happen to be swingers, crash weddings in order to get at the many desirable single young women that attend them. To say that they get things done would be putting it lightly, because they do and do they ever!The real interesting part begins when things don't go quite as planned at one wedding and John doesn't ""seal the deal"" before the end of the reception and might have real feelings for one of the girls. Jeremy sticks by him and they end up going to the weekend retreat of the family whose wedding they've ""crashed."" And that just happens to be the family of a high ranking political official. Thus there is a great conflict with John and Jeremy's hectic lifestyle and the strict law and order of Capitol Hill. And the cast makes it work wonderfully. John being confronted by the family's sexually repressed matriarch then being teased by Jeremy about it. Jeremy having a surprise visit at night from the family's eccentric son. It is all silly sex humor, but it is well done and, very importantly, not overdone. The humorous crux of the film does not lay on sex gags, but rather with our characters. No part of the film feels like they left it in just to have that joke at that moment.The best part of the whole film is that it keeps this theme throughout. Even at the ending. Endings often seem rushed or contrived or unrealistically good and cheesy, here I found this ending to quite unlike that. I feared it might bring down the film by trying to be ""all good and happy"" and it is to a degree. However, there are several ups and downs that realistically set it up as such. Thus it is not contrived. Though it may seem a little rushed due to the fact that the second act of the film takes place during a few days, while the third act is much more stretched out with many leaps in time. But still, as 'Team America' told us, when you need to show that time has passed 'use a montage.' --- 9/10Rated R for profanity and sexual content. Ages 13+",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

By trying to re-hash a character persona that was done so well in other movies, (Swingers, Old School), all he did was come off as annoying and un-funny.Throughout the film, all I could think was ""this is the biggest disappointment since I was forced to sit through 'Anchorman''It had SO MUCH comedy potential that was never tapped into, and it felt like I was watching first time actors.The movie is so predictable that you only need to see the first 30 minutes of it, because you'll know exactly what's going to happen throughout the rest.

"Too long, but an enjoyable Wedding","A very funny and entertaining R rated comedy starring Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as divorce mediators who in their spare time like to crash weddings and meet chicks. They do it as a way to scam food, get laid, and basically to have loads of fun. This aspect is fun for the audience too, as we get an extended montage of our two friends crashing about 17 weddings and getting in all kinds of conquests, eating loads of food, and getting jiggy with it with many different cultures. But when the mother of all weddings comes around, they just have to go and try and do the ultimate con. Needless to say our two heroes get way more than they bargain for.The wedding is being thrown by a Washington senator (Christopher Walken) and when Wilson first lays eyes on one of his daughters played by the pretty Rachel McAdams, it's love at first sight. When he learns that she is unavailable, he convinces Vaughn to stick around for some overtime so he can win her from her beau and soon both of them are in over their head. Vaugn's troubles only just begin when the other daughter can't keep her hands off him as well as the Senator's gay outcast son. Throw in a horny wife played by Jane Seymour and a psycho 90 year old toilet mouthed grandma.There are some big laughs and most of the film works. My complaint is that this film is about 20 minutes too long and there is a big chunk towards the end that could have been taken out because the film seems to drone on for awhile at that point. This is still a very enjoyable film that will make you laugh a lot. (***)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A sure-fire cult classic,"Vince Vaughan is Hollywood's most underrated funny man. In Wedding Crashers, Vaughan plays Jeremy Grey, a wise-cracking serial wedding crasher intent on picking up as many girls as possible. He is joined by his best friend, John Beckwith (Owen Wilson). Together the two wreak havoc on the weddings of total strangers, as they sleep with a bevy of beautiful women.When our two conniving heroes crash the town's biggest wedding, things start to go awry. Beckwith becomes immediately smitten with Claire Cleary (played with ease by Rachel McAdams). To make matters worse, Claire is the daughter of Treasury Secretary William Cleary (a brilliant Christopher Walken). Meanwhile at the same wedding Grey meets Gloria Cleary (played by Aussie starlet Isla Fisher). While she seems nice enough, Grey quickly discovers she is not what he expected. The rest of the movie follows the two leads as they weasel their way into the Cleary family circle, all the while trying to win the hearts of their respective crushes. While the movie (and subsequently the laughs) fall away slightly near the end, there is no doubt this movie will become a cult classic over time. There's even an unnecessary, terrible cameo from Will Ferrell (hey, I love the guy but he is useless in this). Vaughan is clearly having a ball in this, while Wilson does a great job of playing the foil. Pop this DVD in the player and enjoy a riotous time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Decent adult fun,"This new offering in adult comedy is a decent show, provided you enjoy Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. Some people love the Holiday season, some may love the crisp air of Fall, John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) love wedding season. They do their research into upcoming weddings, come up with their game plan and backstory for each, and show up.With so many strangers showing up to a wedding, these two zany gentleman can show up, and no ones the wiser. After a great (lengthy) montage into crashing, we move into the real story, the crash of all crashes.

Which I guarantee so will you the audience.Invited for a weekend at the Cleary household, hilarity ensues, especially between Jeremy and his clingy bridesmaid, Gloria (Isla Fisher). In the second half of the movie, the story shifts, Vaughn becoming more the supporting role, and Wilson's love story taking center stage.Performances here are decent for this type of comedy. There is great chemistry between these two actors, Vaughn playing the sleazier of two roles, and Wilson the straight (yet not completely straight) man falling head over heels in love.

"Not just Comedy Genius, but a realistic look at American culture","While this movie has reached critical acclaim, many people don't realize the realism behind the scenes. While these realisms are significant, many examples come from the very small specifics behind the acting and scenarios. A significant part of the success of this movie is the ability of the story to relate to modern day American single males ages 18-35. The movie portrays 2 men who are sexually motivated in their extra-curricular activities. The movie does a wonderful example of portraying American cultural flaws through classism, culturalism, and sexuality. Particularly, the movie shows the consistencies between money, family, relationships, and their effects on one another.One of the best parts of this movie is the fact that every character is properly cast, and provide brilliant performances. Even a late cameo by a reknown star provides effective enough humor for the hysterical atmosphere; although most would argue that the cameo isn't meant to be taken seriously. While the movie does drag on a bit towards the end, it provides effective entertainment all the way through.The only shortcoming behind this movie is the fact that many older crowds won't be able to relate to the material at all. In fact, many of the elderly crowds won't want to accept many of the cultural portrayals as reality seeing as though there is satirical implications to the upper class and the male sex drive. Additionally, women (usually older women as younger women now have commonly reformed to open sexuality or befriending Men who relate to these characters) won't be able to relate to the characters or necessarily want to sympathize with them due to their sexual motivations; the main characters while being portrayed as ""heroes"", in theory are motivated in a sleezy fashion.Overall, most people don't recognize that the reason why these jokes work, is the ability to make fun of the cultural identifiers that people recognize about the upper class and men looking to have a good time. This movie should be cherished by anyone who's looking for a good comedy. Anyone who doesn't appreciate this movie can't relate to it, and doesn't want to accept these characters as realistic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I can't believe we sat through the whole thing.,"It's too bad I couldn't rate this on a scale of ZERO to 10 because 0 is what I would have picked.DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT waste your money to see this thing. The trailers do not depict the actual sleaze and disrespectful attitude towards so many things in this movie. And we only saw it by accident. We were headed to a theater to see something else and that theater was actually closed for the day in remembrance of someone from that town who had passed away so we headed to another place. The only thing showing at the time we arrived was this one that is trying to be passed off as entertainment.The presentation that just about every woman is an airhead on some emotional roller coaster and easily bedded by two ""organized"" crashers is appalling. I don't know about the reputation of all the other actors, but now Jane Seymour can join the list of those soiled by the need for something (a career revival, money, who knows) and now join that long list who allow their brains to be checked at the door when allowing themselves to be cast in a part.The two others who went with me talked about it afterward and could only come up with one thing to take away that was positive and it was a quote about love. But that quote was oh so lost behind all the rest of the gutter stuff in this film.Save your money, don't dream about owning this one, run as fast as you can in another direction.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The best comedy of the summer!,"The premise behind WEDDING CRASHERS is one that surprisingly has never been made into a movie before. Two guys (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn) crash weddings to pick up chicks. It's such a simple and fun premise, which could have quickly got old fast had it been in the hands of the wrong director or screenwriters. Luckily, director David Dobkin and screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher proved to be just the right filmmakers for the job. That's not to say that WEDDING CRASHERS is perfect. It's far from it. What starts off as a throwback to such raunchy classic R-rated comedies such as ANIMAL HOUSE and PORKY'S soon becomes entangled in becoming a romance where towards the end it becomes clichéd predictable, and overly long. Still, I'm giving it a high ranking due to the chemistry of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. The duo of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in WEDDING CRASHERS is so inspired and brilliant it's amazing that no one thought of pairing them up before. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson go together like peanut butter and jelly. I would love to see them do another movie together. Hopefully WEDDING CRASHERS will be a big hit at the box office and there will be a re-teaming of the great duo. 7/10.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Crash Landing,"Earlier reviews tell enough about the ""Wedding Crashers"" story that I will skip the summary and just dive right into my thoughts and commentary: The Wedding Crashers is a very good comedy. There are some moments of adult sexual humor, so do not take the kiddies to see this movie. Wedding Crashers is a fun movie with a great deal of laughs. Vince Vaughn is excellent as Jeremy Grey. This is Vaughn premiere role and well worth seeing. The other spectacular performance is by Isla Fisher. Isla Fisher is extraordinary as Gloria Cleary. If Marisa Tomei can win an Oscar from her average performance in ""My Cousin Vinny, then Isla Fisher deserves an Oscar for her comedic role in the Wedding Crashers. Yes, she is that good. Fisher steals each and every scene she is in. She devours her role and sinks her teeth into every line that she delivers. Vaughn and Fisher are the reasons to see this movie and both are worth the admission price. As for Wilson and McAdams: they are there and fulfill the require roles. But as the two main characters, they are severely lacking compared to Jeremy and Gloria.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I also love the way this movie depicts all the different types of wedding ceremonies that each culture and nationality celebrate.And even though I really hope that no men of that age,(they seem to be in their late 30's, it wouldn't have been as pathetic if they were college students) are actually crashing weddings to sleep with women...I still enjoyed the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funny...for the most part,"The thing that attracted me to this movie is the fact that it stars two of the funniest men in Hollywood today. Now, the movie was very funny at the beginning, and then, it just gradually slumped down a bit, but that's okay. The reason this is okay is because since Owen Wilson brings the movie's comedy down a bit, Vince Vaughn is there to kick it up two notches higher each time. Of course, a movie always has to have the straight-laced guy, and then the crazy/hilarious guy. This movie also had one of the hottest girls in the movie business today...Rachel McAdams. There is much more comedy that there is romance in this comedy, but still, it has some kinda dramatic scenes in the end. They're not heartbreaking scenes, they're just kinda depressing.

a great movie that provides a wonderful comedic experience,"Wedding Crashers, one of the top comedies of 2005, is a great comedy because it will appeal to so many different kinds of people. The teenagers are going to love it (it's too much for kids under 14), adults will have a blast, and everyone in between will have some good laughs to remember. Starring comedic powerhouses Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, Wedding Crashers is a sure bet if you're looking for a fun time.John (Wilson) and Jeremy (Vaughn) are divorce counselors whose hobby is crashing weddings. Yes, it's really ironic. The dynamic duo have every part of the crash planned from the get go. Slap on a new name, a reasonable backstory, and a big smile, and they're ready to go eat, drink, and mingle with the women at each ceremony. The only thing they aren't prepared for is one of them falling hard for a bridesmaid (Rachel McAdams) who is the daughter of the Secretary of State (Christopher Walken).The acting is extremely good, and when you've got the comedic talents of Wilson, Vaughn, and Walken, it's hard not to be good. Although Wilson and Vaughn play the same characters we're used to over and over, they're at their best here. Wilson's typical slacker always has a sweet side, and here is no different. He and McAdams have nice chemistry, despite the fact that he's far from her in age. Vaughn's quick thinking and sarcastic Jeremy is probably one of the best comedic performances of recent memory, and in 2005, it's second to only Steve Carell in The 40 Year Old Virgin. His interactions with Walken's son and other daughter, played by Isla Fisher, are off the wall hilarious. Fisher plays a crazy character that can get annoying sometimes, but will make you wide-eyed at how insane she is. Fisher does a great job of making moments that sound cute and funny sound almost scary in a funny way. Rachel McAdams is at her best here, as her character is extremely likable, as she always is (except for Mean Girls, of course). McAdams has a subtle trait in her that makes her so special as an actress, the way she can catch the audience. It's a rare quality that few actresses possess.The humor is everywhere from simply brainless to clever and witty. Some jokes are complex, while some are potty jokes. Vaughn does his thing with the angry and impatient jokes, as well as the sarcasm. Wilson's humor is mostly slapstick and simple, but he does it very well. Walken brings intensity and humor together and meshes them perfectly for a good performance. Wedding Crashers is a must see for fans of any of the actors, but I think everyone will come away from it laughing at least a few times, even if they don't like it. It's a memorable experience that you shouldn't take for granted. Take it from me, it's a wonderful movie.9/10 --spy",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Wavy Davy Review - Wedding Crashers,"John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn) are two divorce mediators from Washington who carry out the immature activity of crashing weddings. Their mission - to eat food, hook up with women and generally have a good time. Problems arise when John falls for Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams), daughter of senator John Cleary (Christopher Walken), while Jeremy is left with the crazy daughter, Gloria (Isla Fischer).This comedy feels fresh due to its likable cast and varied nature of the jokes. While the plot is quite formulaic, the gags generally work, and even Christopher Walken cannot ruin this. In a time while the legendary actor seems to be taking roles crazily, this film actually fits him well, straying away from his routine evil mode.There are some elements to this film which make it a highly enjoyable watch. The likability of the funny Wilson and Vaughn despite their sleazy lives creates a genuine interest in how events will pan out. There are some really cheesy, yet enjoyable romantic asides, especially between Wilson and McAdams, although Isla Fischers over the top Gloria is less enjoyable.There are extremely funny small roles, which keeps the film moving along and keeps the level of laughs high. Christopher Walken's wife and son have some very funny scenes which are unexpected and refreshing. The cherry on the top, however, is a hilarious role from Will Ferrell as Chazz Reinhold, the creator of crashing weddings. This film is worthwhile just to see his very funny portrayal which lifts the movie to its obvious, up-beat ending.The charisma of Wilson and Vaughn, aided by Walken and, latterly, Ferrel, make this film a superior comedy, encouraging me to give it 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Vaughn and Wilson are terrific,"Wedding Crashers is downright hilarious at times, thanks mainly to the chemistry of it's two stars, though especially Vince Vaughn, who really shines here as the film progresses. Putting aside the fact that the film, nor any of these characters, seem authentic in the least, the film manages to entertain through sheer willingness of everybody involved.It's a bit mushy at times, that ending, I mean how many times do they wrap up these comedies in that fashion, with the hero confessing his love in front of everybody. Well, I could do without it. There are some real cardboard one-dimensional characters here, but hey, let's not nit-pick here, after all, I did laugh out loud on many occasions and left feeling mostly satisfied.

"Better than ""Dodgeball"" but a highly overrated movie.","I've been waiting a while in anticipation to watch this at the cinemas because of the excellent reviews i've read about this film, little did I know that I was in for one of the most overrated American comedies ever. OK don't get me wrong but i'm still stunned about the fact that this has an average rating for 7.4 / 10 on this site. Which generally is for great comedies, I'm not sure why this movie even got got reviews from all the critics, maybe the world of movies have sunk to a new low?. If your a Vince Vaughn Or Owen Wilson fan you will laugh out loud in some of the scenes that they show, but the movie itself is a lot longer than it needed to be & did drag on in some scenes, the Aussie actress Isla Fischer was the funniest character after the main two stars, she really did stand out with her crazy hyper acting. I went to watch this movie with a group of 8 people 3 people liked it a lot, 4 people hated it & 1 thought it was OK, my overall rating is 6.5 / 10, truly an overrated comedy but maybe a little more fun to watch if you are a little drunk.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Nice frat pack offering in a more dramatic shade,Wedding Crashers is a good film. Although it is labeled as a comedy I'd consider it more drama than comedy. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn partner as wedding crashers to sleep with the bridesmaids. One such detour results in one of them falling for a girl and another in a casual dalliance with her sister. Nice to see Bradley Cooper in a negative shade though this was before he was really a star. Christopher Walken is sublime and overall this is a good film.,6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I had a blast watching this film!,"""Wedding Crashers"" is without a doubt one of the best comedies that I have seen recently. Every person on this Earth must have told me at least one good thing about this film. I'm so glad that I watched it, for the most part, I'm just going to tell which sequences I enjoyed the most and you would get a kick out of as well.One of the rules for these wedding crashers is that they do not take a girl's ""virginity"" because she might get attached, when Vince's character is not aware that the girl he just slept with was a virgin, she goes crazy on him and he just wants to get away from her. The scene where he is in bed with her and she's trying to get an ""adventurous"" side for him, I was on the floor laughing. It's just a great movie and Owen and Vince had great comedic chemistry.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Funny Scenes and an Entertaining Cast,","Wedding Crashers is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic comedic cast.I am not a huge fan of either Vince Vaughn or Owen Wilson,they are very hit and miss actors,but they both strike gold in their performances in this and there is great chemistry between them,and this also features several other great actors such as Rachel McAdams,Christopher Walken,Isla Fisher,Bradley Cooper in one of his first big roles,and an unforgettable cameo from the briliiant Will Ferrell that was without a doubt the highlight of the movie.There are a few hit and miss jokes and the movie is certainly longer than it needs to be,but Wedding Crashers is still a very fun and enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy.John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) specialize in crashing weddings as a way of picking up girls.Things have been going great for them for many years,until one unexpectedly falls in love with someone.Best Performance: Vince Vaughn",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Cute, crude, and largely illogical . . .","'Wedding Crashers' is not the sort of flick I take in very often - I am not a great a fan of crude, gross-out, low-brow humour.This movie did have some very funny moments, especially when Vince Vaughn's Jeremy character goes off on a tangent.The premise is interesting at best - confirmed bachelors & divorce arbitrators seeking female 'companionship' at weddings, only to avoid commitment in any form.Of course the flick could not just be the crashing of weddings, so it evolves (sort of) into a romantic comedy where-in both our leads find true love.The problem I had with the movie was the lack of logic displayed at various times: Distant relatives of the Secretary of the Treasury are invited to his house by the shore without their bona fides being confirmed. In reality they'd have been thoroughly vetted before getting within 20 meters of a cabinet secretary and presidential candidate.The hot-to-trot mature mother comes on to one of the leads, presents herself in a state of semi-undress, and then . . . disappears from the plot.This could have been an up-dated 'Mrs. Robinson' theme, and used as a bedroom farce, with people chasing other people around the house in the dead of night, but once she's had her kit off in John's presence, she fades into the back-ground.The boyfriend, Sack, is a total, vicious psychopath, but nobody seems to notice it but our leads, and the audience. When Sack SHOOTS Jeremy, no police are called, no doctor is summoned to administer to Jeremy (nutty Gloria is chosen to extract the shot from Jeremy's behind!), and Jeremy is sitting normally within minutes. The entire hunting scene is merely gratuitous violence coupled with an incomplete thought process.The gay son's character was totally wasted. Todd makes it plain he feels alienated from his otherwise politically correct family, and that could have been used to the advantage of one of the leads.Just as John dances with flower girls at wedding receptions to gain favour with the admiring single women in attendance, he could have befriended Todd to display his sensitivity to Clare. Instead Todd is used as a gay cliché, climbing on top of the already trussed and helpless Jeremy.John's drunken wedding-crashing rampage after the rejection by Clare is somewhat, if not totally, out of character. The boozing, brooding rejected boyfriend thing has been done to death.Perhaps most perplexing is hypocritical reactions both leads display when informed their partner is in love or getting married. Jeremy rejects John's feelings at breakfast at the house by the shore; when Jeremy announces his engagement to Gloria, John insults Jeremy and tells him in no uncertain terms to leave.If John had a shred of the intellect he'd displayed over and over again, he would have known the Jeremy - Gloria wedding activities would have given him the opportunity to get close to Clare.Instead he looks up perennial loser and funeral crasher Chas . . .Some of the stuff was funny, but much was just plain old ludicrous.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great Except for Bad Beginning,"Aside from the first 20 minutes or so, which seem to have been written, directed and acted while everyone was in need of laxatives, this is a classic. It does take a lot from ""Meet the Parents"" and the likes, for its setup, but has enough amazing, fresh material to pull it off as a great, all guys/gal night out main or pre-event.The nice surprise in this one aside from an exceptional cameo from a big name, was Isla Fisher's show-stealing performance. It was the first time I saw her on screen, and something tells me I will see her again. Near the end of the movie, she cracked me up just by being on screen. Very good looking and very talented.If you did not like these gentlemen's previous deliveries (e.g. Dodgeball, Old School, Anchorman, etc.), I doubt you will enjoy this one, so a DVD rental may be the best option.

Good movie,"This was a decent enough movie. I enjoyed the characters quite a bit. Not VERY, VERY funny though. Good story, the wedding crasher theme IS a really good plot thread. There is a nice montage with the guys getting with all of their different women, including nudity (on the part of the women) which is something you don't see too much anymore in today's PG-13 rated world. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are true to their normal character patterns talking up a storm in their meandering-but-oh-so-enjoyable way.

Wedding Crashers,"""He thought ""Moby Dick"" was a venereal disease"" - made me smile at the start of this, but after I while I really did wonder if it was ever going to end! ""John"" (Owen Wilson) and his pal ""Jeremy"" (Vince Vaughn) are a couple of amorous types who have quite a successful habit of crashing other folks weddings - usually without knowing a soul - and chancing their arm amongst the hormonally vulnerable. Then something unexpected happens and they end up at the mansion of the US Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken) where the most convoluted of love pentangles occurs between the two boys, ""Claire"" (Rachel McAdams), ""Gloria"" (Isla Fisher) and the pompous ""Sack"" (Bradley Cooper) - and that's before ""Todd, the gay son of the house (Keir O'Donnell) takes a bit of a shine to one of them, too! Not only has romance gone into overdrive, but the relationship between the men is starting to strain. Thing is, the family believe the boys are something quite different from their real selves, and the question is as inevitable as the sun coming up. Will they get found out or be forced to admit who they really are, and will they escape with their lives? It has it's moments this, but it's far too long and padded out with most of the fun out of the way after the first twenty minutes. That leaves us with an increasingly orchestrated series of escapades along the rather puerile lines of ""American Pie"". These men do have comedy timing and their delivery is slick nd professional, but their humour is childish and predictable, as are the scenarios and jokes. It's not that it's bad, it's just dated and unsophisticated. Ellen Albertini Dow quite engagingly keeps up the spirit of Una O'Connor and Mlldred Natwick as the outrageous and curmudgeonly grandmother, but otherwise this wasn't really for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The typical American comedy... works pretty well.,"A very entertaining and funny comedy for those who enjoy American comedies. Otherwise, if you expect a smart, edgy comedy, well look elsewhere. I watched it when it first came out in theaters and I had a really good time with it.The on-screen duo of Vaughn and Owen works really well because both show great chemistry between them. The funny situations are held by scatological and sexual situations so you may go figure.The acting is pretty good for the movie's standards. Rachel McAdams is extremely beautiful and talented, too bad her talent is wasted. Isla Fisher is hot as hell and delivers some really funny situations.The cameos work also really well.

Of course you'll see noticeable plot twists, but it is a guy-wants-girl-but-can't-have-her comedy with shenanigans-a-plenty and quotes and quips that you'll be saying weeks after watching it. Between Vaughn's quick witted jokes and phrases and Wilson's slow but straight delivery you have the best comedic duo since Laurel and Hardy.

Old School V2,"When venturing into the theaters, I had expected Wedding Crashers to be a movie which compared to one such as ""American Pie.""

Isla Fisher is also excellent as the besotted psycho lover of Vaughan, Jane Seymour is, um, looking healthy for her age, though Christopher Walkens role is a bit in the background, I guess you are so used to him as a figure of menace, here he is no more than a caring Father.The final 20 minutes or so is rather stretched out with a slightly pointless, but amusing, appearance from Will Ferrell ""MOM!

'We're getting a nice preview of what marriage is gonna be like with Ike Turner over here.',"was having a really crap birthday and i thought id end it on a crap note by seeing this film. I read poor reviews about the first third being good and the rest being cheesy etc-etc. so my hopes weren't high.However,although i hope they don't milk this idea and make a franchise out of it, like the typical clichéd Hollywood bean-counting machine that it is , i might rent this when its on DVD. its that good.Vince with his p*ssed off frustration, and Owen' calm gentle intelligent reasoning make a great team. even Walken paled in comparison to these two. hey it was for the paycheck, but he's one of the few Hollywood icons i can say has actually earnt it. but these two...they just totally stole the show and if they ad-libbed stuff it worked really well.the girl - the one that Wilson's after, smiles like a toothpaste ad and has as much range as my left buttock....but as shes another IMDb 'up and coming' wannabe ill let her off. but commercial love-interest blandness aside, the sheer comic energy of these two is enough to overpower any cliché and cheesy line that inevitably happens with this comedy romance.also having just turned 31 i can relate to these two guys getting older and not wanting to settle down, and it just seemed so real. and seeing Wilson as a loser? he's actually likable now and believe it I don't think he is the smarmy blonde-dude I used to think he used to come across as.the comedy was generally quite well acted, apart from the toilet joke, and other farcical stuff- seems like a senile granny cracking one-liners will crease an audience no matter what decade we are in, the ad-libbed lines were pretty good and the only complaint i may have is that the film is a *little* long-winded. but all in all, 7 out of 10. nice and effortless. great comedy duos - get them while we still have something to laugh about in this increasingly unfunny world.

It has its moments,"Wedding Crashers is a movie that has some fine parts but in the end those parts don't quite add up to form a satisfying whole. This is a film in which the whole is somehow less than the sum of its parts. The plot is straightforward and simple as can be, with Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson playing two guys who crash weddings to pick up women. That's the entire plot and it seems that the writers figured they could just set up that premise and much hilarity would then ensue. Unfortunately only intermittent hilarity ensues. When it's good, Wedding Crashers is very good but the comic energy is never really sustained. There are far too many scenes where nothing, certainly nothing very funny, happens.As Jeremy and John respectively Vaughn and Wilson are pretty much what you would expect them to be. Vaughn's the fast-talking yapper, Wilson much more relaxed. Each fills their respective role well. The movie takes off, or at least is meant to, when Wilson's John falls for Claire Cleary, the beautiful daughter of the Treasury Secretary, at Claire's sister's wedding. Meanwhile yet another Cleary sister, Gloria, clings to Vaughn's quite reluctant Jeremy. Our two crashers find themselves invited back to the Cleary family compound where John will continue to woo Claire, conveniently ignoring the fact she is about to be engaged to a raving lunatic, while Jeremy tries to wriggle free of the just a little bit crazy Gloria. Plenty of potential for comic gold it would seem but it never all comes together.Part of the problem is that the object of John's affection, Claire as played by Rachel McAdams, is impossibly dull and almost completely devoid of any personality. Almost nothing funny happens when McAdams is on the screen. Undeniably attractive but utterly boring, it's hard to see why John would instantly fall for this woman he doesn't even know. There's nothing remarkable about her. Probably not McAdams' fault, I'm sure she has a personality but her character surely doesn't. By contrast Gloria, as played by Isla Fisher, absolutely oozes personality and the movie comes to life every time Fisher is on the screen. Fisher repeatedly steals scenes from that noted scene-stealer himself Vince Vaughn. Her all-too-brief appearances are the highlights of the film. Unfortunately we spend much more time with the rather dull by comparison Wilson/McAdams would-be romance. Also notable, and not in a good way, is Bradley Cooper playing Claire's ridiculously over-the-top evil fiancée Sack. He's so bad you cringe every time he's on the screen. Comedies are not generally meant to induce cringing. And Christopher Walken as Treasury Secretary Cleary, the head of this rather bizarre family, is woefully underused. It's obvious he could have added a great deal to the movie if given the opportunity but instead we are stuck with the boring Claire, the obnoxious Sack and a host of other characters who add next to nothing. With some terrific actors in the cast, a surprising standout performance from Fisher and some real moments of comic genius along the way you get the sense Wedding Cashers could have been something truly great. Instead it's just OK and will leave you wanting more and wondering what could have been.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Slightly overrated perhaps, but it still passes as a raunchy romantic comedy","This R-rated romantic comedy, starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, was a big hit at the box office in 2005, but it didn't really catch my attention until early 2006, when it was highly recommended to me. By then, I had missed the opportunity to go and see it on the big screen, but it wasn't long before I rented a copy on DVD, simply because of the recommendation. I guess I was fairly impressed with it, even though I can't remember that first viewing very well, and couldn't think of any memorably hilarious moments. Over three years later, I've finally seen it again. Because of its popularity, I had reasonable expectations, and while I still may not completely understand the huge heaps of praise it has received, I think it was better for me with my second viewing, as it was funnier and more memorable.John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey are two lifelong friends, both single and working together as divorce mediators. They have a hobby of crashing weddings, and have a set of rules to follow for it. They get into the weddings under false identities, claiming to be related to the newlyweds. After they get in, both of them manage to attract vulnerable bridesmaids and get into bed with them just for one night. They never seem to fail! However, things don't go according to plan when John and Jeremy go to crash the wedding of Christina Cleary, the daughter of Secretary William Cleary. At this wedding the two friends set their sights on Claire and Gloria Cleary, two other daughters of William, but John actually falls in love with Claire! Jeremy makes out on the beach with Gloria, who turns out to be a sex-obsessed psychopath! John and Jeremy end up breaking the rules of wedding crashing and going to the Cleary family's island mansion, but they obviously can't keep their true identities secret forever!The film is funny around the beginning, with our two main characters on the job as divorce mediators. I can't think of any super-lame gags, but the film may be a tad dull for a while. I think most of the film at least had me snickering, and some parts definitely made me laugh harder than that. Before they get to the island mansion, the funniest part MIGHT be John and Jeremy at a wedding, being caught swearing in church by people in front of them. I would say it improves when they get to the island mansion, as some really funny things happen here, such as Jeremy getting knocked down twice while playing football and saying he can't breathe, the scene with Jeremy and Gloria in the bathroom, Grandma Mary Cleary's insults, what Jeremy goes through when he's tied to the bed, etc. There's also a lot of very funny and often raunchy dialogue, and Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are good as the two main characters. Certain other cast members contribute to the humour, most notably Isla Fisher as the sex-crazed Gloria. Will Ferrell in the small role of Chazz Reinhold is also funny, if you like the comedian.This is another crude comedy, and there are parts many people could find offensive, such as Jeremy tied to the bed and raped. If that sounds revolting to you, ""Wedding Crashers"" is probably a film you should stay away from, though I get the feeling I'm making it sound a tad heavier than it actually is. To me, there aren't too many really low points in the film, but one that really stands out is John beaten up by Zachary ""Sack"" Lodge (Claire's fiancée) as Sack's thug friends hold the victim, which really seems misplaced in a movie like this. It looks more like a scene from a crime drama than a romantic comedy. However, that is only one small part of the film, and fortunately, the rest isn't like that. For the most part, this 2005 smash hit comedy is a good, raunchy, silly romp, and the humour wasn't the only thing that kept my interest. The romance isn't bad, either. So, while not for kids (I'm sure you know it is rated R), and not for adults who hate crude comedies, I can see why this film has appeal.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Being as how the entire PLOT of this movie concerns two guys who breeze through life on charm alone, attending weddings to which they are not invited, it's not hard to see why they got they got the leads. The movie is not hard to sit through but neither is it particularly memorable once it's all over. Personally, I would have liked to get a little more information on HOW these two con artists always manage to get a seat at the dinner tables? Do they forge place cards or what? It can't just be as simple as showing up in a suit and pretending to be related to someone who isn't there. Ah well, it's a comedy... we're not meant to be concerned about how realistic it all is. We're only meant to judge how *funny* it is. Unfortunately, one week later and I hard-pressed to come up with one memorably-funny line or gag from the flick. I'm sure I was smiling amiably throughout (did I mention how dang *charming* the two leads are?) but the hilarity I was expecting just did not occur. Christopher Walken plays a Kennedy-esquire politician but it's a nothing role and it doesn't have much of the old Walken zing to it.

"""We're not so young anymore . . . """,". . . Thus muses Owen Wilson to his pal Vince Vaughn in their new movie, *Wedding Crashers*. To which I say: Oh yeah? -- then act like it! But to expect maturity from the likes of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn would be pointless, considering that both of them have not exactly behaved like adults in any of their previous films. (Well O.K., Wilson was interesting in Wes Anderson's *Bottle Rocket*, and Vaughn had a pretty good part as a creepy step-dad in that Travolta vehicle from several years ago, but 1 out of, like, 20 for each actor is a lousy scorecard.)Let it be said at once that Generation X is aptly named. If Wilson and Vaughn are the best comedy-team my generation can come up with, then we rightly deserve to be nameless. These guys make one long for Martin and Lewis (this is not meant to be complimentary). I spent a good portion of the movie wondering about the state of Wilson's hair: what's up with that, anyway? Why does he persist in looking like a late-Seventies stoner in movie after movie after movie? Is it supposed to be his ""trademark"", or something? As for his pal Vaughn, he seems to be literally EATING in every scene of this film, and boy, it shows: this is one individual who is, to a painfully obvious degree, bloated with the corrupting amenities of easy living (i.e., the typical life of an undisciplined Hollywood star). He has become a fat oaf who turns in lazy, blubbery performances. Why is this guy a star, again? Was it that whole ""you're money"" thing?Screw these guys and their lousy films. I mean, really. (I was dragged to see *Wedding Crashers*; I certainly didn't seek it out.) What kills me is that I kept reading all these laudatory reviews -- from professional movie critics who are doubtless GenXers themselves -- about this movie's ""sharp, edgy wit"" before I actually saw the damned thing. This is merely a case of the tribe protecting its own. Hey look, if your idea of sharp, edgy wit includes the spectacle of Vince Vaughn getting yerked off under a dinner table, then you'll love *Wedding Crashers*. And you'll die laughing when Jane Seymour gets her vanilla-pudding-bags squeezed by Owen Wilson. If those bits don't it for you, perhaps the repugnant wisecracks about Eleanor Roosevelt's sexuality (!) will tickle your ribs. Wow, what a scream.And why wasn't I surprised to see A Certain Former SNL Alumnus make a boorish, unfunny cameo at the end of the movie? (Hint: he's the one who screams a lot, which, I am told, is supposed to be hilarious.) Look, people: it's time to declare a moratorium on the Wilson/Vaughn/Stiller/Ferrell/Rudd Nexus of Bad Comedy.

"When it's funny, it's real funny","his was the highest grossing comedy of 2005. It ain't bad. They have a little too much of the romance plot in the film, which is sappy and occasionally slows down the picture. There's also a way-too-long montage near the beginning where we see Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn crashing a bunch of weddings that should have been way funnier. Coming so early in the movie, it had me a little worried. But, when it gets going, it is often laugh-out-loud funny. I always knew that Vince Vaughn had some real comedic talent. He's always fairly amusing in any comedy he's in, but I've never seen a movie where the material was really up to his abilities. Here, he gets most of the best material. That's almost disappointing just for the fact that he's co-starring with Owen Wilson and Christopher Walken (the latter sits on the sidelines through almost all the movie), but Vaughn manages always to keep the movie funny. Wilson, I think, is a very funny man, and he is often funny here. But he's the one stuck in the romantic plot of the film, and they don't let him be as funny as he ought to be. If the screenwriters had balanced things out a little, let both the stars work their stuff, this probably would have been the best comedy of the year. Isla Fisher is also pretty amusing as the crazy girl who falls for Vaughn. There's also an actor who appears in a cameo late in the picture who is simply hilarious, but I won't ruin that for anyone. Rachel McAdams, whom I think is the most beautiful woman alive right now, is sweet as the love interest, but, in that role, she has little to do.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Smashing!,"Wedding crashers, about two guys who invite themselves to weddings to hook up with women, is crude, filthy raunch. I loved it! There's nothing more beautiful and romantic than taking the maid of honor to bed during the reception. But I digress.Thanks in no small part to the excellent on-screen chemistry of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, the movie is a few notches above typical lowest-common-denominator fare. Oh, let's be honest - Pride and Prejudice, this ain't. But in its own idiom, Wedding Crashers is just plain good laugh out loud comedy.So this is what John (Wilson) and Jeremy (Vaughn) do. They get into their nice suits and crash weddings AND receptions. They cozy up to the hot guests, make balloon animals, dance, flirt, and eventually wind up with someone. And the next day or weekend, they do it again. Then one day John falls for his mark, Claire (Rachel McAdams), the daughter of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken). Oops; in violation of all of their rules of wedding crashing, the boys spend the weekend with the secretary and his upper-crust family. Claire's engaged to be engaged to Sack, who's thoroughly obnoxious and creepy. You know, just in case you thought she'd have to really choose between him and John, who's, well, Owen Wilson.Also thrown into the mix are Claire's younger sister Gloria, who has the hots for Jeremy - and who may or may not be a virgin; her brother Todd, a bitter, repressed artist; her mom, played by the usually prim Jane Seymour, who has the hots for Jeremy, too; a gramma, and a wise and all knowing butler. It's madcap mayhem, I tell you! Often, this type of chaotic, door-slamming comedy doesn't work in American films, but Wlson and Vaughn are talented enough to pull it off. And it helps that the movie is well written (by Steve Faber and Bob Fisher), with plenty of one liners and running gags.Sure, it's a tad predictable (gee, do you think true love will win?), but who cares? It's loads of fun, with some fantastically hysterical scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
So amusing !,"The opening is funny .Jeremy and John keep crashing weddings to sleep with a lot of women until John finds his true love . When he finds his true love, he does everything to get her . Beautiful romantic quotes .There was real fun - when they crash weddings and do all these sorts of repetitive conversations to get women , that was so funny . Good humour .What's really impressive is the jokes in this movie were pretty creative (like Dumb and Dumber To). Just looking at the people and their personalities made you laugh. Amazing soundtracks .Great acting by Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson.So hot erotic scenes , some were funny , some were steamy , some were funny and steamy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funniest thing I've seen in a long while,"Sometimes it's nice to see a good little art film that offers up a movie so unique, so true, that you wonder if cinema even existed before its conception. Other times, however, it's nice just to laugh your butt off and that's exactly what ""Wedding Crashers"" dishes up. Now I'm not saying that ""Wedding Crashers"" isn't unique, because, in reality, it is. It's unique in the fact that I can't remember a movie that made me laugh so long and so hard. In that regard, I think ""Wedding Crashers"" is actually one of the best films of the year because I truly feel it was one of the most entertaining. It's too bad that there aren't more films out there like this; that more films can't make me laugh until I cry, even on the second viewing. If you haven't yet seen this movie, then give it a chance and hopefully you'll laugh as much as I did because you probably deserve it. If not, and you think this film is terrible, then please don't hate me. I'm only trying to spread the joy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Hilarious frat pack comedy,"Given the level of success achieved by previous frat pack comedies like Old School, Dodgeball and Anchorman, it'd be easy to feel a little wary going into this film. Having provided us with so many comic moments that will surely be looked upon as classics in years to come, surely the time has come for Ben Stiller and his gang to deliver a dud amongst all the gems? Maybe it is, but 'Wedding Crashers' isn't it. In fact, this is one of the funniest offerings they've provided so far.Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn take their turns at centre stage as two divorce mediators with cynical views of marriage that crash weddings in a bid to seduce girls already half-hypnotised by the romantic air. And their first on screen pairing together is tremendous fun to say the least. Wilson, normally accustomed to playing the dumb surfer dude is here a more realistic character; a hardcore but also intelligent party crasher questioning whether this sort of behaviour is befitting of someone his age. Watching his attempts to get together with Rachel MacAdams, a senator's daughter he has fallen in love with, he becomes hugely sympathetic despite his incredibly immature, roguish actions during the first thirty minutes.Vaughn meanwhile is perfectly cast as Wilson's comic foil. His character is almost the exact opposite of the one he played in Dodgeball, the easy-going underdog charm replaced by a manic, motormouth lady killer. He spits out one liners so quickly, his rants on various aspects of relationships become increasingly difficult to keep up with and before you know it, you've missed many great lines simply because you're still laughing so hard at the other ones. Individually, the pair are both great actors, but together they provide a natural chemistry not unlike that of Laurel & Hardy, Wilson's laid back everyman charm perfectly offsetting Vaughn's misogynist arrogance.The support from the rest of the cast has much to commend as well. Rachel MacAdams as Wilson's love interest is, to put it in it's most basic terms, stunning. She couldn't have put in a better performance as the senator's daughter and it's easy to see how Wilson could fall for her so easily. She is both intelligent, world wise and incredibly pretty as well, with the sort of smile that could light up a room.Isla Fisher on the other hand offsets MacAdams much in the same way Vaughn offsets Wilson, the former Home And Away actress playing the demented younger sister that develops a crush on Vaughn and refuses to let go. She is at turns innocent and sweet, then deranged and perverse, yet handles all aspects of her character with ease and steals several scenes right out from under the other actor's noses. You have to give Fisher her dues that such an unrealistic persona could not only be entirely believable in her hands, but also very sympathetic and incredibly funny as well.That isn't to say this film is perfect though. Christopher Walken remains an imposing presence, but never actually gets to do anything, despite early hints that he will clash with Vaughn in much the same way Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller collided in Meet The Parents. Plus, there is a third act cameo from Will Ferrell which promises much but delivers little, squeezing surprisingly few laughs out despite Ferrell's proved comic abilities.Nevertheless, these are minor complaints in what is otherwise a riotously enjoyable comedy. There are no scenes as inherently stupid as Anchorman's newsreader gang war or Dodgeball's S&M uniform match, but the comic set pieces still deliver the goods and then some. One scene involving Vince Vaughn tied to a four poster bed and a potential homosexual rape from the senator's gay son is hysterically funny, whereas a football match in the first half is classic frat pack comedy. Despite the rapid succession of set pieces piled on top of each other though, there is still time for character development as well, Wilson and Vaughn's characters maturing as the film goes on and the end result is not only the most human comedy the frat pack have delivered thus far, but also one of the funniest as well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Still Laugh Out Loud Funny,"10 years after the release of this movie, it still has several laugh out loud moments and it is still a lot of fun.Plot In A Paragraph: John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) are best friends who spend their time crashing weddings they are not invited to, to pick up women. Trouble arises when they attend the wedding of the daughter of Senator Clearey (the always brilliant Christopher Walken) and John falls for bridesmaid Claire (Rachel McAdams) and Jeremy gets Sybil with an obsessed clingy bridesmaid Gloria (Isla Fisher)Wilson and Vaughn share a great easy chemistry, which enjoys some easy natural banter. They make the movie what it is!! Isla Fisher and Rachel McAdams are both good and Bradley Cooper (so usually the charming good guy) is surprisingly good as the douche boyfriend of McAdams. Jane Seymour still looks great, and is a lot of fun (although under used) as McAdams promiscuous mother. There is a fun cameo appearance and Keir O Donnell steals every scene he is in!!It is a little over long and it turns in to a typical Rom Com in the final act, but it doesn't stop the enjoyment of it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Pretty Good Movie,"Rating: 7.5
Overall, a fun movie to watch that is filled with many memorable quotes and good laughs, but what holds the movie back is it reeking of the 00s Rom-Com archetype with its predictable story and constant cliches, so it would probably be a fun movie to watch in the background or picking it up in the middle on TV.Pretty Good Direction, Pretty Good Acting (Good from Owen Wilson (While there was nothing spectacular about their performances, the chemistry the two leads have is incredible to where it helps propel the story and the jokes forward), Good from Vince Vaughn (See Owen Wilson), Pretty Good to Good from Christopher Walken, Pretty Good to Good from Bradley Cooper, Great from Will Ferrell (even though it is a cameo and it is a bit over-the-top, his scene is one of the most memorable ones of the movie cause of how much command he has and how funny it is), Decent to Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Decent Story (the story is incredibly predictable and cliche as it is one of the prime examples of 00s Rom-Coms), Pretty Good to Good Screenplay (pretty simple in the dialogue/symbolism, but the jokes are pretty funny throughout the movie and keep you interested), Pretty Good to Good Score, Pretty Good Cinematography, Pretty Good Sound, Pretty Good Editing, Plot Structure was fine for the most part (but I think it should spend a bit more time in the 10 minutes before the climax because the audience is just kinda thrown into Vaughn and Fisher's characters getting married (cause no passage of time is really given, just that they are 'moving quickly')), Build to the climax was decent (while it does have the best moment of the movie (Chazz scene), it really does not go that well into the fallout between Wilson and Vaughn's characters and the latter's relationship (maybe like 10 minutes cut from the middle to put into that would have helped)); the climax is pretty cliche but not bad overall (its a 00s rom-com after all)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Entertaining, But Then It Crashes Toward the End","Wedding Crashers...a very funny film that just could have been better. I'm not a big comedy fan. I only saw this because I was able to see it for free. It has two good and pretty funny actors in it, and I will say they did very well together. The story of two guys crashing weddings for the free food, drinks, and girls--one of them ends up falling for a political figure's daughter and the other strangely falls for the sister. This seems like a pretty good story for a romantic comedy. And it is for a while. The whole movie provides the audience with laughter, which of course was a very good thing. It was the relieving factor here. I just did not like how I did not care about what happened to any of the characters, especially during the middle half. They made pretty messed up decisions and I was beginning to get tired. But I'm sure not many people are going to care about that. This is a comedy, not a drama. It is supposed to be fun and it is. I guess it just becomes a little too drab, and I just did not care how it finished. A lot of you will like this though. The movie is entertaining for a while, but as I said before, it then crashes toward the end. And if you are concerned with sexual content, there is plenty of it mainly in the dialogue and brief nudity. That is about it. If you are a fan of comedies or any of the actors, you will have a good time with these crashers =)6.2/10 Stars",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Very funny,"Yes... it was a very funny movie. At times I could forget problems and just laugh. Owen Wilson was great and Vaughn found his target. I hated him for a lot of years after his sacrilegious interpretation of Norman Bates, but now I can understand. He was born for comedies. He is one of that comedians like Buster... they make you laugh but looks always angry. I'm not going to stop in details like script mistakes. Perhaps my congratulations to the edition work... but I think that this movie wasn't made to analyze, it was made just to enjoy and everybody in the cinema did it. I didn't see anybody after the movie without a smile and that is enough to say that is a good work.... sorry director... congratulations too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Pretty Good Modern Comedy,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was very funny, and well directed. The plot was basically mediocre fare, but the acting raised it to another level. I suspect that Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson improvised a lot of their dialog, which made it pretty original and truly hilarious. That just shows you that good acting can take a mildly funny Saturday-Night-Live-type plot, and turn it into a very entertaining movie. I would almost go and see any Vaughn/Wilson pairing after this. The directing and editing also enriched the film, for example, the opening montage of all the different weddings they crash was filled with a genuine insouciance that made you feel like going to a wedding. In fact, I have always thought of weddings as pretty boring, but they gave me a new opinion! It was exciting to watching them have all the fun they were having. The romance aspect between Wilson and the girl was the most boring partcan't anyone write a FUNNY young female ingénue?! It's not the fault of the actress, it's the writing. Blah. ""I'm pretty, sweet, young, and confused."" Blah, blah, blah. That's what I mean about the mediocre plot. But the chemistry and dialog of Vaughn and Wilson really make up for that!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Just a few steps behind a Mel Brooks film,"OK, maybe I overexaggerated on the title of the review by comparing it to the master himself, but it was waaaaaay above the typical romantic comedy made in the last few years, maybe the whole decade. I actually have to disagree with the other reviews which said that the movie hangs strong mostly because of the actors. This is among the most witty-written simple comedy I've ever seen. The setup is rather typical, though the main idea is relatively new; at least it hasn't been copied too many times, and none that I can think of. This is also one of the few films, if not the only one, where Christopher Walkens was cast, but as brilliant as he is, his talent wasn't as put to the test as much as usual, and the movie does not live because of it, but because of the excellent plot. He just makes the great lines sound exactly as they should sound, which is what he's good at. The two main characters are great. And some of the lines seemed to be written with a thought of how they would sound with those particular actors, I believe. Last but now least, this is a rare comedy for the corny parts actually feel solid and relatable (for lack of better word). As much as directors love to overdo the romance and the music and crying that goes with it, this director kept it with only the necessary elements; no extra emotions. Never thought such a simple comedy could get me so plugged into it. But it did. So, watch it! Never know when the next decent romance will come. :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Cute movie,"I really enjoyed watching wedding crashers. The movie is light, Olwen Wilson is as usual successful in his part...Yet, i think that there are lots of scenes that have been repeated over and over in the movies...Pouring a laxative in someone's drink in order to ""annoy him and get him out of the way in the rude competition to claim the princess's heart..."". Funny, but classy.Wedding crashers is the kind of movies you'd enjoy watching if you're really bored, tired, angry, or just need something to ease you down. I'd recommend it in this respect. In a general way, it's a very good movie. The title is very well placed. But i wouldn't personally rank it among the ""best in years"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funnier than expected,"I saw this movie with low expectations considering the comedies of the summer. However I was pleasantly surprised! Definitely the best comedy of the summer! Vince Vahn really hits it this time playing the man behind Owen Wilson. While Owen's part has a lot of hysterical lines, Vince really steals the show. I missed a couple of lines because I was laughing so hard. Its on my ""to buy"" list of movies. Rachel McAdams is pretty good in this movie too. Ofter ""the girl"" of the movie can ruin the comedy in a movie but that is not the case here. Go and see this movie while you still can and join in your friends as they joke about this movie!

"Watchable, if over-hyped","One of the most unnerving things about ""Wedding Crashers"" is that the two leads are just as sleazy and despicable as the film's villain, but we're suddenly supposed to sympathize with them because they've found girls they like. What these two need is comeuppance...but leave that to a darker comedy, I guess. So try to forget about that while you're watching it.John (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) crash weddings to meet, seduce and dump girls. They've got it worked out to a system, which is humorous because it's believable. But John is having second thoughts about their irresponsible, even hurtful lifestyle. Then at a wedding they meet the Cleary sisters (Rachel McAdams and Isla Fisher) and fall for them. The two sisters are immediately accepting of them, and invite them out to their rich father's summer cottage.The father is played by Christopher Walken, and it's probably the first time in this guy's career that he's been underused. Who the hell under-uses Christopher Walken? He's there to be overused! The strange thing is that it's clear the filmmakers know how to be funny...there are many funny moments, and Vince Vaughn is hilarious. But there are so many gaps between the really good jokes, and the writer gets lazy when he resorts to the phoned-in gay and T&A jokes. And lots of great comedic opportunities are missed, as when Walken walks in on Vaughn after he's been tied to the bed by Walken's horny daughter. This could've been the funniest scene in the movie, but instead, nothing happens.Vince Vaughn is probably the movie's biggest success. He manages to do what Jack Lemmon did in ""Some Like it Hot"": to create a believable, funny character and also establish a personality for himself for movies to come. The performance is not as memorable as Lemmon's, because the movie isn't as memorable (not by a mile), but Lemmon's got an Oscar nod, and I do think Vaughn deserves some consideration.The movie's lack of morals hurt it as well. John and Jeremy never feel even slightly sorry for their deeds, and hypocritically exploit the wrongs of Claire's silly evil fiancé Sack. Characters as dark as these are only really funny in movies with some sort of moral message or point, the message here seems to be ""do what you want, worry only about yourself"". But I guess it seems to be the general agreement these days that a movie with morals can't be funny.The movie's sleazy, terribly uneven, and almost like a collection of missed opportunities, with a great performance from Vaughn and funny parts here and there.6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

OK if highly predictable romantic comedy,"Owen Wislon and Vince Vaughn, who is an acquired taste, star as ""The Wedding Crashers."" When they aren't working, they crash weddings, intent on eating, drinking and having one-night stands. Simple as that. The predictable plot has Wilson falling hard for a gal (Rachel McAdams of ""The Notebook"" ) at one of the weddings they crash. Unfortunately, she has a serious boyfriend who beats up on Wilson. But Wilson will not be deterred, much to the dismay of Vaughn, who crashes weddings strictly for the reasons cited above and nothing more. Christopher Walken plays the father of McAdams, and he seems out of his element in what is essentially the DeNiro role from ""Meet the Parents."" Vaughn is as usual too much and should be taken outside and shot. Come to think of it, that's exactly what happens to him here. Wilson is funny and endearing as a lovelorn sap who fears he may never win his true love. McAdams, sporting very dark hair, is sweet and affecting as his true love. Her character would have been played by someone like Cameron Diaz 10 years ago. Come to think of it, Diaz did play the same type of role, in 1997's ""My Best Friend's Wedding."" The ending is exactly what you are thinking it is as you read this. The movie holds few surprises, but it makes an OK time killer.

"Stupid, but, thankfully, a fun side of stupid.","For every dirty sex joke and every dirty does of crude crass humor, there is the potential for a laugh, there are laughs, and then there is fun. It's a simple premise, with an even simpler execution. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson crash weddings and get laid, get involved with a rich family, they both sort of fall in love with two daughters of said family, and potentially do sole searching.What made this one work is the goofy nature of its comedy. All of the humor styles I hinted at are executed with the pure persoona, with pure energy. Both of the leads are fun to watch. Their system for crashing weddings, while a bit of a stretch, is so committed, you can't help but go along with it. The Bradley Copper character is so unlikeable and irritating every time he is on screen, yet he is played to such a delightfully slimy t I have to give credit.Everyone's putting forward effort here, to make us laugh, and while this is hardly a cackling till you tear up kind of affair I had fun with it.

Crashes and burns,"Decent cast, good word-of-mouth and a no-beating-about-the-bush beginning, this was shaping up to be an amusing ride. It wasn't.

If Christopher Walken can't liven up your movie, nobody can.I like Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn even more, yet surely they can spot a duff script between them? For a comedy with an ostensibly good heart, it spices up a worrying number of its jokes with swearing. Profanity is my middle name, but even I know what's f****** funny and what isn't.And when will people realise that Will Ferrell isn't as funny as he thinks he is? Elf showed that he does have talent but increasingly he relies on self-conscious mugging and overplayed idiocy.

Chazz is the icing on the wedding cake!,"Steve Faber and Bob Fisher have written a real gem with the Crashers! Jeremy and John are hitting you with the laughs at a 100 miles an hour! Jeremy and girlfriend Gloria are sensational. One minor complaint would be that the movie has a slow last third. The movie could have been shorter. They would have done better with more editing. Walken was his stereotypical self. Enter Chazz Reinhold, and the movie lifts another notch again. I left the theater laughing over an over at Chazz's quotes....he is sensational. This would be close to the best yet of this Vaughn, Wilson, Stiller, Ferrell comedy genre. It will certainly appeal to the wider audience. Women will rate this movie well.

"Up And Downs, Smiles And Frowns","I went to see wedding crashers not expecting a whole lot from it I thought it looked like another random dime a dozen comedy. BUT, this film is extremely funny although some people may find it a little over the top...cringe worthy...I came out feeling very happy to have seen it, talking to my friend about it constantly for about a day, quoting little snippets, but when i think back some of the humour was to say the least a little poor in places but this did not spoil the film. If i had to be honest I loved most of the film, especially with Will Ferrel popping up in the film.WATCH THIS FILM! you just wont want to go out and buy it afterwards its just too much of the same all the way through.

A must see comedy!!!,"I just saw a sneak preview of Wedding Crashers. I really enjoyed this movie. This is the perfect role for Vince Vaughn. I laughed till it hurt and the whole audience was cracking up. I'll have to see it again so I can hear what I was laughing through. I don't want to give anything away but it had some great surprises. Most movies of this type always seem like they don't know how to end it, but Steve Faber and Bob Fisher finally got it right. So go rush out and see it on opening weekend so you won't have the ending spoiled for you.Great, great comedy!!!A must see Summer Comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The woke are missing the point (as usual),"Seeing the woke mob (who were probably barely born when this film came out) chastising it for its portrayal of the two lead characters living their seemingly fun, single lives, that is mainly bedding women and having a great time, really didn't understand the point of the film. Yes, there are many laughs along the way, and as a guy it seems like they're having a lot of fun, but if they finished the film, which many don't even bother to do before running to the internet to cry, you'd see that their whole lifestyle was fun at times but mainly depressing and empty until they met the right person and realised that said former lifestyle was a sad, empty existence. That's how films work 'woke kids'. Characters journey through the film and get to the end and they are changed for their experience. Not everything has to be plain sailing and nobody but you cares that you were offended by what you saw.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funniest film for years! MOTOR-BOAT!,"So far it has been a very productive and enjoyable year in the movie world and with the big comedy movie of the summer having arrived, yet again audiences won't be disappointed. This is a comedy dream team-up here with Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. The two have been regulars in the Ben Stiller posse and this time these two titans share the screen. Of all the team-ups you could imagine from the Wilson's, Vaughn. Stiller, Ferrell and Black, the Wedding Crashers has perhaps the most interesting and indeed the two spark off each other superbly.Crashers is a very funny movie. In fact it is riotous at times. I have not laughed as hard as I did watching this at the cinema before. I was crying I tell you, crying in a theatre full of witnesses, and everyone else was crying with me, crying with uncontrollable laughter. This is a good solid R-rated movie and in good old England my home a very adult 15 certificate and it really pushes that rating very close to a full 18 certificate, and in fact I am shocked this film wasn't rated 18. This film really pushes the limits of taste, but does so superbly. This features perhaps the best dining room scene ever, the funniest rape scene ever, and the funniest motor-boat impression ever. Why is the film funny? It just is. It's down to great comical performances and outrageous situations.The story revolves around two wedding crashers who crash weddings in order to get laid. They have been doing so for years, however John (Wilson) is getting tired and questioning whether or not they should be doing it at their age. Vaughn insists they should live a little while they are still young however Wilson points out that they are not that young anymore. Of course the two still crash weddings and set about hitting the mother-load at the wedding of the year. At the wedding Wilson meets and becomes infatuated with Claire (Rachel MacAdems) while Vaughn sees her younger sister, Gloria (Isla Fisher) but merely as a notch on his belt. Of course the Wilson plot-line is your typical rom-com plot-line where two people meet, begin to fall for each other, but on the pretence of a lie, which later comes out and threatens to wreck any hope of the inevitable happy ending. This is your atypical rom-com stuff but thankfully doesn't become too perfunctory, keeping the laughs on a high, even at the climax of the film, when a lot of staple rom-com scenes play out. However most of the films big laughs involve Vaughn's plot line where he gets more than he bargained for with Fisher who turns out to be a psychotic and clingy nymphomaniac.The cast are great. Wilson is as laid back and easy going as ever, while MacAdems is just adorable. However Vince Vaughn is a one man show. Vaughn is absolutely top class here, on fire. Isla Fisher is just superb as the deranged sister and she and Vaughn have some of the funniest scenes I have seen in ages. There is also good support from Christopher Walken and a rather hot Jane Seymour (Milf!) as his wife, who keeps trying to seduce Wilson to hilarious effect. Elsewhere Will Ferrell turns up for a funny cameo as a guy who crashes funerals.Overall this film is pure hilarity. A great comedy with great scenes. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funniest movie of the year,"Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson...What more do you want? The movie revolves around two divorce mediators named John Beckwith(Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Klein(Vince Vaughn), who crash weddings in their spare time for their own personal pleasures. They sweep women off their feet and into their beds using the funniest of gimmicks but using rules set by a man named Chaz. After many weddings with much success, they decide to hit the big one, Secretary of Treasury William Cleary's (Christopher Walken) daughters wedding. On arrival to the wedding, John notices Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams) who is a bridesmaid in the wedding. He quickly starts to work his magic on Claire while Jeremy is working his magic on another one of the three sisters. When John finds out that Claire has a jerk of a boyfriend, he decides not to quit and keep after her. Meanwhile, Jeremy is having sex with the other sister on the beach and finds out that she is a psychotic, clingy, virgin who is in love with Jeremy now.John and Jeremy are invited to the house for the weekend and John happily accepts whereas Jeremy wants to bail. Jeremy is forced into going with John to this quirky family's house where John and Jeremy find a very extremely wacky time with a deranged grandma, a gay brother, the psychotic sister, and the problem of keeping the secret that they aren't who they seem. The movie is the funniest movie since Old School and perhaps funnier. It is also a great romance movie for the girls as well (minding the large amount of sex and nudity). The acting is surprisingly very good and the movie is just all around entertaining.I highly recommend this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
bad all the way,"Perhaps this movie really does portend the end of civilization as we know it. The acting was terrible, the jokes refried, can it be that its good premise was enough to seduce the audience. Probably. It has all the earmarks of a pitch grown to hasty green light and a wild time had by the cast at the world's expense.Look at Walken for instance, I felt sorry for him, he should have known better, unless he just needs the money.It is symptomatic however of how low standards have fallen for comedy. And how easy it is to make people laugh. Having walked out on Meet The Fokkers after the first fifteen minutes, I can say that this is not quite as inane, but is equally unfunny.Thank goodness there is a minimum of ten lines here. I honestly can't think of anything good to say about this movie. What a bad summer for films so far, and this is keeping up that high standard. How about a zero out of ten. But alas, I have to give it a one, nothing lower.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Great lines, great delivery, great casting","Vaughn is the tops of this all-star casting for the funniest movie I have seen in at least two years. It barely slows down for even a minute as we laughed all the way to the finish. The only negative was the number of lines we missed because of the laughter in the theatre.The pairing of Vaughn and Wilson was perfect. Christopher Walken pulled off his role perfectly, and the rest of the cast - Jane Seymour, Rachel McAdams, Isla Fisher, Will Arnett, Henry Gibson, and Will Ferrell were great.This is a very funny movie, even if it does get a little risqué. There are some terrific lines that bring back a laugh when I think about them today.The scenes at the mansion and on the quail hunt are priceless.This is a must see for anyone who likes comedy. The only issue now is to find another vehicle for Vaughn and Wilson.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
You will see the nation's capital in a whole new light!!!!!,"CAUTION: May contain spoilers; however, I will do my best NOT to give away key points in the storyline.I laughed so much on this one until it hurt!! By far the best comedy/'buddy' movie of the summer, WEDDING CRASHERS lives up to its pre-release hype. It stars Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn as two long-time buddies who make it their hobby and mission in life  or rather, lifestyle  to crash weddings as a means of hitting on and 'bagging' beautiful single women; all this when they aren't at their day job mediating divorces.This formula has worked for them for a number of years by following a number of rules they have committed to memory and which they have flawlessly executed to perfection. Whether the wedding is Catholic, open-air, Jewish, Hindu or even the coup-de-grace, the wedding of one of the daughters of the Secretary of the Treasury (brilliantly played by Christopher Walken), these two buddies have the art of crashing weddings down to a science; only thing is, it is this last wedding where they get jammed up, or rather, hoisted up by their own petard.Both Wilson and Vaughn's characters endear themselves to the Treasury Secretary's family, and as a result of the friendliness that runs both ways, get themselves invited out to the family's island home on Maryland's Eastern Shore for a few days.(An example of the 'friendliness': Jane Seymour  who is playing in wicked and wanton form in this film as Walken's wife in a scene with Wilson where she is clearly coming on to him says: ""The Secretary and I have been married 30 years"". Wilson makes a complimentary remark. She continues, ""We've been faithful for two."")With the (psychotic) youngest daughter Gloria (played by Isla Fisher, who stole just about every scene she was in) and the deranged, sicko homosexual son 'Todd', who were BOTH white hot on the trail of Vaughn's character, and Wilson doing what he can to get past the mean-spirited control-freak 'boyfriend' of the other drop-dead gorgeous daughter (Rachel McAdams), the sparks fly all-around in one non-stop laugh after another, all coming down to a showdown in a wedding at the end involving one of the players that will leave your jaw hanging wide open.The only real complaints of note I had with this movie was way too much dropping of the 'f-bombs' when there was simply no need. This movie was genuinely funny without the need to drop them, and it would have still earned its R-rating. The gratuitous showing of quick flashes of female flesh had no artistic merit to it; the simple innuendo or suggestion of taking these girls to bed would have gone much further with moviegoers, as our imaginations are far more lurid than anything they could have come with. We could also have done without the one cameo towards the end of the film, as it added nothing noteworthy towards the movie.WEDDING CRASHERS is a definite MUST-SEE for serious movie-goers and the DVD will be well worth the purchase at Thanksgiving or Christmas time; HOWEVER, it is for GROWN-UPS only, and the R rating was given for good reason. DO NOT bring children to this movie under any circumstances as most of the jokes would fly over their heads. Let them wait until they are old enough to experience juvenile adulthood for themselves  that is, if they want to.On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this film an 'easy' 9! ***",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Citizen Kane, The Graduate, and Wedding Crashers.","For each of us who appreciate the AFI's 100 greatest films, there are those of us, myself included, that aren't afraid to show our love for the good 'ol character-driven, fish out of water, situational, buddy-buddy, flash a boob, sometimes-sophomoric, sometimes not, yet always flawless timing modern COMEDIES. That said, Wedding Crashers is a must... Not only to see, twice, but to get your friends to see, so that you can start doing what every Vince Vaughn and company vessel promises... The everlasting, Fletch-like ""when I can use this quote"" time of every day for the next six weeks. (Or if you hang out with my friends, six decades).The film is full of them. But it's not just a bunch of jokes. This film holds up a pretty solid storyline yet doesn't make the same mistake most comedies do when most lose the laughs after the first act. This one had people rolling so hard in the second and third that sometimes we actually missed large chunks of dialogue that was probably even funnier than the ones we were still laughing about. The writing steered away (literally in the case of Owen's character NOT wrecking the yacht)from the ""easy"" joke choices and instead found the nooks and crannies to hide some of the best tricks in the book.Delivery. Owen Wilson makes it looks effortless and fun. He always does. Same with Vince Vaughn.... Although always funny when he is the cocky fun-loving party guy, he is at his best when his character is frustrated, and his delivery of simple dialogue is so creative that I don't know who was going to blow a gasket, him or me. I honestly busted out laughing in the theater more than once. And that's a rarity these days. And Rachel? Rachel has a quality about her that makes you love her before she even said her first line. It's tough to stand out around this cast and she does so, very brightly. And what's not to love about Walken. He's the king of delivery. And the rest of the cast is right along with them every step of the way to round out the funniest movie I've seen this year.I love the great dramatic pieces like everybody does. But let's not mix apples with grenades here. This movie may not win an Oscar for best picture, but it definitely earns respect as a solid, fun experience with a moral that doesn't beat you over the head. I believe it was GQ who tagged these comics (and the revolving crew of guys) as the modern-day Rat Pack... So enjoy it while it lasts.

"The worst, absolutely the worst","This film is a waste of time and it amounts to little more than a giant opportunity to maliciously ridicule gays.

They did it right.,Here it is. The best summer comedy of the year.

The best part of this movie is that under the the funniness there is a really good story.

Wedding Crashers review,"Wedding Crashers was one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I enjoyed it so much, that I actually took two different people and saw it twice. It combines slapstick humor with an interesting plot, and meaningful life issues, like love, friendship, and power. I throughly enjoyed it, and would recommend it to anyone. Some of the scenes were downright hilarious. I know it has done well at the box office, and continues to deserve to do so.

Apparently Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn improvised most of the scenes. Pure genius. The chick from Mean Girls did an amazing job, too.

A very funny film with some great performances,I usually like to catch matinées but even nowadays its filled with weirdos. I went this morning to see Wedding Crashers and there is this guy in there - he must of been mentally challenged - at least i hope so - the WHOLE film he was HOWLING and then GRUNTING and then telling people to SHHH! when they laughed - I can't win!Despite the distractions (and fear of being stabbed in the back by some Psycho) I was able to enjoy most of the movie. It's feel was like Meet The Fockers except way more raunchier and didn't involve animals biting people's private parts - thank goodness.The whole cast was good and delivered some funny scenes that I hadn't expected.

Non-stop laughs,"This movie is one of the funniest I have seen in a long time. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are absolutely awesome together. You probably won't see this movie up for any Acadamy Awards, but you also probably won't see an actor perform better in a comedy than Vince Vaughn. He delivers his lines flawlessly and and really develops his character perfectly. Owen Wilson is a perfect complement and the rest of the cast does an awesome job as well. The movie is about 2 guys who crash weddings. They treat Wedding Season like an athlete would treat football season. They crash weddings to meet girls and have one-night stands without commitment. But forget about the plot because this movie is really about being hilarious. There is, of course, the obligatory love story and the ending is definitely satisfying, but by the time the ending gets there, you really won't care how it ends because you will have spent the previous 2 hours laughing so hard.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The role of Vince Vaughn's career,"Over the last 5 years or so, I've gone back and forth in my opinion of Vince Vaughn. My opinion of his characters in Zoolander and Old School was lukewarm, and Psycho was just AWFULLY CREEPY. But this is the role he was BORN to play! He and Owen Wilson are consistently funny from start to finish. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD. There's a lot to be said about a movie in which Christopher Walken's character is the most normal one of the whole cast. That's a little frightening! No one in this movie is perfect; in fact, almost all of the characters have varying degrees of dysfunction. But they are lovable and dynamic and overall, believable. It was a little upsetting that Vaughn and Wilson are both in their late thirties, courting women who appear to be in their early twenties, but sometimes you have to just look the other way and let it be funny for funny's sake.

Wilson and Vaughn are the new Laurel and Hardy, they really make you laugh. the banter and chemistry between these guys are spot on. They deliver the laughs with utmost precision and when you least expect it they deliver again.There are some romantic interludes, but that doesn't detract from the overall package. Isla fisher is a revelation as one of the senator's daughter's and Jane Seymour shows off her as yet untapped comedic talents.All in all a great comedy, I'll be buying it on DVD to watch it time and again when in need of a good laugh.Go and see this film, you will not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Crash Course in Fun!,"A bit long perhaps, but still loads of entertainment. Very well cast, with Jane Seymour in a surprise role, and other surprises.

Let's just say that had the film been entirely, 100% excellent, I would have been able to ignore my sore rump!

Hilarious!,"Wedding Crashers is better than the trailer shows it out to be, make you laugh quite a few times until the ending, but it stays less than superb.2 career-successful bachelors have a habit of crashing in at weddings with fake identities to exploit the romantic mood of the best ladies and get lucky all season long. This recurs until one of them .... you know, falls into a marsh called love. The other gets stuck by a psychotic possessive nymph and both of them see their lives taking turn altogether while attending the US Treasury Secretary's daughter's wedding.75% of the movie holds the humor well with occasional wisecracks and screw-ups. 25% was the sentimental part, which, oh well, had to be there if a guy has to convince his girlfriend to come watch the movie with him and not get beaten up badly later on.Vince Vaughn has finally hit it well with his comic talent. I did mention in a previous comment for Mr & Mrs. Smith than Vaughn should consider serious movies for better recognition, and still stand by that, but this movie will definitely boost up his value among casting directors at Hollywood. Vaughn can still play a sarcastic-fast talking lead in a serious movie. He definitely is no Harrison Ford but he can build a class of his own.Owen Wilson, on the other hand, did an OK job. It was his character who fell in love in the movie and started changing the flow of the story around, but in my opinion could not match up with Vaughn's comic acting. I'll praise Wilson because he did ""try."" However, seeing Rachel McAdams in this movie has motivated me to watch another movie which I was actually least inclined to check out - the Notebook. The first time I saw McAdams on the big screen, like many may have, was a spoiled dirty blonde teenager in the Rob Schneider comedy ""The Hot Chick."" Thereafter she has starred in the Notebook and Mean Girls, won critical acclaim for her performance in the former and has won a role in the upcoming thriller ""Red Eye."" Not only is she pretty as a brunette, but also shows natural acting talents and ability to portray simplicity well.Supporting cast by Christopher Walken and Will Ferrell (yes, he had to be there) was a well done job, and same's with the lesser known, yet very attractive ladies who played un-named bridesmaids throughout the movie.Do watch the movie if you like comedy. Leave your brains and logical thinking aside for the 2 hours you will dedicate to this movie (and your companion if applicable). There are loose ends towards the end, and thats when you start waiting for the movie to finish. But until the loose-ends, you will enjoy the movie and laugh out loud!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I was very disappointed.,"So these two sex-crazy guys decide to crash weddings. They get laid a lot, really easily, and keep doing it. (Pun intended.) So eventually one of them actually falls in love with a girl, and meanwhile a nutcase harasses his best buddy. Cue some crude sex gags, a couple of cameos and all the other obvious stuff. The result? Wedding Crashers, a disappointingly average comedy starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn.The movie's plot isn't strong to begin with, but it is taken to an insultingly simplistic level in less than thirty minutes. Once the beginning wears off, the movie gets stuck in a rut  it turns into a film less about crashing weddings, and more about trying to survive in a wacko's house for a few days without being sexually molested. (Nope, it's not a Michael Jackson biography.) Example? In one scene, a woman molests Vaughn's character, then  while still strapped to a bed, unable to free himself  another character who's supposed to be gay begins to kiss him and proceeds to try and seduce him.It's funny at first, but the whole gag is stretched far too long  once we understand that the girl is a psycho and the kid is gay, it's only funny for so long.Meanwhile Christopher Walken (who plays a wealthy politician) is pushed to the background, his character unconvincing, unfunny and unreasonable. Although the role is similar to that of De Niro's in ""Meet the Parents,"" it's so underwritten and neglected that Walken really just comes across as another vacant face.Vaughn and Wilson have good chemistry (which we already knew, really) and they alone make Wedding Crashers suitable entertainment. As a way of passing ninety lazy minutes, it's adequate fluff. But it could have been better  a lot better. The humor could have been funnier, raunchier, and more daring. The plot could have used less clichés and more spice. Walken and many other characters could have been filled out to their full comedic potential.In the end, the movie is disappointing because it achieves so little. It's one of those films where you're already forgetting it on the way out of the theater. I was hoping I'd at least remember it back to the hotel room.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Well worth seeing in theaters,"I saw the Wedding Crashers with the same expectations of Old School and Anchorman. I'm glad my expectations were surpassed.I loved this movie. Although I'm not a huge fan of the ""frat-pack"" movies, I still liked Anchorman - and thought Wedding Crashers even surpassed that one.The performances, although very funny, are taken seriously. It won't have you laughing every other minute, but at least it isn't filled with boring periods of time often found in others of the genre. If you liked Meet The Parents, more than likely you'll like this one too.One thing I'll add to this review is that the ten lines minimum rule is too long, I've said what I wanted to say.

Non stop laughs,"This movie was fantastic. I can not remember the last time a movie made me laugh so hard, so loud, so often. The only downside was that there were so many great lines it was hard to hear funny line after funny line because the whole theater was laughing so hard. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson had amazing chemistry, they are both hysterical in the film, Vaughn especially. But the movie would not have been complete without the flawless performances of the supporting cast. Chris Walken is always amazing, and Isla Fischer stole every scene. Comic curve balls are constantly being thrown and the laughs just keep coming. This movie was just fantastic. It is a great date movie. Guys and girls can enjoy the humor. There is also plenty of guy humor, and there is the romance aspect for the girls. It is a win win for everyone. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good time and for anyone willing to laugh their ass off. Go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Great Idea, Great Actors, Formulaic Hollywood Movie","What a hilarious idea!! Guys who crash weddings to get laid! The stories they have to make up to get the women! The Rules created by their mentor that they follow by the number! The montage in the beginning is So funny and SO energetic that the movie basically shoots its wad within the first 15 minutes. Then it becomes a mainstream love story with Owen Wilson as his usual casually corny self and an admittedly adorable Rachel McAdams (this girl is going places since her twin, Jennifer Garner is out of commission). Isla Fisher, the wacky sister is absolutely amazing. She was also in ""the Swimming Pool"" for you movie hounds. The writing is so mainstream and so pedestrian that I am left fantasizing about all the missed opportunities - which creative types could conjure simply from reading the 100 rules of crashing a wedding. Christopher Walken's serious Dad here has a hint of humor behind his eyes which is so fun to watch. But then his role is smooshed down with the rest of the mainstream Hollywood movie ending. Corny, formulaic; you see the next scene around just about every corner and laugh only because the actors are so good. I gave this a bad rating because I'm surprised that this movie has such high votes.It's funny but could have been so much better if it went the ""indie"" route and not the 'hollywood' sidewalk.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funniest Movie of the Year,"Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn deliver in ""Wedding Crashers"". The plot is simple to follow. Wilson and Vaughn are divorce attorneys in Washington DC and during a period of time goes out and crash weddings. Their goal is to meet women and successfully sleep with them. Then the biggest crash opportunity comes when the Secetary of Treasury's, played by Christopher Walken, daughter gets married and then they meet the other two daughters. Wilson aims for the sweet beautiful daughter, played by Rachel McAdams, while Vaughn is in deep trouble after hooking with the other daughter. While trying to get out of his situation, Vaughn gets conned into going to the family beach house, so that Wilson can try to fall in love with McAdams.

An amazing film which all will enjoy,"Well I've gotta say this film really does have it all. The plot itself follows along a tried and tested classic, basically men playing women. However Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn provide a brilliant performance where you can believe the storyline of the characters. A big mention has to go to Christopher Walken who showed true acting class in this performance, and well played the stereotypical father in law amazingly well.This film is a must see, go see it with your mates, your girlfriend but probably not your parents. There are parts which will have you in hysterics as well as a deeper storyline which will appeal more to female viewers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Painfully contrived - embarrassingly unfunny,"I rented this movie and watched it at home. About 3/4 of the way through the movie, I realized that - having started off not too badly, this movie was getting worse and worse. I didn't even care enough about the characters or the plot to see it through to the end, so I turned it off.This movie progresses (ha! that's a laugh) from one embarrassingly painful scene to the next. When they got to the scene describing the process of seducing vulnerable women at funerals - one of the most un-funny scenes I've had the pleasure of viewing - I finally threw in the towel.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
laugh out loud funny,"This movie didn't surprise me, it just lived up to its trailer....it was laugh out loud funny.

We went for one of the sneak peaks and though a few friends were grumbling that they ""probably would be glad that they got to see it free"" they changed their tune about 10 minutes into it. My husband who usually is pretty quiet couldn't stop talking about his favorite parts, and when in the car he started smiling I asked what was so funny, he just shook his head and said ""all of it"" I would encourage everyone to see it, as a late thirty-something I give it a thumbs up!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funniest movie in a long time,"I know some people thought that Anchorman and Old School were great movies, but I think they are overrated (though still funny).I attended the sneak preview for Wedding Crashers Wednesday.

The last time I laughed this hard was the first time that I saw the original Meet the Parents in the theater. There were a couple of times I was literally in tears.It's hard to go wrong with Vince OR Owen, and you have them BOTH!As I was walking out of the theater, people were laughing and joking about the movie with their friends.

Laugh out loud funny!,"Wedding Crashers was great! We decided to go see it on a whim, not having much information about it -- I think it was best that way, as many movies are spoiled by their best scenes being shown in the previews. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are perfectly paired as good-natured, bickering buddies with obvious affection for one another. I think it was a perfect casting for parts requiring a ton of dialogue.The movie sets up the premise very well, making Wilson and Vaughn believable as best friends with a long history. Theirs is a very light-hearted, madcap existence and it's easy to relate to the experience of being at a wedding. When they get to the wedding that leads them through the rest of the movie, a great cast of characters is introduced. Rachel McAdams is bright, funny, and even speaking as a female you can't take your eyes off her. Christopher Walken, Jayne Seymour, Isla Fisher and Keir O'Donnell are instrumental in making the rest of her family the rich, crazy dysfunctional unit that it is. And the grandmother! Priceless. I think it is by design that you will hate McAdams' fiancé on sight. It's fun having someone to root against.Throughout the movie you will probably find yourself rooting for Vaughn's and Wilson's characters, and they are ultimately the key to this being a funny movie. As men who are unafraid to express their feelings, they say a lot of things that men might think but would never say.There are a lot of funny, if somewhat shocking, moments as this movie puts it all out there. Nothing is off-limits -- definitely not a movie for children, but a great date movie if you've been together with someone for a while. Probably not a great first date movie! It's also refreshing that the movie is not completely predictable -- for a comedy, there are abundant twists and turns, taking the story in directions you might not have thought of.There will be some great memorable quotes from this movie. In all, it's funny, lovable and you will not have wasted your time or money to go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great chemistry between Vaughn and Wilson,"Wedding Crashers was hilarious. There's no doubt it earns its R rating with adult themes, language and some brief nudity, so be warned before you decide to bring the kids or your mom to this one. But its humor doesn't come from raunchiness, it comes from snappy original dialogue and an excellent cast. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson have great chemistry - much better I think than Wilson and Ben Stiller in the several movies they've done together.This is Vaughn's best movie since Swingers, which is in my all-time top 10. I'm not sure yet where I'd rank Wedding Crashers, but I haven't laughed out loud this much in a theater in quite a few years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Shaking my head is all I can do...can't figure out why they had to go to such extremes. Guess the writers, actors, directors never heard that ""less is more""?

Awesome Summer Comedy,"I saw this movie last night at the Ritz at the Bourse (Pihladelphia.) I believe it is the #1 summer comedy. From the time the movie began rolling, to the credits, it was nonstop laughter. Even the serious parts of the movie have a comedic overtone. Following in the path of movies such as old school, and American pie, the jokes are frequently sexual in nature, but hilarious none the less. Vaughn and Wilson were amazing, they have great screen chemistry and their female counterparts did quite well too. The relationships between them were quite believable. Will Farell also did quite well in his role, from the moment he came on the audience was in stitches laughing. This is a must see movie.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Laugh until you cry,"This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. There were numerous occasions when I had tears streaming down my face from laughing so hard at the jokes/circumstances. Vince Vaughn really shines in this film. He is back to his Swinger's roots, and funnier than ever. There was not as much nudity as I expected, and what was shown was brief. The language was not too bad either. The humor is definitely more adult than juvenile. I had a mixed crowd with me, my 41 yr old sister, my 66 yr old mom, my 62 yr old uncle, my husband and a few friends. All of them absolutely loved it! I think anyone from 17-80 would love this film. Wedding Crashers is one hilarious movie with a unique plot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Simply Awful,"I think that a review of someone who saw the film doesn't really help if you don't know if the taste of the reviewer matches yours (for every movie, no matter how good, there's someone who dislikes it...) So, to begin with: in the genre of romantic comedy I liked ""Notting Hill"", ""Love Actually"", ""American Pie"" (I and II), ""Freaky Friday""; I disliked ""Anger Management"", ""Meeting The Parents"" and ""American Pie III"". So, now that you know my taste: I simply fail to understand how this piece of $%^ got such a high rating on IMDb. Beats me! This movie is the most stupid, vulgar and at the same time cheesy film I've seen in the past year! It was getting SO low at times that I was actually wondering if it's a parody, but no, it isn't! It's just pushing the boundaries of stupidity! The general style of this movie is this way-way overdone vulgarity, sort of like ""American Pie III"", but even much worse than that. One interesting point: the movie actually goes straight downhill: it begins pretty good, but gets worse and worse and then a little more -- just when you think it can't get any lower. On top of it all -- it's predictable and boring. Avoid at all cost!",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not just a slapstick,"When you're looking for entertainment in a movie, this is the kind of picture that makes you smile. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are hilarious as a couple of conniving wedding crashers who find they change as they experience true love. The cameos are priceless with Chistopher Walken, Will Ferrell and (no he's not dead) Henry Gibson. I think this will become a minor comedy classic much like Something About Mary. Vince Vaughn has become a comic force in the last few years. His tall stature makes him seem even funnier as he towers over most of the other actors in this film. There's nothing new here with the boyfriend you love to hate, and the girl we want to win over, but the cast carries it off well and you can almost feel the fun they have while filming the movie. This is not a film for children under 15, but the rest of your family will be talking about it over dinner.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Manically funny,"I can't count the number of times water was flowing out of my eyes in this movie. It's a gem, and you need to go see it. It's not perfect, but it's quite brilliant all the same.There are two things that are the strong point of this film. The first is the script. It's so funny, so sharp, that you're left thinking the screenwriters who wrote it are geniuses. One laugh right after the other, and you're not done laughing before another one comes along. People were laughing at different parts of the movie because they might not have catched the other one since the comedy was so rapid, just the way I like them. It'll give me something to look forward to on the DVD.The other highlight was Vince Vaughn. This man is so brilliant. He's not always hilarious, but in this movie his timing was perfect, and his delivery is what really helped the movie move up a notch in the funny department, from hilarious, to classic. Give this man a script and he'll run with it.The romantic element felt tacked on though, even though they set it up early on and everything from John's first lingering doubts about tricking women. I don't think Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams have a lot of chemistry, and I didn't see how they belonged together. I think that a movie that did this part better was Heartbreakers. This had better laughs, but that movie achieved a better balance between the comedy and the romance. At least for this girl.That's disappointing because I like well-done romance in my movies. And that's what keeps this from being 10/10. The ending falls flat, and the dearth of rapid-fire jokes is very conspicuous, even though there are still quite a few left.Be prepared to laugh your head off in the middle of the film and hear them come to a slow halt at the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Sorry, not very funny","I've noticed a trend in American comedies lately. The formula is thusly: you take some somewhat well-known, sometime comedic actors, give them an unfunny script, and then sit back and ask them to make us laugh. This happened in Meet the Fokkers, Guess Who, and most recently, Wedding Crashers.I'm not saying Wedding Crashers is completely awful. In fact, of the three, it's probably the funniest. But so many times, as in the other two flicks, it sets up a scene or situation that simply doesn't deliver. In a scene of touch football, for example, Vince Vaughn is laid flat on his back by the dopey villain character. He can barely breathe; but nobody seems to notice. What's so funny about that? Is he really hurt? How badly? Or is he faking? Why? The situation lingers, so we expect something additional to happen, but it doesn't. I think the trick here is that the audience feels it is supposed to laugh, so some do, even though nothing funny is happening. And then the movie goes through the same exact routine again.And then there is a scene where the same evil guy shoots an innocent Vaughn in the backside with a shotgun for no reason other than anger. The payoff? We see Vaughn having the shot removed from his bare butt. This is funny?The subplot of the young gay relative is excruciatingly bad. The boy is miserable, but then he is used as a whimsical anti-gay plot device. There is nothing funny about homophobic comments about a suffering young man, evenor especially when they come out of the mouth of his doddering old grandmother. If this character had been over-the-top with a lisp and designer clothes and a supremely confident and cocky attitude, it could have been funny, for it would have been teasing his flamboyancy. But here it is just cruel.Christopher Walken is completely wasted in his role. He merely reads his lines; his character could have been played by anybody. When he walks into a room where Vince Vaughn is tied up in bed, we wonder if he will have some sort of witty comment or go into a creepy Christopher Walken monologue about ropes? But for some reason, he does not see the ropes, which makes no sense at all. He sits on the bed, recites some lines, and leaves. Boring.Rachel McAdams, on the other hand, chews the scenery in every scene she's in; I imagine her website might have crashed from all of the hits after WC opened. But she's the great one in an otherwise forgettable movie. Vaughn and Wilson have some good laughs early on, but from then on it's downhill. In a movie dealing with marriage, nothing is ever made of the fact that Vince Vaughn's love interest looks to be less than half his age. Jane Seymour's character places her into a Mrs. Robinson-styled situation with Wilson; but instead of Wilson's normal witty repartee, all he does is look scared, and the scene ends. Will Ferrell has a cameo that goes absolutely nowhere; when that situation became apparent, the director must have told him to start shouting obscenities in order to try to make it funny.There is only so much one can do with a script and direction that don't deliver. You can't put people into odd situations and expect laughs unless you give them something funny to say or do. And having them yell or use dirty language does not help; instead, it smacks of desperation.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Don't bother,"You mean I have to find 10 lines to say about it? That's a challenge. Here goes. A rare film. It might be funny if you watch it backwards, or with the sound and vision off. Otherwise it's not. Had there been a lower vote than 1, I would have given it. Owen Wilson was rubbish as Starsky. He's worse in this. His large sidekick defies description. Or perhaps that's a little harsh. Pathetic would be a good description. It's scary that someone must have been paid to produce this film. Christopher Walken is all that gives it any worth at all, and he must be dredging the bottom of a very deep barrel merely to have accepted the part. The only reason to watch it might be to see if they do get their come-uppance at the end. No, I don't know. I got bored only watching the film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
You need to see this movie.,"I see perhaps 80-100 movies a year, and I have taken the time to write only one comment before, and that was three or four years ago. I watched the trailers for this movie, and I expected it to be mindless entertainment, kind of typical Owen Wilson-Vince Vaughn fare, expecting it to be a 5-6. When I got home and thought about it, I decided that 9-10 was more appropriate, and I hardly ever give a movie a 10. This time I did because of the (1) great performances of Vaughn, Rachel McAdams as Wilson's love interest, Isla Fisher as her sister, and Christoper Walken as the father of the sisters, and (2) and excellent, intelligent script.I was really surprised. The actors in this movie must have had a ball making it because of a great script (R rated for language, but most kids have heard the words before), and the acting performances were all superb. This is, without a doubt, Vince Vaughn's best performance yet. Wilson is Wilson, but he has good lines and delivers them well. Walken is excellent, too. He's had a string of mediocre parts in the not to distant past, but this one allows him to shine, and it is the script and his deadpan way of delivering some lines in funny situations that make him better in this role, almost as good as Captain Koons in ""Pulp Ficton."" The truer test: The audience laughed heartily throughout, and the audience at this showing was, I would guess, an average age of 40.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Vince Vaughn's Best,"As a comedy it is perfect. The movie could even stand as a romance, but as we know it is a comedy. The film is laugh out loud from beginning to end, and the film's best comedian is by far Vince Vaughn. Vince has now become the best of the Frat Pack taking that title from Ben Stiller. Owan Wilson was funny at times, but really the comedy belongs to Vaughn and all of the characters involving him. It was nice to see Christopher Walken in this film, but my favorite surprise casting goes to Will Farel whos character was mentioned throughout the entire film, but you never thought it was going to be Will Farrel. Will also delivers big time in this film, but Farel has yet to be truly successful as the main character. The film is sweet at times, and down right hilarious at other times. By far the best scene in the film is Vaughn's first night at he lake-side mansion. Other funny moments was the football game, the first table scene, and Chaz's (Will Farel) entrance into the story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Not What Is Expected,"I give this movie a 2 because it starts out as fun and funny. Unfortunately, that is the best it deserves. Based on the previews, this film has the premise of being an outrageous comedy. When the film begins, it lays out further premise of being a sex comedy. I'm not opposed to that after growing up with films like Porkys and such. For the first half hour the film delivers pretty much just that with some fair laughs. However, shortly afterward the film begins to deteriorate and moves into a whole different realm of twisted cinematography with little to no humor at all. I can't even classify it as a black comedy. Not only that, but plausibility is completely lost by this point as well. The majority of the film is completely senseless and lacks any real creativity or talent. It plays to an extremely immature and demented mind. Further more, it is long and drawn out and the end couldn't come soon enough.Allow me to say that it scares me to think that society has deteriorated so much that such a film could be considered as anything better than garbage.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Boring Movie with Zero Story,"It's a Very Boring Movie and you should expect it if you read my comment. The movie starts with 15 minutes of boredom with no dialogue scenes of how Wedding Crashers crash weddings. They drink, dance and have fun and all of this the director of the movie shows for 15 minutes with no words from the actors. Actors may have fun but do viewers have fun? Of course, no! We are bored out of our heads. Now, this finishes and editors of the movie show us beautiful Rachel McAdams with half of the teeth white and another half of them being distinctly yellow. Are the editors make fun of Rachel McAdams or they have an idea of human teeth being multicolored? Why did not they use green for that matter? All in all, there is nothing to see in this movie. Vince Vaughn is a terrible actor. There is no story, no plot and the movie is just boring.You can find comments and reviews on this movie which put this movie in one line or even above ""Meet the Fockers"".

The funniest movie ever?,"Quite possibly the funniest movie I've ever seen. I am a huge Vince Vaughn fan and he was absolutely perfect in this role. Of course having Owen Wilson to play off of only made his brand of humor even better.Owen and Vince are divorce arbitrators and work together. they are best friends who share a passion for what else, crashing weddings. I went into this movie thinking it would have some funny lines but they were already shown on the commercials, I was wrong. There are so many funny scenes in this movie that were not even hinted at in the trailers.There are a few plot snafu's but they don't detract from the movie one iota. When this comes out on DVD it is an immediate must have. if you don't like raunchy comedy then it's probably not for you but if you have a sense of humor get the icy hot out cause you will be sore from laughing so hard.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Crashers for life, until one fell in love...","Anybody who is an avid fan of the ""frat pack"" will love this movie do death. And if your not, you will still love this movie to death! Wedding Crashers is so funny, you'll miss certain jokes laughing at the previous ones. I've never seen Animal House but I have seen, Kingpin, Something about Mary, Say it isn't So, Anchorman, and The 40 year old Virgin and I put it on par with those comedy classics.Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson have very different comedic instincts but they play off on another perfectly. Vince Vaughn's riffs from start to finish can at times be so ridiculous, you can't help but to laugh and it starts 2 minutes into the movie. The premise is pretty simple: two womanizers who specialize in crashing weddings for women and free food are stopped dead in there tracks when one of them falls in love with a would-be victim. The hilarity that ensues afterwards is priceless. But the film also has heart to it and you will discover this as you watch on.Wedding Crashers is easily the funniest movie of 05 and one of the funniest movies of the last couple of years. It takes a lot to make me laugh and I've seen this 3 times and I bust a gut each time! Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Crude, Rude, Lame and Trashy","Sadly, especially because the very funny Owen Wilson was in it, if you want to see an unintelligent, extremely crude, soulless movie, go see this one. I got talked into seeing this movie, and it certainly lived up to its R rating. A love story? What a joke. The lamest part (among many) of the movie was when it actually tried to have a serious moment. The whole movie was an insult to the intelligence of the audience. This movie was full of trash from the very beginning. What a letdown, especially from Owen Wilson, who I think is one of the funniest guys on the planet. And Jane Seymore?

"Gives a whole new meaning to the term ""Knee Slapper""","Looking for something to do on a Saturday night with a bunch of friends? Especially in mixed company the ratings and previews just don't do this film justice. Shockingly funny and completely witty, making you simply fall in love with the chemistry between Vince Vahgn and Owen Wilson. It's not one of those comedies where you love the two actors apart and then get nothing when they're together. The Vahgn/Wilson combination worked surprisingly well, making the movie even the funnier.A few scenes seriously push the envelope, with dialogue as well as sex and nudity, but for the most part doesn't get too disgusting for most to bear. A great little chick-flick subplot that could be considered horribly written and corny if it wasn't for the laugh-out-loud comedy. Applause for Rachel McAdams as Wilson's love interest as well as Isla Fisher who pretty much steals every scene she appears in in a hilarious manner. Surprisingly touching and sweet towards the end, all females will fall instantly in love with Wilson's character. All males will fall in love with the humor.

The Best Movie Ever!,"Wedding Crashers had a great cast including Vince Vaughn (Dodgeball), Owen Wilson (Zoolander), and Will Ferrell (Anchorman). This movie centers around John Beckwith (Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vaughn) who are wedding crashers hence the title. They go from wedding to wedding to meet girls to sleep with. But everything changes when they crash that wedding of the daughter of the US Treasury Secretary William Cleary (Christopher Walken). When they arrive at the wedding John sees one of the secretary's daughter Claire (Rachael McAdams) and falls in love with her. At the same time Jeremy meets the secretary's third daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher). Gloria becomes obsessed with Jeremy and he labels her as ""a stage 5 clinger."" when they are invited to the secretary's summer home John wants to go so he can try to steal Claire from her boyfriend Sack (Bradley Cooper). After that the movie only gets better from there with other great characters including the secretary's wife, Kathleen (Jane Seymour), his son Todd (Keir O'Donnell), Grandma Cleary (Ellen Albertini Dow), and Father O'Neil (Henry Gibson).I have always been a huge fan of the frat pack movies but this is by far my favorite. In fact Wedding Crashers is my favorite movies of all time. This is the kind of movie that is so funny that you can't remember all of the funny parts because there are so many. Wedding Crashers is not just a funny movie, it also has a great story to it. It is also a movie that you can watch over and over and never get tired or bored with it.

Don't forget the blending of romance between Rachael McAdams and Owen Wilson. Don't be repulsed by the romance. It is a great movie and deserves to be in the top 250 IMDb movies. Lets get it there.

Wedding Crashers,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, the story starts off with a bang. It is funny clever and most importantly original.

Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Christopher Walken, Rachel McAdams, Isla Fisher, Jane Seymor, Bradley Cooper, and Will Ferrel all perform great.The pacing starts off very fast but slows down towards the middle and the end. The runtime is a little overlong as well.This film is one of the best comedies of the 21st century. It belong in the ranks of The 40 Year Old Virgin, 21 Jump Street, and Superbad.Pros: Funny jokes, great characters, original story, good romantic plot line, and great actingCons: Slow pacing in the middle and the end and an overlong runtimeOverall Rating: 8.0",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
What the hecks the fuss about?,"Can't understand why some people regard this as a ""must-see comadeeee"". The plot, or whatever it was, was so bad that it was easy to see how it was going to end. Owen Wilson certainly can't act and WHO THE HECK TOLD HIM HE COULD! There is absolutely nothing that hasn't been done before in countless other movies and above all that there is some un-necessary nude shots. Okay, so it is a romantic comedy but come on it has to have some originality. It seems now-a-days that all you need to make a comedy movie is one good joke and a weak storyline. I could go on and on about how bad this movie is and might have to as this review will not see the light of day if it does not have the required amount of words or lines or something. So you will forgive me if I say the movie was crap, crap, crap, good in parts, not really, it was crap, crap, crap, Jane Seymour, good to see her back, but it was crap, crap, crap, hay, I just rhymed there, back and crap, lets see if I can do it again.

What I really liked is that this movie is truly a story about their friendship and the passage of time...in a quirky, raunchy sorta way...which is really well done. The supporting cast are all lovable characters and definitely give the movie such flavor and personality.

Absolutely wild and wacky comedy that will make you laugh until it hurts,"28 DAYS, in my opinion, is an absolutely wild and wacky comedy that will make you laugh until it hurts.

However, if anyone crashed my wedding like they did, I'd never forgive whoever did it. When Kat (Jane Seymour) told Jeremy she wanted him, I felt a little bit uneasy.

"They rated this one ""R"" for a reason...;-)","This is a very funny movie, and has an interesting, if not totally original, plot, but altogether is definitely an enjoyable film to watch. Though they did rate this ""R"" for a reason. It's very, very, naughty. The summary doesn't do it justice. Obviously, you'd think a movie called ""Wedding Crashers,"" about two friends who pick up women at weddings, would be raunchy, but....IS THIS RAUNCHY. A bit too raunchy sometimes, though. It's nice, however, that the guys don't want to pick up beautiful, sexy women forever. They, like everyone (except for Will Ferrell's character, Chaz), want to settle down at some point, which was nicely shown in the movie. So it did have some depth. Ultimately, though, this probably won't win any Oscars, but it still counts for a good time. :D",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Crashers is a non stop laugh riot,"It is good to see the crude movie back again and done as good as any of of them.This movie has good dialog some of the best I've heard,and Vaughn deliveries the lines as brilliant and funny as he always does i mean come on the man has one of the best deliveries in Hollywood.While Owen Wilson was just as good as he always is,i feel maybe picking the movie up a bit in the ending when it was getting slow one of the few times the movie had slow bits in it.Usually after about a hour and a half i get antsy in my seat but this movie had me laughing every 5 minutes and never bored me, kept me on the edge of my seat LAUGHING.Not to mention the women in the movie were awesome ,comically and nice on looks and Fisher is funny as heck ,Walken is good in it to but not as noticeable as Vaughn,Wilson,Fisher and Adams but his part wasn't as critical to the movie as there's but he was good as always.Also when my fiancé goes to a movie a hr into the movie shes restless and when she heard it was a 2 hr movie she was worried but she laughed all the way through it and by the end she wasn't restless at all and enjoyed it being that long.Any movie that keeps her still and not complaining about how long it is by the end has my vote.The Wedding Crashers is a great summer comedy sleeper that will be placed on my top 10 comedy movie list and will be in my DVD collection release day.All in all a fun ,funny movie that will have you in stitches if you have a sense of humor and a funny bone in your body.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Flawed but very very funny.,"Wedding Crashers - Two men (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn) crash weddings for food, parties and women. However their plans go awry when they both discover love in two sisters (Rachel McAdams and Isla Fisher), one of them with a boyfriend, the other a freaky crazy girl. This movie has some very funny moments. Wilson and Vaughn make a good strong team. Not only were there numerous giggle points, but I had my head buried in my hands about 15 times throughout the movie in laughter. The dinner table scene easily tops that of the one in Meet the Parents.The movie could've set out to do more than the whole ""get the girl"" scenario that has been done ad nauseum, but it's probably among the best attempts at the silly romantic/comedy. The violence isn't purely comedic. These tackles and punches really hurt and had me ""Oohhing"" (and saying other things, but those are R rated) in commiseration. However, some of the silly scenes (like the Will Ferrell shtick) don't really fly, and it sticks out like a big ol' sore thumb, but it leads to one of the biggest ""OH MY GOD"" moments in the movie.Some people that are more politically correct than I might have problems with certain characters in the film. Whatever I say. The problem for me was that the movie goes on for about 20 minutes too long. It could've done with some editing. If you go for this sort of comedy, as I do, that you'll like it. If you don't, you'll still laugh and probably enjoy yourself. This gets a B+.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Why wasn't wedding crasher on the guidance counselor's career lists?,"Wow, when I was in Grade 9, I was called into the guidance counselor's office and he asked me what I wanted to be when I graduated high school. I remember seeing tons of occupations on those lists, but why wasn't wedding crasher on there. If it was, I would have definitely chosen that and became successful, because honestly it looks like lot's of fun.Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn play two single guys who are, ""Wedding Crashers"", basically they show up at weddings (not there's) and have a blast, oh did I mention the reason that they do this is to meet women. Personally I think Owen and Vince are hilarious, and lately they've had some memorable comedic roles, which I thought were excellent, those were nothing compared to this movie.This movie is the BEST comedy ever, it might as well be called the BEST movie ever. Why? It's got comedy, romance, a couple sad parts where you kinda pity people, oh did I mention that there's a lot of great lines as well. It's got so many great lines that you have to watch the movie about 5 times to catch them all.Finally they show up at a wedding and Christoper Walken is there, and he's really successful, and the two ""crashers"" fall in love with Walken's daughters. One's totally ready for a relationship and the other one is, well...she's already in one. Will Owen and Vince get the daughter's to fall head-over-heels in love with them? To find out the answer I encourage everybody who loves a buddy movie, comedy movie, romantic flick to watch this movie. By the way Will Ferrel from former SNL fame makes a memorable appearance as well.

It's too bad there was this ""funny-man wanna-be"" talking over him all the time. The only times I wanted to laugh out loud were squashed by the obnoxiously unfunny Vaughn. Wilson has such a great on-screen presence, why would any writer, director, producer, or co-star think otherwise? Maybe they think like me and know that Vaughn makes everyone around him look talented, afterall. I dunno.

An Almost Perfect Romantic Comedy,"In an age in which Hollywood has been lambasted for its lack of fresh new movies, the romantic comedy sub-genre has taken leaps and bounds (largely under the critical radar, but nevertheless vastly significant). In my opinion Wedding Crashers can be safely added to the cannon of recent smash successes. The film, which follows the dynamic journey of two wild wedding crashing bachelors (played with heavy dollops of charisma and chemistry by the incomparable comic team of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson) as they wrestle with life's dilemmas and love. As aforementioned Vaughn and Wilson are spectacular, delivering nearly flawless, hilarious, yet emotional deep and touching performances. The supporting team is just as praiseworthy. Rachel McAdams who has proved her acting chops in pieces as varied as The Notebook, Mean Girls, and Red Eye once again shows off her inimitable charm as the extremely likable yet troubled Claire Cleary. Christopher Walken is brilliant as always in the role of Secretary of Treasury William Cleary and Jane Seymour, renown for the title role on the long running CBS drama Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, gives an inspired (however clichéd) turn as Mrs. Cleary. Isla Fisher (Gloria) and Henry Gibson (Father O'Neill) round out a talented and quirky cast with Ellen Albertini Dow in a bit role as the Cleary's opinionated bigot of a grandmother.The script, craftily penned by Steve Faber and Bob Fisher, works brilliantly as a comedy, but where the story really succeeds is in its poignant portrayal of human love and what that REALLY means. This is far more than just a ""sex comedy,"" as it may appear on the exterior, rather a laugh a minute, but touching journey with some of the most likable, yet flawed, characters you're likely to meet.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Two friends crash weddings,"Hilarious Wedding crashers is probably one of the best recent comedies. The opening montage is a particularly engaging introduction, flying by to the tune of ""shout"".As the story develops it might seem that the intro is a bit misguiding as the film develops into a sort of ROM- com, but nevertheless is great to watch with many laughs and a cross between funny situations and one- liners.What really makes the film work is Wilson and Vaughn, extremely believable and funny as hell, both are equally funny in different ways and make characters that could so easily have been clichéd and boring absolutely hilarious.The film does have its shortcomings- the swearing granny is far from original and, yes it does drag on a bit too much, but both of these are minor things as overall the movie captures a great balance between romantic, sensitive moments and laugh out loud humour.Really enjoyable, worthy of 2 hours of anyone's time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Intriguing premise but crashes and burns badly after 5 minutes,"Owen Wilson, the man who has a nose resembling an intimate part of the male body, finally rids himself of a co-star that outshines him like Jackie Chan or his best buddy, Ben Stiller. It's rather unfortunate that the vehicle he's chosen is such a waste of a life.The overall idea of having two guys, the other being the rather intimidating Vince Vaughn, lie through their teeth to get laid and doing it at weddings, to which they are not invited smell great at the beginning but soon turn into a fume-infested stink fest and that's just at the start of the movie.The turning point is when we first meet Wilson's lady love. She is presented as such a cuddly, too good to be true, stand up babe, that when Wilson engages in a rather sappy first encounter talk with her, you know virtually everything that is going to happen next, including Wilson falling head over heels in love and that the two guys get to grow up mentally. One of the rather simple lessons in this movie is that Wilson and Vaughn are too old to crash weddings: (Quote (Wilson)): I'm still young."" (Some lady): ""You're not that young.""The supporting cast is what saves the movie from being a total bomb but is Christopher Walken really that hung up for work that he wants to play a role mimicking Robert De Niro's in Meet the Parents. His Father of the Bride (another movie rip-off) is so hard-nosed at the beginning but soon falls into the same ""go with what makes daughter happy at the end.""The obstacle, of course is a psycho boyfriend who we know will get shafted by Wilson and Vaughn right when we first meet him. The sister, who Vaughn is forced to couple up with was the one decent surprise. The actress who plays her seems like ten fingernails scratching a blackboard but she wins you over like something that is very nice to have around. The less said about Jane Seymour's rather embarrassing bedroom scene the better and that goes for the brother's as well.So to sum up Wedding Crashers is a glass of fresh milk that gets tepid the more you leave it out of the fridge and leaves you with a sour smell and bitter taste, but nice try Wilson. Hope in the future you will return to supporting parts where you are best suited.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Greatness Comes at Last,"Probably one of the best wedding movies you will ever have the pleasure of watching, it is just wonderful. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn star as John and Jeremy, two lawyers who crash weddings for a living. And this is most likely the best Frat Pack film to date, or at least up there with ""Old School.""It's comedic and romantic, entertaining glory that brings us ""Wedding Crashers"" from director David Dobkin. I first saw this film over two years ago, and from the first time until now, it has become an instant classic comedy film. The best part of the film though has got to be when we see Will Ferrell for the first time, it is just hilarious.So far, no other film has surpassed ""Wedding Crashers"" in popularity within the Frat Pack line of movies. As much as we all seem to like the film, I was only able to give this one a 10. Excellent!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Unbelievably funny,"What a funny film. It had it all and i found it great. The cast works perfectly and with a lot (and i mean a lot) of laughs scattered through a gloriously original plot.It has it all and the actors do so well with each other. With so much comedy the film surely had to have its downside?? Nope it was all there from start to a very cool finish. Not giving it away but the church scene is fantastic!! a must see for all comedy fans, and also for grumpy sods who need a laugh. Oh and the grandmother is sooooooo funny!!I have said that this film is funny, and that does not do the film any justice at all. I marvel at its ingenious original plot and how the film makers have played it our. The characters are great and the ending gives all the just deserts you want without being crazy. I found the whole film to be amazing and i will buy and watch it over and over again.I you like comedy you'll love this film!! A must see for 2005. Best film ever!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One of my best comedies of all time,"Comedies are one of my favorite types of movies. I heard about Wedding Crashers before but didn't really know what to expect. Well, they surpassed my expectations in a big way. The movie had everything a great comedy should have. The actors were picked just wright for the movie. Of course the best part were the dialogs. There were so many funny moments that I probably missed a quarter of them (watching with my 2 year old playing/making noise in the background). Overall, highly recommend it. A great movie to watch on Sunday evening. Will definitely watch it again as I have to place this movie within my top 3 comedies of all time (Groundhog Day and Multiplicity come to mind as the other two).

Not that funny,"Typical one-joke Hollywood movie put together with the usual lack of respect for the audience and aversion of creativity. But it will make a lot of money and therefore it will encourage the release of more similar if not worse clones. The set up goes on and on for no reason. The story itself is beyond refried. From a screen writing point of view the final scene is a disgrace: it just doesn't make sense. You pay for the mostly unoriginal funny scenes with tons of predictable and/or cheesy moments. On top of that, it's way too long. Wait for the DVD. Skip that: wait for the network release. You really don't need to watch it now.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Vince Vaughn+Owen Wilson+Will Ferrel...Want more?,"Wedding Crashers is one of those films that make person go to the movie theater, and one month after that, rent a movie again and watch it seven times in a row! Vince Vaughn showed that he is the king of comedy. Nothing less successful were Owen Wilson and Chris Walken, but Vaughn is Vaughn. Also, female population in this film are beautiful, especially Rachel McAdams and Isla Fisher. Not to mention all those girls from wedding ceremonies in the beginning. Even if David Dobkin made perfect choice among his stars,I would give this film grade 12, not 10. Explanation is simple: Will Ferrel.

Crashers made me believe in comedy!,"Its been so long since I've seen a good comedy. Comedies these days are so generic and un-funny. Wedding Crashers is the best film that I've seen in the last few years hands down. I've long been saying that Vince Vaughan should be in every movie regardless the theme. His performance in this movie is incredible and hilarious. This movie was real comedy, not just people tripping and falling and having incredibly awkward situations. The acting was great and Rachel McAdams brings the light to any movie. She's beautiful in a way that just makes your eyes dance when she's on screen.Ten out of ten baby!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
very good movie,"I watched wedding crashers last night, and I found it to be a very funny and entertaining comedy. The movie had many hilarious scenes and had a great plot. I've read many bad reviews about this movie, but they're mostly wrong. The chemistry between Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn is great. They worked surprisingly really well together, and although I've really grown to dislike Vaughn, I found him to be hilarious in this, and actually thought that he portrayed his character very well. Wilson as usual was hysterical and nailed every line to the 'T'. Also towards the end, Will Ferrell makes a short appearance where he is actually funny (funeral crasher). Altogether I enjoyed this movie and found it to be very funny. Id recommend people to go see it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wedding Crashers- Please Say I Don't for This One **,"Inane story about 2 jerks, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn who crash weddings to meet girls and have a good time. How do they manage to get in and mingle with the guests? How did they manage to make a movie like this?At one wedding, the guys make such a good impression that they are invited to the country estate of Christopher Walken, who looks like a swollen nut-job in this one. Walken, a well-known economist, aspires to the presidency. Little does the public know what a dysfunctional family he has. A mother who curses and states that her grandson (totally off-the-wall) is a homosexual and that Eleanor Roosevelt was a lesbian. A wife, Jane Seymour, who tries in vain to impersonate Mrs. Robinson from ""The Graduate."" 2 flaky daughters and a vicious son-in-law to be round out this dysfunctional family.Love does conquer all but everything comes the hard way.The first wedding they crash is a Jewish one and it seems they have the most fun there.

This is one to see in the the theater as the reactions from other people in the audience are almost as much fun as the movie itself!

"Oh, so pale, so pale, so pale...","Indeed, so pale. This movie does not have a hint of intelligence, and so many call it remarkably funny-. But funny comedies are truly the ones that remain to the passing of time: no one will remember ""Wedding Crashers"" in 10 years for its ""un-aging"" script, but for its supernatural box office report. Owen Wilson is one of Hollywood's worst actor: try to think in any good role of him (or at least serious) Vince Vaughn talking fast and without mistakes? A pond in the screenwriter's continuity (if any). What is it with development of movies that the script has the same pattern everywhere? ""Supposedly"" funny introduction-Light Comedy-Corny Introduction of Love Story-Conflict with moral dilemma.I didn't laugh at once, the characters are so mistaken for funny prototypes; the scenes are uncomfortable and painful. The script doesn't even exist. Nothing remembering good, warm movies or at least pseudo-intellectual like ""Matrix"". They don't have to be intellectual, but at least sharp like Shyamalan's twists, or stupidly hilarious like ""Scary Movie"" I didn't like the movie, because it didn't apply to my sense of humour. Maybe if you are in a sad streak, or you have a light laugh and a nice mood, you watch this and like it with a little bit of sympathy. Try, I disliked it. Besides: who is the director?

A great summer comedy!,"What can I say about the Wedding Crashers - other than it probably doesn't really deserve it's R rating - I have definitely seen much worse. It will probably get a 15 rating in the United Kingdom, which means you must be 15 to see it.We need some new age restriction ratings here too.Anyway, I digress. Owen Wilson is great in this movie, well actually, he is the same as he is in every other movie, but he is a funny guy, he knows his strengths in comedy and he plays his role well. And what can I say about Vince Vaughn, the big guy - he is just funny every which way.The one to look out for is Australian born newcomer Isla Fisher - you won't know the name so let me just say she is Vince Vaughns CRAZY girlfriend in this movie. She steals so many scenes with her deranged laugh and comical expressions.I would vote Wedding Crashers as the surprise hit of the summer - streets ahead of the rest of the dross out there (don't get me started on Stealth, good grief!).Go and see the Wedding Crashers if you liked movies like American Pie, Dodgeball, etc. You are guaranteed to laugh and 100% guaranteed to have a great date, if this is your date night movie.I gave this movie a solid 10 out of 10 because it delivered everything the movie posters and trailers promised - I did laugh out loud, I had fun and I left the theater with a smile on my face.Definitely one to buy on DVD!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
pretty poor fare in a tough genre,"Another romantic comedy that is just not up to par. Let's start with romantic - Owen Wilson's character doesn't have to work very hard to be with the girl. Zak is obnoxious from the off, there is NO REASON this woman would be with him. We don't respect her for that choice, so we don't respect Owen Wilson choosing her. And the climactic scene - could they be more obvious in ripping off Four Wedings and a Funeral? Unfortunately, the comedy also falls flat - Vince Vaughn, who I liked in The Break-Up, is really forcing his humour here. All his lines seem contrived, like he is trying too hard. The quail hunt was the first time I smiled, and thank God for Will Ferrell, who livens things up with his cameo. There's a nice little montage for Wilson's lost days near the end, but there are no laugh-out-loud moments like There's Something About Mary or Four Weddings. As for the other stock characters, it was great to see Jane Seymour as smoldering as ever but she is wasted as the horny mum. Foul-mouthed granny was cringe- inducing, while the gay little brother was out of sync with the feel of the film. Only the scary little sister was a worthy creation. In short, a worthy cast ill-served by a poor script.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Old retired military guy finds this movie to be very, very funny.","First, a mild warning to those who automatically find all references to sex to be gross and offensive - this movie is full of those moments. It's a very funny movie, but just from reading these reviews I know that not everyone will appreciate it. So, be forewarned.Likewise, for some of those thin-skinned folks - many of whom are probably veterans-groupies who might themselves never have served a day in uniform - who object to a 10-second scene in which the boys talk about using Purple Heart medals to impress women, my advice would be to calm down and just keep saying, ""It's only a movie."" As a retired military man myself I found absolutely nothing to object to. It's a movie!As has been commented on elsewhere, this really is a ""guy movie"", but what's to prevent a woman from liking a guy movie? Nothing. A good laugh is a good laugh. Even though I'd never especially cared for Owen Wilson, and had never even heard of Vince Vaughn, I enjoyed them both in this flic. As has been pointed out over and over, they have very good chemistry together.These two guys have only one goal: by attending weddings uninvited to eat as much free food, to drink as much free drink, to bed as many women, and to have as good a time as possible. Like it or not, this is almost the definition of young men! These two laugh, they spread good cheer, they hurt no one.

They had such great chemistry that it makes it seem that they really had been best friends for years.I thought the supporting actors (Christopher Walken and Will Ferrell) were just as funny as Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, and I don't think anyone could have played their characters as well.It is so much more than your average comedy.

The Unfunniest Comedy of the Year,"""Wedding Crashers"" just isn't that funny, though I think it wants to be. After a dazzling, energetic initial fifteen minutes or so, the movie settles into a hum-drum, routine comedy formula and never recovers. Owen Wilson is low-key and pleasant enough to carry it through, but Vince Vaughan creates a grotesque caricature that ceases to be funny early on. There are lots of subplots that could have made the movie a cut above average, but none of them go anywhere, and an actor like Christopher Walken is utterly wasted in a disposable part. Come on, if you have someone like Walken in your movie and you can't find anything funny for him to do, you've got serious problems.The film goes on far too long, and its final quarter gets downright depressing before everything resolves itself predictably in a corny finale.I thought this was supposed to be the funniest movie of the year--must have been an unusually unfunny year.Grade: C",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Surprisingly funny...,"These days if Hollywood manages to make something remotely good its a surprise. I came into this on the recommendations of others expecting it to be bad even by Hollywood's standards. So to say I was surprised by this movie would be an understatement. I was honestly somewhat shocked by the fact than when it ended I had a good feeling, a feeling like I had just been entertained and that my hard earned dollar had been spent (reasonably) well. WEIRD.The movie obviously is about wedding crashing so its somewhat lewd, but its more funny lewd than grotesque lewd. That I think was the saving grace of this film. Somehow it took questionable behavior and turned into to watchable fun. In the end we learn that even wedding crashers have feelings. And while I doubt that in real life people who act like this have such dynamic and likable personalities the point of the movie is still well taken. There's a special someone for everyone, even the freaks.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Really Fun To See!,"Hi, I just got back from seeing Wedding Crashers and I loved it! This is a fun movie to see so if you're in the mood to smile and laugh this movie is the one to see.

This film stars Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn which is a delightful duo to watch. It also stars Christopher Walkin who always delivers those lines just the way we like it, comical and very much Walkin. As actors they all feed off of each other and keep the laughs coming.

Modern Romantic Comedy,"Just watched this last night and I really enjoyed it. It manages to be something that is pretty rare, namely a romantic comedy that is both romantic and funny. Most romantic comedies go heavy on the romance and soft on the comedy (ie anything with Meg Ryan in it - the odd funny bit/moment - mostly about the every-girl eventually hooking up with the right man). This film is laugh-out-loud funny most of the way through. Its also a great buddy movie and has a great romantic plot line running through-out. The most surprising thing, however (at least for me) was the lovely Isla Fisher. I expected very little from her but she absolutely stole this movie from under her far more accomplished leads. She was cute, funny and utterly terrifying all at the same time. Nice to see a former Perth girl ripping it up. This is not sophisticated in any sense of the word but if you're looking for a light, fun watch this could be for you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A few good jokes don't save ""Wedding Crashers"" from turning into a wannabe sex comedy disaster","The storyline of ""Wedding Crashers"" involves to men invading weddings to meet girls. Eventually, they are invited to stay at a family's house, where both of them try to get their dream girls. It fails for a couple of reasons. Let me explain.First of all, it stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. I don't disrespect these actors, but they have starred in many stupid/silly comedies that haven't succeeded too much. I liked ""Dodgeball"" but disliked ""Anchorman"" and it almost seems like that their next movie is going to be a failure because of what their past looks like. I'm not saying it's bad that they are put in comedies, but it seems kind of clichéd, like putting Clint Eastwood in Westerns. The only real difference is that many actors famous for comedies (such as Adam Sandler) have had a history of bad movies, (Such as ""Billy Madison"") while most of Clint Eastwood's Westerns have succeeded. (Such as ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."") If you've seen Vince and Owens's past movies, you may not have high expectations for this one. (I hated ""The Big Bounce."")Second of all, the film tries to be a sex comedy, and it fails at that. I saw the unrated version, which meant more vulgarity and more non amusing jokes. For example, take the mom (an old lady) who wants Owen to feel her chest.Is that a bad joke? Yes it is.There are a few good laughs, but they are too simple or cliché to work. They often include simple jokes such as repeating the same word over and over. The rest of the movie is just pure boredom.Owen and Vince are both well-loved comedians, but it seems like they don't contribute too much to their parts. ""School of Rock"" succeeded as a comedy mostly because of Jack Black. But, it seemed like ""Wedding Crashers"" would have done just as well with average actors in their places.""Wedding Crashers"" was obviously made because the writers could include women getting topless in many scenes. The two writers of this film (Steve Faber and Bob Fisher) have little experience with movies and don't do comedy so well.There is little to get excited about, because ""Wedding Crashers"" is yet another one of the many comedy disasters out there.3/10Good: A few funny jokes, some people may like the exposure of women in the unrated version.Bad: Clichés, boredom, bad jokes and predictable. The exposition may be a problem to some.Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A Waste of Time and Money,"This was possibly the worst movie since Boat Trip. It was amateur slapstick. Stupid isn't a strong enough word to describe the film.

It could have been very funny if they'd chosen people who could act. It's a crying shame that they didn't.Will Ferrell and Owen Wilson I can understand being in this film. They've both done their share of bad comedies, but I almost expect better from Vince Vaughn, since he shows evidence of some acting ability and comic timing.

If you don't find this movie funny you might be DEAD!,"This was one of the surprise films of the summer. Vince Vaugh carries this film with his non stop, relentless on-point comedic performance. Vaughn spews so many memorable lines a second viewing is almost mandatory to catch all of them. Wedding Crahsers is quite possibly Vaughn's funniest performance since swingers. For those of you who find V Squared's unique style annoying might want to consider staying away from this film, but you would be missing something truly special. The film as a whole is a conventional romantic comedy that is brought to next level by Vaughn. However, Wedding Crashers is not without its faults, the movie does run a little long (about 2 hours)because of two not so funny montages in the film. Another problem I had with the film was how under used Christopher Walken was as the father of Wilson's love interest (Rachel McAdams). Excluding these few gripes and a fumbled cameo performance which could have been hilarious, the film was definitely worth the price of admission. So if you are a fan of some low brow humor in the vain of There's Something About Mary or Old School, you will dig Wedding Crashers.

audience thrashers....,"Movies are about escapism, yes. But what the frig world did this gas-brained comedy take place in? Weddings that have the atmosphere of one of those overblown Academy Award dance numbers; where every sexy woman is a no-nonsense slut; and rich families portrayed not only as dysfunctional, but that would require sixteen closets to hide the skeletons and black sheep.As far as the cast, Vaughn, he's an okay actor. He has that puffy, charismatic every-guy quality that can work at times. Wilson on the other hand...a short, youthfully-faced dweeb who looks like he has a 30-year-old wig on his head. Walken (as usual) can just make you laugh with his now patented vocal approach, and Seymour now officially qualifies as a GILF who could steam up a teenager.But this dead, wish-fullfillment screenplay gives no one anything unique to do in the slightest, and leaves you raging your fists at the skies as to why it made so much money. When you constantly see major league athletes listing this as their favorite movie of *ALL TIME*, you know the fabric of the universe is in a catastrophicly failing flux.We've all been to weddings, right? Let me follow that up with this: when have you *ever* come close to experiencing anything like this? If you have, write a book, I'd love to read it. For me, been to about 15 weddings in my life, and allow me to summarize *my* experience: *EVERY*, every woman comes with a date. There are no hot, single, promiscuous bimbos hoping to get nailed; nobody takes to the dance floor in frenzied abandon to hoist people into the air; the food sucks; and everybody wants to leave the reception after about an hour.Now, make *that* into a watchable film.

I felt my IQ dropping as this dreck progressed . . .,"So you want to know why film attendance is dropping, and what's wrong with the Hollywood product today? This film could offer some answers in any serious study on the topic.Oh, sure, it's still drawing crowds, but I believe it's doing that at the cost of serious filmgoers swearing off any further such efforts towards seeing what Hollywood thinks is funny nowadays. In short, Preston Sturges and Frank Capra this is not.There is some quick-and-snappy frat-boy dialog, okay. Not okay is that it's delivered to Henry Gibson, get it? You know, the stereotypical old guy with a befuddled expression at all the oh-so-hip talk from these modern whippersnappers, or so we're supposed to think?

the funniest movie of 2005!,"wedding crashers is by far one of the most hilarious comedies i have seen in the year 2005!!! owen Wilson and vince vaugn play two 30-something divorce mediators and friends John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey who share the hobby of crashing weddings in order to pick up women for a one night stand. however, when they attend a wedding of the daughter of the secretary of the treasury, one of them gets into trouble (the girl wants a committed relationships) while the other feels like he has met his true love, but his true love already has a boyfriend.the reason why this movie is so funny is the fact that Wilson and vaugn work so well together on screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
So goddamn funny!!!!!,"So goddamn funny! This movie really rocked! I didn't know what to expect when I noticed that Owen Wilson was one of the main characters. In his earlier movies I thought that he was kind of pale and he was not funny. In my earlier opinion Owen Wilson wasn't that good in acting, but after I had seen this movie I totally changed my opinion. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn did amazing acting, I loved the combination!This comedy movie is one of the greatest I have ever seen. It's better than films such as ""Old School"" and ""American Pie"", it beats them all!

GEEZ, just show a couple hours of the THREE STOOGES ...that will bring back the public! And I also cant stand looking at that warped,broken,misshaped nose of Owen Wilson That think is scary!

This movie rocks,"This movie was very very good. i had high hopes for it and was not disappointed. First of all I love Vince Vaughn and have always been upset that he hasn't a great role since 1996 Swingers. This is the vehicle which will truly let him shine. He is hilarious and shows what a genius he is at comedy. Owen Wilson isn't bad. I like him too but he's not Vince Vaughn. I thought that Vince's girlfriend in the movie was also awesome. Not only was she zany and kooky but she was very pretty. Normally i am a fan of Rachel McAdams but she just was very plain Jane in this movie. Nothing great. Overall, the movie was so funny I am planning on seeing it again next week. This is movie both women and men will enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
....and hilarity ensues,"This movie is the latest from the group that has formed over the years of Stiller, Black, the Wilson Bros., Vaughn, and Ferrel. Some of the comedies that have sprung forth from this group have been excellent and the laughs provided have been well worth the ticket price (anchorman, old school), others .... well, not so much (envy, dodgeball). I am happy to report that this is one of the former. Sure, the plot is as predictable and clichéd as any Hollywood machine movie, but this comedy separates itself from those and from the other films from this troupe by being genuinely hilarious. The plot may be formulaic, but the jokes are not. Even in the greatest of the movies featuring these players the jokes have been expected and while funny, not enough to knock you on your ass (although funny enough to quote continuously for months following the initial viewing). This flick has that punch to its jokes and that is exactly what makes it so great. That is what separates it from other movie and that is to what it owes its success. The outline and the previews don't seem at all fresh, but the jokes are crisp. Plus any movie with Christopher Walken is good in my book.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I hate this movie.,"Wow...just...wow...This movie just brings bad to a whole new level.Why...why is everyone raving about how hilarious this movie is? It took about 15 minutes before I started to see things that I even suspected were supposed to be jokes, and even then I wasn't sure if people were supposed to find it funny. I honestly had trouble distinguishing between what was supposed to be considered funny and what wasn't, save for some parts that were incredibly over-the-top attempts at comedy.The worst things about this movie are the two main actors.Vince Vaughn is too old for this role. It was painful to watch him struggle as he desperately tried to prove he is still ""hip"". When I wasn't cringing at Vaughn's attempts at hilarity, my eyes were transfixed on Owen Wilson's malformed nose. If it wasn't for the fact that about 90% of Wilson's movie's sucked, I'd say he's way passed his prime.No, I don't hate comedy. I love comedy. I love comedy that is genuinely funny. But I didn't so much as crack a smile at this movie. Seriously. Not once. And not only were the jokes crappy, but a lot of the time the movie was just so slow with nothing happening that I'm surprised that any of the jackass teens that made up about 9/10ths of audience guffawing every 5 seconds at everything could possibly have sat through this.I won't say that people who like this movie are stupid but...well...I can't think of an honest way to end this sentence without insulting people. It's scary how soon we can all expect a bunch of idiots crashing weddings across the globe trying to imitate those 2 failed comics.Bottom line: Boring, soulless, and just plain not funny. Easily on my list of top 10 worst movies of all time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Vince Vaughn's Best Film Yet!!!,"If you liked Swingers, Made, or Old School you will think Wedding Crashers is funnier than all three. This is Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn at there absolute best. Not only is it refreshingly an R rated movie, as all good comedies should be, but it has the best cast a comedy has had since Airplane! Rachel McAdams is to die for and Isla Fisher plays the role of the dirty younger sister, perfectly cast and cleverly written. Finally, the movie pays homage to past flicks such as The Accused, Cybill, and a great book The Dangerous Game--all are worthy of checking out if you are unfamiliar. The movie could've been 15 minutes shorter towards the end but it is still one of the funniest movies I've seen in years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"You can find happiness at a wedding, especially if it is not your own","(Synopsis) John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) are business partners and lifelong buddies. They are divorce mediators with a recreational hobby of crashing weddings to pickup chicks. They've been given a secret set of wedding crashing rules by Chaz (Will Ferrell) the guru of wedding crashing. John and Jeremy crash any and all weddings and pretend to be brothers working as venture capitalists or some other line of work. They are so charming that they are able to bluff their way through each wedding when relatives ask who they are. Each spots a beautiful woman and catches her eye. Eventually, each wins the chosen woman's heart, and then it's on to the next wedding! They never stay in the background, but actually get in all the action and pictures of the cutting of the cake, the carrying of the wedding couple, and dancing with the bride. They become a hit at each reception. The daughter of Treasury Secretary William Cleary (Christopher Walken) is getting married, and it will be the social event of the year. After crashing the wedding, John and Jeremy set their target on the two Cleary sisters, Claire (Rachel McAdams) and Gloria (Isla Fisher). Jeremy is able to get close to Gloria, but John has Claire's boyfriend to contend with. John and Jeremy are able to get invited to a weekend party at the Cleary family estate, where they learn a few lessons about love.(Comment) The movie is hilarious from the beginning to the very end. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are naturals when performing their verbal and slapstick comedy. There are several scenes that may make you bust a gut laughing. This movie will help single men by revealing some of the rules and giving them a few pointers on how to pickup women. The moral to the story is that you can find happiness at a wedding, especially if it is not your own. This is one chick-flick you must see.

Pretty lousy movie,"I've always been able to trust other viewers' opinions on this site and have used the scores to decide whether to see a movie in the theatre or wait until it came out on DVD. Until now.My husband and I went to see Wedding Crashers today and it was really disappointing. Cheap nudity, cheesy scenes and a length that dragged between laughs made us wish we had gone to see something else. The acting is okay (although I wouldn't have believed Jane Seymour would lower herself to this film's level) and some of the bantering is snappy and funny, but it doesn't save the movie.There are some funny parts, but overall a disappointing choice to see this movie.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Surprising Wedding,"A bud of mine, Tom, is a master juggler in his spare time. I remember he showed me how to juggle, and the one thing he always did was keep his eye on the ball. This is what Director David Dobkin, does with ""Wedding Crashers"", he keeps his eye on the ball or balls. Dobkin balances what appears to be an outrageous, laugh riot comedy that has something to offend everyone (really praise), with a touching and sweet romance. Dobkin diverts our attention, and surprisingly, the love story ends in the foreground. That being said, ""Wedding Crashers"" will make you laugh harder than any other movie release so far this year. The humor shoots beyond tasteless at times, and is flat out clever funny. Credit the smart and crisp writing of Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. Faber and Fisher transform what could have been ordinary and predictable, i.e. the goof ball guy ends up with the wonderful girl, and avoids the trite ending. Faber and Fisher grant the audience the satisfying pay-out. ""Wedding Crashers"" is also blessed with the genius comedic pairing of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn.Wilson and Vaughn play John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey, who are divorce mediators. Not attorneys. Mediators. Apparently, they are good at it. During the Wedding Season, they are master Wedding Crashers. They have found a brilliant way to eat great food, meet hot women, and get laid. John (Wilson) begins to question their vapid existence. Jeremy reminds him that one day when they're old they'll look back fondly at these days. John points out, ""We're not that young."" They decide to crash the Wedding of the Year. The daughter of Treasury Secretary Cleary (the perfectly cast Christopher Walken) is getting married. John and Jeremy do their research, and attend the wedding posing as investment bankers and distant nephews. Jeremy targets bridesmaid, Gloria Cleary (wild Isla Fisher). John is instantly entranced by her sister Claire Cleary (the amazing Rachel McAdams). During a funny exchange where John guesses wedding gifts, Claire asks John ""What do you think true love is?"" John replies ""True love is the soul's recognition of it's counterpoint, in another."" Claire admits that is ""cheesy"", and is touched. So was I, and completely taken off guard. ""Wedding Crashers"" is a great movie in that it does so many different things in context.Needing more time with Claire, John convinces Jeremy to accept an invitation to the Cleary summer home. The Clearys are the poster dysfunctional family. Wife Kathleen Cleary (stunning Jane Seymour) making a pass at John, tells him that she and her husband were only faithful for the first 2 years of their marriage. Gloria (Fisher) is the entitled rich girl who had her ""Sweet Sixteen"" when she was thirteen. Now she is literally draining the life out of her new sex toy and love, Jeremy (Vaughn). Todd Cleary (Keir O'Donnell) is the misunderstood gay son, who is also attracted to Jeremy. Claire (McAdams) is perfect aside from having a vicious jerk-head boyfriend, Sack Lodge (well played by Bradley Cooper). The Lodge's are an esteemed family, and Sack is some sort of environmental warrior. Basically he is a world-class ass. John tells Claire, ""You don't realize that you deserve to be with someone great..."" The amazing thing in this context, John is not referring to himself.Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are an awesome and classic comedic team. This time around Wilson plays the straight man, John, who falls for Claire. Wilson has his funny lines, though mostly it's his laid back charm and cool that work. He also displays a believable vulnerability. Vaughn is outrageous and displays comic timing genius. His Jeremy even thinks quicker than he speaks. He is pure swagger and confidence. It is hysterical that he is initially terrified by Gloria. What really underpins this comedy and romance, amazingly is the depth and substance of their relationship. After a particularly bad night at the Cleary's Jeremy asks for some alone time from John. What could have been a flip exchange ends up being very understated and sweet. Rachel McAdams is beautiful and completely captivating. Her Claire is smart with a blind-spot (that being Sack), funny, with a great soul. She is John's counterpoint. It's great to see Jane Seymour. She is gorgeous. Her ""Mrs. Robinson"" scene with John (Wilson) is hot and hilarious. Christopher Walken is awesome as Secretary Cleary. He masterfully plays Cleary as self-absorbed on the surface, though he knows, and has unconditional love for his daughters.See ""Wedding Crashers"". Really. It will make you laugh out loud and possibly offend. It will also charm you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Brilliant metaphor for US foreign policy,"Once again, a largely misunderstood movie that speaks wonders about the great nation of the United States. The liberals thought this was a sex-comedy about to promiscuous men who ""crash weddings"" by showing up uninvited. But it is actually a profound statement about American Politics and how we can use it to succeed in the world struggle.First off, the film takes place in Washington DC, the nation's capital city which is not a coincidence. The protagonists of John and Jeremy are not just Americans, they are America! Move over Stephen Colbert. The opening sequences shows how our all American heroes go to various weddings of different cultural back grounds, but it is their American culture that makes the weddings exciting. They are at the center of each event just like the US is at the center of the World's most important political events that take place in different countries. And it is the US that sets things right and makes things end up like they should - with foreign cultures learning the American way of Liberty and Freedom.But like all great studies this film is also very self-reflective as most of the action takes place in an American Families weekend retreat were one wedding just took place and another is in preparation. John and Jeremy boldly refuse the sexual advances of the promiscuous mother and homosexual son thus keeping their purity. I won't give the whole story away, but by the end they really shape that family up and help them make some very tough choices but in the end the American way is preserved. The closing shot on the Washington Monument confirms this: America Stands Tall and Proud. We go through our ups and downs, but we prevail.Bravo to all involved in this cinematic masterpiece of metaphor and transcending ideas. They have truly created an ideologically sound film that was viewed by the largely liberal audience since it was a hit and retains a good rating here on IMDb. Let's just hope that they understood the right way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
unadulterated dross,"I really couldn't see the humour in any of this drivel driven movie. I went to see it because I had read a favourable review of it in a local newspaper. I was cringing during it in trepidation of what lewd tripe was coming next. Similar to when I saw 'Meet the Fockers', I felt as if I should be wearing a dirty raincoat during and leaving the 'movie' and I use the word 'movie' loosely. I must, however, admit to being rather fascinated throughout by Owen Wilson's nose which was the only thing which held my interest. It is a sort of miniature version of a Karl Malden conk. Anyway, conks aside, how anyone can describe this pap as 'Comedy of the Year' is beyond me. A couple of slapstick bits during the baseball game made me smile but that was it. All in all pure tripe.

One of the funniest movies of the last five years.,"If you're one of the 6 people who hasn't seen Wedding Crashers yet I recommend renting it next time you go to the DVD place. Actually, just buy a copy of it because it's that funny and you're going to want to watch it again. I didn't think anyone could hang with Vince Vaughn doing his thing as well as Jon Favreau did in Swingers but Owen Wilson does it here with flying colors. Their interaction and playing off of each other is hilarious from the very beginning of the movie. That opening scene is classic by the way- Rebecca DeMornay ""You shut your mouth when you're talking to me!""- laughing my ass off. Anyway, it's quick at times and sort of clever when Vince and Owen are conversating and it's just what they're talking about with straight faces that makes it so good. Lots of great acting and a surprise cameo towards the end is insanely good. You need to see it- Lock it up! No you lock it up!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A good romantic comedy with a good comedic duo.,"Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Rachel McAdams, Christopher Walken, Isla Fisher, Jane Seymour and Will Ferrell.Jeremy(Vaughn) and John(Wilson) like to crash parties to sleep with beautiful women. They go to a party, make up fake names and identities, and get women from all over. They finally go to a party where John falls in love for Christopher Walken's daughter(Rachel McAdams). Jeremy has sex with her sister(Isla Fisher) on the beach, and she falls in love with him, but he hates her. AS this movie goes along, it becomes more of a romantic comedy, which is fine. McAdams gets angry when John reveals his true identity. She already had a boyfriend and fiancée, but he is a jerk. Jeremy falls for Isla Fisher and proposes to her. John is mad at him, and starts literally crashing weddings drunkenly by himself. Jeremy had often talked about his mentor Chaz(Ferrell) and John went and visited him. He lives with his mom, but has hot women. He then tells John that he's out of wedding crashing, and he's on to funeral crashing. When John goes with Chaz to the funeral, he sees a widow and realizes how low he's sunk. I won't give away the ending, but it's a good movie.

He thought it would be funny in a stupid way. I can't remember the last time I laughed that much! Vince Vaughn delivers a great performance. The only down side to it was that often I was laughing so hard that I missed some really good lines that he fired off. The weakest part of the movie was the small part that Will Farrel had.

"Not quite the funniest thing ever, but getting there...","I can't say how much I loved this movie! Vince Vaughn is just awesome and is definitely the bedrock of the film.

The direction is pretty nifty too, and I like the idea that these guys spend all their time going to weddings and yet they're the biggest commitment-phobics ever. Even their jobs entail mediating divorce settlements. The story moves along apace and none of the jokes fall flat at all.

The only actors who are not ""white"" are portrayed as being either ridiculously simple minded or household help (not members of ""mainstream"" society).There were a few moments that I thought were funny.

I'm amazed,"I walked into the theater expecting a funny male comedy, and being female, I prepared myself for non-stop horrendous sex jokes. I was only slightly off. Yes, most of the best jokes were predominately about sex, but they had me laughing and weren't the only types of jokes offered! And Vaughn and Wilson were fantastic together; it was completely easy to believe that these two characters were long-time friends. Constantly feeding off one another, I was entertained for the entire movie, and that doesn't happen to me often. All the actors in the film, with the possible exception of Cooper, impressed me and were wonderful.

Realism in an unreal plot line,"After letting this movie get hyped up to no tomorrow it was a bit of a disappointment as a comedy. Don't get me wrong, it was hilarious, but it turned out to be more of a romantic comedy than I thought.On that note, it was an innovative and engaging romantic comedy that still followed the basic rule (guy gets girl, guy loses girl, guy wins girl back). I really enjoyed the chemistry between all the characters of the film. Even Walken, who had far too few number of appearances showed great chemistry with Wilson and Vaughn and especially his daughters. But above all, the two couples were completely realistic. Although these relationships formed from unlikely and improbably circumstances, the screenwriters and natural acting ability of Owen and Vince took over and it felt like you were actually watching a ""real"" relationship form.My prime example is when Owen and Rachel McAdams' characters sat on the beach and Wilson sort of stumbles on his words while flirting. He bickers with her about how she has to wait for his hands to be ""set"" for the game of slaps. It was very cute and VERY realistic...That's what makes this comedy so great.

"I'm a tough sell on comedies, but","I'm admittedly a very tough nut to crack on comedies but this one broke the shell wide open. Most of the time I chuckle once and a while at best but I was in stitches for the whole two hours in Wedding Crashers. It ranks up there close to A Fish Called Wanda, When Harry Met Sally and Get Out Your Handkerchiefs in my book. An almost seamless film that takes stereotyped characters and bends them completely out of shape. There's a touch of genius in the interaction between Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn that hints at the great comedy teams of Martin & Lewis, Burns & Allen and Abbott & Costello. Amid their screwball and cynical antics they let reveal an odd but working dynamic that drives through the madness of their own devices. Isla Fisher's addition as the kooky, nymphomanic sister is a great little sidebar entry adding more spice to the stew.This is a movie that easily could have devolved into cheap visual tricks and potty humor but managed to rise to the occasion and deliver a quality product. Even the sappy and predictable ending doesn't diminish its overall shine. A good, solid eight.

"Finally, an adult comedy that is really funny","These days it's very hard to make a funny adult comedy without some group being ""offended"".

Well I for one loved this R rated movie and found it to be one of the most intelligent and well-written movies of the year. The catalyst that makes all this work is Vince Vaughn, I was laughing so hard at some of the predicaments he got himself into that I could not hear all of the fast-talking breakneck lines he was spewing out. And although he kept trying to get himself out of them, one of the Wedding Crashing rules, handed down from one generation to the next, ""Never leave a fellow crasher behind"", kept him coming back for more. Owen Wilson is also very good as the straight man and he has great chemistry with Vaughn. Even though there are a lot of ""Homo"" jokes in this film, these two are so secure in themselves that they can tell each other that they love each other, and you believe them. The supporting cast is also very funny, Christopher Walken (The Continental) is great, Rachel McAdams is a breath of fresh air, and Jane Seymour really pulls off the Mrs. Robertson part. This is a laugh out loud side-splitting film, and although there might be a few slow spots, it is destined to become a comedy classic.

Anyone that would go to see a movie based on the impression they were going to see a lot of tits should just stay home and watch porn.This movie was done well in many ways.

That was nice to see after so many had been chopped to ""PG 13"" to attract a larger audience.It was also nice that the whole movie wasn't spoiled by the commercials. This is definitely NOT one of those incidents where you watch the movie and every funny part was crammed into a 30 second TV spot.This has something everyone will relate to, from the Frat guys and some of the sayings or stories, to the ""always a bridesmaid, never a bride"" that snickers during the wedding ceremony.If you want to spend a couple of hours laughing and having a good time to a movie that actually has a good story line...go see this.

Vince Vaughn should get an Oscar for his tour de force,"""Wedding Crashers"" is the funniest movie I've seen so far. The film is a Vince Vaughn tour de force. Owen Wilson is good in his laid back persona we know so well. There are cameos aplenty and the supporting characters are more than wallpaper to the Vaughn and Wilson skits.Vince and Owen play 2 divorce mediators who love to show up uninvited at weddings for the free food and to pick up single women. That premises is funny by itself. Add in Vaughn's hyperactive party animal we last saw in ""Swingers"" and Wilson's suave intellectual and it takes the comedy up a notch.This film was bust-a-gut funny for adults without being gross. Only one bathroom joke here. It was so nice to finally see a comedy that was aimed at adults and not 12 year old boys. But that doesn't mean 12 year old boys were ignored - there is some good looking women topless through out the film.Rachel McAdams plays Claire, Owen's love interest. She is the most normal of the Cleary clan. Isla Fisher's, who chews up scenes just like Vaughn, plays the spoiled crazy sister Gloria Cleary. Keir O'Donnell as Todd Cleary is the disaffected artist loner of the family and Ellen Albertini Dow plays Grandma Mary Cleary, who has some inappropriate things to say about Eleanor Roosevelt and Todd.While Christopher Walken plays it pretty straight as Secretary Cleary, Jane Seymour plays against type as Kathleen Cleary a sex starved MILF. In one scene where she is coming on to Owen Wilson I thought to myself ""Dr. Quinn!!!"" and her inappropriate comments to Owen during the film were shockingly funny.2nd place to Vaughn for best performance has to go to Sack Lodge, played by Bradley Cooper. Cooper walks the fine line of being an ass and being over the top. He played a misogynist environmentalist who liked to hunt. That was humorous because most would think an environmentalist to be sweet and poetic all the time. Not Cooper and that was fun to watch.The story was predictable but the comedy allowed me to ignore that. The film runs about 2 hours and while it does start to drag toward the end, the final scenes allow it to end on a high note.Vaughn and Wilson were the best when they bickered but Vaughn still had the best lines and best gags. Vince should get some awards out of his performance and with dearth of good movies this year he should not have too much trouble. I dare even suggest an Oscar. His performance reminded me of Kevin Kline in ""A Fish Called Wanda"" and Kline won an Oscar.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Disgusting Movie That Tries To Be Good,"16 July 2005. Unlike ""There's Something About Mary"" (1998), ""The Wedding Crashers"" went over the line with its suggestive scenes, perhaps it's a generation gap, but the movie was a turn off in a number of respect. Owen Wilson's character was an insensitive jerk that provided no sympathy except for perhaps egotistical young adult males in the audience looking for some ideal rationalization why what they lust after is OK after all. This predicable, stereotypical comedy had great potential for a comedy-drama that ended up as male, summer entertainment for the exploitation of women. To its credit, ""The Wedding Crashers"" tries to be good with a morality tale that unfortunately got lost in the good feel movie entertainment. While a couple takes their vows the movie has a our main love interest being insultingly oblivious, just one example of how crass and insensitive this movie is. This uneven comedy promotes the most obvious offensive behavior instead of making this movie a witty, intelligent, comedy drama that it could have been. The script, the director took the easy way out scrambling for gag laughs that sometimes actually hurt (but not in a good way). Since the movie didn't degenerate into complete silliness and grossness five out of ten stars.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Better than dodge-ball or any other film you will watch this decade,"I had to go and see this movie for obvious reasons.After Dodgeball i was waiting for the same sort of comedy for ages.Before i start, i would like to say Vince Vaughn is the funniest movie star in the world today and he is the star of the film by a mile.He is a genius.Isla fisher isn't far behind him as the dumb bridesmaid who is a little crazy and becomes deeply infatuated with him from the start.From start to finish this film is laugh out loud comedy and a film you can watch again and again and never stop laughing.Owen Wilson is great as Vaughns partner as they crash from one wedding to the next but Vaughn steels the show and there's even room for a Will Ferrell cameo which is hilarious.Go and see this film now!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One of the Worst Movies I have Ever Seen,"I'm telling everyone I know, and even you people I don't know on the internet: this movie was horrible. If you want to go pay $7.25 to get much needed time to count ceiling tiles, then this is the movie to do it during (if I wasn't with people in the same car, I would have walked out after minuet 7). You won't miss much on screen; trust me.If you have any sort of morals or hold anything sacred then skip this ""movie"" all together. Let see, if you sympathize with vegetarians, war veterans, artists or women in general, then you're going to get offened. If offers overblown stereotypes to the nth degree, the whole time while being far less than funny. There is a limit to how much you can take in the name of ""comedy"", even if it is 'all in fun'.

Very funny film,"This movie is a very funny, somewhat typical comedy that at times takes it self a little seriously, but nonetheless I found myself laughing the whole way through. Some jokes are stupid, of course, but regardless, many jokes were quick and smart, and I found it to be very amusing. I've seen many, many people bashing this movie on the boards here at IMDb, saying for people who like this movie to ""develop a sense of humor"". Clearly, they don't understand that everyones sense of humor is different, and they shouldn't be bashing other peoples opinions. Afterall, this is an opinion, nothing more. Regardless of what they say, I thought it was very funny, and basically, if you liked ""The Wedding Singer"", you'll probably like this movie, since they share the same humorous portrayals of weddings and the families involved. Also, don't take this movie too seriously, because if you do, it will ruin the fun of it for you and you probably wont like it. Remember, its just a comedy.Well written, well acted, enjoy yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Date Movie For Those of us Who Aren't Whipped,"I hate seeing reviews containing the term, ""this summer's best date movie."" What it usually means is the plot centers around a guy who is half-whipped at the beginning of the movie. Then, by the time Meg Ryan gets done with him at the end, he is completely whipped, a mere shell of his former self. We are led to believe he is happy.Wedding Crashers is a ""new date movie."" It is about men and women, the lies they tell, the sex they enjoy, the fun they have, and...if they eventually become domesticated at the end...its without giving up what made them special in the first place. The trailers and plot summaries for Wedding Crashers may lead you to believe that the movie is about the adventures of two lying and lecherous guys. But, that is only half the story. The women in Wedding Crashers are smart, dynamic, deceitful, and damn sure, every bit as funny as their male counterparts. Women will love this movie, too.Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn play it super cool as two masters of the ""Wedding Crash"" -- freeloaders who cruise the Washington wedding scene in hopes of bedding down love-hungry bridesmaids. Against better judgment and the rules of ""The Crash,"" the pair become over-involved at the wedding of the Secretary of The Treasury's daughter. Violating their usual hit and run mantra, both join the family for an extended party at the official's estate.Here, the casting of Christopher Walken as Secretary Cleary can almost be seen as a decoy. When you see Walken in the cast, you expect crazy. But he doesn't come close to the lunacy displayed by his wife, son, daughters and especially his mother. The hijinks involving Wilson and Vaughn and the various members of the wedding party are fresh, surprising, and for the most part, hilarious. Within it all, a love story sneaks up on you like a full nelson and draws you in before you have time to resist.There would have been so many formulaic ways to create a sappy ""date-movie"" ending out of this story, but thanks to a fantastic script, hysterical performances by Wilson and Vaughn and the freedom of an R rating, Wedding Crashers remains true to its characters. There is no phoniness. We loved these guys at the beginning. We love them at the end. They have not changed for love.Certainly a date movie for today's times, Wedding Crashers says we can be flawed, crude, and chronic liars, and instead of someone being out there to save us, there is someone out there to match us. I found the movie to be refreshing, clever, heartwarming, but most of all, simply hilarious.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Crashing Bore...,"Wedding Crashers' storyline immediately tells you that what you are about to see isn't going to touch the heights of sophistication - it's a film about guys who crash weddings in order to get off with any hot chicks that might be available - so only the most naive of viewers would expect anything other than a lowbrow farce filled with its share of crude and sexist jokes. On this score, Wedding Crashers delivers everything you expect from it - but on all other counts it fails miserably.The chief aim of any comedy, however, is to make its audience laugh, and any comedy that fails to do so must ultimately be considered a total failure. This film barely raised a smile. It never even came close to creating any genuine laughter - just an occasional bemused smile when it rehashed some lame gag that was only mildly funny when it first appeared in Porky's or Pinball Summer or some other eighties teen sex-pic. There's no two ways about it - this film stinks. The only thing it has going for it is a small measure of chemistry between its two male stars and the fact that it is technically competent.Its bad points are many. The plot is entirely predictable and a good thirty minutes too long. The male leads are unsympathetic boors completely undeserving of any audience goodwill, even after their respective moments of so-called redemption, while the females they end up with are badly written and completely unbelievable. Christopher Walken and Jane Seymour are completely wasted in hopelessly underwritten roles, while other characters simply flit in and out of the action with such inconsistency that you get the impression that large amounts of their screen time was sacrificed to the editor's scissors in an attempt to shorten the running time.Bottom line: a big, lumbering mess that should be avoided by anyone with a fully-developed sense of humour.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
great movie,"I have not laughed this hard in a long time. Wedding Crashers was a great movie, very funny and hilarious. From the first 5 minutes in the movie every audience member was laughing hard. But what else would you expect when you put Vince Vaugn and Owen Wilson in a movie together. The casting director was a genius. The movie starts off great when you get to see a day in the life of these two wedding crashers, crashing every kind of wedding that is possible. From Jewish to Chinese, you name it. But the movie really kicks it into high gear when vince vaughn and owen Wilson enter the wedding of all weddings, the Secretary Treasurers wedding, from there, all hell breaks lose.The good points about the movie are that every scene with owen Wilson, and ESPECIALLY Vince Vaughn will have you laughing till your stomach hurts. The only character in the movie that i did not like was this one jerk who keeps getting in the way of owen Wilson and his love interest from being together. The guy acts like he is a psychotic steroid user or something. And I am not homophobic, but that one gay joke was one too many for me. Other than that the movie was great and I highly recommend it.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wedding Crashers,"Wedding Crashers, is about two best friends named John Beckwith, and Jeremy Klein, who work together and in their free time they like to crash weddings. They go to weddings pretending to be related to someone there and hope they can pick up girls. They have done this many times before and the next wedding they crash is of a daughter of a treasury secretary where the two best friends pose as brothers. While at the wedding John meets his daughter named Claire Cleary, and John starts to fall in love with her. Another of the treasure secretary's daughters named Gloria, falls in love with Jeremy. Gloria convinces her dad to let them come and stay with them for awhile at their summer home. John, and Claire really seem to hit it off but she has a mean boyfriend who she may be getting married to soon. And, Jeremy finds Gloria kind of weird and in some ways wants nothing to do with her. Many conflicts arise and so does the humour as the two best friends pose as people they are not and try to not get caught as well as John, trying to woo Claire, and Jeremy trying to stay away from Gloria, and some other members of the very odd family. Wedding Crashers, has good direction, a good script, good comedic performances by Owen Wilson (who plays John Beckwith) and Vince Vaughn (who plays Jeremy Klein) as well as a good supporting cast, good original music and good cinematography. Next to Batman Begins, this film is the second biggest surprise of the year so far. I loved this film. Wedding Crashers, has great chemistry and good comedic performances by both Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn which really make the film work, some smart writing and it is an amusing, charming, fun, entertaining, sweet, enjoyable and everything you could want in a comedy that comes out just perfect. The film makes you laugh, is sweet and a lot of fun too. One of the best comedies I have seen in awhile and also one of the best films of the year so far.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great Movie!,"Saw ""Wedding Crashers"" today and thought it was hilarious. The audience was all walks of life.High school aged to elderly.Everyone laughed hard and there was applause at the end of the movie. While it seems the ""Frat Pack"" is constantly in a new movie every couple months, you can't argue with the comedic results. Anyone who likes Animal House, Bachelor Party,and etc will love this flick! Vaughn really has a better comedic presence than Wilson in my opinion. This Frat Pack seems to be quite the fad for comedies the last few years. In an era of such political correctness, nice to see a flick that isn't afraid to push the envelope with things that most people think but are afraid to express publicly nowadays. Funniest movie I've seen so far in 2005. As an aside, looks way better than that upcoming Dukes of Hazzard movie. That original cast must be in distress seeing their characters botched. ""Crashers"" on the other hand exceeded my expectations and will be on the Comedy channel for years to come I'm sure.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
How can this movie be so popular???,"Wow, I've seen some lame comedies in my time but this was one of the worst I've seen in awhile. First off the premise is pretty offensive particularly if you're a woman... drunken louts, scam weddings and bed women by lying and manipulating... but let's move beyond that. For two guys who specialize in 'crashing' weddings both Vaughn and Owen seem incapable of thinking on their feet even though they reference a list of 'rules' developed by some 'master' wedding crasher. There's no real chemistry between either actor which makes most of the jokes sound awkward rather than funny and it's pretty obvious that Vaughn was enjoying the wedding cakes on set a little too much. There is an extended scene where the two have dinner with the family of a woman that Owen has fallen in love with that is possibly one of the worst I have seen. Every ancient, clichéd dinner gimmick including the 'cute as a button' grandma who gets tipsy and says outrageous things is present. The periodic need for showing topless women also comes across as a sophomoric effort to titillate young men.If this movie makes you laugh then you are indeed very fortunate as there is no comedy you won't find funny.This movie reminds me a lot of Hudson Hawk, it enjoyed a little popularity at the time and then quickly became remembered as one of the worst movies of its decade.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Who gave this movie a rating of 5 and below??????,"I was looking in the voting history and saw a few hundred votes that were 5 and below, and I even saw a couple hundred that were a vote of 1. Whats up with that, do these people that are voting have absolutely no sense of humor? Or, are they just voting a low number cause they hate the actors.

To those of you who voted below a 5, let see a list of what you think are funny movies. Just to ease my curiosity. And what exactly about this movie didn't you like. If you are offended by movies like this, why would you go in the first place to a movie like this?Thanks Josh",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Even funnier than I expected,"I'd heard this was a funny movie. I expected it to be funny. But I didn't expect it to be THIS funny! Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn headline a cast in what must be one of the absolute funniest movies I've seen in years. Part of the comic team that started out with ""Zoolander"" and later the VERY successful ""Old School,"" among others, this is better than both. While movies like those, ""Starsky & Hutch,"" etc. ended up relying quite heavily on the crude and outright disgusting, this movie forgoes much of that in favor of genuine laughs.Vince Vaughn hearkens back to the over-the-top antics he first displayed in the cult hit ""Swingers,"" while, perhaps for the first time, Wilson manages not to irritate me (okay, I'll admit Wes Anderson knows how to use him too). Together they generate enough laughs to sustain the picture by themselves. But luckily they are given a terrific supporting cast to help them on their way.As mediators for couples in divorce settlements, they prove their effectiveness in the first scene, where they disturb separated spouses Dwight Yoakam and Rebecca De Mornay to the point that they want to settle just so these two don't have to talk anymore.These guys do everything together, and they have for the last seventeen years. It is the most homo-erotic relationship between two heterosexual men to be shown in quite some time. The whole movie, they are after women, but it is their bond that holds things together. It has gotten so Jeremy (Vaughn) has promised, in keeping with tradition, never to let John (Wilson) spend his birthday alone, since the only child's parents are dead. And, as the title implies, every year they head to weddings looking for women to bed. They also make quite a scene at every wedding, assisting with the cutting of the cake, and making speeches to the bride and groom.But then comes the ""Kentucky Durby of weddings,"" Treasury Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken) is walking his oldest daughter down the aisle. The scene features walk-ons by Sen. John McCain and James Carville. The two buddies go in as ""brothers from New Hampshire,"" and things spiral out of control. John sets his sights for Claire Cleary, (Rachel McAdams), the middle child who is dating a selfish environmental lobbyist (Bradley Cooper, of ""Alias"" fame). Jeremy, who just wants to stick to the plan of the one-night stand, becomes the object of obsessive deflowered virgin Gloria Cleary (Ilsa Fisher, giving perhaps the most energetic performance of the film), not to mention the secretary's gay son, Todd. Mrs. Cleary (Jane Seymour) attempts to seduce John in a rather humiliating scene reminiscent of ""The Graduate."" Another hilarious addition is the secretary's foul-mouthed mother, who describes First-Lady Eleanor Roosevelt as being a dyke. Henry Gibson, as the meek Father is also a pleasure, not so much for what he says (since he has very few lines) but what he doesn't say, including listening to Vaughn give confession, ending with a mouth-to-mouth kiss to seal the deal.Vaughn and Fisher are a perfect romantic pair, because each one is just as crazy as the other, and as determined as she is to screw him, he's just as determined to keep away. Owen Wilson, more subdued than his co-star, actually shows a depth heretofore unseen in his character. Will Ferrell has an uncredited cameo as the entrepreneur who taught Vaughn how to crash weddings, a momma's boy who now gets his kicks crashing funerals.The references to bodily organs, sex, etc. are all fairly relevant in the context of the story, and not overdone. It's crude, but unlike ""Old School,"" stuff isn't just thrown in there because the writers couldn't think of anything genuinely funny to say.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
awesome movie!!!,"There's something for both the boys and the girls in this raucously funny romantic comedy by director David Dobkin. In fact the real chemistry happens between Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn as womanisers who crash weddings to pick up aspiring brides for one-night-stands - until one of them falls in love. Outrageous set-ups and saucy dialogue keep the party going and, while it staggers erratically to its conclusion, Wedding Crashers always has its heart in the right place.the movie was so cool,i have seen very rare movies rather none it was excellent.And all the actors and actresses(optional) did so well there dialogs acting methods of crashing all were good....i have not tried any one yet but soon.i wish those both owen and vince come again in any other movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This movie sucks big time.,"I really used to love Vince Vaughn. When he was in Swingers he was great. Since then he has only churned out rubbish. And this is a great big pile of it.This movie would have made me depressed about the mental status of contemporary society, but thankfully the audience I saw it with helped me keep my faith in humanity by not laughing once during the whole film (except one outburst of laughter from one guy at something that was so corny it was unintentionally funny).

Timeless Comedy Classic,"The chemistry and interplay between the two lead actors is brilliant and makes the Wedding Crashers a comedy classic. I will say I discovered Owen Wilson in this movie which has got to be his best turn. The same can be said for Vince Vaughn who is the hottest talent around period let alone this project. Lots of credit should go to the Director, great writers, and a superb supporting cast all of which helped to make this such a witty and entertaining showcase.The premise is well known by now and sure it could get somewhat predictable at a certain point, but what movie doesn't? There is a Hollywood formula that runs rampant in all motion pictures, this one is no different. However, you will certainly see enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes so to speak. I give it a 10 for sheer entertainment value alone, there is no competition for this movie - the hit of the summer bar none.I was not going to submit a review for this film but was compelled to after seeing it bashed one time too many and for no reason.

Wedding Crashers - Great movie...not just a guy's movie,"I was extremely surprised by this movie. When I saw the 40 year old virgin I thought that was just a huge guys movie and I had the same assumption of this movie....until I watched it.I laughed so hard at so many different points in this movie. The acting was great! I mean, how many times can Christopher Walken pull it off? He was superb! Probably the only sane member of that family The movie is about 2 buddies who like to crash weddings to meet girls, until one particular wedding that is crashed and both their worlds get a little weird when invited to stay with the bride's family for a weekend after the wedding.The gay brother, horny sister, psychotic boyfriend, drunk mother, hallucinating grandmother....where do they come up with this? It almost made me happy to think that my family is nothing like theirs.The movie was great, for women you get this really great inside look at just how desperate a guy is to sleep with you and for guys, well it's getting tips from Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson on how to get women to sleep with you.

Escapist fun with Messers Wilson and Vaughn,"""Wedding Crashers"" is a light comedy with a copious amount of slapstick and below-the-belt humour.

Your childhood puzzle masquerading as 'Wedding Crashers.',"Wedding Crashers: **.5* (2.5)'Wedding Crashers' stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as Jeremy Gray, and John Beckwith, two middle aged single men who have made a career out of crashing weddings to pick up women. Now, here is a movie that has garnered much praise and adoration, and has been hailed as one of the most hilarious comedies in years. Naturally, after so much praise and suggestions from others to see it, I gave it a go. Perhaps The praise it received led me to expect too much, or maybe it just really wasn't very good. Afterall, I went into 'Anchorman' and 'The 40 year old Virgin' with high expectations and found myself laughing out-loud. And its not like I expected a very good movie, just a funny one. So, what happened? 'Wedding Crashers' starts off with some nice little musical montages. They were fun, but alas, not really very funny. I kept waiting and hoping for some big laughs to start during the first half hour or so, but sadly they never showed up. I began to find myself growing bored. I almost tinkered with the thought of simply walking out, but, as movies are expensive, I chose to stay and push that thought away. I thought to myself, ""boy, these things really should be making me laugh. Whats going on here?"" I grinned a few times, but no laughs. The jokes are intentionally corny, but rather than a corniness that you laugh at, the jokes don't' have that edge or subtle comedy that previous work from Vaughan and crew had. Maybe it's just that we've seen these jokes done better before, and they feel too recycled to be funny anymore. Now don't' get me wrong, I laughed a few times, and there are a number of funny parts. My problem is that there should have been many more funny parts; parts that were there in which comedy shines through, but its as if you are looking at it through glass in an aquarium: You see it, but cannot touch it.As the movie progressed, I did find it funnier. The dinner scene in particular was quite funny, and a few other parts did make me laugh. The fact that Christopher Walken, who is in many respects a comedic timing master, and is hardly used is upsetting. Here is a man who, as Roger Ebert put it, could order pizza over the phone and make it a hilarious event. 'Wedding Crashers' has its moments, but ultimately falls short of its goal, whatever it was. Its clichéd heart is too clichéd to be sentimental or funny. The film ends up being that puzzle you tried to put together as a child which always had a missing piece. That missing piece keeps the picture from being whole and successful, and try as you might, you can never find where its been hidden. That childhood puzzle has been manifested as 'Wedding Crashers'- You can still see what the picture is without that piece, but its never as good as it should be with it. 5.5/10. A regrettable thumbs down.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wonderful wedding,"The wedding crashers features a fantastic cast and from the very first second the movie starts there is non stop laughter. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn do more than perform as the 'Crashers' John and Jeremy but are almost (only almost) outshone by the fantastic talents of Aussie actress Isla Fisher who plays her role as goofy yet lovable Gloria perfectly. And newcomer Racheal McAdams, who is fantastic as Claire Cleary. Vince gets the best lines but Owen will sure have you in stitches to, and as well as the actual comedy there is also hidden depth in there facial expressions and posture.

When I finally watched it I was kicking myself for not watching it sooner because it's hilarious and incredible! I love Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. They are a pretty good pair up but not quite as much chemistry as Owen and Chan in Shanghai nights (another amazing movie). I find wedding crashers humour hilarious and perfect to my taste. The movie is so bizarre but at the same time relatable. There's so much depth to the story so it never gets boring. I could watch it anytime and have a good time.

I can see why people think it's funny but I thought it was lame,"I can understand why people think that Vince's lunatic blatherings were hilarious. The problem I had was that while watching him, you can tell that he THOUGHT he was funny while spewing his rapid-fire lines, and it probably had the crew cracking up because the WORDS were funny - but in the end - you can see that HE wasn't buying it as a character. He was just being a guy spewing FUNNY words. His CHARACTER thought he was funny. That to me is NOT funny.Now Isla Fisher, playing the psycho-sexual Gloria, SHE was funny because her character was there all the way. She didn't let up once. She went all the way and did not come back.Walken delivered his lines as though he were a legendary actor who is feared by the delivery of unfunny lines. Not funny.Ferrell's appearance diminished my hopes of any serious comedy. Anyone casting him is going for 10 year old laughs and is not serious about delivering SERIOUS comedy.Since a movie is the sum of its parts and the parts that were good were few, I pull the the thumb out of my arse and give it a drippy thumbs down.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A funny comedy for a change,"Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson play friends and business partners that spend their summers crashing weddings so they can find an attractive female guest and sleep with them. They have characters and scenarios for themselves for each wedding and a long list of rules for how to properly crash a wedding and not get caught. Things change when they crash the wedding of one of the daughters of the secretary of the treasury played by Christopher Walken. Wilson falls hard for another daughter played by Rachel McAdams. Vaughn meanwhile slips away with yet another daughter, sleeps with her and then finds out too late that she's nuts. They get invited back to the family home for the weekend and accept because Wilson is trying to woo McAdams away from her lout of a fiancée. Wedding Crashers has some very funny scenes. Wilson and Vaughn work well together as friends and their interactions and banter at the weddings are fluid. The movie bogs down some with Wilson trying to win McAdams and everyone in the treasury secretary's family having a quirk to deal with. The ending also drags but overall this was a funny comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funniest movie I've seen in a while.,"This is probably the funniest movie I've seen lately, as well as the funniest Frat Pack film.The story is hilarious. Two men crash weddings so they can have sex with members of the wedding party, but at one wedding, one falls in love while the other is desperately trying to get away from a crazy person.The performances are good. Christopher Walken is always enjoyable, and Vince Vaughn is at his funniest. Owen Wilson was funny in his role, and Rachel McAdams proves her acting versatility.At times it turns to bathroom humour, but what comedy doesn't do that nowadays? Probably the funniest film of 2005.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
You know what you're going to get,"I think those reviewers suggesting that this movie is the next ANIMAL HOUSE are going a little over the top but, nevertheless, it's constantly amusing, has enough laugh-out-loud moments and for those who need their fix of keeper quotes, it's got more than handful of those. ""Stage 5 clinger"" is definitely working its way into my conversation at some point.It's Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughan. You know what they do and you know the price of the ticket before you go in. However much you liked their other movies is probably about how much you'll like this one. I found DODGEBALL slapstick-funnier but this one has put more effort into the main characters and the relationship between them. Even knowing it was a Wilson / Vaughan comedy, I still was a little moved by John's plight at the funeral scene.Go with your mates or your boy/girlfriend. Don't expect to be enlightened and have a good stream of chuckles.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
