enjoyable,"It is true that this film is not like others Pixar films.But it is not acctualy so bad.Many review-writers is telling that this film is huge disappointment,and I think it is not true.I think that expectations was too big.So,this is story about cars.About one friendship.They are completely different,but they are best friends.There is lot of nice,simple humor in the story.The scenario is ""smooth"" and it is easy watchable.There are much of action,surprises,cool techniques,like in James Bond. Yes,we could not expect that,but it is really OK .The characters are in many different places and they are meeting a different people.Characters are 3D,they have feelings and we feel empathy about them.But,there is a ""dark side"" of film,which is not like Pixar.Enemies,propaganda and that stuff.These problems confuses and my 10 year old brother.It is not ugly or violent,it is just confusing to kids.About animation,I will not discuss.It is still Pixar;great animations and visuals and everything about it.This is family film and it is really relaxing and enjoyable.Maybe sometimes is confusing,but it is not acctualy so bad.Because of action and messages that film gives: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not As Good As the First But Still Good.,"I know I'm WAY late on this by over a year. Overall I liked it. Loved a lot of the new characters, especially Finn McMissile and the arrogant Italian car guy (whatever his name was). Liked Raoue Carole as well. I just had two major pet peeves with it: it focused on Mater. Mater already had his own little spin-off of ""Mater's Tall Tales"" which I love. A movie centered on him just didn't do it for me. Had it been on Lightning (like the first one) or any other character I would have been okay. It may have to do with the fact that I'm no Mater fan. My second beef was Doc Hudson wasn't in it. I know why, I understand wanting to honor Paul Newman (whom I adored), hate to sound callous, but the show goes on. If he ended up with a different voice then so be it. Better yet, he could have been in it for a few seconds, and just not say anything at all. Fillmore's voice actor passed and he was still in it so to me there was no excuse not to have Doc in it. My two cents, of course.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A Great Summer Film, that the whole family can enjoy","We all know that Pixar makes incredible movies, I personally have never disliked a Pixar film. The first ""Cars"" film, was a great movie, not a perfect film. It was one of the least better films, Pixar has made, but that's like saying, Insomnia was one of Christopher Nolan's worst films. I had high expectations when coming to see the film, like I always have before I see a Pixar film.After my viewing of the film, I have to say Pixar never fails to produce a great, entertaining film. Although it doesn't reach the heights of Wall-E, Toy Story 3, etc. It still stands by itself pretty high up there. The animation is extremely well done, the look of the film is amazing. The voice actors are great, I miss Paul Newman though. Although the film is not perfect. The movie is not perfect though, the story is not great, but not bad, the movie does not have the emotional as other Pixar films, but it is definitely not a heartless film. But the film is definitely entertaining and a great beginning to 2011 Summer movie season. Take your whole family to see this movie, it will probably not disappoint. It will not only satisfy kids, but also the adults, this film is for everyone. Fun for kids, but the adults can also connect with it and will have a great time watching this movie in theaters. It is quite an adventure and I will be glad to give it a second viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not what my kids and I expected...,"Espionage, assassinations, sabotage of renewable energy, propaganda, corporate cover-ups, media manipulation and The Mob...James Bond? Nope. Jason Bourne? Nope.Disney/Pixar's CARS 2. Wow. This movie wasn't at all what I was expecting. In the second serving of Lightning McQueen and his pals, they take their show to the international stage in a world championship race-off sponsored by oil-alternative manufacturer, Allinol. But turmoil behind the scenes pulls the gang into a world of spies, the Mob, Big Oil, evil German scientists and hit men. Now they have to save the world before it's too late. Oh, and they race too. The animation is amazing. Water, large balloons, backgrounds during races...pay attention because the quality of the graphics in this one are world-class. There are some goofy, funny moments and some nice one- liners for the older crowd. The themes of being true to yourself and bonds of friendship run strong throughout this film but it's the remainder of the message that worried me. There were non-stop put downs throughout and some other questionable topics. I was beginning to question the G rating when the villain ordered his henchmen to ""kill"" several other cars. Thinking back to the innocence and the good spirit of the first movie, I began to wonder how we got from there to here. Adventures in racing take a back-seat to the more mature plot of an espionage thriller. Looking around the theater, I could tell that kids younger than 4 or 5 were beginning to get lost. Even my ten-year-old had a hard time understanding the socio-political messages. On top of all that, I'd be willing to bet that Cars 2 is a contender for most guns, explosions and bullets fired in a G-Rated movie. This movie had much more violence than the first one.Aside from the appropriateness of the movie, it wasn't bad. All the likable characters from the first movie were back with bigger roles like 'Mater & Luigi and there were many new characters added that also brought their own personalities into the mix. To me, this was an espionage-thriller so the added bonus of some comedy made the movie move right along at a good pace.It was engaging for me, I enjoyed it, but the entire time I couldn't help but wonder why Disney/Pixar chose to tell this story through a kids movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Such a disappointment,"16 years ago, Pixar Animation Studios released the first feature length computer animated film in history, Toy Story. What followed was an incredible run of success, an 11 film hot streak that yielded dozens of awards (including 11 Oscars), billions of dollars in box office receipts, and the admiration of audiences and critics everywhere. Year after year Pixar was a company you could rely on, and while not all the films were perfect, they all were at least of decent quality, and light years ahead of their competition from the likes of Dreamworks and Sony. So therefore it's heart-breaking to say that Pixar's hot streak has come to a crashing halt in 2011. Cars 2 is not just the weakest film in Pixar's catalogue, it is the worst high-profile animated release for some time.If there is one Pixar film that divides opinion much more than any other, it is 2006's Cars. While by no means a bad film, it just didn't hit in the same way as films like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, or The Incredibles. It did middling numbers at the box office (by Pixar standards) and currently sits with a 74% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the only film from the studio below 90%. For director John Lasseter (also head of Pixar), Cars is obviously a very personal film, a nostalgic story about the loss small-town American values in the face of increased modernity. If it's not a complete success, credit must be given to Lasseter for at least trying to say something meaningful, and in typical Pixar fashion the film stands out in the increasingly crowded computer animation film market for at least attempting thematic depth, and it's ability to reach audiences both young and old. Cars 2 on the other hand is completely devoid of depth and subtlety, and will more than likely annoy adults while at times being arguably inappropriate for children. Returning director Lasseter takes the worst character from the first film (in my opinion the biggest reason for Cars' failure), and structures the whole story around his infuriating exploits. Imagine George Lucas, upon seeing the negative feedback following The Phantom Menace, making all of Episode 2 about Jar-Jar Binks. That's the kind of thing we're left with in Cars 2. Compounding the story problems is the troubling amount of guns and violence in the film. To make the argument that 'it's OK because they're just cars' is inexcusable. This is still supposed to be a children's film, and while the espionage sub-plot does have potential, there are elements that seem shockingly unsuitable for young kids.This brings up a question: why would Pixar choose to revisit the only film they have produced which could conceivably be called a failure? Lasseter is on record as saying that the company would only explore sequels to their films if a good story could be developed, and the level of quality of the two Toy Story sequels seems to back up this sentiment, but it's hard to believe that anyone would think the script of Cars 2 is worthy of that high standard. Interestingly, there is one other way that Cars stands apart from other Pixar films: the estimated $8 billion merchandising revenues. While all Pixar films have profited from merchandising, none have had the global appeal of Cars. It's upsetting to think that Pixar, a company who seemed previously to place greater importance on the quality of its films than the bottom line, have gone for the easy cash grab, but there really seems to be no other reason for the existence of Cars 2. Everything about the films seems designed to increase the potential for selling merchandise, whether it's the films global locations which pander to international audiences, or the increasingly ridiculous characters and set-pieces, tailor made to be toys and video games. It's a cynical opinion, one which I had hoped I'd never feel towards a Pixar film, but it is undeniably true: Cars 2 is a film created not as an artistic endeavour, but to feed ancillary markets.Pixar's golden run had to end sometime, and one bad film is a small price to pay for 11 good, with two or three being genuine masterpieces. What is most unfortunate is the catastrophic level of Cars 2's failure, and Pixar will undoubtedly lose a lot of respect for making such a soulless film, unworthy of the studio's name.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Flawed but still enjoyable,"The best of Pixar's films have protagonists who are a small part of a very large world and are almost helpless against incredible odds - Toy Story, Wall-E, Finding Nemo etc. The protagonists of Cars are very big in a very small world, so do not play to the strengths of Pixar.However, being Pixar, they still make these films better than anyone else would have with the same material. Cars and Cars 2 are intelligently written and filled with more detail than you could comfortably fit into a single screening.This movie is not so much a sequel to the first as an affectionate James Bond parody that happens to be set in the Cars universe. Whereas the original Cars was thematically slow and patient, this one deliberately takes things in the exact opposite direction. Whether anyone will prefer the first film or the second is entirely their preference, and it is wrong to say that one is better than the other. Each film has its own appeals and drawbacks.The main weakness of this film is a failure to create any kind of sympathy for the characters. They are not alone, they are not lost, they have friends and allies and the resources to get out of any situation. It never feels like there is any real danger, as there is with the Toy Story films. Whereas the first film had enough focus on character development to compensate for this, the subplot about the tested friendship between McQueen and Mater seems especially insubstantial here.Nevertheless, I feel like this is an enjoyable installment in the franchise, never letting your attention wander and always ready with a clever idea. They have demonstrated that they are willing to go in entirely new directions with this world - maybe if they make a third film, they can make something truly worthy of the Pixar name?If I were rating this in comparison to other Pixar films, my score would be lower... but scoring this as a film on its own, I think it is deserving of between five and seven stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
How the Mighty have Fallen,"We hoped it would never happen, but no one is perfect. Even the best can stumble. This had to happen eventually. Even the string of terrific Disney's classic films and the 90s Disney Renaissance didn't last forever. I'm afraid that, yes, Pixar has made a bad film.Cars 1 was their least ambitious film. The story was predictable and character development obvious making it their most mediocre film. It was good but it lacked that little extra touch that made their films great. However, they had some great side characters, a heart, and wonderful scenes that elevated it up beyond most other films. But ever since this film's announcement I always wondered why. McQueen had his story and there's not much else to tell. Like Finding Nemo, where else is there to go? And I'd rather see sequels to better movies like The Incredibles, even Bug's Life seems to have more potential. It's easy to see why they made a sequel to it, since all you need to do is go to Disneyland or any Disney Store and see it covered in McQueen and Mater, which happened to be two my of three year-old cousin's first words. Off all the Pixar films, Cars made the most with the merchandise.The biggest problem is the story. Cars 1, while predictable, was touching. Cars 2 has almost no heart or character development. The focus shifts from McQueen to Mater. McQueen had his story in the first and there's little to tell here. He has one character moment that's essentially the same realization as the first film's. The problem with Mater is that he's such a simple character. Everything about him is on the surface for all to see. He's the same person throughout the movie, with one predictable realization which goes no where, that he doesn't warrant his own film. He's like Kronk from The Emperor's New Groove. They're both terrific side characters but lack enough complexity for a full story. And Larry the Cable Guy has always been better with the other Blue Collar guys rather than on his own.While Cars 1's highlight was its side characters, this movie almost abandons them. They do nothing. McMissile is a moving plot device and little more. Shiftwell is supposed to be a love interest but lacks any interesting moments. The rest of Radiator Springs basically sit back while McQueen and Mater have all the fun. Their stories and character are pushed aside so Larry can have fun being Mater. Because of this, there are almost no funny little side scenes where characters just have fun being themselves. Instead, most of the humor is derived from seeing Mater do silly things.The look is impressive but not more than anything else Pixar's done. With each movie, the studio has pushed the graphics into new levels. Each movie has had some wow moment where audiences can't help but be amazed by what they're seeing. There were times in Cars 1 when it looked almost real. Cars 2 lacks any wow factor. One of the most impressive sets, Tokyo, were already spoiled by the Tokyo Mater short. This more than anything makes me wonder if Pixar was even trying to up the ante or if they were just using what they had to make a movie a year.Spies and Cars seems to work well together. After all, any Bond or Bourne film will easily demonstrate why the two go together. Indeed, the opening scene on the drilling platform is easily the best with the fast chase and cool gadgets. But they weren't able to properly combine the racing and spy elements, almost as if you're watching two movies at once. There's too much spy stuff for the racing to be interesting, which becomes pointless against the overpowering and overly clichéd spy story. Perhaps Pixar should have set it as simply a spy movie set in the Cars universe and had McQueen and his friends in cameos or as a background story.Another lousy spot is the music. Cars 1 had a terrific soundtrack with excellent uses of popular songs like Life is a Highway and Route 66. But there's not one memorable song or music cue in this movie. Giacchino usually does terrific work like with The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and Up. But he too fumbles the ball here. Perhaps he was just uninspired by what he had to work with.Cars is Lasseter's pet project. But I think he's too close to it. He's got that Lucas Star Wars prequel trilogy problem. The people around him either were in awe of the man who made Pixar and Toy Story or they were afraid to hurt his feelings since he loves the Cars franchise so much. Pixar efforts have been so well done because they were collaborative efforts, each fixing each other's problems to make a better project. But with Lasseter off working more directly with Disney, he really should have had a co-director or perhaps given the reins to someone else like he did with Toy Story 3.I almost rated this movie higher. It is fun while you're watching it, even if as soon as it's over it becomes too easy to pick apart the problems. But this is Pixar. They've dominated the animation market since Toy Story and have been pushing the boundaries at the Academy Awards ever since. To see them stumble with a not-so-great film would be one thing. But they're coming off from two Best Picture nominees to a movie that's simply flashy but with little substance. Kids will love the bright colors and silly antics, but parents will hate having to then buy twelve new Mater toys. Cars 2 is stalled and in need of a tune-up.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Underrated masterpiece,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Cars 2. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of car mechanics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Mater's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Cars 2 truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Lighting McQueen's existential catchphrase ""Kachow"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Pixar's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂And yes, by the way, i DO have a Lighting McQueen tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Hang up the Hawaiian shirt, Lasseter, you've sold out.","As an ardent fan of the first Cars, I was shocked at what an absolute mess this movie is. I was prepared for a certain level of disappointment from the trailers, but I didn't expect the sheer second-rate train wreck that is this movie. All the heart of the first film has been chucked out the window on the way to cashing in on merchandising possibilities.McQueen has been practically relegated to minor character status here (one wonders why Owen Wilson even bothered showing up). Occasional glimmers of clever humor are all but eclipsed by a rickety plot that can't bear the weight of all it's trying to accomplish. Mater's hi-jinx as the centerpiece of a ridiculous (and unfunny) spy plot go from annoying to disturbing as the violence ratchets up. While several critics have claimed this sequel is aimed at particularly young audiences, no other children's movie you're likely to see in the near future does more to glorify gun violence.Pixar has sucked all the dimensionality out of every returning character, and the new ones it's added are so one-dimensional as to be nonexistent. This is a pathetic offering from a studio that should know better.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Something's Missing,"The saddest thing about Pixar today is, they don't know what movie they are going to release on their 25th Anniversary since one of their upcoming projects ""Newt"" was cancelled despite from Blue Sky's Rio plot. Cars 2 feels like it's a direct-to-DVD film. It's not really bad but it's just unnecessary. Though, the action is pretty cool. The kids will enjoy it but the rest is like Rango. Instead of Western Themes, it's Spy movies. The story isn't bad except it doesn't give anything emotional and heartwarming unlike the other Pixar movies. Cars 2 is pretty fun but the most important ingredient of their movies is missing.Firstly, the lead of the film is Mater. The theme of the film is Espionage but it's just some sort of an animated version of a particular spy movie. Everything moves here. There are too many action that any kid can enjoy but the story is probably too interesting for grown ups. If the movie gets focused to the plot, the kids might get bored. The missing Pixar element here is the heartwarming moments. The movie still has a heart but it fails to be compelling. Don't worry about the humor, that is one thing they will never fail. Some of the writing seems rushed.The voices do what they do best. John Lasseter knows what to do in this movie. The animation is obviously pretty good. The score is a bit generic that you may hear in any movie or television show. The action keeps everything moving. Watching the car fighting scenes is like watching a kid playing his little toy cars and let them do something fun. Which is pretty impressive.In Pixar, the craftsmanship or the animation doesn't quite matter. It's all about the compelling story and the emotional heartwarming moments. It's hard to say Cars 2 is bad film. Pixar still knows how to make a good movie but without their important elements, it's like you're watching a movie from a different studio. Once again, it's pretty fun but if you expect a lot of Pixar magic then you might get disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not the best of Pixar,"I enjoy kids movies, I really do. But this fails to deliver a great story. Cars was a good movie with a great plot. But Cars 2 was a mix of stories. The sequels are never like the first one and this is not the exception.The cars aren't developed enough to care about them. Mater(Larry the cable guy) fails. He was funny at the first one but now he is simply annoying.International espionage? Really? I Don't think that was a good idea for the plot. The 3-D is kinda useless like it happen with Kung Fu Panda 2.

This is not a Pixar Movie.,"When I go to see a Pixar movie I expect to be blown away. Cars 2 simply did not. There were many problems with Cars 2, mainly that the story strength just was not there. Yes it did have some funny moments but they were few and far between. The main problem with this movie however was that Pixar made Mater, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, the main character. After 20 minutes into the movie I wanted to leave because of how annoying he was. Larry is annoying as a human, making him a the main character as a car is just stupid. It was honestly the only Pixar movie so far that I left feeling completely nothing. What a disappointment this was as this topped my summer movie list.

What turns out to be a series of potentially deadly situations throws Mater into a fast-paced world of secrecy, gadgets, guns, disguises and heroics. It's James Bond meets the original Cars, in this film packed with racing, romance and rendezvous. A fun flick for the whole family to enjoy!",,Anonymous,Animation
"Mater may be a good Sidekick, but a good Lead he is not!","""Cars 2"" is an unusual case of a highly anticipated film that was not simultaneously released here locally as in the States. I wonder why? Anyway after I watched this film, I think I know why. For all the positive goodwill that the first Cars film had, this film was a relative disappointment.I will not knock the artwork. This definitely maintains the high standards that elevate all Pixar films with regards to quality of animation. The racing and hi-jinx spy sequences done in familiar landmark locales all over the world were all very excellently rendered. There was action in the roads, underwater and the skies. This time we get to see talking boats and planes, aside from just the titular cars.For me the problem was with the story. I think the complex spy story that underlies this installment, and the highfalutin spy lingo it uses, flies over the comprehension of the young kiddie audience it caters to. I do not think kids would fully understand about the issues on alternative fuels or on ""lemon"" cars. These ""adult"" issues that motivate the villains' violent actions will make it hard for kids to really get the story without parental explanation. I think it was not too cool to see cars being ""killed"" in some very violent scenes. I do not think it was a good idea to kids to see their gentle favorite Mater with rocket boosters and machine guns.Contrary to most expectations, Lightning McQueen is NOT the hero of Cars 2. The central character in this one is Mater, whom we knew as the loyal sidekick. Unfortunately, for me at least, Mater did not cut it as leading man. His awkward country bumpkin demeanor and hick-town country drawl were only funny from the side, but was rather hard to take when it was front and center most of the time.After Mater, the cars with more screen time than McQueen were British spy cars Finn McMissile and Holley Shiftwell. While they were both quintessentially cool British secret agents, they also blow the beloved ""heart and soul"" of the first Cars movie out of this film's focus. You hardly even see Sally and the rest of the Radiator Springs gang. It was also that the focus of the whole film was more the ""James Bond""-like spy story, while the races were merely incidental.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dazzling and charming!,"I knew I would like this film, but I was very pleasantly surprised at how amazing I found it. As a hold-out and a bit of a cranky git, I confess I am one of those who find the 3D experience an annoyance. Maybe if they someday come up with a contraption-free (no glasses) way to see it, I might like it. My cinema only had it in 3D. Drat.However, the 3D annoying gimmick aside- I was thrilled by the lush beauty of this movie. I was also gratified by the depth and meaningful quality of the story. Recounting the plot here would not accomplish anything, so I'll skip it. Let us say that if the outcomes of all the plot points were probably predictable, that's OK--- As a ""comedy"" that is the formula- and it was well served.I was entranced throughout.Emily Mortimer's solid feminine sweetness and likability came through- and Michael Cain was a hoot. And the skillful comedic actor Eddie Izzard's characterisation was also true to his particular form. The cast from the first Cars film all seemed to be here as well- to good effect.I will note that this did not seem like a film made for small children at all. My auditorium was filled with the little guys- a cute and amiable crew, to be sure. But I cannot imagine that they would find the characters and the intricate story intelligible. And the jaw-droppingly beautiful scenery and artwork would also likely be lost on them.I loved this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Out the Heart, In the Fun","Cars 2 may be one of Pixar's weakest, but that's certainly the biggest weakness of them all.In the latest installment, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is getting ready for a worldwide competition, the World Grand Prix, and takes his old pal Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) with him to the opening race. A turn of events gets Mater caught up in a secret spy mission, led by Finn McMissile and Holley Shiftwell, to stop the ""lemon"" cars from initiating an attach against new electric oil, Allinol, for their more profitable and less eco-savvy crude oil reserves. Sounds like a high concept story for a kids film, but Cars 2 succeeds, because it doesn't ever treat it's audience like their in a childlike fantasy that the characters would otherwise seem to make up.With big eyes, and cars with mouths, it's the most ridiculous (and adolescent) of Pixar's features, and yet the rest of the animation is stunning; the flashy, high-energy kinetic vibe of Tokyo to the dreamy Italian landscape, all of the animation in this film is stunning; i would daresay some of Pixar's best. This film, unlike many other sequels, actually attempts something new. It brings a whole new definition to the previously established series, this time accenting the youth-obsessed sports car age, both with the James Bond-esque plot and the eco-savvy thematic conflicts. It's high voltage, and it's a whole lot of fun. The pacing is non- stop and the action sequences are done brilliantly. That being said, what it makes of thrills and action, it sags in emotional heart and laughs.Though the film banks on current environmental arguments to delve into the theme of being proud of who you truly are and the value of friendship, it it loses the depth of the film in the action that we have come to expect from Pixar. In fact, having seen Pixar's other films is the weakest aspect. You know how good they can be, so to see them not on their A-game (I would call it at least a B-game), many critics took it down. But even though it's animation outshines it's emotional core, it's a whole lot of fun. B+",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bad!,"This animated film is neither for children nor for adults. Bad screenplay, violent, cliché till extreme, this film is the complete confusion. It's too long, boring and pointless 3D CG cartoon. My six-year old daughter asked me to leave the cinema, because she was bored. Decline of Pixar in the quality screenplay began with Ratatouille, through UP and Toy Story 3, the fall turned into the nosedive with this one. To say this is the bad movie is a compliment. The concept of a spy movie like a 007, which itself is outdated, has totally missed the target for the younger viewers, who expect humor, joy and laughter.

I personally like the spy car theme as car chases are prominent in many spy movies. I do not think it is a far cry from the first movie, radiator springs is not forgotten it is just worked into McQueen's life.

In the end it is still a Pixar movie, worth watching, and far better than most of the movies in the theaters right now.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Highly and Thoroughly Disappointing,"I have to say that I was completely disappointed by this movie. When I first read about the plot two years ago, I didn't think that a race around the world and having Larry the Mater Guy being mistaken for an international spy would work, but since it was being done by Pixar, and John Lasseter in particular, I'd give it a chance.Unfortunately, my intuition was right.First of all, I thought this movie was way too violent for a G rating (see the bathroom scene where the American agent car gets beaten up for example). I suppose I should have thought twice when I saw a toy Larry the Mater Guy truck with machine guns in my local grocery store.Secondly, why was Owen Wilson even given top billing for his role as Lightning McQueen? He was a secondary character at best. The first movie was about relationships and finding what's important in life, and so on. This movie? Merchandising.Third, Larry the Mater Guy cannot carry a movie on his own (animated, pixellated or otherwise). His actions were funny for the first five minutes or so, but come on here. This whole ""fish out of water"" stuff (or, in this case, hayseed in the big city) wears thin quickly.Fourth, can we please get OFF the ""big oil is bad"" bandwagon, at least for kids movies? Aren't they being brainwashed enough? A kids movie is supposed to be a kids movie, plain and simple. Fun, lighthearted, and entertaining. Maybe even a song thrown in here and there. They don't need to be sent a message just yet. Let them be kids for crying out loud. Let them discover Michael Moore when they're in high school.The movie did have, however, a few redeeming qualities. As usual, Pixar creates a highly detailed, richly defined, visually appealing world for both the characters and audience. John Turturro hams it up as the Italian Formula-1 racer. Michael Caine never disappoints (Jaws 4 notwithstanding).But all you need to know about this movie is what my five year old son did when it was over. He is, presumably, in the target audience for a G rated film, and is a huge fan of the first movie. When the movie was over, he stood up and (literally) yelled, ""I don't like this movie!"" Enough said.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lots of shooting and destruction,"I am a HUGE fan of the original and have watched it over a 100 times with my youngest son (He would take his Cars cars and re-enact scenes with the movie playing). I was thrilled to see Pixar making a sequel. However, I have to say this one is much darker and has much more action and plays a lot like a spy movie or an episode of Burn Notice or Covert Affairs. I really enjoyed this as a movie and not as a sequel. It is visually superb and has a good message of friendship. However, I found that it just didn't quite have the charm of the first. Don't get me wrong, it's a really good movie and if you watch it without expecting a sappy sequel and go in with an open mind, you'll have a blast!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointingly Mediocre,"Pixar Studios makes the best animation films out there, and they've been showing over and over again their elaborateness when making them. Sadly I saw that CARS 2 seemed more like a machinery for money, than a movie with an actual heart. The plot is thin and sadly uninspired, and the actions herein revolves around fast-paced dialog and fire and explosions. The original CARS had charm and atmosphere, and although it wasn't the best piece of Pixar, it had an all-and-all good standard. CARS 2 doesn't have it, and I found myself missing all the good contents that has become trademarks of Pixar's films. This may be a new low for the company and crew, so one can only hope that they'll bounce back and show us that they've still got it.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
An action-filled fun change of pace,"Sometimes you go to a Pixar movie and get a deeply insightful, heart-tugging classic that sings to the deepest corners of the human condition.And sometimes you go to a Pixar movie for some uncomplicated fun and adventure.""Cars 2"" is unapologetically the latter; it never reaches the emotional depths of ""Up"" or ""Toy Story 3"", but it never tries to be. Instead, this is a family-friendly action-packed adventure movie, the kind of movie you watch because you just want to sit back and enjoy the spectacle. Whether it's the gorgeous scenery, the breakneck chase sequences, or Finn McMissile's never-ending arsenal of cool gadgets, ""Cars 2"" is a movie that simply wants you to have fun as you follow along with its whirlwind escapades.Some might feel this is a disappointment from Pixar, but I think that's being unfair -- after all, no one begrudges Steven Spielberg for producing both ""Schinder's List"" and ""Indiana Jones"".""Cars 2"" isn't high art, but it never tries to be.

Cars 2 is a Good movie,"I am in the minority that enjoy the movie. It has some funny moments, a great soundtrack, and well done action scenes that are possible in Cars series. I belive that if the film was labeled as a spinoff then a sequel, I think people will have a more positive reception by fans as they will not have a anger about how it doesn't follow up the previous movie, heck Mater is the main character of this movie.However I see the movie for what it is, including my father who loves this movie and we usually associate it as ""the Mater movie"" then Cars 2.

Cars 2,"You know, I think I preferred this to the original.

Meantime, unbeknown to our shiny red American, the suave and debonaire ""Finn McMissile"" is doing his best ""007"" impersonation investigating a network of international espionage that would make ""Spectre"" look amateur. Together with his assistant ""Miss Shiftwell"" they soon conclude that their fate is mixed with not just ""Lightning"" but with poor old ""Mater"" - who takes pride in every dent he has acquired to his rusting bodywork over his time with his champion friend. There's loads going on, and unlike the first of this series - I found this to be a much more engaging story with a greater international dynamic to it. The Aston Martin and the Citroën, the Ferrari and the tow truck - all reinforcing the messages of team playing and loyalty as the mystery deepens and ""Lightning"" and ""McMissile"" have to race to save the trusty old rust-bucket from a fate worse than a magnetic crusher.

The cars movie is definitely a must see.,"I agree with what the first reviewer has said. The movie was all too focused with Mater.

for an animation movie is great for a Pixar movie is just OK,"As many people mentioned before Cars is a movie that didn't deserved a sequel. I mean, talking cars is not the best idea to start with but somehow they managed to bring some emotions in part one. I remember that I was a little bored with the slow pace of the first Cars, but again they tried to connect the audience with the characters ( in my opinion McQueen is not a likable one). In the end Cars was good but it was missing something. Now, the sequel goes a completely different way, and first I thought that was a good and original move, but I also think that Mater has a lot of time on screen and frankly that is annoying ( it is the typical character that always screw things off but hey we love him because he has a big big heart and he will never let his friend down come on¡¡¡ that is so childlish and its okay for the kids, but we know that Pixar has made it to the top because they connect with kids and adults equally.

Worst Pixar Movie. PERIOD.,"I love Pizar. Since the original Toy Story debuted I have religiously gone to opening weekend to watch every new release, and have never been disappointed. Until now.I took my 2 1/2 year old daughter to see what I naturally believed would be another great family flick. Instead she spent half the movie looking away and the other half saying ""ouchie"" as the violence ripped across the screen. I truly felt bad that I subjected her to it as I kept telling myself this is a Pixar film it will get better.About the halfway point in the flick when Pixar officially sold out to State Farm Insurance and gave them their own line I realized this movie would be past redemption, but I got my $5 matinée worth and stuck it out. This is my first review and I cannot emphasize enough to other parents out there DO NOT take your child to see this movie, it is a mish mash of a storyline about being yourself and defeating big oil and loving State Farm all thrown into one.2 out of 10 only because there is a great bathroom scene in Japan that showed there was a little bit of Pixar thrown into the film.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fairly enjoyable,"Starting where the previous one left of we meet Lightning McQueen completely settled and living in Radiator Springs. Life is good - there's racing events to be won and the company of friends to be enjoyed. During a race event in Japan the wheels of fate are set in motion and McQueen and Mater end up in what can only be described as a cloak and dagger operation. So far for the story.Animation wise there's nothing too wrong with this film - the style is much the same as the first one. Most of the scenes are busy - there's always something to look at, some detail to pick out. Story wise I felt the film was aimed at an audience a bit older than the one for the previous film although the number of young kids in the theatre enjoying themselves proved it didn't matter.3D effects were far under the expectancy level for an animation film. I don't think anyone would miss them if they weren't there at all and that makes this film another proof that the 3D addition to film is one that is to be worked at some more or removed completely.All in all it is a fairly enjoyable film with a good number of cultural effects and lots of laughs.6 out of 10 sources of intelligence",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, but Disappointing","In the past two years, Pixar has had movies that were nominated for best picture awards. This year, they probably won't. Cars 2 is completely different than any other Pixar film, even Cars. It is not here to tell a story. It is here to just have a fun time at the theater. The first half of the movie is the best part, giving you the action and comedy expected from the trailers. After the first half, it seems to slow down and drag. Without a deep story, this seems like it was just made to keep up with the length of other Pixar films. The story contains mainly Mater, which isn't too much of a problem, but it does seem to get old after a little while. The racing is barely there, so it is like John Lasseter said, a spy movie with cars. As a Pixar fan, it disappointed. Even though Cars is my least favorite Pixar film, it was still good. This is at the same level, but nothing like Cars. There is almost no lesson learned from this. This a movie to enjoy, not a masterpiece like the rest of Pixar's films.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Feels like a bad Saturday morning hangover; Pixar has definitely run low on gas!,"'CARS 2': Two Stars (Out of Five)Pixar Studio's 12th animated feature, and without a doubt it's all time low point, is this sequel to the 2006 hit original. Another tale of the adventures of Lightning McQueen and buddy Mater in a world of all living cars and other automobiles. John Lasseter (who also directed the original and first two 'TOY STORY' films) returned to direct the film (his first time doing so since the film's predecessor five years ago) with newcomer Brad Lewis. It was written by Lasseter, Lewis, Dan Fogelman and Ben Queen. The film is only the third sequel Pixar has released (after the second and third 'TOY STORY' films) but many more are planned. This is not a good sign by the looks of 'CARS 2'. Hopefully this was just a speed bump but it was not a good film by any means and by no measure lived up to the previous standards set by the respectable studio.The film picks up with race car Lightning McQueen (once again voiced by Owen Wilson) returning home to his hometown of Radiator Springs after a successful racing trip. His best friend, the tow truck named Mater (once again voiced by Larry the Cable Guy), is overjoyed to see him. After spending a day together catching up Mater quickly becomes jealous when McQueen wants to spend time with his girlfriend Sally (Bonnie Hunt reprising her role) alone. He then gets heated up when he hears a cocky Grand Prix race car named Francesco (John Tuturro) boasting how he could easily take McQueen in any race, on TV. Mater calls up the news show and challenges the race car which leads to McQueen entering the Grand Prix and taking Mater along with him. Once there Mater becomes involved in an espionage adventure (through a classic movie mistaken identity scenario) and teams up with two spies (voiced by Michael Caine and Emily Mortimer).The film does have a positive message about friendship and being true to yourself regardless of how others treat you because of it, as well as an environmental message about alternative fuel sources, but it seems tacked on and forced. The rest of the movie is a pain to get through to get to it and not quality entertainment for anyone (of any age). I was extremely bored and annoyed by the film and I could tell most others in the theater I was seeing it in were as well. Kids were crying and being antsy and parents were moaning and constantly yawning. The film barely got any laughs or signs of positive emotion from anyone in the theater that I could tell. The magic just wasn't there like with other Pixar films. The movie is loud, clanky and simply put a mess. The characters are underwritten and the story barely holds together for it's nearly two hour running time. Nothing about the film works. It feels like a bad Saturday morning hangover. All except for the visuals, the visuals are still grade A but for the money spent on the film ($200 million) they should be a lot better. Pixar definitely has run low on gas, at least for the time being. Hopefully it can get a jump start.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHRJKrR2Lk",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Disappointing, But By No Means Bad","So this is a hard review to write. On one hand, Cars 2 is better than 95% of what any other animation studio is putting out (that five percent is home to the odd DreamWorks movie that is actually great like How to Train Your Dragon, and one-off successes from great filmmakers like Henry Selick's ""Coraline"" and Gore Verbinski's ""Rango""), but on the other hand it's a significant step down from the excellence bordering on perfection we've come to expect from Pixar. True, a step down from excellence is still good, but considering the pedigree it's somewhat disappointing; therein lies my quandary.Cars 2 tells a broader story than the original Cars, taking place in many locales across four different countries. In Cars 2 Lightning McQueen has just come back from a Piston Cup race and is getting ready to settle down after the end of Racing Season, but all the while invitations are being sent for a World Grand Prix, a tournament across three different countries featuring the world's best racers and McQueen is invited. He takes Mater along for the ride and through a series of coincidences Mater eventually gets mistaken for an American Spy by British Intelligence Agent Finn McMissile (think James Bond voiced by Michael Caine). High speed races and spy movie action set pieces ensue, and there are many fun moments and good laughs along the way. The visuals are stunning, as are to be expected with Pixar, and the voice work is just as wonderful as it always is in a Pixar film (Michael Caine absolutely steals the show). However, there are elements that hold it back from greatness.The whole affair feels very safe and almost unambitious, there's nothing in the film that really wowed me and while I enjoyed myself the movie never really gripped me like other Pixar films do. As a member of the audience, I felt like I was just watching a movie rather than being caught up in a story, the characters were fun, but I never connected with them in the same way I've connected with Woody, Marlin, Flik, Carl Fredricksen, or WALL-E; I didn't even connect with Lightning McQueen or Mater in the same way I did in the first film. They were entertaining characters, but they just didn't have that same spark of life that makes them feel real. It didn't have the same magic that I've come to expect from Pixar.Again, this is my problem. Looking at what I've written, I keep comparing it to other Pixar films and not looking at it on its own merit. It doesn't necessarily seem right to hold Cars 2 accountable for Toy Story 2, Ratatouille, and WALLE; completely on its own merit Cars 2 is a fun, entertaining film with great visuals and good characters. I can think of much worse ways to spend a Friday night, and I would definitely be willing to see it again. However, that comparison is inevitable due to the fact that Pixar has established such a strong precedent of not just quality, but excellence over the past 25 years. As a follow up to 11 of the best films of the past decade and a half, it's a bit of a letdown. It is by no means a bad film, and the current Tomatometer rating it has is an absolute travesty. Pixar's reputation has not been tarnished and they're still, by far, the best studio in Hollywood.Even though Cars 2 is a bit of a disappointment, I think it's probably healthy for the studio. I was discussing it with my dad and he brought up the point that working under the pressure of your audience expecting a masterpiece every single year must be a nightmare, and while Cars 2 is disappointing, the fact that Pixar released a film that's just good instead of great gives them some more room to breathe. The critics have had their chance to give Pixar hell (and I'm sure there were many who were eagerly awaiting such an opportunity) and Pixar was able to make a film that didn't need to be a masterpiece to be entertaining.So now I've got to put an actual score on this thing. Ergh- I was dreading this moment... I'm going to cheat a little bit here and give this film two scores, one accounting for Pixar's history and the expectations that brings with it, and one that does not. So treating Cars 2 as the followup to Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Cars, Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up, and Toy Story 3, Cars 2 gets a:C+Now, judging Cars 2 completely by itself, without the legacy of Pixar as a factor it earns a:B",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another great visit to Radiator Springs and other places!,"I like these Cars movies and this one was just as good if not a tad better than the original! This time the directors John Lasseter and Brad Lewis bring a few new characters to the mix as in Francesco (an indy type car) who after Mater's ( this time voiced by Larry The Cable Guy) bating challenges Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) to race him in a championship race in his home country of Italy. Also new to the mix are Pixar's version of James Bond's 007, Finn Mcmissile (Michael Caine) and M Holly Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) two British top super spies who find unknown and very hidden espionage talents within Mater's rusty parts. This second visiting with all the folks of Radiator Springs, brings us more of Mater then Lightning, which some have found annoying, i remember reading one critics review in which he wrote that Pixar had found their very own Jar Jar Binks. Well I for one like the Mater character and found he along with the little forklift that assists him at the garage only adds to the laughs. If you and your family loved the first one then you will definitely love this one as well. I love all the Pixar films and always say bravo to them upon every review!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar blows a tyre..,"'Cars 2' is preceded by 'Hawaiian Vacation', a short film set in the Toy Story universe. Despite the fact that 'Toy Story 3' was supposed to be the end of the franchise, Pixar seems reluctant to let go. It is not hard to see why - despite being only 6 minutes long, this appetiser manages to pack more Pixar magic than the main feature.That is not to say that 'Cars 2' is a bad film. There are clever ideas, and moments of charm and wit, but the film does not spend enough time on them. As a result, the film fails to reach the lofty standards associated with Pixar.At one point during its development, the film must have centred on a new story, with new characters. As the film opens, British secret agent Finn McMissile (Michael Caine, as a DB5) investigates a conspiracy involving alternative fuel, scaling an oil-drilling platform with magnetic tyres and grappling hooks.The mood is one of intentional melodrama, simultaneously revering and ridiculing the adventures of 007. The sequence inevitably culminates in a car chase, and it is more thrilling and visually appealing than anything that EON has produced in recent years.Things should have stayed that way, because 'Cars 2' is at its strongest when it has nothing to do with its predecessor. Alas, Finn McMissile becomes a secondary character, while the narrative returns to Radiator Springs. Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) accepts a challenge to participate in the World Grand Prix. Accompanying him is his best(est) buddy Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), whose bumbling misadventures become the overpowering flavour of the remaining 90 minutes.It is here that the film blows a tyre. As a supporting character, Mater was fun and endearing. The hillbilly schtick came in small doses and served as effective comic relief. Placing him in the spotlight and trying to make him a hero, however, highlights the character's lack of depth. Jokes based on Mater's stupidity mostly consist of slapstick humour, which wears thin very quickly. What makes this worse is the decision to merge his storyline with that of Finn McMissile.It is one thing to make a 'Cars' spin-off based on Mater, but quite another to combine a simple, child-oriented narrative with a more serious, sinister plot that, at one point, actually involves car-torture and car-assassination. The result is dissatisfactory, creating a jarring blend of the right things in the wrong proportions.There is barely any solid racing, which unravels the foundations from the last film. There is not enough spy drama, which raises questions about the point of introducing the espionage element at all. On the other hand, there are many attempts to be funny, the success of which depends on the age of the viewer.Ultimately, 'Cars 2' is a wasted opportunity. The Bond-inspired opening hinted at great things that were merely sprinkled throughout the film. It is a solid example of animation, but it does not feel like it is really part of the Pixar collection. Over the years Pixar has built up a reputation for films accessible to adults and children alike, and this is not one of them.Children will no doubt have too much fun to notice the lack of sophistication, but adults used to the universal appeal of Pixar's standard fare will find this disappointing. 'Cars 2' is a fun film, but it is no 'Toy Story 3'.",,Anonymous,Animation
James Bond & Johnny English,"That these two names can be characterized by the greatest super agent 80% of the film. Naturally Bond - is a real agent Fin MakMintl and unusual Inglish - a tow truck Maitre. It is usually assumed that the sequel - a rather bitter word, since they are unsuccessful, try to go to the past glory of parts, and just a quickie. I can not say the same about this cartoon, but still the first part was better. And the main character this time is not lightning, apparently by his friend liked the writers, because even a single cartoon about it is.In the wheelbarrow was morality, and so bright, not worn out. Here you have a lot in recent years have seen films about the choice between wealth, fame, recognition, and real, genuine friendship? Personally, I am not one. Well, continued - it is the purest spy thriller, only slightly seasoned friendship of the main characters, and thoughts about the destination. Although it's too bad, the summer after all.Interesting question, I came almost immediately after the start of the session. Lightning McQueen took command of the first part of the finals for only one race? Now it has different mechanics or just dub is not quite correct? And yes, sad news for fans of Doc Hudson, undefeated, it will not. Why, you will learn in the first five minutes of the film. To be honest, I was hoping to continue to see plenty of racing, as in the first part I did not have them, and ""lucky"" they are really more. On the whole one. Well, what do you want from the spy thriller? Secret spy gadgets, shooting, car chases, explosions and even murder. But not racing. I even remember Rush Hour (tour of Japan), and the film Johnny Inglish (almost all of the master, including the final). Incidentally, in the cinema around me (and many before me, and after, both the left and right) were children of kindergarten age 5-6. And they did not like. Not a children's cartoon apparently unsuccessful, although a lot of funny moments.The quality of pictures can say a lot, but why? After all, it's Pixar and Disney, they are always on top. The scenario is not taken out, but the picture is simply amazing. Soundtrack matched perfectly. It is mainly noticeable in the scenes of battles and races, which is quite natural and logical. But it also happens in quiet moments, the music makes the astonishing skill of composers.As a result, for an incredible picture, sparkling humor, spy gadgets and a good soundtrack put a solid seven.ps: in the credits is a special thanks to Steve Jobs, I wonder what he did?",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"This should have been a Dreamworks picture, not Pixar!","Cars 2 is the latest offering by Pixar, the only studio I am aware of that up until now has had a perfect running of first rate films. Cars 2 is finally where the studio giant Pixar takes a big downturn in quality. Don't get me wrong. It is not a horrible film. It has several things working for it, such as creativity and absolutely dazzling animation, but it lacks a story with resonance. The original Cars was a slow grower for me, a movie that got better with each viewing. That is because it had a story with heart, characters you cared about, and a flat out brilliant ending. But everything here works only on the surface. I didn't like the excessiveness of Toy Story 3, Pixar's giant last year, but that still very good film gave screen time to all of the characters we loved and had many moments that were simply magic. There is none of that here, so you're pretty much stuck with an action packed spy movie (a violent one at that - no small kids should watch this one). Mater replaces McQueen as the lead (an unfortunate decision, as a little bit of Mater goes a looong way! That's why he is so much better suited for the short Mater's Tall Tales animated shorts.). McQueen makes a splash on the screen here and there, and that's it. Luigi, Guido, Doc, Flo, Ramone, Red, Sally, Model-T, and Mac get almost no face time and their dialogue is really useless. The plot has twists and turns and ends up being pretty ludicrous. The new characters have no depth to them whatsoever, the only slightly amusing one is Francesco, played by the great John Turturro. Even the stunning international setting of the movie is treated rather haphazardly. We are delighted for a few seconds by beautiful world cities only to have the awe and beauty pulled out from under our feet a few seconds later. Even the race is meaningless to the story. And so it is all spy movie, an average one at that. One can't help but think that Pixar for some weird reason was eager to make another Cars film just to rake in the toy merchandise sales later. They should stop having john Lasseter direct the films. Of all the films, his (with the exception of Toy Story and Toy Story 2) are the weakest. They've got Stanton, Docteur, and Bird who are all fantastic filmmakers and storytellers. And please, get a story that transcends the medium, not plays down to the audience!So all in all, Cars 2 is a slick, competent, and somewhat boring picture. It reminded me of watching a Dreamworks cartoon. A few chuckles, a few okay moments, and then ho-hum... Average at best. Shouldn't carry the Pixar name...",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good movie... a little out of character,"I personally enjoyed the movie very much... It was full of action and had the same old Pixar humor. The only things that critics said that was seriously wrong with the movie was the fact that they build to much on Mater's character... Mater's character in the first one provided comic relief for the movie. In Cars 2, they made the comic relief the main character. The entire movie was based around Mater and that is what made it funny. But for some people there was to much of him and not enough of the original Lightning McQueen. This is a valid point, but it doesn't ruin the movie.. I would suggest watching it for sure!JRT",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The entire idea of the AMC Pacers and Gremlins being the bad guy cars was an insanely good idea. Seeing all of these other countries in the cars universe was great. Some of the finest voice acting roles in all of Hollywood with performances from Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy.

"Not Pixar's best film, but still certainly enjoyable!","""Cars 2"" is the sequel to ""Cars"" (well, duh). The only thing is, the two movies are hardly related to each other. In ""Cars"", Lightning McQueen, a spoiled hotshot race car, discovers the meaning of true family and friendship. In ""Cars 2"", the story focuses on Mater (McQueen's best friend) and how he somehow gets caught up in a spy mission.I was prepared for disappointment, considering all the reviews that I heard. But I was really surprised! ""Cars 2"" was very enjoyable! The humor was funny and the action was great! I did like the plot. It sort of reminded me of a real James Bond film. Who knew talking cars and an action/mystery genre could work?Most of the reasons that people didn't like this film was because this sequel wasn't related to ""Cars"" at all. But if the first film wasn't considered, then people would find that ""Cars 2"" is actually be a pretty good movie! But to be honest, I think that I would have liked this movie more if it was a new original Pixar movie, not just a sequel to ""Cars"".While watching this, just forget about ""Cars"" for a while and enjoy the humor and action that ""Cars 2"" gives.

Stunning,"An animation movie is worth what's worth that's all. But this one has a whirl of stunning images and scenes technically almost perfect and extremely efficient and impressive. The humanized cars are greatly expressive in terms of ""facial"" and ""body"" features and gestures that make us always forget they aren't people. Their movements look human indeed. And we don't see a single human being all through the movie as if the world was peopled with cars behaving like people and showing human feelings and thoughts, some of them being the ""bad"" and some others the ""good"" ones. There also several good humoured sequences like those performed by the tow van character, a really well conceived one. And the reproduction of cities like Paris, London and Italy are very realistic and beautiful almost looking like photos. And the story? Well the story the less important aspect of the movie as it often happens in animation movies. Something about the use of car fuel, the very modern duel between petrol and alternative less polluting fuels which in this story involve a fight between the ""goodies"" who defend the former against the ""baddies"" that try to discredit it in favour of petrol by means of several criminal and violent actions.

"Decent Animation, But Definitely Not Pixar!","Cars 2 is actually not a half-bad film as many people are claiming it to be. It's a sequel to the 2006's hit Pixar film, Cars. While Cars turned out to be weakest film Pixar has ever made, it still had a heart and a message. It was more about the drama and relationships between the characters rather than action. Unfortunately, this is the first Pixar film to lack that heart and to substitute it for plain action. As an action fan, I really liked this move. As a Pixar fan, I was wondering what the heck happened.Our heroes Lightning McQueen and Mater returns as they travel worldwide to race in the World Grand Prix. But while there, Mater seems to have been caught up in some kind of international conspiracy.The voice actors are pretty good. I wanted to see more Owen Wilson as McQueen because I felt he wasn't in the movie enough as this film was based more on Mater voiced by Larry the Cable Guy.Overall, this is a good movie if you don't associate it with Pixar. I enjoyed the action scenes and the crisp animation, but I couldn't help feel disappointed that this is not the Pixar film we have came to expect. I rate this film 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Top shelf sequel,"Pixar seems immune to the problems that studios normally have with their sequels, in that Pixar's sequels don't, you know, stink. Cars 2, like the Toy Story films, captures every bit of sincerity, thrills, and pitch-perfect animation that the original did. It's a beautifully shot movie with terrific voice characterizations, including a surprisingly awesome turn by Larry the Cable Guy.In the movie, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has settled down in Radiator Springs with his girlfriend Sally Carerra (Bonnie Hunt) when he is goaded into joining a three-country race by an Italian Formula One car voiced by John Turturro (who's hilarious). Naturally, Lightning must take along his bestest best friend, Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), who's - shall we say - not as world wise as McQueen or the rest of his crew. Hilarity ensues.To add to the tension, all of the racers are required to use a new alternative fuel invented by eco-awesome-dude Sir Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard), but when a few cars mysteriously explode during the first leg of the race, in Tokyo, people start to wonder if the fuel is indeed safe. Of course it is - because the real culprit - as we learn right away! - is employing electromagnetic pulses to disable the vehicles in the hopes that people will blame the fuel, which will bring them back to good ol' yummy oil. But tipped off to this subterfuge is British agent Finn McMissle (Michael Caine) who, along with his new-to-the-field sidekick Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer), is out to stop whoever's behind all of this - and that, my friends, is where Mater comes in.This isn't really a Lightning McQueen movie; he's more of a supporting character, as Mater is unwittingly pulled into the espionage business by the Brits, who mistake him for a fellow agent (those English are so gullible!). But because of Mater's inelegance and lack of focus, McQueen winds up losing that first race, a result for which he blames a crestfallen Mater. There's your friendship conflict, always a reliable trope in animation.The race then shifts to Milan and then London, with Tuturro's Bernoulli and Wilson's McQueen trading many a barb and insult (with Bernoulli usually winning). This allows the animators to mix in some awesome scenery from both countries, and you'll swear it's filmed rather than animated. Absolutely spell binding.The two plots, the spy angle and the brotherly friendship deal, dovetail nicely by movie's end, but not before we're honestly treated to some spectacular stunt driving (ahem) - off roofs, down parking garages, and so on. It's like parkour for cars, which most of us would call driving but the cars here probably call walking and climbing.I saw this movie not only in 3D but also in IMAX. I've said harsh things about 3D, and IMAX costs even more per movie. It's all worth it here. The colors are vibrant, and when something SHOULD leap out at you, it does, and it looks really, really good. The sound is shattering; your seat will rumble. It's a visual orgy.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A nice twist to the series,"Cars 2 is a good follow up for an outstanding first movie. Inspired by the 007 series, this story surprised me and delivered a more in depth character development of Sir Tow Mater (you'll get why I said Sir if you watch the movie ;).Not as good as the first (like most sequels), but still an enjoyable, well animated story.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Two Words:  No Heart,"Visually dizzying and emotionally empty, Cars 2 is an amazingly indulgent piece that seems to throw out the Pixar ""story"" book in favor of strained plot and graphic excess. Just because you can doesn't mean you should. This is reported to have started as a film-within-a-film from the first Cars, and perhaps it would have worked well as a longer short. As a feature, though, it lacks anyone to care about and any reason to care about them. And while it may be family-friendly in the broadest sense of the term, it is not for young children - some scenes are dismally intense, and the by-the-numbers plot will still lose them. I saw it with a 7- and 9-year-old, and they were not impressed. ""The first one was better"" was the general agreement. Lasseter and company should perhaps consider another Robert McKee seminar before moving forward with the Monsters Inc. sequel. Five stars out of 10 for 25 years of really great film making.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fails to deliver,"I begin with a quote from John Lasseter, the movie director: Let me tell you a funny story. I took the family to see this film one weekend - I'll go to see almost any film that's good for the whole family. And so we're sitting there watching this film, which I won't name, and there are long stretches that are just not very entertaining. My little son - he was probably 6 at the time - was sitting next to me, and right in the middle of this dull section, he turns to me and says, ""Dad? How many letters are in my name?"" I must have laughed for five minutes. I thought, Oh, man, this movie has lost this little boy. His mind has been wandering, trying to figure out how many letters there are in his name. So I told my wife, Nancy, what he said, and she started laughing, and then the story went down the row through my whole family, our four other sons, and we're sitting there as a family giggling and laughing. And I thought to myself, If ever a child anywhere in the world leans over to their daddy during one of my movies and asks, ""How many letters are in my name?"" I'll quit.John Lasseter's job is as safe as ever. Cars 2 will not give children the time to think for themselves.The constant rapid action sequence, illogical plot, double meaning punch jokes that are not very funny even for an adult, and primarily no strongly developed character with which to identify will leave children and adults confused just enough to prevent them from considering number and letters in their names.What a difference from the original Cars. Cashing in on the merchandising success of a great original story developed with sensibility for strong character, relationship development, outsider inclusion, Cars 2 feels like a feature length commercial.Financially, it will be a success. Because it seems to be its primary objective. Entertainment value ? Perhaps for those attracted to mindless exploitation of the few low common denominators that seem to work on a certain relatively high percentage of viewership: SFX, chase, shootings, fire, blowups, wow-effect. Perfect for a constant gratification bred viewer. Good storytelling ? Who needs good storytelling anymore... well, the kids do.Joe Ranft had it figured out, and has delivered, what a great talent and what a loss, even more apparent now, after release of Cars 2.Cars 2 is a major disappointment on many fronts. The expectations were high after Cars 1, and such a long long wait, I must admit. But to give up on even trying to get close to the beauty of Cars 1, that is unforgivable.

Cars returns and goes global.,"I like the direction Pixar decided to go with Cars 2. Turning it into a globe-trotting spy flick is a fun and interesting way to continue the story without having to retread anything that happened in the first movie.With that said, I am not a fan of Mater, and the fact that he's essentially the main character of the movie is not exactly my cup of tea. I can completely understand how kiddos love him and find him hilarious, but he annoys me to no end. So, as much as I enjoyed some parts of Cars 2 (including the addition of Emily Mortimer, who automatically makes anything better), I can't say I'll be eager to see it again soon. It's bright, vivid and looks amazing, and there's a nice little story of being true to oneself at the heart of it, but the Mater overload is just too much for me.Cars 2 can't compare to the best Pixar has to offer, but there's a 99.99% chance that there's a young one in your life that will have a blast watching it (and playing with the toys that you're inevitably going to have to purchase afterwards).",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Spy Cars - Action with little heart,"Cars 2 is the sequel to Pixar's Academy Award nominated film, Cars. This film is centred around Mater, not McQueen but Mater who is a rusty tow truck with a lovable personality. The movie's basic plot is Mater being mistaken for a spy while accompanying McQueen throughout the World Grand Prix races.First off, I think the movie lacked the ability for the audience to be emotionally attached to the characters, therefore there was not any great character development. Everything we knew and loved about the characters was not furthered but rather left at how it was in the first film. Luckily, they have built a strong foundation.The film's plot was good but could have been better. Spy Cars could have been a good name for the movie. Its creative however a bit silly at times. It wasn't very predictable but the ending is something you would have thought of possibly happening, which ruins movies for me.However the animation is amazing and it is a very enjoyable film for what it is - an animated spy movie involving cars. All in all I enjoyed the movie but I expected more from it, especially in the emotional aspects.Good job Pixar but your standards are slowly dropping.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The First Worst Movie Pixar Has Ever Brought In,"Up until now, Pixar could do no wrong. Hopefully, this will be both the first and last time with ""Cars 2."" Pixar has so far been the best animated studio for the last 15 years or so, and has never delivered a bad movie even once. They don't resort to pop culture references and star egos like Dreamworks has around the same time. But then, even Pixar hasn't been intact with ""Cars 2."" With this movie, the studio is condescending to the level of Dreamworks also with pop culture and star egos, not to mention a confusing storyline that can baffle the young ones. Still no matter how bad the reviews, and I'm agreeing with them,the movie will rake in business like any other animated movie from the 1990s on.What is wrong with this movie? Where can I begin? Well, first of all, the story borrows and rips off the James Bond movies during the Sean Connery era. Although Michael Caine has never been James Bond, he is sure suave and reliable enough to play any British spy, animated or live action. He definitely is the perfect fit as the British secret agent car Finn McMissile. His part is good enough, but he doesn't seem to intertwine with two of the original ""Cars,"" the hero Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) or the redneck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), who now upstages McQueen as the hero. Mater has the role as an unwitting agent and is foil to Finn McMissile and his sleek female assistant Holley Shiftwell (The British actress Emily Mortimer), and even falls for her at the end of the movie. Still nothing of interest.Second, the story is way too confusing. It's all about greed of the oil supply. The villain is Sir Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard), who wants to replace all of the gas oil with synthetic oils so cars can use it in a World Grand Prix in Tokyo, Paris, Monte Carlo, and London. There are even offensive jokes about the Italian mafia, something never done in Pixar before, and Pixar usually has kind, sensitive humor. Mater, Finn McMissile, and Holley Shiftwell join forces to thwart this dastardly attempt and restore the oil to its normalcy, while Lightning McQueen races against a new Italian Rival Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro).Third and most important of all, it is rated G, and with all the frightening gunplay and violence, and literal bathroom humor, it should be rated PG. Some people would suggest it should be PG-13. Back in the day, there were numerous G-rated cartoons that should have been rated PG, and PG-rated cartoons that should be rated R. ""Cars 2"" is no exception to the inaccurate ratings of animated movies.The only good things about the movie are the colorful artwork, especially in the Tokyo sequences, and the addition of other characters besides cars, such as submarines and a smiling plane named Siddeley, McMissile's espionage partner.I'm so glad I didn't bring any small children to this movie. There were no laughs in the audiences and the children came out of there asking their parents, ""What's it all about?"" Original characters come back in smaller cameos, but their scenes really had no place in the movie. The actor doing Fillmore did a lame imitation of George Carlin, who died three years ago. Luckily, Doc Hudson, played by the late great Paul Newman, wasn't replaced, he had a small tribute. If ""Cars 2"" had the same type of endearing storyline like let's say, ""Toy Story 2,"" or ""Toy Story 3,"" adults would have been fine with it. But no, it had to be like any routine animated movie from other studios. Hopefully, Pixar in the future will go back to it's usual style again because there is an adult audience for animation.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Family was so disappointed!!!,"We are huge Pixar fans.. love and have every movie, but this was actual the first Pixar film we seen on opening night.

I would of like to seen a less violent approach too.. I don't recall ever hearing ""kill em"" in any Pixar film, unless it was in The Incredibles, but this is something I would think that such a great company would of some what worked around in the story line. I would of liked to have seen Cars 2 to be successful, but seeing all the reviews now proves that I am not the only parent that feels they just blew fifty dollars at the movie theater.

Im Fan Cars,"This film seemed great for the plot on which it was placed , very different from one part which I thought was very childish but with a very beautiful teaching, love cars. Lightning Mcqueen my favorite part favorite Mater realizes how foolishly he has been acting. The criminals use the weapon on McQueen during the race, but nothing happens. Mater escapes to warn his friends of a bomb planted in McQueen's pit, but Finn and Holley find out that the bomb is actually planted in Mater's air-filter. They warn him about the bomb, but he flees to protect his friends. As a reward for his heroism, Mater receives an honorary knighthood from the Queen and returns home with his friends, where the cars from the World Grand Prix take part in the unofficial Radiator Springs race. Fillmore reveals that before the last race, Sarge replaced McQueen's Allinol with Fillmore's organic fuel (which prevented McQueen from being affected by the weapon). McMissile and Shiftwell arrive and invite Mater to join them in another spy mission, but he graciously turns it down. He does ask Shiftwell for a date when she returns which she accepts. He gets to keep the rockets they gave him earlier, which he now uses in the Radiator Springs race. Excited!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar continues its slow descent,"I was so looking forward to Cars 2. The action and the animation are very exciting and eye catching. However, the story was lacking. It did not have the magic of the first one. More importantly, Pixar had to slide a politically correct, liberal, environmentalist theme in it with the 'alternative fuel' topic. I am so sick and tired of the hoax that is 'global warming', hearing about 'go green' and how gas / oil is the great evil. I didn't need two hours of that garbage shoved down my throat. If that agenda had been left out of the movie, it would have been much more enjoyable. It was good to see the characters again. There will be plenty of ideas for the diecast Cars characters collectors (which I am one). However, the 2nd movie just does not measure up to the first one. The music soundtrack of the first one blows this one away. There were very few songs in this one. Go see it just because it has been 5 years of waiting. Just don't get your hopes too high.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Bizarre Fever Dream,"Cars 2, despite the same characters, felt unfamiliar. The plot follows Lightning McQueen as he races in the World Grand Prix; meanwhile, Mater is tangled up with world spies trying to stop evil oil tyrants from killing race cars and alternative fuel. When first watching the movie, audiences justly question whether it had started or if what they were watching was a Pixar short before the film. The plot was overcrowded and felt nothing like the original Cars movie. The writers should have stuck with the World Grand Prix idea and never introduced the spy story that took up ninety-five percent of the film. The flow of the story felt rushed, and there was never enough time to pick up on the easter eggs during the movie hinting at the secret bad guy. The movie's theme can be summed as ""once big oil, always big oil...man"". Money and power will not make a person happy; instead, they should focus on their friendships and relationships and accept who they are. The characters and voice acting were extremely good, yet wasted on a bizarre movie. The scenes were once again in amazing Pixar detail, and the cars looked different from one another (providing another great merch campaign). The soundtrack was surprisingly catchy but not as iconic as the original. This movie felt like an awkward cluster and did not feel like a Cars movie considering the original. The spy theme would have been great in an extended Mater's Tall Tail episode series; Pixar has had no issues throwing mini-series in theaters in the past. The writers had a good idea for a World Grand Prix; everything after that is questionable.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cars 2: A High-Octane Disappointment,"Pixar's ""Cars"" franchise has long been a fan favorite, with its charming characters and heartwarming story. However, the sequel ""Cars 2"" fails to live up to the expectations set by the original.

The animation is top-notch as always, but the new characters, while visually interesting, fail to leave a lasting impression.

About as much fun as a migraine.,"I truly hated watching ""Cars 2"" as it is not only a sequel no one other than John Lassiter wanted but it also has a plot that manages to squeeze all the joy out of the franchise. Additionally, it does something with Mater that I didn't think was possible...it made me hate him about as much as Jar-Jar Binks! Yes, this movie is that bad.Before I talk about the bad, I should at least point out that the CGI is incredibly well done and beautiful. Even seen a decade after it was made, the look of the movie just blew me away.That being said, the plot is a garbage fire. Instead of making it about race cars, racing and Lightning McQueen are only a small part of the film. Instead, it's mostly a film about Mater and spy cars. Yes, I said spy cars...godawful and totally out of place spy cars. While I am sure some of the Pixar folks thought this was clever and cute, believe me, it's not. It really seems as if the script and stupidity of the plot never was a concern to anyone at the studio...and you wonder how it got made in the first place as common sense says to only use Mater in moderation and DON'T MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT SPY CARS.

These handshakes get longer every year,"The international Grand Prix is meant to prove that fossil fuels should be left behind for a more sustainable alternative. Mater is struggling with McQueen not being able to spend all of his time with him - part of that is probably that he's still somewhat embarrassed of him. However, this makes him the lead character, and gives him a chance to prove himself.I love when a sequel doesn't just try to be the exact same thing as the original. From right away, this is a different sub genre than its predecessor; it's very clearly a classic 60s or 70s spy film, with gadgets, international secret missions, etc. This informs the atmosphere and action. They even cast Michael Caine in a very important role.There is some racism in the depiction of Japanese people(frequently speaking their own language, unsubtitled) and entertainment; it's very based on the stereotypes that Americans have about them. And the fact that some of them are at least seemingly positive doesn't change that it's very othering - comparatively, it makes the French and especially the Italians look much more relatable.There is more gross out comedy than usual for Pixar, though it's still not as bad as some of its competition. The animation is smooth, with great use of colour, lighting and camera angles.I recommend this to every fan of Cars. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Seriously take the lead character, make a second movie but make the lead different in the second movie. Then of course back to lead on third, which was much better and good plot.

Over hated bit still pretty bad.,"I grew up on this movie so I don't hate it as much as others. However I still think it has flaws. And major ones at that.

They also undo all of his character development in the first Cars movie. This film does have some amazing things about it though. Micheal Cane is an amazing character in this movie and probably the best. It is still dumb Cars fun like the first film.

"Perfectly fine and fun Cars movie, but lacking heart.","I went into this with much lower expectations than supposed to, this was a genuinely fun movie. But perhaps the fact that it's just fun and comedy may be the reason it doesn't succeed as well as the original cars. Now love him or hate him, Mater is a great side character, Cars 2 turns him into a main character and that's always a risk. Resulting in a much more lighthearted movie, focused on humor and slapstick comedy. A simpler movie.But this movie has great pacing, aside from the start which really is something you do not expect, James Bond, in Cars? I had to adjust a bit to this plot but in the end it worked out. I liked the spy characters a lot. And well I guess in essence this is a adventure spy movie with a clumsy/silly main spy. Very similar to something like Johnny English with Rowan Atkinson. And whilst this lacks the brilliance of Atkinson at the wheel, Cars 2 still got plenty of laughs out of me. I like Mater, I was hesitant at first during this movie with it maybe being to much, but it worked out for me, it's balanced enough not to be obnoxious.The music was noticeably different, fitting to the very different theme I guess. It was good but definitely not memorable at all compared to the original movie. Directing was fantastic, everything looked stunning as well, the different cities looked incredible and the fidelity was mesmerizing. Almost too much detail you want to pause the movie just to have a good look around.I'd rate this Pixar movie very close to something like Monsters University, a sequel that was really fun, but had a lot less heart and emotional weight. And it's not like it tried and failed either. And I think the ratings are somewhat harsh. Overall it's a fun addition to the franchise, I enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"After many home runs, Pixar finally strikes out.","Pixar is arguably the last remaining film company with a perfect track record. From Toy Story to Toy Story 3, each of their films had been met with grand acclaim and multiple Academy Awards. However, I can safely say the perfect track record ends this month. Cars 2 is a bafflingly disappointing movie that tastes even more bitter since its coming from Pixar, the makers of the best computer-animated films of all-time. Everything that has made Pixar movies range from decent to incredible to perfect was neglected here: from the mediocre script, to the lack of heart, to the lack of humor, right down to even commercializing their film a bit with some awkward product placements and a multitude of new characters that provide nothing more than just providing more toys to sell. Cars 2 was totally unnecessary, and just didn't deliver in any way shape or form---except for the animation.In Cars 2, we have this bizarre spy plot weaving in with a grand prix championship that takes place around the world. Without spoiling too much, there is a conspiracy going on throughout the grand prix and Tom Mater is sent on a mission to uncover who it might be. At the same time, it loosely threatens his relationship with Lightning. In terms of script, this was by far the weakest because there was no character development, minimal true conflict, no surprises, and it absolutely contradicts the lessons (mildly) learned in the original Cars movie. This movie was made purely for the kids as it offers very little subtle adult humor aside from all the snarly vehicle references.I will never understand why Pixar felt the need to create this movie whose only purpose was to make money and merchandise the heck out of it. You would think after billions of dollars in revenue with original and clever stories it would be enough to keep their creative juices flowing while at the same time deliver a profit for Disney. But this film was easy to market, easy to distribute. And with that comes laziness, and it was all-too prevalent here. Cars was the film least necessary in the Pixar lineup to warrant a sequel, prequel, whatever. Just the fact that Pixar drove a movie just for profit sake heavily tarnished their credibility as an animation studio that e used to believe was focused in telling great stories in multiple ways.Let's at least focus a bit on the positive. The voice cast was all back (with the exception of George Carlin and Paul Newman, of course) and with a few new voices in the mix. For the most part they did a good job, even though some didn't have much to work with, incredibly Owen Wilson as the main character Lightning being the main example. The animation was stunningly beautiful, but what else do you expect from Pixar? They are leagues ahead of the next-best animation studio, as their vehicles and settings were detailed down to a T. The action scenes were well-drawn out and have better cinematography as the typical action flick.And now we shall go back to complaining. The movie felt a lot like Speed Racer: it was a decent racing movie but had a plot too convoluted for children, yet had a premise that was appealing mostly to the kids. Cars 2 suffers from this same fate, it has a spy storyline that complicates itself to a point in which the kids will be utterly lost, but still doesn't have the feel of a movie that the entire family can enjoy—its more a movie for younger boys, who will be utterly lost once the second act kicks in. The movie also doesn't dwell into deeper adult themes like previous Pixar movies like Toy Story 3, Up, and (especially) The Incredibles.Bottom Line: Cars 2 is Pixar's first disappointment, and it hurts so much more because we know what the studio is capable of. What baffles me the most is the sheer minimal amount of effort to continue the trend and tradition of the preceding Pixar movies. Much like what happened with Indiana Jones 4 (which to this day I deny it exists), it deviated so badly from the formula of success that any strength it may have had is deterred by the fact that.we have seen so much better from that same staff. Cars 2 was pointless, redundant, lifeless, and just nothing like what we are used to seeing.The original was subtly hinted to be a pet project of Pixar's leader John Lasseter, and the only reason we are even seeing a sequel is because its Lasseter's pet and because merchandise sales were the greatest for Disney since 1994's The Lion King. Let's hope this is just a speed bump and not a downward spiral, because I would hate to see less Up-quality films and more Cars 2-quality flicks. Maybe this will be a wake-up call for the company--especially if they don't win the Best Animated Film Oscar next year. In the meantime, prepare for a snorefest if you are dragged to watch this. Pixar, you finally flopped. Took 25 years and countless good memories, but it has happened.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Good film,"Good film. It's a good movie. A few random people here and there wondered about ""how the world was supposed to work"" in Cars, and it seems like Pixar responded by giving them the finger. It's not that they have that in mind while they're making it--Pixar probably meets criticism with a shrug of, ""Yeah but our movies make millions and are children's fantasies with actual stories, so we'll just go about doing our work and you can deal."" However the point I'm making here is that though the more open theme of environmentalism is going to be the one getting the most press, the subtheme of identity politics is what drives this movie (pun intended), and that makes it closer to The Incredibles 2 than any of their other works, really.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best Pixar movie ever made maybe even car movie,The hate is too much this movie was entertaining from start to end and featured many many wonderful scenes and dialog combined with James bond like moments and just was excellent. Mater was excellent including McQueen the sequence of story from mater trying to do undercover work and stop a criminal faction while his friend McQueen was trying to win the cup achieved higher expextiom than I expected as mater was left with a choice McQueen his friend or finn mcmissle (voiced by the great sir micheal Caine) and im not putting spoilers. Overall I think its worth the watch even without watching cars 1 as its a great single movie but a even better sequel thank you to john Lasseter for director such a great movie.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Bits for the kiddies, bits for the grown-ups, unfortunately not enough for either.","Technically Cars 2 looks amazing, as all animated films do nowadays. There were times when I was looking at close ups of various automobile parts and I could've believed they were photos.The problem is that everything is just a little off. A little forced. A little clumsy.In the past Pixar has made concessions to no-one, sure they had their share of cute toys, animals and in this case cars, but they made films without the 'for'.They weren't 'for' kids. They weren't 'for' adults. They simply were. If you got it – and most people did – great. If you didn't, well you Sir/Madam were in the minority.Here there are sections for the kiddies and sections for the adults.The kids sections are mostly alright and revolve around a global series of races between Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) and a cocksure F1 race car named Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro).The 'grown up' part is where things go a little awry, it seems Pixar have spent so many years hearing about the little touches that set them apart that they decided to throw as many little touches into Cars 2 as they could. The result is a thousand ideas trying to get through the door at the same time. Each time the spy part came back to the centre I found myself wanting them to start another race so it could be simpler to like.Cars carefully tries to pander to as many demographics and groups in the audience as possible. The toddlers like the bright colours and cars of course (there were three ads prior to the film marketing them), the other kids laugh at the funny voices and dream of one day racing their own car, the grow-ups get the more adult references including the subplot about spy-cars voiced by Michael Caine and Emily Mortimer (do you really think a kid will get the Bond stuff?) and recognise the notable voice cameos, (I was told afterward that the guys from The Deadliest Catch and some real life race drivers all had minor roles. I am neither a Deadliest Catch or racing fan so I caught neither).The problem is that in blatantly trying to pander to every audience – again something Pixar has needed/bothered to do before – Cars 2 becomes everything and nothing to no-one.Everyone gets something but not enough of it. After a while I gave up trying to feign interest in the spy stuff which is sporadically included and channelled my inner toddler by waiting for the next car race scene. At least the byplay between Bernoulli and McQueen is your standard trash talking and not the try-hard spy stuff or the slightly forced 'save the world through efficient fuel message. Don't they realise they are a planet full of cars?Oh, and there is a dreadfully misguided 'lesson' to be had here. The hotted up, successful and universally adored Lightning McQueen finds best pal Mater – a rusty old tow truck with a redneck accent and social deficiencies – a pain in social situations and basically alienates him early in the film. It takes the rest of the film and numerous pieces of advice from others, before McQueen learns that friends are friends.If that's what it takes to learn that McQueen is a dick, and Mater would've been better served without his 'friendship'.Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. I still liked most of Cars 2. So did a couple of mates who took their kids. My 4 ½ year old liked Cars 2, but nowhere near as much as he likes Nemo and Toy Story. I think that will prove the legacy of Cars 2, a film that tries so hard to please everyone that it will end up the film that everyone 'kinda likes'.Just not enough to bother watching it again. Sorry Pixar but after 15 years you finally dropped the ball.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A different approach,"The first part centered around human drama, more like a coming-of-age/slice-of-life feature, while the racing segment was purely & simply a formality. In this case, however, the sequel appeared to have taken a more mainstream/commercial approach, shaping & moulding the script to be another of those elevated espionage thrillers.Don't get me wrong. I am not opposed to, nor do I wish to undermine, this fairly different approach, but I would have personally preferred a sequel more in the vein of its predecessor. Although this continuation has plenty of tricks up its sleeve, I kind of missed the heartfelt tale of the previous iteration; I would pick that one over this in a heartbeat.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Rustiness overhauls the glimmer.,"Instalment two of the lightning quick, ferociously outrageous, family orientated Cars franchise sees Lighting McQueen (Owen Wilson) and his compatriot Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) come together again to compete, but on a slightly, only somewhat generously proportioned scale, in a World Grand Prix race. The road to success in this outing concentrates the majority of its filming on Mater. Whilst attempting to support his best buddy racer McQueen we see the productive pick-up truck becoming distracted by a top secret covert mission: international surveillance, hired by Finn McMissile (Michael Caine).With a new adventure on the cards for the lovable duo beyond the South-western desert of Radiator Springs, Mater and McQueen embark on a perilous journey of cooperation, a break-up and an identity crisis. The protagonist role takes a twist with Mater being registered as the hero in place of McQueen. Although McQueen is recognised for his high speed chases around the globe, Mater's role sees the dusty, rusty articulated vehicle bind all the pieces together giving this second addition of the Cars franchise a heart-warming appeal that all the family will draw an ounce of pleasure from. With an incursion of a number of opposing rivals including Francesco Bernoulli, played by John Turturro, this version will certainly tamper with the nerves, but since when hasn't Pixar taken us aboard its roller-coaster of adventure.Pixar never seems to disappoint, providing consistent and successful family entertainment that children will solicit for parents to take them to the movies. Once the credits role they'll be accelerating out of the screen deeming themselves to be a metaphor racer of Lightning McQueen and finally, ultimately requesting for the merchandise products to re-enact the movie. Whether Cars 2 topples the first instalment, Cars, only audiences will determine. It cannot be denied that Pixar is consistent and they'll be more to follow.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Spys versus Cars,"Pixar animation has had a terrific run of films with a high emphasis on quality control. Cars was the one film to have had a decidedly mixed critical response but its international box office led to a sequel with Cars 2.Lightning McQueen and Mater returns as they travel internationally to race in the World Grand Prix. To keep the international audience satisfied the action moves to Japan, London, Paris.However Mater gets caught up in some kind of conspiracy as British spy Finn McMissile infiltrates some untapped oil reserves owned by a group of 'lemon' cars. After being discovered, he is forced to flee and fake his death but mistakes Mater as an American spy who is roped into foiling the plot.Owen Wilson returns once again as Lightning McQueen with his cool, laid back tones but the focus shifts in the sequel to Mater voiced by Larry the Cable Guy. However Mater is a country bumpkin and there is little room for character development. The plot is rather easy to guess, its fun, chugs along easily enough but not up to the usual Pixar standards.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Wait, this is Pixar?","Pixar's first sequel to one of their other films aside from the Toy Story series (and I think their might be a third coming in this one). I will say when I first watched this ""007"" themed catastrophe, I was quite confused and a bit overstimulated. As I kept watching it though, it actually grew on me much more than I expected. Even from when they developed the early previews and teasers for this film, I (and I'm sure almost everyone else) personally thought it was strange to go from a more country-style caring and love story to a secret agent/mystery suspense phenomenon. I will say though that the whole world-of-cars theme was really cool from seeing the bright-lighted sights of Tokyo to the posh environment of London. It was also cool to see a large amount of new ""live"" vehicles like the war ships from the beginning of the film and the planes from the airport. Finn McMissile was a styling new character cleverly voiced by Michael Cane (from the new Batman series). Of course out of all the different misfits, the film still had some good charm that relates to the first film, like McQueen getting into another collision between unsuitable instances and another teachable moment that talked about friendship. This may have been a low for Pixar, but their films do continue to raise enough interest and warm-hearted moments after this one. A pretty decent film overall.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Decent, but nowhere near the original.","I loved Cars so much when I was a kid. As a child, it was my favorite movie of all time. When I heard they were making a sequel, I genuinely couldn't wait to see it. Now don't get me wrong, this movie is good in my opinion, but I feel it is a little too dark to be a Cars movie. This doesn't even come close to the original. This movie's violence and darkness almost matches up to Disney's Brave Little Toaster (1987).

Weakest Pixar Entry,"Cars has always been the weakest Pixar series, but this has the recognition of being their worst. Empty film, and a film that wasn't required. Cars 2 takes the central figure and hides him in the background. This is all about Mater and everyone knows, Mater is strictly a support character. The Cars series has always been about the bottom line. Disney's influence is felt here and that's a shame for an independent studio like Pixar. This was made during a rough patch for the once invincible studio.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cars 2 is Truly an Underrated Masterpiece,"Cars 2 is easily the best film from a usually unemotional, unoriginal studio -- Pixar -- that has finally mastered the art of cinema! This the most intelligent, emotional, and riveting movie since Pulp Fiction. The action is unique and exciting, the animation is stunning and pleasing, and the score is better than every other spy movie. Without all of these flawless technical achievements, Cars 2 would still stand out for its fabulous story and deep, complex characters.Many people who lack true taste in cinema would claim that the story is contrived and confusing, but that is only because they lack the mental capacity necessary to comprehend such a deep, complex, and emotional story that requires viewers to understand interesting and unusual, but ultimately rewarding situations. Many people also may object to making Mater the protagonist of this film. If anything, Mater is the greatest character f the entire Cars franchise because he has depth and emotion and feels unpredictable in his development, unlike Lightning McQueen who finds a way to be a spoiled brat in every single movie only to come around by the end. Mater does not come from the privileged racing background that McQueen and others come from. He is modest and compassionate, even if others don't understand him completely. Through Mater and his misadventures, John Lasseter intelligently reveals how understanding and empathy will always solve problems instead of create them. That is proven many times throughout this film when Mater is misunderstood by cars who believe themselves to be more superior than a plain, old tow-truck. Sure, many of the misunderstandings are small moments that are played for great comedy and successful laughs, but others are intelligent and deepen the characters and plot. It isn't until the end when Mater reveals to them who he truly is and the other cars come to understand him that all of the problems are resolved.That is why I believe that Cars 2 has the greatest message of all the Pixar films. Many may say Inside Out has the best message that encourages kids to embrace sadness, but that is only a good message if you enjoy seeing sad children cry and suffer. In the end, Cars 2 is a very rewarding experience, both for kids who only will enjoy this film for its face value entertainment and stunningly-animated action scenes and for the adults looking for a deep, intellectual story or compassion and understanding. Definitely a must-watch for any cinema-lover or person who wants to be nice.

Outstanding,"""Cars 2"" (2011) is a Pixar film that diverges significantly from the heartwarming tone of its predecessor. While visually impressive, it struggles to recapture the magic of the original, leaving many viewers feeling disappointed.The story follows Lightning McQueen and Mater as they embark on a global racing adventure. However, the focus shifts dramatically from racing to an international espionage plot, thrusting Mater into the role of an unlikely secret agent. This abrupt change in tone and focus alienates many fans who were expecting a continuation of the original's focus on friendship, self-discovery, and the importance of community.The humor, while often slapstick, feels less organic and more forced than in the first film. Mater's antics, while undeniably entertaining at times, can become repetitive and overwhelming, overshadowing the development of other characters and the overall narrative.Despite its shortcomings, ""Cars 2"" boasts impressive animation, showcasing breathtaking global locations with stunning detail. The film also introduces a diverse cast of international vehicles, adding a layer of cultural richness to the world of Cars.Ultimately, ""Cars 2"" is a mixed bag. While it offers visual spectacle and some entertaining moments, it fails to capture the heart and soul of the original. The shift in focus and the overreliance on slapstick humor leave much to be desired.However, it's important to acknowledge that ""Cars 2"" still holds a certain appeal for younger audiences who may enjoy the fast-paced action and the introduction of new and exciting characters. It's a film that can be enjoyed on a purely entertainment level, but it ultimately falls short of the high bar set by its predecessor.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Cars 2, A Cinematic Failure","Okay where do I start.
The entire premise of making a film that is revolving around a side character usually doesn't work, and this film is no exception. Mater is a dumb tow-truck used for comic-relief and nothing in the first film even hints at anything more than that, and this film makes it seem as if mater is some sort of hero, when he is not.
When you want to make a sequel of a film, a good way to do that is to answer a frequently asked question about the film's universe and solve it by making the film. For example, Toy Story's universe sought the question ""What happens to toys when they are abandoned?"" and made a sequel out of it. I don't think anyone in their right mind would watch Cars and think ""I wonder where the spy cars are?"" It is such a stupid and unnecessary way to expand the universe.
The plot makes absolutely zero sense. The villains are oil diggers, and make prophet from cars buying oil. Their evil plan was to make Allinal (Alternative fuel) look bad by blowing up cars so that the public will stick to oil. However the creator of Allinal is in on the evil cars' plan. So they basically created alternative fuel just to make it look bad so people can stop using it, and use oil, EVEN THOUGH EVERYONE WAS ALREADY USING OIL!
Mater somehow is the one to figure out who the bad guy is. If you watch the scene where he figures it out, it's just so hilariously bad that it hurts. Somehow, Mater was able to figure out Axlerod's plan even though it was so idiotic that even the Spy cars right next to him couldn't figure it out, because it just wouldn't make sense for it to happen. Cars 1 made Mater to be an unintelligent side character, but he is somehow able to solve a mystery that Spy cars who are trained in this field couldn't figure out.
I don't usually poke at movies for being convenient, since just about every film is at least slightly convenient, but this film takes it to another level. For this film to work, you have to have the evil cars come up with an idiotic plan that makes no sense. The intelligent spy cars must be dumb enough to believe that Mater is the American Spy. You also have to have lightning McQueen be dumb enough to believe Mater is talking to him during the first race. Then you have to have Lightning go against literally everything he learned in the first film just so Mater can get sad and try to leave on a plane. Finally you need Mater to figure out the stupid evil plan that the spy cars couldn't even figure out.
Everything that this film does is something way off of what the first film created. I am all for the expanding of a universe if done good, and it isn't done good in this film. The only slightly interesting and accurate- to-the-universe plot in this film is quickly abandoned at the end with no real conclusion.
Every little detail in this film seems to be there just so they could make a prophet on it from Toys. For example, the rocket jets, giant cars (that show up for a good 5 seconds in the actual film) and even the freaking wannabe race cars that the film never even explored.
From 1995-2010 Pixar made nothing but spectacular, intriguing, heartwarming films. This was the first Pixar film that wasn't good, and it was also their first non-Toy Story Sequel. Like I said, From 1995-2010 all of Pixar's films were great, and from 2011-2018 (Present) There are only 3 films (out of the 9 they made) that I believe live up to the standards of the 2000s Pixar Films. What I'm trying to say, is that this film was the beginning of Pixar's downfall.
And that is why this film is one of my least favorite films of all time.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
A good experiment!,"I have to say that after the first time I've watched ""Cars 2"", I thought ""what was that!?""
Surely my perception of drama was ""spoiled"" by ""A Bug's life"", ""A Toy Story 1,2,3"", ""Wall-E"" and so on. But the more I watch it (my daughter adores all ""Cars""), in addition with some recent animation, I understood that ""Cars 2"" is a very brave and courageous attempt to explore a new genre in the animation. It seems both hilarious and natural how this redneck Mater investigates a crime through the prism of his unique personality and how he goes through steps of growing without betraying himself. Masterpiece!Surely McQueen pisses off in this movie, the whole story isn't emotional and I don't know who I can personify myself with. Relationships between the characters are superficial and nothing thoughtful. And I don't like spy movies)
But that's my problem.I think that this movie is a great job of real masters of their craft and today ""Cars 2"" would get at least 7,5 rate. In 2011 ""Cars 2"" had a ""bad"" neighbor ""The Toy Story 3"".",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Not as strong as other Pixar films, but hardly one to bury either","I love Pixar's films, they are beautifully animated, touching and funny with good messages and universal home truths, and they also have great music and characters. I was expecting very little from Cars 2, seeing at how much hate for it there was before and when it was released. But I went to see it anyway, as I convinced myself that even if it was disappointing there has to be at least some redeeming value to it.And there was. Cars 2 initially did strike me as an unnecessary sequel, however while it is my least Pixar film I liked it actually, and to me Pixar have yet to make a film that I consider bad. Just for the record, I liked the first Cars. Before I saw this, it was my least favourite of Pixar's films, however I loved the animation, the race sequences, the music and Paul Newman. That said, I did see the first Cars recently, and it was a little better for me on re-watch especially when it came to the message.Anyway about this film, there were a few things I didn't like so much. One was the plot, I admire Pixar for trying something a little more ambitious and different with the themes of espionage and all that. However, while there are a number of entertaining moments, as a whole the story didn't quite gel for me. Some have complained it was too dark, that wasn't my problem. My problem was that the story was convoluted in places, and I also had the feeling there was too much going on as well.I had mixed feelings about the script. Some of it is laugh-out-loud funny, with witty and droll quips that made me smile. Conversely there are some stretches in the film that feel rather lengthy, due to the pace dragging and the scenes feeling a little too talky for my liking. Others have said about Mater too, I can understand where they're coming from. Larry the Cable Guy to me is not the problem, he puts a lot of enthusiasm into the character though he occasionally overdoes it when the dialogue is not quite as strong as it could be. I personally think Mater is stronger as a support character, he has his moments in the spotlight here, but for a lead he isn't annoying as such but somewhat bland.On the other side of the argument, there are many things to like about Cars 2. The animation for starters is absolutely amazing. The colours are rich, the background art is focused and the characters move with ease. And need I mention that London and Paris for examples look absolutely beautiful? The race sequences are as exciting as can be, while the music(the first John Lasseter-directed film without a score written by Randy Newman) is energetic and very fitting and memorable. When the dialogue works, it does work and is very witty and funny.The characters are still engaging. Mater while not entirely working for me has his moments, while Lightning is still interesting and amusing not to mention cocky. The female lead Holley has plenty of personality and is very strong, which is a welcome departure from female characters that have a tendency to be uninteresting or bland, and Finn McMissile is a welcome addition. I loved also the brief mention to Doc Hollywood, which was quite a touching tribute to the late great Paul Newman who voiced him.The voice acting is terrific. Owen Wilson is as assured as he was before, Larry the Cable Guy is suitably enthusiastic if occasionally trying too hard and Emily Mortimer is lovely as Holley. I'd also like to mention Michael Caine who joins Paul Newman(Cars), Peter O'Toole(Ratatouille), Christopher Plummer(Up), Ned Beatty(Toy Story 3), Willem Dafoe(Finding Nemo) and Kevin Spacey(A Bug's Life) as yet another great actor to voice a Pixar character, and a fine job he does too.Overall, not Pixar's best, however I don't think it is one to judge so harshly. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Good movie! Uplifting message for ALL!,"The first part of the comment is long and if you get tired of reading it, I understand, skip to the next part. But, there are some good points.First, DO NOT DOWN RATE IT JUST BECAUSE IT WAS A PIXAR/Disney MOVIE WITH SPY ACTION AND GOT A 'G' RATING. Pixar/Disney is not responsible for the G rating. The MPAA is! I think it probably got a G rating for all of the intriguing and educational cultural subtleties and for some reason that's the way movies seemed to be rated. No sexual innuendos, no cursing (including the Lord's name in vain). Oliver! the Musical is a great example of an interesting G rated film. It has drug usage and theft all over it! Why is it rated G? Who knows? Anyway, if you are going to judge this movie based on: ""Well, it has too much violence for a family movie"" and not on its actual quality and without considering the really wholesome and uplifting messages then think about movies like 'The Incredibles', which has certain marital innuendos, plus more violence than Cars 2 AND more references to and scenes of death; think about ""Prince Caspian"", which CS Lewis in his books wrote for children around the ages of 6- 10, which has mild war scenes and scenes of betrayal and murder. They are movies which are wholesome which can be enjoyed and discussed by the ENTIRE family (maybe excepting really young ones). The ONLY difference is this: The two titles mentioned above involve people and not automobiles! Please don't kill good quality wholesome movies with your low ratings just because some MPAA people didn't give it a PG rating. And don't base your opinion of it based on whether it was appropriate for your 4 year old. Do you watch plenty of other movies that you don't let your children watch which actually contain swearing or violence or innuendos of any kind and like it and give it a good rating? If you don't want your kid watching CARS 2, then don't let them watch it till they're 8 or 9, that's all.Second, it was a REALLY good quality movie with an amazing message and really witty and hilarious cross-cultural humor which is in no way offensive. It has a really good message about friendship and not putting others down and calling them stupid (PERFECT MESSAGE FOR FIRST GRADERS!) and that everyone has some type of special ability or talent or knowledge and is vital to completing a mission.Third, I was surprised at first when I heard they were making a sequel to Cars. I mean, what more could they do with the plot if it is only about racing? McQueen already learned his lesson about not being boastful. I was pleasantly surprised to how they shifted the attention to the supposed idiot and turn him into a hero and conveys, once again, the message that anyone can be a hero.I loved it! Everyone that has seen it with me loved it! I spoke with a guy in the theater who could probably relate to Mater's story, someone who probably seems to be an idiot and who is disabled. He excitedly told me that it was his third time watching the film. I could see that Mater was the hero with whom he could relate. I am sure that there are a lot of kids who may feel out of place at school and they can relate with Mater's story. Perhaps that is why it is rated-G, so that kids can learn at an early age those wonderful lessons as well as gain a deep appreciation for cultural diversity.(Again, if you really don't want your children to watch it, then that's fine. But, don't give a less-than-deserved low rating for it not meeting your idea criteria of a rated G movie.)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Silly, very silly","The original 'Cars' was okay. An innovative, fresh, humorous and peculiar approach on an animated movie. Although with flaws, at least it had some soul and character.This one? No way! Let me start by saying that the animation is excellent combined with even more complex and ""ambitious"" scenarios than the original's (more light and more color too) but both the plot and the humor fail miserably.One of the many problems of this movie is the fact that it takes place in many countries. Stories set in several places around the world just don't work (see the case of ""Love Actually""!). I gotta admit, there are awesome sceneries of Japan and Italy, but in London they made the Big Ben look so phony. I wonder if they did that intentionally? Perhaps. Being a sequel, logic isn't the 1st, 2nd, not even 22nd priority.Unlike the original, Mater is the leading character. The film is practically about him. Mater was funny in the original. Here he tries too hard to be funny and as a consequence he becomes too clownish, even irritating.It was actually hilarious when Mater ate that icecream and urgently needed to drink water because it was too spicy for him. Anyway, the ""joke"" of Mater going to the bathroom and afterwards farting was too much. Mater is even confounded with an international spy, for dang sake!They attempted to repeat some of the jokes from the first movie, but none of them worked the way they did in the first one: the famous ""ka-chow"" line and the joke of the tractors, for instance.Doc Hudson is missing, perhaps because Paul Newman has passed. They mentioned Doc Hudson, but the way they were referring to him makes one think he probably died - either that or else he migrated.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

This is PIXAR's worst film. Meaning not bad by usual standards.,"Once in a while, top-notch filmmakers and/or big stars take a break from making their usual brilliant passion projects, and go to do something fun, just to lighten their brain before preparing for the next big thing. James Cameron had ""True Lies"" in between his epic/sci-fi extravaganzas. Before ""Unforgiven"" Clint Eastwood made the buddy cop thriller ""The Rookie"". Edward Zwick who is known for his big-scale action epics like ""The Last Samurai"" and ""Blood Diamond"" made the sexually charged comedy ""Love and Other Drugs"" last year. The best example is probably Steven Spielberg, who can balance crowd-pleasing blockbusters ""Indiana Jones"", ""Jurassic Park"" to hard-hitting historical dramas ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Munich""; and still have room for more.PIXAR is no different. However, most of the critical backlash seems to be programmed disappointment for the sequel to arguably PIXAR's weakest film, at least before this. Granted the first ""Cars"" wasn't as excellent as PIXAR's other efforts, but I appreciated the ""small-town values"" message it was trying to convey.Right off the bat let me start by saying that ""Cars 2"" is PIXAR's worst film by far. But ""worst"" by PIXAR's standards is ""OK"" for overall movies. It's still watchable and enjoyable, though not as heartfelt, emotional or intelligent as previous PIXAR outings such as ""Up"" and ""WALL-E"". PIXAR just wants to have fun. Let them.The thing that turned off the critics the most is the blatant change of pace from the previous film. ""Cars"" was a drama about appreciating small town values. ""Cars 2"" is an exciting fast-paced action-adventure in vein (and possibly in tribute) to the gadget-laden Roger Moore/Pierce Brosnan James Bond films. It does not have a heartfelt message. It does not try to do so. It aims to entertain. And I admit, being a James Bond film fan myself, it was very fun to watch.The story shifts focus from Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) to Mater this time, though I wonder what the executives were thinking giving Larry The Cable Guy the lead in a PIXAR movie. But never mind. Mater comes across as goofy and dim-witted as usual, but at some points I felt as if PIXAR was going to Dreamworks-type humor.Having said that, I did enjoy Michael Caine, Emily Mortimer and Thomas Kretschmann as the new key characters to the franchise, and some of the action sequences are indeed exhilarating. Helped by solid voice work, fluid animation, gorgeous scenery that looks like the perfect travelogue, and frenetic and engaging music by Michael Giacchino (why hasn't EON Productions hired him for the next Bond film yet?) all combine to make a fun summer flick that entertains.Critics have found ""Cars 2"" to be a tad too violent for kids. The James Bond movies (before Dalton) and the ""Indiana Jones"" films were mostly rated PG and had a variety of spectacular and dangerous stunts and innuendo and had people dying too, and yet families still bring their kids to watch (no wonder why the darker and more cruel ""Licence To Kill"" flopped). ""Tom and Jerry"" had the two fighting and bashing and blowing each other up in almost every episode, yet kids still watch (and love) that. ""Cars 2"" is no different, though I fear the backlash may be started for giving this a G rating instead of a PG.But then, I have to criticize it for having poor characterization, a cookie-cutter story, some lame jokes and having almost no strong moral message like PIXAR movies usually do. Thought the ""alternative fuel"" was a nice touch though.This blockbuster is good for parents who are willing to introduce their little boys to the James Bond films. Apart from that, let's hope PIXAR has had their fun and go back to serious business. The kind that makes another ""WALL-E"".Overall rating: 60/100",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
better for older kids,"My older child and myself enjoyed the film, however, my 4 year old who can watch Cars 1 all day if I let him, wanted to leave and go home half way through the movie. It did not hold his attention and didn't want to continue to watch it. It did not appeal to the younger crowd in our area. Many children who were younger that we know also were not impressed. A few younger ones were crying and bored and wanted to leave also who were across from us. It seemed to be geared for a littl older audience which sort of let down the younger group who really loved the first one. It's still a good Disney film, just not what we expected and it was a let down for our younger children.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good movie but aimed to the wrong audience.,"I understand why some movie critics are saying that Cars 2 is not Pixar's best flick. However I won't say it is a bad film, because Pixar simply does not make bad films, they might make good films without the right one-two punch combination, and certainly Cars 2 is one of those films. This is not a bad movie since the superb animation effects are there and so is the astonishing attention to details, especially on the Italian and Londonese city locations, simply these blew me away, not to mention the never ending action sequences. But, and yes, there is a but, probably Cars 2 will not fit all children interest, especially the younger ones due to the violent scenes and the political and espionage intrigue suitable for young and older adults. And that is what I dislike about Cars 2. Some do not like Mater as the main character of the film, but remember, the title of both Cars and Cars 2 (in plural) dresses not one protagonist but more than one if you will. The same argument I have for the Toy Stories trilogy, in TS 1, Woody is the hero, in TS 2 Buzz Lightyear is the hero and in TS 3 every character stands out for the same cause. Pixar is and will continue to be the industry leader in CGI animation, although Dreamworks and Blue Sky have their success, still Pixar knows how to deliver fun, excitement, action, story and emotion to their flicks. In Cars 2 is was the action, excitement and technical cues that stood out, but again, not all movies are the same, you have to constantly look out in every direction possible in order to succeed.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Still it's a great film,"Well, many people describes Cars 2 as ""disappointment"". I don't think so. As a Pixar movie, it might not be as good as others, but still it's a great film. Perhaps we expect Pixar too much. After the year of 2008, we had wanted to see next Pixar film even better than Wall-E(I think it's the best of all). But can it be easy? Recently I've seen a lot of Hollywood cartoon movies. Among them were some wonderful films, also boring ones. Cars(1%2) is special, which makes me feel totally differently from any other one. The character McQueen impresses me deeply and the relationship between he and Mater is as fantastic as well. I had expected Cars 2 could get a rate of 7.5, at least 7. But it only gets 6.4! Even lower than Turbo(6.5, DreamWorks Cartoon). Strange!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good movie, but not special like its predecessors!","Cars 2 is a fun movie to watch. As we have all come to expect from Pixar the movie is visually stunning. The modeling of cities like London, Paris, Italy etc. are not only rich in detail but hilariously modified to fit in with the anthropomorphic Cars theme. Pixar's creation of this car world is highly intelligent and I was thoroughly amused.The plot involves a lot of action, humor and generally good entertainment but adopts a more conventional mainstream action/mystery/adventure form. I suppose it has detracted a little from the usual Pixar method, which is to get the viewer emotionally engaged. The emotional engagement made Pixar's work special and Cars 2 is not really as special as Pixar's previous work.But there is no doubt that Cars 2 is entertaining. Ratings are a relative scale, and the rating for Cars 2 is only low because we've come to expect so much from Pixar. Any let down therefore is a severe blow. This movie would have no doubt been rated higher had it perhaps been directed by, say for example, Mr. Michael Bay.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The perfect movie,Saw this for the first time 10 years ago. Never seen a more perfect movie since. People can complain about the fact that the focus on lighting McQueen disappears a bit but the fact that they combined action with cars was for a 7 year old the dream.It's easily the movie that is the closest to my heart.The only bad thing about the movie is that lightning McQueen does not win the final race and we never get too see any of McQueens wins on the big screen but that is also a bit bittersweet so I understand what they're thoughts was behind that decision. Mater in this movie is easy the portrait of him in any of the three movies. I had so big hopes for the third after this but that was a true letdown.This is the first movie I'm going to show my kids.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cars 2,"'Cars 2' (2011) picks up a few years after the original left off, with Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) winning 3 more Piston Cups since we last saw him win his first and has now been invited to participate in the new World Grand Prix. In this sequel, the attention is divided between McQueen and his tow-truck best friend Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), who is unwittingly roped himself into a top secret mission involving international spies.Yes it is another Pixar sequel, and not the last from the highly regarded animation company with the follow-up to 'Monsters, Inc.' (2001), 'Monsters University' slated for a 2013 release. Is this a bad thing? Yes and no. While many commentators will argue that 'Cars 2' is the beginning of the sale of Pixar's soul, I tend to give the company a bit more credit than that. Not only have they created some of the greatest children's films of the past 20 years, but have created films that transcend the 'target' audience and leaves a lasting impact on audiences of all ages.'Cars 2', it must be said however, is not their best work. In fact, it is probably one the least enjoyable experiences I have had out of a Pixar film. The important thing to note though is that this does not mean it was bad. Not at all, rather just lacking in comparison to the brilliance of 'Finding Nemo' (2003) and 'Toy Story' (1995). All in all, it was a good family film, with a particular emphasis on action. 2 long action sequences that bookend the film are brilliantly done and is some of the best high-speed work done in animation. Mater is extremely lovable, goofy character and complements the excellent voice work of Michael Caine as the international spy Finn.Where I have issue with this film is the script. There are too many cheesy one-liners plucked from the last 30 years of children's action films and not enough slickness and wit that usually overflows from Pixar's scripts. There is also a lack of sentiment that accompanies the best of the companies films. 'Finding Nemo' for example, makes me, an 18 year old, cry, laugh and cry again all in the space in 90 minutes. That powerful use of emotion is not found in this film, at least not to a great degree.However, that makes it seem a lot worse than it actually was. It was still a great film (certainly better than anything DreamWorks can put up), and it made my and my brother laugh numerous times.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

This is Mater's movie, but has plenty of interactions with other Characters.I loved seeing the Lemons, AMC is well represented. Nice plot, not too difficult for younger children to pick up.Several ""Easter Eggs"" are included in this movie along with a nice mention of ""Doc Hudson"", a nod to the passing of Paul Newman. Even though this was a ""boys"" movie, my wife enjoyed the details into the cultures and geography of the locations of the races.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not as bad as I feared,"I am the kind of person who enjoyed Cars 1 and Cars 3. They aren't the greatest movies ever made, but I feel like they get a bad rap from certain people for being, I dunno, basic, or whatever? And I suppose for also primarily being vehicles (heh) for merchandising.That's pretty reductive, but... that's also exactly what Cars 2 is. Take the kid-favorite character (Mater) and put him in to grand, over-the-top, globe-trotting adventure that basically only exists to put toys on shelves. And it's for that reason that I avoided Cars 2 for a long, long, long time. I was not seven years old, so the adventures of Secret Agent Tow-Mater had no allure to me.Then the worst blizzard in a decade hit and I found myself trapped at home without any internet for an extended period of time... and a copy of Cars 2.And... it's not so bad?Like, it's not great. But there's at least a little more to it than just being a 90 minute toy commercial. It essentially takes the ""fish out of water"" premise from the first movie and flips it around the other way: instead of superstar racer Lightning McQueen being stranded in the middle of nowhere, redneck tow truck Mater finds himself accidentally stumbling in to a secret agent's lifestyle. How that happens is pretty flimsy, but not especially offensive.What stands out the most to me is how much this movie highlights just how strange the world of Cars is. They talk about the dinosaurs, and how they, as cars, depend on fossil fuels. There are great lengths paid to showing how cars operate computers and shoot guns. There's a Car Pope and somebody says ""Chrystler"" as a stand-in for ""Christ."" They give Mater a tiny device that can install any piece of clothing or weaponry on his body, holographically, just by voice commands. He asks for gatling guns and suddenly hidden compartments open and he starts spewing hot lead. Those compartments weren't there ten seconds ago. The device he was given just manifested them out of thin-air. And they're real guns! They have a device where you can just say out loud ""give me weapons"" and you instantly and automatically transform in to something that has weapons. Cars 2 stretches and stretches and stretches until the whole movie threatens to break.It's also a family movie where, when you break it down, Larry the Cable Guy has to figure out a Japanese toilet to un-piss his pants. On top of, from my read of the situation, apologizing for ordering porn on his hotel TV? And then laughing at ""PP"" jokes, even though he's a car and probably has no concept of human genitals?A very, very strange movie. But not as bad as I feared. It manages to pull off not being total nonsense.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Nutshell Review: Cars 2,"Pixar had always treaded carefully when it came to follow up films, with only Toy Story getting the honor given its established fan base, and soon, Monsters Inc getting a prequel as well. As to why Cars warranted a second film would be anyone's guess, but I suppose the story allowed some bandwidth to break out of the small town of Radiator Springs and into the big leagues of an international racing circuit to the tune of a lot more merchandise and toys to make money from, that it perhaps proved to be irresistible.The idea is a no brainer, since there's F, the World Rally Series and others to tap more ideas from, that the story by John Lasseter, Brad Lewis and Dan Fogelman could adapt from, featuring cars of all makes and series being put together and competing with one another around the world. Or at least that's what the initial premise was thought to be, until someone decided to include a major plot to centre this around a James Bondish espionage tale about oil versus bio fuels, sidelining what would be simple to follow for the kids, and making this one vehicle based spoof of Bond, complete with gadgets, planes, trains and more automobiles.But that's not to say I didn't like the idea, since it had a very interesting motivation and adversary built between the elites - those branded, luxury models and the lemons, mass produced vehicles who don't have prestige nor prominence, but go about their daily chores if not for faulty and cheap parts to break them down at times. This was an aspect that was present, but could have played up a lot more, especially since we are dealing with fat egos in Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), and that of his rival in this installment, the Formula One Italian car Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro) with an even larger ego that came complete with ill wisecracks.And who knew the main character of the film swung from Lightning McQueen to his small town buddy the tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), who enrolled his race car friend into a competition organized by Sir Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard), a tycoon bent on proving bio fuels to be a safer alternative to oil. So a crew from McQueen's posse at Radiator Springs got put together, and off they go into three legs of a race around the world, in Japan, Italy and England. But it's spy versus spy stuff with Mater got tangled with British spies Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and his assistant Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) as they go about trying to uncover who the mastermind is behind the sabotage of the race, and perhaps these episodes were the most fun, having the bumbling Mater working together with the slick spies in many set action pieces. It's pretty adult with its espionage theme complete with torture and murder, so parents you've got some explanations to do.With Pixar you can be quite assured of the quality of animation in this film, but somehow when compared to the other Pixar films of late, from Wall.E to Up to Toy Story 3 even, those films had a lot of heart and emotion put into their characters, whereas this one lacked that emotional punch, coming close to reiterating the importance of friendship again, but overall feeling too superficial, focusing a lot more on the technical aspects of an animated film, and the buffoonish Mater for comedic effect. It's akin to waxing the exterior of a vehicle to shiny perfection, but pop the hood, and the flaws show up with the lack of a proper, driving engine to fuel the story.It's still not that bad when compared to other animated films in recent years, but given that Pixar had raised its own bar so high, Cars 2 fell a little short, though still no less entertaining as a film, just never being able to reach the company's stratospheric heights in terms of storytelling, and heart.Those who missed our friends from Toy Story will do yourselves a favour by coming into the cinema earlier to catch the usual short preview before the main Pixar feature, where we see the toys rather settled in their new home and new owner, and turning their play environment into a Hawaiian paradise so that Ken and Barbie can share their first kiss. It's a short feature, but these precious minutes prove to be quite the powerhouse with drama, romance and comedy all rolled into one, and in itself worth the price of an admission ticket.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Crazy, but enjoyable!","I liked the first Cars movie. It was honestly an enjoyable tale of how one person or in this case car can change in a new environment. But the sequel seems to be different. Released 5 years after the original, critics and audiences alike slammed it with negative reviews and considered it to be the worst Pixar movie. I actually disagree with this statement. Here's why!The story has lot's of things to tell. Lightning McQueen and his friends decide to join a grand prix sponsored by Allinol, an alternate oil company, that makes environmentally safe products. However, strange events happen when most cars get exploded after they used the oil, and now a new character named Finn McMiselle needs to find out what's going on. After a sudden meeting with Mater during the race in Japan, he's mistaken as a spy, they need to stop professor Z from evil plans. Even if the plot itself isn't the best, it was enjoyable with action scenes and all the gadgets being used. It tries it's best to combine the spy and race elements, but somehow it gets a little bit too confusing. Especially the ending, which is a spoiler, so I won't tell what happened, but it had the best scene, where Mater and McQueen were driving really fast in London, which actually gave me some adrenaline. I felt like I was riding as fast as the speed of sound.I must say that some characters were left underdeveloped, especially compared to the first movie. Mater somehow became the main character of the story. Sure, I've seen other spin off films like Penguins of Madagascar, Minions, Buck Wild and Finding Dory, but somehow this was advertised as an actual sequel, and not spin-off film. Which could be disappointing to most fans, especially those who loved McQueen. Anyways, Mater was still acting dumb, which was sometimes funny, especially when he mistook wasabi for a pistachio ice cream. But when he feels upset, you actually feel bad, since no one takes him seriously outside of Finn and Holly. Sadly, he barely changes and develops. He still acts the same after the mission. Not to mention, the be yourself message feels so out of place for a film like this and it was added at the last minute. McQueen was more of a supporting character and felt bland, so moving on. The spies Finn McMiselle and Holly Shiftwell were the spy duo that try to solve the mystery of the suspicious alternate oil and Professor Z's evil plans. Both were really interesting, they were serious and smart. Especially when coming up with various plans. Professor Z was a really forgettable character, he was the typical ""small guy with big brains"" kind of character. There's no other way to describe him. Francesco is just an Italian version of Chick Hicks from the previous installment. Although his Italian accent sounded good. Last thing I'd like to mention is Doc's absence. He sadly passed away like his voice actor Paul Newman. Which is probably for the best, since removing the character was a better option then replacing Newman with someone else.Finally, the animation was huge improvement over the original. It had so many locations like London, Rome, Paris and Tokyo. They actually look great, and although they were slightly modified to fit the car universe, they still look lively and immersive. The designs were also creative, with new vehicles like boats and planes. Same with new race cars. Like I said before, the action scenes with all the chases felt so awesome and fun, like you had a ride on a rollercoaster. And I love the fact that it had more racing than the first one. But sadly, it lost most of it's charm, that made the previous installment more emotional.The best way to describe Cars 2 is a popcorn flick. Just a movie that has action, racing, humour, but with little to no heart or emotion from before. Luckily, not the worst sequel or Pixar film, since I still enjoyed it. But it didn't feel like a serious movie, but rather a cash grab, that was made to sell more Cars related products. It's really hard to recommend it. But my advise is to just watch it to find out whether you like it, hate it or just find it ok. I'm not sure about the fans of the first movie though. But it probably depends on each individual, some will enjoy, some will not. So, it was fun, almost good, but it was a pretty mindless film.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Satisfactory to see unfold,"I like 'Cars 2'.It doesn't deserve to be held in the same bracket as 2006's 'Cars', but that doesn't mean there's not a good time to be had with it. The premise mixes motorsport with espionage, admittedly they don't execute it incredibly but it's still satisfactory to see unfold.One slight negative is that they give Mater more screen time than Lightning McQueen, which is a mistake. Larry the Cable Guy as Mater is enjoyable, just not front and center as the lead. They could've done a similar plot that has Owen Wilson and McQueen at the forefront. Elsewhere, Michael Caine (Finn) is always a joy to listen to; even if his character isn't anything special.The racing stuff is cool, with the World Grand Prix. The parts of the story involving strictly that are definitely more entertaining than the spy stuff, especially as we get to see a few different countries via animation - which come out nicely.All in all, a weaker film than the first for sure but it's still pretty solid for a Disney animated sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The worst Pixar movie ever.,"As we all know, this movie became the worst movie Pixar has ever made. In the commentary, John Lassiter said that he has always wanted to make a spy movie. Really? Than why didn't he thought about making a original Pixar movie on that instead of using that as a sequel to Cars? To this day, there hasn't been a Pixar movie that hasn't been bad as this and I think it should stay that way. This is a good example of a movie that was made for merchandise only, I mean I remember seeing merchandise based on this movie everywhere and it is ridicules. The part that seems to bother me the most is Holly Shiftwale became half plane towards the end of the movie, why didn't she become half plane from the beginning? Now let's all agree that Pixar learned their lesson and will never make a movie as bad as this, hopefully. I mean, look at Cars 3, it proves how much they learned from their mistakes and to me, Cars 3 is the true sequel to the first Cars movie and not this terrible sequel.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

After the terrible criticism this bold and different movie received, Pixar just lost their nerve. They made safe * good for rotten tomatoes* movies. What about inside out? You ask. Yes, its good at a creative level. But there is no strong opponent or conflict, leaving you unsatisfied about the story (i haven't seen coco, yet).

We didn't really need this. But it was pretty good none the less,"Who'd off thought. Off all the great Pixar movies we've had. Was ""Cars"" the one (outside off ""Toy story"" off course) that really deserved a sequel? Either way we have one, and I personally found it too be an improvement off sorts on the original, even if it is understandably Pixars least successful film too date.A Sequel should always give us what we loved first time round as well as introducing something new, and that's exactly what ""Cars 2"" does. The Lead character off the first film (voiced by Owen Wilson) returns too race in a major new racing event, while his comedy sidekick pal gets involved with a brand new espionage plot involving new spy-like characters such as Michael Caines.Where the film will divide people is with the later. The pick-up trucks story seems too overshadow the rest (reading that sentence back too myself makes me realise just how much off a push this all is with talking cars being the stars off the movie) and it doesn't help when the characters well, kind off annoying!Still, the film is filled with glorious action, amazing animation, and is very funny too (if you can get your head around the fact that this world is like ours but is dominated by living cars!) even if some off the terrible vehicle puns and flatulence jokes take the film way down from Pixars usual high standards.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than you'd think it would be.,"The critics may have jumped the gun on this one. Cars 2 is just as fun as most other animated movies.

Mater actually makes for a good protagonist and Larry the Cable Guy is well used in this movie. This film isn't exactly well- written, but it has a strong enough emotional arc and appealing visuals to make up for it.

fun with a dark side,This film right of the back was not Pixar at its best but still very much on form. although personally i find it a little bit hard to relate to cars playing people i did find this film endlessly enjoyable to watch as with any Pixar film. The points where i feel this film fell short was that the story was pretty strange for a film that was originally meant to be about racing and the spy aspect did feel a little bit off. what I found very odd in a film that is a U was the level of death and i know that might be a strange thing to say since all the characters are all cars so what does it matter if they get blown to peaces but aren't people meant to be able to relate to these characters and if some of the things that happened in this film happened to real people then this film would at least be a twelve. However this film is a great peace of summer fun and is much more enjoyable that most of the films that have been released this summer.,,Anonymous,Animation

A Disappointing Sequel That Fails to Live Up to Its Potential,"Cars 2 is a 2011 animated film directed by John Lasseter and Brad Lewis. The movie follows the story of Lightning McQueen and his friend Mater as they travel overseas to participate in the World Grand Prix. However, the film's focus on a convoluted spy mission detracts from the racing storyline and fails to engage viewers.The new characters introduced in the film are forgettable, and the returning characters lack depth and development. Additionally, the humor feels forced and falls flat, with jokes that lack originality and charm.While the animation is once again top-notch, with beautifully rendered cars and landscapes, it feels like a missed opportunity to explore the world and its cultures more fully. Ultimately, Cars 2 is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to its potential, and I would give it a 4/10 rating.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Cars 2....IS IT GOOD???,........THERE ARE NO SPOILERS.......THERE ARE NO SPOILERS........... CARS2 is a movie that is aimed at kids. So what purpose would my review serve? NONE. I am not going to go into how good Pixar films are. I am not going to say that they can't all be winners. The truth of the matter is this. The movie is aimed at kids and not adults. If you take your kids or grandkids to see this or any other movie and they enjoy it then that is all that matters. The people who have written negative reviews are not looking at this movie from the perspective of a child. If they like it then gosh it must be a good movie. There is action in this movie and older kids may find the story to be more interesting then the first installment. I myself did enjoy the movie. I certainly did not think it was as bad as the reviews would lead you to believe.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not pixar's best,"When I heard another cars was coming out, I couldn't wait to go see it because I loved the first movie and could watch it over and over again. But after the movie I was disappointed with the it(cars 2). It seemed very long for a pixar movie and half way through my cousin whose 5, started getting bored and started playing with a little toy car. To me it seemed a little confusing for little kid, unlike the first one where the concept was easy to grasp. It is not the worst movie by pixar, but it isn't as good as the other movies they've made. They also made the movie more about mater ( lightnings best friend) instead of lightning McQueen. It got quiet annoying after mater kept doing stupid things. It is an OK movie, but be prepared to be sitting for a while.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
I don't know why the people expected more of Cars  2,"Cars was the worst Pixar movie ever, without imagination and creativity. The plot is copied of ""Michael J Fox - Dr Hollywood"". The difference is that in one you have doctors an in the other cars. For me is boring ans slow once McQueen get lost in that forbidden town. you can't get watermelons if you seed pineapples. Pixar did their first great mistake (the first one was Bugs and the second is Cars), but this one is silly and only searching for incomes instead to continue with that way giving us mature stories as Up & Wall-E. They believe the kids are stupid, but the best sequence in Pixar movies was the story of the couple of UP. The kids really learned about life and death.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The story line is garbage, but the plan for the villains is pretty smart, the time I watched this and actually understood their plan I was pulling for the villains because it's a clever plan.

Lacks the magic,"Cars 1 was a great movie. It had a great story and it touched on characters that you grew to love as the movie went on. Cars 2... Not so much.Story - This one really stars Matter, with all others being part of his story for the most part. Instead of being grounded within Radiator Springs, we find a the familiar characters we know rolling around Europe.The whole movie is a pseudo James Bond spy film with slapstick thrown in. In no way would I have expected this type of story to make up a Cars movie but that's the direction it went in. There was nothing to make this film truly stand out. The additional characters seemed hurried when compared to the first movie. Sort of a toss in without any back story. I am more then sure that a better story could have been done and it should have been really.Video/Audio - In general Pixar fashion the movie looks great and sound is also great. There is nothing to complain about as you know what to expect after years of watching fine quality computer animation at work.Acting - Can't really rate this as easily as other movies. It is voice acting after all, but in saying that it delivers what you expect. Again, Pixar sets bars for others to strive towards.Overall - This is a great movie for kids, they will love whats going on screen and will love the comedy. As an adult you can easily miss this one and not worry if your missing on something special. The movie is not bad so much as it simply doesn't live up to the first. Then again few movies do.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Not as good as the first, but still an enjoyable PIXAR animation","First to say that it was not as good as the first film but that aside you will still enjoy this film, it's PIXAR, no matter what they do it will still have some substance. Starting off with the positives, I loved the whole cultural and spy genre addition to the film. The film focuses on Mater and it's more of a self discovery of his character than about Lightning McQueen which was quite cool. They travel a lot in this film and you see Japan, Italy and England which was really good, and it felt so real because of the brilliant animation. The new characters voiced by Michael Caine and Emily Mortimer as spies were a great addition to the film. However, I hate to criticise a PIXAR film but for a sequel it felt a bit relaxed, in a way of thinking ""Cars was great, we don't really need to develop anymore"" until the whole spy plot kicks in but it should have thrown itself into the new plot instead of lingering from what made the first one great. Just like how ""Toy Story 2"" felt like a great sequel. But you will still enjoy this film for the great action and how cannot you not resist a PIXAR animation, they know how to make an animation.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A different genre for franchise.,"""Cars 2"" plays like a kiddie version of ""Fast and Furious"" crossed with ""James Bond."" Cars do not anthropomorphize as well as their forefathers in Pixar's ""Monsters, Inc."" The film shifts the focus away from Lightning McQueen and onto his dim bulb sidekick Mater. ""Cars 2"" is intended to prepare children for the vroom-vroom genre garbage that Hollywood will feed them in the coming years. It's a little perplexing and only intermittently engaging.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nice,"The film tells the story after Lightning McQueen won the Copa Pistão for the fourth time, and now he will compete in the World Grand Prix, a championship that brings together the best runners from around the world.Story: The story isn't bad, but it's not good either, it's that kind of story where you come out of the theater and say ''it was cool,'' which is not normal for Pixar movies, saying ''Wow, what a movie epic!''. I think Pixar was wrong in wanting to turn the movie into a spy movie, secret agents etc... And that's what took all the ''magic'' from the first movie, the cool thing was to see Lightning running on the tracks, to do Spectacular overtaking, with a grand finale, something that is hardly second to none.Soundtrack: It's good, okay...Characters: In animated movies, there's always the one character that's the favorite, most fun, in this one, clearly it's Mate (and in this movie he's the main one basically). The other characters are pretty cool, but nothing to stand out.Final note: Cars 2 is a great animation, but for the Pixar pattern, it's weak, the story was the biggest problem, they told it very well, but it should have been different.Film reviewed on the 24th to the 25th of August 2021.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Cars 2,"Cars 2, was directed & written by John Lasseter, again, but co-directed by Brad Lewis this time. He's produced titles like Ratatouille, and has been a voice over in The Incredibles & Ratatouille, so he's no stranger to the Pixar family. Cars 2 was a highly anticipated film, but it clearly fell flat, and missed the mark completely! John Lasseter gave us a messy, unwanted, unoriginal spy sequel. First things first, they should've scrapped EVERYTHING about the spy scheme, and expanded on building Radiators Springs! I was personally excited to see them expand on it, but they decided to go cliché once again, and do a stupid world tour. With the reputation that Pixar has of building worlds, this one was just okay, but could've been so much better, and focused. This may be far fetched, but I got this weird vibe of Rocky 3 & 4 in this film.Owen Wilson returns as Lightning McQueen, but as an underlining character; he just didn't have much to do. McQueen seemed to have matured off screen, but in the first set, it seemed like the same arrogant McQueen, mixed with the nice guy attitude as well. After the heavy foreshadowing first act, the film basically became super predictable and all about Mater. Larry the Cable Guy hasn't lost a step, as far as his comedy and stature goes. If you like his character, you'll most likely enjoy this film. If you are one of those people who have a negative opinion on Mater, you're most likely going to strongly dislike this film. As much as I love Michael Caine, Finn McMissile, and everyone else affiliated with the spy scheme, should've been abolished. I didn't care for any of their characters whatsoever. Professor Z is just a cliché bond villain, that the writers try making important, but he just sucked.The screenplay by John Lasseter, Dan Fogelman & Ben Queen had their fair share of okay jokes, but it wasn't as cohesive as the first, and seemed a little forced at time, including the world cultural jokes.We got more action this time around, but that doesn't necessarily mean it was better. The racing, courses, and foreign car designs were very cool, but all of that kind of took a back seat to the stupid spy theme they were going for. The cinematography and animation was visually beautiful, with so many colors, that stood out more than the first film. The art directors created this beautiful European atmosphere, with realistic looking back drops, that I personally don't really care for in an animated film.Overall, I hate to say this because I really enjoyed the original Cars but, Cars 2 is in the bottom three for my least favorite Pixar films.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A fun, sleek and engaging film, it just lacks the Pixar heart","The Pixar library stands as modern animation's most impressive by far, partly due to both the studio and Disney's belief that sequels should only be made with the right artistic reasons in mind, namely a good story. That's why, to date, we have just ""Toy Story 2,"" ""Toy Story 3"" and ... ""Cars 2"" ... ?The original ""Cars"" has largely been considered the worst of the Pixar movies, in the same way that Pluto might be considered the worst of the nine planets. So why create a sequel? The answer that's hard to hear is that ""Cars"" has done incredible merchandising business compared to the other Pixar films. The less cynical answer would be that its director, Pixar head honcho and young boy at heart John Lasseter, loves the ""Cars"" universe — a lot. ""Cars 2"" plays out as a fantasy for a 6 to 10-year-old boy, one that cares much more about sheen than story, despite Pixar consistently championing that phrase the other way around.In fairness, ""Cars 2"" does everything a sequel should in terms of widening the scope, upping the action and improving the overall visuals. Pixar set the bar for technical mastery in digital animation and every animator and member of the production team meets that standard if not exceeds it. It's the story under the hood that struggles, choosing fun as its main objective as opposed to heart.And ""Cars 2"" has fun by the tankful. Lasseter, Brad Lewis and Dan Fogelman's story takes the ""Cars"" universe and throws ""James Bond"" into it, a cocktail most definitely shaken and not stirred. The film introduces British secret agent cars Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holly Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) who are trying to find out what the dastardly Professor Z (Thomas Kretschmann) is up to at the World Grand Prix, a new race sponsored by Sir Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard), an adventurer who is now promoting his new alternative fuel source.Meanwhile, Lightning McQueen has been busy racing and winning championships when he finally returns to his old pal Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) in Radiator Springs. It's a short vacation, however, as Formula 1 race car Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro) has challenged McQueen to the World Grand Prix. He accepts and brings Mater to Tokyo with him, where our secret agents believe Mater to be an American spy helping them out.Most surprisingly, Lightning McQueen takes a back seat in to Mater in this film. Agreed that Mater is one of the funnier supporting characters that Pixar has written and in this film he's equally if not more hilarious, but McQueen's quest to be the best is completely inconsequential. There's a moment, as is in just about every film where the message is about friendship, when he spurns Mater and then later tries to make amends, but it happens so early on. Any emotional impact the film could have had is zapped thanks to this and the fact that McQueen has no bearing on the spy plot.The real problem with the story of ""Cars 2"" can ultimately be attributed to the fact that it does not necessitate being told in a world where the characters are all cars and other vehicles. The same story could have been told with human characters and nothing would have changed. The car aspect serves only as the chance to be clever with a number of car-related jokes and gadgetry.Disappointment will resonate with a lot of Pixar fans, yet the truth is ""Cars 2"" is such a well- oiled machine that it's much easier to discuss what the film lacked than its strengths. The action, the wit, the cleverness and the impeccable visuals we've come to expect from Pixar make it a first-rate animated film. However, we've also come to expect an emotional pull, the feeling of being on the verge of tears for even just a bit. ""Cars 2"" doesn't deliver that at all, nor the feeling of artistic purpose. It feels like a studio making the best movie it could with the pieces it already had in place from its financial successful 2006 film.At the same time, if ""Cars 2"" brings in enough money that it funds another three years of powerful, intelligent and emotional original films like ""Up,"" ""Toy Story 3"" and ""WALL*E,"" I can deal with that.~Steven CVisit my site! moviemusereviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Pixar's Weakest Film To Date!,"From its debut in 1995 to its most successful film in 2010, Pixar Animation Studios released 11 feature-length films, almost all of which went on to garner them acclaim, love & respect from critics n viewers around the world, completely reinvented the animation industry in the process, and also turned this animation powerhouse into one of world cinema's finest.But everything that has a beginning has an end & there's always a first time for all things. And Cars 2 marks something of a first for Pixar; it's their first critical failure which ultimately marks the end of the winning streak the studio had kept alive since its inception. However, what's even more disappointing is that they actually decided to make a sequel to Cars!Cars 2 follows the story of race car Lightning McQueen & tow truck Mater who together travel to Japan & Europe to take part in the World Grand Prix, arranged by a former oil tycoon to promote his biofuel. But when Mater inadvertently costs McQueen his first race & is asked to leave by him, he ends up finding himself caught in an international espionage.Directed by John Lasseter, Cars 2 takes everything that was wrong with its predecessor & turns it even worse. I don't really know if Disney pushed Pixar for this sequel because of the billions of dollars it earned through Cars' merchandising or if Lasseter truly wanted to return to the picture that barely managed to keep its streak alive. Either way, it definitely isn't Pixar-level cinema.The plot adapts the same clichéd international espionage we're seen many times before & this is coming from the studio that always brought something new to the table. The runtime is much longer than it needs to be, characters in this franchise were never interesting but now, they're annoying too. Its timid attempts at humour falls apart on most occasions. But its computer animation does carry the Pixar trademark.On an overall scale, Cars 2 is an unnecessary sequel that shouldn't have existed in the first place. It might be the best one can come up with when having Mater as the lead character but when the first film already warned that people are not interested in these characters, then making a second chapter was absolutely pointless. All in all, after continuously raising the bar during their rise to the top, Pixar at last comes crashing down with Cars 2 & the fall has been so traumatic that it's yet to fully recover from it.",,Anonymous,Animation
Still better than most everything else out there,"I have to say that after the previous years of Pixar entertainment, ""Cars 2"" was probably the most shallow of any of them, yet had probably the most complex plot (as any good spy flick should). I'm surprised to see the low ratings for this compared to a lot of the other over-rated dreck out there. For example, ""Rio"" looks spectacular, but the plot is borrowed from several other Disney movies and the writing is right on par with George Lucas or James Cameron. ""Cars 2"" is as beautiful if not more so than ""Rio"" and the writing is considerably more solid. Is it Pixar's best? Nope. It's probably Pixar's worst. But that's like saying a diamond has a few flaws in it: it's still more valuable than most of the other gems out there. Pixar has raised the bar so high that anything shy of another world record is a dismal failure.

"Too long for young children, not funny enough for adults.","Having taken my best friend's son to the cinema for Cars 5 years ago, i eagerly settled down to enjoy the next instalment with the same child (now aged 8) and his little sister. (aged 3) To say i was disappointed is an understatement - I am currently watching the original on BBC1 and 20 minutes in I am already enjoying it more than today's viewing of Cars 2. Little gems such as Mater's ""He did WHAT in his cup?"" were not there to add the adult humour to the film and a running time of near on 2 hours meant my friend's (nearly) 4 year old was bored nearly to tears by then end of it! In my opinion Disney / Pixar have left it FAR too long to bring out a sequel, a sequel that should, in fact have never been made as there have been other films since that are significantly better. It lacks the depth of Toy Story (in as much as a kid's film can have depth) and the likability of Monster's Inc - it also lacks the ""aww"" factor of ""Up"" and felt to me as if Pixar were trying too hard to make something to suit all ages and failed in the process. Although Cars 2 is funny in parts, it is in NO way as good as previous Pixar treats and I was sorely disappointed, as was my friend's little boy who LOVED Cars so much my best friend and I were almost ready to buy shares in merchandising for it!

A Rare Missed Swing For Pixar,"On the surface, it didn't seem like there was much cause for a direct sequel to this franchise, but given their track record I had to give Pixar the benefit of the doubt. In reality, it didn't take long for those early worries to be confirmed. This is like a jumbo-sized TV episode with incredible production values but a weak, redundant script. Where the original was, clearly, the worst of Pixar's properties, at least it had an honest message at heart; that the abundance of interstates and high speed traffic has ruined the necessity and charm of small-town America, at once mourning and celebrating that lost taste of cultural charm. By comparison, there's really no reason for Cars 2 to exist. It's a straight-up Saturday morning cartoon, shifting from caper to caper without the benefit of a discernible moral. And while there's really nothing wrong with that - there's an insatiable need for kid's fodder on the big screen, certainly - it's depressing to see it coming from the same company responsible for generation-transcending classics like Monsters Inc., Toy Story and Up. While it'll undoubtedly sell plenty of toys, this was the wrong movie at the wrong time for Pixar, and a rare instance of the studio losing ground to the competition.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Meh for me... Maybe kids will like it more!,"I have two younger half brothers, each 5 and 3 and they are both die hard Cars fans. They have seen the original movie at least 100 times and even my parents have managed to pick out the little things because they've been forced to see it so many times. As a treat, I decided to take my 5 year old brother to Cars 2 (because the 3 year old really doesn't like to sit for an entire movie). I wasn't expecting it to be a super awesome sequel but awaited what was in store for me.I have to say I was bored many times throughout the movie, it seemed too serious with the spy aspect going on and at many times felt way too advanced for children. I chuckled a few times throughout the movie, but my brother wasn't responding nearly as much as he did to the first film. I wanted to see more of the old Radiator Springs cast, and I thought Mater already had his moments of fame in all of those Cars Toons shorts.It was interesting to see what happened with the plot, but as I said to me it was presented in such a boring fashion, and there were many technical things (going all out about car parts and such) that would go over many kid's heads. Now sure that might be included for the adult audience, but it didn't entertain me it only made me ask: Why are they putting all of this automobile technical mumbo jumbo in a kid's movie?

Actually a really clever film!,"My actual rating is 7.8 but given how low the overall score, I need to give it a 10 to try and bring up the average.Where is the ""lesson"" in this movie? Mater who everything thinks is an idiot and a fool, proves that even with all of his seemingly lack of social awareness redeems himself at the end.There is also a message about being embarrassed by your friend who might be socially awkward, wanting to change him/her rather than loving them for who they are. Being accepting of others, no fight is worth losing a friendship, having the courage to take a stand even when others doubt you and accepting your imperfections (especially the ones from your friend) like the dings on the cars.So to me, there is plenty of morals to be learned and they did it with great intricate detail to the homage of cars. The creators really went to great lengths to make sure the content was true to facts. If you know automobiles, then you are smiling when they make car references including cars which were considered lemons. Yes, the Range Rover was a lemon, just like the Hugos, Gremlins, Pacers and many others. I also loved the play on words and names they come up with. It's cute, funny and ingenious! The double entendre are just hilarious.Is it suitable for children? My opinion is we don't give children enough credit.

Where is he in this film? relegated to side character while Mater (one of my least favorite aspects about the original ""Cars"") takes center stage. To top it off we've now introduced spies into this movie series. Why? why did we need spies? and let's not forget the AWFUL puns. ""Tow-kyo""? ""HARDY HAR IT""S LIKE TOKYO. BUT CAR RELATED."" BIG BENTLEY GET IT? I'm sorry, maybe I'm not the target audience for this film, and maybe I'm just a big stick in the mud, but I fail to see how anyone, even a child could enjoy this miserable train wreck of a film. I had high hopes for Pixar's latest film ""Brave"". I've yet to see it, but after seeing ""Cars 2"" I'm not even sure if I want to.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enjoyable,"It is true that this film is not like others Pixar films. But it is not acctualy so bad. Many review-writers is telling that this film is huge disappointment,and I think it is not true. I think that expectations was too big.So,this is story about cars. About one friendship. They are completely different,but they are best friends. There is lot of nice,simple humor in the story. The scenario is ""smooth"" and it is easy watchable. There are much of action,surprises,cool techniques,like in James Bond. Yes,we could not expect that,but it is really OK .The characters are in many different places and they are meeting a different people. Characters are 3D,they have feelings and we feel empathy about them.But,there is a ""dark side"" of film,which is not like Pixar. Enemies,propaganda and that stuff. These problems confuses and my 10 year old brother. It is not ugly or violent,it is just confusing to kids.About animation,I will not discuss. It is still Pixar;great animations and visuals and everything about it.This is family film and it is really relaxing and enjoyable. Maybe sometimes is confusing,but it is not acctualy so bad. Because of action and messages that film gives: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Your answer was Larry, the Cable Guy?","Beautiful to look at and funny, but only about 50% enjoyable when it comes to the plot, the long awaited sequel to Cars (2006), finally arrived on the silver screen. In the first movie, the main character is Lightning McQueen voiced by Owen Wilson, the young hot-shot race car that learns the ways of life after he is stranded in the town of Radiator Springs, but because of the passing of Paul Newman in 2008, who was the voice of McQueen's mentor Doc Hudson, the film-makers were handed a tough task of reworking some of the characters for the sequel.Unfortunately, not only do they pick the most annoying character from the first film, but he gets top billing over Wilson's McQueen. McQueen's character gets shoved aside and is almost non-existent. He is reduced to just being a race car racing in the World Grand Prix. Larry the Cable Guy, as Mater, the annoying, unfunny, rusty tow truck, just kills the movie. The one saving grace for the film is an interesting espionage, James Bond, part to the story, with Michael Caine as Finn McMissile that creates a neat dimension to the film, as McMissile tries to stop a conspiracy involving a new alternative energy known as Allinol. Caine is a great James Bond even as a car. If it weren't for long stretches of scenes featuring Mater, the writers did something more with McQueen and the espionage stuff; this may have been a great movie, couple that with a lackluster soundtrack made this a tough one.7.5 (C+ MyGrade) = 7 IMDB",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent sequel,"Having read through reviews, I did not quite understand the negativity.First off, I totally enjoyed the movie. That's the most important aspect to movies for me - I usually want to be entertained.I will speculate why others may not have liked it. They compared it to Cars, and it was different, and it was not what they were looking for.So when you see the movie, treat it as an action movie, rather than part sentimental part action movie like other Pixar offerings.I enjoyed Mater's adventures quite a bit. To be honest, even in the first movie, Lightning McQueen's character can be a bit annoying. So I did not mind the break. I am not a fan of any of that blue collar comedy stuff, but Larry the Cable guy is quite amusing as Mater, who is obviously the star in this movie. Deal with it! :) The animation is AWESOME. Check out the buildings in Europe. Amazing. The bright glowingness of Japan. Cool. When in London, look at all the details, such as traffic moving across the Tower Bridge. It made me happy to see such craftsmanship in the animation.Car fans should love all the car talk. How can you not love a movie which highlights the ""failures"" we laughed at in the 70s, such as the Gremlin! They had some fun cars you don't often see, like the 3-wheeled car (and I have seen some 3-wheeled mini cars in museums, so fun.) F1 fans should appreciate the appearance by David Hobbs - they even used what sounded like real F1 engine sounds in one scene. The race scenes, all too short for my tastes were well done - some of the most fun racing animation I have seen.If you like action movies, spy movies, gadgets, state of the art animation, car jokes similar to all the flintstones rock related jokes, references to lesser known cars and Mater, how can you not like this movie? Just don't expect the same movie Cars was (not that Cars was superior, it was a different type of movie.)",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"11 Hits, and Finally a Miss","Cars 2 (1:46, G, Imax, 3-D) — other: talking animals, biggie, sequelI would like you to stop for a moment and reflect on the wonders Pixar has given us thru the years: A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALLE, the beloved Toy Story trilogy, and of course Up, the 1st 7 minutes of which are worth the entirety of most animated features. Every one a winner. My least favorite of their offerings was Cars, and even there they proved that they could take the unlikeliest of protagonists (egotistical race car Lightning McQueen) and make it almost as endearing as an ant, a big furry blue closet monster, a gourmet rat, a voiceless mobile trash compactor, and a clownfish with a withered fin.There's never been any question about the incredibly high technical quality of Pixar's animation, but more than that they never lost sight of the fact that the story came first, and that's what's made them the most revered name in animation.So let's remember all the gratitude we owe them for 25 years of excellence as we stay away from the regrettable Cars sequel in droves.This film is loaded with way too many vehicles going way too fast to keep track of, way too often. Not as loud as Transformers, not as disjointed as Speed Racer, these are nonetheless only faint mitigations for an over-emphasis on short-attention-span theater. Flash, dash, and smash is a video game, not a story line.Not that there isn't plenty of off-racetrack plot. Way too much, in fact, far too complicated, and presented much too hastily and sketchily. It mainly involves James Bondian spy games concerning peak oil and corporate corruption. Believe me, I am totally the target audience for that kind of message, but even I found it uncomfortably preachy.Top billing in the movie deservedly goes to Larry the Cable Guy, as rustbucket (but nonetheless Lightning's best friend) wrecking truck Tow Mater, a buffoonish hick who was used lightly as comic relief in the 1st film but is determinedly thrust into the forefront here by storytellers who figure they've always won in the past by betting on losers, outsiders, and the downtrodden. It's worked before, but not this time. Shtick like Mater's is a garnish, here served up as a main course, a banquet of parsley.Try as they might, the animators just can't overcome the fact that cars don't really have either expressions or hands. Here the story (screenplay by Ben Queen from a story by Dan Fogelman and co-directors John Lasseter and Brad Lewis) requires extensive use of both, and it just comes off forced and fakey.Y'know, if you were hitting .917 in the major leagues, you'd be the greatest player of all time by a gargantuan margin. Let's not forget that as we note sadly that even geniuses can't hit a home run every single at-bat.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

"It has problems, but it delivers an action packed, comedic punch.","his is a sequel to the first film from the masterminds at my favorite animation studio, Pixar. The film has recently been receiving a huge wave of negative criticism, and it's the first Pixar film that has ever received a rotten rating on Rotten Tomatoes.It takes off five years after the events of the first film, with Lightning McQueen (Voiced by Owen Wilson) now a winner of four Piston Cups. So, he is invited to the first annual World Grand Prix to determine the world's fastest car, and to advertise a new brand of alternative fuel. He invites his friend Mater along, and while Lightning is racing in the tournament, Mater (Voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) gets swept up in a case of international espionage. He's mistaken for an American spy by a sleek, British Intelligence agent named Finn McMissile (Voiced by Michael Caine), and an agent in training named Holley Shiftwell (Voiced by Emily Mortimer), two cars seeking to bring down a plot to take over the world by a league of old fashioned, more broken down cars.The recent reception mentioned earlier had made me a bit gloomy, as I'd hoped I'd never have to see Pixar make a bad movie. And you know what? While it's worth noting that it's their worst film, and isn't among the ranks of WALL·E, Ratatouille, or Finding Nemo, I was incredibly relieved that, personally, I still haven't had to see Pixar make a bad movie. I think it's just as enjoyable as any of their other movies.This is Pixar's second stab at a full on, fast paced action film (The first of which was The Incredibles), and the movie is highly gleeful in its 1960's spy movie tone and stylistics. The plot is like an animated twist on a James Bond film, right down to the cool cars and gadgets, international jumping between scenic locations, even the film's villain, Professor Zundapp, delightfully based on the foreign, scientific masterminds of the James Bond series. That, and Finn McMissilie is clearly an homage to Bond, himself.I do think it slightly lacked the same stellar character development we usually expect from Pixar, and sometimes it feels a little too crowded, but I think Cars 2 has a lot of charming factors that propel it. The action is really exciting, the movie moves briskly, and it's filled with so many hilarious gags. I especially admire the voice-over performances, which also includes the likes of John Turturro, Thomas Kretshmann, Eddie Izzard and Joe Mantegna.The technical side of the film is also utterly amazing. I need not bring up the animation, as anyone who's ever seen one of Pixar's movies would expect it to be of the highest quality, which it is. The sound design by Tom Myers will surely go down as one of the year's best, and I would be a fool not to mention composer Michael Giacchino's thrilling mixture of John Barry and surf guitar. And while 3D is a polarizing factor for movies, I think it really added to the excitement of this one.And now, while I go anxiously await Pixar's next feature film, Brave, I'll most likely be back to the cinema once, or even twice more to give Cars 2 some richly deserved business.I give it *** out of ****",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worth a watch,"That's the best I could say about this movie. While I enjoyed the role given to Mater and the twists in the plot with the almost James Bond like car and the female spy, the story in itself is average and at times a bit confusing. The funniest moment was probably Mater getting stuck in the hifi Japanese lavatory. Also liked the new girlfriend he made! McQueen almost has a side role in this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Easily PIXAR's worst outing to date.,"The Cars franchise is something of a stigma among the collective PIXAR fandom: it's detested by the stingiest fans and for good reason, it's not a movie series that exists for good stories but for the merchandising side of things. When you see the Toy Story sequels and see what makes for GOOD animated filmmaking, Cars 2 is the antithesis of the Toy Story sequels in every discernible way. The characters haven't really changed and the James Bond-styled caper doesn't save the film from its underwhelming story and non-existent character development. With that said, the animation's still good: almost too good for this $200 million production that exists to sell more Cars toys.Cars may boast nice visuals, but the movies aren't the kind which have clear rhyme or reason to exist. Cars 2 is animation done without creative flare. 2/5 stars.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
car spy caper,"I liked this movie and thought it would be cute for kids and adults. It's sort of like a James Bond spy car movie. I also liked that the main character this time was Mater, the hick tow truck. I think Mater's voice is very funny sounding and I just like the dumb remarks. Mater joins his best bud, Lightening Mcqueen, on a trip around the world as Mcqueen is racing in a world car race. Mater is mistaken for a spy and is put in some funny situations. And the 2 cars that are the good ones, working with Mater were cute too. And I thought the whole plot of why the one car went bad was OK, it made enough sense.FINAL VERDICT: It's cute, check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The look is impressive,"The look is impressive but not more than anything else Pixar's done. With each movie, the studio has pushed the graphics into new levels. Each movie has had some wow moment where audiences can't help but be amazed by what they're seeing. There were times in Cars 1 when it looked almost real. Cars 2 lacks any wow factor. One of the most impressive sets, Tokyo, were already spoiled by the Tokyo Mater short. This more than anything makes me wonder if Pixar was even trying to up the ante or if they were just using what they had to make a movie a year.Spies and Cars seems to work well together. After all, any Bond or Bourne film will easily demonstrate why the two go together. Indeed, the opening scene on the drilling platform is easily the best with the fast chase and cool gadgets. But they weren't able to properly combine the racing and spy elements, almost as if you're watching two movies at once. There's too much spy stuff for the racing to be interesting, which becomes pointless against the overpowering and overly clichéd spy story. Perhaps Pixar should have set it as simply a spy movie set in the Cars universe and had McQueen and his friends in cameos or as a background story.Another lousy spot is the music. Cars 1 had a terrific soundtrack with excellent uses of popular songs like Life is a Highway and Route 66. But there's not one memorable song or music cue in this movie. Giacchino usually does terrific work like with The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and Up. But he too fumbles the ball here. Perhaps he was just uninspired by what he had to work with.Cars is Lasseter's pet project. But I think he's too close to it. He's got that Lucas Star Wars prequel trilogy problem. The people around him either were in awe of the man who made Pixar and Toy Story or they were afraid to hurt his feelings since he loves the Cars franchise so much. Pixar efforts have been so well done because they were collaborative efforts, each fixing each other's problems to make a better project. But with Lasseter off working more directly with Disney, he really should have had a co-director or perhaps given the reins to someone else like he did with Toy Story 3.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Tuned,"Pixar does not treat its viewers like children. Literally as can be seen in this case/movie too. And that is what I like about their movies. They don't make the movies thinking about what kids would like to see, as they have often stated. They make movies they love to watch themselves. And while Cars (the first movie) might have been the ""worst"" movie Pixar has done so far, it was still way above some other animated movies from other studios.Still as much as I love Cars 2 (and giving Mater an arc), this probably will be the year remembered, when Pixar didn't win the animated Oscar! But back to Mater: He might not be everyones cup of tea and he has an accent that some might not like from the get-go. But the car is funny.

"A film more adult than would be desirable, where Pixar insists on giving the stage to funnyless secondary characters.","The ""Cars"" franchise was one of the great successes that Pixar masterfully capitalized on, both for commercial purposes and to cement its top status in the field of digital animation. I remember that these three films were accompanied by such incisive (not to say abusive) merchandising that it seemed that the films were being foisted on us. That explains why I preferred not to see them at the time.If the first film seemed quite regular to me (very good from a technical point of view, but with flaws in the script), this sequel managed to at least maintain the technical level and visual quality. The film has excellent cinematography and graphic work, as is the hallmark of the studio. Realism is excellent, although I felt that it is not as impactful and grandiose as in the first film in the franchise. I also felt that the car races, which were the strong suit of the first film due to their emotion and speed, lost much of their emotion here and sounded much more monotonous. The voice actors continue to do a very good job. Owen Wilson and Larry The Cable Guy secure the most notable efforts, but are closely followed by Michael Caine (with an unmistakable voice), Emily Mortimer and John Turturro.Where this film really failed was in the conception of the script and the story. I understand the reason why they decided to make Mater the main character: both Disney and Pixar have done this recurrently whenever a secondary character appears in the films that seem to stand out. And as in other cases, the result of the decision was extremely disappointing. Mater is not funny, more ridiculous than funny, and McQueen, who is in the shadows this time, is just another pretentious, obnoxious, arrogant driver. Dialogues don't always work well, and some jokes don't either, although most do. I also have certain reservations about the division of the film's action into two subplots (Mater's and the rivalry between McQueen and Francesco), I believe that this made the film much more adult than would be desirable.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
So bad,"Just saw this movie last night with my husband and our 11 year old. It was so bad, seemed like it was thrown together in about a week by a team that just wanted to get it done.'Mater is the main character. The plot sort of centers around him being stupid. That's it for a little over an hour and a half. It tries to be touching and poignant in parts but just embarrassingly fails. I didn't care about any of the characters.And I agree that it should not be rated ""G"". The violence and ""dark"" plot didn't bother me so much, but I can understand other parents' complaints.

Proof of the old adage that money destroys art,"It was only a matter of time before the money changers took up residence in the temple. As pioneers of a new art form (the CG feature length) Pixar had a good run but this is definitely their fall from grace.There really was no reason for a Toy Story III in my mind although many would beg to differ. Almost everyone agrees though that Cars II was completely unnecessary and nothing more than the type of money grab Disney has become infamous for.It was bound to happen of course. Disney itself was one of the great pioneers of a new art form in the early years of the twentieth century (animation itself) but any new medium will always suffer once it becomes profitable and industrialized. I've been a fan of Pixar since day one however so, although I knew this was inevitable, seeing this in the theatre tonight was bit of a sad moment for me.As a humour and action packed eye-candy diversion it's still up there amongst the best of course, which is why I'll give it something and say I don't feel like I wasted the price of my ticket, but as a Pixar feature it was a major letdown. This was only enhanced by the reuse of the Toy Story universe for the ""opening cartoon"". (Day & Night was the last piece or inspired animation to come out of the studio in this viewer's opinion.)The Brave trailer did look promising though so here's hoping the studio will continue to release some story driven gems in between the profit driven product releases.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly better than the original,"I didn't like Cars. There, I said it. Go ahead and throw your tomatoes at me. So I didn't go see Cars 2 in theaters because I didn't think I would like it either. But then I finally decided, once it was released on DVD, to give it a try.Now, I don't regret not seeing it in theaters because I wouldn't put it on my list of favorite Pixar movies. But I liked it much better than Cars. Now I will admit, The Incredibles is my favorite Pixar movie and it's pretty violent (but by action movie standards, it's relatively tame). But I actually thought Cars 2 was more violent and I was pretty surprised at the death toll. In fact, I'd have given it a PG rating as well. But while Cars didn't make me laugh at all, Cars 2 made me laugh a few times. Mater definitely held the movie together while McQueen who, in my opinion, is the more boring character is just supporting.Actually, I guess what I'm saying is that if you didn't like Cars, you'll probably like Cars 2. And I find it kind of funny that the percentage of critics who gave Cars 2 a bad rating is almost equal to the percentage of critics who gave Cars a good one. Coincidence? Probably.

Lacks the charm and old fashion appeal of the first film,"I think I would like this film a lot more if it wasn't a sequel. It is a goofy parody of spy caper films; the plotting is absurd enough to be really fun and a lot of the gags really land. I owned a Gremlin at one point and yes that model is evil. The story about a couple of friends getting in way over their heads after a falling out is fine for a colorful animated family film. Add that this is quick paced adventure, has solid action scenes and the film is very exciting. But it is a sequel and that is where the film really suffers because it doesn't gel with the first film.Cars (2006) was a story about how the big city racer learned to slow down and appreciate the simple pleasures of small town life. McQueen in the first film was an arrogant hothead racing through life too fast to connect to his elders, culture and (real) folk. (The film has pretty strong popularist vibe to it) This film inverts that structure-the country bumpkin, Mater, is the protagonist who learns the world isn't so simple and sometimes you have to think quick on your feet..umm...wheels to thrive, survive. Further, the first film had a distaste for modern technology speeding up to fast-it had a fondness for the ways and people, like Route 66 and its denizens, that modern technology could leave behind. This film is positively in awe of the power of technology.The inversion of the structure of the films make the two films different from each other but this one ends up worse off because of it. Mater works better as a supporting character. His rustic charms can get annoying-and the plotting around them strained-after awhile. McQueen's rivalry story is not resolved and is just dropped because of the overall plotting; as the protagonist of the first film this is harsh and unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the animation style and the characters are really rooted in American car culture of the 50's-60's. Cars is still the most distinctively American Pixar film. This film's larger geocultural scope is at odds with the the quaint Americanness of the films' aesthetics. It is not that Britain, Japan or Italy are not rendered is lush, detailed carform-because they are-it is the globetrotting plot abandons the tone of the first film so completely.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Pixar's first disappointment,"As time has passed, Pixar has proved us to go one step ahead from other animated production companies, by being our number one choice on the category of ""Best Animated Film"" at the Oscars, by always giving us more than the expected, (Just like they did with ""Wall-e"" and ""Up!"") or by managing into getting animated movies to get an Oscar nomination for ""Best Picture"". They never settled with an OK-job, they always aimed for excellence. However in Cars 2 they didn't prove it so. I can't complain about the excellent visual effects and the majestic settings, but the script just didn't prove to be Pixar material. It was a risky move taking a supporting character and giving it a leading role, which didn't work as well as I expected. I'm not saying the movie sucked, I just think they could have done a better job, and it was Pixar's worst movie yet. (Not bad, but still the worst).I think, among their other fascinating animated pictures, they could have made a sequel that created more expectation on the audience like ""Monsters, Inc."" or ""The Incredibles"".I also understand they abandoned a project named ""Newt"" because of budget trouble, to focus in producing the sequels ""Toy Story 3"" and ""Cars 2"". In the case of ""Toy Story 3"" I completely understand, but in the case ""Cars 2"" I think it was a stupid decision. However I won't lower my Pixar expectations. I expect them to give us what we want in their next film, ""Brave"", and to continue making excellent jobs in the future.

Now my don id 7 years old and his youngest brother is 2 years old and we took them to see CARS 2. They LOVED IT. Cars 2 is not made for adults it is made for kids pure and simple but Cars 2 grew up with it's audience. the theme is the same it is about friendship and being there for your friends and This time it is also about not being afraid to be yourself. The Story is not complicated which is good because it is a kids movie after all and those should never be too complicated. There is more action in this one then the first one and maybe a better story in this one then the first. The only drawback is no Paul Newman who sadly died before he could take his part as Doc Hudson . But We did Get Michael Caine as Finn Mcmissile a secret agent in the James Bond mold.

The first misstep for Pixar,I love Pixar movies and shorts and I enjoyed the first Cars. But I can honestly say that this is Pixar's first misstep. Let me start with the excessive violence that this movie presents. It's opening sequence alone makes me question some of the decisions Pixar make of this movie. The graphics continue to be stellar but the story is subpar and that's what we go to Pixar movies for. Also with Pixar their previous films are as entertaining for adults and children which is not the case for this story at all. It has too many adult themes and is kind of boring for children. Lastly this movie is preachy and lacks the usual heart found in previous Pixar films.,4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very Disappointing,"If it hadn't been Pixar or the sequel to Cars, I may have rated this a 7. Mainly disappointed that Pixar just produced something to get people back into theaters and didn't worry too much about story telling. My son was able to sit through it but wasn't too excited afterwards. He chose a spider man toy over one of the new characters when we stopped by the toy store after the screening. I'm guessing that's his way of saying ""not too engaging""... This review needs to be at least ten lines so I just have to keep typing stuff. Nothing else to say about the movie. Just filler stuff right here. More of it right here. And it keeps going right here.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
My 7 year old got bored,"In the family we're all big Pixar fans. We loved all their movies, know all their shorts, even use lines from Finding Nemo. My son was a big Cars fan.We sat through Cars 2 but none of the Pixar feel was there. The visuals are spectacular and detailed, but the spy story itself is too convoluted and ultimately uninteresting and the humor is crude. I think we laughed twice during the whole movie. By the end my son was ""yeah, whatever"". Later that day we watched Rio and we enjoyed it much more.Cars 2 is not only inferior to other Pixar movies, it's inferior to other new animated features. Cars was never the strongest Pixar piece but it had enough sweet childish fun to be enjoyable. Cars 2 looks like a different company with no clue tried to copy the concept.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Entertaining fun,"OK, so maybe Cars 2 doesn't peer into the meaning of life like the Toy Story series, and maybe it doesn't look into universal human truths like Wall-E or Up. However, it doesn't have to. Not all movies need to aspire to the heights of philosophy. Cars 2 was beautifully animated (sometimes breathtakingly so), laugh-out-loud funny at times, and in general, a fun summer popcorn movie that has a broad appeal.It would, though, have been nice to feature the supporting characters a bit more heavily - I missed Sally and the Radiator Springs crew. However, it was good to see a strong female character featured, which in the animated world, is rare in non-princess movies. It was also fun to see some of Luigi and Guido's back-story.My only minor quibble was that it was perhaps a bit more violent than it could have been (or maybe should have been, given the young age of the average Lightning McQueen fanatic). However, the violence was usually kept at acceptable levels (comparable to ""Kung Fu Panda,"" I'd say - just with explosions rather than karate chops).Like any Pixar movie, there are hundreds of references to other movies, pop culture, and history sprinkled through the film which will require many repeated viewings to pick up. (Of course, anyone with kids will end up viewing it repeatedly anyway, so being a parent of a small child, I personally appreciate this feature!) So, while Cars 2 won't be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, or likely a Best Picture Oscar, it was definitely worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
OK............. But disappointing,"Having been a long time Pixar fan, I can say that this is a big departure from other ""classics"". There is some charm, but for the most part the movie is much more violent and complicated than any other Pixar film I can think of. My father in law struggled to follow the story - and it's convoluted enough it's hard to articulately explain. Whereas Cars had a classy charm to it and a memorable soundtrack, this lacked a likable story and any music that was the least bit interesting. I can't believe that Cars 2 actually came out of the same studio. It's not terrible, but you shouldn't see this movie expecting any of the ""magic"" and innovation that Cars had. This movie is all explosions and drama.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is what happens when Disney takes over.,"This was NOT a Pixar film. It does not belong in the pantheon of previous Pixar films and SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN MADE! Brad Bird made a comment once (I am summarizing here) that he respected Pixar because they protected stories. I wonder what he would say about THIS absurd story. I hope this isn't the beginning of the end for Pixar. Pixar, please don't do this again.I have been a fan of Pixar since I watched my first Pixar film, Finding Nemo. I have watched every Pixar film multiple times and have never been disappointed ... until now. I have even been to (but not in, because they do not give tours) Pixar's studios in Emeryville, CA, so I think my credentials as a Pixar fan are well established.I expected something like this would happen once Disney took over. Pixar needs to throw off the shackles of Disney and go back to being an independent company, or at the very least John Lasseter needs to stop directing movies.

Even a Pixar Film Can Miss The Mark,"¨-Finn McMissile, British intelligence. -Tow Mater, average intelligence¨I'm glad kids don't read my reviews because they would probably disagree with everything I have to say about this film. The kids I saw the movie with in the theater had a blast and thought this was the best film they've seen. I on the other hand felt the story was really weak. When it comes to a Pixar film my expectations have grown exceedingly high, and they're to blame for that because with Toy Story 3, Up, and Ratatouille I've come to love Pixar movies for their heartfelt stories. Cars 2 on the other hand is missing that important aspect: there is no heart in this film. The story is loaded with a lot of action, it's simple, predictable, and the jokes are mostly targeted towards kids. Young audiences will be pleased, I'm OK with this as well, but I know Pixar can do much better. Cars 2 won't remain in my mind like the characters from Toy Story or Up did. It is light entertainment and many adults will be unpleased with the movie. I know other adults will be glad that their kids enjoyed the film so much so they won't have complaints about Cars, but for those of us who really enjoy these Pixar films on their own we know this movie just didn't live up to expectations. It's like the producers didn't even try and relied on the known characters to entertain the audience without worrying about writing a better story. Kids love spy movies so all they did was turn Cars into an action spy movie and voila: we got Cars 2.Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has just won his fourth consecutive Piston Cup and is heading back to Radiator Springs after another successful season in racing. Doc Hudson is gone, but McQueen has dedicated yet another trophy to his mentor. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) is the most excited about McQueen's return, and Sally (Bonnie Hunt) is also glad to be back with her hubby. McQueen is looking forward to spending some quality time with them, but Mater convinces him to enter the World Grand Prix race which is being sponsored by multi billionaire Sir Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard). Miles has invented a new type of green fuel and the cars will be using it for the races. McQueen's biggest competitor is Italian Formula 1 racecar, Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro), a cocky driver who drives the ladies crazy. The race however is only the subplot because once Mater arrives in Tokyo he is mistaken for a spy. Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) are British spies who are after Professor Z (Thomas Kretschmann) who seems to be trying to burn the Grand Prix by making the cars using the alternative fuel blow up. The British spies confuse Mater with an American spy and so he inadvertently becomes immersed in the action. Mater becomes the lead character in this film, and McQueen is just a supporting one.John Lasseter and Brad Lewis couldn't bring back the magic in Cars 2 that they had brought to their previous films. The first film wasn't one of my favorites among Pixar movies, but it certainly is much better than this sequel. One of the major problems I had with it is that Mater took central stage and I don't think his character had what it takes to be the lead. He was always meant to be just a supporting character for other more depth characters like Lightning McQueen. The visuals are stunning as always. There are some scenes in Tokyo, London, and Italy that are just breathtaking, but the story falls way too short. Cars 2 is entertaining, but it's just missing everything that Pixar has accustomed us to. Little kids won't be disappointed; they will have fun with all the espionage and explosions, but adults looking for a heartfelt film will be leaving wanting and expecting more. The fun was targeted almost exclusively for kids and some adults may find this movie lame and predictable. Other Pixar films have made us enjoy going to the movies with our kids, but this one might make adults think twice about going with their kids to the movies and perhaps sending them with their nanny's the next time. I was disappointed with Cars 2, but only because Pixar has done way better in the past. It's not terrible, just light entertaining fun for the children.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Dishearteningly bad,"Pixar's Cars was easily their weakest feature, yet it certainly had a charm to it. While the car characters themselves looked a little cheap, the world they lived in had nice, pretty detail, and their Rocky Mountain hometown was lovely. Cars 2 not only replaces Cars as Pixar's weakest, it's actually dishearteningly awful. It jettisons every ounce of charm from the original, as well as the detail (probably because it was made as a 3D movie, so the backgrounds aren't going to be seen anyway), and puts Larry the freakin' Cable Guy in the lead (Owen Wilson's Lightning McQueen is barely even in the film, and would probably be like fourth billed if not for his contract). This film belongs on the shelf next to Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector and Witless Protection, not Wall-E and Up. The plot has McQueen and 'Mater (Larry's character, if you don't know) going around the world to a series of races so McQueen can prove he's the fastest car alive. 'Mater is mistaken for a secret agent by a James Bond-like Michael Caine-mobile and Emily Mortimer and has to foil an evil plot by someone or other. I really couldn't be bothered to give a damn about any of it. It's very busy, and I'm sure small children will like it, but it's vapid as Hell. It really feels like one of those Disney direct-to-DVD sequels, possibly even worse. Let's hope Pixar will learn its lesson from this one.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Just because it's not emotional, doesn't mean it's a bad movie","Cars 2 is a amazing film that tackles the deal with self image perfectly. The story is about Lightning McQueen and Mater getting their friendship tested as Mater goes on his own very fun spy adventure with his new spy friends. Cars 2 storytelling is done so well. You can really relate to Mater and how he thinks he needs to be like everyone else when all he needed to be was himself. Not so boring guy who changes himself just to impress others. The spy plot with new cars such as Finn McMissile and Holley Shiftwell is super fun and engaging and the action scenes will get you on the edge of your seat. My favorite part of the film is how it tackles dark themes. They aren't as obvious like The Incredibles but they are there. Themes such as public identity, resource pure crisis, and the issues with friendship that an adult or child can relate too. Cars 2 visuals are outstanding and are candy for the eyes. It looks so realistic despite the world being runned by talking cars and ships. Overall, Cars 2 gets too much hate for being different but it's a very fun movie with great messages and story.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Absolutely terrible,"I honestly can't remember the last time a movie annoyed me as much as Cars 2 annoyed me. I'd always heard this was Pixar's worst movie, but I was shocked to find it was actually this bad. I don't think I'd ever have the mental energy to rank my own personal bottom 100 movies of all time, but if I ever did, I'd save a spot in there for Cars 2.Every movie made by Pixar prior to Cars 2 is a good movie (and most are great), with the exception of the first Cars. I really don't like that movie, but it's not irredeemable. There is a story of sorts within that movie with some kind of a character arc for its main character- a bad plot and a badly done character arc, mind you, but it's there. There's also some nice looking visuals and a couple of funny jokes in that first Cars.There's nothing good in Cars 2. All the jokes are terrible. The animation genuinely looks cheaper, especially all the backgrounds and wide shots, which look empty and lifeless. That stuff can be excused more in the earlier Pixar movies, but not in a post-Ratatouille/post-Wall-E/post-Up world.Things go from bad to worse with the main plot, and its focus on the comedic sidekick from the first movie, Mater. He becomes the main character here, and he's honestly one of the worst characters in the history of fiction. I hate him with every fibre of my being, and the movie seems to assume we'll like him, and even wants the audience to feel sorry for him at points? Come on!This is the turning point for Pixar. They've released good movies post-Cars 2, sure, but they just hasn't been the same. The first Cars put a dent in that golden age, but didn't destroy it, considering their run from 2007-2010. 2011's Cars 2 did kill the Pixar golden age, though. It's shocking, and arguably the worst theatrically-released animated film of all time. Anyone involved with the making of this movie should be embarrassed- it's an infuriating watch from start to finish, and no matter how hard I try, I can't find anything redeeming.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

In fact, bond fans will not even be disappointed by the action!Cars2 shifts the focus from Lightning McQueen to Mater and gives you some high class action sequences in the process. Larry the Cable Guy is as usual great as Mater, but the surprise pack is Michael Caine as Finn McMissile. It'll take you about 5 seconds to recognize his impressive voice.Watch Cars2 for entertainment..only!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Kill Lightning McQueen""!............Inappropriate.","I really like Pixar films, but I've always regarded ""Cars"" as the weakest Pixar offering - I would give that film 7/10.Now this one - Cars 2; I verged on actively disliking this film. I particularly disliked the call - given by the Baddies; ""KILL LIGHTNING MCQUEEN"". I'm sorry - but this just isn't suitable for the very young following that a film like this is bound to attract.Not only this; there is a lot of blasting and blaming, cars fall into the sea and are evidently drowned. There is quite a lot of low/medium level violence. I didn't like any of that and I think it's inappropriate. There are actively nasty dislikable characters.The film itself is weak. It's sort of about misunderstandings and friendship, I think. But it comes out all twisted.OK - It's fairly fast moving, it's very colourful. But on the other side - it's silly and actually a bit boring.The first cars film was very mild and child-like, but Cars 2 goes in quite a different direction, a direction I didn't feel comfortable with.

I think its a lot more darker then the first movie 4. I think this movie should get a better then 6.5/10 5.

Feels like a straight-to-DVD short stretched out over 106 minutes,"Pixar's Cars is now remembered as one of the great studio's rare misfires; a formulaic animated movie that had far more to offer to the children in the audience than to the adults paying for them to be there (although I think it's one of their most misunderstood movies and well worth a re-visit). Despite this, it was a box-office smash and a dream in terms of merchandising. A few years ago, Pixar may have thought twice about extending the story of Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) and the town of Radiator Springs without having something new to say, but ever since Disney took over, they've taken a more relaxed attitude towards bending to audience demand and churning out an underdeveloped and unworthy sequel. The result is Cars 2, a mess of a movie with an absence of any real laughs that feels like a straight-to-DVD short stretched out over 106 minutes.Now a four-time Piston Cup champion, the world-famous Lightning McQueen returns to Radiator Springs to see his old friends, much to the delight of best chum Mater (Larry the Cable Guy). However, formula champion Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro) challenges McQueen to join him in the World Grand Prix, an event created by Sir Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard) to advertise his new fuel Allinol. McQueen, along with Mater, Luigi (Tony Shalhoub), Guido (Guido Quaroni), Fillmore (Lloyd Sherr) and Sarge (Paul Dooley), heads to Tokyo, where Mater's buffoonish behaviour starts to grate on the racing star. Meanwhile, weapons designer Professor Zundapp (Thomas Kretschmann) and his cronies are taking out cars using an electromagnetic pulse in an attempt to scupper Axelrod's plans and secure oil profits. This catches the attention of international super-spy Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and his partner Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer), who mistake Mater for a fellow spy and hire the clueless tow truck to help with their mission.This may sound like a bold move for a franchise built on low-key themes of friendship and humility around a traditional fish-out-of- water story, and Cars 2 fleetingly captures the imagination as McMissile swings onto an enemy oil rig, gadgets at the ready. But this is no longer Lightning McQueen's story. Instead, they push Mater, the comic relief best served in tiny doses, front and centre. Not only do his shenanigans increasingly annoy, they are also painfully unfunny. Many of the memorable supporting cast from the first movie are either heavily sidelined or given the boot altogether, and the story is so disjointed that it's difficult to keep up with the endless roster of forgettable, newly-introduced characters. Kids will love it though, and that's all that really matters when it comes to box-office receipts. There's enough colour, slapstick and racing action to keep them on their seats, and the animation again is truly wonderful. While this may get a pass if released by Dreamworks, mediocrity never used to be on Pixar's radar, and the high standards are still expected. One need only look at their Toy Story trilogy to see how inspired their sequels can be, which makes the middling antics of Cars 2 all the more crushing.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Cars crashed,"Do I even bother? I liked this as a kid. Why? I have absolutely no idea.In Cars 2, Lightening McQueen takes to the world stage and races against global racers. He struggles to keep up with the best of the best. However, while this is all going on, somehow Mater falls into being a spy. There's like a conspiracy and espionage and a whole pile of strange dealings.The issues with this movie can be broken down as four things. Firstly, they introduce a really mediocre set of characters that fails in comparison to the set of characters from Cars 1. There's a reason none of them feature in Cars 3. They don't have personalities and are barely more than just thoughts.Secondly, the plot doesn't really go anywhere. There are so many changes in direction it feels stationary. The plot twists feel like they were thrown in last minute. Who came up with this and thought it was a good idea? Like I sat there in such a confusion. I, an adult, couldn't work out where it was going at all. One of the best parts of spy movies is guessing what is going to happen. But you can't even do that, because the information required isn't revealed until forty seconds before it is revealed. Frustrating is an understatement.Thirdly. I just can't with the soundtrack. The soundtrack of Cars was brilliant. The soundtrack of Cars 2 is comparatively nothing. I didn't feel like it had really anything to do with the actual movie. And it's not the songs chosen are bad, they aren't. It's just they don't feel like they were thought out and placed with the same intention of Cars. I read up about Cars and they picked Chuck Berry song that his record company didn't even know existed. That same level of thought was not put in for Cars 2.Finally, I have a theory. I think Pixar wanted to make a spy movie. And they realised that it would be hard to create spy characters that kids could empathise with and tell the entire story they had planned. So they did something I have never seen Pixar do before. They didn't even try. They just bent tried and tested characters to a story they like and rolled with it. I am sorry but for me that is not good enough.I don't know if I have ever been so disappointed. Really not worth watching.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
More exciting than Cars!,"This is a Disney/Pixar sequel about hot-shot race car Lightening McQueen who travels to Japan with best friend Mater for the World Grand Prix. While McQueen tries to win the race, Mater gets himself caught in the path of Holly Shiftwell and Finn McMissile, spies on a mission to stop a sabotage plot created by old cars called ""lemons.""John Lasseter and Brad Lewis did a great job in directing this movie, grasping the audience's attention from the start with a thrilling espionage sequence. The story then picks up steam pretty quickly with McQueen getting himself into the Grand Prix race by Mater and then inadvertently getting Mater into the espionage ordeal. With all the spies searching for clues to the ""lemons"" trying to sabotage the good cars, the plot gives you good ol' fashion spy movie excitement and quite a lot of thrills and suspense.The entire voice cast did a nice job in their respective roles, making the characters memorable. Owen Wilson continued with his convincing hot-shot personality of McQueen, Larry the Cable Guy did his country-old style personality of Mater, Michael Caine did a nice job voicing Finn McMissile with his British accent and Emily Mortimer did a charming job in voicing Holley Shiftwell. I enjoyed seeing the various the human traits exhibit in the car characters and also enjoyed the terrific visual/special effects and animation work, especially capturing the splendid scenery of Tokyo, Paris and London.I thought too much emphasis was placed on Mater and not enough on Lightening McQueen. But, overall, I believe this sequel is more funner and exciting than the first Cars movie - definitely worth the watch by the entire family!Grade B+",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Where did the Pixar magic go?,"Technically the film is flawless. Seeing the film one can't help admiring the progress CGI has made over the last decade, and the use of 3-D is not bad throughout the movie. You'd think that when Pixar's admirable staff couples with its obvious technical advantage, they'd be hit the bullseye again, and... the results are borderline disastrous.There is a great premise here. Actually, a few premises that go nowhere because there is just too much happening, but it is all muddled as we try to keep up with a spy plot that is nothing but uninvolving, as it is herd to tell the good guys from the bad guys, and then we have the simpleton stuck in the middle of it, the fish out of water, the friendship angle, and all the cute stuff that might have been added in order to bring some charm here, or maybe it was just there because they could afford it.It is a constant gabfest, and even the wondrous visuals feel bogged down as we have to constant to an endless series of conversations that are neither amusing, dramatic or clever, just way too long and at best flat. Pixar works best when the drama is clear, personal, simple. Who can forget the amazing personalities of the trio in ""Up"". The characters don't have to be people, look at Kevin and Dug. The family in ""The Incredibles"", and many more come to mind. There is just something forced about the characters in this film. They're underdeveloped, and we're supposed to like them. It's even more detrimental when the opening short has the fantastic characters from ""Toy Store"" take on a faux vacation and squeeze every possible laugh out of the short.It is at least disappointing, and well, there is always an annual offering by Pixar, and next year's should be much better.

THIS is a G-Rated Movie?,"Throughout the entire time I was watching CARS 2 in a theater crowded with VERY young children, I found myself wondering if maybe I'd just misremembered the actual MPAA rating for this movie. I was pretty sure that the theater marquee, the ticket-purchasing website, even the movie's own marketing materials all stated that this movie was rated ""G"", ""Suitable for all audiences"", by the MPAA. But the on-screen product was telling me something far different. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, we see:-- Cars ambushing a secret agent car (with the strong implication of a violent confrontation);-- A warship turning guns on a fishing trawler, and;-- A nail-biting car chase on an oceanic oil rig that wouldn't be out of place in a Bond or Bourne movie, complete with another spy car faking ""death"" after being shot at by a rocket launcher.And, sadly, that's not even the WORST of what purports to be a ""G""-rated family film dishes out for its unsuspecting audience of kids and their by-now-shocked parents. A MAJOR plot point of the movie involves the villain using an instability in an alternative fuel source to deliberately blow up race cars using that same fuel. Yes, you read that right: A movie that features anthropomorphic cars as its characters has several scenes of anthropomorphic cars turned into unsuspecting bombs by their fuel source. This is as inappropriate for a ""G""-rated movie as it would be to have humans exploding because one of their food sources turns them into unsuspecting IEDs. This is not a movie for young children by any stretch of the imagination, and I'm not sure how a movie with this level of in-your-face explicit violence and mature content could possibly have gotten anything below PG-13.Unfortunately, it's also not a movie likely to appeal to older children, teens, or adults. The storyline is convoluted, and even an adult friend who saw it commented on how tough it was to follow all the plot points. The message of the movie gets completely lost in all the espionage nonsense; if John Lasseter is trying to make some point about corporate machinations getting in the way of truly pursuing alternatives to fossil fuels, he needed to make it a lot clearer than turning race cars running on ""Allinol"" into bombs and tossing in a throwaway line near the end about how McQueen escapes the other race cars' fate. And speaking of McQueen, he and most of the Radiator Springs residents are either missing completely or simply reduced to extras needed to fill out a scene. If you're not a fan of Larry the Cable Guy or the Tow Mater character, you should just skip this movie entirely, because Mater is front-and-center as the lead in this disaster.This isn't to say that CARS 2 is completely without watchability. The visuals are amazing at times, and the level of detail in some of the scenes serve as a reminder of why Pixar is the undisputed King of Animated Features. And the opening animated short featuring the Toy Story characters is simply brilliant. It's also, alas, the best thing about CARS 2, and it's over in less than 5 minutes.CARS 2 is a huge disappointment as a movie, and the one good thing that could come out of it is a serious discussion about creating a rating that fills the gap between ""Suitable for all Audiences"" and ""Parental Guidance Suggested"".",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

From Radiator Springs to International Espionage,"I absolutely loved Cars 2! Pixar has once again proven that they are masters at creating sequels that are just as amazing as the original. This movie, much like the Toy Story films, captures all the sincerity, excitement, and flawless animation that made the first Cars movie so great. From start to finish, it's a visually stunning film with incredible voice acting, including a surprisingly fantastic performance by Larry the Cable Guy.In this installment, Lightning McQueen, voiced by Owen Wilson, has settled down in Radiator Springs with his girlfriend Sally Carerra, played by Bonnie Hunt. However, he is convinced to participate in a three-country race by an Italian Formula One car voiced by the hilarious John Turturro. Of course, Lightning brings along his loyal best friend, Tow Mater, brilliantly portrayed by Larry the Cable Guy, who adds a lot of humor to the story.To make things even more interesting, all the racers are required to use a new alternative fuel created by eco-warrior Sir Miles Axelrod, voiced by Eddie Izzard. But when some of the cars mysteriously explode during the first leg of the race in Tokyo, doubts arise about the safety of the fuel. Little do they know, the real culprit is using electromagnetic pulses to disable the vehicles, with the intention of blaming the fuel and returning to the use of oil. However, British agent Finn McMissle, voiced by Michael Caine, and his new partner Holley Shiftwell, voiced by Emily Mortimer, are on a mission to stop the mastermind behind it all. And that's where Mater comes in.Cars 2 is not solely focused on Lightning McQueen; he takes on more of a supporting role. Instead, the story revolves around Mater, who unknowingly gets involved in the world of espionage when the British agents mistake him for one of their own. This creates a conflict between Lightning and Mater, as McQueen blames Mater for his loss in the first race. The theme of friendship and loyalty is beautifully portrayed, as Mater's clumsiness and lack of focus put their bond to the test.The race takes us to Milan and London, where Bernoulli, voiced by Turturro, and McQueen engage in witty banter and insults, with Bernoulli often coming out on top. The animation showcases breathtaking scenery from both countries, so realistic that you'll feel like you're watching a live-action film. The stunt driving sequences are absolutely mind-blowing, with cars performing daring feats such as jumping off roofs and racing through parking garages. It's like watching parkour, but with cars!I had the pleasure of watching Cars 2 in both 3D and IMAX. I've been critical of 3D in the past, but in this film, it truly enhances the experience. The colors are vibrant, and when something is meant to leap out at you, it does so with stunning realism. The sound design is incredible, making your seat rumble with every engine roar. It's a visual and auditory feast that immerses you completely in the world of Cars.Overall, I would rate Cars 2 a solid 8 out of 10. It's a thrilling and visually captivating film that successfully combines elements of friendship, espionage, and high-speed racing. Pixar has once again delivered a sequel that lives up to the high standards set by the original Cars movie. Whether you're a fan of the franchise or simply enjoy animated films, Cars 2 is definitely worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"So wrong, so bad and so uninteresting!","First of I want to make it very clear that I'm a huge Disney/Pixar fan. I own all of the feature length films they have ever put out on DVD, I watch them regularly and I enjoy them very much. To me what makes them special is that they represent the highest quality of animated films in that while they are expertly executed and produced they are also imaginative, innovative, interesting, engaging and funny. This goes, in my opinion, for all of Disney/Pixars 14 feature length films out on DVD with the one sad exception of Cars 2.The story in itself is without a doubt the weakest and least imaginative of all the Disney/Pixar movies to date (I haven't yet seen Planes, but I'm not exactly holding my breath for that one either). I fail to see how the executives at Disney/Pixar could be fooled by a plot that is so thin and uninteresting that it makes the Tinker Bell movies seem levels above.And what on earth possessed Mr. Lasseter to make him ""okay"" the ridiculous levels of violence and weaponry displayed in the movie. And how did he think that a spy movie would be interesting to children. I have watched it with children ages 8, 9 and 12. They all had a hard time following the plot, and while the smaller ones were scared at times the big one simply wasn't drawn in at all.As others have said before me, it seems that this movie (and the ""Planes"" spin off) was only made to make money on more merchandise. What I don't understand is, why they had to change the whole concept of the first movie ""Cars"" that centered around old fashioned values and friendship into some deranged global good/bad war over fossil fuel/CO2 neutral fuel. I just don't get it. And I didn't like.I can't recommend this film to anyone who liked the other Disney/Pixar movies. And I must say that it has been a great relief to me that Brave and Monsters University both proved to be back to the old standards - and I'm very apprehensive about Planes...",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best film in the Cars franchise,"Watched it twice on the same day. The film had me hooked. Mater is such a fun character. The direction is really good. The film looks great. The voice cast is excellent. There is a whole sequence with a bomb involved, it was truly exciting to watch with my kids. My little ones loved the friendship between Lightning and Mater. This is a film that kids will love. The humour will be appreciated by both kids and adults. This is my second favourite Pixar film behind the orginal Toy Story. And this is one of the three Pixar films that has insane repeat quality (the other two being Toy Story and Ratatouille). Watch it now if you haven't seen it already. Ka-chow!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Never gets out of second gear.,"In the modern age, people typically associate the pre-conceived quality of a film with its director or cast, but very rarely do entire studios develop a similar reputation. Pixar is the best example of this, having churned out mostly excellent films that have forever changed the phrase 'fun for the whole family' (once loosely translatable as 'a yawn-fest for anyone over five') and created movies that are designed for kids at their most basic level, but can genuinely be enjoyed by people of all ages. And while I wouldn't consider Cars 2 right up there with Pixar's greatest accomplishments, it isn't a total flop either.Having just won the Piston Cup, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is looking forward to some down time in Radiator Springs. That is until the cocky Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro) appears on television, proclaiming that he is the fastest racecar on the planet. An appeal to the contrary by McQueen's best friend Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) sparks the first ever World Grand Prix. Intertwined within this story is secret agen-err car, Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) who enlists the help of Mater to thwart the plans of the evil lemon cars, sick of being the laughing stock of the world.Character-wise, the most noticeable difference in Cars 2 from the original is that Mater has made the jump to lead protagonist, while McQueen appears on occasion just to tie up the loose ends and advance the plot. The entire secret agent story is fantastical and a far cry from the more intimate setting of the first film, although that is unlikely to phase the film's target market. I could have gone without it, and yet cutting it out completely turns Cars 2 into a forty-minute TV special, as opposed to a feature-length presentation. So this is definitely a case of 'I don't know how to improve it, I just know I don't like it.'I can understand applying the 'bigger is better' formula to such a sequel, but the increased screen time enjoyed by Mater is actually a detriment, as a character that outlandish is best taken in small doses. Having said that, the film does its best to draw sympathy from the audience in key scenes. We genuinely feel for Mater when his feelings get hurt, but such heartfelt moments (that have become one of Pixar's greatest weapons) are unfortunately dealt with all too quickly, and swiftly pushed aside to make room for the next big set piece.Visual gags dominate the humour landscape of the film, which again should come as no surprise considering whom the film is aimed at. Because the events of this movie occur all over the world, it allows animators to apply all sorts of racial stereotypes for a cheap laugh. McQueen's Italian rival talks in a thick, cheesy accent, is painted the same colours as his national flag, and lists soccer as his favourite pastime. Comedy is not the film's strong suit, and generally fails to deliver any fresh material that may have otherwise made the film more engaging for us older kids.Two minor areas in which Cars 2 falls flat are, ironically, two areas in which Pixar tends to excel. The film lacks a quality villain, one that appears genuinely threatening and capable of instilling fear like, say, Toy Story 3's Lotso. Also, subtle in-jokes regarding the state of pollution in the world, as well as the impending need to switch to alternative fuel feel uncharacteristically forced. Naturally, these moments are intended to fly right over a younger viewer's head, but they felt like nothing more than a guilt-trip to me.Upon this film's release, many were inclined to argue that Pixar has finally sold out and produced a film solely for merchandising purposes. While this may be true to some extent, it's important to remember that it is only lacklustre by Pixar's high standards, and could have been far more painful under a lesser studio's supervision. Sure, this sequel does no more than simply go through the motions for ninety minutes, but remains a bearable (albeit somewhat unfulfilling) experience.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
I LOVE this film!,"I have seen every single Disney movie, and Disney Pixar movie, and I feel that this movie in NO WAY falls short. Many critics are calling the story line too confusing or complex for younger audiences, but let's be honest - all children's movies contain hidden story lines that only older audiences can fully grasp. My eight year old cousin follows it easily, in fact he even explained some of it to me. Children younger than that don't look for anything more than the obvious storyline they can see - that there are cars and they are friends and they race. Every child I have talked to has loved this film, and seeing as this is Disney's target audience, I say this film reached its goal. What's more is, if the story line was less complex, adults would have the same moan or complaint of the age-old ""same-old-same-old"" story line, the complaint of all Disney movies being the same with different characters. This film is different, and yes it has ditz and dazzle, that's what kids like.I was not expecting so much from a sequel, as films normally drop in greatness in sequels. But this film blew me away, gave Mater the recognition he deserved whilst keeping Mcqueen in the front lines, and the characters did not change who they are from the first film. It was brilliant.Great film Disney :)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Just okay, but not much more then that.","My children and I had anxiously awaited the release of ""Cars 2"" since we first heard Pixar had a sequel in the works a few years ago. I am disappointed to say that ""Cars 2"" falls into the same unfortunate category as many other sequels, where it just doesn't live up to or exceed the original.Don't get me wrong, I love Pixar movies and I watched it from beginning to end, but even it's occasional humorous moments weren't enough to keep me from boredom with the storyline. I felt like I was watching a movie that was clearly made for no other reason but to up the figures of the ""Cars"" franchise. My children, 6 and 10, both said it was ""just okay"".Since this is not the lamest movie I've ever seen, I'm giving ""Cars 2"" a 3 out of 10. I do wish I had waited for the $1 DVD rental instead of paying $6 per ticket to see it so soon after release and in a theater.Come on Pixar, I know you can do MUCH better then this! You've carried the ""Toy Story"" storyline high and strong, keeping it fun, fresh and entertaining without losing the magic that the original wowed us with years ago. Please do the same for the ""Cars"" storyline or else do us a favor and put it out of it's misery.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
CARS 2: A hidden masterpiece,"Cars 2 is one of the most outstanding pieces of media of the 21st century. This film is without a doubt Pixar's magnum opus, and we are all lucky to have been alive to experience such a movie. The media may have conditioned you to believe that Cars 2 is the lesser of the Cars trilogy, but that is without question, the result of lobbying from big business and the mainstream media. This film elicits emotions that I was unaware I could feel.The highlights of the film is undoubtedly the characters and action. Finn McMissle is the James Bond of the film and he plays that role with class, and his dry wit really creates an unforgettable performance, with all credit going to the legendary Micheal Caine. The villain of Cars 2 was also an icon in modern day antagonists, setting the foundation for lesser copycat villains such as Zemo, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and Thomas Kretschmann successfully creates a both infuriating but sympathetic villain, which is the true mark of a good antagonist.The film focuses on developing major, as the story of Lightning McQueen has very much been explored, taking a more risky but just as gratifying protagonist, who gives a heartfelt performance which will irrefutably go down in history as one of the most beautiful character arcs to ever be seen. Sally was a baddy also.The action scenes in Cars 2 are unparalleled in any animated movie, the transition from fight scenes to chase scenes, is mostly seamless and it nether fails to grasp the viewers attention, with the humour rarely falling flat.Cars 2 is one of the best films I have seen, don't let peer pressure tell you otherwise, and enjoy this phenomenon of a film. Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Car Wreck,Like many I was very impress with Cars it is one of the most clever animation films we had in a long time. That still remains one of my favorite films I saw in theaters.However Cars 2 does nothing to hold water to the first film as a matter of fact it should have never been created it is one of the most disappointing sequels in the history of sequels and it is not even worth being consider a direct to video release.I apologize that is a insult to direct to video releases because there are direct to video releases that would kick this one to the curve.They change the roles of Lighting McQueen and Mater making Mater the story protagonist and central character How could you think that would be a good idea? You can't just switch the protagonists and expect it to work. It can't.The plot for the film totally takes away what makes the first film a joy to watch. It just really destroy it.The animation is very well done and pretty much the only good thing I have say about this film. The voice acting rage from good to just stupid also some of the new characters look better on paper.I give Cars 2 an 5 out of 10 and this is being nice,5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Well, this was unnecessary.","When I said that Cars was a step back for Pixar back in 2006, this one was a giant leap in what could go wrong.The original had a generic predictable story, but at least it was easy to follow. This is first of all not really a sequel and was a mess of different plot lines like this out of nowhere spy story which Mater of all is dragged into, McQueen racing against this Italian formula car and an underlying environmental theme which doesn't really add much else than a forced pay off.Aside from the weird spy story I think it was wrong to make Mater the overall star of the movie, because while we get a few glimpses into how he feels being seen as an idiot most of the time which can add a little to the story, he just can't run (or drive) from the fact that he acts like one. If you're a big fan of Mater, this sequel to the weakest Pixar outing may be for you.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fast paced adventure,"This film is about Lightning McQueen racing in the World Grand Prix, and during the process his best friend Mater unknowingly gets involved in covert spy operations.""Cars 2"" is fast paced, and the story is full of adventures. The characters are all very cute, with individual characters to make them distinctive and recognisable. McQueen is charming but is relegated to the side, as the very annoying and always talking Mater is the true lead star in ""Cars 2"". There are many adventures in the film to thrill, and I am particularly entertained by the unsurprisingly large amount of car chases. All the scenes are brightly coloured, creating a joyful and exciting atmosphere. ""Cars 2"" has all the right ingredients to be an entertaining family film.",,Anonymous,Animation
wait till it comes out on DVD,"This was a horrible disappointment after ""Cars"". The character development is practically non-existent and the whole ""big oil is evil"" is just blatant demagoguery. The ""characters"" that made the original movie--the quirky Radiator Springs residents--are nearly invisible. The only really decent part was the graphics. Basically, this is an animated, dumbed-down spy-action movie with a G rating--and in trying to be two things at once, it does neither of them well. Cute in spots, but hardly worth the high ticket prices. If you really want to see the thing on the big screen, at least hold off till it hits the dollar theaters.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than y'all say it is,I will stand by saying that this is a good movie. The story is fun and all the new characters are great and so is the music.

Something went wrong at Pixar,"It's a challenge to critique movies for which you are squarely not within the intended audience. It's part of the reason why I skipped Judy Moody and the NOT Bummer Summer. While I'm sure we would have done well to get in touch with our inner Heather Graham, we just didn't think it fair to toss a pair of bad grades at a movie aimed at little girls. We'd much prefer tugging on their pig-tails and saying they have cooties. That being said, Pixar has always presented itself as not only the superior animated movie product to beat, it typically produces films that are creatively accessible on multiple levels. In fact within Wall-E and Up there are segments of pretty high end pieces of cinema. So for that reason, we're reviewing Cars 2.Except it appears that this time something went wrong.Perhaps the creators were on a Hawaiian vacation much like Ken and Barbie enjoy during the throw-away Toy Story short that appears before the feature presentation. Yes, I know, I know. We should be so lucky to even get cartoons before our movies. But I remember when these things were completely original shorts that were almost as buzz worthy as the reason why we were in the theatre to begin with. Disappointment sets in early, though Woody and Buzz do try their best to remain relevant past the completion of their trilogy last summer.When it comes to Cars 2, we're treated to what is essentially a James Bond film featuring Larry the Cable Guy's character Mater. Quickly I'm reminded of Arthur and how Russell Brand was in nearly every single scene. Except instead of a man-child out of control Brit, we instead get an even more grating redneck caricature that's more hijinks than ha-has. Mater has been misconstrued as a spy, and there's a whole caper involving alternative fuels. Yes, Pixar is all about the green technology, so you gotta have a bit of environmentalism with your fun as usual.The only problem is there isn't much fun to be had. At least not for an adult. The kids will likely enjoy some of the antics, as Mater screws up things but by doing so manages to solve problems along the way. Lightning McQueen is hardly featured. And everyone should really pay attention to just how marvelously beautiful the scenery is in the three international cities the World Grand Prix takes place in. (An effort included to no doubt boost international box office.) But really the spy story is just kind of lame. Not to mention rather violent for a rated G movie. I mean, cars with guns, rocket launchers, and tasers? So, in conclusion, you probably can skip this movie unless you have little ones. Yes, the visuals are stunning and enhanced to some degree with 3D technology. And there is just a sliver of heart to be found in the midst of all the madcap espionage. But generally speaking, it's all about the annoyance of Mater and marketing so that following the film's conclusion you can buy lots of stuff featuring the Cars brand. After all, when I bought my ticket I was given a small pamphlet that let me know Target has 'everything Cars'.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Gran Turismo undercover (screen),"It was my first experience of ""Cars"" and I find the idea of personalizing cars original and funny. Moreover, it's a change from the always, eternal, speaking animals! Sure it may be deeply industrial but those cars looks like the ones we played with as kids. Next, the clear characterization of the friends, a dumb and an extrovert is helpful to build a plot, gags and a morality.Unfortunately, the production didn't manage to write a decent story around. As I watched the movie with my 6 years old nephews, i have got the feeling after the Japanese round to be in Transformers or Toy Story 3: guns, violence and the villain's scheme is totally beyond understanding.A spy story is already difficult to follow but if in the same time, the bad guy wears a mask, the targeted audience is totally lost: ask my nephews about it and they can't tell what the movie is about. That's why it will disappear quickly from our memories. So producers: stop making brilliant stories and just make it simple!",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
a nice looking film let down by weak writing,"Pixar takes audiences back into the world of cars in this sequel to the 2006 hit. Lightning McQueen, having achieved much fame and success for his multiple Piston Cup awards, returns home to Radiator Springs to take a break and bond with his best friend Mater. Having been goaded by the supercilious Francesco Bernoulli, McQueen decides to enter the World Grand Prix and takes pal Mater along with him, but things quickly go askew when a case of mistaken identity plunges Mater deep into an espionage plot. Fantastic animation (especially key locations throughout Europe), and a stellar cast of voices can't overcome the clichéd themes and convoluted plot which even adults may have trouble trying to comprehend. Shows some life in its third act with relentless action scenes, but the film's overall impact is muted. **",,Anonymous,Animation
Our children have been used for financial gain!,"I enjoyed the first Cars movie. Expecting a similar level of appropriate children's entertainment, I accompanied my two grandchildren (ages 3 and 4.5 -- it WAS rated G) with their grandfather and parents to see Cars 2. As a person who has taught and cared for young children (up to age 8), taught early childhood educators at the college level, and who has advocated for children, I was shocked at what my grandchildren were watching. My husband walked out early. We should have removed the children, but did not -- our mistake. The theater was full of children.Without the violence the movie (plot, etc.) was pitiful -- such a waste of talent.So...in the future I will be vigilant with regards to any movie produced by the people associated with Cars 2. Also, I will not buy any more Cars 2 products. It seems the backers and producers got what they wanted. Perhaps all who were involved in the production of this movie should ""embrace their inner lemon.""",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

dude this movie it stupidly good. I didnt remember it beeing this great. Saw it back in 2020 for the first time. Its hella different from the first one. They took a different route and make a james bond/espionage type of movie as an animated film with cars!!! Crazy asf.I will rate the first one higher due to the many themes and the emotional high!!This one is a bit laid back. They went a step up with this one: greater set pieces and memorable sequences, which, stand alone would be appealing. Infact as a kid i remember so many stand alone scenes from cars 2 in youtube.They honestly couldve just ended it with cars 1. But since it was successful they need to use it to their advantage and made this i feel. And now this one feels like an abrubt end if it were the last movie in the saga. Glad they took a different route.I kinda understand the the criticism and hate it gets but its clearly not meant for the same target audience as that of cars1 (leaving the fact that its made for kids)ps: i cant be the only one who finds those big ships scary right?? Like imagine ur traveling in the ocean u see those big smiling ships with a turrent pointed. Their smile is also scary braaah

A bad sequel to a movie I dislike.,"Having seen the first ""Cars"", it did really seem like a Pixar movie. It seemed to be more like a poorly animated high school project. While I enjoy Pixar's, DreamWorks', and Blue Sky's films, this film and its predecessor just didn't seem to compare to much ""better"" films like ""Ice Age"" (2002), ""Toy Story"" (1995) or even ""Kung Fu Panda"" (2008). Just the same old jokes (which I didn't find funny), and poor dialogue. The humor just seemed as stale as Jay Leno's sense of humor. Please, Pixar! Don't do a ""Cars 3""! In fact, I feel that I shouldn't drive a car after seeing this! At least I didn't see this film in the theater, I waited until the movie was on TV, Blu-ray, and/or DVD. I could only sit through the first 2 1/2 minutes and then shut off my TV.If you want to watch any of 2011's animated films, I suggest ""Rio"", ""Winnie The Pooh"", ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" and ""Rango"".

A childhood classic of mine,"Cars 2 is a pretty unpopular movie in the Cars franchise but I do like it unlike other people as I did grow up with. I find that the movies I tend to grow up with I tend to enjoy a bit and I'm not letting later rewatches or other people hating on it taint my opinion on it. I could see why people might not like it as it is more about the comic relief character and is more of a spy based story than racing. Probably it would be better if it was called Spy Cars and Cars 3 got renamed to Cars 2. I feel like that would help fix what people might complain about it. Again, I still like regardless as I have fond memories of it.This does feature some boats in it and does make me want to see a spinoff about them simply called Boats.

Horrible,"Boring. Just a poor idea of a plot. Mater can't carry the movie, especially with a dead end 'spy-car' premise.

Holy cow. Just terrible.If they wanted it to be realistic, they should have thought of the future, and used ELECTRIC CARS. Then, the plot could have been 100,000 used cars with 70,000 miles on them, getting battery replacement estimates for $27,000 per battery. Couldn't be a worse plot than Spy Cars! And it would be an honest, real life lesson. Better yet, when 10,000 electric cars die on the interstate in Pennsylvania in the middle of a nor'easter, because everybody was using their heaters, the Disney writers could have Mater come to the rescue, with 10,000 1 gallon gas cans full of electricity.

Creating violent movies as Cars 2 is an abuse of the arrogant American film industry against normal people not only in the US but also world wide. America's Culture of Violent Movies Infect the World and Itself. Maybe it's rather dumb, naive, irresponsible, uneducated than arrogant.

It is true that this film is not like others Pixar films.,"But it is not actually so bad. Many review-writers is telling that this film is huge disappointment, and I think it is not true.

The scenario is ""smooth"" and it is easy watchable. There are much of action, surprises, cool techniques, like in James Bond.

"A marginally entertaining Pixar flick, is that really so bad?","**1/2 out of (****)Pixar had a certified fresh winning streak. Starting all the way back from 1999 and ending with 2010, they held a candle to other competitive, blood-thirsty animation studios. The films were packed with solid character development and emotional depth. While it sent tears rolling down our cheeks, it tugged at our heart strings. However, for every undefeated battle, there has to be one defeat, and alas, it is ""Cars 2"". Hold the phone folks! You want to know why? Because this Pixar maniac actually sort of digs this little concoction.Even with all the negative critical reception and the mixed audience reactions, I still walked in with confidence and excitement. Did the movie meet with my fullest expectations? No. But did it do the job? I'd say so. Sure you can argue the emotional depth isn't as deep, but the characters are still there, the story is there, and most importantly, the fun is still there.First off, let's start with the characters. Before going into this movie, so many people were complaining about Mater hogging up the screen. I found that to be untrue. I actually loved Mater. I thought he had such a vivacious personality which in the end shined through and is just that goofy best bud you have. Lightning McQueen is that spiffy 'ol friend who has it all but has a heart and has good intentions. Then there's Sally who's lighthearted and looking out for her boyfriend and her boyfriend's buddy. But now, onto our new slue of cars.Another complaint I heard was too many cars. Too many cars? We must've seen the wrong movie. Each and every car was developed to satisfaction and I thought every performance was a solid one. Pixar still has it in the bag. Furthermore, the animation is just absolutely outstanding. Visually, this is probably an Oscar contender. It's just so beautiful to look at and you're so easily immersed with this beauty.Furthermore, the story. I thought it was pretty neat to try to reach to other countries and have some foreign appeal. Very good tie-in. I also thought the eco-friendly message was great too and this movie is just very strong in morals.And folks, that's where all the positives stop. What are the problems? First and foremost, the pacing. The movie starts out pretty fun and upbeat, but it just sags as the film progresses. Had it not been for the sagging issue, this would be a solid 7. Moving on, the plot is unnecessarily convoluted and rather than exciting the viewer, sometimes leaves it in the dust.Also, if you're wondering whether to pay those hefty 3D surcharges, save your cash. I thought since it was filmed in 3D and it was a very vibrant film, rich with detail and color, that it'd pop. Nope. The same 'ol 2D picture but with an edge. And those AMC IMAX's? PA-THETIC! I saw Cars 2 in IMAX 3D at an AMC chain. Worst. mistake. ever. You pay almost double your ticket for a screen slightly bigger and the sound slightly louder than usual. What a joke!All in all, while Cars 2 has its flaws, what's so bad about them? Every movie has their problems, but all that matters is that the positives outweighs the negatives. As long as that happens, it's all good. I for one know I'll pick this one up on home cinema. It's a marginally passable effort, but an entertaining one at that.",,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar/Disney should be ashamed,"This was a terrible movie in every way. Its a PG-13 movie hidden in animation and certainly not G. We took our 4 yr old twins to this as the original Cars is their favorite movie/show. Unfortunately, everything that was great about the first movie is completely lost in this abomination. Guns, bombs, violence, death...movie is full of everything we don't want our kids exposed to at this age. Its also truly a shame that the great character buildup and friendships of the first movie are completely thrown out here.

Killer TeeVee,"You can see Pixar being as Disney-fied at the same time Disney gets Pixar-ated. In this case, the experiments in a spatial camera all go away while the cartoon becomes an ordinary 3D production. And there's too much story.It is a kid's movie, so you have to have some 'finding yourself' theme, hammered more bluntly than usual for Lassiter. It starts with a noir setup; random guy gets swept up in world dynamics that jerk him around (for the benefit of the audience).

"It's a Pixar movie, ding-dongs!","I don't care what most people say! The animation, voice acting, characters, and story are great in my opinion. This is because it's a Pixar movie, for crying out loud! Lightning is still a great character, and good thing Mater pulled off two funny moments like eating wasabi and winding up in the Japanese restroom! Wasn't that hilarious!? 😂😂But, seriously, the racing scenes are very fun to watch, and the action sequences are actually awesome! It's an example of a comic relief getting the spotlight in a nutshell, yet still a sequel. The death scenes, though, are... Uh... kinda strange but for some, serves the ship right for trying to help Z stop Lightning and Mater!Aside from the vehicle destruction scenes, not too bad, but I'd hate to see Lightning and Mater fighting after the former lost a race once. Speaking of which, it's still a nicely executed sequel.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
It shouldn't have been shot.,"Cars 2 is a catastrophic misfire from Pixar, a studio once celebrated for its impeccable storytelling and emotional depth. Inexplicably pivoting from the charming simplicity of the original Cars to a convoluted, spy-thriller parody, this sequel is a tonal and narrative mess that feels more like a cash grab than a sincere attempt at storytelling.The decision to make Mater-the bumbling tow truck-front and center is baffling. While he worked as a comedic sidekick in the first film, his grating antics quickly become unbearable when stretched to a lead role. The movie leans heavily on slapstick humor and cringe-worthy misunderstandings, none of which land with any sophistication or subtlety. Mater's one-dimensional ""lovable idiot"" persona wears thin within the first act, and by the end, he's simply insufferable.The spy plot is absurdly overcomplicated for a kids' movie, riddled with clichéd tropes and predictable twists. The inclusion of secret agents, international espionage, and world-destroying conspiracies feels completely out of place in the Cars universe, as if Pixar was trying to shoehorn James Bond into a franchise about talking vehicles. It's a tonal whiplash from the heartfelt, small-town Americana charm of the first film. Worse still, the core themes about friendship and identity feel forced and hollow amidst the chaos.Visually, the movie retains Pixar's high standards, but even stunning animation can't salvage this mess. The international settings-London, Tokyo, and Italy-are vibrant but ultimately superficial, existing merely as eye candy to distract from the lack of emotional resonance or coherent storytelling.Ultimately, Cars 2 sacrifices heart, humor, and originality for a nonsensical and tiresome action-comedy that fails to appeal to either kids or adults. It's the cinematic equivalent of a junkyard heap: shiny on the outside, but rusty and hollow underneath. This is Pixar at its lowest-a glaring reminder that even the greatest studios can stumble when prioritizing merchandise over meaningful storytelling. Avoid at all costs.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Meh in the worst way possible,"Pixar making a bad movie was bound to happen someday, and this was it. As a stand- alone animated film, it's just an okay to mediocre kids' movie that is really stupid. As a Disney and Pixar film, it is a huge embarrassment. The main problem with this film is that the comic relief, Mater is the main character. Comic reliefs don't work as the main focus of the film, because they're not meant to carry the film. Most of the time, they just get annoying which is the case for this film. Also, the spy plot is very shallow and awkward considering the first film had nothing to do with spies, and the environmental message is very hammered in. Overall, this film is meh in the worst way possible, because it has so many glaring problems that don't get the film into bad territory.Final Rating: MEH",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Sequels need to be different, and good","A fun filled ride both kids and adults can enjoy. They certainly couldn't copy the first film with location and story, so they had to go all out with the story in a new direction to keep things fresh and interesting. Following the ever popular spy-thriller genre, for me, they succeeded - I love spy thrillers. What's next? Cars from Space? (haha - Carboys and Aliens).I saw this film in 3D, and Pixar never ceases to amaze me. The locations are beautiful, the story is good, and the humour is still there. Pixar sticks adult jokes or references in there that most kids won't understand (like Mater in the washroom, or certain bond references), and locations I have been to recently (namely Paris) were a welcome sight for me to visit in the film.The only thing I can say for sure is that I don't think it will leave an impact as the first film did for me: Cars 1 was really my first introduction to Pixar, when I fell in love with their work. That film blew me away, and I will never forget my experience watching it. The only thing new in this film for me was the scenery and the story.

violence is that all you got,"I loved Cars. And was looking forward to Cars 2. but then I saw the trailer, and I saw the film with my son who is 5 years old. And I say to the makers of this piece of crap:If the only thing you can make is violence and bombs and think that is the moral and corruption of young children's minds we want you better hang up your hat and move to another industry.Why is all the cartoons now a days about blowing the most up, shooting and killing. I mean do you not have any better imagination than that?Cars 2 could have followed the story of Cars. A story of hope and dreams. But no..you wanted bombs and grenades.So this movie cars 2 are banned at our home, my other kids will not see it, and it is not recommended for any kids younger than 13.Can Disney make the beautiful children films they are known for? I mean films of love, hope, happiness, magic etc. That is what our kids want. I am really thinking of stopping all my kid channels on TV Disney, Disney XD, Cartoon network, Nick...etc. Why you ask? well because all the programs are about bombs, violence, fighting, shooting, killing...there are no longer a good moral to the stories, it is about blowing up as much as possible in the least amount of time. So why should I degrade my kids minds with this violence?parents should ask themselves: what future do we want for our kids? when all science point to the fact that all this violence in films is the reason for much of the violence happening for real in the world and right outside our neighborhood. parents should ask themselves: what moral things should we learn to our children, how do we want them to become when they grow up?from a father and nurse to all parents.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

Cars 2 was Pixar's first BAD movie,"Cars 2 started off pretty alright, but it quickly took a turn for the worst. It started in the place we know in love and I liked it, it was chill and fun. But Mater being the main character stunk, a little bit of Mater is good but if you add too much of him you're setting up for failure. The 2nd quarter is where it got bad, no good parts at all, Franchesco was your one of the mill show off nothing more nothing less. It felt so same old same old. Then it got even worse by the 3rd quarter. Mater, Finn, and Holly took up way too much of it with their boring side story. The only good thing was that the the race tracks were cool and unique. They tried to make up ground in the 4th quarter but it was just too late.

"The Name is Mater, Tow Mater","So yesterday I decided to hit the latest addition to the Pixar Family Cars 2, and see if Pixar could still make a good sequel. I'm happy to say that Pixar has once again crafted a fun, adventurous, and entertaining film that will please a lot of fans of the studio's work. However, I must admit that I was surprised by this movie is the amount of maturity in this film and the fact that it is only rated G, but we'll talk about that later.Cars 2 starts out with a fast and flashy sequence of spy car fun as we watch the skilled spy car Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) infiltrate and oil rig fortress. After some exciting chase scenes, clever use of gadgets, and a catchy spy action tune, McMissile escapes and wonders who in the world can help save the world.Cue Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), as we see the happy go lucky tow truck ride down the road and helping people in that innocent manner that made him famous. As he helps tow a poor broken down car, Mater gives us the back story of what Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has been up to in the past, which mainly involves racing and winning the Piston Cup, now named after the Hudson Hornet from the previous film. By chance McQueen just happens to be in town allowing the tow truck and race car to meet back up, in a brotherly fashion, and embark on their classic adventures we saw in the previous movie. After a few minutes of nostalgia, a couple of glimpses of an upgraded Radiator Springs, and that rekindled relationship between Sally (Bonnie Hunt) and McQueen, Radiator Springs is ditched as McQueen, thanks to the assistance of Mater, accepts the challenge of the international race competition.It doesn't take long for McQueen and Mater to begin their international adventure, starting in Towkyo, Japan. Once they arrive in Japan, Pixar's classic moral story begins to come to fruition as we see a classic friendship face the tests of the judgement of society. While McQueen kind of reverts back into the selfish car obsessed with image and reputation from the first film, Mater still provides us with a bounty of laughs as his stupidity and clumsiness is introduced to the world. Here is where I wish to tell you that Mater is the focus of this movie and fans of Mater will not be disappointed by rust covered country bumpkin car. Whether it is mistaking wasabi for pistachio ice cream, spilling stuff on the floor, or awkwardly participating in conversations he is confused in Mater is still as lovable as the first film.The twist to this film though is more about the spy business integrated into this story and Mater's role in the organization. I was impressed by how Pixar recruited Mater into the organization and how they kept his true identity a secret from McMissile throughout most of the movie. Pixar also made the effort to add another level of detail to the movie by also developing the relationships between Mater and McMissile as well as Ms. Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) the new agent in training. However, this is also a kids' movie and most of the younger audience will not really appreciate the character development Pixar has in this film. Instead the younger generation was more interested in the action and excitement the movie had the offer. Pixar's clever mind has once again found a way to make an idea work as they have brilliantly integrated weapons, martial arts, and gadgets into the car universe. I was impressed by how Pixar kept the scenes interesting and pretty diverse which kept the action and gadget use fun. Mater's idiotic use of gadgets and innocent humor was also well balanced and fun which kept me and the rest of the audience into the movie.This brings me to my next topic: the action has made the movie more mature. I was surprised by the amount of explosions, gun use, and death in this movie. A lot of the darkness, evil plotting, and shooting I felt was a bit too James Bond like for younger audiences and seemed to make this movie shift more towards adults. Also I felt the action in this film took away a lot of the emotional buildup the first movie had, which was one of the aspects I enjoyed most about that film. Although Pixar still had emotional development between Mater and the spy cars, it still was as impacting as McQueen's emotional journey with Radiator Springs. I also was not as impressed with the racing scenes as in the first film. The spy action took a lot of screen time, which resulted in the actual race being replaced with small snippets of high adrenaline, engine roaring, or race car taunting, mainly from John Turturro.Overall Cars 2 is one of the better sequels I have seen in a while and is still as fun and brilliantly shot as its predecessor. The voice work is well placed, the action is fun and exciting, and the comedy is still the same throughout the movie. However, I still miss that emotion between McQueen and the radiator springs crew, especially from Doc and wished they would have put a little more involvement with the rest of radiator springs. Overall I give this movie an 8.0 or 8.5 for that same Pixar magic. I again wish to remind parents that there is a little more maturity in this movie than expected and would probably say this is more of a PG movie than a G. Regardless it's definitely worth seeing, especially for Mater fans, and would even be worth seeing in 3D assuming you don't get sick and are willing to pay the price.Until then keep enjoying the movies!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It is fun while you're watching it,"Cars is Lasseter's pet project. But I think he's too close to it. He's got that Lucas Star Wars prequel trilogy problem. The people around him either were in awe of the man who made Pixar and Toy Story or they were afraid to hurt his feelings since he loves the Cars franchise so much. Pixar efforts have been so well done because they were collaborative efforts, each fixing each other's problems to make a better project. But with Lasseter off working more directly with Disney, he really should have had a co-director or perhaps given the reins to someone else like he did with Toy Story 3.I almost rated this movie higher. It is fun while you're watching it, even if as soon as it's over it becomes too easy to pick apart the problems. But this is Pixar. They've dominated the animation market since Toy Story and have been pushing the boundaries at the Academy Awards ever since. To see them stumble with a not-so-great film would be one thing. But they're coming off from two Best Picture nominees to a movie that's simply flashy but with little substance. Kids will love the bright colors and silly antics, but parents will hate having to then buy twelve new Mater toys. Cars 2 is stalled and in need of a tune-up.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

not getting the credit it deserves,"I've read a few of the reviews for this movie on here and felt I needed to add my own piece. I couldn't disagree more with most of the reviews. I thought this movie was wonderful. It was infinitely better than the first cars which while was a cute movie and endearing, but a bit boring, and yes predictable, but its a children's movie, of course its going to be predictable. Disney and Pixar aren't out to trick the audience and keep them guessing, they are out to entertain you and leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling at the end, this is Disney and Pixar not Paramount or Lion's gate, they make family films people. That being said, I thought this movie was very entertaining. It had much more action in it and a great story. Personally I'm glad they focused more on Mater, I think his character is far more enjoyable than the dry and boring lightning mcqueen voiced by Owen Wilson who if you've seen one of his movies you've seen the character he acts out in every single movie he's been in. The animation in this movie was astounding. I graduated from college with a degree in video game art and design, I know first hand what goes into these kinds of pictures and Pixar has once again proved why they are the best 3D animation company out there. Their work is flawless. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone. I find it sad that people are reviewing this movie like its a educated thriller, take it for what it is - an entertaining family film. I brought my son and I don't know who enjoyed it more.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than the first thanks to its blatant stupidity.,"Here we have a film that's more entertaining than its predecessor due to its absurdity, with the bizarre concept taken one step further and pushed to the point of 'turn-your-brain-off' fun. It pretty much provides constant passive enjoyment as the contrived and convoluted plot speeds by without a moment's hesitation. It's light on the emotion but this time it knows it, we don't get any ham-fisted attempts at causing the audience to well-up with expository dumps, and it tootles along with an almost ostentatious streak - helped by some wonderful casting choices, Bruce Campbell included - as the new spy plot is shamelessly mashed with the racing motif from the first in an unsuccessful amalgamation that feels more like fan-fiction than serious sequel fare. It's just about stupid enough to work, though, to the point that you aren't ever really bored. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Fun and Excitement!,"Cars 2 Directed by: John Lasseter & Brad Lewis Written by: Ben Queen Produced by: Denise Ream Released in theaters June 24, 2011My Rating: ★★★★★This film is rated G.Most of the original Cars favorites are back, with tons of fantastic new characters, like Finn McMissle (Michael Caine) and Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro). This time, McQueen (Owen Wilson) and his motley pit crew take on the entire world (Tokyo, Italy, and London) as they participate in a World Grand Prix sponsored by the new green fuel, Allinol. As Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) whole-heartedly supports his best buddy, while sometimes embarrassing him with his redneck quirkiness, he is mistaken by two British operatives for an American government contact. The road gets a little bumpy when Lightning and Mater have a bit of a falling out, and Mater is pulled farther and farther into international espionage. Finally, Mater must make a critical choice that could save his best friend, even if it means the great junkyard in the sky for him.When my oldest son was around the age of my youngest son, he would watch Cars over and over all day, every day! I can probably still recite the entire movie to you, word for word. To this day, it remains a favorite in our house.Most, if not all, of the familiar voices have returned for this new motor-powered adventure. Tow Mater seems to take the lead this time, as he is inadvertently taken for an international spy and tossed right in the middle of a jalopy uprising. I was pleased to find Mater had more on-screen time, not just because he is a ""southerner"" like me, but also because he is just so darn lovable and funny!While this film is certainly not short on humor, it is also much more action-packed than its prequel. The spy cars, even Mater eventually, come fully loaded with automatic grappling hooks, machine guns, and missile launchers. While the plot of this story was undoubtedly all in great fun and entertainment, even my six-year-old commented on the bombs and guns. Perhaps it was a little more intense than what some people would prefer.The graphics were superb, of course. We did not see the 3D version of the film (I try to avoid these as much as I can!), but the colors popped and the story came to life before our eyes. The soundtrack is subtle, but fun, including a track from Weezer. The cast was spot-on. Michael Caine was the perfect choice for the British spy, Finn McMissle. I was sad that Doc Hudson was not included in this film (though he was honored near the beginning), but I later learned this was in respect to and in memory of the late Paul Newman. Other voice actors who were lost prior to the filming of Cars 2 include George Carlin (Fillmore) and Joe Ranft (Red), but these characters remain in the story.Overall, this film was fantastic, and I know it will join our home movie collection when it is released on DVD and Blu-ray.

"What 'Cars 2' does, it does well.","In this sequel to Cars, race cars Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) and his tow truck pal Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) head overseas to compete in the World Grand Prix race. Mater, however, gets sidetracked with international espionage. Helped by British spy cars, Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer), Mater must stop an unknown villain trying to sabotage the race, with Lightning McQueen as his possible target.I liked the first Cars, but I admit, amongst the other works of Pixar, it was my least favorite. With that said, I really enjoyed Cars 2. Yes, more so than Cars 1. It's very entertaining with both subtle and not-so-subtle humor that not everyone will quite get nor appreciate. The scenes in Tokyo are colorful and extreme. The scenes in Paris and Italy are breathtaking and beautifully rendered. This is a story about cars. There's only so many ways you can go with this subject. With that said, Pixar has again created a piece of work that remains consistent to their high quality.Admittedly, Lightning McQueen, the main character in the last film played by Owen Wilson, gets less of a role here compared to Mater, played by Larry the Cable Guy. I would guess some may have a big problem with this. To be frank, Larry the Cable Guy's brand of humor isn't to everyone's taste (nor mine), and perhaps represents what makes one feel embarrassed for being Americanespecially when in a foreign country. Well, that issue is exactly what comes up in this particular film. Mater is a constant embarrassment for Lightning McQueen whenever he is around—he is ignorant, unsophisticated, and often gets himself into bad situations. What Pixar does here, however, is not to simply leave Mater to just be the butt of every joke. In fact, the characters here actually learn somethingor at least we do. The theme in this film is about friendship and seeing value in people we normally would rather not associate ourselves with.The story is strong and twists are rather mind-boggling enough to keep little kids confused (but as an adult, I thought it was great!). Making Mater the main character, on a practical level, makes sense. Frankly, there are only so many more stories you can really squeeze out about Lightning McQueen at this point—everything already had been told in the last film. It's like a Rocky movie. Rocky sequels were okay, yes, but after a while, Rocky was no longer the underdog—now it's all about him keeping his title (it's like a story about a rich man staying rich)—there are not a whole lot of ways you can go with that plot (I suppose Rocky's next sequel could have him fight in spaceI know! Time machine! Brilliant!). One can say Cars 2 is like the further adventures of Rocky's Paulie, Mickey, or Adrian, from their point of view. I thought that was a good move. It's like how Empire Strikes Back was really Han Solo's film (although that is open for discussion).In the previous film, I didn't care much about Mater. I learned to like him in this film. A simple character has been made a little more complex. Lightning McQueen learns a valuable lesson about friendship, and Mater learns to self-reflect. Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy are fun as always as Mater and McQueen. Michael Caine is excellent as Finn McMissile, a super agent spy car, and Emily Mortimer does fine work as Holley Shiftwell.The overall feel of this film is more ""mature""-flavored without being overtly mature. This is true for much of Pixar's films in general. If you think about many classic Warner Bros. films, for example, they had many underlying mature themes. As for Pixar, they have explored, among others, themes related to mortality (Toy Story series), the family unit (The Incredibles) and fatherhood (Finding Nemo, Up). Cars do come in harm's way in this film. Some do explode. Nothing shocking here. They're cars. I dug the action scenes. This plays like a spy thriller, which admittedly, is more exciting than watching car races. Like much of Pixar's work, there is plenty of humor, a great helping of emotion, beautiful renders, and a clever story. I can't think of anything more to ask for than that. Now, did Cars really need a sequel? Perhaps not, but I enjoyed this one and it makes me even like the previous one.

First, it's a world of living cars. The first film was good as they fit the premise. The second doesn't as it follows spy-comedy and all. Action doesn't make a film good. Just remember that. It never did. And the plot, it the same plot in each and every spy film. But I can't say it's that horrible that it needs a Razzie. It actually deserves a mixed receptions as the good things are the action scenes and the background animation. But doesn't fit the problem alone. Owen Wilson, if you want Cars 4 to be a thriller genre, I have a story which has importance to the racing as well as the action.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Sorry, the movie didn't work","The original Cars movie was a great story wonderfully built up all the way to the end. There were several subtle themes along the way: Route 66, the old streets connecting the world, and about friendship, faith and courage.I never watched NASCAR, was never a racing fan, and even I know what ""pit stop"" means now.Cars 2, God only knows what it is. A spy caper? Why? And even if it was, at least it could have been built up to a crescendo.From Tokyo to Paris to Porta Corsa to London, and then on to Radiator Springs, the movie zips along at such a furious pace, without making the pieces glue together as a narrative. Even the moral, to be what you are, is as hollow as it can be.My son, a huge fan of the Cars movie, wanted to get out within an hour. He is OK with me buying him Cars 2 toys, the Finn McMissiles, but he doesn't want me to buy the DVD at all. That says it all.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just needs a minor tune-up,"I was really hoping that Cars 2 would score big like the first movie. The first movie is my favorite Pixar film, which maybe strange to some. It took in the lowest box office revenue out of all the films, and it is rated only a 74% on Rotten Tomatoes. Cars is true beauty in every category. Amazing colors, very heartfelt story, fifties nostalgia, amazing characters, and a soundtrack to die for.Even though considered a failure in Pixar's eyes, Cars still took in over $8 billion in merchandise. Being young when the first movie came out, I went to Target and bought all of the main characters from the first movie. The little side characters or the parody Toy Story characters weren't for me. I bought the main/supporting characters like McQueen, Mater, Ramone, Flo, Guido, Luigi, Sally, Fillmore, Sarge, etc. It was so much fun to get those little cars. You gotta collect them all! They had numerous race tracks which I didn't want, pillows, t-shirts, posters, and other merchandising options that two full isles at Target were Cars-out'd the whole summer of 2006. Because cars can be made into so many different things. Race tracks, different designs, colors, sizes, etc can be made from one outline. Lightening McQueen had at least eight other versions of himself. Mater had two if I can remember if you include the very light blue painting of him and his traditional, rusty colored truck. It was inane how many options there were.Now we have a sequel, to a film John Lasseter probably wanted to make since the death of his friend Joe Ranft, who helped co-direct the first film and voiced Red, the shy firetruck as well. His character makes an appearance, but remains sadly silent the whole film not uttering a single line or phrase. It's almost upsetting when you see his character.Lasseter made the Toy Story sequels because they were huge money-makers and more could be done with them. I hate to say it, but I think the original Cars could've survived on its own. This is in no way bad, but it is just average to Pixar's standards. Much of the fun from the original film isn't here. The tear-jerking Your Town tune is absent, the campy Radiator Springs fun is gone, the flashbacks to the fifties where towns were made up of close friends are all gone, and the nostalgia, besides the characters, none is here.Cars 2 doesn't fail entirely, though. Pixar manages to have some fun with the script and have very colorful moments about it. The end chase scene is very exciting, and I love how all the characters make it out without even a scratch. That part still impresses me. Try doing that with Grandpa's ol' 1972 Cadillac Eldorado.The plot focuses on Lightening McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) returning ""home"" to Radiator Springs every summer after the racing season to visit his friends. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) is still his tow-truck self, now working at a fancy car-themed restaurant where McQueen and his girlfriend Sally (Hunt) go to eat on McQueen's first night. Mater, who is watching TV while waiting for drinks to be served, notices that the ""sexy,"" Italian race-car Francesco Bernoulli (Turturro) is trash-talking McQueen. Mater, being the affectionate car he is, puts the motor where Bernoulli's mouth is and signs McQueen up to race against him in the Grand Prix.Mater then becomes involved in a very elaborate plan conducted by Finn McMissile (Caine), a secret agent race-car. I'd rather not spoil any details because I feel reading about the colorful excitement isn't half as fun as experiencing it on the big screen.Another problem I ran into that some characters didn't make an appearance, or weren't in it enough. Luigi and Guido, the two repairman of Radiator Springs, were hilarious in the first film but are in it far too little. Ramone and Flo, the husband and wife who run a body shop and diner, are barely in the film. Doc Hudson, voiced by the late Paul Newman, is dead according to Mater. And Fillmore's voice once provided by George Carlin is now voiced by Lloyd Sherr who does a just a stereotypical ""hey, man"" and ""spread the love"" motif the whole film.The lights are extravagant in Cars 2, especially in Tokyo. The billboards are beautiful and the scenery is truly amazing. CGI animated features are good if used to their full potential. Glossy productions don't always win people over. For me, it needs a good storyline. Cars 2 has a fairly decent one, but not one that sustains a film.The Toy Story themed short Hawaiian Vacation is actually very enticing and humorous, as all shorts from them are. I believe, this is the first Pixar short to utilize already familiar characters. Cars 2 doesn't fail at all, but it succeeds just because of its animation and well paced action. After eleven films and twenty five years of movie-making, Pixar has come to a sudden bump in the road. I'm sure this is just a minor fix, and they should be up and runnin' in a jiffy, but one can pray it doesn't go down the direction of Dreamworks or present day Disney. We may have to ship it to the junkyard.Voiced by: Owen Wilson, Larry the Cable Guy, Michael Caine, Emily Mortimer, Bonnie Hunt, Jason Isaacs, and Thomas Kretschmann.

Pixar's Edsel.,"It had to happen. Nobody's perfect, and they had to fail sometime.And it's not that it's a bad movie. Far from it. It's just that whenever I see Lasseter and Bird's names, the LAST thing I can think about is a mediocre movie. I'm one of the very few people (apparently enough) who LOVES Cars - so I really was waiting for its sequel.I should have known after watching Tron: Legacy. John Lasseter is losing his magic touch. If he was really involved on that movie's plot, then something happened to his movie-making talent. This, the next movie he's involved in, suffers from the same problems.I won't spoil the movie for you - you already know what it's all about, anyway. The story is far too complex for a kid (I was left scratching my head at the end about certain things). There are too many new characters to care about. The show is stolen by Mater, and not in a good way - he was funny in the first movie as a supporting character, but he's just not likable enough to carry the movie all by himself; I was expecting a Lightning McQueen movie, after all. When it all comes down to it, the plot is absolutely unremarkable - and that's quite a remarkable thing, considering this is Pixar we are talking about.I *suppose* this has to do with the Mouse House. Back when Pixar was an independent studio they could do anything they could ever want. Now they are part of a bigger company, and they seem to be following their directions. Why? Well, have you seen Disney's California Adventure? That park was a disgrace, and part of the things they are doing to fix it is creating - yep, you guessed it - Radiator Springs, which will be opened in 2012. I can imagine the pressure was on Pixar to create a sequel to a sort of unloved movie, and as much as Lasseter and Bird tried to create something like The Incredibles, they ended up with, yep, you guessed again, their brand new Edsel.Here's hope Pixar can do a comeback with their next film.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Really weird and not very good,"This film took a poor direction and tried to turn Cars into an action Bond type thriller, it was nice to see Michael Caine as new car Finn McMissile (groan) but the other new characters were either uninteresting or one dimensional. The biggest gripe I have with the film is the lack of good races and sidelining the main and best character Lightning McQueen in favour of spying side line, some of the action is quite good but it's just not memorable and is very bizarre, but not in a good way.4/10: I'm sorry to say but it's just not very good",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Such a masterpiece,"The plot is amazing. The action with Finn McMissile and the story driven mainly by Mater(or Martin in french)is soo differnt and puts some light on his life wich is seen as McQueen's bestfriend.Pixar makes such good films and this one raises the bar even higher and even though nowadays, we need racing films, before this film was perfect.It amazes me how this film can Blend in a bit of Fast&Furious and James Bond, While still keeping the film about racing.I also dont think it really suits the story of Cars 1 & 3 but it is like a parentesis wich puts us in an alternate universe for the time of 1 film.I also think that people being rude to this film can be fair since a while ago, A wise old man said ""Change is neither good or bad, it just is"" and I would add that it will become good if you start seeing it in a different way.But hey, enough philosophy, you should really think you should consider watching it or give it a second chance.And with that said, Smash that like button and drop that follow.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Building up the Cars lore while riffing on the spy genre.,"If anyone asks me for my unpopular movie opinion, they're likely going to hear that I think Cars 2 (2011) is the best entry in the Cars trilogy. While it still doesn't hold a candle to the superior works that Pixar released before it, Cars 2 took a risk by adapting the spy genre to its kid-friendly films. I was never much of a fan of NASCAR-style racing, so pushing these characters into worldwide Grand Prix races felt much more exciting to me. Still, I can see why some didn't like this pivot.As with most of the Cars movies, I never cared much for Mater (Larry the Cable Guy). The forced comedic relief always felt like it was based on how cringe-worthy they could make the character. Unfortunately, Mater had a much larger role in this movie, which only marginally worked because of how it felt like The Man Who Knew Too Little (1997). Despite this, there were a lot of new characters in this film that felt well-rounded and meant for the ""adult jokes"" the kids wouldn't quite get (for example, Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) being the car James Bond normally drives).Plot-wise, Cars 2 has a lot going for it. After only having raced in NASCAR races, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) had to contend with other racers who could easily outpace him, thus providing room for some character growth. Contrasted with all this, we have the ""spy"" plot that introduces the concept of lemons into the Cars universe. Expanding the idea of sentient cars outside the small town setting of Cars (2006) made the franchise feel more grounded in its extrapolation of the concept. After all, cars aren't exclusively an American thing, despite what our car-centric infrastructure might have you believe.Building up the Cars lore while riffing on the spy genre, I give Cars 2 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the best Pixar movies of all time.,"Why does Cars 2 receive so much hate? I think it's a movie masterpiece! Here's why:First of all, the graphics and landscape. This movie is beautiful and colorful! We see 4 countries across the northern hemisphere. We get to see Tokyo at night, a beautiful Italian city, and Paris and London at their best.Second, the soundtrack and score. None of the music in this movie is disappointing. We hear action and spy themed music, and calm yet enjoyable music. I would listen to the score any day of the week!Third, the racing. The racing is the main reason I watch this movie. It's incredibly realistic and colorful, and the car sounds are so cool! The racers themselves are all unique, with a Corvette, an Aston Martin, a rally car, GT and touring cars, LMP cars, and even a formula 1 car we'll get to later.Finally, this movie's pacing. None of the parts of this movie will make you fall asleep. The action makes up about 65% of the movie and is cool and fun to watch.Of course, all movies have their downsides.First, the main character. Mater is the leading character instead of lightning McQueen, and boy does he get annoying sometimes.Second, the movie's main moral. This movie teaches kids to be themselves no matter what other people think. This sounds good, but this movie shows Mater doing unacceptable and embarrassing behavior that I not okay, and he eventually learns that it's ""okay to do that"".Finally, the plot. I had to watch this movie about 5 times to fully understand it. The plot is very strange and doesn't make much sense.This is not good or bad: the characters. Almost all the characters have no issues, with Lightning McQueen's new racing rival, Francesco Bernoulli, being the absolute best of them all.Overall, this movie has a few flaws, but if you love racing, action, a little bit of comedy, then this movie is certainly the one for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
What a sequel to a great movie!,"I do not hate this movie, but Pixar sure created a weak one. The first Cars was enjoyable, while this was confusing and hard to follow. But at least its better than Wall.E, which is completely stupid and doesn't entertain. The main character is everyone's favorite tow truck, Mater. Mater is very annoying and not that funny, and they just don't focus enough on Mc-queen. But the trailer at least looked better than Planes (I haven't seen it, but I don't want to because it looks dumb and it gets a lot of hate.) I hope Cars 3 improves from this because if it doesn't, the franchise is dead. The story is an oil spill compared to the first because they had to ad spies. I think this is Pixar's second worst film.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Cars 2 - A Sequel That Might Just Be Better Than the Original,"Cars 2 will be released to DVD/Blu-ray November 2 and our youth film critics cannot say enough great things about it.

Race car Lightning McQueen and his best friend Mater travel to compete in the World Grand Prix. Cars 2 brings back our favorite car friends in this excellent adventure movie!My favorite characters are Lightning McQueen, Mater, and Finn McMissile. I like Lightning McQueen because he is really fast and he is really friendly. I like Mater because he is a really funny character and he doesn't always know what's going on. But even if he doesn't know what's going on he is always the best friend McQueen could ever have. I like Finn McMissle because he is a great spy car and he helps Mater to see who he really is. Mater realizes that he is perfect just the way he is.My favorite part of this movie is when Mater is being a spy and gets into a fire fight with the bad cars, but not on purpose! He says, ""Dag Gum,"" and then a gun pops out of his truck. Then he said, ""Oh shoot,"" and then the gun starts shooting! And then he said, ""Not that kind of shoot,"" and then a parachute popped out of his truck and he started to fly away. It was sooo funny!The animation and special effects in this movie are really cool. The bright lights and colors in the cars is amazing. The opening scene where Crabby is coming through the ocean is really cool. They had to use a lot of computer graphics in order to make the water actually look like it is waves. And of course the explosions are super cool.I would recommend this movie for ages three and up. This movie does have some violence but it isn't really scary or noticeable to younger kids. All in all, this is a great family movie that shows friendship and teamwork. Go out and buy this movie when it comes out on Disney DVD and Blu Ray.Credit: Anthony Aranda, age 9, KIDS FIRST!

Pixar's reputation doesn't deserve to be declining because of Cars 2's not being as creatively nourishing as before with the other movies,"You know, I had a feeling Pixar was going to have a backlash going against them someday and wasn't too surprised it was during the release of Cars 2, but I didn't think it would seem a 180 degree like I've assumed from many negative comments about this movie I've read here and other sites. Okay, in the interest of full disclosure, when I saw the trailer for this one and Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) made that joke about the pope-mobile and about having ""average intelligence"", I wasn't sure I wanted to see it. But now that I have, I'll now say that I highly enjoyed this almost as much as I've enjoyed the previous ones made by this highly creative company. Action scenes are great, there are plenty of humorous moments that are easily laughable mostly concerning Mater, and I liked the additions of Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) as British spies mistaking Mater for a fellow agent. And Owen Wilson as Lightning McQueen is still useful as a character despite not being on screen as much as in the previous Cars. So on that note, I highly recommend Cars 2 to anyone who's willing to not let Pixar's reputation bring them down simply because this one isn't as creatively nourishing as those previous others. P.S. I also had a nice laugh when Brent Musburger became the voice of Brent Mustangburger.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very odd film,"So apparently the original Cars was not exactly a critical success, but it was a real hit with the audiences, making mucho mucho moneez, as they say. So, a sequel was pretty much inevitable. Yay...Interestingly enough the sequel chooses to focus much more on Mater (Larry the Cable Guy). You know, Lightning McQueen's rusty tow truck sidekick from that little town in the first movie. Yeah, he's the main character in this. He teams up with a pair of British spy cars who are tracking an international terrorist group looking to discredit a new bio-fuel initiative.Yes, really.And I have to admit, I was not expecting that. None of us were. And in its bat guano insanity, I managed to find something. Is it a good film? Not really. There world still makes no sense, the Lightning McQueen side plot is perhaps needed, but ends up feeling rather pointless, and the humour is still only so-and-so. But I have to admit that when you have British James Bond cars zooming across the skies with jet engines and pulling mounted miniguns out of their fenders, you suddenly become much more accepting of the little oddities this world has. Like the fact that these cars need fuel to function, but they still eat human food. For some reason. Isn't fuel their food?And that's really the movie in a nutshell. It's Pixar's nice little break from the heavier stuff. It doesn't mean much, but you can have fun with it, and it's very much the definition of harmless. Personally I liked it even a bit better than the original, but then again that's not a high bar to cross.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A Good, Fresh Sequel,","Cars 2 is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and a fantastic voice cast. It's a very fresh sequel to Cars, completely different. I loved the spy movie theme, it was a very clever device to use in this universe and putting Mater at the centre of this adventure was the right choice. The universe expands itself far beyond what we see in the first film, and it is truly gorgeous to watch.It definitely has issues, it is missing heart, something that is very evident in the first Cars. It is there at times, but not nearly as powerful or heartwarming, it went for a comedic effect, which is fine, but for a Pixar movie I felt like it should have been much more sweet. As well as that, I think every character other than Mater is underused, McQueen is not in it nearly enough for the fact that he's suppose to be the main character of this series, and I definitely think Finn McMissile, superbly voiced by Michael Caine, could have had a much more prominent role, he is easily one of the best characters to come out of this franchise.The film expands the Cars universe immensely, which I think is the highlight, the first one really only takes place in two locations, but here we get to see them go all around the world. We see the Cars equivalent of Tokyo, France, England, it is all very impressive and the animators certainly did not hold back, it looks very beautiful.Simple family fun. It may be missing the heart that made the first Cars so great, but Cars 2 is a fun ride and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film.Lightning McQuenn takes on the World Grand Prix along with his pit crew and his best pal Mater, who is mistaken for a spy and gets caught up in his own adventure.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Retrospective Reviews- Cars 2 (2011),"Okay, here we go. We all know that out of ALL of the Pixar movies, 'Cars' wasn't the one screaming for a sequel. But if the dudes at Pixar REALLY believed this movie should have been done, they would have gone on with it and made a great movie that was as fun as their previous movies. And I'm glad they made it.PROS: I guess the best part of the film is that I didn't have high expectations for this movie to be the studios best, in fact, 'Toy Story 3' was their best but we all know they can't EVER make a movie that's as good as that. Once I saw the film, it wasn't too bad. It was funny, exciting, and had a good charm, feel and message, just be who you are, no matter what anybody else says. The animation was as good as ever, Pixar once again shows us why they're the animation kings. The look of the film was spectacular, with London, Tokyo, Italy and France looking brilliant. The atmosphere of all the locations drag you in so you feel like these are places you've been to before! (I've only been to London, but it's still great). The action sequences were extraordinary, my brother LOVES action films, and even though he had huge doubts about this film, I knew he'd watch it anyway because of all the explosions, guns and bombs and whatnot, with the new direction the franchise was taken in, it felt like a stand- alone movie, and not just a rehash of the characters and plot elements from the first one. Another good thing is that the film, unlike other Pixar films, doesn't take itself too seriously. Think about it, it's about SPY CARS! You wouldn't expect lots of teary- eyed feelings scenes like the original 'Cars' or the 'Toy Story' films! It's just a movie that you can switch your brain off to and watch. It's a popcorn movie.CONS: One of the few negative aspects of the film is the script, the story was a bit rusty and could have used a bit of Allinoil! Get it? Anyway, they could have tweaked the script a little bit, but the film still holds up. Lightning McQueen could have been used a lot more, we didn't really see many scenes of him and Mater together, so we couldn't really see how their friendship developed or how it deteriorated. But, other than those 2 things. The movie was another hit from Pixar. After 11 films of heart- warming stuff from them, it's about time the studio got rid of some of that touchy- feely stuff and just have some fun! And that's exactly what they've done here! Besides, all the critics and people who bashed this movie would have NEVER been able to put as much heart, soul and hard working story- telling into a film THEY make. This isn't a film for critics, OR a film for car lovers, it's for the people who don't like cars that much and LOVE movies. This is why, to me, it's more enjoyable that the first film.

Is this the worst Pixar film?,"""Cars 2"" (2011), after the release of ""Cars"" (2006), I figured that surely they wouldn't be dumb enough to do a sequel. ""Cars"", in my opinion, is Pixar's first dud. A weak movie, but still enjoyable though. Then, there came the announcement for ""Cars 2"". I just thought to myself: ""what?! This was the big demand? A sequel for 'Cars'? 'Cars'?! Why didn't they make 'The Incredibles 2'? Or, I don't know, any other film?"" But, since it was made by the one, and only Pixar Animation Studios, I decided to give it a fair chance and go see it in the theater. I did enjoy it somewhat the first time. However, the more I watched it, the more problems continued to emerge. ""Cars 2"" has devolved into, in my personal opinion, the worst Pixar movie I've seen so far! It has a convoluted story, standard to terrible voice acting and boring locations. The plot is, Lightning McQueen brings Mater with him on his racing tour around the world. Before the races begin, Mater ends up being mistaken for an American spy car and joins two secret agent cars to help them save the world from an evil car who intends on using lethal fuel to destroy other cars. Yeah, it's every bit as discombobulated is it sounds. There is way too much going on for one film, all the jokes fall flat and after the ""movie"" is over you just feel cold and empty. It's such an amazement that so much is going on during this ""film"", and I just don't give a crap. How is that possible? The story makes next to no sense. When, at any point, did the first movie have anything to do with espionage or spying? Now granted, they were on the right track with trying to make this ""film"" have it's own unique storyline in order to contrast with the first movie. Granted, some of the scenes, particularly a few of the action scenes, are well-done. But sadly, those scenes amount to nothing. Probably, the biggest issue is that they made Mater the main character, and he's supposed to be the comic relief. That's one of the most important rules of films and TV shows, never make the comic relief the main character! You need a foil to help balance everything out. What they should have done, was get Lightning McQueen to be roped into the secret agent business with Mater. Besides, the whole worldwide racing event is shoved to the side for this pointless spy adventure tie-in! Also, a lot of the lines just make me cringe when I hear them. The writing is nothing short of a joke in this ""movie"". It's unbelievable, a story of this caliber coming from the great Pixar Animation Studio! The plot for this ""film"" is so stupid, that it actually almost sounds like some other studio wrote the script and sent it to them. What a shame! Although, to be honest, I think the studio was more keen on selling toys than making a genuinely entertaining film. Earth to Disney and Pixar; you're both movie studios, not toy factories! As for the acting, it's overall just a total letdown from the whole cast. The only ones who seem to be trying, are: Owen Wilson, Emily Mortimer, Michael Caine and John Ratzenberger. Everyone else is just standard to horrible. But, the worst performance, by far, comes from Larry the Cable Guy as Mater. Keep in mind, I did enjoy Mater in the first movie. He got a few laughs out of me. As for this ""film"", he has hit rock bottom and has become the worst and most annoying character in the ""movie"". Isn't that sad? I think the reason why I liked him more in the first film, is because he had less screen-time. Therefore, his humor had a stronger impact. In the case of his character, less is more. When Mater is the main character, he is just beyond obnoxious! Some of the locations in the ""movie"" are a bit dull. But, there are a lot of them that are decent. Now, let's get into the only two positive elements in this pile of filth. The animation in this ""film"" is fantastic, which is a given for Pixar Animation Studios. All of their movies are very well animated, and this one is definitely no exception. Finally, the soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is excellent. Most of the film scores he writes and composes are great, and this one is no different. Although, I think the music is trying harder than everything else! ""Cars 2"" is a major disappointment in the world of CGI animated films. This is easily, in my opinion, the worst Pixar movie I've seen (so far). But, it does have some redemption though. If this is the worst a studio can produce, then you know that you have an outstanding animation studio! I'm giving this ""movie"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Do I have to tell you to avoid ""Cars 2""? Just watch any other Pixar film except for this one. Otherwise, you might just find yourself being towed away by Mater the tow truck!",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

"If you liked Cars, you will enjoy Cars 2","I'm 34 years old and I went to see the movie with my 2 nephews (10 and 5 years old) without knowing anything about the storyline.I went to the theater after reading some bad reviews (and some good), probably my expectation lowered a bit but I can't believe how people can give vote below 6 (for me it is an 8): Did they expected a completely new Fable with teardrops at the end ? Are they disappointed by their own expectation because they think that every new movie must be more spectacular than the one before ? Have they watched too much trailers ?I enjoyed everything of Cars 2. My nephews too.

"Critics criticized, but for the wrong reasons.",". It's not often that I get to see a movie on opening weekend, so I thought I would write something about it, since many of the critics on Rotten Tomatoes seem to just not get it. Some say the plot was hard to follow, it was not. Some were Southern-phobics, who had problems with Mater, I do not. Some said that they did not like the first ""Cars"", and that just rips away any credibility that they might have had with me.The original ""Cars"" was awesome. It was a parody of ourselves using something we love the most--cars. The story was basically the same as the old Michael J. Fox flick ""Doc Hollywood"", but the jokes, the music and the artful animation still made it a great movie. Unfortunately, ""Cars 2"" , in comparison, only has the artful animation.Most Pixar flicks have some movie or genre of movies in which they take their underlying style. For example, ""A Bug's Life"" uses ""The Magnificent Seven"", ""Up"" uses ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", and ""The Incredibles"" take a A LOT from the Sean Connery James Bond movies. Unfortunately, they must not have gotten enough out of James Bond, because they resort much of this with ""Cars 2"", and the attempt is far less subtle and creative. This also contradicts all the effort made to relate personally to the cars in the previous film.Imagine if a movie like ""Cowboy vs. Aliens"" was the sequel to ""Dances With Wolves"". It just wouldn't work. ""Cars"" parodied much of everyday life and ""Cars 2"" just turned it all into an action movie and the filmmakers should have known better! It also seems that the effort was not all there for this one either. ""Cars"" had some great gags and visuals placed during musical numbers throughout the film. ""Cars 2"" only had one of these numbers and it was pretty lame. It was song originally performed by the Cars and it wasn't even sung by them. There was very little to laugh at.The story in itself was not too bad, but the moral in it was the weakest that Pixar has presented and still was not that different from ""The Incredibles"".There was also fairly obvious scenes that were in there to boost toy sales. The product placement for State Farm was atrocious. Since when does the might Pixar have to rely on product placement? Pitiful! Finally, it's rated G, but IMO, it should really be PG. Yeah, the violence is just cars against cars, but cars are personified and killing them by blowing them up or hitting them with a death ray can still be intense..",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

As Brilliant as Pixar Gets,"I came into this film worried because of the many negative reviews for it, but I have to say that by the end of it, I didn't know what they were talking about. Cars 2 is as good a film that belongs in the Pixar norm. I laughed, I was excited, and I cared for Mater throughout the film. All in all, it was fantastic. It reminded me of Speed Racer, Thunderbirds, and most noticeably James Bond. It was a great concept to combine all of these films and show it from the Cars' point of view.Mater is charming to watch and all of the comedy read well with me. So, for all of us regular movie goers who get excited every time a new Pixar film comes out, be relieved that this film is great and the kids will absolutely love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Back when Disney/Pixar drove off the road...,"The Disney/Pixar library has grown extensively since the debut of 'Toy Story' back in 1995. In 2011, we saw a follow up to one of the studios' least popular entries - 'Cars.' The sequel that no one asked for was, as expected, not good.The problem with 'Cars 2' is similar to the problem with the original - talking cars are just not as compelling as fish, toys or even monsters. It's like, ""so what, who cares?"" Even with the voice talents of Owen Wilson, Michael Caine and Bonnie Hunt, it's not enough to make up for the overdone plot and the constant grating of Larry the Cable Guy's voice (why was Mater in almost every scene in this movie?).Sure, there's a nice message in here about being yourself, etc., but the wrapper that this principle is stuffed in is just not appealing whatsoever.'Cars 2' is perhaps one of the biggest clunkers from these animation studios' catalogue, which makes the fact that it yielded a three-quel very perplexing.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
A sequel that really isn't.,"One of the best movie reviews ever written came from the pen of Roger Ebert while talking about the movie ""2010."" In short, Ebert wrote that as good as 2010 might be, people's memory of the original film -- ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" -- would so forever cloud their judgment that ""2010"" could never be given a fair shake.Given that the original ""Cars"" is, to some, Pixar's best work, and certainly no worse than a solid effort, the sequel is going to have difficulty gaining traction. And like many, I was perplexed as to what exactly there was left to do with this story arc.Whereas the first movie is an ode to pre-Interstate America and gives a slap to the anti-car joykillers among us, this movie is not similar in any way save for the characters it uses to tell the story. The original ""Cars"" is a needed lesson for not throwing away or being dismissive of our past; ""Cars 2"" is James-Bond-meets-Cannonball-Run.Fans of the spirit of the first movie, therefore, will have to find a way to detach before they can enjoy it. The supporting cast of the first film is essentially MIA. The supporting cast of the new film doesn't engender the same level of concern or interest. This is basically a two-man show, Mater and McQueen, and fortunately enough the writing is good enough to float the ship.Where this movie stands out is in its presentation, graphics, pacing and look. It is just as fast as the original movie is slow. And it has several thunderously funny moments thanks to a clever script and a brief glimpse into the life of owning British automobiles.Not Pixar's best by any stretch, but still light years better than what other animation studios are coming up with.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Cars 2"" will be remembered as Pixar's first stumbling failure","The first Cars (2006), in addition to being one of Pixar's only productions not to win an Oscar, is also one of the lowest grossing. One of the problems pointed out was the fact that it was very typically American. To make it universal, what solution is taken? Insert the characters in a broader context, and as the most global automotive event that exists is Formula 1, there they went! And while the protagonist and star Lightning McQueen is the highlight of the tracks, he will be his best friend, Mate who will be responsible for all the confusions and disasters, involving them in an international conspiracy that could take them to great dangers.Written by Ben Queen from a document designed by Lasseter, Brad Lewis and Dan Fogelman, the script for Cars 2 is right by investing in a story different from the one seen in the original instead of making the same mistake as most sequels and trying to repeat the formula previous - and it is a pity, therefore, that the plot chosen by the team is so bad and equally formulaic. Adopting the ""espionage"" genre as the basis of the narrative, the film brings Lightning McQueen (Wilson) and his best friend Mate (Larry the Cable Guy) on a journey around the world while the race car participates in a series of disputes promoted to prove the efficiency of an alternative, clean and renewable fuel. However, Mate ends up being mistaken for an American spy and starts to head several adventures with the agent Finn (Caine) and his assistant Holley (Mortimer) while trying to discover the identity of the villain who seeks to sabotage the races to discredit the new fuel.The change in the focus of this new film in relation to its predecessor is precisely its biggest mistake. The first ""Cars"" was a love letter from Lasseter to the old American roads, telling a story of rediscovery and nostalgia through the eyes of the arrogant race car Lightning McQueen, which found its way around the world in a small town on the edge of the legendary Rota 66, building an unlikely friendship with the rusty and naive squeak Mate. This second tape, on the other hand, places Mate as the unlikely hero of a plot involving international espionage, while McQueen embarks on a competition around the world, promoted by an alternative fuels tycoon. Pixar's previous films used fantastic premises to convey relatively complex messages to the audience while amusing and impressing them, but here that ambition is left completely aside in the name of ""fun"".The impression is that the direction of John Lasseter and, mainly, the script of Ben Queen made little effort to fix the mistakes of the previous film, promoting little changes. And even some of them don't work, being crucial to the disappointing end result. The promotion of Mate as the protagonist is the main one and has two immediate effects: it eliminates the chance of a dramatic arc that anchors the narrative and forces the script to try to conceive at least twice as many jokes involving the tow truck, diluting the gags that, most of the time, they sound predictable and uninspired. In the same way, the attempt to create a conflict through the misunderstanding between Lightning and Mate appears silly and cliché, forcing the viewer to hear the kind of artificial and foolish dialogue that normally did not find space in Pixar's works (""Why would you ask for Kill not to be himself? ""Says someone at a certain moment, stopping to complete it with a"" Believe in your heart! ""Or a"" Follow your dreams! "").The desperation of Cars 2 to establish some kind of solidity in its plot, in fact, reaches its peak the instant Mate, without apparent reason, lets out an unbelievable ""I already know what has to be done!"" only to conclude that he will not be able to ""do it"" because he does not feel secure in himself, forcing his old friend to encourage him - and this type of regrettable Manichaeism is spread throughout the work, beginning on the scene, even at the beginning of the film, in which Lightning mourns the death of Doc Hudson in a monologue accompanied by an artificial trail just to forget the subject in the very second he leaves the museum dedicated to the old mentor (apparently, Pixar decided to exclude the character after the death of his voice actor, Paul Newman, although the hippie van originally voiced by George Carlin did not deserve the same consideration).Thus, it becomes at least strange to see McQueen leverage for Mate to shine with his jokes and accent. However, everything would be eased if the story remained in American territory, mainly in Radiator Springs, betting on simplicity. The script, however, not only decides that the tow truck travels the world, but also makes it a spy, even if it gets in the way. That's right, ""Cars 2"" is a spy movie, with super technologies, the most diverse disguises and a villain that will only be revealed in the last moments of projection. The worst thing is that not even the police plot proves to be attractive and well-designed. Wanting to promote shallow reflections on the misuse of fuels (for a short time, in a single sentence, to contradict oneself completely), the screenwriter delivers persecutions, tortures and sabotages that surround a mystery that never proves intriguing. In fact, the only answer that the childlike script prefers to hide from the viewer is exactly the identity of the true leader of the evil band, someone already identifiable in the second act of the film. Choosing a fake camera as their main weapon also doesn't help, as well as creating ""incredible"" technological antics to free the good guys. But the worst thing is to realize that even the basic plot conceived by Lasseter and his collaborators does not make the least sense, since the revelation of the villain implies a series of absurd holes in his plans and motivations.In this regard, there are no limits for ""Cars 2"". If you think that automobiles cannot swim or fly, you are extremely wrong. At least in the universe invented by John Lasseter, all of this can happen, in a way that even James Bond would be a bit jealous. Therefore, it becomes disheartening to see Mate and company get away from the enemy siege in the blink of an eye, dispensing with intelligence and putting technical resources in evidence. Also wasting the opportunity to dive into the logic behind the hierarchy of this curious universe, Cars 2 brings cars inside cars and inside airplanes and boats, in a dominance window that could yield good jokes and discussions, but that is never investigated or explored by the script.Lazy in the development of his characters and cliché in the elaboration of his plot, the film proves Lasseter's lack of momentary inspiration even in what would normally be one of the most imaginative sequences of the project: Mate's dream / hallucination, which ends up being limited to to present itself as a series of flashbacks from different points of view and which, in addition to adding nothing to the narrative, still misses the chance to dive into the typical visual invention of the studio. On the other hand, the production design of the film is fantastic as usual: from the rocks that lead to cars to the urban, illuminated and multicolored chaos of Tokyo (with its tiny sleeping spaces), Cars 2 is an aesthetic show dominated by shiny surfaces and attractive that live up to a technological universe dominated by machines, finding time for (some) more inspired gags, such as casino dice that appear like those tacky car ornaments. Similarly, the design of the characters is intelligent and organic, taking advantage of the vehicles' natural shapes as indicative of their personalities - and observe, for example, how the rear view mirror of one of the villains becomes a suggestive monocle or how many of the Japanese cars bring attributes typical of anime.Reaching their best moments in the races starring Lightning, when Lasseter and his team simulate condensation on the track and pieces of sand hitting the cameras, Cars 2 also surprises in the action sequences involving the espionage plot and which turn out to be much more violent than the expected - and it is curious to see how the filmmaker extends in a long plane that accompanies the fall of a vehicle from a great height until the moment when it shatters at sea, in an unexpected sadism on the part of the film. In addition, it is at least inelegant that the director pays homage to himself by obviously focusing on a tire brand called ""Lassetyre"" - and embraces it with fun Ratatouille is fun (with the ""Gusteau's"" restaurant becoming ""Gastow"" in Paris here view), ends up only disappointing when repeated by the film, since Pixar is not usually so obvious in its internal jokes.Even featuring an unimaginative soundtrack by the generally great Michael Giacchino, ""Cars 2"" will be remembered as Pixar's first stumbling failure. As if that were not enough, the film is still in charge of sending very positive messages to its young audience, planting the idea that the ""junkies"" (the ""old"", ""different"", ""rejected"") see the world with envy, resentment and bad intentions. And what about his supposed ecological message, which at first seems to advocate the importance of a clean and sustainable fuel just to conclude with the incredible mantra ""once gasoline, always gasoline""? It is sad not to be able to finish a text about a film from this studio with a ""recommended"", but you can't always get it right.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

I guess some critics take their title a bit too literally.When I first heard they were making Cars 2, I though - oh no, there's nothing left to do, Cars was complete in itself. But then I found out it would be an action/spy thriller and thought - excellent! There's no more character development to advance, so why not make it a full on fun action thriller? And it is.No, there's not a lot of character development, but how many people know the back-story of Miss Moneypenny or M in a James Bond film? This movie isn't about that. It's about sending Mater out into the world and giving him an adventure. If you like the characters from Cars, then you will like it, and your kids will like it.

Cars 2,"Cars 2 just opened in theatres and you can probably guess what my four year old son wanted to do this morning.Well to be honest he has wanted to do it ever since I was stupid enough to play the trailer for him. Never play a trailer for a small child they don't get the concept of 'its a trailer' and you will regret it for the rest of the night. So after that fiasco I was finally able to take my son to see it and I and he can report back with our feedback.I am including his comments in my review because to be fair who cares what a 30 year old male thinks when the demographic is clearly small children 8 years and under.Lets start with the premise for those who may have not been following the sequel; Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson)and Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) take their friendship to new places when they head overseas to compete in the first-ever World Grand Prix to determine the world's fastest car. But the road to the championship is filled with plenty of potholes, detours and hilarious surprises when Mater gets caught up in an intriguing adventure of his own: international espionage.Torn between assisting Lightning McQueen in the high-profile race and towing the line in a top-secret spy mission, Mater's action-packed journey leads him on an explosive chase through the streets of Japan and Europe, trailed by his friends and watched by the whole world. Adding to the fast-paced fun is a colorful new all-car cast that includes secret agents, menacing villains and international racing competitors.I have to start by saying I never saw the original Cars movie because for whatever reason as much as I am a huge Pixar fan the premise fell flat with me. Talking cars? No thanks. That said my son loved the first film and has all the toys, the stickers, and even has his room wallpapered with Cars characters. So to say I was really excited to take him to see the sequel was an understatement despite the fact my interest level was just above zero at best. Unfortunately Cars 2 is exactly what I feared it would be and maybe a little bit worse.Cars 2 offers some top notch animation, big name voice over's and even include some interesting cameos like that of Sig Hansen Captain of the Northwestern from the show Deadliest Catch on Discovery Channel. It has a few laughs, it has some action but it also has a good 45-60minutes of drawn out character interactions that made my little guy drift off from why we were there and at about the half way mark of the movie he was ready to get up and make a ruckus.Cars 2 comes off to me as an unneeded sequel and although it had its laughs and some high points and when I asked my son what he thought he said 'it was good daddy' and when I asked him 'would you like to see another cars movie?' he replied 'lets watch something else'. He may have seen the first film easily 20 times but its safe to say that neither myself nor my 4 year old are interested in seeing it twice. Cars 2 was boring, drawn out and offered very little entertainment for me as an adult and very limited entertainment value for my 4 year old.It cost us $40 when you include the popcorn and drinks and frankly I think I would have been further ahead to rent one of the Top 10 Pixar Movies on Luke's new top list for $3.99 then go see Cars 2. My advice is skip it and watch it on DVD. My kid is a huge huge CARS fan and knows every character and he was extremely distracted and bored and made it clear after he had fun but is in no rush to see it or anymore cars movies again. I can honestly say the highlight was the 8 minute long Toy Story short film at the start of the movie which was both funny, charming and entertaining. Everything Cars 2 was not.

Cars 1 was their least ambitious film.,"Cars 1 was their least ambitious film. The story was predictable and character development obvious making it their most mediocre film. It was good but it lacked that little extra touch that made their films great. However, they had some great side characters, a heart, and wonderful scenes that elevated it up beyond most other films. But ever since this film's announcement I always wondered why. McQueen had his story and there's not much else to tell. Like Finding Nemo, where else is there to go? And I'd rather see sequels to better movies like The Incredibles, even Bug's Life seems to have more potential. It's easy to see why they made a sequel to it, since all you need to do is go to Disneyland or any Disney Store and see it covered in McQueen and Mater, which happened to be two my of three year-old cousin's first words. Off all the Pixar films, Cars made the most with the merchandise.The biggest problem is the story. Cars 1, while predictable, was touching. Cars 2 has almost no heart or character development. The focus shifts from McQueen to Mater. McQueen had his story in the first and there's little to tell here. He has one character moment that's essentially the same realization as the first film's. The problem with Mater is that he's such a simple character. Everything about him is on the surface for all to see. He's the same person throughout the movie, with one predictable realization which goes no where, that he doesn't warrant his own film. He's like Kronk from The Emperor's New Groove. They're both terrific side characters but lack enough complexity for a full story. And Larry the Cable Guy has always been better with the other Blue Collar guys rather than on his own.",,Anonymous,Animation

Keep Your Engines Reving.,"An international Grand Prix circuit in exotic world locations acts as the setting for this impressive sequel to the original smash hit of 2006.

Also along for the ride, and basically stealing the show, is best friend Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) who unwittingly gets mixed up with a British super-agent (Michael Caine ala an automobile version of James Bond's 007).

"""Cars 2 "" is a good ride for families","If you're looking for another Pixar masterpiece, you'll won't find it here. But if you are looking for a good time at a family movie this summer, Pixar's ""Cars 2"" is just the ride, no matter which version you see it in {3-D and 2-D}.In this sequel to the hit 2006 film, Mater mistakenly becomes a secret spy, while his friend Lighting Mcqueen rides in the World Grand Prix. Mater uncovers a plan to stop Allinol gasoline.Most of the voice cast is back, with some brand new characters. Owen Wlison is good but a little underused as Lighting. Michael Caine and Emily Mortimer are both clever and smart respectively as two new characters,Finn McMissile and Holley Shiftwell. John Turturro is very funny as Lighting's newest rival, Francesco Bernoulli. But the movie's real star is Larry the Cable Guy as Mater. He steals the picture from start to finish.John Lasseter is back in the director's chair and he gives the picture its magical, cool and dazzling vision. Ben Queen's script is smart and outrageous. Michael Giacchino's hot score helps gives the film its magic touch.This movie is hip and cool as it gets. Together with a brand new remarkable short featuring the gang from ""Toy Story 3"", it makes it a perfect time at the movies for the whole family.My pick: Green light {See It}",,Anonymous,Animation
Cars 2 is not vintage Pixar but it's fun!,"Since the release of the first fully computer animated feature film Toy Story (1995), Pixar Animation Studios have enjoyed a string of successes with their films. Critics adore them, adults and children are stunned by them. But 2006′s Cars was the first movie to split opinions. It was certainly the weakest Pixar entry. Five years later, the public has been invited back into the driving seat for the sequel which again has divided the masses.Cars 2 is not vintage Pixar, it lacks the intimacy of Up (2009), the intrigue of Wall.E (2008) and the nostalgic joy of the Toy Story franchise (1995 – 2010). It is not a perfect film by any sense of the word and joins its predecessor in the weaker section of the studio's filmography. However, Cars 2 is still thrilling and visually extravagant, surpassing the majority of its animated rivals.After being challenged by Italian Formula 1 car Francesco Bernoulli (voiced by John Turturro), Piston Cup winner Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) teams up with 'Tow' Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) and heads off to the World Grand Prix: the ultimate race that takes place in Japan, Italy and London. However, behind the scenes is a spy ring headed by British secret agent Finn McMissile (voiced by Sir Michael Caine) and his new partner Holley Shiftwell (voiced by Emily Mortimer). Some confusion later leads to Mater being mistaken for a spy and he has to join forces with McMissile to stop a deadly threat to the car world.The main problem with Pixar's sequel is that it seems to slightly forget what the studio preaches oh–so–often. Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter is famous for believing that computer animation is only a tool to make these movies; characters and narrative drive the picture. But the characterisation in this movie is sadly below par. The majority of Radiator Springs' natives are completely forgotten and bizarrely, Mater has the majority of the screen time, making him the lead and McQueen the supporting act.It is certainly not all bad. The last few DreamWorks entries have gone toe-to-toe with the Luxo Lamps, but Cars 2 makes sure they lead the pack once again. The visuals are phenomenal, particularly in the race sequences: the Tokyo footage is beautiful with its glowing neons soaking the night's sky and the impressive reflections on the racers' bodywork.Then, there's the action: the film's opening is literally explosive, the espionage storyline brings insanely cool gadgets bursting to life in all the mania while the chase sequences look and feel fast-paced. One particular chase through the tightly-wound Italian streets is certainly amongst the film's high points.The voicing is universally very good. Wilson is great as McQueen and does exactly what he does in the first picture, he's just not as cocky. Caine is great as McMissile and is easily the best character in the film: his gadgets are cool, his action scenes are cool and he, himself, is undeniably cool. Mortimer is also a strong casting choice as Shiftwell as is Turturro as the cheesy and over-confident Francesco.If you are looking for a family film to see now the children have finished school, Cars 2 is a great choice and offers plenty for all to enjoy. If you are expecting another Toy Story 3 or an inner-child exercise, you might be a little disappointed.Verdict: ●●● Although 'Cars 2′ doesn't offer the sheer wonder of other Pixar features, it's still a very solid, entertaining and visually impeccable feature that's well worth your time.Read more reviews on www.theupcoming.co.uk",,Anonymous,Animation
Sequel can't match original,"My son has seen ""Cars"" perhaps 50 times or more, so when ""Cars 2"" appeared in Seoul in 3D yesterday, we went.A sequel is made to capitalize on a great success. Here, with five years to deliver and an estimated $200 million and the opportunity to use 3D, the film fell short.The 3-D is poor. During the promotional material before the show, LG showed what 3-D should look like -- feathers floating so close you feel you can reach them, a jet flying out of the screen. The Disney-version is 2D tricked out with 3D glasses. We could have saved about half the ticket price by seeing it in 2D.The story is extremely weak. It begins like a repackaging of the standard spy film with all the usual gimmicks, then pastes in ""alternative energy"" and car racing for extra action. Seeing this, and watching American TV (medical shows, crime shows, and medical-crime shows) it appears that corporate media bureaucrats can no longer find creative talent. If you want action without a sensible story, it does have action.The real weakness, however, is that what made the original great is gone. It was the brilliant characterization, the variety and the depth, that made ""Cars"" a film you could watch again and again (as adults are sometimes forced to). Here, the wonderful characters are just cameos -- they appear, speak a few lines to remind you of the original film, and they are gone.Even McQueen has a relatively minor role.I'd give it a ""6"" -- it is still a watchable work of art, and the graphics are spectacular (despite the total failure as 3-D). Better management would have demanded a better story and something that stretched the 3-D technology to its limits.",,Anonymous,Animation
I'm so sad,"I'm the hugest fan of Pixar and here i'm so sad.The differences that i think make this movie much worst than the first are:Cars and Cars2 is that in Cars, cars do what they really do in real life, and people just disappear. In Cars 2 cars do what PEOPLE do, jump around, use weapons, drink, go to bathroom, use elevators... etc etc etc. Makes you think they are not cars, but people turned to cars. There are even Geisha-style cars. That's definitely not Pixar style. Makes me think of other companies.Cars2 is action non-stop, you can't get used to a place anymore, the scenarios are a lot and the characters, a lot. Just very boring, the action bores you at the end.I'm so sorry. I understand why they could have done this, but please, don't do more sequels. Please.",,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointing,After how much I loved the first one and waited for 3 years to see this I was disappointed,,Anonymous,Animation
Better than the original but inherits many of it's flaws,"Pixar has an almost exemplary record, so when the original ""Cars"" appeared, it somewhat blemished the almost perfect critical record the company had enjoyed to that point.Pixar would not have been fazed, $5 Billion sales of toys related to the film dwarfed any Box Office return and even those were healthy enough. ""Cars 2"" aims to correct the previous mistake of a thin plot and a dubious central premise.The computer animated film starts well enough, with a well paced and exciting Bond pastiche, following a British Aston Martin secret agent Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) infiltrating and escaping from a villains lair, aboard multiple offshore oil platforms.We then return to Radiator Springs, home of Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) and his BCF (Best Car Friend) Mater, the rusty pick up truck (Larry The Cable Guy). McQueen has become a successful racer, winning the piston cup, now renamed the Hudson trophy (in honour of the late Paul Newman's character in the previous film) but is taking some downtime in his home time with his Porsche girlfriend Sally (Hunt).Mater is acting in a manner that would get him slapped with a restraining order in real life but in cartoon land, just wants to spend more time with his best pal. Responding to a TV phone in boast, Mater enters McQueen in the ""World Grand Prix"", a race organized by Sir Alexelrod (Izzard) to promote his new alternative fuel ""Allinol"".This provides an excellent excuse to travel the globe, Italy, Japan and England for races between McQueen and his arch rival, the Italian Formula1 car, Bernoulli (Tuturro). F1 is never mentioned, perhaps due to contractual reasons, Bernie Ecclestone presumably not buying into the whole talking cars approach.The whole local support team are brought back onto the pit crew to assist McQueen on his quest and somewhat reluctantly, Mater is allowed along for the ride.Mater quickly messes everything up and inadvertently gets mixed up in International espionage with Finn and Holly Shiftwell (Mortimer), as they attempt to uncover a dastardly plot headed by Professor Zendepp (Kretschsmann). The professor, rather bizarrely, is in charge of an army or fleet of ""Lemons"", cars that were inherently a bit rubbish. Cue the first torture scene in a Pixar film, admittedly off screen, as information is extracted from the unfortunate Rod Torque Redline.Various adventures and action sequences follow, crude stereotypes are employed, the Queen in England, Mafia types in Italy, does the main villain really have to be a German with a monocle, really, on a car? The film ends with a lengthy explanation of who did what and why, emulating the end of a ""Scooby Doo"" episode. This has never been necessary in a Pixar film before, normally what/why is covered subtly within the film, lengthy exposition has never been necessary, see the start of ""Up"" for how much can be conveyed in a short time.As ever, the animation and sound are faultless, the race scenes are more exciting than a F1 race, sound and picture in perfect harmony and the set pieces are fun, exciting and imaginative.With bright colours and talking cars, younger children will enjoy the film, just as they did the original ""Cars"".Adults however, may be very disappointed. Not a word usually used in the same sentence as ""Pixar"". The idea that cars can talk with their mouths animated and wheels acting as hands, in many ways just does not work. Arguably, too many liberties have to be taken to provide the cars with human characteristics and then you wonder, what's the point? There are many segments in the film where the story is just, well, boring and yet this is normally a Pixar strong point. Eddie Izzard is a flamboyant comedian and yet here, is allowed to just read his lines with hardly any inflection, something he would likely have resisted given the opportunity.Wilson is bland, Mortimer a bit more lively but the voice cast is only really saved by a sterling performance by Caine, audiences will recognize his voice anywhere.Directed by the vastly experienced John Lasseter the head honcho at Pixar, this appears to be more an exercise in getting as many characters on screen, in as many different territories as possible to sell as many toys as possible. Whilst this may have been the net result of other Pixar films, you never felt it was their sole intention. Here it does feel like an extended Toy commercial in parts, sell the toys and wrap a film around that premise, rather than a great film that happened to spawn a line of toys.Lets hope this is not Disney's pervading marketing influence affecting the company, as the partnership evolves. Certainly we expect better when ""Brave"", the new Pixar film hits our screens next yearSummaryFun for young kids but audiences who have left Primary school behind, may find little to interest them here, despite the excellent animation and action.Better than the original but inherits many of it's flaws and represents a further minor disappointment from a studio that has always promised and delivered so much more.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/",,Anonymous,Animation
It's not really Pixar anymore,"Cars 2 looks amazing. The sets are just breathtaking, with views from Japan, Italy and England. The animators had fun adding little details that mirror the world of Cars in real places of the world; for example, instead of Big Ben, you have Big Bentley. Clever.Lots of action, races, gadgets, etc. But..... where is the heart? Pixar has always treated us to stories that placed the characters and the relationships at the centre of the story, without compromising on the action and the humour. Here, the concept is interesting - spy cars, with all the gadgets you can imagine, and races around the world - but it's more a pretext than a real story.I remember reading somewhere, back in the good old days of independent Pixar, that they were never going to make sequels just for the sake of sequels. Toys Story 2 and 3 were excellent sequels, with enough meat to be real movies in themselves, so in this way, we can't consider them just mere ""sequels"". Cars 2, on the contrary, feels exactly like the kind of sequel that you make when you have great characters that are going to sell a lot of movie-related stuff - toy cars, lunch bags, pj's for little boys and all that crap. The characters are half developed, a lot more caricatured than what Pixar has ever used us to. The heart of the story - which would be Mater feeling like he is not accepted the way he is I guess - is very superficially treated; in the end, we never really cared.All that being said, it's still better than a whole lot of stupid animated movies that movie studios churn out every year. But it's not Pixar anymore.I felt sad as I walked out; Pixar is finally bowing down to almighty Disney.",,Anonymous,Animation
Okay sequel to one of the weakest Pixar originals,"‎'Cars 2' was alright. An okay sequel to probably one of the weakest Pixar films. If you're not a fan of Larry the Cable Guy's ""Mater"", then you won't enjoy it. It's basically his film, not Lightning McQueen's. Also missed the voices of the late Paul Newman and George Carlin this time around. A good film, but strictly for the little ones (went with a free ticket, btw).The one thing I was very impressed with, from an animation standpoint, was the incredibly realistic outdoor daytime shots. From the picturesque desert skies of Radiator Springs to the overcast skies of London, I found myself doing a double-take at how realistic it all looked, right down to the buildings and cobblestone roads in the foreground.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"Cars 2Great, now that cars can talk, we're going to need to draft up another distracted driver bylaw.Wait a minute!

Unfortunately, it's Mater, who inadvertently becomes embroiled with two spies (Michael Caine, Emily Mortimer) trying to thwart a power move by history's worst selling cars.When it comes to the animation, all of the Pixar earmarks are present.

Better than the first one,"Great sequel to a great movie! Cars 2 might have been trashed by the critics and most people, but this movie does not deserve that treatment.It is an action packed fast paced entertainer, about Mater- Lightning's best friend- going to Tokyo to see his friend race, and getting mixed up in a spy action, and how this affects Lightning's all important race. Why are there problems in the race? What does Mater do with the spies?, are the questions which will be answered if you watch the film.The movie moves at a jet's speed from scene 1 to the last scene. It is guaranteed that there will be no scenes which will bore you. The idea of mixing up spies, cars and racing in one movie is appreciable, and I thought it has been done intelligently with logic.The movie's biggest plus however is the extraordinary visuals and details put into each scenes, which of course is the thing Pixar is famous for. The animation has been spot on.I agree that it does not go much into the character's feelings which people would have expected from Pixar, but I don't think Pixar meant to make this movie emotional but full of action and entertainment, and in that point of view, Pixar has succeeded in that. But there are some emotional scenes about friendship too (but only few for those seeking emotion in Pixar film)There are however some issues as the spy theme seems to be a bit complicated to younger audience, which is where the bad reviews come from.But overall it is a great movie for the summer, but by far better than Cars 1!!!

It was Inevitable.. The first poor Pixar movie...,"Pixar has never succumbed to cash-in sequels; sure, we had both Toy Storys' 1 + 2, but there was another chapter to their story that had to be told. However, I always doubted a sequel to Cars could improve on its predecessor as it had reached a natural conclusion- I rated Cars higher than other reviewers as I liked its fish-out-of-water, homely Pixar-like feel. It didn't need a sequel..And it certainly didn't deserve this.Cars 2 bears no resemblance to its 1st chapter and you get the feeling that John Lasseter, director, was just let loose, no one stepping in his way to put his pet project on the right tracks.Other reviewers explain its Bond-like premise, a global travel movie following Maters exploits as an 'accidental' spy. And everyones favourite Lightning McQueen? He's sidelined, almost a cameo appearance from Owen Wilson. Which begs the question- why did he bother? Larry the Cable Guys' Mater was the comic relief in the first film but is now promoted to lead, stretching every audience member to the limit with his corny and mind-numbing jokes.The story is hard to follow, especially for its supposed target audience, and its excessive use of violence makes me question its 'U' rating. It starts off well enough with a prologue featuring the ever-watchable Michael Caine. But as soon as we arrive in the familiar surroundings of Radiator Springs, everything takes a turn for the worse..Oh why, Pixar.....",,Anonymous,Animation

This is less of Days of Thunder and more James Bond.While many people have disliked this movie, though I think unfairly.

Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Cars 2,"Cars 2 picks up several years after the first with Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) ruling the Piston Cup. This leads him to be invited to the first World Grand Prix where he can pit himself against the best of the rest and in particular Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro) the cocky Italian stallion F1 car. McQueen's crew led by Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) gather together and set out on the trip of a lifetime to Japan, Italy and England to fight for the right to be named the best in the world. While McQueen is off racing, Mater finds himself caught up in the secret world of government spies and espionage.First off the graphics and world in which Pixar create is stunning with no little detail overlooked. Bringing some of the scenes into real world venues also helped to show off the talent of the people at Pixar. It was also interesting to see how cars go about your average human tasks such as flying on a plane and even going to the toilet with the phenomenal background detail dragging you into the film- plane pigeons were one of many nice touches. It sounds strange to say but at some points you almost forget you are watching cars.The comedy level was good throughout and with a good (although somewhat predictable and disjointed) plot that hugged the Bond style template closely this has many things going for it. I don't think it's an out and out kids movie and would probably stick it in the young adult section but as with most Pixar, it transcends all the age boundaries.The real problem I found with the film is that although the environment is great, it's quite hard for the graphics team to be overly expressive with the cars themselves which lead me to not connect with the characters as much as I would have liked. If you don't feel for the characters then the rest of the film starts to fall away beneath you. Also the plot is split into two separate stories so that at some points it feels like you are watching two movies rather than one.Mater, while he worked well as a bit character in the original seems to be the main character for this which is a role less suited to him. He is a simple minded car who gets most of his laughs through slapstick which works well in small doses but not so much for the entire film. The lack of progression in character development from the first to this one also lets the film down with the lessons merely being relearned by the same characters again.Out of all of Pixar's creations, I have always felt that the Cars franchise was the weakest of the group and Cars 2 has failed change my opinion. Yes the graphics are some of the best yet and the world is very immersive but as characters go something was lacking and the whole idea of the film didn't gel. Considering this is their 25th anniversary, I would have expected the cream of the crop but instead was only treated to a just above average performance. The graphics drag it into a higher rating.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",,Anonymous,Animation
Cinematic masterpiece,"Beautiful story, pacing, voice acting and animation would shag it if I could 12/10",,Anonymous,Animation
Not the strongest  Pixar movie,"Cars 2 has the pacing of a long Chevron commercial with nice visuals. Pixar's track record has been close to untouchable when crafting their films. Their movie are geared toward children with the thought process of parents interest in mind. They create intelligent, emotionally driven, beautifully detailed animated films, with plenty of humor and heart to appeal to movie for parents and children both to enjoy. With this in mind the creators of films behind the Pixar brand forgot about these elements when making a sequel to the off center original. The makers of the first Cars shied away from those various things to a certain degree and just intended the film to be loved by kids. Cars one was not a bad film at all just not as good or on the same level as its counterparts.The first Cars turn out nice box office numbers despite the some bad reviews by Pixar fans and what they were looking for, but hit home to the children expectation and imagination. In knowing that, this movie take that leap again that the first movie makes and tries to leap again and falls short of the capable entertainment. Cars 2 does not feel like a Pixar film at all, but resembles something that Dream works ( not hating on those movies) would have put out. It does not connect with me emotionally as a fan of Pixars various other films. Kids will enjoy every minute of this, witnessing all the new automobiles that the movie presents on the course of it's running time, but for older generation this movie may be a hit and miss. I for one did not care for the route that this film took and making a sequel. In viewing the first movie at the end of it I felt that it was a complete movie not needing a forced sequel like it received.The movie sequel feels like a straight to DVD quality film or a cartoon movie that would be screened on Disney channel or children networks. They also didn't explored the characters that were loved in the first movie. Every scene the audience was introduced to a new character which became the down fall of this film. They displayed some nice roles, but overcrowded the story of the two main characters that we wanted to know more about. Besides the action and some nicely displayed cars that made it to the film this movie just loses it's flame that it had in the first. The director placed the whole spy flick theme into the film to serve as a distraction for kids so they can introduce new cars. The plot didn't fit right with the whole world of Cars 1. One thing that Disney has done in this film that made it a passable movie is add this element to introduce the action that the first movie didn't have. They knew that another Cars original story line would not work a second time so they went this route to create another film for kids. The idea that Pixar has done was smart and inventive to capitalize on merchandize, but it was a fail attempt.This movie also lacks in comedy and heart that was also present in the first movie, but improve on the visual which are beautiful. Mator became annoying at times and served no purpose while he was on screen and I just never connected to the film as a older audience member. That is how this movie lacks the Pixar brand name influence because it falls short in those categories. Compared to the numerous dazzling hits that Pixar Studio has released in the past years, this film is a great disappointment to their track record, but can still achieve box office glory with the amount of fans of the first that this franchise has. With the growing number of animation films that have been put out in the last 10 years that are not under the umbrella of Pixar Studio's, this film still couldn't make the list of the top animation movies to date.",,Anonymous,Animation
A James Bond movie for children! Why???,"This was a disappointment for me.I went to the theater with my 6 y.o. boy that loves the first ""Cars"". Unfortunately, it was very boring for him and he wanted to leave.I believe that the plot of this movie is very complicated for a child. It is some kind of fun for an adult that likes James Bond movies, but what a child would understand about this all?So, I am wondering what the target group of this movie is supposed to be? The children cannot understand it and for the adults is a spy cartoon movie with cars instead of people !?!I think the purpose of making this movie is lost somehow.",,Anonymous,Animation
What the heck?,"I loved the first cars movie. I really did. Then when I checked out Apple TV, I saw that Cars 2 is coming out, it showed Lightning and Mater with spy gadgets. What?

The story goes something like this, there's a cup that lightning goes to, (a race) then Mater becomes a secret agent for some reason. That's all I can gather. And then they meet another car, it's just a mess. So, the story is nearly nonexistent. It felt as if Pixar just wanted to cash in. Also, if you want to make a movie with an ""intricate storyline"", try to do it without making the viewers zone out.",,Anonymous,Animation
Not up to par,"Cars 2 isn't a bad movie, but it was clearly more designed to sell toys than to be enjoyed at the theatre. The story was completely uninspired and at times too complex for kids. It was a tad too violent for my taste but not to the point to scare a kid or hurt the kids psyche in any way, but I get the feeling that all the explosions were there just to keep interest as the story itself wasn't enough. But what bothered me the most was the ending. Or lack thereof. From Toy Story all Pixar movies have memorable endings. Some almost make me cry every time I see them (""I wasn't aiming for the truck"" in Toy Story 1, saved by the claw in Toy Story 3, Mc Queen sacrificing his Piston Cup for an ailing King). Cars 2 simply didn't have a memorable ending by any standard. It just happened, and I'm sure in a few weeks I won't even remember what it was. A completely forgettable movie, and I think that's a definitive first for Pixar. What a shame.",,Anonymous,Animation
Does life begin at ignition?,"The story begins Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) accompanies Lightning (Wilson) to a series of races around the world, and gets mistaken for an international spy.What I thinkIf there are no people, I wonder who built the first car. How did automobiles create all of the civilizations of the world without fingers? If they didn't build everything, what did they do with the bodies after they rose up and killed their human overlords? Why do they have passenger doors? If Lightning McQueen rolled down a window, would you see his brain? Is that a pair of eyes in each car's windshield, or one big eye with two pupils? Why do buck teeth indicate low intelligence? Why do New York accents indicate criminality? Does the undercarriage of a male car differ from that of a female car? Does life begin at ignition?The movie is fast-paced fun, superbly animated as always, with the usual clever Pixar touches, and I recommend 3D to increase the gee-whiz factor.A request If you can read Japanese, please let me know if there are any additional witticisms on the signs in Tokyo.Why you should see it Cool! Vvvvvmmm! Vrrrrmmmm! Attractive, single parents.Why you shouldn't see it Right now, finding the nearest hospital is more important than finding the nearest movie theater. The name ""Mater"" is too sexual.--from my review at www.1man365movies.com",,Anonymous,Animation
