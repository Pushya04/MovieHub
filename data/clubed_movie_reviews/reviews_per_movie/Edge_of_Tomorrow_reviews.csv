"Clever, intense Sci-Fi spectacle; offers nearly as much humor as it does excitement along with a great, unexpected turn from Tom Cruise","Wow - this was unexpected. The trailers had me believe that after 'Battle L.A.' and 'Oblivion' this would be yet another bleak, action- packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about an alien invasion - what the trailers failed to convey almost entirely is that over long stretches, this is also seasoned with nearly as much humor as 'Groundhog Day'. That it would invite comparisons with the Harold Ramis/ Bill Murray classic was obvious, given the time loop premise, but I never expected to what extent those comparisons would actually be justified and that this film would really tap into a similar kind of comedy. Luckily, it is all the better for it.Most unexpected of all, the main reason the comical aspects during the first half of the film work so well, is Tom Cruise's character, Major William Cage. This is easily Cruise's meatiest role since his turn in 'Magnolia' as Frank T.J. Mackey; forget his usual stern, poster boy heroes: here he plays an entirely different character – and he really seems to relish the opportunity. I won't give away too much, but be prepared to chuckle and laugh when you see a new side of Tom Cruise.Yet while this is not nearly as bleak as the trailers suggested, it certainly isn't a comedy either. And it absolutely IS an action-packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about battling an alien invasion (the trailers got that right), albeit one with a funny bone and great characters. Speaking of which, the rest of the cast is also very good, especially the gorgeous Emily Blunt. It seems that no matter what she does, she always comes across as genuine and real; here she succeeds in portraying her character - a tough, seasoned soldier other soldiers refer to as ""full metal bitch"" (no kidding!) - with just the right touch of vulnerability to make her that much more believable. Bill Paxton and Brendon Gleeson are always a welcome addition to any movie, and while they are great (as usual), character-wise, they don't do anything here that you haven't seen them do before.As for the Sci-Fi spectacle that the trailers promised, I'm glad to report that the film delivers. The battle scenes are beautifully orchestrated (not the Transformer-style blur where you can't make out anything anymore), and there are moments when the intensity of the fighting recalls the landing on Omaha Beach in 'Saving Private Ryan' - without the gore, obviously (after all, this is PG-13). The design of the aliens - the production design in general - is incredibly well done, although I would lie if I said it was something ground-breaking and new the way the first 'Matrix' was (it IS breathtaking, though).So my verdict: With one of the most inventive (adapted) scripts for an original (mega-budget) film in a long time and the best Tom Cruise we've seen in years, 'Edge of Tomorrow' will have you chuckle and laugh nearly as much as drop your jaw in awe: this is what Hollywood should take as a blueprint for exciting summer entertainment henceforth. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Hoped for a good movie .. got an amazing one instead (No Spoiler),"After watching the trailer i was really hyped about the movie because of its theme and potential to be a really good movie. But on the other side i knew how bad the most potential good movies in the past ended up. I was scared that they screw it up and give us another Oblivion or Ilisium with much cgi-effects and bad story and no real story and/or characters.So i took my girlfriend and went in the movie with mixed feelings. But then, right from the beginning, i knew this movie would be fantastic. The first minutes really hooked me and i found myself in a funny, filled with perfect action and intelligent movie. You had the feeling like you were directly in it and you really feel with Tom Cruise from the beginning to the end. I don't like Tom Cruise in general but this role just fits him. Nobody who sees this movie could deny this. From minute to minute i was more and more in this fantastic story and wanted to last forever. But eventually the movie ended and i was really satisfied with everything.Two main characters who played perfectly, a fascinating story well told and really fast and good looking action made it for me the best movie i watched in a while (and i watch pretty much movies). Even though i don't like to recommend movies because of different tastes I really want to do this with this movie. The story is well told and there are no boring repeatings. Even my girlfriend who normally don't like movies with much action liked it a lot and added Emily Blunt to one of her favorite actresses of all time.Oh well, 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Brilliant Film, one of my personal favorites","It's hard to compromise how a film of such similar plot development to Groundhog Day can be considered to be such a great action movie, but like the events in this film, you just have to see it to believe it. Edge of Tomorrow is honestly my favorite Tom Cruise movie, and when you have such a great track record like Cruise, that's really saying something. The film is phenomenal, as with Groundhog Day it follows a similar plot, but it certainly has a different way at going at the themes it develops. Cruise and Blunt make a terrific pair in this action/sci-fi/thriller and the film is nothing short of brilliant. The special effects are mesmerizing, the look of the film daunting, and yet nostalgic and fully realized. I love the development of the world we find our characters in, and all the aliens it involves. I love nearly every aspect of this film, and although on the surface it may not seem original, it certainly feels that way. In the end, Edge of Tomorrow is a must see action flick that will have audiences on the edge of their seats, and is a must see for any Sci-=fi or Cruise fan in general.
My Rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a Fantastic Movie!,"Superb! I rarely get to go to a movie with my older son after his siblings came along. We did manage to go to this movie in the cinemas. Not only were we glad we chose this movie to watch, but two years later, we still recall the impact this movie had on both of us.This science fiction story is deeply satisfying. The movie treats the viewers as intelligent people. It is not in the same league of a plethora of science fiction movies that hit the cinemas every year. For example this year we have Independence Day 2, a high budget sequel to a high budget b-movie from a long time ago. It is profoundly forgettable. That is in stark contrast to Edge of Tomorrow, which has stayed with me for so long and today motivated me to come here on IMDb to write a review after two years!This movie is a must watch. Thanks for reading.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Witty and thrilling summer blockbuster with Tom Cruise in top form,"You could describe this movie as a dizzying combination of Groundhog Day, Starship Troopers, Source Code and The Butterfly Effect. Edge of Tomorrow borrows from these films and while some of the individual ideas may not therefore be groundbreakingly original, the way they're combined and put to use in Edge of Tomorrow by director Doug Liman certainly is. As aliens have invaded Earth, humanity's only hope lies in a cowardly PR officer Bill Cage (played by Tom Cruise) with no combat skills who is sent to the front lines. His only advantage? A save point, sort of. Are you excited yet? You should be. I don't want to tell you more specifics about the plot because it's best to experience and discover this great piece of work yourself.You have to love Tom Cruise as an actor, he always gives his roles a 100 percent and he's phenomenal in Edge of Tomorrow - Physical, funny and determined. I'd say this is his best performance since Collateral. Emily Blunt is fantastically badass as the poster girl of the war, Rita Vrataski. This is her first real action film and she knocks it out of the park. Cruise and Blunt also have great chemistry together. Bill Paxton and Brandon Gleeson give great supporting performances and most of the supporting soldiers have distinct personalities even with their limited screen times.Edge of Tomorrow's world building is slick and credible. The CGI and the special effects are seamless and bring the great set pieces and the relentless aliens to life. The action is really exhilarating (the cool exoskeleton suits definitely help here) and the script is very witty and inventive as it needs to be when you're dealing with time travel (or time resets if you will). Despite its action thrills Edge of Tomorrow finds plenty of room for character development both for Cruise and Blunt. The script also manages to pull off some quite funny scenes (especially in the training segment). I also have to mention James Herbert's snappy editing because it's that good. The the situations could get old really fast if it wasn't for the fast-paced editing that concisely and freshly shows the differences in each repetition Cruise goes through. The pacing is absolutely relentless and there isn't a boring moment in the film.The tone of the film is pretty much perfect for a summer blockbuster. It's not overly morose or gloomy despite the backdrop of an alien invasion. Instead it opts for wit, fun and action thrills. I was really gripped from start to finish and I had this big grin on my face when I left the theater. I really liked the other recent blockbusters in Godzilla and X-Men: Days of Future Past but Edge of Tomorrow surpasses them both. If only every summer blockbuster was such good fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Summer Blockbuster Not To Be Missed,"One of the most ingenious film concepts ever created, a cross between 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Groundhog Day', 'Edge of Tomorrow' is a gripping and clever blockbuster sci-fi thrill-ride accompanied with taut, fast-paced action and compelling direction. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt form a perfect chemistry that takes them from the training ground, to the battlefield through to the action-bound finale in Paris. The premise of the time-loop has been used many times before, but this time round there are enough exciting visuals and dynamic storytelling skills employed to make this one thrilling (and unexpectedly comedic) flick that is unpredictable and expertly designed. A model of cinematic craftsmanship.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Groundhog Day"" crossed with ""Starship Troopers""","Director Doug Limon made some of my favorite action thrillers of the past two decades: the first of wildly successful Matt Damon ""Bourne"" films, the movie which would give us Brangelina (""Mr. & Mrs. Smith""), and even a better than usual TV series, ""Cover Affairs"" starring Piper Perabo. Tom Cruise personally asked for him to direct ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" and Limon agreed to because the character Tom plays is NOT good at his (largely ceremonial) military position; the two have made a better movie as a result. Cruise also asked Emily Blunt, a fine actress with zero action film experience, to be in this one, and their rapport elevates it. Her own character, Rita, IS exceptional at her job as a battle-hardened vet. This silly sci-fi plot involves some global alien invasion in which certain aliens can ""reset"" time. So our 2 protagonists proceed to fight and die, together or separately, on the same day, over and over again, dozens if not hundreds of times. The issue, as with all wars, is how the 2 soldiers start to know and care about one another, so when the time comes to end the conflict and die once & for all, the 2 don't want to go for good. So I rate this one a 7.5 out of 10 stars. Rumors abound that a sequel's in preproduction. Hmm.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Love, love this movie",One of the best time travel and action movies. I can watch over and over again. Each time you watch you see something you missed in earlier viewings. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt have great chemistry. I love them both in this.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Starship Troopers, meet Groundhog Day","I don't like Tom Cruise. I don't dislike him, either. I just don't care. He is Tom Cruise in every, single movie. But I love Emily Blunt, the Full Metal Bitch (says so on the bus). She is incredible badass here, and thouroughly inspired by various characters from Starship Troopers, with a spice of R. Lee Ermey on top. It's a really entertaining movie for 2/3, when Cage (Tom) is a spineless desk officer called out on duty to kill bugs. Which don't go very well. But hey, he at least gets killed by the RIGHT bug monster, and for REASONS he gets to experience to be Bill Murray, and gets killed a lot of times. This is the GOOD part of the movie. The BAD part is when he and Emily teams up to kill bugs (cause Cage can now remember everything that will happen), and the movies last 3rd turns into a version of the Fallout games combined with Independence Day. We have one shot at this, etc.... but until that flat ending, it's a real joy to finally watch Tom Cruise getting killed in funny ways. You can say it's a dream coming trough for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
BETTER than I was expecting!,"I saw the trailer of this, but was expecting another campy ""Independence Day"" trying to be too funny, ""War of the Worlds"" that tried to be too serious or ""District 9"" that was FX for FX sake. I probably would have not gone, but my date said her daughter saw it and loved it.Wow, was I surprised! The characters make the movie. Cruise's less-than-perfect, frustrated but determined ""Cage"" quickly got me rooting for him. Emily Blunt's serious ""Rita"" was a great mirror image protagonist.The special effects were so clean and well integrated that they didn't overpower the story or become center stage. Instead, they added to bringing in me into making the unreal premise more real.In the end, this is probably the coolest sci-fi love story I have ever seen. It is nice to see that Hollywood can still produce something other than the formulaic trash that usually keeps me away from the theaters. Warner Brothers, thanks for putting $178 million on the table to make this!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Tom Cruise trying to get past the last saving point,"The parrallels with Groundhog Day are obvious to anyone who has seen that movie. As an avid video game enjoyer I couldn't see the film as anything else but leveling up a character, acquiring new skills and knowledge, exploring the posibilities of the enviroment. If you happen to misstep, you are back to square one, trying something else in hope to finish the quest.Even Emily Blunt looks like she came from a video game, she fights the mimics with a sword?? That image of her on the passing bus looking badass, may as well be one of the characters in Tekken.The movie is all about the two protagonists and their chemistry is undeniable. The mutual foundness they develop is touching. It's a science fiction film that certainly felt novel and distinctive.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Tomorrow, you will forget ""Edge of Tomorrow""","If you've seen the trailers for ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" you are familiar with the basic concept. Tom Cruise's character is sent into a battle against aliens and gains the ability to re-live that day every time he dies. This quick description covers approximately 90% of what you see in ""Edge of Tomorrow.""As some kind of recruiting agent, the military decides that it's a good idea to dump Tom on the front lines because...um, well that's never explained (maybe this is why humanity is losing?). Quite a lot is not explained in this movie, but let's forget about that for now, and talk about what you're supposed to concentrate on: the explosions. Over and over again, we get to see Tom run through the battlefield with Blondie McSoldier, his somewhat romantic interest and mentor in this affair. They kill aliens, he dies, and then...they kill aliens some more.Over and over and over and over, explosions, shooting and Tom dying. A couple of these deaths are done in a humorous way, but overall it becomes a tiresome mechanic that long overstays its welcome. Somewhere along the way, we're told how they might possibly beat the aliens by, you guessed it, explosions, shooting and dying. Also, with the deus ex machina that they eventually use, which could have been used at any point along the way, because the film has to end eventually.I don't know what else there is to say about this movie. None of the characters are developed beyond ""soldier,"" ""girl,"" drill sergeant,"" ""scientist,"" and the action becomes repetitious and boring about halfway through. To its credit, the aliens, mech armor, and battles all look very impressive. But with no background to the events, characters, or anything that's happening, I had a very difficult time becoming invested in any of it.The ""Groundhog Day"" concept is not even the problem, as films such as ""Source Code"" have demonstrated. You can have action, repeating timelines, AND character development. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" falls into the usual Hollywood trap of simply throwing lots of CGI at the screen and hoping that it will be enough to carry the film. It's not. Audiences are more intelligent than this, and deserve better films.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wht do you want? A good movie? A spectacular movie? An Exceptional movie? You're reading the review of one,"I was enjoying my Sunday evening watching the World Test Championship Final against India and New Zealand until the dark clouds hovered at the sky in Southampton and stopped the play. I switched to Netflix, searched for a movie and played one, however, eventually I was going to go back watching Cricket once it started. Guess what? I never did until I ended. Cricket runs through my blood. My two most favourite teams were at the cricket ground facing each other for the ultimate battle of the World Championship with millions of people supporting both. I was so mesmerized in the movie, I hardly checked out the score. Edge of Tomorrow took me to such an edge of my seat for long I farted almost a hundred times unknowingly. (It's quite a deal-breaker if you're planning to watch a movie with me.) I was profoundly engaged in it for what's going to come. Even good movies have several dull moments, I could hardly figure out one in this movie. Although the first few minutes got me thinking why are they trying to mix The US Army with The UK. This movie has almost everything in it. A package full of entertainment including Action, Sci-fi, adventure and a little bit of comedy whenever they got a chance to add some. The actors were amazing. Tom Cruise and Emily Brunt were so good can't expect better. The others didn't really have much to do with all the limelight shared between the two of them, however, at the end all came out remarkable. Special effects could have been better largely, considering it was a high-budget movie. Also, one thing which could be elaborated more was about the antagonist. I feel their side should have been shown a little.Truthfully, we humans are always curious to know more about them. All that was focused on were the two protagonists.

great sci-fi,"An alien race has invaded the Earth starting in Europe. After 5 years of relentless defeats where the Mimics seem to anticipate every move, the United Defense Force finally has a victory with the invention of a new jacket technology. Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) is hailed as an example of the new success. William Cage (Tom Cruise) is a military media officer. General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) is sending him on the first wave to cover the expected victory. He is arrested and forced to fight under Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton). He manages to kill a large Mimic. He is sprayed with its blood and dies. He wakes up the previous morning as a prisoner about to go into battle.The action is fantastic. The idea is terrific. Tom Cruise starts as his arrogant stock character and transition into his superhero stock character. Emily Blunt continues to excel in a character reminiscent of her character in Looper.

This year's most surprising blockbuster movie so far,"With thrilling action sequences, clever sense of humor and surprisingly intellectual storyline, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" shows a real deal of summer blockbuster movie and proves itself beyond expectation especially after unconvincing trailers. Perhaps the theme and alien character looks familiar with some popular sci-fi movies but it's still combined perfectly as an entertainment. Doug Liman as director smartly exploited 're-setting the day' aspect without making it complicated and escaping it from being dull with some quality combat moments also inserting lovable drama that is commanded by memorable chemistry from Tom Cruise and Emilly Blunt have carried whole scenes in it. Overall ""Edge of Tomorrow"" feels more satisfying than it might have been in any ways and shows how the non-sequel-reboot blockbuster movie should be done. It's definitely much fun than I have ever imagined and pleasurable to re-watch it over and over again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Like Groundhog Day with guns,"So Tom Cruise has been back again with the latest sci-fi, Edge of Tomorrow. After his great performance in Oblivion, he made it again in this comedy-filled tasty Twinkie. Not to say this film is all comedy,and there was too much action to categorize it as nice drama movie. What I was going to say is, this movie has all the movie needs to be enjoyable.Private Cage is brought down to warfare against aliens, without reading ""Exoskeleton Suit for Dummies"" first. But oh my, he had this curse that Phil had in Punxsutawney that he had to die and respawn, and over and over and (over) again that he granted from an alien he killed.I don't know, but apparently, the screenwriter was inspired by ""Groundhog Day"", which is a good thing. The pace really done well by describing Cage deals with time-loop. There are many possibilities of a man's mind could think to take advantage of a powerful curse, and I think they explore this well, just like Groundhog Day.Good thing comes from the characters. They are lovable and some of them have great quotes. Emily Blunt really nailed the character of a hard-soldier that shared same fate with Cage in the past. She really balanced Tom Cruise's performance.But enough exaggerating, shall I? There are minus-es too. Always. The first one is the lack of pre-invasion imaging of Earth(I am not really sure for this one, because I missed first five minutes of the movie). Damn, they should have made the detail about the mimic's purpose and maybe, a little twist in the credits that could open a gate for sequels (duh!). The second, well, I think there is no second minus.Even it is not perfect, I believe they have exceeded the edge of making a sci-fi well-balanced, either from the storyline and action. Really worth to watch in cinema. And btw, forget Godzilla, the storyline sucks.(no h8 kaiju fans)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Edge of Tomorrow is a fantastic action movie based on the ""Groundhog Day"" concept","Edge of Tomorrow is a fantastic action movie based on the ""Groundhog Day"" concept. A good cast here contrasts with the mediocre plot, which basically uses the concept of repeating the same day over and over again. It was possible to make an excellent plot from this story, but in place of this the viewer gets the same shots most of the film. The same Source Code implements it much better. What else can you say about Edge of Tomorrow? If you put aside the plot, it's a good fantastic action movie, there are beautiful large-scale action scenes, the main thing is not to include logic when watching them. If you consider Edge of Tomorrow as a whole as a movie, it's not bad. It will go for a one-time viewing, you'll forget the next day.

It;'s Groundhog's Day,Take the 1993 classic Bill Murray flick and make the short furry guy the star minus the comedy and include lots of guns and you have Edge of Tomorrow. Interesting in theory except it completely throws the entire concept of linear time out the window with the 2nd or 3rd revival. If the actions of a single person do not change the outcome of everyone around them then this movie makes perfect sense. Why altering ones choices does not result in a completely different outcome is completely against the theory it is based on (but it is still entertaining to watch which is why it got a 6 instead of much lower).

Has been done many times before... gets boring,"Too many things in one movie... They needed to just focus on one genre. Mechs vs aliens, or time travel.

It's been used too many times in other movies: Butterfly Effect, Source Code, Groundhog Day, Repeaters... etc.The only difference here is that there are also mechs & aliens. The aliens are uncreative & do not look scary. They are like robotic octopuses on hyper mode that make Transformer noises.. As for the mechs... nothing impressive here, the design looks lame. Also, you don't get to see a lot of sword action, despite what the movie poster shows. There's not a whole lot of mech action at all actually.. which is a bit misleading, since this movie is more about the time-travel element than about mech vs alien warfare.If you've seen Butterfly Effect & other similar films, you probably won't be impressed much by this.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

How would the Brain retain any information if it is time traveling? Is the brain impervious to time? The Aliens looked so silly too, hardly looked the smart technological beings who can control time.

"Overrated, but a fun film","I've been waiting for HBO to broadcast this film for quite some time and I had high expectations based on the positive reviews this film has garnered. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed, and I'll tell you why without spoiling anything.Now I won't go on and mention the lack of characterization or emotional depth. That's not why some stories are told--especially science fiction stories--which are usually always plot driven. Still, after the first twenty minutes, which happened to be contain the most engrossing moments in the film, I found myself wondering if this story would wind up as some mindless circus film and it wound up being the case.The villains were very shallow things, with no motives whatsoever. And if science fiction is supposed to be plot driven, then, this film's plot could have had more depth. As a matter of fact, this wasn't even a science fiction movie at all, but rather an action movie. And so if the villain is shallow and without motives, chances are, that the hero will be shallow as well. A hero is defined by the degree of the antagonist's villainy after all. And the hero, Major Cage (played brilliantly by Tom Cruise) was just a soldier in a war, with a gift. His plight was simple. Save the world from evil robotic aliens.The action was fun. I bet this looked great in the theaters. I just hoped for something more. Something more politically driven, conspiratorial, or philosophical. In the end, it's a fairly unique story, with some clever directing and cool action scenes--but that's it. I admire the script and the slow dramatic buildup that the time loop creates. Each new day that Major Cage experiences led to new discoveries and new ways for him to defeat his enemy. I may watch this again simply for Tom Cruise's excellent performance--and of course--the impressive fireworks.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Underrated movie.,This film is one of the best movies Tom Cruise has ever done. It's fast-paced and suspenseful with a wry sense of humor.It definitely will keep you on the edge of your seat.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Terrific presentation, I mean, really terrific!","This is a great film, quite underrated. It's actually a classic in my view, the action is really well done but it's funny and the characters have some depth, so it's got that same X factor that die hard and other action classics have. Watch it many times. You won't regret it. Now... time for some PT.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pleasantly surprised,"Going into watching this movie, I'll be honest, I didn't expect much. I figured it was probably just some usual sci-fi movie with crappy effects and a lack of an actually interesting and full plot. The only thing that gave me hope was that Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt were the stars of the movie. Soon enough, I realized I had seriously doubted this movie way more than I should have.First off, I love Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise, and their acting in this was phenomenal. It was fun to see Cruise in a role where he was helpless and lost; out of place (in the beginning), while Blunt was the badass female who trained him and built him up. Speaking of Blunt, her character Rita was a truly incredible character in my opinion, and Blunt did an excellent job of portraying her.Now onto the plot: this is where I was initially worried when I began the movie. However, I found myself really enjoying the movie very soon in, after catching onto some things. It made me think, which I liked, but also wasn't so unclear that I couldn't figure anything out. I thought that the time loop idea was very interesting and unique for a sci-fi movie, and even though things kept repeating, I was never bored or felt like there wasn't enough happening. I loved the action in this movie, and also the more tender moments between Rita and Cage. Movies that can make you cry and make you sit on the edge of your seat in suspense always intrigue me, and that's what this movie did for me. I just didn't want it to end.Side notes: I've watched some behind the scenes footage of this movie, and either all or a majority of the action sequences that we see in the movie were filmed, not inserted using CGI, which is very impressive. But to me, not more impressive than the fact that Blunt and Cruise each did their own stunts. These actors are so amazing in my opinion.
The only reason that this movie is getting 9 and not 10 stars from me is that I felt towards the beginning of the movie, the whole time loop thing was being dragged out a bit too much, I wanted things to move a bit quicker.*These are simply my opinions. I respect anyone and everyone's opinions, even if I don't agree with them, and I ask that you do the same with my review and others. Thank you.*",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This movie is a perfect example of a 10!

Tom cruise was phenomenal as usual hes so Underrated as an actor and the fact he does his own stunts shows is dedication to his craft. Emily blunt was great as well actually everyone was top notch. We've seen this film at least a dozen times and it gets better everytime.

Right On Military Sci Fi,"Tom Cruise plays an ad man army Major who, through the whim of a commander, finds himself heading into combat against an alien force of spider-like creatures that have the ability to restructure time. Cruise is killed numerous times by these things and always come back to the same place. He learns more about the mission and the creatures each time he goes back. In the process, he meets a female war hero played by Emily Blunt who has the same time warping thing going on. The proceed to relive the same times over and over. She, unfortunately, has no recollection of what was done. This is powerful, intelligent science fiction with a knock dead premise. Yes, ""Wake up, Maggot"" is this movie's ""I Got You, Babe,"" from ""Groundhog Day."" And the idea of reliving our day over and over isn't brand new, but the battle scenes are awesome and the aliens powerful and disgusting. There is a wonderful bond that develops between Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. It isn't the maudlin empty headed stuff like we saw in ""Independence Day"" many years ago. We really get to care about the people. This movie really surprised me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Little Too Drawn Out and Convoluted,"Eh, I followed everything, for the most part, but I have to say that by the final act I just wanted to get to the point and the end; there's only so many times it is fun watching the day repeat with a nuance to Tom Cruise's changes to show he's been here before.Additionally, although much time is spent describing the alpha and omega and their dynamic operating functions and locations, frankly they are never quite developed in a manner to invoke respect and fear as a main villain. As such, the stakes are never appreciated, with the script instead lopsided focused on the daily repetition and characters. Blunt was very good in this, by the way. Cruise is always good, buyt he's just himself in everything, nothing remarkably different here, not far removed from MI or War of Worlds Cruise.I don't know, like it was entertaining for a somewhat fun action movie, but I believe it's overrated at 7.9. I wouldn't look forward to viewing it again: a decent one-watch boring night diversion.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Love this movie,"Re-watched it again for the first time in years and it is still amazing. If you are into sci-fi, video games, action, adventure, etc this is a MUST watch film. Emily and Tom really came at this with their A GAME, and really when you think about how absurd/nerdy the concept can be it's much appreciated. The dialogue was also really well written and the editing top notch. I think about the multitude of ways you can really screw this up and they didn't is so impressive. I am shocked the director has not done a follow up or sci fi film since.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Billed as a sci-fi love story it's a weird one...,"I was going to pass on ""Edge of Tomorrow"" but elected to see it based on the high review average and my general love for sci-fi. Although I have loved several of Tom Cruise's movies over the years I'd stop short of saying I'm a fan; I certainly didn't see this movie because he had top billing.Bottom-line this movie doesn't suck but don't expect it to blow you out of your seat either. Basically ""Groundhog Day"" mashed-up with ""Aliens"" and ""Starship Troopers"". See it in 2D definitely and maybe matinée. Definitely a one-shot for me. I found myself checking my email a couple of times (except when Emily Blunt was on the screen that is!) Billed as a sci-fi love story - it was a weird one. Strange chemistry between Cruise and Blunt -- almost like he's trying too hard and she's doing her best but we know her heart's not really into it. I don't know how to describe it...weird vibe.Was great to see Bill Paxton as a cocky grunt again!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
On the EDGE..........of GROUNDHOG DAY?????,"As regards EDGE, sorry, but it is pretty much of an impossibility for me to sit down and write a completely unbiased review. In my case, this film will always be viewed through the lens of Groundhog Day, one of my all- time favorite movies, my favorite film to share with my English students and, most definitely, my #1 Romantic-Comedy of all time! But despite the fact that I have seen Groundhog Day, from beginning to end, at least 2 dozen times, this is supposed to be a review of EDGE, so let's turn our focus there:It is easy to understand why so many IMDb-ers have awarded 9 or 10 stars to this ""EDGY"" Sci-Fi near classic, I suppose if it hadn't been for the reason so clearly spelled out above, I, undoubtedly, would have done the same! Still, EDGE possesses many standalone qualities that have motivated me to give it a well-deserved 8 Stars! FIRST: Here, Tom Cruise's character, Cage, is a die-hard desk jockey PR/Marketing mature-media- pretty-face type, who seems, at least initially, to have an anaphylactic shock reaction to any and all bellicose activities encoded in his DNA! I find this an extremely amusing tongue in cheek poke at himself in some of his earlier Mr. Invincible, Super Macho, Ethan Hunt and Jack Reacher type roles!Another critical factor working in its favor: EDGE is anything BUT a ""leave your brain at the door"" mindless Action/Sci-Fi flick, unlike so many of your typical Hollywood ""Action/Sci-Fi"" counterparts! If your focus wanders, you could be asking yourself, ""OOPS! What just happened!?!?""EDGE almost constantly challenges you to re-evaluate your opinions and the relevance of what has transpired on screen! But don't get me wrong, EDGE has enough mind-numbing action to satisfy even the most exigent of action movie junkies! At the same time, it also presents us with some rather inspired and original plot twists. (Don't worry, No Spoilers AHEAD!)Speaking of originality, perhaps this is the perfect moment to mention that despite that its driving force idea seems to be a blatant rip-off of Groundhog Day, at least EDGE manages to impart a good deal of fresh spin to the concept, so as to give it quite a unique life of its own.From a technical standpoint, as is the case with most Hollywood big budget productions nowadays, Cinematography, sound, sound mixing, editing, effects, pretty much everything is extremely professionally done. Screenplay, three people with long names listed, is actually engrossing and quite engaging. For those of you who usually ""PASS"" on this genre, I would venture to say that quite a good number of you might find putting yourself on EDGE might be more than worth your while!ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Independence Day meets Groundhog Day...not in a good way,"The special effects are good, the aliens are...well, wonderfully alien, but the story relies on time travel and the repetition gets monotonous and you pretty much can guess how it is all going to end.If these aliens are so smart they can shift time, what are they doing invading planets like Earth. The convoluted logic as to why Tom has to keep repeating the day is so shaky it ruins the plot.I figure I am not adding a spoiler since the movie was renamed to add ""Live, Die, Repeat"" to the tile Edge of Tomorrow, just in case you didn't quite get it.Always looking for good sci-fi movies.

Single handedly the best Action/Sci-Fi movie in 2014 and the most underrated.,"It is deferentially the best Si-Fi, Action, Drama and even comedy movie of the year ... amazing story, connected plot, unexpected satisfying ending.The storyline is so thrilling .. every scene is intriguing in its own way ,, even if they give the same story in the scene, its repeat will have this small tick that makes it different.Tom cruise did a hell of job, his face expressions on the movie just memorizing, makes you be in the movie itself. and those comedic, ironic bits on the movie made it more attracting.If you watched it once you will definitely watch it again and again ,, then again some scenes !! ;) the screenplay writers are geniuses they made hell of twists all along the movie and bravo for Doug Liman for a fabulous directing. not being nominated for two academy awards minimum for best actor and directing or writing was just totally unfair !! well since we're here i'm off to watching the movie once again ;)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Carpe Diem, Carpe Diem, Carpe Diem ...","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Doug Liman is best known for his fine work at the beginning of the ""Bourne"" franchise. His latest has so many obstacles to overcome, a tip of the cap is in order for a thriller that isn't altogether without merit.These obstacles include such things the all too familiar sub-genre of alien-invasion, an overload of special effects, a familiar actress in an unfamiliar action-hero role, and above all others, the casting of the divisive Tom Cruise ... whose detractors will certainly get a kick out of the nearly endless stream of on screen deaths his character experiences. After all, what's more fun than bashing Cruise over and over and over again? On the plus side, the special effects are very well done; Emily Blunt (despite being the best tanned Brit ever) more than holds her own; and the role allows Tom Cruise to do the two things he does best: incredible stunts and action sequences, and transform from cocky d-bag to dependable, highly competent icon. Without much thought, it's pretty easy to see the similarities to his characters in Top Gun, Jerry Maguire, A Few Good Men, and The Color of Money ... and of course, his recent outing in Oblivion. There is also a convenient excuse for Cruise to lose his battle helmet, an unnecessary segment of him riding his motorcycle, and of course, the patented Cruise sprint is on display.The movie itself begs for the obvious comparison to Groundhog Day and Source Code, with elements of Aliens, District 9, and The Matrix. Despite all the familiarity, this one kind of works thanks to the screenplay of Christopher McQuarrie (3 other Cruise movies) based on the 2004 novel from Hiroshi Sakurazaka entitled ""All You Need is Kill"". Why the Producers chose this generic, daytime soap opera type title over the source material title is beyond me.Cruise especially takes to the first half comedic moments, and that explains why the first half of the movie is much stronger than the second half. The phrase ""On your feet, Maggot"" takes on the the Sonny and Cher role from Groundhog Day, and to great effect. Supporting work from Noah Taylor, Brendan Gleeson, and (a scene chewing) Bill Paxton add sufficient distraction from the heavy action moments.So whether you enjoy special effects, intense action scenes, or just watching Tom Cruise get killed time and time again, you will probably find this one entertaining enough ... even though not much will stick with you a day later.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Edge of Tomorrow: Die Again, Restart, and It Becomes Ridiculously Fun","So, Tom Cruise is basically playing Call of Duty meets Groundhog Day. The guy dies, dies again, and keeps dying, but somehow, he makes it look cool every single time. It's like watching a Jedi stuck in combat armor who can't quite figure out how to beat the first tutorial level. Honestly, seeing Tom Cruise lost in an exo-suit is as satisfying as beating the first level of Dark Souls without getting one-shot.We're in a Groundhog Day-style apocalypse, where repetition becomes a treat. Every time Tom bites it, it's like restarting a game of Counter-Strike after a 12-year-old headshots you. But here, Cruise levels up, and watching him go from noob to killing machine is pure nectar. Doug Liman throws it at you like you're speedrunning the whole thing, and it's a total blast.Emily Blunt? Forget princesses-she's straight-up Ripley on steroids. She kicks ass with the elegance of Samus Aran after a caffeine binge. She's here to remind you that in this chaos of gooey aliens, it's not just Tom who knows how to play. She's the kind of character who makes you realize she can dismantle you and your fragile ego without breaking a sweat. Her nickname in the movie? Full Metal Bitch. Enough said.The Mimics, those aliens that look like a mash-up of Xenomorphs and Starcraft bosses, make you wish you were watching the first Alien all over again. They zip around, blow up everything in sight, and honestly, they bring a Starship Troopers level of adrenaline to every fight. Each battle has you sweating; there's no time to get bored with these creatures around. It's sci-fi mayhem at its finest.The film throws in jokes right in the middle of all the carnage, like someone added a humor DLC to an intergalactic war. Tom Cruise cracks lines that make you chuckle, even after the umpteenth time he gets blown to bits. It lightens the mood, and it feels like a mash-up of Edge of Tomorrow and Shaun of the Dead, but with more guns and aliens.Edge of Tomorrow is the most fun time loop since Bill Murray got stuck in his endless Groundhog Day. It's pure spectacle where you spend most of the time dying just to come back stronger and blow up more monsters. With a killer Tom Cruise performance and Emily Blunt as the warrior goddess we all needed, you'll be wanting more, just like Tom-ready to die, reset, and do it all over again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Actually enjoyable.,"First off, I have not been a fan of Tom Cruise for a while (though there were a few I liked). I did however enjoy this movie. It was sort of a mix of ID4 meets Groundhog day. It was actually enjoyable, even at the beginning when Cruise is playing his douche self. That said the pace of the movie really begins to pick up at about the 20-25 minute mark. It was interesting to watch the character develop (as if he really had a choice), the skills he needed to fight the summers alien enemy. There was a surprising amount of humor in the movie & it is easy to see where they could have made subtle changes to the script & just made it a lot darker, but they wisely remembered that it is supposed to be a fun summer alien movie & people don't really care for depression with their sci-fi.

"Live, Die, Repeat.",You can always count on Cruise or Blunt to give good performances but together they accomplished something fierce. It's a Groundhog Day premise but with sci-fi action and aliens. Basically Cruise gets unwillingly forced into combat by his superiors due to mass casualties. While on the battlefield he gets infused with alien blood and is able to continuously repeat his reluctant battle in hopes of finding a way to beat the aliens that have invaded our planet. The action was superb and there is no doubt that the casting choices were excellent specifically the late Bill Paxton.

"Fast-paced, engaging and exciting high-concept sci-fi actioner which is a superior summer blockbuster","Earth has been invaded and most of Europe has been taken over by a seemingly undefeatable alien foe. A small victory encourages an all- out assault on all front lines; into the middle of this is PR officer Major Cage – out of favor with a superior and finds himself dropped into boot camp as a deserter and forced onto the front line. Killed within minutes along with many others, Cage somehow finds himself walking up at the same point of the day before, stuck in a time loop which resets with each time he is killed. With every day giving him more knowledge and skill, Cage may be able to take the course of the battle.A very high concept idea doesn't always mean that things will work and it is worth acknowledging the good job that Edge of Tomorrow does in selling us the time-loop idea and throwing us into a world and scenario that is engaging. The idea seems to have its roots in video gaming since it is often the case when playing a game that one progresses through the level by gradually learning from mistakes and getting better at the skills you need. So it is with Cage and the film builds this idea very well at first. With very little background, we join a terrified Cage as he heads to certain death. This aspect is very well done as the battle sequence is brutal but also darkly comic. This rather dark streak continues as Cage makes tiny steps each time, with the repetition being exciting but also a little amusing.From here a plot starts to form, doing so from a point where the viewer is already engaged by the idea, the action and the effects. It does ultimately end up being less smart, edgy and brave than it seems, but by that point the film has done a lot to get us on board so we stay with it. The action sequences are really well done, and the effects are very impressive – even more so because generally I was caught up in the events rather than looking for the CGI work. Performances are surprisingly good; I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise but he is very good here. For the majority of the film he is not a hero or action-hero but rather an arrogant salesman (PR) and he lets us see his terror and confusion for the first half of the film – a key factor in drawing the viewer in. He does end up becoming a more traditional Cruise character, but he justifies getting there. Blunt is also good alongside him and is not just an attractive female sidekick. Support from Gleeson, Paxton, and those in J squad also helps build a convincing world and one that fits well the sci-fi genre without feeling like it is aping it.I watched this expecting it to be just a professional and expensive action movie and, while it of course is this, it is also a lot better than I expected. The use of humor, violence and action all help to make the concept work, drawing the viewer in really well so that when it does settle down to be more of what you expect, it still works because it already has you. A superior summer blockbuster.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Watch. Meh.

I enjoyed it so much, I felt like I didn't care if the end was going to come anytime soon. They could have made this film longer in my view, and it would have been just as good or maybe even better.I can honestly say that Edge of Tomorrow ranks up there with the very best sci-fi films since the turn of the century. I did see it in 3D, and I felt the 3D didn't really add anything great to the film, but that really seems to be the case with all the newer 3D films. The only film I've ever seen in which the 3D actually did add something extra special to the film, was Avatar. Personally I think the 3D fad can mostly be chalked up as another Hollywood gimmick that really does nothing at all, except add extra cost to tickets, and extra in their pockets of course. This film itself however is not a gimmick, it's solid action sci-fi that even does have some real thought provoking moments. The writing here is good, far better than most Hollywood action films. There is even a nod to Mr.Kubrick in the film. Do yourself a favor and check this out.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Terrific,"Tom Cruise may not get much respect these days but, for my money, he's one of the most consistent actors that delivers entertaining movies. I can't recall the last Cruise movie I disliked. This one's a fun, smart sci-fi action movie. Parts of it remind me of other movies like Groundhog Day and Starship Troopers but it never strays into rip-off territory. Cruise is in top form. You either like him or you don't. Nothing about his performance here is likely to change your mind about him. Emily Blunt is beautiful, which seems to be a point of contention for some who feel she's too attractive for the role. One wonders if these same people have ever said ""that guy's too good-looking to be a believable action hero."" Doubtful. Regardless, she's great in the movie and has good chemistry with Cruise. Bill Paxton has a supporting part but he's always fun. He pretty much steals every scene he has. The action and special effects are good, although the designs for the aliens are a little on the unimaginative side. It isn't a big dumb Michael Bay movie, which I appreciated. The ending of the film won't please everybody but I liked it. It's a summer blockbuster that doesn't assume its audience is full of morons.

Hoping for a sequel at some point because the story line can easily continue into something even more spectacular.

Time Loops and Alien Troops: 'Edge of Tomorrow' - A Dance of Death and Destiny,"""Edge of Tomorrow"" unfolds with a narrative dexterity as nimble as its armored protagonists. In this film, director Doug Liman has crafted a science fiction parable that is as much a nod to the video game generation as it is a reverent homage to the alien invasion classics of yesteryear. The film's temporal loops are executed with such precision that one might imagine the hands of a clockwork craftsman behind them, winding the gears of fate with a deft touch.Tom Cruise's Major William Cage is a man out of his depth, thrust into a war against an extraterrestrial threat known as Mimics. Cruise, with a career built on a certain brand of cocksure heroism, subverts expectations here. His Cage is initially a coward, a PR man in uniform, who finds himself in a nightmarish Groundhog Day, reliving the same brutal battle day after day. It's a role that allows Cruise to explore a character arc with more vulnerability than we're accustomed to seeing from him, and he does so with commendable aplomb.Emily Blunt's Rita Vrataski - the Angel of Verdun, or Full Metal Bitch, as the soldiers call her - is the film's revelation. Blunt, with a steely gaze and a physicality that's both graceful and lethal, embodies the warrior archetype with a freshness that avoids the pitfalls of genre cliché. Her chemistry with Cruise is electric, their partnership a dance of death and strategy that propels the narrative forward with relentless momentum.The action sequences are a ballet of bullets and alien appendages, choreographed with a clarity often absent in modern action cinema. Liman understands that the audience's thrill comes not from the mere spectacle of destruction, but from comprehending the spatial dynamics of the battlefield. Here, the camera serves as an ally to the viewer, not an adversary.Yet, for all its kinetic energy and visual panache, the film's third act succumbs to some of the bombast and narrative convenience that the earlier parts deftly avoid. The Mimics, as intriguing as they are as a foe, are somewhat underdeveloped, their motivations and origins relegated to the periphery of the story. This lack of depth in the antagonists robs the film of a richer thematic texture that could have elevated it from a good film to a great one.Moreover, the film's reliance on the time loop, while inventive, occasionally feels like a crutch. Certain sequences, though thrilling on the first pass, lose a measure of their luster upon repetition. The script, too, sometimes leans too heavily on expository dialogue, telling rather than showing us the stakes at hand.""Edge of Tomorrow"" stands as a testament to the enduring allure of the science fiction genre. It reminds us that within the framework of aliens and armageddon, there are still new stories to be told, new ways to thrill an audience, and new ground to break. It is a film that, despite its flaws, understands the heart of storytelling: that at the core of every tale worth telling is the transformation of its hero. And in this, Major William Cage's journey from cowardice to courage is a narrative well worth reliving, time and time again.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Wildly entertaining first two-thirds makes way for a generic climax,"Despite his questionable religious beliefs, cringe-worthy talk show appearances, and all-round general creepiness, one cannot deny the raw star power of Tom Cruise, even a shocking 28 years since his breakthrough in Top Gun (1986). Here, he brings charm to an instantly dislikeable character - a cowardly, smarmy PR major who hasn't seen a second of combat in a world battling invading alien forces. His performance - possibly one of the best in his long career - shows his true range as his character goes through a highly convincing arc from pathetic rookie to fully-fledged action hero. It's easy to forget that Cruise is a highly accomplished actor, and there is no-one better out there to spear-head a blockbuster.As humanity prepares for a surprise attack on an alien force called Mimics who have devastated many of the large cities on Earth, General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) orders public affairs officer Major William Cage (Cruise) to cove r the combat from the front lines during the assault. Objecting that his life will be placed in danger, Cage is arrested, labelled as a deserter, and wakes up handcuffed in the hands of Master Sergeant Farrell (Bill Paxton), a Southern drill instructor with a strange sense of humour. Cage is suited and booted with hi- tech armour and dropped into the battle, which turns out to be a disaster for the humans and they are overrun by the Mimics, who decimate their forces. Cage manages to kill a rare large Mimic, and is killed in return when the Mimic's acid-like blood dissolves his face.He then wakes up handcuffed, and again meets Master Sergeant Farrell, who appears to have never met him. The day plays out like it did before, and once again Cage is dropped into the battlefield only to be killed again, this time surviving a little longer. It's on the battlefield that he meets famous soldier Rita 'Full Metal B***h' Vrataski (Emily Blunt), who seems to recognise his ability to anticipate events and tells him to seek her out, before they are both killed again. Cage tracks her down on the base, and Rita informs him that he is stuck in a time-loop, something she experienced after a previous battle with the Mimics but has since lost due to a blood transfusion. The two start to work together, with Cage training to survive a little bit more every time he dies.Adapted from the Japanese light novel All You Need is Kill (a title the film adopted before it changed to the generic Edge of Tomorrow - something that may have been the cause for it's underwhelming box- office performance), the film clearly takes inspiration from video games. Every time your character dies, it starts again from the beginning of the level or checkpoint, where you can use your experience to gain the skill required to complete the level. While this can be frustrating and monotonous when bashing a game controller, Edge of Tomorrow doesn't linger on the repetitiveness of Cage's day, and instead moves the story along to the point where you don't even know how many times Cage has lived the same day.Each time, Cage learns to duck here, fire there, take a different route; and director Doug Liman revels in killing off his hero in a variety of ways to an often comedic effect. The first two-thirds of the movie are delightfully entertaining, with the Mimics proving to be inventive creations, resembling giant, tentacled tumbleweeds, and the movie wisely choosing not to get bogged down in time-loop mumbo- jumbo. Emily Blunt, one of the most charismatic and beautiful actresses working at the moment, is excellent, portraying a female lead who, for once, isn't there simply for the male hero to rescue and fall in love with, but is the key to any hopes of success. Which is all the more disappointing when the movie begins to bow to convention during the final third, as Vrataski starts to fall for our vertically- challenged protagonist.As with most recent blockbusters, Edge of Tomorrow also struggles at the climax. The inventiveness of the Groundhog Day approach (I almost made it through the entire review without mentioning the Bill Murray classic) makes way for a familiar, simplistic climax and a roll-your-eyes bittersweet final scene, It's sad, because this could have been one of the best blockbusters in the past couple of years; a twist on the usual crash-bang-wallop alien invasion flick. It does, however, offer plenty of great action, bolstered by a fine sense of humour, and proves that Tom Cruise can still convincingly anchor a big-budget action movie, even at the ripe old age of 52.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great concept, and proper execution","Edge of Tomorrow could easily have slipped into being another boring over-hyped sci-fi mess, but thankfully that is not the case. The core of its success is its strongly structured plot and meticulous production. The idea itself is a clever twist upon a beloved concept, but it would have meant nothing had it not being so carefully brought to life. First of all it has been simplified enough to allow time for the audience to enjoy the action without bothering too much about tiny crucial details, and this has directly contributed to a shorter than average runtime, which in turn makes it easier for the viewer not to lose interest and take in the entire plot.Diving into the ""technical"" parameters, the directing is smooth, with proper pacing and a top-notch revelation of the alien species. The cinematography is sturdy as well, featuring a remarkable use of natural sunlight. The visual effects are surprisingly subtle for the genre of the movie, just as much thanks to their photorealism as well as thanks to the main concept which literally makes the aliens look normal compared to what the characters are experiencing.Overall, more than pleased to watch a movie tiptoeing on the verge of being complete nonsense turn out to be a masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Less Rambo more Inception please,"The movie is actually not bad, however I made the mistake of going to watch it with too high expectations.This title adds a very interesting idea - ability to ""rewind"" time 24h back after you die - to the classic ""aliens invade Earth"" story. Tom Cruise is a high-rank officer in the United Defense Forces that gets demoted to a private, tagged as a deserter and is going to be dropped to the front on the next day. He then discovers that when he dies, time goes back a day and he can avoid the event that killed him.For some reason I expected a combination of ""let's fight the aliens"" with ""Inception""-type of action - that would have been very interesting, right? - but the movie is not at all in that direction. It starts very well and the first third gives enough of action and story development. Later on it just gets worse and worse. Many times I was just thinking ""get over with this scene please and lets move on to something more interesting"". This, in combination with ridiculous and completely inexplicable (even for the sci-fi movie standards) plot developments leading to a too cheesy ending were simply too much for me.This movie is for sure enjoyable - just make sure that your only expectation is to see some nice explosions.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Sci-Fi/Action Gem Lost in the Summer Shuffle of 2014,"I get the impression that EDGE OF TOMORROW is a film that most people will forget ever existed within a year of it's release. Despite being a big budget sci-fi action film with Tom Cruise in the lead, this movie went almost completely ignored by audiences. Including me. Unfortunately, I paid no attention to this movie during its theatrical run and contributed to its depressingly low box office haul. It's a high concept sci-fi action that's well written and populated with a strong cast; it should've done better than it did to encourage more interesting films out of the studios. Based on a Japanese novel (that I've never read), the story follows Major Cage (Cruise) in the midst of an alien invasion that has consumed Europe and threatens to soon spread across the rest of the globe. The aliens, dubbed Mimics, are an impossibly skilled species of killers that can seemingly predict humanity's every plan and prepare for it. Cage, an official with the military's public relations department, is assigned to be on the front line to record their invasion of Normandy for humanity's latest attempt, Operation: Downfall. Panicked, he tries to blackmail his way out and finds himself arrested and dropped on the front lines, no longer as a media specialist but as a deserter reassigned to an infantry unit. His first real taste of war ends as one would expect when he dies at the hands of one of the aliens' ""Alphas"" but not before introducing it to the business end of a claymore mine. He dies, covered in the Alpha's blood, and finds himself awakening moments later at the start of the day, reliving events. Cage is now on an endless loop of death on the frontlines and the only person who understands his plight is the ""Angel of Verdun"", a celebrated soldier named Rita (Emily Blunt) who has experienced the same phenomenon.Tom Cruise once again proves that, while I'm baffled by his personal life, he is a solid actor. His character, Major Cage, has a full arc over the course of the film as he transforms from a cowardly media relations specialist into a killing machine who is willing to selflessly sacrifice himself if needed to end the Mimics' invasion. Despite Cruise's history of playing the near-invincible action hero, he is totally believable in the beginning of the film when Cage is so terrified of seeing combat that he's willing to attempt blackmail on a general. His counterpart in the film is Rita, played in a surprising turn by Emily Blunt. I'm only familiar with Blunt from comedies so her role of a decorated military alien murder machine is mind-blowing in how well she does. Blunt has gravitas and you never question her character's ability to slaughter hordes of enemies on the front lines. Best of all, the filmmakers never bother to cram a love story between Cage and Rita into the plot as most summer big-budget action movies would be prone to do. Cage and Rita keep their relationship professional (mostly) and keep their focus on winning the war. In order to defeat the Mimics, they will need to locate and destroy their Omega, an organism that essentially acts as the central brain for the species. Cage's ability to restart the day each time he dies comes from a direct connection to the Omega, so he is now humanity's final hope in defeating the alien threat.I have never read the novel on which EDGE OF TOMORROW is adapted (""All You Need Is Kill"" by Hiroshi Sakurazakaand arguably a way cooler title) so I don't know who all deserves the credit for crafting such an awesome story structure, whether it be Sakurazaka, screenwriters McQuarrie and the Butterworths, or director Doug Liman. Cage dies a lot in this film, in fun and creative ways, and we're exposed to a lot of the same material over and over. But it never becomes repetitive or gets old. Each trip back through the day only shows what we need to see and advances the plot. It's a creative plot device that sets it apart from the usual linear storytelling and cookie- cutter plot structures the theaters are inundated with during the summer months. EDGE OF TOMORROW will do down as 2014's most under-appreciated movie, as audiences didn't exactly flock to see it and the hype machine died down real fast (despite critic's praises). I recommend this to anyone in the market for some blockbuster entertainment that isn't the same old grind. If I were to lobby any complaint against EDGE OF TOMORROW (aside from that horrible ""Live, Die, Repeat"" tagline that became the movie's unofficial second title), it would be the alien design. The Mimics are masses of writing tentacles and do little to impress or frighten. But that's a minor complain for a movie that is otherwise incredibly solid with terrific performances from Cruise and Blunt. If you haven't seen EDGE OF TOMORROW, go do so and see if you agree.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Groundhog Day meets Aliens,"I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but I have to give him props where they're due. He is good in this film.

But by the end of the movie, I'm almost dancing on the couch with him on Oprah.While admittedly I am a sucker for a time-travel film, still this movie has a lot going for it. It's intelligent, first of all, and doesn't assume you are half-watching while scrolling through social media (you probably should put the phone down for this film). There are small details you might miss if you aren't paying attention. It is fast-paced, and the scenes just before you gasp and jump back to the day before hit you in the gut.

There are just so many things we have to accept ""because of reasons"", that there is nothing left to follow from logic. I can buy aliens that for some reason stick to ground, and prefer hand to hand combat, rather than projectiles or explosives, but I cannot figure out why don't the humans use more appropriate military hardware. Did they forget what a tank is? And what of intelligence? I guess we don't need to know our enemy - we just throw more people with guns at them.

Winner of a flick.,"I believe it's one of Tom Cruise's under rated best flicks for story, for understanding a likely science fiction flick to watch.

And the unique way of battling an alien using its own powers against it's self.Tom Cruise's Style in storytelling is very good & fun, frustrating to say the least. Makes for a good watch & feel.

MUCH better than I expected,"I put off seeing ""Edge of Tomorrow"" for a long time, the main reason being that I am not exactly a fan of Tom Cruise. But after hearing one good report after another about the movie for a long time, I finally broke down and rented the Blu-ray. And I'm very glad that I did. This is one big budget sci-fi movie that's very well done for the most part. The basic plot isn't completely original - you'll see some small touches of ""Groundhog Day"" here and there - but it is handled with intelligence. The character played by Tom Cruise (who I must admit is good in this role) may be a coward (at first), but he's not stupid - he soon catches on to what's happening and does what you'd probably do in the same position. You'll probably guess what happens at the end before it actually happens, but all the same you won't feel your intelligence is insulted. As a bonus, the action sequences are also well handled, being very exciting while having the feeling things may not go according to anyone's plan. If I have a complaint about the movie, it's that some of the special effects - mainly the depiction of the aliens - don't quite convince, coming across as obvious CGI creations. But I'd rather have this movie than one that's ultra slick-looking but stupidly scripted.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Fun, if a little simple.","It was interesting to revisit this more than a decade later and come away feeling the exact same way. Edge of Tomorrow is a mostly good blockbuster that takes some risks and has a good deal of fun, but isn't quite strong enough for me to enter into ""oh my god it's so underrated"" territory.Like, I remember it not doing particularly well financially, even though everyone who saw it said it was at least good (it's a hard movie to flat-out dislike), but I also feel it falls a little short of greatness. I can't quite love it. I almost love the first two-thirds of it, maybe, but things fall apart and get kind of tedious in the final act. I don't know if ""Groundhog Day but with aliens"" approached this way is quite enough to sustain almost two hours' worth of movie.But also, Edge of Tomorrow is Groundhog Day but with aliens, and that's inherently fun. Timeloop movies are hard to resist, and when this thing's running full steam ahead, it's giddy and entertaining stuff. There's something inherently satisfying about the structure and repetition for at least most of its runtime, but a movie with this kind of premise is usually hard to wrap up in a truly strong way, and it's the wrapping up where Edge of Tomorrow makes me feel weirdly indifferent towards it, all of a sudden.But not different enough for me to turn on it. It's very good, and maybe even frustratingly close to great, and does more right than it does wrong in the end. So it's fun. Most of it still holds up. I just wish I could feel the level of passion towards it that some of its biggest champions do.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Plot well established, action well packed, but lack of emotion depth","Just watched an early screening last night, I was quite satisfied while my girlfriend wasn't so impressed.Here are the things in a nut shell1. Actions are top notch, nothing look a bit CGI generated (even aliens look fine), long shots are very convincing in 3D with good layer distances, but some of the close actions look a little bit too fast and hard to comprehend.2. The whole LIVE! DIE! REPEAT! thing is well established with unlikely humor, it really draw me into the shoes of Cage (not Nic Cage, it's Cruise's character), sometimes it is just too interesting to look at and you almost forget the big threat they are facing. Liman did a great job here to maintain audiences' interest without being ""repetitive"".3. Emotional development is somehow weak comparing to the action and plot. We know there is an alien invasion coming but we just ""know"" it, we don't ""feel"" it. Probably because we don't really know what Cage (Again, not Nic, nice try) cares about, we don't see him care about anything, except wining the war (maybe at some point we feel that he loves Rita, but it was not very well developed, things happened a little bit rush in emotional development).As a male audience, I wasn't stunned but still completely satisfied, maybe I just care about the plot and action more than the emotion (Just like Liman's first Bourne, emotional development was lacking while the plot and action are stunning). But as a female audience, my girlfriend may fell a little hard to feel for the characters, to care enough for the plot and action.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very good...,"""Edge of Tomorrow"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch a soldier living the same day over and over again while he has also to fight aliens. When he dies, he is revived and he starts again the same day from its start.I liked this movie because it combined very well the main concept of ""Groundhog Day"" with nice visual effects and its Sci-Fi touch. The direction which was made by Doug Liman, it was very good and he presented very well his main characters, something that made more clear their behaviors and their actions. The interpretations of both Emily Blunt who played as Rita and Tom Cruise who played as Cage were simply amazing and their combination worked equally good.

A fun and satisfying ride!  Cruise delivers!,"Formerly known as "" All You Need Is Kill"" (I get why they changed the name, but damn, I wish they would have kept it), Edge of Tomorrow could be loosely described as big-budget, sci-fi ""Groundhog Day"". Tom Cruise plays ""William Cage"", a soldier who's far from combat-ready, but winds up on the front lines of a major invasion against an alien force known as ""Mimics"". Cage doesn't last very long once the battle begins, but just as he's being finished off, he wakes up in the previous day. Now caught in a time loop that brings him back to that same point every time he dies, Cage has to use this strange ability to help win the war.Cruise crushes this role. No other way to look at it. You find yourself interested in Cage from the beginning, and become vested in Cage's unique growth through experience. He's funny, he nails the action scenes, and he brings some good weight to the emotional points. Emily Blunt Official also nails her role as the tough-as-nails soldier that teams up with Cage, and they work very well together.Although the story makes several departures from the original novel, make no mistake – this movie is entertaining. The action is intense without having too much shaky-cam, and the story has a great pace to it. You'd worry that a movie that's caught in a time loop would involve repeating the same scenes over and over, but they manage to keep repeating scenes fresh, or simply plow forward while implying that they've done this before. You'll never get bored.The visuals are GORGEOUS, and I'd fully recommend IMAX or 3D for this one. The beach battlefield scenes in particular are beautifully shot.For my money, this is the best Tom Cruise film of the last decade, for sure, and it feels like he took great enjoyment in making this one.

"""All you need is Kill"" L.N, by Hiroshi Sakurazaka","I went into this movie with low expectations. I hadn't read the synopsis or watched the trailer but I am a sucker for Science Fiction, good or bad, I like to watch it. About 15 minutes in I found myself in an odd situation, because what I was seeing on screen was good, more than good, entertaining. My curiosity was peaked and I genuinely wanted to know what was going on and what was going to happen next.When the loop began I didn't know this movie involved time travel so I started thinking, ""maybe it's a virtual training simulation? "", then I thought, ""no maybe he is stuck inside his head?"". It was fun not knowing, so I wish they hadn't given so much away in the trailers and synopsis.

"Pure popcorn entertainment. Love or hate Tom Cruise, there's something for everyone here","The Good: Whilst based from a Japanese graphic-novel, it's pretty original from a Hollywood perspective. The time-loop premise is handled well, it doesn't confuse the viewer and is used as a tool (not just a gimmick) to keep you engaged and the story moving. Tom Cruise also plays against type in this movie and he gets killed, a lot (not a spoiler, it's the movie's primary theme, central plot piece and was used to sell the movie). And of course, with Tom Cruise there are a lot of practical effects to, which always make action films and the cinematography pop.The Bad: Gets a little bit cliched at the end, with some leaps of logic required. Fortunately, it doesn't break the film. As it's just simple too good for the rest of its runtime. I wouldn't say it's a bad ending, just not a satisfactory resolution to the character arc.Should you watch it? Yes. Definitely. A shame that the marketing team did such a poor job of promoting the film, even the title does not do the film any favours - the movie definitely has the chops for mass appeal. There is nothing gratuitous in the movie. And you like it even if you love Tom Cruise (he's in the film giving it his all) or you find him annoying (he dies a lot and plays against his typecast) - you'll find something to enjoy in this movie.

Best World War II film that never was,"""Edge of Tomorrow"" has a whole lot going on. It's not just another scifi action flick, which is what I had thought and almost passed it by because of that. Instead, it's a very interesting mix of genres: scifi action (like ""Aliens""), World War II drama (like ""The Longest Day"") and comedy-philosophical mindbender (like ""Groundhog Day"").First the philosophical part. The premise is this: a less-than-honorable officer (Tom Cruise) gets shanghai'd and sent to the front lines in a war against an alien race. He bungles his mission almost immediately. But then an interesting thing happens: he gets sent back to do it again. And again. And again. I call this philosophical because you can immediately see the metaphor for reincarnation. And oddly enough, I got an interesting taste of existentialism here, too: Tom Cruise plays a character whose life has inherently no meaning. However it is through his determination and force of will that he finds an opportunity to try to make meaning for his life. Yes, it is a bit like ""Groundhog Day"" (where the main character similarly repeats a day over & over), but I stress the existentialist vibe in ""Edge"" vs. the more Buddhist vibe of ""Groundhog"" a film more about enlightenment rather than taking control of fate as we see here.Enough of that; I'll leave you to consider the deeper implications of this film after you see it. The next major point I really enjoyed about this film was the playful sense of humor. First of all, Tom Cruise doesn't play some hotshot soldier who can kill 1000s of enemies on a single magazine of bullets. Instead, he is introduced as something of a pretentious pencil-pusher, an idiot who doesn't even know how to unlock the safety on a firearm let alone fire it. So immediately his character has an added dimension and more room for a dynamic transformation. He's one of the most human soldier characters I've seen in a while. The film is peppered with timely bits of humor that keep things fresh. Director Doug Liman got his start doing comedy (""Getting In"", ""Swingers"", ""Go"") before he became known for action/thrillers like his ""Bourne"" films and ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" (which also have great spots of humor).And last, there's that bit I alluded to about World War II. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" plays out very much like a WWII flick, in particular a film about Normandy on D-Day. Thus, the action scenes are not some over-the-top cgi extravaganza in some surreal setting, but rather, they took great pains to recreate an authentic Normandy-type beach setting with tons of live props, explosions, stunts, and very sparing use of cgi effects. So if you're somewhat numbed by computerized visuals, have no fear, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a throwback to the old war flicks our parents grew up on. It does carry a modern, gritty feel to it. But it's still a very classic approach.When they do resort to computerized special effects, it's fabulous. The aliens that they're fighting are very creative and sinister, more like giant viruses than anything comic booky like Martians with helmets & ray guns. There's no point in describing the aliens, you just gotta see them for yourself.I also wanted to mention something I didn't notice until almost 45 minutes into the film, but there is an interesting LACK of profanity which makes this a pretty family-friendly flick. If you're like me, maybe you're tired of action flicks where characters drop the f-bomb every 10 words. Well here, we get tough, imposing, mean & dirty characters without them having to cuss like sailors to seem tough. Yes, this is PG-13, but it feels every bit as tense & heavy as an NC-17 or R film.Thumbs up from someone who rarely watches action flicks. If you end up liking this film, here are a few other gems worth tracking down: ""The Host"" - an action/comedy/satire monster flick about a sea monster attacking Korea (it is said that the sea monster is a metaphor for Western imperialism), ""Robocop"" the original 1987 version - a cynical, nightmarish look at the future with spots of great deadpan comedy, and ""Starship Troopers"" - a very satirical look at war and the mindless mob-mentality violence that often accompanies war, by the same director who did Robocop. It's always fun to find a heart-pounding action flick that has deeper meaning below the surface.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Tomorrow Never Dies,"Live, die, repeat. Or more appropriately: lather, rinse, repeat. So is the basic premise for Doug Liman's ""Edge of Tomorrow."" Not your average Tom Cruise vehicle, the film is built on the premise of a solider who, by some form of luck -- good or bad -- has attained the power to hit refresh on the same day. The catch is, he must die in order to do so. But in repeating the same day over and over again, he gains the edge over the Mimics -- robotic/insect aliens -- that have invaded his planet and eventually wins the trust (and, yes, affection) of his tough-as-nails partner, played by Emily Blunt.That's right, this is basically a sci-fi ""Groundhog Day"" with a video-game twist. Cruise's character re-spawns over and over again until he can learn from his mistakes and make progress. Naturally, this lends itself to a few humorous brushes with fate and a potential for fatigue as the audience is treated to the same action sequence over and over again for most of the first half of the film. No matter, though, as the film is never as dull as its limited premise would suggest. Liman, who directed the exceedingly entertaining and refreshing first ""Bourne Identity"" flick, is right at home with the material. The action is tempered with humor and flickers of humanity, with a surprisingly tolerable turn from Cruise, though Blunt is the real shining star of the movie. Stone- faced and focused, her character is the backbone and the heart of the movie, undercut only when the film sees fit to pull her into an unneeded romantic side-plot with Cruise (who is, incidentally, old enough to be her father). Elsewhere in the cast, we are treated to the always wonderful Bill Paxton as Cruise's increasingly befuddled sergeant. While he misses the perfect opportunity for a reprisal of his ""Game over, man, GAME OVER!"" line from ""Aliens,"" he is another bright-spot in the film. But then again, a little Paxton always went a long way in making any film better (R.I.P.).The film admittedly gets a little soggy in the final act, as the aforementioned romantic subplot is tacked on and the film strains to find a satisfying conclusion. The action ultimately becomes a bit of a blur, and the cinematography gets a little sloppy during the final face-off between Cruise and the Mimics. It doesn't completely undo the goodwill generated by the first half or so, but one can't help but sniff a little bit of last-minute studio-meddling and re- shooting here. Regardless, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a more than satisfactory and unique sci-fi film. Flawed, yes, but most assuredly a solid way to pass a rainy Sunday afternoon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I've watched this so many times,There aren't many films that I watch over again but I've seen this so many times now. I love the storyline and the concept of the film and the way they move it along is great. I also love Emily blunt who is particularly good as Rita. The concept really works and I should maybe mark it down for the ending which isn't as good as the rest of the film but I enjoy it so much that I'll let that go and still give it 10. Tom Cruise's character arc from bookish general to full warrior is fantastic. It will probably be a few months before I watch this again but I know that I will at some point - it's a fantastic movie.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A refreshing SciFi-Action,"This film is notable for being a refreshing change from the repetitive franchises that have dominated the Sci-fi/Action film space for the past few years (Disney's Star Wars, MCU,Film borrows themes from WW1/2 films, including a hardass Sgt, a paradrop and a beach scene. It leans heavily on inspiration from Starship Troopers (mechs & aliens), and it's source novel All You Need Is Kill.A good performance is given from Tom Cruise & Emily Blunt - Tom Cruise plays a character who is initially flawed and unlikeable. However his characters grit and determination eventually endear him to the audience, along with his charm/knack for convincing people of his ability to see the future. - Emily Blunt is given the role of a powerful heroine and does a good job portraying a woman who is trying not to become attached to her day-repeating comrade because she has experienced loss in a previous battle.Both leads battle their own fears of hopelessness in order to succeed.Romance between leads (the unnecessary kiss) was not convincing, it feels out of place given the context, Emily Blunt's characters experiences and the lack of romantic chemistry. It feels as though the studio took two very attractive leads and tried to force a sexual bond between them (cue 10 scenes of Emily Blunt's sweaty pushup), these characters would have been better as simply friends/comrades.A reasonable performance was given from the supporting cast despite limited (and very repeated) scene time. Particularly Brendan Gleeson and Jonas Armstrong. Although it was difficult to feel particularly attached to the supporting cast, even through self sacrificing moments, due to the lack of their development.Due to the nature of the film, there was a lot of scene skipping, and for the most part this was good as they kept the important 'death/learning' moment in and made compilation scenes. However sometimes due to scene / time skipping, I feel the audience missed out, a good example being a bonding conversation is eluded to between Cruise & Blunts characters. However the time skipping is done well at a later point as it allows for a dramatic 'how many times have we been here' moment.Arguably hipocritcally to the scene-skipping complaint, it could also be argued the some of the scenes that were not skipped were incredibly repetitive, however in my opinion the film balanced all of this relatively well.Unfortunately, the soundtrack should be a great part of a film like this, however it is barely noticable. Other than the soundtrack the general production and FX is very good.The film was also fairly short, and in my opinion, the ending could have been extended to allow for more audience satisfaction.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Tom Cruise surprises me,"I've Never really been much of a fan of Tom Cruise. I don't really know why exactly I've just never been a fan and when I first saw the trailers for Edge of Tomorrow I assumed it would be just another generic action movie. Now that I have seen this movie I am definitely ready to give Tom Cruise another chance because Edge of Tomorrow was actually really cool. Tom Cruise dies in a war against aliens and then wakes up the morning of the battle he dies in and starts all over. Emily Blunt is one of the only people that believes him and helps him understand whats happening. This movie is based off of a manga apparently but I'd never heard of it before this movie's release so I don't know if it follows its source material at all or not.Tom Cruise has definitely made some bad movies in the past but he is still a good actor. His and Emily blunts characters worked pretty well together both as a tag team in war and even as sort of a couple at some points. Watching Tom Hanks dying over and over again is pretty entertaining. It's kind of like that episode of Supernatural where Dean dies over and over again but not as funny and with a lot more sci-fi explosions. I'm definitely not a professional film critic by any stretch of the imagination. I don't know all the ins and outs of movies like someone who is more professional would but I think I can pretty safely say that the writing, directing, and editing are all pretty well done in this movie without sounding like an idiot. I'm also having kind of a hard time remembering all of the details of exactly what happened in the end because it is kind of up for interpretation which has been something that happens in some great movies. That sort of thing I personally think is a sign of good writing when done well. Obviously the ending is no where near as mind bending as movie's like The Shining but it was still pretty good.So overall even though the basic plot of Edge of Tomorrow has been done before this it is a pretty good example of it being done well. Edge of Tomorrow is a cool and entertaining science fiction movie.I'm giving Edge of Tomorrow an 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Easily the best performance of Tom Cruise ever,"This is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. It easily features the best performance Tom Cruise has ever given, perhaps because it offers him a chance to reprise every character he has played. We get to see action, romance, and obnoxious pretty boy behavior all rolled into one. I'm not kidding! TC fits like a glove into this character and the supporting cast (Emily Blunt!) is similarly entertaining. I don't rewatch many films but this is a keeper - well cast, well-directed and superbly edited. Seriously - this film features time loops so not being too repetitive is really important to keeping things rolling. And the editing team did a fantastic job here, even making things a bit comical by keeping it brisk. Very well done special effects which make the film highly watchable even as time goes by.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Edge of Tomorrow,"Edge of Tomorrow, is a solid action movie with a interesting but familiar plot device. Great acting combined with decent chemistry and a good story makes for a fun and interesting movie to keep enough of your attention.Directing, this is where the movie doesn't shine for me. Going the route of Saving Private Ryan with it's action scenes, which felt less than a homage and more just a bland copy. Combined with some of the worst shaky-cam I've seen in a while the action scenes were not where this movie was that enjoyable.What carries it is the solid acting and engaging story. The plot device we know, but it's still a fun part to go along with and it's solved creatively enough to be satisfying too. The story wraps up okay. The side characters are underdeveloped and felt somewhat weak. The two leads own it well though and make up the brunt of the movie. Music is fine, not memorable though. Alien design is pretty cool.Not much else, I didn't fall in love with it as much as others seem to do, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie, not at all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Starship Troopers and Groundhog Day had a baby,"In 2020 good sci-fi is hard to find so i looked back to 2014 and found this gem which is better than just about anything made in the last few years.This is an action packed alien invasion / time loop story which I very much enjoyed. The main characters are well acted as are the support, there is some intentional humour even during the brutal action sequences. I was worried the time loop narrative would get repetitive and boring but story moved along quickly enough to keep me interested

It was like a game where you try to advance to the next level every time you play.The visual effects are amazing and the action fast-paced.

Not what you think,"I was taken off guard by how enjoyable this is. Well executed and aided by a great script, here we have a stylish action with a bit of the good old Groundhog Day treatment.I usually find futuristic 'stuff-getting-blown-up-all-the-way-through' action movies tedious and a chore to sit through. Now don't get me wrong, there definitely IS stuff getting blown up all the way through here. But this is NOT just another lazy action popcorn flick. More than that, unlike so many other CGI-ridden modern action films (which encourage you to switch off your brain), this one actually makes you THINK.

The Best Tom Cruise Movie In a LOOOOONG Time,"I'm not really a big Tom Cruise fan. Haven't been since the first mission impossible. I think he's generally pretty mediocre. However this film is freaking great. Its the only film i know with the plot structure it has and its probably his greatest character growth yet, and it also fits the impossibly perfect sci-fi action that you see on blockbusters as of yet into a realistic scenario. This isn't the world where the action hero just conveniently missed that hurtling bit of debris from the nearby explosion because it was convenient to the plot. This is the world where he got hit in the face with that debris the last time around and woke up the morning before and knew to dodge that piece of debris the next time around. Its a really cool concept that they really pushed the limits of the sci fi action with and artistically it makes a great watch especially with those freaky aliens, the ""mimics"" which are definitely in my top 10 most creative and disturbing aliens, probably one of the most badass ones yet. Just the way that they fight and some of the choreography is so well envisioned, the FX department really did a good job on this one.In terms of character development it also does nicely. Major Cage is not even a good guy in the beginning, he's a total douche who pretty much bought his way into the position, and he's a giant coward. He's pretty much thrown under the bus by the military folk cause they see him for what he is and its only by sheer luck he gets caught in a time loop, but over the course of a film his fellow soldiers go from having him pegged as a spineless deserter to just reciting misinformed predictable assumptions about a completely different man then the man they expected. I think it subtly makes a good point about peoples reactions to someone they've never met, they don't stop treating him like the person he was even when he becomes that person, whether or not he's a hero was never something they could read on his face and it wasn't something anyone was ever going to know about him so it was more about an internal sense of fulfillment than recognition. Also stopping the alien apocalypse.Anyway, i give it a 10/10, i might've pushed more towards a 9.5 but i'm rounding up because of the fantastic concept and great execution.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"largely refreshing and clever science fiction thriller, verging on comedy in parts","What makes Edge of Tomorrow arguably the best Tom Cruise starring vehicle in the past ten years - yes, I'm going that far (excluding the Mission: Impossible movies I should add) - is context. For a while, Cruise has been playing characters who just come ready-made it seems as bad-asses; Jack Reacher, the character in Oblivion, Knight & Day (that was leaning more to comedy, but the point still stands), Valkyrie. In all of these, we don't get to see much at all in the way of a transformation into him being a ""bad-ass"", he just is, and it's gotten tiring after a while. Then enter in Edge of Tomorrow where he plays basically a PR man for the military - a talking head - in one of those apocalyptic societies where aliens have landed and there's a battle for Earth yada-yada. He gets tricked by Brendan Bleeson's General or Colonel or whoever, and is placed right into combat. Where he dies. Because he's not fit for war. But due to a kind of alien-substance-MacGuffin device, Cruise's character ends up going back to right when he's about to enter the combat hell. And this loop continues again, and again.What's different here? Cruise has to *become* a hero, and while this may not be something exactly new in action-sci-fi spectacle movies - certainly it's more along the lines of what you'd pick up in a screen writing class - it's refreshing for this star, especially to see Cruise have to act as the sap who is caught in a bad situation, and has little other choice but to get better (aside from, you know, the film's tagline of ""Live Die Repeat""). In another way what's so absorbing is that the structure of Liman's film, taking off from a Japanese comic book, is that it's like a video game: if you go into a combat zone, you have to progress (I was thinking of one of those Metal Gear games, but I'm sure there's something closer to what it actually is in video games). You have to get to that next level and keep going to get to the final ""bad guy"".The movie is short from being altogether great for the reason of the familiarity of the alien invasion dynamic - albeit the alien designs are rather extraordinary, with their spaghetti-limbs and quick pace - and the climax has more of that familiarity with what Cruise and Emily Blunt are going after to destroy that alien 'source'. But outside of that, Edge of Tomorrow is a winning picture, and the filmmakers have a lot of FUN with the premise and all of these times that Cruise has to go through this combat situation - also Bill Paxton as a scene-chewing sergeant with his platoon of metal-suited soldiers - and Blunt too. The team up works a bit better as well than some of the past Cruise vehicles (again, Reacher and Oblivion come to mind) as far as the two stars playing off each other, finding the dark comedy in these situations, and the gravity in the drama as well. When Blunt's character has to tell about how she went through this Groundhog's Day scenario before, there's weight and substance to the drama.I have to wonder if it'll work as well on another viewing; in the theater there was a real sense of surprise to every step of the movie's logic. I imagine it will be entertaining just by the nature of the writing, and it also must be said that Liman directs the action very well. There's some of the shaky-cam crap - he was the director of the first Bourne of course - but not TOO much, and you can tell what is going on in relation to the spaces shot to shot. It's all in all a case of a star taking it just a little bit easy, and it pays off: Cruise is really appealing in the film, as he goes on this adventure, learns as he goes along, and he and Blunt get great lines to play throughout. In other words, the kind of comedy-action-drama-spectacle that gets shoveled down the world's collective throat with Transformers, but much much better, for the reasons stated.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Absolutely Incredible!,"Lives up to expectations, Edge of Tomorrow is bold, brutal and a bloody good time with Tom Cruise as you've never seen him before. 2014 is shaping up to be a truly good year for film and this is a highlight, and also stands as Doug Liman's finest piece of work.When Earth is invaded by a vicious alien race known as the ""Mimics"", the coast of France becomes the front line. On that front line is Lt. Bill Cage, an inexperienced coward who is De-ranked and forced to fight, and dies within five minutes. Then, he wakes. Cage has been in contact with the blood of the Mimics, he has the ability to reset the day upon dying. He lives, he dies and he repeats the day, getting stronger and more skilled along the way, now it's up to Cage and the ultimate warrior Rita Vrataski to stop the invasion. Some of my favourite films feature time loop scenarios, from Source Code to Triangle, and now Edge Of Tomorrow is among them, reinvigorating the repeat narrative adding a fresh twist and style to it. The back-story behind the resetting the day is superbly explained, the amount of times Cage comes back never gets boring, just more and more exciting, this is a fully fleshed out story.I hate it when people say that they ""feel part of the film"", it gets annoying but I'm going to contradict that and say that I truly felt immersed into this movie, Edge Of Tomorrow's enormous and chaotic war scenes are so big and open, you feel like you're on the front line with Cage: Shocked, amazed and blown away. The build-up is tremendous, it sets up the anticipation and fear of going into battle, and when the drop ships rise into the sky and make their way to the beach you know you're in for a spectacle. The cinematography and camera-work is phenomenal, mostly consisting of wide shots and establishing shots, every angle of chaos is captured. The camera-work moves briskly, any moment the Mimics are going to hit, you are just waiting for something to go down and Doug Liman sets the action up with style. The explosions, the meteors, the gunfire, sand lifting up into the air, it's beautiful mess. Watching Tom Cruise run from a fireball in an Exo-Suit brought out the inner child in me, and when he dives into Rita, taking out two Mimics before the drop ships explodes left me gob-smacked. The action shots here are enough to make Michael Bay green with envy, and in 3D the experience is wholly enveloping and one of the best uses of the technology in a while.The special effects are something to behold and the use of them is in most scenes, but the cast don't fall behind, they ignite the screen. Tom Cruise is not playing a tough, cool guy, he brings a sense of isolation to the screen, he's out of his comfort zone completely and I loved his ignorance in the earlier scenes, he develops however but still remains rather reserved but one hell of a fighter, Cruise's performance is excellent. Emily Blunt is one big factor for me seeing this movie, God she's talented and in this latest adventure, a total bad-ass. She plays Rita Vrataski, the poster girl for the war, but behind the hero is a emotionally cut off woman, watch her in other movies and you can see how extensive her range is. She looks ferocious in an robotic suit, and watching Blunt fight with a modified helicopter blade brought me joy! If anything, a cast has never looked so good before, the suits are the coolest and best designed pieces of kit I've seen in a film, and the turmoil the cast went through wearing these chunky suits is worth it, they look like proper fighters.This is a proper blockbuster, filled with mind blowing special effects, jaw dropping 3D effects, tremendous storytelling and a whopper of a cast who really perform at their A- Game. Tom Cruise is a movie star that remains eminently watchable, as is Emily Blunt who continues to amaze, these two are a dream team, and Director Doug Liman utilises his big budget to perfection.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Surprisingly he awakes in the Heathrow Base and relives the same day over and over after dieing. Each time, Cage tries to fix the deaths of his squad and he meets Sergeant Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) that asks him to find her when he awakes in the base. Rita brings Cage to meet Dr. Carter (Noah Taylor) that explains to him that he killed an Alfa and his blood has given the ability to reset time. Further, the last hope of Earth is the destruction of the Mimic leader called Omega that is hidden.

With added humour, fine story telling and a ripped Emily Blunt kicking alien behinds, it was impossible to keep my eyes off the screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Live. Watch Edge of Tomorrow. Enjoy this Gem. Repeat,"I am Writing this review after watching this Critically and Commercially successful film(for the 9th or 10th time I guess).
Action packed and intense film filled with amazing story, wonderful visuals, superb direction, great screenplay and undoubtedly absolutely great Performances of Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt.
Tom & Emily is Iconic duo which i would love to see together again( Sequel is in development as per Jan 2021).
Looking back at this film after 7 years of its release, I can say this for sure that this film Deserves more praise & should had done more business in its theatrical run. It should had been nominated for awards. Tom & Emily both gave brilliant performances, the film was absolutely fantastic, Screenplay and Visuals were over the mark. Doug Liman really showed his direction skils.
Edge of Tomorrow was Award worthy in every way. It was snubbed off the awards, so were Tom & Emily.
Hope its sequel would be as Good as The First one or even better. This time it should get the recognition from the Academy and should prove to be a Blockbuster.
This film will always be in my Top Films List and Tom Cruise & Emily Blunt will always be one of my Top Stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good film,"Enjoyed the storylineI'm sure others have said this, but this movie is essentially Groundhog Day meets Saving Private Ryan, only with the doodads from The Matrix instead of Nazis. Which doesn't make it bad. There is considerable entertainment to be had from seeing Cage (Tom Cruise) trying to worm his way out of being sent into combat, his sheer funk on his way in, and the repetition of his deaths, some of which are very funny. The special effects are astonishing, and the film is entertaining throughout.If I was to be critical of it, I would say that it is a big flashy movie of little consequence other than immediate entertainment value, but that could as easily be an endorsement as a criticism. It is one of those films which, when it pops up on TV, you'll almost certainly sit down and watch it. Get out the popcorn and enjoy!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Groundhog D-Day,"For a film so on-the-nose featuring a modern day Normandy Invasion against MATRIX-like robot squid aliens who have taken over central Europe, this film works surprisingly well due to its fun hard scifi premise of reliving a time period over and over again until getting things ""right"". It's basically a send-up of the strange reality of video games, where the key to winning is not so much based on skill, but on memorization after hours and hours of trial and error. Ever seen an amazing speed-run of Super Mario or Battletoads online and wondered what it took to get there? This movie answers your questions, depicting it with a semi-plausible real-world scenario.The editor for the film certainly gave life to a concept that could easily become tiring. In fact, I would say this has to be one of the better-edited films I've seen in years. Things move along briskly and snappily and it was difficult to look away up until the climax of the film which unfortunately gets a little formulaic and stretchy to make things ultimately satisfying.Emily Blunt feels miscast as some battle-hardened veteran with perfect makeup, hair, and nary a scar from all her hand-to-hand combat. Sure the film would have been more realistic to have someone like Sam Elliot in her part as a shepherding mentor character, but wouldn't have the eye candy, and let's not kid ourselves there.Cruise does a good job playing a fish-out-of-water everyman type hero, but he's starting to get a little old to play this sort of character believably in such an action-heavy film. Action-wise, there are plenty of amazing stunts largely buried under a heavy torrent of VFX and CGI but thankfully not as obnoxiously as we've come to expect in films such as this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a joyride!,"I watched the movie twice - first while in a flight to Singapore alone.

Edge of Tomorrow manages to keep you on the edge of your seat,"I personally love films and stories about time travel, when a film manages to explain its feasibility reasonably enough then it makes for great viewing. Edge of Tomorrow is a unique time travel story that takes place during a modern war where mankind fights an unknown and alien enemy.Tom Cruise is in top form once again as he plays a general who has the ability to relive the day after he dies. His ability is the same as the foreign entity that has the same power. He is assisted by decorated soldier Emily Blunt who once had the same power. Not only does he try and kill the source of the enemy's power but he also tries to save Emily Blunt in the process. The action and special effects are a thrill to watch. Even though the day repeats itself you never get bored because each repeated day is more interesting and action filled than the last.Definitely recommended.

OMG this is crazy,"This is the first time i'm writing a review because i was so happy leaving the theater. The movie has it all.

This movie is way better than that (i'm sorry) peace of crap. I will not try to spoil anything but OMG the movie is so surprising and can't stop thinking about it.

She is Ellen Ripley, Lorraine Broughton, Andy (Old Guard), Furiosa, Sara Conner, The Bride, Coffey / Foxy Brown, Riley North, Cataleya / Neytire, Maeve, Mallory Kane, all the women in Sin City, and Lara Croft / Salt.Collateral, (he and Jamie Foxx should have received awards), and Edge are my all time favorite Cruise movies. Emily Blunt is just so believable and a strong presence in this Groundhog Day vs. Aliens Cruise movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not quite perfect, but darn close.","The dialogue, direction and editing often leave something to be desired, as do a few of the supporting players. One in particular seems to think he's in a different movie. And the ending, while fitting and satisfying, could have benefited from better lighting. Most of these problems stem from inexperience rather than incompetence, and forgiveness is easy. Next time will be even better, right?That aside, Edge of Tomorrow is by far the best ""blockbuster"" movie since the heyday of Spielberg. It is intelligent, clever, exciting and fascinating. This movie seems determined to treat its audience with respect, something that doesn't go unnoticed and unappreciated.Cast-wise, the 50-something Tom Cruise amazes as the still utterly believable coward-turned-action man, Major Bill Cage. Emily Blunt's bitter war hero, Sergeant Rita Vrataski is simply superb. Brendan Gleeson's weary-but-determined General Brigham is unnerving yet sympathetic, and Bill Paxton's Master Sergeant Farell is a real hoot.Cruise and Blunt realistically portray characters who are (and have become) tough and heroic only as a result of long and bitter experience. Anti-superheroes, you could say. The transformation of Cruise's Cage is particularly well-handled, but Blunt's Vrataski is his equal in every way.They are all clearly having a lot of fun with the opportunity to constantly tweak the same lines, even when much of that dialogue ought to be better.The production and art design does an marvelous job of evoking a genuinely anxious and desperate war time vibe, one too rarely seen and felt in modern cinema. All the London of this movie needs is a bit of Vera Lynn and some portraits of Winston Churchill for completeness.It may be that this very obvious non-American focus is the reason Edge of Tomorrow failed to catch alight in the US market. Cruise is the sole American lead, and he spends much of the movie as a gibbering coward, confused and bewildered, while an international army laughs. This is not Captain America.On the other hand, it could be just that this movie was lost in the usual seasonal deluge of big, loud, and mind-numbingly stupid blockbusters.Whatever the reason, it's a shame, because Edge of Tomorrow is a genuine classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Light hearted sci fi actioner,"What if Groundhog Day was set during a war and dying caused the reset? This is the basic premise of Edge of Tomorrow, which sees Tom Cruise's William Cole being hurled to the frontline of a war against aliens that he wants no part of. Thing is, after an incident on the battlefield he is set to repeat the day over and over again, and over time he gradually learns how to be the soldier the battle needs.I liked EoT. It doesn't take itself too seriously, with Cole becoming victim to some amusing deaths as he learns the day. The Aliens look menacing enough, despite just being a mess of metallic tentacles, and seeing how Cole uses the repeating day to enhance his skills and learn the battle is intreguing. The action is solid and for the most part is well shot, although the final act seems to introduce a tone change, with quick cutaways and excessive darkness that make it difficult to see what's happening. Overall a great watch, but its probsbly not going to get into anyones top films of all time list.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers,"This movie is slick and watchable but hardly original. The parallel to Groundhog Day makes it all faintly ludicrous, the battles (and the aliens) are straight out of Starship Troopers, and there's a dash of 12 Monkeys time travel thrown in. I'm still looking for the smart that some reviewers see. Summer action thriller, late-night TV fodder -- it's found its niche.Tom Cruise keeps at it, more power to him, and Emily Blunt proves herself surprisingly versatile. Brendan Gleeson always good, but he has a chump's role here. Bill Paxton proves that the less time he is on the screen, the better he does. Ultimately, this a low budget film with big time special effects. There's something cheesy about the set in the climactic scene. Film seems way overrated at 8.0.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Watch this Will Smith,"The story has been written a couple of times on here, I won't repeat it again ... Pun intended. But aside from that(which kind of redefines ""repeated"" viewing a bit), the movie is actually pretty good. While the initial pushing into the whole mess story, is a bit stretched, it does work out and make sort of sense.Plus you have two great actors who are game to go all the way. Emily and Tom are a great pair and the chemistry is obvious on screen. Everything they do makes sense and the script really does treat the viewer as if he/she are intelligent human beings. Which is nice for a change (in Hollywood Land). The end (or third act or whatever you want to call it), might seem a bit stretched, especially considering what has been done before, but after all you won't mind too much and be just thrilled and enjoy the ride",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
On the Edge of Science-Fiction,"It is usual to see Tom Cruise in the skin of such characters, sometimes too often, yet this time is not regrettable.Indeed, if the film works, it is thanks to the writing of the film and its directing. Doug Liman has managed to increase the efficiency of a well-crafted script, in a first very well put, exciting and surprising hour and half.Although we could figure out some bad points, for instance the extraterrestrial aspect of the movie (about the CGI, the origins, the story, etc), or the last thirty minutes of the films which tends to be much more closer to the classic narrative of the others summer blockbusters and focused on the ""Tom Cruise's heroism"", Edge Of Tomorrow remains a very nice surprise and an entertaining moment you'll enjoy to live, and to repeat.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Great story for sci-fi lovers,"With both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt I was fairly certain I would like the movie, but I actually loved it. The story keeps you guessing what is going to happen next - but I won't get into the details and ruin any of the many surprises.Cruise and Blunt play their unusual characters very well, but we also have a great supporting cast including Brendan Gleeson and Bill Paxton and many lesser-known actors all delivering their lines well.We saw the 3-D version because of the convenience of the start time, although I have never been a fan of 3-D. I'm fairly confident that the 2-D version would be just as entertaining because it's such a cool story. But the 3-D was enjoyable and helped the movie a bit - I think because it was not really an in-your-face 3-D despite this movie having a lot of action scenes.Yes, it is a futuristic doomsday scenario (are you getting tired of them?), but this one is different and I found a lot of laugh-out-loud humor in it.I highly recommend it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Great entertainment in this Tom Cruise sci-fi,"Tom Cruise is the biggest movie star on planet Earth for a reason- he makes movies like Edge of Tomorrow. Great concept, fantastic execution and a great two hours of entertainment. Edge of Tomorrow is Groundhog Day in a science fiction setting- to a beat. But that shouldn't discourage the viewer from thinking this will be a predictable film. The humor element plays a great part and adds to the zing of the action scenes. Acting, as expected is good with Cruise doing what he does so well- run, jump, smile, kick, punch. Emily Blunt is a great actress and brings a freshness to the role of the lead female. The special effects aren't heavy, but they are used well and assist the story instead of the other way around. Doug Liman is an exciting director and boy does he bring his best to Edge of Tomorrow. If you like action or sci-fi movies than this is a must watch.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great deal like a video game,"While you maybe can't quite call this one original, it WAS different. It is clearly evocative of ""Groundhog Day' and ""Star Trek"" among others. It is also a great deal like a video game, where you get killed and have to start at the first level again over and over. The movie was very skilled in setting that tone, and then letting it go, just being understood, before that got boring. And, interestingly, it went the other way, too, where it became clear that Cage had been further into it than we have. There is plenty to mock about Tom Cruise, his diminutive stature, his loopy religion, etc., but he clearly has that ""it"" factor that makes him a movie star, and he is always easy to watch on-screen. I was quite impressed with Emily Blunt with whom I am unfamiliar.If you like the science-fiction genre, you'll have to check this out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Groundhog Day meets Aliens,"I usually think sci-fi movies have too many plot holes, and this one has some, but for the most part it makes sense. Of course, they are using the plot of groundhog day set in an alien invasion. One big plot hole is why didn't Rita leave herself notes so she wouldn't have to repeatedly meet Cage over and over. And the whole part where she and the scientist dude figured out some aliens are Alpha protecting an entity called Omega, was very far fetching. But anyway it was cool to see how Cage improved day to day to get further on the battlefield. Considering we are talking about invading aliens, why did others, like the general, find it so hard to believe Cage and Rita about time travel.Anyway, it ended how it should with Cage waking up again except this time, things are different.FINAL VERDICT: Pretty good sci-fi with cool special effects.

A Feel Good Movie,"""Edge of Tomorrow"" was a very well done action movie, that played things safe as far as generic action and sci-fi go. In doing so, it did a very good job and even added a few new things to the genre.This movie bears a strong resemblance to Groundhog day, and has a lot of good humor in it along with great action sequences and effects. Interestingly enough, this movie also slightly resembles the movie ""The Notebook."" One will likely not come to this conclusion until after finishing the movie, though.While everything was done very well, one can not help be annoyed with the background premise of the movie, as it is pretty well one huge multiplying plot hole. With sci-fi movies, it is a requirement that one lets down there logical mind to an extent in order to enjoy the fictional story being told, but with this movie in particular, one cannot help but become lost in what exactly the implications truly are of all the happenings on the screen.Just focusing on the movie, and enjoying it without putting a great deal into the ""reality"" of what is coming to pass, one will get a movie that awakens emotions of romance and what it is to be human, all the while, being wildly entertained with seamless action sequences and witty humor.A very enjoyable, feel good movie.

One of the best adaptions of a Japanese manga!,"This was a first time watch for me and I was excited to see it. After watching this movie, I can say that I'm baffled that this movie bombed back in 2014 because this movie was phenomenal.Positives for Edge of Tomorrow (2014):
This was an awesome action movie version of Groundhog Day (1993). The action sequences in the movie are handled very well which you can always expect from director Doug Liman. The performances from the cast were awesome. This is a very different role and performance for Tom Cruise where his character of Major William Cage starts off as a courage at the beginning of the movie and by the end of the movie, he becomes the badass that we all know and love about Cruise. I also really enjoyed Bill Paxton as Master Sergeant Farell even though he doesn't have a lot of screentime but he manages to make the most of his time on screen. And of course, Emily Blunt is awesome as Sergeant Rita Vrataski and it's another prime example of doing the strong female character in modern day movies. In the beginning of the movie, she starts off as this harden tough female individual that you see in a lot of these modern day movies and tv shows, but unlike some of those projects, this movie actually gives her character development. Throughout the movie, whenever William Cage loops back in time before the day of the invasion, Vrataski starts to show off a more human and vulnerable side to herself that makes the auidence connect to the character more. In a time now where Hollywood is desperately trying to create new strong female characters for a modern day auidence, it's nice to see a movie where the filmmakers take this time and effort to make us like the strong female character. The dynamic between Cruise and Blunt is the heartbeat of the movie and without them, this movie would not work. And finally, it was nice to see filmmakers actually putting the time and effort to making a good adaptation of a Japanese Manga Series.Mixed for Edge of Tomorrow (2014):
Because the movie uses the Groundhog Day Time Loop element, you know how the movie is going to play out by the end of the movie. Also, it pains me that this movie bombed in the box office because we might never get a follow-up to this movie and this could've been had Warner Bros. Decided what the title of the movie was going to be, but unfortunately this is one of those times where Hollywood decides to screw over the movie potential success.Overall, Edge of Tomorrow (2014) is hands down the best movie that Doug Liman has ever directed and one of the best live-action anime adaptations of all time.

Within thirty seconds from the start, we are already being told about the major catastrophe. Then, the cycle happens quickly and repeatedly, yet the repetitive cycle does not feel cumbersome because of great editing. Every time it repeats, it tells less of the previous parts and adds a little more information.

Europe has developed recently developed an armor type suit that has proved effective. Cage's meeting with General Birgham goes sour and while attempting to resist arrest Cage is knocked out. Upon waking up he finds himself stripped of all identification and credentials, now placed in the military effort framed as a deserter. Despite his attempt to explain his situation he is geared up and sent off to the front lines to fight the alien insurgence. He is air dropped in a futuristic invasion of Normandy like beach advance. During what is a very violent and merciless slaughter of human troops Cage manages to kill one of the larger aliens. When covered in the alien's blood it inadvertently transfers its special time manipulating powers over to him. So now when killed, his day is reset back to his first moment from when he comes through as an infantry recruit having been stripped of all his identification. After several runs of the same day over and over again, Cage meets up with the military's star solider Rita played by Emily Blunt. Cage finds out that part of her success as a solider stems from the fact that she too had once experienced the same phenomena. Together they attempt to use Cage's power of time rest to unravel the enemy alien inner workings and save the world. This is a great new Tom Cruise classic. Its Star Ship Troopers (1997) meets Groundhog Day (1993), in an edge of your seat non-stop fun, sci-fi adventure. Tom Cruise has totally redeemed for his recent lack luster box office offerings. Emily Blunt adds herself to the ranks of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley and Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor. Not often do strong female roles come along in films like this and she nails it; tough, strong willed and ready to kick ass. A much better role model for young girls who envy Disney princesses, who wait for their prince to come save the day. This movie is a refreshing alternative to todays, comic book, teen novel, sequels and reboots that seem to dominate the box office. I am not sure how well this movie would function as a sequel and quite honestly it doesn't matter. We can do without its mediocre sequel, this film by itself is awesome high octane action.

Amazing SF action,"A combination of SF and Groundhog day. It's a great combination. A film with very few flaws, and it gives us viewers a lot. It's not repetitive because it breaks down with a little comedy. It is not boring because it has a lot of quality action. The two main roles are at a high level. Even on re-watching the film remains fresh and interesting. Maybe the ending could have been a little smarter and longer, so to speak.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Well filmed,"Most moviegoers know that all Tom Cruise roles are the same. Despite this, this film has the special charm of offering us a welcome catharsis. In this case, Tom Cruise, due to those things of fate, has a certain ability that is key to the salvation of humanity, but nobody believes him. This in turn goes hand in hand with a bit of sitcom, a bit of drama, a bit of romance, monsters everywhere, and an ending that offers the answer to the most important question: What is the reason for the presence? Of Cruise in war zone? The movie is well shot with convincing performances where Bill Paxton especially stands out. The fact that the only delicious action in the film is repeated so many times makes us think that this should be repeated more often.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not Impressed,"I'm honestly not sure how this film has had such good reviews. I found many issues with it and I wanted my money back by the end.First off, the characters aren't likable. At all. Every character had a lack of emotion that is essential for audiences to enjoy watching them. Cage was annoying and Rita just seemed angry. They didn't seem like actual people.Second off, there is almost no explanation of what is going on. The mystery that I think they are going for is taken too far. It took way too long for them to even show what a ""mimic"" is, let alone explain ANYTHING about it. There is almost no back story for any of the characters and I, as a viewer, found this very frustrating.Thirdly, the humor wasn't funny. I think that they tried to make Tom Cruise's character somewhat likable with a few jokes here and there but they really weren't successful. They were misplaced and tasteless. I really didn't find the one guy fighting naked very funny. Come on.Most importantly, IT WAS SOOOOOOOO REPETITIOUS!!! I understand that he kept going back in time and it would have been a decent story line had I not been forced to watch the same scene over and over again. The first few times it repeated I thought it was okay, but I don't need to see Tom Cruise get yelled at repeatedly or fight machinery and fail repeatedly. It was supposed to further the storyline in a unique way, but instead made me very annoyed. The repetition made a story that had potential to be interesting, be incredibly boring.The redeeming quality is that Tom Cruise did okay with what he was given. It just wasn't enough to win me over.Ultimately, this film is not worth sitting through. It is slow, uninteresting and unlikable. No thank you.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

BEST Time-Travel Action Movie Ever!!!,"Its definitely one of the BEST SCIFY films out there!!The plot, the cinematography, filmography, CGI, and the details were on point.. The casting was perfect with Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt on the front, plus the chemistry we're amazing...They didn't go over the top with the edits, the story line was good, and the twists we're cool and somehow unexpectedly expected..What sets it apart from other time-travel movies was that it gets full circle (it actually presents a descent beginning and an ""ending"" that can be considered as such or beginning for a sequel), the time-travel mystery was not too much and just enough to give ""proper"" explanation, they stayed with the main plot which is not overly complicated, and the side plots actually sustains the main one and not overshadow it..Simply put, they didn't overly complicate things or added way too much elements; they did it just right, a perfect formula that should be used by other movies as well.It was a great combination of scifi and action; with the scifi detailed and mysterious enough not to warrant that many loopholes and added with awesome action scenes that makes the PERFECT ENTERTAINMENT...If you prefer action or scifi or a little of both or even it you're just looking for well made film, this one's perfect!!P.s It doesn't even alienate anybody, well except maybe age but - it's for all gender.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I don't tire of this one...,"As Hollywood ""vehicle movies"" go - Edge of Tomorrow (Live, Die, Repeat) is probably one of the best. It's been in my BluRay collection for some time now: just scrapes into the 9/10 band.The story is good. The only weakness is that it stretches the limits of Sci-fi in certain places. No spoilers, but it's sort of Groundhog Day meets a kind of battelefield armageddon!The action is good - with a stack of CGI - that doesn't actually choke the spectacle.Ok, it's a vehicle for Blunt - who is excellent, and Cruise - who gives his normal reliable performance. Extras such as Glesson, and Bill Paxton (in his dotage), also very good. Believable dialogue. Good sci-fi imagery. It's fairly relentless, but there is rise and fall.There's just a bit more in Edge of Tomorrow than blam blam blam blam blam. We see this in some of the situations, but especially at the very final scene.I like this film. The sign of a good film is that I don't tire of it. And I don't tire of this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A video game come to life,"With the promotional poster setting the tagline in far bigger typeset than the actual title of the film, it's no wonder many audience members showed up at the theaters asking for tickets to Live Die Repeat instead of Edge of Tomorrow. And with a tagline so direct, I doubt there was anyone who went into the movie not knowing the main plot. Since Tom Cruise's ""first life"" lasts the first twenty-four minutes of the movie, it's a true testament to his fan base that no one thought the plot was slow to start. Everyone who loves him will be right there experiencing his confusion, frustration, and courage as he accepts his strange fate.If you're watching the movie for Emily Blunt, she definitely takes second fiddle to her leading man. She's a tough soldier who winds up training Tom for active duty - which brings us to one of the flaws of the movie. It's not his fault, but sometimes actors become such megastars, they're incapable of disappearing into an everyman part. So, when Tom acts incompetent and doesn't know how to take the safety off his weapon, telling everyone around him he's ill-equipped to participate in the action, it's not really believable. Thankfully, we know Emily will be successful in turning him into an action star, so we can chuckle and move on.Special effects fans will be very pleased, since the villains in the movie are aliens. Not only is it a war movie, but the soldiers fight in ""magical"" metal uniforms, and the aliens swirl around the screen faster than you can see them. The uniforms really aren't that great, since they run out of battery power in less than 24 hours, ammunition is quite limited, and they're bulky and heavy. But again, we can chuckle and move on. It's a Tom Cruise action movie, and no one wants to criticize the plot, right? So, don't try to out-think the screenwriter (like I tried to do); just sit back and enjoy a ""video game"" come to life.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. In every scene, there are swirling, swooping, or spinning camera movements, and that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Tom does it again.,"I never run to see any Cruise movie, but decided to give this a chance after enjoying The Mummy. I actually liked this better.

I you want a great double Tom Cruise double feature, pair this with The Mummy, sit back and prepare to be entertained.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not a science fiction film,"Had big expectations for Edge of Tomorrow, but at its heart is just another dumb, loud, alien invasion summer crash grab. There are some very light science fiction elements such as the mechanized suits and Cruise's special power that reset time upon death. There is no intelligence or motive given behind the aliens invasion, and not even a generic explanation of how time and space might warp space and time to allow it to happen.Cruise and Blunt put in solid performances. Blunt is stoic and plays an awesome soldier. Cruise is a little more erratic, flashing his million dollar smile a little too liberally given the situation. There are no other real noteworthy characters in this film. One of the problems I had was just when Cruise and Blunt were developing some on screen chemistry, the ""gimmick"" kicked in meaning Cruise meant an unfortunate demise resetting everything.The film works as a generic action summer outing. It will never be remembered as a science fiction great. I probably enjoyed Oblivion more. Even though its not original and becomes convoluted , the first hour alone of Oblivion is more thought provoking and entertaining than Edge ever is.

Go see it while you still can,"Sometimes you just know which films aren't going to make their money back. Edge of Tomorrow is one of these films. Not because I thought it was going to be bad but because it is a high concept scifi film and audiences rarely connect to these kinds of films. The trailer didn't show much (apparently audiences hate that or find it confusing or they assume the whole movie is like that) but you can't give it all away, they already gave away too much. Idealy you should go see these films without any advance knowledge. Edge of Tomorrow is based on a Japanese graphic novel 'All you need is kill' (that was also going to be the original title of the film - a better one I think) and in essence is a combination of Groundhog day and Starship Troopers. The exoskeleton suits are actually very similar to the suits from the Starship Troopers book but weren't used in the 1997 film because it was too expensive. The time-loop concept is responsible for some great comedy (cfr Groundhog Day) and Cruise was certainly a perfect cast here. The film is very focused on the purpose of the time loop (that is what the film is about innit) but that doesn't always leave much room for sidetracking. That results in a very fast paced but incredibly well made film. The VFX are state of the art and there is plenty of action. I can highly recommend this film. It was very risky to make a 178m$ groundhog day film which unfortunately will fail at the box-office because audiences besides scifi aficionados aren't ready for it. If you want to see it in the theater (which I recommend) you'd better hurry coz it won't play long.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I try to imagine the IQ of the target audience. I can't.,"So Cruise is getting older, yet year after year CGI shows him more agile than Jean Claude Van Damme in his good days. Yet this movie's script is very particular.Cruise is shown as a deserter impersonating an officer, now a prisoner.1. The prisoner is delivered nice and easy and left to sleep on a pile of luggage.
2. The prisoner is delivered in full officer uniform, minus the trinkets and ornaments.
3. He is a new recruit, so he is going in action.
4. He is unreliable so he must be part of a dangerous mission.
5. Although a mission is prepared and everybody is busy, there is not one, but three NCOs to introduce him to his new life. One that notices that Cruise has just woken up from his slumber, a second that takes over later on and has some papers on Cruise too and a third one right behind to carry the effects of the prisoner.And this is the good part. Later the script starts making less sense and from all the dialogue the overall idea is something about bow down to your governmental overlords as you alone can't take care of yourself.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Groundhog Day - the SF action version,"Despite the title, this is not a soap opera. Imagine ""Groundhog Day"" written by Philip K. Dick and turned into a Hollywood SF action blockbuster that utilizes the same effects as the ""Alien"" flick, and you will have a good idea of what happens here. Tom Cruise and his fellow warriors strut around in some crazy body armor tangling with nasty, multi-tentacled invaders. These aliens have the ability to control time - however, certain humans can reset days, and thus reboot once they have died and go back to where they were before, like a player learning a computer game. Or something like that. They have to track down an alien brain that is hiding in an aquifer below the Louvre Museum.

Has a lot of fun with its twisted logic,"""Edge of Tomorrow"" is essentially ""Groundhog day"" meets ""Aliens"" with a little bit of ""The Terminator"" or something thrown in. But maybe that's not fair. Because ""Edge of Tomorrow"" isn't just ripping off those excellent movies. Its clearly influenced by them, in making something that's almost as good, and equally original.Over many of the standard modern day block busters. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" starts things off properly. By putting its story first. Flick sees Tom Cruise (actually playing someone who starts as far from a hero) thrown into an alien war, where, after an unfortunate incident with one of the slithering beasties. He Becomes able to live the same day, over and over again, until he eventually becomes the best weapon there is in fighting these time altering bugs.As you can probably imagine. There is more to it than that, and the film has a lot of fun with its twisted logic. Throwing in plenty of action, and even plenty of laughs, to make for an altogether interesting movie.Much like the recent ""X-men – Days of future past"" the films only real downfall is its mind boggling ending. Here, feeling like a slapped on happy ""Hollywood ending."" When perhaps a darker one would have been the better way to go, in a film in which the usually heroic Tom Cruise is shamelessly killed over and over again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Pretty good movie, AAAAA I am dead! Pretty good movie, AAAAA I am dead!  Pretty good movie, AAAAA I am dead! ......","Director Doug Liman's ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is ""Groundhog Day"" on steroids with some mean looking aliens. The movie stars Tom Cruise as Lt. Colonel Cage, who is sent into battle against mimic aliens who have destroyed much of the world. Cage is not really programmed for battle, probably because he was caged too much in military offices instead of the battlefield. Cage is scared out of wits, but then something miraculous happens; he dies in battle, and then relives the same day repeatedly. Why that happens? Let me not spoil if for you, but let's say that he became a blood brother of the Omega alien mimic fraternity; they have that? The stunning Emily Blunt co-stars as Rita, a fierce warrior who was pivotal in destroying many of these mimic aliens in a past war. Cage groundhogs into Rita's world and the two team to destroy the Omega mimic plan to destroy mankind. The first two acts of ""Edge of Tomorrow"" kept me on the edge of my seat with its inventiveness in a futuristic action movie. However, the third act of ""mimic aliens vs. human soldiers"" action unfortunately mimicked many other formulaic battle-oriented action flicks. I did like Cruise and Blunt in their performances; and to be blunt with you it was refreshing to see Cruise as a coward character and not cruising with the same old ""machoman saving the world"" typecast character he has played many times before, while Blunt cruised with another bravado performance. So let me finish this review before it ends on the edge of tomorrow. But if you got nothing going on tomorrow, it's not a bad idea to live & relive the ""Edge of Tomorrow"". **** Good",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
We are back down that Tom Cruise road again...,"OK first off every time I see Tom Cuise in connection with anything, even so a movie, I just instantly imagine him saying ""I am an OT level 9 and I will ace this thing"". The actor is just boring and as featureless and cheesy as a frozen pizza and as cocky as he was back in Top Gun. I'm guessing if Arnold was the choice of great action movies for his accent, overly masculine features and brutality of character then Tom Cruise is like the quirky idiot, like Jim Carry just that he does understand that he is not funny in any way and should just quit showbiz once and for all. As far as the movie goes - don't really want to waste words: classic rivalry, an antihero woman and a love affair, a stock ""scary horrible super-alien"" with a twist, and the whole movie just wreaked of Groundhog Day and some indiscernible hints of Starship Troopers and Terminator V. And of course one-liners and almost toilet-humor level jokes. If you want to kill braincells and lower your IQ, this movie is right down your alley of boring action movies.For what it's worth the CG was good, but that's a given with such a budget.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Solidly suspenseful, funny, worth seeing","I'll be honest. I am not a Tom Cruise fan. Never have been. Watching him self-destruct on talk shows is riveting in an embarrassing sort of way. Having said that, he can do no wrong in this movie. Think Groundhog Day meets the Apocalypse and you have Edge of Tomorrow.Essentially, we have a bunch of nasty aliens that have invaded the Earth, we have to find their weak spot and kill them, and Tom Cruise is the guy who does just that. How he gets to the end result is where the fun begins. Playing somewhat against the heroic type, Cruise is Major Cage, a soldier who is afraid of conflict and has never known combat. He somehow gets caught in a time loop where he is forced to go through living and getting killed and being brought back all over again until he learns the skills, gains the proper mindset, and gets it right.There's really nothing new here, but how it's handled makes it all fresh and new somehow. Doug Liman (director) and his editor makes the learning process funny, engaging, yet they never forget to show the audience how horrible war really is--aliens or not--and the horror of it all is that Cruise's character has to submit himself to the indignity of being crushed, shot, stabbed, or mutilated in some way before he figures out what must be done.Emily Blunt matches him every step of the way as his trainer and possible future girlfriend. The rest of the cast is excellent, the music is solid, and of course, the special effects are solid and chilling. But Cruise is really the whole show, and he more than convincingly portrays, as his name suggests, a person caught in a cage not of his own making, yet somehow develops the courage and wherewithal to break out. Worth seeing, plot holes aside.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Saving Private Ryan Meets Groundhog Day In Power Armour,"I loved this movie. Clever, spectacular, moving, funny and violent. Loads of action. Flawless special effects. Huge battles. Hideous aliens. A platoon of totally convincing obnoxious British squaddies with shoulder mounted smart cannon.The mind-bending narrative is gotten across fairly clearly but you do have to think hard, though thankfully not as hard as Twelve Monkeys which actually gave me a headache. Every performance is spot-on and I think Cruise is getting better as he gets older. Amidst all the gory hyper-violence his sense of humour is perfectly judged enough to make you believe in the character.I think Tom Cruise is the only A-list actor who consistently picks good sci-fi scripts.

Cruise controls.,"""What I am about to tell you sounds crazy. But you have to listen to me. Your very lives depend on it. You see, this isn't the first time."" Lt. Col. Bill Cage (Tom Cruise)Although Edge of Tomorrow could have felt like Source Code on steroids or living Groundhog Day over and over, it doesn't. Thanks to The Usual Suspect's writer, Christopher McQuarrie, and his colleagues, this sci-fi engages your mind with scenarios that repeat but don't get old because the film doesn't either, despite the fact that the repetitive cycling through past and present has been worked over in film ad nauseum.Cage (Tom Cruise) is a soldier in a battle against Mimics, spider- octopus-like creatures doing a successful job taking over earth. That Cage begins as a reluctant combatant is a chance for the usually heroic Cruise to play against type. As much as we dislike Cage, he retains his sense of humor and the trademark Cruise self deprecation. In other words, Cruise is the linchpin of the film's success.Yet, Emily Blunt as Rita, the global soldier-hero, commands attention next to Cruise because she's a delicate actress who steps up to a warrior role and gives some of Cruise's sense of humor companionship. More than that nuance is the low-key romance between the two warriors, a joyful all- business attitude strong and sexy in its minimalism.While the plot requires some attention, and I consider that a plus, the demons are hardly unique, and their mother source hidden on earth is nothing new in fighting screen aliens either. What saves the repetitive trope is the sardonic script and superior acting, not forgetting that the estimable Brendan Gleeson plays the stodgy general who makes sure Major Cage is Private Cage. In addition, James Herbert's (Sherlock Holmes) editing from past to present is smooth and flawless.For those of you who would like to see Cruise die multiple times, this is the film for you. For those of us who have enjoyed his knowing swagger and youthful energy, he is, in his early 50's, a film star who can.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good Film But Not A Must See (My Thoughts),"I went into this film not really knowing what to expect, after watching the trailer several times however, I came to the conclusion that it was going to be another film focusing solely on the action scenes.After watching the film though, I take back my early conclusion. This film has a decent story line, where Tom Cruise as the main character actually conveys the characters emotions across extremely well and the relationship with the supporting actress, Emily Blunt, isn't forced and flows well.However I was able to predict what was going to happen next at different stages in the film which is why I only say the story line is decent (satisfactory) and not good. The story line is enough to capture you for the majority of the film, apart from the couple irrelevant scenes but not so good that it leaves you amazed.The action scenes were good, which boosts this rating as everyone likes the explosions and the well detailed close combat scenes but not enough to raise my rating above 7. I would say this film is a good one to watch currently, but not one that i suggest is a must see.This is my first review, so if you found this unhelpful or not well presented, I apologies and hope to write better entries in the near future.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very well done,"This is a welcome return to big budget form for Doug Liman after stumbling with the mess that was Jumper. This high concept screenplay is explored to its fullest potential and perhaps its greatest achievement is its sense of humor throughout. It's basically light gallows humor, watching Cruise die over and over again.The film is very well made and it's a welcome change of pace to see a vfx film shot on 35mm giving some grain and texture to the effects. In an era of filmmaking where most effects sequences are pre- visualized to an almost sterilizing degree, the action filmed feels remarkably spontaneous - thanks to Liman's chaotic, figure it out on set style of filmmaking, that has been aptly named 'Limania.'As Cruise gets caught in this time loop where he repeats the same day over and over, the script fleshes this scenario out where it never feels repetitive or predictable. A concept like this is prime for writing itself into a corner and forcing a last act to resolve everything, but Edge of Tomorrow avoids such last act problems. A minor gripe with the script would be that no one recognizes Cage as an officer, yet he is a prominent media figure that got millions of recruits to join the fight. That aside, Edge of Tomorrow is a hell of a lot of fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers,"As the story of EDGE OF TOMORROW unfolded before me, I couldn't help but notice the similarities to two minor classics of 1990s cinema: GROUNDHOG DAY, in which Bill Murray is forced to re-live the same day over and over again, and STARSHIP TROOPERS, in which humans battled aliens to the death. It's fair to say that the writers behind this one mined both films for inspiration and came up with a watchable, if light, concoction.The problem with EDGE OF TOMORROW really is its familiarity, but saying that, it still works as a worthwhile Hollywood blockbuster. The action scenes are intensive and impressive, bringing to mind the hectic and war-torn countryside of WW1, with which there are many similarities. Doug Liman, who handled THE BOURNE IDENTITY all those years ago, still has a handle on delivering well-paced and exciting action, so that's something.I'm not the biggest Tom Cruise fan around, but you can see why he liked this role: he gets a chance to play a kook, a dummy, for a change. I still think Emily Blunt keeps getting miscast in action-orientated roles, but she's acceptable here, and the supporting cast includes welcome turns from Bill Paxton, Brendan Gleeson, and the like. The sci-fi storyline is filled with twists and turns and it doesn't make much sense if you think about it too deeply, and the CGI isn't all that, but nonetheless EDGE OF TOMORROW is one of those films where you switch your brain off and just sit back and enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This was close to my perfect movie!,"I went with my wife. She generally tolerates coming along to my go to genre as long as we get to go to an art house flick etc occasionally. She was very sceptical as the movie started out... thinking that this was just going to be another typical scifi/action, but from the moment the movie shifted into second gear she was enthralled.It is an original piece with an excellent story and exquisite direction. The time travel/repeat concepts are handled superbly and it is thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining the whole way through... even quite funny at times. Tom cruise really nails the main character cage and you really get a feel for the psychological effects that he would likely be experiencing in the situation. It is slightly different start for him in that he is initially an unwilling hero... which I think makes it even cooler. Emily is also great in her role and definitely on par with Tom... not to mention smoking hot! There is a subtle line of romance between their characters which is just perfect. I think the emotional depth was incredible given the difficulty of the repeating day scenario, which doesn't even feel like a repeat... but you'll have to watch it to understand.Kudos to the editors too!My only criticism would be that the aliens seem little omnipotent at times but then they aren't at other times... presumably to suit the story. I would have liked them to be a little less versatile and less stringy!! Haha.We were both very impressed and satisfied with this film. It is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The best science fiction.,"The film is just gorgeous. Starting from the beautiful game of actors, ending with a super plot. The film keeps in suspense to the last frame. Everything is done so realistic that I want to shout like Stanislavsky ""believe."" Until the Esset, I can't understand how this masterpiece could fail at the box office. I personally revise this film with pleasure 4-5 times a year. I'm not a critic, I am an ordinary spectator, I don't understand why the masterpieces of the movie fail at the box office, and everyone loves some Marvel with a delusional script with a predictable plot. Tom Cruise played gorgeous, realistic, and other actors also did everything on top. I hope that the continuation will come soon, as high -quality as the first part.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Let's Do the Time Warp Again,"This film is recommended.What do you get when you mix the plot ideas of two classic films, the romantic comedy, Groundhog Day, and an old sci-fi thriller, Starship Troopers? You get its illegitimate offspring, Edge of Tomorrow (or the renamed: Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow, to be exact), a well-made sci-fi film that surprisingly failed at the box office in the States and Europe but earned far larger profits in the Asian markets abroad. It has now been resurrected in its DVD, Blu-Ray format under its new title. Will the film now have a longer shelf life and finally become a modest hit? Only time will tell.Starring the forever young Tom Cruise, chalking up yet another action figure to add to his resume, and the forever talented Emily Blunt, Edge of Tomorrow deserved a better fate. What it lacks in originality, it more that makes up in its thrilling action sequences and plot turns.The plot involves a military mission to stop an alien invasion by getting to the Omega, the source of power for the aliens and destroying it. The creatures (called Mimics?) are multi- tentacled spinning dervishes that dispatch their prey (meaning us) in mega seconds. Cruise plays William Cage, a soldier caught in a continuous time loop that creates the exact same moments  leading to his death by one of these monsters. Due to his untimely death and some sort of blood infusion, he discovers that he can control his fate with different outcomes every cycle.  With more practice training and guidance from a commanding officer Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), Cage becomes a better and more agile soldier, finally ready for combat.The film's plot structure gets a bit weary but Doug Liman directs the action scenes with much skill, even if the characters remain one dimensional. The film is well edited by James Herbert and Laura Jennings, with quick cuts and extreme close-ups to maintain the tension and fast pacing. At times, the film resembles a video game in its sharp hyper-kinetic movements and shoot-to-kill violence. The CGI are strong throughout even if the film's conceit grows monotonous.Cruise and Blunt have a nice chemistry, although the hints of their romantic relationship seems forced. Bill Paxton adds some comic touches as Cage's gruff boss, but Brendan Gleeson is wasted in his underwritten cliché of a character. Anyway, gamers and fan-boys are the film's target audience and they will enjoy the adrenaline rush of the endless war sequences in Edge of Tomorrow.

These are the voyages...,"A Star Trek: The Next Generation episode with far more computer programmed decorations. I suppose in 2014, discerning movie fans hadn't yet grown tired of movies overburdened with CGI and CGE. Even today, given $20 movie tickets, digital films with digitized characters and a handful of legitimate actors gross over $1 billion world wide.Tom Cruise does a great job playing the same emotionless automaton he mastered some time ago. I suppose that's why he blends so well with the artifice that surrounds him.My five star rating took as much into consideration, and that I stopped watching the film roughly half way through. I've seen the same predictable and formulaic story and fail to find the appeal of video game cut scenes edited together to make a film; one in which the human characters would be all but ignored without the preponderance of audiovisual gimmickry.The teal tragedy?

An inspiring performance especially for women out there, I think she knew the potential and importance of her character and displays an incredibly impressive performance here.

Amazing!!!!,"I'm not a great reviewer but I had post about this movie, it's very good, story is brilliant and acting is perfection by the main and supporting cast.You think that the repeating of the same day would get tenuous after awhile, it surprisingly doesn't, each day is the same but different enough to still be entertaining and very well done!The action scenes are very exciting and made my heart go and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time!Tom cruise just gets better and better with every movie, I know some are not huge fans of his but I think he's one of the best actors out there and one of the best action stars!If you want great action, acting and a brilliant story line this film is for you.One thing I will say is when I watch a movie the end is one of the most important thing for me, those last 30 seconds of that movie leaves an impression on me and this ending *no spoilers* made me smile and I thought wow I need a sequel badly!

"Glitzy and Substantial, But That Ending...","This dash of cinematic junk food boasts a crisp, chocolatey effects extravaganza for an outer shell and a wash of sticky, creamy sci-fi curiosity at its core. The concept is tricky but fascinating, a bit stretched but not so far that it completely shatters the illusion. It's basically Groundhog Day meets Independence Day, with Tom Cruise wearing a great big suit of mechanized armor as its showpiece. Go into battle, kill some aliens, meet a grisly demise, respawn at the checkpoint and try it all over again; that's basically the plot. It's best when Cruise is relegated to mere rapid-fire cannon fodder, trying like hell to make the most of his chances and failing miserably. The ride gets markedly less entertaining, and more humdrum, as it slides into sentimentality and finality. The ending is a real whiff, too, and undoubtedly colors my memory of the better bits that I'd enjoyed previously. It smacks of a last-minute rewrite, something that's utterly at-odds with the dashes of smart, dark material that had spiced things earlier in the ride. A film that wants to be flashy and ballsy, but instead finds itself tamed and neutered.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Great I Prefer Oblivion Better,"Watched Edge of Tomorrow with my friend recently it was an interesting film. I liked the sci-fi background of the story. It was very interesting and definitely not what I expected to be at all. Watching this movie in a way does remind me of another recent Sci-fi film that Tom Cruise acted, OblivionThe cast was great. Tom demonstrates again why he's perfect for these kind of roles. He portrays his seriousness and funny side both together very well. Emily Blunt was great beside Cruise but her character didn't really interest me that much. I can't believe I saw Bill Paxton again. The last time I saw him was in 'Thunderbirds R Go'. He was great to watch and I really liked his sergeant bullying attitude. The rest of the cast did a good job and the movie really made me glued to my seatHowever, there were some minor complains though. What I find a bit disturbing was the reset and start all over again button part(for those who do not understand what I'm talking about, you'll know when you watch the movie). Although it was an interesting concept, it got a bit annoying to me as the movie progressed. The story was not that interesting in my opinion but it did leave me intriguing to find out what would happen next in most parts but I did felt kind of bored during the movie as wellOverall, a decent film but maybe not one which I would watch again since I'm not a huge Sci-fy and Tom Cruise fan. However, die-hard fans of Sci- fy and Tom Cruise I think will like this movie a lot so go give a try. To sum it up, Edge of Tomorrow was good but Oblivion in my opinion was better",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best Sci Fi action films you'll see,"After a weird start and set up (how Tom Cruise gets put into combat) this film quickly finds its pace as a Sci Fi Groundhog Day. It plays it out perfectly, not spending too much time on the repeats of certain storyline's but just enough to enjoy Major William Cages growth as a character (well played ofcourse by Tom Cruise).Emily Blunt is also fantastic as Rita Vratas something the ""Heavy metal b..."". There is great humour, great heart and a great ending to this film.

Falls short of its potential,"I'm a huge Groundhog Day fan. Unsurprisingly, I'm charmed by the basic premise of Edge Of Tomorrow. Sadly, the idea has not been consequently exploited. There are many plot holes and we're missing real tension and intensity.Although I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, I have to respect how he can always lift a movie with a very reliable performance. I loved Emily Blunt, hovering between military toughness and subtle femininity.If you didn't know the main plot before seeing the movie (a must if you want to enjoy it fully), the movie starts off with a surprise. But after an adrenaline-filled introduction, the story loses pace and starts stumbling from one plot hole to the next. The atmosphere suffers from the lack of different scenery and the overdose of scene repeats (necessary for the story but just not handled with the required finesse). If it weren't for the lead roles, I would put this off as a boring little scifi-flick.Fortunately, the chemistry between Blunt and Cruise is excellent, which helps keep us on our toes and motivated to follow the story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
All the great ingredients for a success... BUT...,"Had a huge expectation for this movie. I love Science Fiction, love special effects, love Tom Cruise movies, and so on... But this story is disappointing... so disappointing... Christopher McQuarrie was one of the screenplay writers, and I loved his screenplay for cult classic ""The Usual Suspects"" and also the more recent ""Jack Reacher"" also with Tom Cruise... but this was SO disappointing, maybe it's what happens when you get 3 writers doing a screenplay. Yes, full of special effects, Emily Blunt as blond looks sexy, cool machinery, high budget movie, all the ingredients for a successful movie. But the story sucks, nothing original about it. It's kind of mixture of Starship Troopers with Ground Hog's Day, smells Anime and an oldie computer game Sony Planetside.

The movie was laced with perfect doses of wit and humour as well. Moreover, all the actors, led by Tom and Emily, did a fantastic job to say the least. The last scene as the cue for the song ""Love me again"" (one if my all-time favs) was the perfect icing on the cake! This film is surely one for the ages.

The Definitive Summer Blockbuster of 2014,"The summer of 2014 has already seen few behemoths in the form of Godzilla, X-Men: Days of Future Past & How To Train Your Dragon 2 but nobody was really expecting this Tom Cruise starrer, which debuted on the silver screen a few weeks ago without any significant buzz, to surprise them the way it has & with every passing moment, it continues to gain momentum with its strong 'word of mouth' praise.Edge of Tomorrow tells the story of Major William Cage who hasn't seen a day in combat but finds himself caught in a time loop after killed within minutes in a war against an alien race. But as he's forced to experience the same battle over n over again, his skill to handle the adversaries of war gets better and with the help of a Special Forces warrior, he ultimately gets closer & closer to defeating the seemingly invincible enemy.Director Doug Liman has made excellent use of the available resources here to craft an action film that's as smart & engaging as it is entertaining. The screenplay is inspired from the Japanese novel, All You Need Is Kill, and also infuses elements from cinema classics of the past to come out with an original storyline which is then further refined with clever use of action, wit, drama & unpredictability to deliver a cinematic experience that's highly rewarding.Coming to the technical aspects, cinematography expertly exhibits the director's filming trademarks & makes prevalent use of frequently cut hand-held shots. Editing is undoubtedly its finest aspect as not for once does its repeating segments feel dull or tiresome, VFX & sound are state-of-the-art stuffs that never take the viewer's focus away from the story and the background score ends up adding even more intensity & energy to the whole package.Edge of Tomorrow features an overall dependable cast amongst which Tom Cruise & Emily Blunt end up impressing the most. Playing his most challenging, funniest & meatiest role in a long time, Tom Cruise delivers a fabulous performance as William Cage but was constantly challenged by Emily Blunt who truly kicks ass with a ruthlessly aggressive rendition of her character, Rita Vrataski aka ""Full Metal Bitch""; the decorated veteran who guides & trains Cage after recognizing his current predicament.Although the film is no doubt an endlessly entertaining extravaganza, I still had few minor issues with it. One being the ending that isn't very fulfilling in accordance to its build-up & other is the inclusion of a romantic arc near the end which was absolutely unnecessary. Still, the positives outweighs the negatives by a huge margin as Edge of Tomorrow manages to get most things right & is the perfect summer blockbuster of the year with enough quality & quantity to dazzle most moviegoers.On an overall scale, Edge of Tomorrow is a smartly scripted, cleverly narrated, brilliantly directed, energetically photographed, tightly edited, timely humoured, wonderfully scored & strongly performed motion picture that may look like an action-laden video game but damn me if it isn't a remarkably well-played one by its cast & crew. If you still haven't seen it then cut the foreplay & just go for it before it completes its run on the big screen. You can thank me later.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Groundhog Day with aliens?,"Director - Doug Liman Starring - Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt Take one part Groundhog Day, one part Matrix, even a pinch of G.I. Joe, and you end up with Tom Cruise's latest movie. But don't let the sound of this unique mash up fool you, this is an entertaining sci-fi, action movie.For some reason, there are people in this world that do not like Tom Cruise. Actually, they detest him, believe him to be the spawn of Satan, etc, etc, etc... However, I have no problem with the diminutive super star. I actually enjoy his films; Mission Impossible, The Last Samurai and that cameo in Tropic Thunder. I like him and, in this film, I still like him. He is well suited as William Cage, a smooth talking mouth piece for the military who is 'drafted' into a fight against the Mimics, aliens who have invaded earth. The audience isn't told why they're here but, as a scene mid way through the film explains, it doesn't matter why they're here, they're here and that's all that matters. So there isn't any convoluted explanations to get in the way of the action.Cruise is joined by Emily Blunt who is quite believable in her role as fellow soldier Rita, aka The Full Metal Bitch. Blunt obviously worked hard for this role and just the sight of her biceps made me want to weep into my bag of maltesers.Together they share a secret; the ability to re-live the same day over and over again which could be the key to ending the alien invasion.The two stars definitely share a chemistry, although at times you're not sure if it is romance or just comradery. There are also some real comedic moments; Tom Cruise can be a funny guy.The film does well to keep interest considering how many times you see the same thing or have to guess if the scene is for the first time or a do-over. There were a couple of times when I thought 'enough already' and maybe the final part could have been brought forward by about 15 minutes but that might say more for my attention span than Liman's direction.I have to say that there is something magical about seeing London on the big screen; the capital is displayed in all her glory at several points. It's nice to know that the aliens invade countries other than America every now and then.This is based on the short novel 'All You Need is Kill' and I'm sure some fans of that will complain about Cruise's role in the film (much the same as when he took on the part of Jack Reacher). But for the uninitiated, such as myself, this movie is a fine enough reason to go to the cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Sci-Fi film with fantastic pacing and breathtaking CGI,"Tom Cruise plays Cage, a military officer who is forced to be a solider and thrown into the front line to help the human race end the alien invasion of earth. Some of the rare, more powerful aliens have abilities to reverse time and reset the day when they die, Cage develops this same power when he kills one of those aliens in battle and is burnt alive with the extra-terrestrial being. Cage now has the ability to return to the moment he awoke prior to the battle and restart the day again, offering him countless attempts to try and end the war.On paper it doesn't sound like anything ground-breaking and sounds like it would have many unoriginal Sci-Fi elements we have seen many times before. While it does have its faults it certainly excels in other aspects and delivers an extremely effective Sci-Fi/action flick.Visually this film is absolutely stunning. Every aspect of the CGI is perfect and you really feel immersed into the environment. The action scenes are sometimes a little shaky and up-close but the camera work is very well done that it blends in different angles to ensure you see the majority of the action clearly. There is a scene with a car and a caravan which stands out to me, look out for it! The Alien creatures also look good with really impressive movement and features. The weapons and battle gear that the soldiers wear are created with a futuristic look but not too far-fetched, they look quite realistic and believable.The pace of the movie is perfect. A problem with plenty of Sci-Fi films is when they delve into the scientific jargon, taking 30 minutes to tell the viewer irrelevant bits of information, over complicating matters. This is what usually puts me off Sci-Fi movies and the fact that Edge of Tomorrow decided to keep the science talk to a minimum was very much welcomed by myself! It keeps it to a minimum and only reveals key info, keeping the pacing of the film very well. Tom Cruise dies dozens of times in this movie and has to relive his previous hours many times. The directors did a great job in editing this so the viewer doesn't get bored, the fact Cage dies many times and relives the same hours 20+ times but doesn't feel repetitive is a brilliant achievement. The movie is just under 2 hours and I didn't get bored once.I do however have a couple of negatives with Edge of Tomorrow. There are a few plot holes which I won't go into as to not ruin any of the story. The plot holes aren't major but do seem very simple and a little baffling as to why they weren't explained. Emily Blunts gives a great performance but her character appears clichéd with cheesy one liners and predictable actions. The love element is also something that I wouldn't welcome but it is something I have come to expect and accept from Hollywood blockbusters so I can't criticise the movie for this! I feel the start has a few too many cheesy one liners and poorly delivered jokes which takes away from the seriousness of the story.Overall, Edge of Tomorrow is a very fun, well-choreographed, well-acted Sci Fi action flick which exceeded my expectations by quite some way. The action scenes are very well created with fantastic CGI, the action is broken up by impressive dialogue scenes that keep the viewer interested by keeping to the story and not getting carried away with unnecessary script. Great pacing, great action and a good entertaining story.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Definitely in my top three Cruise flicks of The 2010's for sure.,"This movie was much better than any right than it had to be. The action was very well directed with a lot of origional ideas and content on display in this one. It does feel a little bit dumb at times, but the main idea that carries the entire story of the film is an origional one and is utilized extremley well that it easy to understand and explain at face value, but goes deeper and plays on your mind a bit if you dare to scratch the surface and go deeper.Cruise and Blunt had great chemistry in this film and is on par or perhaps even better than the relationship between Hardy and Theron in Fury Road. I don't like comparing this movie to Fury Road because they are very different in a lot of ways as this depends on futuristic military technology while Fury Road is post-apocalyptic with very little sci-fi that is actually in it. Though I do think they are at equals in terms of direction and quality.It is also one of the best adaptations I've ever seen which was based off a Manga that I have not read. I wouldn't say it completley up there with Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings but it is really is fantastic for what it is.It is incredibly rewatchable and makes you think about both their timelines and where they actually fit in to the overarching world of the story. It's awesome. Definitely see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

My only complaints is there are a couple times where the action can feel a little bland and the first 20 minutes are necessary for the set up but is a little boring.

"Clever, funny and absolutely thrilling SciFi blockbuster","This movie is FANTASTIC!!. Just think of this. A sci-fi action movie, that is set in a dystopian future, where high octane mechanical sorta aliens invade earth, that involves time travel, that has Tom cruise fighting away in a metal exoskeleton suit...i mean what more could you want! Now for those who think this might just be another typical bleak SciFi plot like 'oblivion'or 'battle L.A' it really isn't. This is such a fresh take on the same genre.The trailer to this movie really underplays it which in my opinion is a good thing so as to not give audience false hopes. This is not just an action movie but is just as humourous as ""groundhog day"". The scenes were taken in such a engaging manner. As there are repeated sequences in the movie it could quite easily have become monotonous but they have managed to take it in such an awesome and fresh manner that always keeps us engaged.The plot of edge of tomorrow is based of a Manga. The action sequences are mind-blowing. There's no shaky cam or jump cuts which i absolutely hate in action movies. The CGI was also pretty darn cool and all the stunts were well choreographed. The entire battle on the beach was one of the best I've seen in movies ever! The story is really well paced and does not feel rushed or filled with convinient plot devices . There's a perfect blend of action and humour and none of the humour feels forced and almost all of them land. This movie is also very smart. By that i mean it doesn't treat you like a kid, its very smart and entertaining and really fun. It really surprises you, i really miss the feeling when u watch a really fresh plot and you have absolutely no idea where the movie is headed, and the they really stuck the landing, the third act of the movie was thrilling jaw-dropping and absolutely insane!As for Tom Cruise he was my favourite part of the movie and this is by far my favourite role of his in recent times. Its not his usual kind of role and it's something very refreshing to see and Tom cruise absolutely nails this. Every aspect of his character in this movie is perfect. He's smart funny and character that audience will love to ride along with in this movie. He also does most of the stunts himself which makes all the action sequences all the more realistic... this again is why i always feels an actor that does most of the stunts himself without stunt doubles is always whats best for an action movieEmily blunt is just BADASS here. She isn't just a sidekick or someone that gets shadowed by the lead actor.Overall Edge of Tomorrow is everything i love in a SciFi action movie. It's clever funny thrilling entertaining with really great cast and special effects. I really wish a lot of action movies nowadays would take a leaf outta this one. Really look forward to more of Doug Liman's work. You don't wanna miss this movie trust me",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Brilliant with a unique female character,What more could you want? And how refreshing to see a female heroine played by the amazing Emily Blunt and not the usual girlfriend disposable role.

Bluntxsutawney Phil,"This Groundhog approximation of a sci-fi invasion thriller is fairly refreshing for a big dumb action film, but suffers severely from third act bloat and has a romance plot that feels almost overwhelmingly perfunctory. J Squad and Paxton don't get nearly enough screentime and the aliens themselves feel quite ill-defined. Still, it's nice to see a lot of strangely downcast UK filming locations (doubling for Europe here) and underrated Britfolk like Tony Way and the great Franz Drameh.

A satisfactory Sci-Fi film actually justifies itself,"Action-packed summer tent-poles continue with EDGE OF TOMORROW, Tom Cruise stars in this hardcore alien slasher (with an estimated exorbitant budget of $178,000,000), directed by THE BOURNE IDENTITY (2002, 8/10) alum Doug Liman, although it has been dead on arrival in the domestic box office, Tom Cruise' more appealing international star-power can be the last straw to make the ends meet.Blatantly ripping of the time-loop concept from GROUNDHOG DAY (1993, 9/10) and SOURCE CODE (2011, 8/10) , the film craftily grafts it on a Sci-Fi battleground with Mimics, an alien species (with metal tentacles and high-speed mobility) invading the Mainland Europe, after his first-day in the front-line, rookie soldier Cage (Cruise) dies in a blast together with a giant blue Mimics (Alpha, one out of several millions), doused in its blood, he miraculously wakes up alive and kicking at the camp one day before, afterward, every time he dies, time jumps back to this exact same time slot and he gains experience while others are oblivious of all the happenings.So, there is a quite plausible explanation about this whimsical setting, after meeting a female warrior Rita Vrataski (Blunt), who has undergone the same situation months earlier and been deprived of her ability after a blood transfusion, Cage sides with her to find out a way to destroy Omega, the highly-intelligent brain behind all the Mimics who can anticipate human race's every and each move because it has the ability to turn back time, whenever an Alpha one dies, time- loop is intrigued to revive it to a near time-line, by coincidence Cage is mistakenly resuscitated in light of covered with Alpha's blood, he becomes a surrogate of the Alpha he killed as far as in Omega's mindset, it all lies in the blood.After umpteen death (sometimes conducted by a cavalier Rita and teems with satisfactory gags here), Cage has evolved into a competent warrior and finally, they are on a one-last-chance journey (after Cage loses his ability too) to exterminate Omega under the Louvre Museum before the losing battle begins.Slyly imitating the WWII D-Day invasion, the movie is a rip-roaring riot with its fast-paced editing (cheap-looking CGI though, makes one wonder how do they spend all that money? Cruise's pocket, maybe), Cruise is always in his tiny hero mode although this time he starts as a total greenhorn, the opening two-hander between him and Brendan Gleeson (as General Brigham) is rib-tickling as though the hefty Brigham is going to personally teach Cage a lesson for being a smug business man who gets cold feet when coerced to enter the real battlefield.Emily Blunt (fresh from Rian Johnson's time-travel enterprise LOOPER 2012, 6/10) brings about a potent pulse as a bona-fide heroine, almost equally shares the save-the-world undertaking with Cruise, pitifully, the film is betting on Cruise's trademark, what would happen if it is Rita who drops the grenade near the coda? Maybe with a bit flashback of the expedition about how she finally cracks the time-loop theory in the first place. I cannot even imagine that, how awesome it would be!Anyway, the picture is compelling entertaining, with a sophisticated script behind to support its primary assumptions, with a video-game setting of immortality to pander to its core audience, and efficiently omits the tiresome context-supplement process every time Cage restarts his routine day. We can only blame Cruise's waning sway in North American for its lukewarm debut weekend, it is time to consider Blunt as an action lead and she will shine no matter what.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT -  Movies to watch ONLY (don't use logic).,"Well happy to be the 1st or 2nd to watch this movie.Just finish watching this movie. 1st thing comes to my mind is I don't have NOTHING stand out to talk about.I mean yes at 1st the time loop was quite fascinating, but after several times, it getting boring. in several movies that have similar plot, each time loop will create a different story. Whereas in this movies, it just like when we playing FPS shooting games, we repeat the same stage and remember where all the enemies until we pass the level.The computer graphic itself, just like others film, nothing stands out.The story line just confusing and bit disappointment. Because with good actor like Tom Cruise, they can come out with better story line. Lots of question mark such as : - In the end, when Cage killed the Omega, he gains the time loop ability once more. But When he done time loop. he come back to he helicopter scene, it should be 2 day before he killed the Omega, but he came back form the similar helicopter scene but the Omega already destroyed? - Also when he gained back the time loop ability. it means that he becomes immortal. as long as he doesn't get any blood transfusion then he cannot died, every time he died that he just will be returned to the same chopper scene.lets cut to the end. My conclusion of this movies is that this is a Sci-Fi film. so just sit back and enjoy, don't use any logic to understand this film, or you just will ended up with disappointment.Enjoy the movie guys.* This is only my cent of the movie.

Absolutely Brilliant! Pure popcorn entertainment!,"Aliens (Mimics) have invaded the Earth and they have quickly destroyed most of Europe. The UDF, (United Defense Force) a global Military Alliance has planed a invasion of France. A surprise attack using a newly developed armored suits.

Wow! I really like this movie. Edge of Tomorrow is a fun, fantastic action packed Sci-Fi thriller with a cool B-movie feel to it.And what a great story! It is clever and intense, with a bit of humor and great performances by Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. Cage is so different a character than Tom Cruise's usual parts, so awesome and so unexpected!

The Almost Perfect Science Fiction Film,"Say what you will about Tom Cruise, he's made some good movies, and a few that are excellent.This is one of the latter.Combining a Groundhog Day sensibility, with an Aliens-style gritty world, it resonates on every level.Emily Blunt, an excellent actress, turns in a very good performance that provides a weight and gravitas that perfectly counterbalances Cruise's shallow and cowardly initial character arc.Working against type, Cruise slowly morphs from weasel to unwilling combatant to weary but committed hero.It gives the film, and all the supporting characters, heart and a belief that the stakes are real. Stakes that are turned on their head more than once.The alien design is still (nine years later) super original and mesmerizing.Bill Paxton, in a role that could have been wasted, injects humor and a sense of disbelief that mirrors the viewer's own perspective.You'll watch this more than once, and be rewarded for all the easy to miss great details from your first jaw-dropped viewing.Highly recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

What a great damn movie. I really hope the sequel comes soon. It makes us think in a groundhog way if the world was about to end and we had to step up as a nobody maybe even a lazy bum and we were forced to make something out of ourselves or have the whole world destroyed what a burden we would have to take on ourselves.

A Schwarzenegger type movie without Arnold,"Saw this nine years ago and due to streaming, like with many films these days, I thought I'd take a look again as they play well on gigantic flat screens. I remembered this being a lot of fun and exciting and some of that still is true, but the opening is sort of like a B movie and while a lot of it is still fun in a rollercoaster kind of way, this action packed version of a Groundhog Day about essentially a coward in the military forced to fight an alien invasion and man up, is sometimes over the top cartoonish. I'm not much of a fan of Tom Cruise so I'll leave it at that, but Emily Blunt who is a fine actress is totally wasted here. This is Hollywood popcorn and as such it's not bad and it certainly is not boring, but it's for those who are enchanted by Marvel movies and similar such things that are so popular today. Interesting that this couldn't make its money in this country, though it was a hit worldwide. After checking some stats out, the same can be said for a lot of Cruise's non-Mission Impossible/Top Gun films since War of the Worlds 18 years ago. His films seem to need other countries to recoup, though not when he's playing Ethan Hunt. I had forgotten that Bill Paxton was in this and he is fun.

"While the journey feels long, the resolution is satisfying, making this a solid entry in the science fiction genre.","Edge of Tomorrow (2014) takes place during an alien invasion that threatens to take over the world. The government develops a way to give a soldier a serum that causes him to relive the same day-the day of the invasion-over and over until the aliens are defeated. As he dies countless times, he reaches a point where hope seems all but lost. Can he find a way to turn the tide, or is the alien conquest of Earth inevitable?The film is directed by Doug Liman (Swingers) and stars Tom Cruise (Cocktail), Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada), Bill Paxton (Aliens), Brendan Gleeson (Gangs of New York), and Noah Taylor (Almost Famous).The cast is impressive from top to bottom. The special effects, particularly in the action sequences and the design of the alien creatures, are outstanding. Bill Paxton stands out as a highlight among the side characters, bringing his usual charm and energy to the role. The concept of the film is unique and engaging, though the repeated training and failure sequences felt a bit overdone at times. That said, the love story between the leads is well-developed, even if it's somewhat predictable.While the journey feels long, the resolution is satisfying, making this a solid entry in the science fiction genre.

This blockbuster still holds up well,"An excellent film, one which surprisingly inspires and motivates you to achieve something more than you really are. This is the most wonderful aftertaste. Another plus is Tom Cruise himself, who is a pro at making every blockbuster movie appear even more epic. This time, his character has to go on one of the most challenging sci-fi journeys in the Groundhog Day-esque fashion.The effect of a time loop allows the film to not lose the momentum even for a minute, which is facilitated by the appropriate musical accompaniment. Although there is a lot of action, you perceive it more as an auxiliary element of the picture, where it is much more interesting to observe how the same scene and situation changes every time.As for the ending, which has already given rise to a bunch of criticism... Personally, I have already found an explanation on the net that completely suited me, and at the same time looks logical. The ending is still a bit controversial, but I'm personally fine with it. Plus, I love this type of endings.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Fantastic Movie!,"The first thought after watching it is - incredible! This is truly a remarkable creation by Doug Liman. The film grabs you from the very first minutes and doesn't let go until the very end. Normally, I finish my reviews with a recommendation on whether to watch a movie or skip it. But this time, I'm breaking my tradition and wholeheartedly urging everyone who comes across this text to make time for Edge of Tomorrow. It absolutely deserves your attention, and you should see it at the first opportunity.The energy of the film keeps you on the edge of your seat. You jump from the intense action scenes, marvel at the stunning visual effects, laugh at the sharp humor, and deeply empathize with the characters. Of course, you can catch nods to masterpieces like Groundhog Day, the thrilling Source Code, or the iconic The Matrix. But Edge of Tomorrow takes the best of these influences and transforms them into something unique and inspiring. It's a vivid, dynamic, and mind-blowing movie!As for the performances, Tom Cruise exceeded all expectations. There were times when I doubted his talent, but this film triumphantly brought him back into my list of favorite actors. He excelled in action sequences, dramatic moments, and even comedic ones. Watching his performance was an absolute delight.Emily Blunt is the embodiment of strength, grace, and inner power. There's something regal about her, which likely landed her the lead role in The Young Victoria. However, here she shows a completely different side - as a magnificent warrior. Her portrayal of Rita is powerful, determined, and inspiring. Every gesture, glance, and emotion reveals her depth as an actress. The meditation scenes with her are moments of pure harmony and strength.The entire cast deserves praise. Even Bill Paxton, whom I hadn't particularly admired before, delivered a brilliant performance here. His lines and mannerisms left a lasting impression. It's bittersweet to remember this, knowing that Paxton is no longer with us. His talent will be missed, but his work in this film is a wonderful tribute to his legacy.The graphics and special effects are top-notch. The Mimics are incredibly fast, flexible, and detailed. At times, I caught myself literally dropping my jaw in amazement. It's a visual masterpiece! Christophe Beck's score perfectly complements the film's atmosphere. Every note amplifies the intensity of the scenes, filling them with fantastic energy.Edge of Tomorrow leaves you with the brightest emotions. It's a movie you'll want to rewatch, diving back into its world again and again.

Plenty of action in a Groundhog Day inspired concept.,I initially couldn't help but feel that this movie was another Tom Cruise ego project but then thankfully it started to get interesting. I will admit that the concept is a bit of a stretch and the whole groundhog day theme never really appealed to me but they did it in a way that didn't make you feel like you were watching the same thing over and over again.If I had to change one thing it would be to simplify the story. There are too many competing ideas and the movie goes past in a blur of information. At one point I found myself questioning what this movie was really about and the point of it. There is no real backstory as to why or how the aliens invaded which makes it a bit confusing. Aside from that though it's a good action flick.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Badass and Boring,"The plot's basic idea is a good one -- basically ""Groundhog Day"" for the martial set. The special effects are good as well -- top-notch, as was most of the acting. But it played as extremely boring for me, and some of the tropes just ticked me off, especially The Badass Chick meme. The Badass Chick is tough, man. She's the least female creature around, able to kick any and all butt, never emotionally expressing anything other than, ""Check me out; I'm A Badass Chick! I'm cynical and tough! Been hurt, but won't talk about it; instead, I'll just kick yer ass and defy gravity!"" I loathe characters who are supposed to be human, but have no human characteristics.

"Amazing film, in concept and in visual majesty; one of Cruise' best performances ever","Major Cage (Tom Cruise) has been sent to Britain from America to chronicle and film the battles against an alien enemy, the Mimics, who have overtaken Europe. As England fears the huge, insect-like aliens will soon cross the Channel, they are preparing another D-Day invasion. Astonishingly, Cage has never been trained in battle, despite his rank, as he is an information specialist. Yet, the General in charge of the invasion expects Cage to lead soldiers on the field. He can't, he explains. Soon, the General orders Cage's arrest, the American is stripped down to the rank of private, and ordered to a squadron of paratroopers. The invasion is the next day and Cage, in an elaborate suit of armor he knows nothing about, will take part. The result is ghastly, Cage is overcome with fright and sees the fearsome aliens mow down one soldier after another. But, there's a twist. As Cage fires on an exceptionally large alien, called an Alpha, the human is covered in Alpha blood as they both die. In the next moment, Cage is back in time to the point of his discovering himself to be a private and hauled off to meet the squadron. Again. Along the way, he meets an exceptional soldier, Rita (Emily Blunt), who has destroyed many of the Mimics by herself. She explains why. IF you receive alien blood, even on the surface, you are part of Einstein's fourth dimension, time. Therefore, you now have the ability to ""loop back"" indefinitely and learn from each encounter on how to fight the Mimics and take them down. As Cage and Rita live, die, and repeat, will they be successful in freeing the Earth of these hideous Mimics? What a thrill ride this movie is! No, the concepts aren't totally original but borrowed and embellished very well and the visuals of the movie are majestic. How terrifyingly real are these aliens and how epic each battle is. Cruise has rarely been better, from scared civilian to strong fighter and Blunt is equally fine and regal.

A fairly alright Action flick,"This movie polarized me in how I felt about it, for one I think the drama and characters are written fairly competently. Action while a bit generic and having too many cuts or shaky camera for my liking was still done well. While there is plenty of CGI the practical outfits look great and made me glad I wasn't seeing CGI all the time. There is plenty of here to enjoy. I do however think that the drama while there didn't do much for me, while both the leads are passable given the circumstances it never sold me on the turmoil they are in. The runtime it's given too felt a little bit lagging at the end. This certainly isn't a bad film but for how much I head the drama was great it never gave me a through line.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Military-Entrtainment complex fools yet again,"Was everyone who reviewed this movie six years old and hopped up on sugar?
I'm amazed and disheartened by peoples idiocy.
This, in the first 5 minutes is an attempt to cynically evoke the memories, and thus wholesome patriotic virtues by recasting the historical WWII battle for Europe.
Thre fact that the 'aliens' originate in Hamburg is no coincidence, and the master plan is a simile of D-Day.
With America and the U.N. Suffering from an image problem, it seems wise from the viewpoint of the U.S. to remind the world that they once believed they fought for freedom and blah blah.
I suspect the 'time loop' trope is to remind us to be ever vigilant ( and thus reliant on good 'ol U.S of A ).
The Germans I'm sure have endured enough without this barely concealed political trite from a nation so hypocritical it has forgotten what it stands for.
For those of you who think I have no basis for such a charge, simply search ' military-entertainment complex ' and you may realise that many action blockbusters are in fact, recruitment tools and simply plain propaganda.

The Must-See Blockbuster of the Summer,"Summer has been the staple season for the studios' uninspired, unoriginal, and money-driven projects, but that rare moment when a decent blockbuster comes along that completely contradicts all three of those points is the moment of unimaginable relief. Edge of Tomorrow is very much that rare moment for this year's summer, but that shouldn't be surprising considering the fact that Tom Cruise almost always chooses the best projects even when they're primarily action flicks. In this case, the movie starts off incredibly strong as you remain fascinated, trying to figure out what exactly is transpiring on-screen while being tossed into the very heat of the moment.The spectacle benefits from the likable and charismatic presence of Tom Cruise, portraying a respected officer of the US army named (Major) William Cage who is suddenly commanded to enter the front lines of the most heated destination in the current war between men and alien: France. He is understandably frightened—very much so to the point where he desperately attempts to convince the General otherwise and avoid this disposition at all costs (even reaching the extent of blackmailing this General). Unfortunately, his persuasive skills falter, and thus, he wakes up at an army base soon thereafter, fully unprepared as he heads into combat in a robust exosuit with his fellow soldiers. Eventually, Cage discovers that he wields a terribly powerful, yet utterly outlandish, power that allows him to wake up at a particular point in the day every time he diesin any circumstance.Edge of Tomorrow features a refreshingly unique story and instead of simply duplicating Groundhog Day's style and structure like many accused it of doing before even seeing the film, it focuses on Tom Cruise's incessant string of deaths (presented more lightheartedly than it sounds) which undeniably helps keep the film fresh and interesting. The thrilling picture boasts a very tight and smart script that excellently guides the viewers through a complex and original plot without stumbling and bewildering us, cleverly maneuvering around any trap that might tire the audience due to the repetition that's infused in its concept. It does so by constantly and creatively finding new ways to continue amusing and intriguing the audience, including taking advantage of the witty humor that the ideas of such a story provoke.Emily Blunt brings her extraordinary acting chops and newfound badassery to unite with Tom Cruise's character and fight this highly threatening enemy side-by-side. The pairing generates astonishing chemistry that results in some terrific, heartfelt, and hilarious moments between the two. In addition, the film also possesses a very impressive look to it through its filmic grayness and grit, featuring some truly exciting action sequences where all kinds of objects and beings fly past the camera while water and dirt is spattering the screen. In other words, this production is beautifully intense. The enemies of this narrative (called Mimics) are tremendously terrifying; their elastic, arachnid- like appearance already inspires sheer panic, but as soon as they start effortlessly swarming and killing every soldier in their sight, you perfectly realize that these are not just the standard summer blockbuster villains that are easily fought off by a heroic and honorable protagonist.With that being said, after a slew of intelligent twists and turns, this Sci-fi extravaganza culminated unsatisfyingly, heavily compromising when it came time to wrap up. The reluctance to a darker finish is ridiculous and certainly didn't fit the confident and bleak direction the narrative promised. You could tell how unfitting it was just by glancing at its source material—a Japanese novel titled All You Need Is Kill, which contains a far darker ending, but obviously Hollywood thought it was too large of a risk since their mentality that every movie should end as a crowd-pleaser still remains. Even though its climax was delivered weakly and insecurely, Edge of Tomorrow—as a whole— is undoubtedly the best summer blockbuster so far, exceptionally balancing pure fun, humor, and a seriously thought-provoking story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

True Blockbuster,"Edge of Tomorrow has anything you could ask for in a Sci-Fi blockbuster. It has robots, aliens, big guns, car chases, and even Tom Cruise; mashed together into an exciting high concept story. While these elements aren't completely original, the film put these things together with plenty of personality, thus it is predictably all fun. It would have been nicer if it explored a little more deeper within its intriguing ideas to end up being a fully epic blockbuster, but Edge of Tomorrow is still quite the adventure that goes beyond the typical excess of explosions that the audience have been swallowing these days.The main concept is pretty intriguing indeed. It definitely reminds you of Groundhog Day or Source Code, except it takes place in the middle of an alien invasion. This idea excellently works when it tries to make a joke out of it. The story doesn't really flesh out anything beyond the concept enough, so it's best to just play around with the repetition. When the film finally takes the logic of the loop seriously, the film lost a little of its enthusiasm and sometimes skims the details into quick montages. The mission doesn't make itself sound that interesting, and it helps that the movie fills it with gigantic weapons and car chases to gloss it over with large scale excitement. There is no denying how awesome the action scenes are, but no matter how indestructible the heroes look, there is still a sense when you don't want them to die and go back to the very start of their checkpoint again. Just the basic suspense these sequences needed. The direction moves consistently, even when the pacing has to go through several loops, its decent editing makes sure these scenes aren't as complex as they supposed to be. Witty screen writing also makes things absorbing.Even the arc of the main characters aren't totally fresh. Cage is basically a man out of luck who is hooked up with various troubles then suddenly meets a much competent companion to develop a team which happens to be the only hope of mankind. In spite that it feels a little stale, how it depicts these misfits somehow becomes the special asset of the film. The actors have given everything these characters deserve. Tom Cruise hasn't been fun lately, his attempt of being a much gruff anti-hero mostly kills the momentum of his last two films. Here, he finally succeeds on what he was trying to do back then, by simply realizing the fact that he is just as ordinary as the people around him, who can get hurt and killed all of the sudden. He also bursts charisma which makes his connection with his co-stars a lot more likable.There could be a larger universe behind the story that needs a deeper exploration, but it's a breath of fresh air seeing a blockbuster attaining more on story building than world building. Edge of Tomorrow is straightforwardly fun, although it's not exactly perfect, whatever the film has glossed over made the experience even better. Especially the ending which is ought to be a flaw, ends with something which turns out to be one of the greatest things I've see in a blockbuster this year. The movie is simply charming, a priceless kind of charm that seems to belong to another decade that we didn't know it hasn't wane out yet. If you don't know what I am talking about then it's alright. Just let me sum it all up for you already: Edge of Tomorrow is a good time at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Intelligence-flavored popcorn,"Try as one might, it is virtually impossible to discuss ""Edge of Tomorrow"" without making at least a passing reference to ""Groundhog Day,"" the 1993 comedy whose very name has become synonymous with - and, indeed, pop culture shorthand for - the act of living the same experience over and over again.Directed with quirky inventiveness by Doug Liman, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" takes this concept into the realm of futuristic science fiction, using the novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka as its source of inspiration. Once again we find ourselves in the near-future, after an alien invasion has all but wiped out continental Europe. Now, it's time for the surviving nations to launch a new D-Day-type assault on the coast of France, this time with super-sophisticated weaponry and armor that may or may not stand up against this most formidable of enemies. Tom Cruise plays a glib and cowardly public relations officer who is only too eager to stand on the sidelines offering encouragement while other young men and women go off to do the fighting, but who is none too happy when he's ordered by one General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) to go take up arms himself. Things don't go too well for Major William Cage in his first foray into mortal combat - he's killed, actually - but through some inexplicable fluke of nature, he wakes up alive in the time before the battle, destined to relive the incident over and over again till he finally gets it right.By far, the best element in ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is the fun and lively performance by Tom Cruise, who gets to run the emotional gamut from paralyzing fear to swaggering bravado, from pleading desperation to raging cock-sureness all within the confines of a single role. In fact it's entertaining to watch how Cage's confidence grows in direct proportion to his knowledge each time he comes back from a trip to the future. Cruise has been at this sort of popcorn-entertainment gig for an awfully long time now, and it's clear he's lost none of his touch. Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton are additional standouts in an excellent cast.Unfortunately, as with even the better forays into big-budget movie-making, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" does eventually hit a point of diminishing returns, as we get flummoxed by the occasional plot hole and overwhelmed by a surfeit of special effects (though the CGI here is, indeed, very impressive). Still, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" has a sophistication and an intelligence rare to modern blockbusters, and it actually manages to mine a surprising amount of humor from its set-up. It doesn't insult its audience, which is saying quite a bit when it comes to the fare we're generally offered when it's summertime at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A not-too-bad future,"Bill Cage(Cruise, charming as always, here in spite of a role that starts out thanklessly grating) is the strawman coward nothing' like those self-sacrificing warriors that we need in order to win! Seriously, it's not new that Hollywood can be years behind reflecting the actual public opinion, but for it to be this aggressive and while pro-war is by its nature on the wrong side of history, regardless of what people think at the time, now, today, with a couple of recent(some unfinished) wars that should never have been started just, wow. Anyway, he has to go with the memorable lot(if it does feel a tad like they were just going through the token minorities to stock the group; in general, characterization is good, albeit no one gets to be all that deep), J Squad, into the Invasion-of-Normandy-like(rather well-done) retaking of France. He gains the ability to repeat the same 24 hours infinitely, and trains as a soldier and works towards victory.Let's deal with the other elephant in the room immediately. Yes, the core concept is doomed from the onset for this genre. There is simply almost no tension for the 110 minute running time(not counting the end credits). Surprise, yes, because we don't know what'll happen. Our protagonist, however, does, and since he feels no fear, neither do we. This does get a lot of its solid humor from the repetition that tends towards not being tedious, but rather imaginative. But yes, sad as it is, this has no real excitement. And it is a real shame. Because the action is fun, well-choreographed, as well as personal and intimate in its perspective, making it chaotic(without ever being overpowering or unpleasant to watch). The gags are great. Still, for ""lots of epic stuff-go-boom with little consequence 'cause that's hard"", this is by no means, yet easily the worst.With a mix of practical and CGI, the FX are another strong suit. The 3D is barely noticeable, though. The look is at points similar to Terminator for the post-apocalyptic war-zone(other spots in this are just abandoned), with Matrix-like Sentinels, without any ripping off of other, better movies. Y'know, other than at least two bits it lifts directly from Aliens(and they're not even related to Paxton he does enjoy himself, and so do we). Little insight into the outer space threat is nothing new, especially these days, but we know so little about the Mimics that we viewers can't ""play along"", such as the few times where our guys hidewhen we, the audience, have no clue how they detect humans!This has a lot of implied violence and a little brutal, bloody, gory and/or disturbing content. I recommend it to those looking for light(outside of maybe the sci-fi) Summer Blockbuster. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing,"Tom Cruise has not up until this movie been accredited for his work in the sci-fi genre. This changes after Edge of tomorrow. Perhaps the best concept of any sci-fi movie in the last 10 years, it actually makes sense for the most part. Acting by Tom is spot on, he hits the right mimics all the time, his reactions predictable, yet still manage to impress and as the movie goes on, they only get better. Emily Blunt is incredible both in the beauty and in the acting department. The supporting cast is pretty good, the 'get on your feet maggot' scenes never fail to make you at least giggle if not laugh out loud. The quality is amazing, the CGI is done perfectly, really crisp. I believe this to be among the best Tom Cruise movies, but it is definitely his best sci-fi movie yet. It's always nice to see new blockbuster movies in the sci-fi department and Tom Cruise has done a splendid job with that. Why this movie grossed less than some other ones that weren't even close to being this good is beyond me. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A nice surprise.,"3 out of 4 stars.I didn't think this film would work. I had seen the previews many times and had no urge to see it. Tom Cruise has had several disappointing action films, like his 2013 film ""Oblivion."" However, critics started giving ""Edge of Tomorrow"" good reviews and I gave it a chance. I'm surprised to say that I liked it.Doug Liman's 2014 film ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is an action-packed summer blockbuster that is actually smart and funny. The film is about an American officer (played by Tom Cruise) who is forced to fight in a an alien battle in France, but he hijacks the alien's power so that every time he dies, he wakes up the day before the battle with the memory of how he died. He can build on these memories and figure out what to do.Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, and Bill Paxton give solid performances and the story has its twist and turns that keep you engaged. The dialogue is very blockbustery. You've heard some of these lines before, some of them probably by Tom Cruise in other movies. I thought the movie was consistent for the most part, but the ending is a little corny.If I didn't walk into the film so skeptical, I may have liked it a little more. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a nice surprise that is actually worth seeing. It's a fun, action-filled ride that will keep you engaged.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Time travel and action combined perfectly!,"Everyday Cage wakes up and has to re earn the support and trust of his comrades, as well as remember what went wrong last time round on the battlefield. Similarly to 50 First Dates, we see how a first impression with a stranger can change a relationship, and with teamwork essential in battle, this is Cage's primary challenge. Rita (Emily Blunt) and Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton) are particularly unforgiving and difficult to win over.Similarly to Butterfly Effect, each time he changes approach, the effect he wants carries the risk of side effects.This film combines time travel and action more effectively than anything I've seen before. The 2 exist in perfect harmony, in contrast to say, the Terminator series, which will always pop up as an all-time great for time travel action films, but uses the time travel only in its openings, then leaves the rest of the films to be action films.Edge of Tomorrow sees Cage (Tom Cruise) repeatedly attempt to win a battle, during which, if he dies, he is re awakened and given another chance. It has right amount of humour to entertain briefly, then let us focus on the serious mission the characters are engaged in.We are cleverly left wondering what we've missed, as the film isn't clear how many attempts at this day Cage makes - what happens on the days in between, has he tried this before, what happened last time he tried? All the while, we also see notable, gradual improvements to Cage's combat skills, thanks to the help of the film's other hero, arguably the ""real"" hero, Rita, in turn improving the film's action. We feel the film has done well to pace out his training along with the character's development.Emily Blunt's performance drives the film, her toughness and focus being a perfect match for her counterpart, a character who begins as a poor soldier. Her no- nonsense approach to Cage is somehow humorous, while simultaneously serious, in terms of achieving the mission objective.Disappointment will be our lack of knowledge of the enemy - the humans don't tell us much about their enemy except that they are at war, and the name they have given them - mimics. The film opens with news reporting the attacks - I would rather have seen the mimic attacks myself than hear about it secondhand from the news reporters, and maybe seen them out of action more than we did.We are also left feeling the character is at little risk - if Cage dies, he starts again, similar to a video game with infinite lives. Less risk can mean less reason to care if he gets it right this time.Must watch movie!Michael NewtonCameras Lie",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Where was Xenu, the dictator of the Galactic Confederacy?","I was looking forward to see Xenu, but he never appeared. I want my money back!The plot is very confusing and the movie full of the typical clichés Hollywood apparently cannot abstain from using, like a beautiful couple with almost super powers that can be blown in every direction without being seriously injured, a tough woman that ultimately falls in love with the man in whom she sees a Jesus-like savior of Humanity, yelling army officers, stupid generals, redneck soldiers, etc., etc.Have you noticed that in recent years in all movies all aliens, similar to vampires and ghosts, make the same noise, when they open their mouth, the same type of scream? Here too. And that they have such mouths, with thousands of teeth, that can never shut? Here too. And that they move so fast you can hardly see them? Here too. In this one they are just a bunch of cables attached to a turd-like body.It's sci-fi, all right, but does it have to be so heavily far-fetched? Apart from that, the movie is annoyingly repetitious.

THIS is why we go to the movies!,"Why do we go to the movies? To be entertained, to laugh, to be thrilled and to be pulled into a situation that we will never experience ourselves. Edge of Tomorrow doesn't just meet the above criteria, it smashes it and is one of the best and most surprising movies of the year.The introduction explains that humanity is battling an alien force known as the ""Mimics"" who have swiftly swallowed most of Europe and Russia. Tom Cruise plays William Cage, a wimpy PR strategist for the United Defence Force, who has never seen a day of combat in his life and is content to sit out as American troops pour into England to assist the fight as mankind gather for one last stand on the beaches of Normandy. After upsetting the top ranking officer, Cage finds himself cast into the frontline of battle in a metal exo-suit. Unfortunately for the troops it is a slaughter and cries of ""they shouldn't even know we were coming"" are heard among the soldiers. Within five minutes Cage is dead along with every other soldier on the beach.Then he wakes up on the day before battle and is again thrust into action before swiftly being killed off again. And of course he wakes up again then dies and wakes up and dies and wakes up and so on and so on. Each time he re-visits the same battle he learns more about the enemy and figures out how to stay alive slightly longer. If you're looking for a comparison it is Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers.Tom Cruise is excellent in the role – it is refreshing to see him as a smug pathetic coward who grows into an action hero – it is his best role in years. Cruise teams up with Emily Blunt – also excellent who clearly spent a lot of time in the gym whilst preparing for her character of battle hardened soldier Rita, nicknamed Full Metal B***h. She agrees to train Cage every day and soon discover they share a connection which just might win the war and save mankind.The action scenes are fast paced and blistering – the Mimics are an unstoppable force of sci-fi cinema and the beach battles are brilliantly rendered by director Doug Liman who has adapted the story from an obscure Japanese story called All You Need is Kill. Although the body count is regularly high, it isn't a violent movie. To the contrary, it is a very entertaining and even laugh out loud funny in places as Rita often discovers the most efficient way to handle Cage is to kill him repeatedly and ""re-set"".Edge of Tomorrow, although not totally original (What is these days?), it is entirely refreshing to see a big budget Hollywood blockbuster that isn't a sequel, re-boot or comic book adaption. It is one of the most enjoyable films you'll experience all year. In short, THIS is why we go to the movies!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
All the fun of a good video game without the grind,"Edge of Tomorrow is a ton of fun in both expected and refreshing ways. Of course, if you pay to watch a film that stars Tom Cruise as an exoskeleton-clad soldier fighting aliens in a time loop that resets the same battle over and over again; you'll surely expect to enjoy a fair amount of quality action and big explosions. You'll get tons of that, but you'll also get some pretty satisfactory intrigue and a generous side of delightfully dark humor.It's no secret that this cinematic adaptation of the Japanese light novel All You Need Is Kill draws inspiration from video games, not only in its concept of ""Live, Die, Repeat"", but also in its style. If you have played first person shooters the likes of Call of Duty you'll feel right at home with the immersive camera work that pulls you right into the battlefield (pun not intended). To be fair, I was also reminded of the legendary Normandy scene from Saving Private Ryan which in turn inspired Call of Duty back in the day (as much as I love video games, must give credit where credit is due).The genius of director Doug Liman is how he takes only good things from these video games, while carefully avoiding all the bad bits. Only Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt (who plays a very Warhammer Space Marine-like badass, sword and everything) suffer the worst parts of replaying a level: unskippable intro cutscenes, excruciating trial an error to inch through overly difficult areas, and grinding to unlock better skills.The audience, meanwhile, gets to enjoy the highlight reel of it all: spectacular set pieces and gripping revelations sandwiched with a healthy dose of humor that usually has to do with Tom Cruise resetting the time loop by dying. Even those who don't like the actor will probably enjoy Edge of Tomorrow if only because they'll get to see him die in several violent ways. All in all Tom Cruise carries the film effortlessly (he's almost 52 now, if he keeps going at this level he won't be old enough for the Expendables until he hits 90) and Emily Blunt gives a good performance too.The movie is very well paced and never gets dull, but it does end up being a little disappointing in the plot department, with a couple of weak and extremely convenient plot devices and some underwhelming revelations. However, you'll more than likely forgive these problems when you get caught in the midst of Edge of Tomorrow's action-packed and surprisingly hilarious cycle of life and death.7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Make this your summer blockbuster choice,This is an very enjoyable well written and entertaining sci fi action movie that works.Tom Cruise plays a reluctant soldier thrown into combat against alien forces in Europe.The story is clever and comes together well. The Groundhog day formula works - it provides laughs and keeps you interested for details. It has in intelligent feel because things add up without unnecessary red herrings. Yet it isn't confusing at all like other time travel shows. You don't feel like you wasted your time watching the different scenarios. Liked the homage to D Day landing beaches theme. Liked the European setting.Tom Cruise does a good job. He doesn't look too aged like some other action movie actors who are past their prime. He can still do the action convincingly and only flashes his trademark grin once. His charm helps make the character likable. Emily Blunt is believable as the soldier. She has a sincere look that is likable. I at first thought she didn't have the appeal to lead a major blockbuster but she is actually very suited to the role. It isn't a romantic movie after all. The fight scenes are well done. With enough variety of scenery and not dizzying like some others.Found this more enjoyable than X Men. Worth watching on the big screen.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Much better then I expected,"This is a great movie which is well-acted, funny, and creative. Its plot revolves around a man put into combat without any training. He's killed within minutes but an alien gives him the opportunity to relive the day over and over in a time loop. He then has to figure out how to stop the alien invasion. Every time he's killed, he learns a bit more and advances a little more. The film offers likable characters. Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise do a great job acting. The film offers some comedic moments to give you a break from the action sequences. This film offers enough surprises and plot twists to keep you entertained. The reason this only gets a 4 out of 5 is because the ending is predictable. The movie tries to play it safe putting in a happy ending but it falls flat because of its choice. Despite this flaw, the film offers enough to keep sci-fi and action fans entertained. Just don't expect it to be revolutionary or decade-defining when watching it and then you should enjoy it. This movie represents what Michael Bay should have been.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly enjoyable,"I have to say that this movie was surprisingly enjoyable. I did have my doubts about it. I always have doubts about movies that manipulate time. I guess one advantage the movie has is that it does not really involve time travel and changing the past to influence the future but ""only"" resetting a day and living it over and over again.The entire concept is of course still totally ludicrous. Even if we forget about the feasibility about resetting time altogether there are just so many things that are wrong with the concept. For example, is time reset all over the universe or just on Earth? Both of those avenues create their own issues further down the line of course. Even if we try to forget these larger issues there are the issue that as soon as Cage altered his own behavior from one repetition of that day to another he would alter the chain of events and what he knew was the events in the previous repeat would no longer be certain in the one he was living right then. Not to mention that he had a longer and longer chain of people to convince on a single day and still get the job done.Okay, enough harping about that. If you manage to lock out all these annoying issues with the story what remains is, as I wrote before, actually a fairly enjoyable movie. It is primarily a science fiction action movie of course and the action as well as special effects are not bad at all. We get treated to plenty of the classical déjà vu scenes were Cage tries to convince people by predicting their immediate future in minute details. Classical and very not innovative but well done and I have to admit that I am a bit of a sucker for these impress-and-surprise someone scenes. On the whole the movie managed to use the basic concept of reliving the day and make it feel reasonable fresh despite it not being a entirely new idea. The fact that the acting was quite adequate and that both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt made a good performance as far as I am concerned of course helped.Naturally the movie builds up towards the climactic battle against the alien central organism and of course everyone (who Cage managed to convince) have to throw in their lives to get Cage in position for the final attack. Personally I liked the ending although I have to say that I was a bit miffed that the writer did not manage to come up with some more imaginative ending scene between Cage and Rita though.Bottom line, an enjoyable movie well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A solid and fresh blockbuster that doesn't feel tired,"It is probably one of the freshest blockbuster for a while. Although its idea is from a Japanese novel, it does not feel bloated and tired like some franchises in this summer are suffering. The movie is what the trailers are suggesting; big-budget action-packed sci-fi movie. But what the trailers didn't reveal is its surprising sense of humour. It feels fresh because blockbusters nowadays take themselves too seriously and this doesn't.The story: It surprisingly starts off without an action scene (many blockbusters like to start off with a big bang action scene). Tom Cruise plays William Cage who is suddenly put in the front line of a battle. The thing is that he is not used to combat. The action starts not long when he is plunged into the battle between alien and human. After he dies the first time, he is brought back to life again. And it goes on. That sums up the first act. Montage of big explosive action scenes and him dying over and over again. Surprisingly it doesn't feel tired and boring. I don't want spoil the second act as the truth is revealed. The third act rams up with an exciting climax. Doug Liman holds up the pacing well, things don't feel repetitive (due to different camera angles too). There is definitely a lot of action. There are times where there are explosions for the sake of a blockbuster movie. But what is nice in these action scenes, both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt have their different fighting styles. Acting wise is fine. It is nice seeing Tom acting out of his comfort zone. Emily does not have to act much except to act cool and swing into action when it is needed. Music wise is fine too.Overall: So far, the blockbusters this year seem tired and rely on their own franchise to sell (Spider-Man, X-Men and upcoming Transformers etc). Edge of Tomorrow may be based on the Japanese novel but it proves to be something fresh on the big screen. It is worth a shot to watch it on big screen. It is a blockbuster that doesn't take itself too seriously and let the audience sit back and watch the action unfold without being overly complicated and bloated.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best movie I have seen all year (so far),"I see a lot of movies and am typically not an action fan really.

"Fantastic entertainment - sleek, witty, humorous, exciting.","People really love to write off Tom Cruise in the press these days, and ""Edge of Tomorrow"" was getting all kinds of nasty publicity leading up to its release: rumours of re-shoots, bad screenings, etc. Whatever his personal beliefs may be, at the end of the day Cruise is just an actor on screen, and this movie is a firm reminder of what an enigmatic presence he is.Now in his early 50s, Cruise is making some of the best action films around, and Edge of Tomorrow is no exception. Based on a manga novel published in Japan, the plot is essentially Groundhog Day by way of Starship Troopers or...something like that.The movie's low point is when it tries to explain too heavily the process by which Cruise's character is able to relive the same day over and over again, because at the end of the day it's just a Macguffin to be able to explore the concept. But the movie's strength is that it places its human story first (as corny as that may sound), as Cruise's character undergoes an emotional and physical transformation. It also features a highly capable female lead, brought to life by the charismatic Emily Blunt. If this were a Michael Bay film, the role would have existed solely as a love interest, but this movie doesn't succumb to such banal (and frankly, sexist) tripe. She is a worthy presence alongside Cruise and is one of the strongest sci-fi heroines since Sigourney Weaver in Alien.Speaking of which, that's the other movie this reminded me of: Aliens. Bill Paxton chewing up the scenery as a drill sergeant probably had something to do with that.I loved this movie. I saw it three times. Despite the press writing it off as a colossal bomb upon release due to its modest opening, it had spectacular legs, and crossed $100 mil domestic. It ultimately wasn't the box office behemoth the studio may have wished for, but people using it as evidence of Cruise's 'failing career' may be wise to look at the full picture: its worldwide gross ranks it as one of his highest money- makers ever.This movie will develop a following on home video and I wouldn't be surprised if they somehow attempt to revisit it one day, whether it's through a lower budget prequel or a spin-off or another manga. Who knows. They should probably leave well enough alone, because it's that rare sci-fi summer blockbuster that has it all: brains, wit and thrills.

Well executed and acted fiction film,"After watching the trailer I thought this film is going to be very similar to 'Source code'. Then I questioned myself why would Tom Cruise star in a film which is similar to a popular cult film. So I've have decide to watch it. Oh boy, I was surprised. It's nothing like anything before.It's a simple storyline or not so simple. A coward major with no combat skills thrown in to a most brutal battle. With no combat skills what so ever he dies there brutally. Then shockingly he wakes up a day before(watch the film to understand why). He realises situation that that war is impossible to win, and he had to die every time, wake up a day before, go to war again and die again until it's won.What I like about this movie is the plot which was the biggest sea landing in WW2, D-day. Everything has been put together perfectly well in to this plot. The emotional depth, humour and the performance from the cast were amazing. Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton probably at their best. Though its the same day again and again, the things slowly starting change every time he restarts the day. The flow and progress is really well put together by the Director. Doug Liman back to his 'Bourne Identity' best.Overall a satisfying edge of the seat action/science fiction film after a while.

Not what I expected,"Good action, obviously great graphics. The concept of the aliens was good both aesthetically and in the plot. Emily Blunt was great, Tom Cruise was okay. Brendan Gleeson's role was almost negligible. Too much humour spread in the movie, and not what I was looking for from the movie. The story was a bit predictable and stale, didn't really draw me in or make me feel much compassion for the characters. Some scenes seemed strictly for humour, with no contribution at all to the plot.

Resetting the day.,"Edge of Tomorrow is directed by Doug Liman and collectively written by Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth. It stars Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, with music by Christophe Beck and cinematography by Dion Beebe.It has proved to be a great decade for sci-f, it seems that for every misfire there are three great genre films to off set the disappointments. Sitting at the top end of the table is Edge of Tomorrow (AKA: Live Die Repeat). Adapted from Hiroshi Sakurazaka's novel ""All You Need Is Kill"", the story has Cruise as William Cage, an American army Major who upon being thrust into combat against an alien race decimating Earth, finds he awakens to the same day after being killed in action. Seeking out Rita (Blunt), the most decorated soldier of the time, Cage must understand what is happening to him and hopefully save the future of mankind.So far so Groundhog Day/Source Code then, but Liman's film never lets up from the get go, frenetic with its action, funny into the bargain, and also sexy, it manages to blend audience pleasing conventions with clever thought and process. There's nothing new in the philosophy on show, and there are regular sci-fi tropes for familiarity of genre, but if you are going to recycle formula then do it with verve and swagger, which this most assuredly does. Boosted by Cruise turning in a good one as an unlikable character who develops into a protag to shout for, and Blunt as a super sexy bad-ass poster girl for the war effort, Edge of Tomorrow ultimately rocks. The science will obviously infuriate those who take such things way too seriously, but as the terror of this particular war unfolds on screen (nifty effects), and we have been bought wholesale into our heroes and their quest, its small failings are hardly worth cocking a snook at. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Above Average Blockbuster,"I don't have too much to say about Edge of Tomorrow, other than I'm pretty pleased. The concept is original and developed, the lead characters are likable and 3-dimensional, the pacing is excellent, and it even stole a few laughs from my theater.Minor issues - I wasn't a big fan of any character besides Cruise's and Blunt's. Their only role was to supply additional guns for the ending. The Magic 2014 Slivers are interesting, but almost too kinetic. Its difficult to grasp how they're beating the humans in combat. Projectiles are fired at Earth's forces, but I couldn't guess how the Mimics are firing them. Cannons? From their mouths? I don't think we ever see them shoot on screen.Its a good action film, fresh and ""smart"" (for the lack of a better word). Its a fine rental.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The most softly presented hard movie,"There is the general stereotype that the script is the base for most of the successful movies that has created an impact on world box- office but there are some movies that has changed such perspective and showed that screenplay could play the prominent role in making that movie a winner.After watching the 2014 sci-fi ''Edge of Tomorrow'' the only think that utter so naturally from our mouth is the silence, yes no doubt that makes speechless, it's very unique and advanced stuff that has been tried in film making till now, though this theme seems to be tried in 2011 ''Source Code'' this movie has very much new things to present to its viewers, to review such a well made movie could be said with very complicated appreciations like – ''the most softly presented hard movie'' the screenplay is the soul of this flick, such a well planned screenplay and the presentation shows the brilliance worked behind such neatly made movie, Aliens invasions are very usual concept used in Hollywood but this movie with its very much unique way of presentation takes it to the next level in cinema making.Bourne director Doug Liman with such a tremendous work will surely move to the top list, Tom Cruise as Major William Cage has done a great work, his on-screen presentation and some of those typical Cruise's style makes his followers to like his performance, Emily Blunt is also appreciable for her energetic portrayal as Special Force Warrior who fight against invaded invincible aliens, it's the entire team that receives a huge applaud for making such a brilliant work.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Movie in Years,"I have to say I was pretty excited about seeing this movie because it is an original story and contains Emily Blunt. What I was not expecting was how incredible it ended up being! Tom Cruise was simply perfect in his role and its the best acting I have seen from him since Jerry Maguire. In essence the movie just flat out rocked!I would say it was the best movie I have seen hands down in quite some years. GO SEE IT and see it in IMAX 3D if you can. It's worth the extra dough! The story is suspenseful, action packed and not too complicated but not boring either. Oh and did I mention Emily Blunt? She holds her own in this movie as just an incredible actress.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Aliens meets Starship Troopers meets Groundhog Day,"Edge of Tomorrow is a science fiction film starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. It had a very clever plot and well-paced action scenes. What intrigued me about it was that it is based on a Japanese graphic novel (or manga) called ""All You Need Is Kill"".The story is about an army officer named William Cage (Tom Cruise) who gets caught up in fighting a war against an elite alien race along side Special Forces soldier Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt). Shortly after dying the first time he is dropped into combat, he discovers that he is stuck in a time loop which repeats the same scenario over and over. Realising they can use this to their advantage, Cage and Vrataski hone their battle skills each time the loop occurs and hatch a plan to kill the aliens and win the war.This concept was very cleverly executed. It was like Aliens meets Starship Troopers meets Groundhog Day. When the movie wanted to be funny with jokes about deja vu, it was hilarious. Even Tom Cruise, whom I normally despise, was very good in this movie, not taking himself too seriously and Emily Blunt was enjoyable as well.I rate it 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent Action Sci-Fi With a Brilliant Ending (No Spoilers),"When I first saw the trailer for this film, I was put off immediately by the groundhog day idea and the irritating electronic music (with the robotic voice) used in it's promotion. Oblivion was rather disappointing for me so I wasn't expecting much at all from this film seeing that Tom Cruise would be in the leading role.Let me just say that even if I was expecting a MASTERPIECE, my expectations would be fulfilled! This movie has it all. Humour, thrills, incredible action sequences and a plot that is both complex and logical. Without revealing any details, I will admit the ending left me confused at first. After a second viewing I put two and two together and realised that it's really quite brilliant. Both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt deliver outstanding, believable performances, keeping in line with the high bar This beats any sci-fi or action film released in 2014. Definitely worth your time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A surprising summer flick that brings action, comedy, and Tom Cruise getting shot over and over again","Tom Cruise's new sci-fi flick, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" tells the story of Major Bill Cage (Cruise), during the war against alien creatures, the Mimics, who are determined to conquer and destroy human race. Cage, being a TV spokesman, tries his hardest to avoid field job, while the aliens are conquering Continental Europe. Things, however, change when General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) of the British forces, sends him to join the storming of Normandy. On the fields, he encounters a special type of Mimic, and successfully blows him up. Yet the Mimic's blood corrodes Cage's body. But instead of rolling the credits, the film begins its main storyline in which Cage receiving a special power of traveling back in time, a day before the storming begins, when he first arrived to his mission. With the help of Sergeant Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), a decorated soldier, Cage tries to destroy the brain of the alien forces, the Omega, in order to prevent human defeat against the Mimics. The film is based on the book by Hiroshi Sakurazaka, All You Need Is Kill, and, in a way, retells the story of the D-day invasion.Director Doug Liman's witty approach is what makes the film successfully tell a repetitive story, without boring the audience. Every time Cage starts a new cycle by getting a bullet in the head, mostly from Vrataski during their training, we can't help ourselves but share a laugh. The influence and inspiration from The Groundhog Day is seen throughout the picture, yet it still brings a lot more action-filed atmosphere. However, what the director was not able to do is develop a real war movie feeling to ""Edge"". There is very little tension before the storming of Normandy begins. Minor characters are poorly developed, which does not allow the viewer to feel for them and have a strong concern about whether they will be able to survive. The reason why General Brigham experiences such strong dislike towards Cage, that he sends him into the middle of the action knowing about his lack of military experience, seems to be avoid or rather ignored. There are also a lot of questions regarding the time travel. After waking up, Cage tends to proceed with different actions, switching some of his choices from before. Yet all the character interactions, and the main action on the beach, remains unchanged from the first time Cage arrives to his mission, disregarding the fact that even a little change in his actions would somehow affect the development of future events, and not keep most of the things the same. Also, the ending makes you question whether or not the film should have taken a classic Hollywood finale.Even with its lack of characterization and uncertain time traveling factors, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a very entertaining, action-filled mish-mash of ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", that delivers laughs and excitement. Also, the score by Christophe Beck (who charmed the world with it's music for Disney mega-hit ""Frozen"") adds it's own thrill, both during quiet and ""bullet-flying-Mimic-killing"" scenes. The film is self-aware and does not try to act as an emotionally serious sci-fi drama. It's a nice piece of summer blockbusters, which once again proves that this time of the year brings major excitement to the screens.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant and mind blowing movie!,"Edge of Tomorrow is sure to be one of the most impressive movie this year for me.There are several things I love about this movie...#1 ""Live. Die.

Very poor adaptation of book.,"Edge of Tomorrow is supposed to be based on Hiroshi Sakurazaka's light novel, All You Need is Kill.The book was mainly about two young adults barely out of childhood fighting a nearly invincible foe with the assistance of older individuals who were devoted to helping them succeed. The main characters are Keiji Kiriya and Rita Vratasky as well as a few supporting characters like Sgt Bartolome (Eurasian, Kiriya's leader, mentor and trainer) and Shasta Raylle (Native American, Rita's armorer).One short term goal was achieved (surviving a single battle) for one soldier, but not the other. The soldier that survived was prosecuted for the effort made on the battlefield and ended up nearly alone as the result of the mass casualties in the single battle.None of this made it into the script which managed to feature Tom Cruise in every scene. Anyone who is a feminist will note that Rita (the Full Metal Bitch) carries a 200 kilogram battle axe in crimson armor while answering to hardy anyone in or out of battle. In the movie she was remade into a damsel in distress with very little of the original back story.What we get is a Tom Cruise action flick that changes (whitewashes and ages) or eliminates characters to ensure that Cruise gets maximum screen time. Kiriya is aged to his late 40's and changed from Japanese to Caucasian. Rita is changed from a 19 year old short flat-chested redhead to the tall blonde 30 year old portrayed by Emily blunt.Instead of the tragic ending of the book we get a dorky feel good Hollywood ending which looks like it was copied from Kevin Smith's Dogma.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This Is What The Hollywood Blockbuster Should Be,"In my eyes, Edge Of Tomorrow is an example of what a Hollywood blockbuster should be. It can be fun and full of action, but it also has an interesting plot that makes you think a little bit, and the acting is really good. This movie shows that just because there's action in the script, doesn't mean that all you include is big explosions in order to pull people into seeing it.This movie has a simple premise. A man ends up obtaining the power to reset the day when he dies, giving him the chance to save the world from invading aliens. Yes, similar to Groundhog Day, but it's really well done. They establish certain events happening within this single day, allowing them to do some creative and often hilarious things when we first see Cruise' character relive those events. He will say things to people before they even say it themselves, try to save people in battle, and even train in order to become a better fighter. It also embraces a lot of humour, in one scene showing Cruise with epic music trying to learn from his mistakes, but constantly getting killed in slightly embarrassing ways, cutting the music, and then cutting back to the same scene but where he does it properly, the music starting up again. It made me laugh out loud many times. The film also occasionally has Cruise say things like ""we tried to do that before and it didn't work"", implying that he had experienced many failed attempts before that we as an audience didn't need to see but we now know. It's really smart about how much failure it shows us versus how much of his progression we see. There are a few twists and turns here that help make the plot more interesting as well. Also, a lot of people complain about the ending, but I think it works perfectly because of all we have been through with the characters.The acting is really good. Tom Cruise starts off as a wimpy guy who really doesn't want to fight and doesn't seem like a hero. But as the film goes along, he becomes braver and more heroic, making you like him more and more. Emily Blunt is also extremely good. What I love about her character is that she is really bad-ass and strong, BUT it isn't done in a ham-fisted, ""girls can be tough too"" kind of way. She is a tough character that just happens to be a girl, and that's what modern movies need. Enough of those silly characters that try so hard to empower women that they seem laughable. Give us REAL strong and tough girl characters like this, and women will feel empower for real! There is also a bit of a love plot going on with Cruise and Blunts' characters, BUT it doesn't over take the film and doesn't feel unnecessary.Perhaps my only complaint is that while the CGI is good and there can be some interesting things to look at, the movie has a bit of the typical Hollywood boring cinematography. Comparing this to Oblivion, another beautiful Tom Cruise sci-fi film that came out recently, it just feels slightly uninspired at time. But it does get the job done and has some really cool action sequences, like the caravan alien chase and a lot of the beach invasion scenes.Overall I would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes sci- fi, action, or anyone who wants to watch a good film that you will have fun with. It's highly enjoyable, well done, and easily accessible. It's exactly what a big budget Hollywood movie should be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wicked Action Groundhog Day,"I saw the trailers, herd the minimal hype and let it sit lonely on my watch list waiting for a non-occasion to actually get around to watching this. Then I was listening to Cracked.com and heard it noted as one of the more underrated and mis-marketed films of 2015.Now having just sat down to watch it I have to say I'm thoroughly impressed. I was glued for the whole film. Quick to move into the action and establish the ground rules. I was also pleasantly surprised by the sense of humour present throughout. I'm not one for writing give-aways. Just know that Tom Cruse and Emily Blunt are great in their respective roles, killer in the action and form an easy chemistry. The supports offer enough entertainment without distracting from the main characters. Best of all the special effects are added in smoothly without dominating the film and give the ""enemy"" life.I highly recommend you grabbing some pop-corn and sitting down for this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Come find me when you wake up!,"As a big fan of these time travel/repeat days over and over again stories, I really thought this would be one of the better movies of the year. Sadly my expectations fell short of that because of a overlong final forty minutes or so. The first part of the film runs smoothly and nice, even with a lot of repeating, however oddly enough when the story starts adding more aspects into the film, it slows down to almost a complete stand still.Directed by Doug Liman, director of The Bourne Identity and Mr. & Mrs. Smith, brings us a really nicely shot film. There is a good bit of high powered action and the scenes look fantastic, even with all the CG involved in the shots. Liman is able to get the most out of his top stars like Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. Blunt really steals the show here and proves she is more than just a beautiful actress. The secondary actors such as Bill Pullman and Brendan Gleeson are acting professionals and deliver another great performance in this film, even with their limited roles.The film was written by Christopher McQuarrie(Jack Reacher), Jez Butterworth(Fair Game), and John-Henry Butterworth(Fair Game), and based on the novel ""All You Need Is Kill"" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. McQuarrie is truly a great writer, and I saw that after watching Jack Reacher, which is another amazing Tom Cruise film that is a must see. However this film felt almost flat for a good chunk of the film. I'm not saying it completely ruins the film, but when you start the film out with a great one hour run of the story and characters, and fall flat in the final forty minutes or so, that is a problem. With a story like this with a lot of repeating for a good chunk of the film, it can be tiring to the audience, however the writers handle that amazingly overall. Sadly when different aspects of the film start to break out in the final forty minutes of the film, it really seems like the last forty minutes was longer than the first hour of the film. The end of the film was a nice touch in an overall pretty good job from these three writers.The film was composed by Christophe Beck, who recently scored the hit film Frozen. Overall Beck does a fantastic job scoring this film. The action scenes are key to deliver amazing music, and I feel he did an amazing job with it. Not one of my favorites scores overall, but he still deserves much credit scoring this film.Overall while this film fell short of my expectations, it is still a must see film without a doubt. The action and overall great story, with amazing acting by the way, puts this film in a nice spot for some of the better films of this year when it is all said and done.Side note for those wondering about the 3D/IMAX. I went to an IMAX 3D showing of this film and thought it was well worth it. Sure the 3D is post converted, meaning not shot using 3D cameras, but the added depth the 3D adds is very nice. IMAX, while so much better if a film is shot using IMAX cameras, was still a great experience. The amazing surround sound and the massive screen does make for a fun experience with this film. So again, if you are wondering if this film deserves the extra money for IMAX 3D, the answer is, without a doubt yes.7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best Movie of 2014... So Far!,"""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a science fiction masterpiece and is easily the best movie I have seen in the last two years. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. There was not a slow spot in the entire thing. I am 48 and I was as giddy as a schoolboy throughout the entire spectacle. I saw it on opening night, and I actually took a group of friends to see it again last night (my friends all loved it too). It definitely held up with my second viewing.I have been a Tom Cruise fan for many years. He continually puts his all into his action scenes and it shows. He seems to get a lot of bad press over the last few years (some of it deserved), but he rarely fails to give the material his all. This movie is possibly his finest hour. In my opinion, it's his best work (and his best film) since 2002's excellent ""Minority Report."" Emily Blunt rocks and kicks lots of booty too. I had never seen her in too much before, but I will definitely keep an eye out for her in the future.If you are looking for a stylish, exciting, and intelligent science fiction/action thriller, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is definitely the ticket.

Mainstream Hollywood can get it right when it tries,"(69%) Mr Tom Cruise's good form continues with this fine, fun sci-fi action flick that could be likened to a video game in the best possible sense of the term. The action set-pieces themselves are really very well done, and like all good big blockbuster movies this is hugely enjoyable throughout, with an interesting, if not entirely faultless plot. The fact that this pulls the Groundhog day trick that as it happens didn't fill every person who went to go see it with a huge groan of boredom is in itself quite an accomplishment. And with Godzilla, X-men and now this, mainstream Hollywood is being quite generous these past few weeks. Yet another big- screen must-watch crowd-pleaser.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Thrilling and Inventive Sci-Fi Action Film with a Clever Twist,"""Edge of Tomorrow,"" directed by Doug Liman, is a sci-fi action film that distinguishes itself with a cleverly executed time-loop premise, thrilling action sequences, and strong performances. This film combines elements of ground-breaking science fiction with the adrenaline rush of an action movie, delivering a story that is both intellectually engaging and immensely entertaining.Tom Cruise stars as Major William Cage, a public relations officer turned unlikely soldier, who finds himself caught in a time loop, reliving the same brutal battle against an alien race. Cruise delivers a dynamic performance, effectively portraying Cage's transformation from a reluctant and unprepared officer to a battle-hardened warrior. His journey is not just physical but also deeply character-driven, adding depth to the action-packed narrative.Emily Blunt is outstanding as Sergeant Rita Vrataski, a skilled and respected soldier who becomes Cage's mentor. Blunt's portrayal of Vrataski is powerful and nuanced, bringing both strength and vulnerability to her character. The chemistry between Cruise and Blunt is palpable, adding an emotional layer to their shared struggle against the aliens.The film's use of the time-loop concept is ingenious. It serves not only as a plot device but also as a tool for character development and storytelling. The repetition is used to great effect, creating moments of humor, tension, and surprise. The screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth skillfully balances the complexities of the time-loop narrative with clear and coherent storytelling.Visually, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a spectacle. The battle scenes are intense and well-choreographed, showcasing impressive special effects and sound design. The alien adversaries are menacing and otherworldly, contributing to the film's immersive experience.One of the film's strengths is its ability to subvert expectations. It blends genres, combining the structure of a Groundhog Day-like time loop with the high stakes of a sci-fi war film. This unique blend keeps the audience guessing and adds freshness to the familiar tropes of both genres.The film's pacing is brisk, keeping the viewer engaged from start to finish. The action sequences are balanced with moments of character development and plot progression, ensuring that the story moves forward even as the protagonist is trapped in a cycle.If there's a drawback, it's that some aspects of the film's lore and the aliens' backstory could have been more developed. However, this does not significantly detract from the overall enjoyment and impact of the film.The soundtrack, composed by Christophe Beck, complements the film's fast-paced and suspenseful tone, enhancing both the action scenes and the quieter moments of the narrative.In conclusion, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a smart, exhilarating, and innovative addition to the science fiction genre. Its clever use of the time-loop concept, combined with strong performances, exciting action, and thoughtful storytelling, earns it a solid 8 out of 10. It's a film that not only entertains but also leaves the audience thinking, a quality that sets it apart in the realm of sci-fi action movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Fantastically entertaining but let down by its last act,"As hard as it may be for some, it's time to leave all that Tom Cruise hate at the door and give whatever doubts you have about Edge of Tomorrow the flick. Despite it being an almost forgone conclusion that in Western markets Edge of Tomorrow will flop (with it likely making its money off the Asian market) missing out on seeing this would be a willing act of missing out on one of the most fun and well filmed blockbusters of the year and a movie that until the last hurdle consistently surprises and thrills.Action genre specialist director Doug Liman does a fantastic job at helming this adaptation of Hiroshi Sakurazaka's novel All You Need is Kill (gee I wish they kept that title) and is wonderfully supported by writing sibling duo Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth along with script touch ups from frequent Cruise collaborator Christopher McQuarrie. That Edge succeeds to the entertainment levels it achieves is due to this perfect melding of thrilling video game like action that throws the audience head first into this futuristic scenario by Liman and the script that was produced. The film fly's the line perfectly between being serious yet not taking itself to much so and I can safely say that the tone of the film produces more laughs and smart scenarios than most so called ""comedy"" films of late. Sceptics that worried of a Sci-Fi like Groundhog Day can rest assured knowing here that the sacred tale of a man repeating a day over and over is well handled here and treated with a fresh perspective. Now while all this should be enough to convince the masses the fact the film stars Tom ""Scientology"" Cruise will still put people off which is a mighty shame considering the man is on as good as form as ever here as at times downright cowardly Bill Cage.Cage is an extremely interesting character for Cruise to play and Cruise nails the role completely in a character that requires him to be all the things from scared, brave through to downright disinterested. In an age of frequently cookie cutter hero's Cage is a nice change up of the formula. Cruise's Cage is a interesting lead and it's made all the better by Emily Blunt as we've never seen her before as Alien slaying master Rita. Blunt and Cruise create a very believable and dynamic duo that acts as a great pairing for the two. While all these elements all combine so well for this thoroughly enjoyable ride it would be wrong to not mention just how disappointing and lacking the films ending is. Without delving into spoiler territory Edge's last act brings down a film that for all intents and purposes was shaping up to be a nigh on perfect Sci-Fi blockbuster, it's a real shame the team behind the film ended up with a whimper and not a bang for the film deserved to go out in style.Stunning special effects, an one key cast of likable players, an unpredictable story and some thrilling set pieces litter Edge of Tomorrow making it a must see big screen experience. With a last act worthy of what came before Edge would have another star added to its total but sadly a weak finale brings down an otherwise perfectly constructed Summer blockbuster.3 and a half re-sets out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Enjoyable Sci-Fi Story,"""Edge of Tomorrow"" is first and foremost an action film. I saw the film in IMAX 3-D. It really does present a spectacle. The special effects are second to none.Like the film ""Groundhog Day"", there are significant humorous elements. These manage to keep the tone fairly light despite the ominous theme of the story.Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt portray likable characters. This makes it possible to invest one's feelings in what happens to them.The most critical part of the film is the story, which keeps you guessing. At one point, I thought it's was going to be really difficult for the writer(s) to resolve the dilemma of the protagonist without it seeming cheesy, but it was resolved without losing any of the film's integrity. That's good writing.The supporting cast does a great job of adding to the experience.

Live die Repeat until it becomes comical,"I loved the concept behind this film; it can so easily be expanded upon almost in a ""Matrix"" kind of way. I remember a lot of the conversations I had about that film when it was first released and I guess when more people get to see ""The Edge of Tomorrow"" those conversations may start up once again. The only problem with these kinds of film is the ""reality nuts"" and sci-fi geeks"" it brings out of hiding who don't get enough explained to make it work. What I mean by that is it is really hard to turn imagination into reality and there always will be some pivotal points missed or simply forgotten as a consequence. I fall into the later of the two nut bags. For me there were just so many holes left unexplained. I don't believe the director had that intention though unlike Nolan who can pull it off so well. So in saying that the film still has its moments of greatness making it worthy enough to give a decent rating. The plot is one that has been done before but not on such a grand scale. Set in a futuristic world the Earth is at War. Major William Cage played by Tom Cruise (Mission Impossible, Vanilla Sky) is a military journalist never seen a day of combat in his life. After refusing to be front and center and report from the impending battle against an alien race known as ""Mimics"", Cage is arrested and knocked out, when he wakes he finds himself in cuffs, his rank has been revoked and now finds himself labeled as a deserter. Cage finds out that now instead of being a reporter on the mission he will now be a soldier, a suicide mission as it becomes apparent. Major Cage dies within 5 minutes of landing after seeing a Special Forces officer Sergeant Rita Vrataski played by Emily Blunt (The Devil wears Prada, Looper) first die. Next thing he wakes up one day earlier and finds the day suddenly repeating Cage seems to be caught in some kind of time loop every time he dies the day starts over There is a lot to give away to the plot if I go any further into the story so I'll leave it there. This is one of those films that we could discuss for years and never come to a solution; I'm sure everyone who sees it will come to their own conclusion which makes it well worth seeing in my opinion. As I stated earlier though I'm a sci-fi geek that needs things to at least work even in made up lands. There is so much that doesn't make sense when thought about, but then there is enough goodness to forgive those mistakes as well. Cruise is actually pretty good in his role not that it's too much of a stretch from other characters he has played before. Blunt does just as well in her kick ass bitch role as well. The majority of this film was shot on green screen which isn't a problem it just means judging its artistic creativeness with cinematography is almost pointless. The CGI of the Mimics I loved though I thought they were great. Not really one for the kids but to be honest I don't believe they would understand its storyline anyway.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Edge of Plainness,"I stepped in the hall with a confidence that i was going to witness a great movie of Tom Cruise after a long time and that it would spice up my holidays....I was so brutally turned down.The movie seemed to have quite a bit to offer in the starting, its just a regular alien fight movie, nothing we have never seen before. Tom Cruise was great in the movie, Emily Blunt didn't quite convince me, neither did Brendan Gleeson. The story seemed quite dim even during the time loop Tom Cruise experiences and it wasn't a very interesting concept either,maybe it had but wasn't properly executed.What could have been a masterpiece for a scifi movie lover turned out pretty plain and boring with nothing much to offer.The movie disappointed me in every way, not even the action, acting or the characters could save this 'movie'. Once again, Tom Cruise is great in it, but it isn't his fault the movie is blah....I walked out of the theaters and realized the movie had nothing to offer and had wasted my money.....Being a sci fi fan, this was a brutal let down,and even though i racked my brains trying to find some logic in the movie...i failed. This might be whats called a time-pass movie, and might surprise many video game fans based on the rating I've seen in IMDb. This is Highly overrated......Disappointed in every way. Saw such a bad movie after a long time. I considered Amazing Spider-man 2 and Godzilla to be average movies, but solely Godzilla seemed like an Oscar winning Film in front of EOT. AS2 and Godzilla combined would be a masterpiece in front of this. I wish i watched 22 Jump Street instead.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best mind trip since Looper,"It's been a long time since Tom Cruise plays the role of a rookie, after Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher, it's acceptable that he's uber awesome from the start, and it's been even longer since Hollywood produces a great adaptation of Japanese popular literature. Edge of Tomorrow, despite spawning from the grimly titled light novel All You Need Is Kill and the poster's morbid catchphrase, is actually rather light hearted, playful and humorous. With gritty near apocalypse backdrop, the movie uses more mass appealing screenplay and, to its credit, manages to make what could be a redundant concept into an entertaining spectacle.The movie's mind bending premise is actually an old one, but it's presented differently in sci-fi thriller, and thankfully it has made the transition to cinema pretty well. Tom Cruise plays William Cage, a military PR officer who is ungracefully demoted and literally dumped on battlefield. It's a fresh look for Cruise as he has always played the role of veteran badass for about a decade now. After his fateful first day, Cage is looped in a vicious cycle; he will unwittingly team up with the actual veteran badass, Rita Vrataski, played by Emily Blunt. Contrasting to the bleak situation, Cruise adds a touch of humor to his character. He is certainly proved as an action star, but the on-screen charisma is more prevalent when he tries to overcome the hardship and fails many times around.Emily Blunt, who has experience in sci-fi genre from her role in Looper, is good choice for Rita. She has a bit of rugged nature from countless battles and she's attractive in her own way. The repeated clip of her doing push-up can also serve as a fitness video thumbnail. Chemistry for these two works for most part as Cage is frantically trying to find answer and Rita has been tempered by battlefield until the point of indifference. Although there could be room for the characters to develop further, they share some good moments and mature attraction. What's really surprising is how director Doug Liman presents the movie in humorous manner, it's consistently funny without being too slapstick. Pacing is really well done, editing helps getting the stagnant premise moves along rapidly. There's also a bit dark humor in recycling death and it's fascinating to see apocalypse concept taken without steroid of grittiness.Edge of Tomorrow is a visual beast, there's more than enough action to rival its blockbuster peers. The motion is fluid and fast, yet it stays focused without spamming slow motion shots. Its extraterrestrial adversaries are looking organically menacing, a mix of liquid tentacle and rabies canine. Overall color tone is bluish gray, a recent trend in this sort of movie. Futuristic equipment are showcased with more plausible technology, but they also incorporate the grandiose blazing aspect one expects from Japanese animation. Everything looks amazing, and fortunately, especially so in 3D.Unfortunately, the final act doesn't carry the same impact as the rest of the movie. It's nowhere near horrible, but it does feel underwhelming and far fetch. Not to mention, the action looks a bit murky compared to the flashy bits of the first half. It could also spend a little more time to establish the relationships between characters, but understandably the narrative requires more time to progress. It's not perfect, but Edge of Tomorrow is an excellent movie that respectfully takes its source and creates an alternate version which is more amusing, thrilling and, I'm going to say it, edgy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Live, Die, Repeat Watch?  Yes Please.","""They say we're young and we don't know. Won't find out unit-ii-l we grow."" This line of Sonny and Cher immediately takes me back to Bill Murray waking up over and over again in the classic ""Groundhog Day"". Similarly the words ""On your feet, maggot!"" gouge themselves into your brain in Tom Cruise's latest blockbuster Edge of Tomorrow.Based on the novel ""All you need is kill"", which was the original shooting title of the film, Cruise plays a really interesting character - William Cage - who begins the film as a cowardly and conniving army media man before circumstances force him to progressively step up find the hero inside himself. The Europe of the not too distant future has been invaded by a bizarre alien life form - the Mimics: a hive like being that breeds like rabbits and quickly overruns the whole of mainland Europe. Clearly UKIP must have got into power by then and shut the Channel Tunnel, since the alien invaders have not yet conquered Britain which stands alone against the enemy.The infantry of the allied forces fight in well-armed mechanised suits, and Cage - much against his will - is strapped into one of these devices and 'parachuted' into the front line on the Normandy beaches: It is rather ironic that I watched this film on the 70th anniversary of when our brave troops did the same thing.Why an aerial invasion would choose to land on the open beaches rather than some nice leafy field more inland is a question perhaps best not dwelt on, but it wouldn't make any difference anyway: unfortunately, the Mimics can manipulate time and they already know the allied forces are coming, resulting in a massacre. Cruise is killed and the film ends. Or rather no, actually it doesn't. From the result of a nice plot twist (no spoilers), Cruise reawakens at the start of the same day and can escape the death that befell him, at least for a little while longer. And so it goes on living up for once to the movie's catchy tag-line - ""Live, Die, Repeat"". As this proceeds, Cage appears, to his fellow comrades, to have almost God-like powers of combat through stunning demonstrations of intuition. I was reminded again of what Bill Murray's Phil Connor's says in ""Groundhog Day"": ""Well maybe the *real* God uses tricks, you know? Maybe he's not omnipotent. He's just been around so long he knows everything."" Cage teams up with legendary fighter Rita, also known as the Angel of Verdun, played by the wonderful Emily Blunt. Rita is the only person to believe in Cage's powers, the reason being (already unnecessarily pre-spoiled via the trailer) that she used to have the same power but lost it. Together they must find a way to dual-handedly end the war.This is a great, albeit not flawless, film. Directed by Doug Limon, of the Bourne films, the pace is non-stop and the story infused with enough thrills, action and humour to thoroughly entertain over its running time, which (and a common complaint from this critic) is pleasingly under 2 hours. Cruise is a star that drives Marmite-like love and hate reactions. And so this is a film that has something for everyone: for the lovers of the diminutive action figure, Cruise is in great form and revels in the chance to step up to what must have been a physically exhausting shoot. For haters of the guy, they get to see him die on stage - - repeatedly! Emily Blunt also shines in her role, and the fledgling, almost reluctant, romance that builds between the two characters is well played. All of the supporting cast, especially the assorted grizzled characters of Cage's J-troop, add variety and depth to the story.The special effects are first rate, with the evil Mimics appearing truly threatening as they emerge suddenly from hiding places under the ground: something perhaps to bear in mind and pre-brief on if you have younger children you want to take.This is very nearly a ten-star film, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. As with any time-travel related film, there are some plot holes that appear when you pick under the skin of the story. This is particularly true of Emily Blunt's character. And the Hollywood ending of the film is rather unsatisfactory and not terribly logical in keeping with the excellence of the rest of the story. But overall this is a film worth you catching at the cinema. A thoroughly good night out.(If you enjoyed this review, please see my archive of other reviews at bobmann447.wordpress.com and sign up to ""Follow the Fad""!).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Definitely worth a watch! 7/10,"Review: I quite enjoyed this movie, which has non-stop intense action/drama from beginning to end. The director added a witty script along with a decent concept which is a mixture between Aliens and Groundhog Day. Although the premise is about a man who relives the same day every time that he gets killed, you do see different parts of that day so your not going through the same thing over and over again. It was cleverly put together by the director, who covered every aspect of the storyline, and I'm glad that it didn't go down the soppy love story route and it just stuck to a full out action movie. The weird looking creatures made the movie intense and dramatic, even though they looked similar to the ones in the Matrix, and the suits were pretty impressive. Basically, it's everything that you expect from a Tom Cruise blockbuster action movie and I personally enjoyed it more than Oblivion and Jack Reacher. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Tom Cruise really isn't showing any signs of slowing down at the ripe age of 52. He still looks pretty good for his age and he's still pulling off a lot of his own stunts. In this movie, he plays his role extremely well because he adds a little wit to the puzzling situation. The chemistry between Cruise and Blunt was great but it could have done with a couple more decent actors as his crew. Its good to see Bill Paxton back in a decent movie but the director should have used Brian Gleeson a bit more. Anyway it's definitely worth a watch for its originality and great concept and I personally think that you will see something different every time that you watch it.Budget: $178million Worldwide Gross: $369millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there action movies about a man who relives the same day every time that gets killed. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Edge Of Tomorrow Review,"For some reason, during the marketing of 'Edge Of Tomorrow' this film seemed to have a lot of scepticism surrounding it, but I was excited for this movie from the moment I first heard about it. You know why? Because I really like Tom Cruise. I couldn't care less about his personal beliefs; he's a good actor so I can separate who he is from the roles he plays. Unfortunately, there are some people who can't do that and will refuse to see this movie just because of Tom Cruise. Those people don't know what they're missing out on, because 'Edge Of Tomorrow' is one of the best original sci-fi movies I have ever seen.It's abundantly clear that Tom Cruise is passionate about sci-fi movies, and he definitely gives some great performances in them. Last year we saw him in 'Oblivion', and now we have him playing Major William Cage, a solider fighting in a war against aliens. Cage soon realises that he's stuck in a time loop of his last day in battle, and whenever he dies he wakes up at the beginning of the day again. This immediately draws comparisons to 'Groundhog Day', but there are also several other movies that 'Edge Of Tomorrow' seems to take inspiration from, with 'Aliens' being one that felt like a huge influence. This film even has Pvt. Hudson himself, Bill Paxton, who gives a very entertaining performance as Master Sergeant Farell. Another reason I was excited for this movie is because of Emily Blunt, and she did not disappoint. I'm always happy to see strong female characters in film, so it's great to see that Emily Blunt has her fair share of badass moments in this movie.Even though 'Edge Of Tomorrow' obviously draws inspiration from many other movies, it never feels like a rip-off. Although its highly generic title may suggest otherwise, 'Edge Of Tomorrow' is actually a very original movie. It's incredibly unpredictable, and unlike other movies within the genre I wasn't picking out plot holes as I was watching. Even though a lot of the movie involves the story going back on itself and repeating events, it never feels boring and is constantly engaging.Doug Liman gives excellent direction, creating a world that feels alive and interesting. The action scenes are especially well directed, they don't rely on shaky cam and the mech-like suits that characters wear create interesting new dynamics in the battlefield and they're a lot of fun to watch. The VFX are stunning as well, there were no moments where there was any noticeable bad CGI.This year had already been a great year for big summer blockbusters, but 'Edge Of Tomorrow' just supports that statement even further. It's an incredibly memorable sci-fi experience that I would strongly recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
-,Nothing much to say but this movie was beyond my expectations so I liked it a lot.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining movie but lacks inspiration. 75%,"It was interesting to learn that this movie was based on a Japanese 'manga' called - amusingly - ""All you need is kill"" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka (it sounds like one of those awful translations generated from a poor web based translation service!). Wikipedia says it was a novel with pictures but then turned into a manga as well. Be that as it may...The story itself is nonsense on stilts - of the kind that a small child could punch holes in the logic of - Earth is invaded by aliens humans dub ""mimics"". For the life of me I can't work out the relationship between that name and what they look like. The aliens look pretty abstract, which perhaps affected the way that I responded to them. They look computer generated and not nearly effective aesthetically as the non-computer generated alien in the movie ""Alien"" or its sequels.The biggest nonsense of this movie is that the aliens have the ability to control time...to 'reset' to an earlier point in time which allows them to learn from their mistakes and thus defeat humanity's best efforts. If you've seen any ads for this movie you'll realise that Earth's hero, Major William Cage (played by Tom Cruise) acquires this time shifting ability of the aliens.Earth's resistance is co-ordinated by the UDF (United Defence Force), of which Major Cage will soon become a servant. The UDF's leader is General Brigham (played by Brendan Gleeson), an Englishman who - early on, especially - has a pinch of Winston Churchill about him. Tom Cruise's Major Cage has a pinch of Jack Nicholson about him early on too. Perhaps it was a choice of the film makers not to have the Earth's defences led by the US...as in it comes across as a 'team' effort to defeat the aliens, not the Americans being the sole heroes...then again, perhaps it's in the original novel too?Whilst set in the future, the imagery is not unlike something you might see in representations of World War I...and its sequel too, perhaps.More than one professional review mentions how this narrative device of time travel is like a video game. I can see that. Perhaps like a 'noob' war video game player, Major Cage is a coward but by a process of constantly dying at the hands of the enemy (that is where the time travel 'reset' device comes in), Cage eventually becomes a worthy opponent to the aliens...a hero, in other words. It's this kind of unrealistic and video game like 'cheat' which makes you wonder how much honour there is in potentially defeating the aliens by dying at their hands so often...but that is how the aliens came to be winning the war against humans in any case.The female character of Sergeant Rita Vrataski (played by Emily Blunt) has an interesting strand to her backstory. It concerns how she got the epithet ""Angel of Verdun"" and how that relates to the aliens' 'long game' as far as their war with humanity goes.The concept of this movie was exciting and interesting to me but despite being an entertaining movie in itself, it didn't scale any greats heights for me. It lacks joy. It is, after all, a boy's own adventure tale. It just did not sweep me away like a movie of this sort should. Ideally you'd want the movie to be rousing and to love the characters. Perhaps one could say it is a little bit sterile in this regards?A sort of similar movie to this is ""Source code"", which I gave 10/10 to on this site. Even though my memory of this movie has faded, I do remember that I loved it. Like ""Edge of tomorrow"", it is not the acting or the characters or the script which win you over. Despite both having this 'flaw', ""Source code"" manages to achieve a level of greatness which ""Edge of tomorrow"" doesn't.Lastly, I'll just mention liking the score for the end credits...after the song. I liked the stereo field created in the cinema...how the music pans from one side to another and creates an aural space.Not a bad movie, in other words...but nowhere near as good as ""Source code""...or the truly great ""Dark city""...or even ""The 13th floor"", which are all similarly 'concept movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Masterclass in action filmmaking,"It's been a few years since this film, but rewatching it now reminded me of how good it actually is and how much I genuinely love it. It's not gritty, or dark, or filled with brooding characters, or the typical atmosphere of many modern sci fi and action films. It's just a lot of fun. The film's greatest asset - aside from two very good performances and chemistry between its leads - is that it constantly keeps a sense of humor about itself. It's funny, and thrilling, and moving, all together.The concept works so well that it's a wonder we haven't really seen it before, although we have, kind of, in movies like Looper, Source Code, Groundhog Day, and a few others. But the script is fresh. I've read the manga, and I eventually read two early drafts of this screenplay, and it's interesting to me how different they all feel from one another and this final product, and that it evolved so thoroughly into something that feels so tightly written.The story is complicated, and yet when watching the movie the plot seems effortless. It's about an insubordinate, cowardly officer named Cage, who is thrown onto the front lines of a war against an invading alien species known as the 'mimics', only to find himself getting killed immediately. Instead of dying outright, he finds himself waking up at a day earlier, unharmed, and about to go back into the battle that killed him. This happens over and over again, hence the tag line of the film, and eventual re-brand into 'live, die, repeat'. He soon discovers that a fellow soldier - the venerated and feared Rita Vrtastky has been stuck in that same loop before, and they begin to conspire a way to harness this time-warp glitch in order to outsmart the seemingly unbeatable mimics.The movie works well for a few reasons. The first is that Tom Cruise plays against type here, and seeing him as a coward is fun, and he knows it. He's great here. We are reminded that Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise, one of the biggest names in the world, but he is totally comfortable messing around with his persona, and crucially, he is a gifted actor. He makes it all work. His schtick is funny, but not flippant. He plays into the emotional resonance of the story, as the fates of these two characters become intertwined in a way that is poignant. Emily Blunt is just as great. The most interesting part of the film, and what makes it better average is that it reaches for something moving; about what it might be like to fall in love and have to lose that person day in day out - and have them lose the memory too. It doesn't resort to cheap sentiment or unnecessary love scenes. The chemistry is there, and we just start to root for these characters, and the burgeoning-then-blank slate romance without them as much as giving the other a peck on the cheek.Overall, it's one of my favorite 'big' pictures of recent years, along with Fury Road - it's a template for how these large scale action things can be really great if all the pieces are in order, if it's tightly written, and you actually feel something too, instead of just being wowed by tremendous special effects.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A good film, worthy of its place as a summer blockbuster","Edge of Tomorrow (the premise of which I will not discuss here, since it is best experienced than described), will seem familiar to some filmgoers, and that is perhaps inevitable. It seems more and more that summer blockbusters are becoming formulaic and predictable, as studios spend more and more money to gamble on franchises they hope will pay off in the box office. Edge of Tomorrow is, however, familiar in a different sense. It reminds me of summer blockbusters that were fun and engaging and, yes, surprising. Even in the final minutes of the film, I was unsure of where it was going, and for that, I am glad. Tom Cruise plays the lead, and does a great job of reminding the audience why Tom Cruise is a star: he walks the line between relatable and extraordinary, and comes off with both a confidence and a dubiousness that fits well with the narrative of the film. The action is also good. One could easily imagine the film becoming bogged town by too many repetitious action sequences, but director Doug Liman does a good job of making the action chaotic where it needs to be and more subdued when that is called for. One of the most pleasurable aspects of the film is its comment on both action films themselves and, in a sense, video games. It uses its premise to both take characters to dark and compelling places, while also providing levity. For that, the screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth should be applauded. Edge of Tomorrow is a good piece of blockbuster filmmaking, and in a cycle of sequels, remakes, and reboots, it is a welcome refreshment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Well-Done Movie With The Worst Title Ever,"I happened upon the original novel ""All You Need Is Kill"" and enjoyed it quite a bit. No, this movie/book is not based on ""Groundhog Day"", it's obviously inspired by computer games where you save your character in case it gets killed. Then you can start over at the save point but have an idea of what to expect.The title of this movie is so vague and uninspired they added ""Live Die Repeat"" to the disc release. Too bad they didn't think of that sooner. The words ""Edge Of Tomorrow"" conjures up images of...uh, nothing. The book title isn't much better, but at least it sticks in the brain.In the book, Tom Cruise's character is an ordinary grunt. But superstar Tom Cruise can't play an ordinary grunt, so they make him a higher rank busted down to ordinary grunt.The action is superb, but the whip-fizzy camera work makes it hard to see what's going on. It's a thing with current movies which I find annoying.That said, it's a good movie and not a sequel or comic book. Kudos to the studio for giving us something challenging and original.

Thoroughly enjoyable,"Last night I've seen this movie and can't wait to write a review on IMDb. Not even a single dull moment through out the film. Theater was filled with full of laughs and claps. Intense action sequences, amazing visual effects, artistically crafted alien creatures, the humor which makes your face hurt, captivating story telling and a slight touch of emotions are pros of this movie.Since it's a sci-fi and time-loop movie I thought story line would be very complex to understand and the repetitive scenes would bore me but as it turns out, the story line is gripping, suspenseful, intense and easily understandable and they took good care of repetitive scenes which are extremely funny.I don't have to talk about Tom Cruise 'cause he's the beast of action movies and Emily Blunt is very good as per usual and great work by Doug Liman.I bet in the last fifteen minutes, your jaws would drop with amazement and I felt that 1hr 50 minutes have quickly passed, I wish this movie is bit more longer and to my surprise the post credits song is super freaking cool.

"Fun at first, but then loses steam quickly","2014. Back when films were still being made in 3D. It makes me cringe every time I watch an old 3D film and see something that was supposed to be hurtling towards the audience out of the screen. 'Edge of Tomorrow' was actually reasonably subtle with most of those, however I suspect if the sequel ever happens it certainly won't be in 3D.I love the die and repeat concept for a film. The best one I've seen was 'Happy Death Day'. That film used it masterfully, having a mystery at the centre of the story, and getting closer and closer to solving it each time. 'Edge of Tomorrow' uses it more like a video game. You die and come back having worked out a little more each time. It was fun at first, but it got old a little quickly for my likely.This is a very well made movie. Top-notch acting, a solid script and everything looks great. It just wasn't really for me. I found it very hard to get invested in the story. It was so unrealistic that I simply didn't care about the outcome. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
So entertaining,"Love this movie so much. So underrated. I think it's because both the leads play characters they are not used to playing. I love Emily Blunt and if for only one reason you see it, do it because of her. First stunt movie and she is awesome. The front planche move she does takes a lot of effort and dedication, she trained for 3 months in prep for this shoot and what a performance.

A surprisingly original film (mostly).,"While the ending (which is a bit uneven and not a good fit for the rest of the movie) and some features throughout are somewhat reminiscent of older sci-fi action movies (reminding me of the Matrix Revolutions), the parts of the film where he has to live the same events over and over again and repetition of the battle sequences in the middle were what made this movie especially entertaining. Emily Blunt did great and so did Tom Cruise, who I would argue is one of the best action movie stars spanning decades!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
like,"At the end of the film that all the gentle eyes, like the deep sea. The rhythm of the film is particularly well grasped, repeated time node, similar segments, but will not make people feel boring. Male owners never willing to go to the battlefield of the civilian staff, over and over again in the death of the training of powerful skills to win, laugh and tears can not help. The woman refused to open her heart because she saw the loved one die three hundred times, and the male owner faced the same dilemma, knowing that some things were futile but still hard to do, the cabin coffee scene most let people feel the warmth and fate helpless, victory and emotion are especially difficult and should be treasured. Over and over again and a little bit of breakthrough ending, the whole film is always the game of the brave, there is no fate of welding death, only those who refuse to work hard.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Rearing  Starship Troopers with Groundhog Day and introduce Aliens to the playpen.  It blasts the doors off.  WITH GUSTO!,"From the offset of hearing about this film in trailers, posters and here in fact, in IMDb. It did look like something I thought would be seen, forgotten and in a bargain bin in HMV within the first year of its DVD release. Boy was I wrong.The story is, Tom Cruise plays Major William Cage, As high ranking official in an army who are faced off with a seemingly unbeatable Alien race, intent on conquering Earth. Cage, who has never seen a single day of active combat is stripped of his rank for insubordination by his commanding officer and thrown into a barracks where he, and a ragtag platoon of soldiers (including an ever charismatic Bill Paxton) are thrust into what appears to be a suicide mission. Meeting the Alien army head on in combat. After being killed, Cage inexplicably awakens the morning of the battle with his memories and combat experience intact. Enlisting the aid of Emily Blunt, hardened Special Forces Soldier, Rita Vrataski. Cage begins a race against time quest to win this battle and bring victory for the Human Race.The thing with Edge of Tomorrow, going in for me, was that it took me by surprise in a completely unexpected fashion. On the surface, Edge has the face of a Sci Fi action thriller that, I later found out was an Americanizd version of a manga entitled 'All You Need Is Kill'. The image of a sword wielding Emily Blunt on the poster is a reminder of the comic bookish stylisation that runs throughout. The mech style armour suits worn by the characters and the high tech weapondry holds a certain sense of Iron Mongers vs Plantlife in the organic looking Alien creatures.In short, Edge of Tomorrow is a new cult favourite of mine and I'm sure is up there in may other lists too. Around half way though, the film introduces an almost supernatural feel with the biological implications of the Aliens DNA on Cruise's character, causing the day restarts. The ways that the script handles the template of the 'Groundhoggish' support is innovative and continues on throughout by upping the stakes. Just when you think the films plot strands have run their course, a new route to the end goal is discovered and is implemented and evolved. Much the same as Cage, who begins the film as a cowardly deserter and is forged by Rita with a hammer into a Warrior who carries the weight of humanity on his ever growing shoulders.A true, new age sci fi epic. Not to be missed! -FP",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An entertaining and action packed film that was nothing special in it's idea,"I loved the alien concept and the fear of the destruction of the planet. Humans vs the invading forces, I will never tire of liking this thing kind of movie. However, come on! Yeah, he dies and wakes up again and again; yeah I get it but really how many times do you have to show that. That seemed to be the case for 95% of the film. It could have been executed a lot better if he'd died less and there had been more of an actual story to get involved in. The concept of defeating the alien mother to destroy all has been done before as well as the idea of waking up again and again to experience the same day. I don't feel 'Edge of tomorrow' brought anything new to the table at all in this relation except some upgraded special effects added into the mix. For me this film was entertaining while relaxing at home but but overall not a particularity great film. I'm happy to have seen it but won't be watching it again anytime soon.......",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

'Groundhog Day' meets 'Starship Troopers',"Doug Liman's 'Edge of Tomorrow' nearly maximizes the full potential of its clever and deceptively simple premise while avoiding many of the potential pitfalls that might have otherwise derailed it. The result is a fun, rousing piece of Summer popcorn entertainment that actually gives us something fresh in an era of endless sequels and reboots.Tom Cruise has become a rather polarizing figure in recent years due to his personal beliefs, but his energy and charisma remain second to none. He's in nearly every scene, and he alone takes the film to a level it would not otherwise have reached with any other actor.I had a few small gripes. The aliens remain faceless and without any clear agenda, and though rendered impressively, their rather busy design and movements make them hard to track during the movie's many action sequences. The ending may also not sit well with everyone. But overall, 'Edge of Tomorrow' may turn out to be this Summer's freshest and most fun popcorn flick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A pastiche of familiar Hollywood tropes,"Like the repeating time travel story device this movie uses, we have seen this before in Star Trek episodes, Groundhog Day, etc, etc. Sure, Tom Cruise gives us another charismatic performance, and there is a flavor-of-the-month hot blonde half his age to fuel our naughtier fantasies. There are explosions and special effects and technologically advanced yet mindless space aliens.But does any of that make it a good movie? Not to my admittedly limited capacity brain. I suppose I could go into listing plot holes and asking other rhetorical questions about how and why what happened, but things like that don't really interest me that much. What does interest me is dramatic impact and thought provoking situations and dialog. Sadly, there is little of that present in Edge of Tomorrow.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Child friendly Hollywoodized adaptation of a book.,"I read ""All you Need is Kill"" before i watched the movie. For those who do not know, the movie is based on ""All you Need is Kill"". While the original and the movie features similarities, it is only in the character idea and parts of the story. Compared to one another, the Movie is a dumbed down Hollywoodized family friendly smudge filled with predictable everything. I do get that change is necessary at times when going from novel to film as you have to fit a the in a 3 hour-ish format. The changes in this film however is absolutely bonkers, removing almost everything of its originality and charm.

Try try again Tom Cruise,"I enjoyed this ""play it again ... and again ... and again Sam"" science fiction flick and I think most science fiction fans will also enjoy it. The stars do a good job, the visuals are excellent and the story is interesting and makes you think. There is humor and thrills and even a bit of a love story. Most reviewers compare it to ""Ground Hog Day"" but ""Source Code"" is more comparable. At some point it gets hard to keep track of ""he remembered"" and ""she remembered"" and why, but by then you have bought into the basic premise so you don't really care if you can't figure it out. In some ways Tom Cruise reminded me of the young Alec Baldwin in ""Hunt for Red October"".

The movie is overrated,"The whole story becomes apparent after first 10 minutes. After that there is nothing very attention grappling in the story neither any unguessable twist.

Edge of Tomorrow(2014),"A soldier fighting aliens gets to relive the same day over and over again, the day restarting every time he dies.Director:Doug Liman
Writers:Christopher McQuarrie (screenplay by), Jez Butterworth
Stars:Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, Bill PaxtonDoug Liman (director) and his editor makes the learning process funny, engaging, yet they never forget to show the audience how horrible war really is--aliens or not . The action scenes are fast paced and blistering - the Mimics are an unstoppable force of sci-fi cinema and the beach battles are brilliantly rendered .Tom Cruise is excellent in the role - it is refreshing to see him as a smug pathetic coward who grows into an action hero. I have to hand it to Cruise he is a talented actor and stunt man.Stunning Emily Blunt matches Cruise every step of the way as his trainer and love interest. Blunt who clearly spent a lot of time in the gym whilst preparing for her character of battle hardened soldier Rita, nicknamed Full Metal B***h. She is truly impressive in this film. And who doesn't enjoy a dose of Bill Paxton? ! The rest of the cast is excellent, the music rocks. Must say the special effects are out standing and quite effective.Edge of Tomorrow, chocked full of action, explosions, aliens weapons , it is entirely refreshing to see a big budget Hollywood blockbuster that isn't a sequel, re-boot or comic book adaption. Great popcorn cinema, really enjoyed this one !",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It covers familiar ground and is a bit gimmicky, but it still very much succeeds on its own merits","Soldier Cage (Tom Cruise) is forced to fight on the frontline (very much against his will) in a war against an alien race. Cage gets killed during the battle, but also discovers that he is able to reset the day every time he dies. Cage struggles to convince his fellow soldiers of what has happened to him and what he knows, but manages to find an ally in another soldier Rita (Emily Blunt). With their different skill sets they set to work in trying to defeat the alien race once and for all...Edge Of Tomorrow has clearly lifted its central concept from Groundhog Day and set it in a post apocalyptic era where humans are fighting aliens (which again is nothing new). Aside from the gimmicky nature of the plot, I think what makes the film work is mainly down to the way the story is constructed and how it all unfolds; at first we're in the same boat as Cage - confused about what is happening and searching for answers. It soon starts to become like a puzzle and each time Cage dies and resets the day we are gradually able to start piecing things together and more and more of the story starts to unravel and step by step Rita and Cage get closer to achieving their goal.One thing I did find interesting about this film was the way Cruise's character is written; usually when watching Cruise's films he usually has leading man status and generally plays characters with a degree of heroism. At the start of the film, he is something of a pacifist and is very much against violence (which is not something we're used to seeing from Cruise in a lot of his action films). Of course, he becomes skilled later in the film, but it was interesting to see Cruise play a character that had been written in such a manner. On the other hand, Emily Blunt's character is the opposite; tough as nails and rather no nonsense in approach - she remains this way throughout which was something of a blessing as I was worried that we might have had another 'sappy romance' on our hands.Edge Of Tomorrow is a good looking film with some neat special effects and director Doug Liman keeps everything tight and focused; naturally it's a rinse and repeat approach, but new developments to the story are realised on each repeated day so it never becomes dull (this was part of the reason that Groundhog Day worked as well). Out of the supporting cast then it's only Bill Paxton who's really given anything to do and he once again puts in a very strong performance.Despite the fact that this is Groundhog Day set against the backdrop of war with an alien race, Edge Of Tomorrow still manages to hold its own and is an entertaining film with a decent story and enough elements for it to be able to stand up to scrutiny on its own merits. Not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but an enjoyable film nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"a little disappointed, but on a higher level","I went into that movie with higher hopes. I was not hyped, but i had heard more good than bad about it. I was also in the mood for an action film that evening.Now how can i say it without sounding overcritical... . The action sequences are good, but pretty much standard for high budget movies these days i think.The alien design is one aspect that i disagreed with. Comparing the possibilities today (meaning CGI and near unlimited creative freedom) the alien design was outright mainstream/boring.The two protagonists were fine. Tom Cruise did an average acting job (average as in - what he usually does) and the supporting characters were alright but a bit flat and/or stereotypically one dimensional.Aside from Cruise - there was very little character development present (which makes sense considering the nature of the time-line) - and his development again ... was fine.The solution was another part of the movie i disagreed with. It was uncreative and felt like such plot solutions occurred in many movies before - and even more computer games (which the movie oddly reminded me on) All in all, i would give that movie a score slightly above average.

It's bizarre a little.The savage thing was that he had to start over when he was killed. There's no save point. So, the fortune hardly worked. He had to grasp the action petterns of the enemies and the others completely. You know, it's a basis of the video game!If you're tired of playing, you can get the rest.

Sci-fi action Groundhog Day!,"See Edge of Tomorrow? The best way to explain it is in using movie maths. I'd put it as Independence Day plus Groundhog Day equals Edge of Tomorrow. You'll find other various combinations elsewhere but that sums it up. So if you like those two movies then you'll likely like this.This Sci-fi etc centres around our hero (played by the very impressive Tom Cruise) reliving the moment trying to battle the alien invaders. Assisted by the ever impressive Emily Blunt, this film wraps together light romance, action, thrills and spills quite well. As soldiers on a mission for the sake of the earth itself, they usually have one chance. In this, Tom Cruise is a soldier who like in a computer game can start again to retry in a Groundhog Day manner. Sounds corny but works.Despite the interesting premise, it does get repetitive at times and despite liking it I got tired of it all at points. It's good but you'll either buy into it or it will drive right by you.Enjoyable Sci-fi fare, original and different. You'll like it for the Sci-fi, story, action or acting.

Never though it could be worse than Oblivion....,"Not sure what is the problem with science fiction these days, but truly, most fail.That is not right, Matt Damon's one was pretty strong and decent, but the rest....On par with Oblivion, Edge Of Tomorrow is a bit about clone, the only different is that it is not humans that are clone, but time.This repeating time thing certainly doesn't appeal to me (the same scenes being projected multiple times is truly boring). But there is worst.The plot of this movie is non-existent, the first thing we know is that a man not fit for combat is sent to the frontline for an obscure reason. Since it is in the future, fighters are wearing can of robotic skeletons, The robotic things looks very stupid by the way. It felts like more of a weight burden than an advantage, which is lame.Tom Cruise trying to look like a virgin gun welder is not bad, but it is a bit guffaw.Oh I didn't watch all the movie, but I guess 20 minutes give me a good idea of what will be the rest (since everything repeats almost identically for the reminder of the movie).Almost forgot, we have no idea what is the foe doing or purpose.Si",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Smart, funny, thrilling, entertaining - an exceptional sci-fi action flick","I was given a vague idea of what to expect before I sat to watch, and that notion turns out to have been exactly on point. Exposition in the first twenty minutes or so ranges from squarely suitable to somewhat boorishly overdone. Thereafter, the movie becomes utterly brilliant. I expected I'd enjoy this, but I really can't overstate just how outstanding 'Edge of tomorrow' is.The proliferate action violence is exquisitely well done, sharp and vivid, and thanks to the central conceit, represents more variety than one tends to assume of such fare. Between the top-notch, seamless CGI, and physical fabricated elements like the exosuits, plus every conceivable stunt and effect, the action is honestly, surely, some of the best that science fiction has had to offer in recent memory. The creature designs are rather stunning, and look fantastic as they appear; we know very well what the cast is capable of, and still Tom Cruise handily impresses in this Action Hero role, and it's even more of a pleasure to see Emily Blunt in the same light. The pacing is tight and fast, something I'd readily criticize under most circumstances. Not only is it generally appropriate here given the hard-changing violence, however, but given the quick clip of time repeating it kind of feels altogether necessary.On top of action-adventure thrills the repeating nature of the narrative means there comes an inevitable point where protagonist Cage tires of the whole charade, and becomes perfectly practiced in every possible situation. There's some gratifying, meaningful drama and character moments to surface amidst everything else the title has to offer - and more so as the tale takes more turns than I expected. Hats off to screenwriters Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth, for they've taken a familiar premise and twisted in wonderfully entertaining, satisfying new directions. That includes, not least, the emphatic comedy that characterizes a considerable portion of the runtime as Cage dies again and again. Tremendous intelligence was poured into every detail, from the biology, organization, and capabilities of the mimics, to the mechanism by which time repeats, to what Cage learns of everyone and everything around him by reliving the same day over and over. 'Edge of tomorrow' is stuff to the gills with information that is imparted curtly but naturally in these atypical storytelling circumstances, and which would nevertheless take much longer to earnestly dissect and expound upon.To whatever extent there are facets that we've seen before, by and large this is smart enough and clever enough to make the best use of the more ordinary bits while otherwise flooring us with everything else the feature has to offer. And in all other ways it's terrifically well made, with rock-solid direction, cinematography, sound design, and editing that in my opinion goes above and beyond, with thanks to James Herbert and Laura Jennings. Production design, art direction, costume design, hair, makeup, props, weapons: what here is not top caliber? What else would one expect of such an enormous, big-budget project? Not to take for granted all the hard work of the crew, for this could not be possible without them. Still, for all the excellence this carries with it, all the laughs and thrills, it's the writing that's the primary backbone of all else to follow, and the screenplay could scarcely be any stronger. Favorable reviews and word of mouth built significant anticipation for me, and all the same the end result well exceeds what I ever thought this might have been. It's a sci-fi action flick that is without question among the very best of what modern genre cinema can claim in general, and specifically, it's supremely shrewd in blending action and comedy, and communicating a wealth of information without getting bogged down in it, and without ever losing sight of the need to just be Fun. I don't know if I'd say this movie is absolutely flawless - but at this level, the distinction hardly matters.

Way better than expected!,"Tom Cruise has been known to fight aliens before, but while his latest effort mimics the best of the genre (Aliens, The Matrix) while adding aspects of history (the Normandy from Saving Private Ryan) and glimpses of comedy (Groundhog Day), this movie ultimately feels pretty damn fresh. Time loop films can easily get repetitive, but director Doug Liman is too smart to give us the same scenes over and over. They all serve a purpose, move the plot, add humor or turn out to be frustrating dead ends for the protagonists. Once you accept the admittedly random reason behind the premise, there is no way not to enjoy this fun ride. This is all too cleverly crafted, breaking the chain of formulaic repetition with a pretty smart script, genuinely thrilling action sequences and impressive special effects. Following the kind of flawed heroes you enjoy growing invested in really helps, of course. Cruise-haters can instead take joy in seeing him getting killed over and over again. But make no mistake: We haven't had a grand-scale alien invasion thriller that worked so well in years, while knocking the audience's socks off.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Never an 8/10 movie,"Sorry but I completely disagree with all of those 10/10 ratings and wish people would review films appropriately. This is my first review and previously I used IMDb's user reviews as my main source of wanting to know whether to go and see a film or not.Nowadays, I try to ignore the 10/10 and conversely 1/10 reviews and look for the intelligent, thoughtful insights - skipping over the clearly fan/non-fan submissions.This is getting harder as more keyboard warriors have a written 'voice'.For what it's worth, this is an average, at best schlock, with Tom Cruise going through the obligatory TC motions. This is not original or thought provoking but it is fun. To give it 10/10 is to say it is better than Interstellar or Star Wars (original, groundbreaking sci- fi) is really to miss the point of our responsibility as general reviewers.I had fun, I enjoyed it immensely. The special effects we really good, but of course with all sci-fi there will be plot-holes. I like plot-holes as they give you a chance to formulate your own opinions and second guess the writers. Emily Blunt (who was impeccable as always) putting TC out of his misery time and again was a really enjoyable sequence.But let's get back to being informative, to give others a chance to decide whether we want to see something or not. The IMDb is not a fan-forum, it's for us to give our honest opinions.Sorry, a little rant but I couldn't hold out any longer.P.S. is it now a mandatory for TC to have a shot of him riding a motorcycle in every film now?

He is then trained by Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), a well-known, battle hardened soldier who crosses paths with William Cage.From start till end, the pacing of the film does not drag in a way that exhausts it viewers due to overuse. Use of certain elements in a film (e.g. balancing the right amount of exposure of characters or conflicts in a plot) can give viewers a hard time to follow the story, especially with a ""restarting-the-events"" the MC experiences. However, in each restart the further the story goes, there has been a significant character or story development, otherwise, some shorter restarts are just for gags.Overall, it is a very thrilling action packed story with just the right pacing, progression, and development of its characters while they manage to find a solution to end the conflict and save the world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A foreseeing movie,"I have seen this movie about 4 years ago... Well it needs to see it at least twice to fully understand the whole sense of the story and all the stuff around.By the time the world and global situation have moved alot. What was once sheer sci-fi is now nearly a reality.And there may be a higher meaning or sense for why things this movie show haven't yet occured. Consider the planet Earth is under patronacy. Patronacy of other galactic civilization. Let's call them Civilization of Silver Disks. And that's their presence on Earth is reason why such events - as galactic invasion of any foreign race, or any other global destruction (huge asteroids, gamma blast) have not yet occured during mankind's history. Consider Erich von Daninken has been right and we are not alone on our planet - for at least several thousands or tens of thousands of years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Favourite Film,This is my favourite film ever made. The best of the best in the genre. The story is fantastic and the application is phenomenal.

Best Written Movie I've Seen in a Long Time!,"Love Tom Cruise, hate Tom Cruise - you have to admit - the guy picks good movies to be in (well, most). I'll even go so far as to say he does what he does (e.g. action, hero, etc.) really well! He hit gold on this one. What makes this movie fantastic is the writing. It's nothing short of genius. I haven't seen writing like this for a very long time.You have to appreciate the thought that went into this movie. Cruise is the A-LIST actor that ties together this great effort on so many levels. You kind of wonder if ""Oblivion"" wasn't his first attempt at science fiction greatness. Sadly, that movie fell short. Happily, he didn't give up and gave us this solid movie to enjoy for a long time to come.Writing A+, Special effects A, acting A, overall A!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Heavy on Plot, Light on Heart","THE GOOD: Engaging and interesting plot. Great action scenes. Top notch visual effects. The movie delivers on intensity and excitement.THE BAD: Almost no character development. Really, the main character is not even developed. We know he's an officer who gets shanghai'd into active duty on the front line. We also know he has the power to reset the day when he dies. We never learn anything else about him. Zero, zilch, nada. Equally undeveloped is his ""relationship"" with the secondary character played by Emily Blunt. There was some awesome potential for an excellent character there, but all we got was a companion he could run around with completing their missions. There was one brief farmhouse scene where they spent like two minutes trying to show that there was a relationship developing, but it wasn't enough.By the end of the movie I haven't been made to care about these characters, only what happens in the story. That is a HUGE script writing mistake, IMHO. This movie could have been spectacular if it had deep, interesting characters but as it turns out, it was only an above average action flick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Surprisingly Entertaining Movie,"What a way to end a semester of good science fiction by watching Edge of Tomorrow. I remember seeing the trailer for this film during a Godzilla IMAX 3D screening, thinking it looked too much like a video game and that it looked so cliche. I didn't grasp the fact that it was like Groundhog Day meets Terminator, and the result was a great deal of fun.First of all, this film has a good casting of leads/important characters, such as Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt (who I had not seen much of before this film) and Brendan Gleeson (who I LOVE in In Bruges). Some people hate Tom Cruise, and to that I say give the guy a chance with great roles under his belt such as the lead in Rain Man and a role in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia which rightfully earned him an Oscar nomination. Emily Blunt is amazing as the ""full metal b****"" who does not give a damn, knocking out a soldier who nearly calls her by this name. And as for Gleeson, I guess he doesn't really do much, but I like him.Going back to Tom Cruise, he plays an iconic spokesperson who has a high military rank, though he is more involved with advertising and wants little to do with actual battle. He is a coward who is sent on a journey to prove himself to be a very brave soldier.The Groundhog Day aspect to this film provides a lot of laughs, focusing on funny ways that he dies early in the film and the way Emily Blunt's character kills him over and over again.The premise of the film is kind of a stretch to believe, but then again this is science fiction; you either buy it or you don't. Cage is lucky enough to kill an ""Alpha"" with a claymore before dying, and the alpha's blood is splattered onto him and gives him the ""ability"" to reset the day as he dies. These aliens are unlike any we have seen before in alien invasion movies, looking like giant sea creatures with a type of ""hair"" that looks like the features of an anemone. Alphas are very rare amongst them, which are the ones that can reset the day, and their motivations are unknown, but they are a force that the world is fighting against. This is a very ""us vs them"" film promoting global unity to fight a threat.You'll be pleasantly surprised with this gem; watch this film.8/10*This review is from 2015.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Groundhog Day meets Transformers...,"For a reason that is unclear, even for the most hardcore sci-fi fans, major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is trapped in a time-loop (a la Groundhog day) during a war against an alien race who wants to take over the planet.With such a premise and a budget of $180,000,000 you can expect some serious visual effects in this one. The movie doesn't take itself too serious and that's a good thing, so you can expect some funny moments too.Surprisingly enough there is also a romance in it. And I mean it is a surprise because Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt are far from a matching couple. There is no romantic chemistry between them as simple as that.Anyway. Overall it's a fun movie. I usually rate these with a 7 but I'm rating this particular movie with 6, because of the unsuitable cast/couple.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Bill Murray declined on Groundhog day 2, Tom Cruise to the rescue!","Andy McDowell was easier to get to third base with than with Emily Blunt. I also greatly miss the cut scene where an utter bonkers Tom Cruise drives into a chasm holding a groundhog in his arms.Seriously, someone REALLY REALLY wanted to make the exact same movie, but was forced to do a science fiction flick in the same vein instead.After a truly atrocious intro of a Red Alert level TV news montage with an inexplicable 25% Israeli coverage of a middle European interplanetary conflict......comes decently executed action madness spiced with some humor and just a tiny romance. Maybe if the aliens weren't these pulsating pieces of mess i would like the movie, but i hate their ultra speedy hyper detail trendy ""nano robots clinging together to form a big mass"" look.I was really looking for a scene in which Cage (Cruise's character... somewhere in an alternative universe there's a film with Nick Cage playing someone named Cruise) points out among one of these timelines that the woman was coldly leaving him to rot on the battlefield... but that never came. I get that Blunt's character is this supposedly plausible female Rambo focused on the mission, but... Rambo was rescuing his war mates, you member?By the way, you apparently loose this re-try ability after 24 hours, so... how did she gain this incredible massive respect among soldiers, FOR A WELL EXECUTED LIKE HALF DAY?.. give me a break.The countless re-tries of different scenarios are well edited so the movie stays relatively engaging and fun, however i must say it is nonsense to repeat everything so precisely so you exactly know what comes at the N+1th corner. So many variables, very silly. The movie handles Cage's day like it's a precisely scripted modern FPS video game, and he is re-trying the same level over and over again till he becomes godlike at it.I've checked out the 3D version of this... WOW. No shock 3D failed again, this thing does nothing to be suitable, the constant cuts ugh it becomes very tiring after a minute.The supporting cast did a good job as a whole.I can't recall a single beat of the music.I gotta say i couldn't really grasp the ending... but i don't care to re-watch to get it more unfortunately. Not sorry for wasting the time once though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Sci-Fi-Movie with great Cruise & Blunt!,"Watched ""Edge of Tomorrow"" for the fifth time today. For me, this is one of those special films and one of the best with Tom Cruise.The story itself has not reinvented the wheel in 2014, because both the ""daily greets the groundhog"" principle and the theme of alien invasion are no longer new. However, the implementation, presentation and narrative structure are simply great. The pace is fast, it never gets boring and there is always something happening. And despite the repetitions of the day, I never have the feeling that it gets tiring, because completely new scenes are shown again and again from each day and real 1:1 repetitions are rarely shown. The variety is at a very high level.Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt are an incredibly great screen couple. Tom Cruise goes through a really well-played evolution here from coward and deserter to war hero. And what I also like very much: The film gets along without a sex scene, which is a real rarity nowadays. It's great that the studio and Doug Liman dared to do that.Sound-wise, the film (Blu-Ray) is on a very high level. The spatiality is great and the soundscape is powerful and clearly defined. The low tones are also really strong and go very deep.Visually, the film has also been staged great. Here and there the cuts could be a bit slower and sometimes a more distant camera angle would do the film good, but that is criticism on a high level, because visually the film still makes a lot.I also really like the soundtrack. The epic sci-fi battle music is just great.And the ending of the movie is just great!As for a sequel, I would really fucking love to see it. However, I would also be afraid that the great ending could be ruined and that the sequel might not reach the genius and quality of the first part. So I would also be satisfied if they just left it at the one film. But to see Emily Blunt and Tom Cruis together again would also have a lot of merit. Unfortunately, however, I recently heard that Warner Brothers in all its ""wisdom"" is now planning a series, and without Blunt and Cruise. If that were to happen, the studio would once again prove how dumb, stupid and dimwitted they are. Just a sap as far as decisions go. Sorry, just had to get that out.For me anyway, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is an outstanding film that I like even more with each viewing. I'm really glad to have experienced the film in the cinema back then. Repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awful. Don't waste your time.,"Such an enormous waste of time and money that could be given to Scorsese or Tarantino to make another movie. The plot was confusing and unimaginative, the acting was not bad but not great either. Tom Cruise has never appealed to me other than his Mission Impossible movies and Edge of Tomorrow sealed the deal for me. Something was off from the beginning. From the first five minutes I knew that something wasn't right with this movie. The writing was unrealistic and laughable and the camera work reminded me of some homemade go pro videos. This could've been a great movie if it were presented 10x better, and it pains me to know that the director will probably never redeem himself after a blunder as big as this one. The special effects and CGI weren't even that great, and they needed to be for a movie about aliens.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It's a clever movie but they shouldn't make it so big,"The story is smart. This kind of movie can work on a smaller scale. They shouldn't make it on such a big budget, causing difficulties to break even. It's unfair when people focus on the failure of box office, not the film itself.However, this movie is far from perfect. I think it's even not entertaining enough. Here is why-1.It's clever, maybe too clever for general people to catch the crucial points. Many people understand the live-die-repeat thing, but have no idea about how the time loop works, the structure of alien society, or the difference between Alpha and Omega. That's why so many people consider it boring.2.Tom's role is too far away from the roles he used to play, causing a lot of confusions. His acting is good. But this is not enough for a character building. Screenwriters should do more on the leading role's character development, not leave everything to the actor.3.Most other actors are completely wasted. I can't believe such a good writer who worked out so many decent supporting characters (in both Valkyrie and Jack Reacher) cannot do it this time. It's a shame. I really start to worry about MI5 now...(I didn't worry and had enough confidence in Christopher McQuarrie until I watch this film)Anyway, it's a nice film. The story telling is smooth and soooo clever. Tom is as good as always. Emily also did a great job. I think many people will enjoy it, although I'm a little disappointed as a TC fan.（Not a good enough film for such a crucial time in his career, it's good, but not good enough)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Edge of my seat at times too,"After aliens invade earth Major Cage (Tom Cruise) is thrown into battle resulting in his death. However he is reborn again, and killed and reborn again, starting the same day over and over from the same point. He meets Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) and each time they live and die they gather more knowledge about how to beat this insidious enemy.I love the idea, it's like a military Groundhog Day. The action is great when it starts and the aliens are almost similar to some seen in Star Trek. Although there's some pretty ridiculous scenes in it, it is a Sci Fi movie and the idea of fighting the aliens and time travelling already sets the bar so anything else is minor. There's not much fluff thankfully: most of the film concentrates on the development of the story which means you become immersed with the story and then the characters, pretty easily. The CGI is almost flawless and the characters really seem to be part of the scene instead of appearing in front of a CGI screen. It's a very easy watch but does of course raise some thought about time travel and the way the military is run.Cruise and Blunt do a great job as the leads although much as I love Brendan Gleeson I can't see why he was cast as General Brigham.All in all this is a great action Sci Fi and I choose a solid 8 for it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Tom Cruise science fiction film- a thrill ride.,"Edge of Tomorrow is a great big budget science fiction film which blends in the concept of groundhog day with an alien invasion setting. Tom Cruise has totally accustomed himself to leading multi million dollar films and he is totally at ease here playing Major William Cage who is thrown in the midst of a battle with aliens. Whilst in battle he is killed and infected with the Alien's characteristics which makes him repeat the entire day as soon as he is killed. Ably supported by the talented Emily Blunt Edge of Tomorrow is a shining example of a thought provoking film which also happens to be hugely entertaining.

"War, Time Loops, and Alien Invaders: Unraveling 'Edge of Tomorrow","""Edge of Tomorrow"" is less of a time travel movie than an experience movie; that statement might not make sense now, but it probably will after you've seen it. Based on Hiroshi Sikurazaka's novel ""All You Need is Kill,"" it's a true science fiction film, highly conceptual, set during the aftermath of an alien invasion. The fierce, octopod-looking beasties known as Mimics are controlled hive-mind style by a creature that seems able to peer through time, or rupture it, or something.Tom Cruise plays Major William Cage, an Army public relations officer. Cage is a surprising choice for the role of hero. He's never seen combat yet inexplicably finds himself thrown into the middle of a ferocious battle that will decide the outcome of the war. The film begins with Cage en route to European command headquarters in London, waking up in the belly of a transport chopper. The rest of the movie may not be his dream per se, but at various points, it sure feels as though it is.The world is wracked by war. Millions have died. Whole cities have been reduced to ash heaps. When Cage meets the general in charge of that part of the world's forces, he's told he's being sent right into this movie's version of D-Day and is to report for duty immediately. No amount of protest by Cage can halt this assignment, and soon after he joins his unit and learns the rudiments of wearing combat armor (this is one of those science fiction films in which soldiers wear clumping bionic suits festooned with machine guns and other weapons), he dies on the battlefield. Then he wakes up and starts all over. Then he dies again and starts over again. He always knows he's been here before, that he met this person, said that thing, did that thing, made a wrong choice and died. Nobody else does, though. They're oblivious to the way in which Cage, like ""Slaughterhouse Five"" hero Billy Pilgrim, has come unstuck in time.Cage's only allies are a scientist (Noah Taylor) who believes the creatures are beating humanity through their mastery of time, and Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), an Audie Murphy or Sgt. York type who's great for armed forces morale in addition to being an exceptionally gifted killer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An exciting sci fi movie,"I couldn't come up with a more interesting title, but yeah I really enjoyed this movie! I'm not actually one for sci fi films, so hopefully this speaks volumes that this is a decent one to watch.The plot is something that we are all used to by now (won't go into depth, I'm sure you know by the description it's basically like Groundhog Day), but this sci fi take of it is really engaging and entertaining more importantly. Something I enjoyed was that it jumps straight into it, there's no boring moments or filler scenes, it literally thumps you right into the mix of what's going on and the situation. Sure, there is an argument for a lack of character depth, but I don't particularly think this film needs it due to the nature of the plot. The film doesn't go on longer than it needs to which is also a huge plus.I also massively enjoyed the action scenes. The fighting of the aliens, the guns and the extravagant and really well made CGI really make this out to be an exciting and thoroughly entertaining watch. The performances of both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt were great, sold their characters really well and managed to create a feel of empathy towards them throughout. I love how this film doesn't take itself too seriously either, little moments of humour added into the serious plot worked so well and it never over complicated itself which I find a lot of sci fi films tend to do.I've banged on more than I should. Only real negative I have is that I thought it was a little too predictable going into the back end of the movie, but it really doesn't take anything away on how good it is and how entertaining it is either.A solid 8/10 from me today.

Super cool and filled with action,"High-octane and thrilling sci-fi action film that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.First and foremost, Tom Cruise's performance as Major William ""Bill"" Cage is impressive. He brings his signature charisma and intensity to the character, portraying Cage's transformation from a reluctant soldier to a skilled warrior with great skill.The film's premise of a time loop, where Cage relives the same day over and over again, adds a unique and exhilarating twist to the action genre. Director Doug Liman's storytelling keeps the audience engaged as Cage navigates through the relentless battle against alien invaders.Emily Blunt's portrayal of Sergeant Rita Vrataski is equally commendable. She embodies the tough and fearless soldier, providing a perfect counterbalance to Cruise's character. Blunt's performance adds depth to the film's exploration of courage and sacrifice.Edge of Tomorrow excels in its action sequences, showcasing intense combat scenes and impressive visual effects. The film's fast-paced and adrenaline-pumping battles are a major highlight.The film's humor and wit, often stemming from Cage's time loop predicament, provide moments of levity amidst the intense action. The clever writing adds an extra layer of entertainment to the overall experience.Edge of Tomorrow is a rollercoaster ride of excitement, blending sci-fi elements with military action. It keeps viewers guessing and invested in the characters' journey throughout the film.In conclusion, Edge of Tomorrow is a gripping and adrenaline-fueled ride that delivers on all fronts. With Tom Cruise's compelling performance, Doug Liman's masterful direction, and the film's inventive premise, it's a sci-fi action film that stands out among the rest.If you're a fan of exhilarating action films with a twist of time-bending elements, Edge of Tomorrow is a must-watch.

Maybe too well since one of my issues with this film is the fact that I wished they got more screen time.I did not expect to like this film so much but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Really good!,"Edge of Tomorrow is a fun action packed sci-fi movie with a little bit of romance added in. I had decided to see this movie since I heard it was great and now that I've seen it, I can confirm it was great. The connection Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise had was something special. The acting from Tom Cruise was great as always as he repeats the same day over and over. The story is great and never feels boring when you're watching.
I would see this because it's a fun movie with great acting!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Edge Of Tomorrow Senselessly Violent Science Fiction Film,"Watching ""Edge Of Tomorrow,"" you realize the contempt Hollywood media conglomerates have for their audience. The central character of this movie, Major Cage, spends most of his time getting killed. According to the idiotic premise of this movie, because he was dowsed with an alien creature's blood the first time he died in battle, Cage will now time loop back to an earlier time whenever he is killed. So, like a gamer playing a video shooter game, Cage goes back to the start of the game if the enemy finishes him off. On and on, Cage gets killed, getting more proficient at avoiding wipe out as the movie progresses.The reason Cage is in battle is bizarre. He is an American major handling PR who tells a UDF general that he is an American officer and he will he not follow UDF orders to land with soldiers attacking the Micmics, the alien enemies. When Cage says he will make life hard on the general if he tries to send Cage into battle, naturally, the UDF general reduces Cage's rank to private, falsifies records to show Cage is an attempted deserter, kidnaps Cage and sends Cage into battle as cannon fodder.Co-star Emily Blount plays a character called the ""Angel of Verdun."" That's it for her character development. J squad, the unit Cage joins just before the attack, is made up of the necessary social representatives: a woman, a black guy, a fat guy, some whites including one who looks Hispanic. The less said about Bill Paxton's Master Sergeant Farell, the better. All put on spiffy mechanical exo-skeletons before being sent to battle.Comparing this movie to 1997's ""Starship Troopers"" shows how far Hollywood has sunk in its creative abilities. True, Edge's director Doug Liman doesn't hold a candle to Starship's director, Paul Verhoeven. More than that, though, is how ""Starship Troopers"" showed a team effort, no single character being Superman, and how Verhoeven and his writers threw in an anti-military subtext.""Edge Of Tomorrow"" is an ugly and unreal movie that glorifies fictional soldiers getting obliterated in battle, repeatedly. This movie has no heart and it makes no sense. I've read that Brad Pitt turned down an offer to star in Edge. After starring in ""World War Z,"" a really ugly and stupid movie, I can understand why Pitt did not want to double down with another junk science fiction movie. Tom Cruise's previous movie ""Oblivion"" is Shakespeare compared to ""Edge of Tomorrow."" As you may have guessed, I am no fan of ""Edge of Tomorrow.""",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I sometimes got the feeling that I was on the battlefield. Lots of shaky camera shots, which fitted the situation. The downside I noticed was the irritating same sequence that plays over an over again, with Rita pulling the trigger.I'm Maybe traditionally but where were the feminine energy from Rita? She is cute but when I look at her body, all I see is a woman with no muscles and no strength to carry all that armor she had on her. She even takes on all ""manly"" qualities.

Groundhog's Day on Steroids,"I've never been a big fan of Tom Cruise, but he was exceptional in this film. I love the transformation of his facial expressions, at the beginning he is scared and ready to run, but by the end he is confident in every action he makes. The biggest thing that really helped the movie stand out is Emily Blunt. She Highlights Tom Cruises role and brings out funny moments in the film. I love the humor mixed in with action, with a splash of romance. The filming was great and the CGI was not over done.

Still great even 10 years later,"""Edge of Tomorrow"" combines the relentless pace of action films with the intricate plotting of the best time-loop stories. Directed by Doug Liman, this film stars Tom Cruise as Major William Cage, a PR officer turned unlikely soldier who finds himself reliving the same brutal battle against an alien invasion over and over again. Emily Blunt stars as Rita Vrataski, a war hero who becomes Cage's mentor and ally in figuring out how to use his unique situation to their advantage.The concept of repeating the same day might sound repetitive, but ""Edge of Tomorrow"" keeps it fresh and engaging with clever variations in each loop. The chemistry between Cruise and Blunt is palpable, adding a human element to the high-stakes sci-fi thrills. Each loop builds on the last in a crescendo of strategy and character development, making the audience root for the protagonists not just to win, but to evolve.Visually, the movie is a spectacle. The action scenes are tightly choreographed, and the alien designs are both original and terrifying. The use of special effects enhances rather than overwhelms, creating a believable world of chaos and war.The film's major strength is how it balances its complex concepts with accessibility and humor. It doesn't get bogged down in explaining every detail of its science fiction premise, which keeps the pacing brisk and the story engaging. The humor, often derived from Cruise's character's repeated failures, provides a necessary relief from the intense action and darker themes.In conclusion, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a smart, exhilarating film that not only explores its unique take on the time-loop genre but also redefines what can be expected from a blockbuster action movie. It's a must-watch for fans of science fiction and action alike, providing both thought-provoking scenarios and heart-pounding excitement.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Edge of your seat,"A scared-of-the-war soldier (No, that wasn't a typo error) is forcibly thrown (literally) on a battle field where he has to play tag with aliens and bullets and you can guess the rest. Along the way he meets a girl whom everyone fondly calls ""Full-metal-B**ch"" (That wasn't a typo either). Together they are put in a time loop where they play the same day again and again and again until the director decides to call it a day (No extra points if the movie ""Groundhog day"" comes to your mind).Based on novel ""All you need is kill"", there is nothing much for the story department and to some extent the screenplay department can relax a bit for the same reason. But flavoring it in the Hollywood crucible with some star-powered cast, this movie has essentially become one of the best sci-fi in the recent times.Before you decide to vote against me, let me make my stand clear. I go into a sci-fi movie not expecting an Oscar performance or a classy screenplay. On the contrary I expect entertainment with some good-to- recall moments that will make my money worthwhile. Did the movie tick all the boxes, YES.Tom Cruise, as we all know, is Hollywood's go-to-guy when it comes to saving the world. Be it the Russians (in MI-4) or killer drones (in Oblivion) or the ""mimics"" (in this movie"") he has seen them all and killed them all. When the Academy decides to offer an award on the ""most kill category"", we know who the front-runner is.OK, enough deviations. Edge Of Tomorrow (EOT) is nothing short of an adrenaline drive which doesn't take itself very seriously (which is a good thing) with its own light-hearted moments (For ex. The hero must die each time to reset the day and guess who does it most of the time). Though this dries up a bit towards the end, the story fills in the vacuum with touch-ups from the CG department.Some of you might be confused towards the end as to how the story shaped itself. But then it's the writer freedom to decide how his story must end. So, that's forgiven.Edge of Tomorrow: Will leave you on the edge of your seats.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This gripping and well-acted science fiction film leaves an impression.,"Edge Of Tomorrow is definitely one of the must-see films of this year. Director Doug Liman infused this military science fiction story with his distinct action style. But as good as the film is (I can even call it inspired) it's still dragged down by Liman's lack of artistry and his inability to create a clear narrative. Edge Of Tomorrow is a good-looking film. At times there's some very impressive imagery, especially in the action scenes. Shots of Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) come to mind. But, overall, there isn't much to look at except for the metal suits. The film starts out rather slowly as the viewers are introduced to an alien threat (the Mimics) and what is being done to fight them. William Cage (Tom Cruise) is there from the beginning, though his character becomes interesting only later. The story begins developing once Blunt is on screen. She's magnetic in her role as Rita and clearly the best feature of the film. This is one tough woman that one can actually admire. She looks like a heroine but, in addition to her determination, Blunt also brings some vulnerability to the character. This shows that there's more to her than being a soldier. I didn't really expect Blunt to deliver a good performance. Her previous work in Hollywood films didn't show much. I haven't seen any of her work in English productions. Edge Of Tomorrow is an American film but for some reason it takes place in England and in Europe. Almost all of the characters are English. The film clearly reaches its peak in the middle. That's when the best most exciting action occurs. That's when Cruise's character begins to develop. That's when the story gets most interesting. The Japanese light novel All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka was the inspiration for Edge Of Tomorrow. Surprisingly, except for the main characters, there aren't many changes from the light novel. The story is basically the same. William Cage (Keiji Kiriya in the light novel) gets caught in a time loop where he wakes up one day in the past after having been killed on the battlefield. Cruise is playing against type here because his characters is a coward for most of the film. The repetitious concept is used as a means of exploring the protagonist's deeply flawed nature and reluctant push for self-improvement. As for the other characters, I could care less about them. Time is spent on developing them too, but they're not a memorable or even a likable bunch. Because of its action and sense of urgency Edge Of Tomorrow is similar to The Bourne Identity (2002), which is another Liman film. However, it also contains some humor, making it seems similar to Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) too. It's better than both of those good-but-flawed films, so it's a summer release that I definitely recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Quality sci-fi with arguably the greatest film star ever,"Version I saw: UK cinema release (2D)Actors: 7/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 7/10There is a case to be made for dubbing Tom Cruise the greatest star in film history. Not necessarily the best star, and certainly not the best actor (although he can be very good on his day). For three whole decades, he has played lead in among the biggest blockbusters of the year, and yet is also willing to set aside his ego on occasion to play villains and other deeply flawed characters. Alongside the action hero parts, I could point you to Tropic Thunder, Collateral, Magnolia and Interview With the Vampire for a truly rounded filmography that stretches right up to the present day.Edge of Tomorrow is one of Cruise's less outright heroic roles. Although he redeems himself by the end, he begins as a cowardly liar, and proceeds largely by an almost endless parade of failure, slowly developing into a badass.Comparisons have been drawn between Edge of Tom and several other films. In particular, Groundhog Day and Saving Private Ryan are the plot precedents regularly drawn upon, with overtones of Starship Troopers. The story seems to me a direct retelling of the D-Day landings as a science fiction adventure, notably being released within days (and in some countries, on the very day) of the famous World War II offensive's 70th anniversary. It seems this has not been focused on much by reviewers or the film's own PR, but I applaud it as an attempt to make history accessible to young action film fans.The plot device of a single day endlessly repeated while only one person is aware is now a well worn one, but EoT proves once again that there is more interesting material to explore. The set-up, it has to be said, doesn't entirely makes sense, but the focus is more on the implications than the causes.It has to be said that the plot trajectory has more than a few clichés about it, revolving around an everyman who discovers an extraordinary ability, trains under a master and exceeds the master to save the day. However, when the master in question is played by Emily Blunt, an expert in characters with a little bit of grit and a share of concealed vulnerability, I am happy to let it go.It's a shame they couldn't call the film 'All You Need Is Kill', the title of the Japanese light novel on which it is based, but I can see why the producers decided they needed something a bit less 'engrish'. This is very much a Tom Cruise film, and that is the way it was sold.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Interesting,"Edge of Tomorrow is a highly engaging and thrilling sci-fi action film that delivers on every level. The fascinating concept of a time loop is handled with precision, creating constant tension and excitement as Tom Cruise's character is forced to relive the same brutal battle, learning and adapting each time. What makes it even more interesting is how it explores the complexity of alien life forms, portraying them as unpredictable and truly formidable. The combination of smart storytelling, gripping action, and clever twists makes this a must-watch.Overall a very good movie to watch and bend your brain.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The fun kind of ridiculous,"Last night I spent $1.50 to see Tom Cruise scurry around in his newest blockbuster sci-fi action comedy extravaganza Edge of Tomorrow. Let me tell you, $1.50 is the perfect price to pay for this film. Now, don't interpret that as me saying this movie sucks. It doesn't. Is it worth the usual price of admission, which here in Los Angeles can be as much as $20? No. Is it worth the theater experience, though? Yes, absolutely. Edge of Tomorrow is loud, shiny, and extravagant, and it definitely entertains for two hours.Edge of Tomorrow takes place in the midst of an alien invasion as the humans of Earth try to battle back a vicious race of bizarre looking aliens called Mimics. Cruise plays Cage, an officer who finds himself stuck in a time loop where he repeats the same day over and over a-la Groundhogs Day. This day just happens to be the day that a beachfront attack on the aliens would go horribly wrong, resulting in an absolute slaughter on the human side of the battle. When Cruise meets up with Emily Blunt he finds out that, because of his G-Day syndrome, is the only chance civilization has at stopping the Mimics. The only catch is that he has to keep dying so that he can relive the same fatal day until he pretty much gets it right.The easiest way to label this movie is by calling it a mix between Groundhogs Day and Starship Troopers. If that logline sounds absolutely ridiculous, it is because Edge of Tomorrow is absolutely ridiculous. It's an absurd concept carried throughout by absurd exposition driving an increasingly absurd plot. By about the halfway mark it should have been very easy to start hating this film, but it's saved by one thing; it's own self awareness. Edge of Tomorrow knows how silly it is, and it embraces that right off the bat. It hits the ground running with a good sense of humor and a protagonist who is intentionally a complete pussy. Of course, reliving the same day over and over allows Cruise's character to come into his own, and the transition from wuss to hero is pretty well done.This film sets itself up well for non-stop action. It only takes about 20 minutes for us to get our first taste of combat in an epic D-Day inspired beach battle. Then we of course repeat this battle again and again, making for a battle sequence that technically lasts the entire movie. How many films get to say that?This unfortunately sets the film up to be a little long winded, and I felt like a solid 15-20 minutes could have been shaved off to save some of the alien battle fatigue I was feeling by the third act. I was really enjoying Edge of Tomorrow from the get go, but after a while Tom Cruise getting smacked around by aliens and robots gets a little tiring and repetitive. Given the film's premise it's probably not totally fair to call the film repetitive, since that's sort of the point, but other similar movies like Groundhogs Day proved that you can still keep a repetitive movie fresh, and for most of the film Edge of Tomorrow is good about this. By the third act the film did something really smart. I won't give away any specific plot points but it definitely raises the stakes, keeping the plot freshly exciting, but the on screen action was more of the same.Edge of Tomorrow starts significantly stronger than it ends, but that doesn't stop this film from being a solid sci-fi action movie. It's a memorable popcorn flick that I can admire solely for the fact that it's not a sequel, prequel, remake, or reboot. I always enjoy original sci- fi, and Edge of Tomorrow is no exception. Especially given how dreadful this looked from the trailers, I give major kudos to Edge for keeping me entertained enough for it's two hour runtime.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
