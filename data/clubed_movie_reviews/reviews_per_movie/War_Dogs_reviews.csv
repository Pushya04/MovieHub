Is that even legal??,"Hangover/Due Date director Todd Philipps makes a film base on the true story of young, entrepreneur gun-runners David Parkouz and Efraim Diveroli who managed to secure a ridiculous contract to supply arms to the afghan army via the pentagon.Miles Teller plays the struggling and ambitious David who bumps into his childhood buddy Efraim played by Jonah Hill who is somewhat of the opposite, a loose cannon, fearless and a little trigger-happy. Now, Efraim has found himself a little niche in the market, the market of arms dealing and strikes up small deals with the US military. David needs a job to support his expecting girlfriend, the stunning Ana de Armas who looks a little like Penelope Cruz only more beautiful and has one of those exotic accents. Efraim sees an opportunity for David and the two team up to what leads to the deal of the century for all parties involved.Now, the film has plenty of other film references most notably Scarface, even one of the promotional posters is a respectful nod to the DePalma/Pacino's film. But it's actually Lord of War Efraim is a huge fan of in real-life and it's probably more like Lord of War than Scarface, yet it has tinge of Pain & Gain, another crazy true story movie. Maybe it's Miami? But it has that vibrant and funny yet serious storytelling style that makes the film almost unbelievable and shocking.The rest of the cast does include Bradley Cooper who also produced the film, playing the harden, borderline war-criminal, pretty much the Branson of the arms market and someone you don't really want to be messing with. There's Kevin Pollack playing the bankroll and an awesome cameo of venture capitalist playboy millionaire Dan Bilzerian.It's accompanied by a great soundtrack with tracks from 50cent, Beastie Boys, Iggy Pop, UB40 and CCR but the awesome score threw me completely thinking it was Harry Gregson-Williams or Steve Jablonski, no, it was Cliff Martinez with those ambient sounds.The film is highly entertaining, funny in parts but this is not a comedy; its perfectly paced with some great scenes like the duo gun-running across the triangle of death and some nice camera work. However it's not to epic portions, not that it should put anyone off watching this, it's still a very watchable and enjoyable film and I don't think they could have done it any better.Running Time: 8 The Cast: 8 Performance: 8 Direction: 8 Story: 8 Script: 8 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 9 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 for a slick story, good editing and a great score/soundtrack to boot.78% 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It's good. Better than ""fine"" but not ""great"".","Right off the bat the best part of this movie is the acting: Teller and Hill have great chemistry on screen. Jonah does a particularly good job at playing the ""guy you love to hate"". I can't attest to the faithfulness of their portrayal of the real life people since I don't know anything about them. The rest of the cast does a great job as well.The marketing for this movie was, unfortunately, deceitful: the trailer made it out to be this upbeat, funny, over the top comedy - which it's not. In reality the movie has a much slower pace, not a lot of situational humor and is certainly not filled with hilarious quips (the bulk of which are in the trailer). This is not to say that the movie was bad or not at all funny, it just wasn't what I expected (and I am sure I'm not alone).My final critique will go unnoticed for the majority of viewers but I found it personally offensive so I have to report it: some of the movie takes place in Albania, only the set for Albania is actually Romania. Which is fine, I understand that they probably did this for practical reasons and as a Romanian movie goer I just have to accept it (we all recognized it immediately though). However, at some point in the movie an ""Albanian"" woman says something, only she says it in Romanian. This may not seem like much but it totally took me out of the movie and ruined the experience for me. I find it completely unacceptable that they could not hire an Albanian to say those few lines. The two languages might seem interchangeable to the rest of the world, I am sure, but that was very much NOT the case for me and everyone else in the theater.I am a paying movie goer as well and I expect to be just as entertained as everyone else. This is, of course, not the first time that I've seen this in a film. But when a producer does something like this it shows me that they don't respect their movie, so they can't expect me to.My rating, however, is not based on this final bit of criticism. I gave it a 7/10 for slow pacing and lack of humor, which is the opposite of what I expected.I'd still recommend it, just don't expect to be blown away.After watching it for a second time I decided to change my original rating from 7/10 to 8/10, mainly because the acting is just great and I respect the fact that the movie made me think about it and made me want to see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"war is a business, and we're the commodity","I don't know enough about the original story to determine the accuracy of Todd Phillips's ""War Dogs"", but it's an enjoyable movie. The tricks pulled by David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli just go to show that the people in the business of weapons have no principles (even violating arms embargoes). They're out to make money by any means necessary. To be certain, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq proved quite profitable for weapons manufacturers. The mistake that Packouz and Diveroli made was getting caught.It's not a masterpiece, but it does a respectable job showing the degrees to which these types go to enrich themselves. A very slimy world indeed.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Better than I expected.,"War Dogs is based on a true story where two twenty somethings sell arms back to the US government. Jonah Hill and Mills Teller put up a great performance, they made the story very appealing. The storyline had plenty of connections with Scarface, from locations to tag lines. It was a good movie with a great cast. Definitely worth watching.",,Anonymous,Biography
Entertaining true-life tale that doesn't have the nerve to go all the way,"There were many shocking and quite unbelievable stories to emerge from the U.S. during the Bush/Cheney administration, but none were quite as fantastical as the overwhelming position 20-something minor-league arms dealers Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz found themselves in. Their tale is utterly preposterous, but entirely true, although events naturally have been dramatised for the film. Like something straight out of a culture-clash comedy from the 1980s, Diveroli and Packouz landed a $298 million Pentagon contract involving over a hundred million rounds of ammunition. The mishandling of the deal and the pair's subsequent falling out was covered in a Rolling Stone article by Guy Lawson, and later in a book by Lawson entitled Arms and the Dudes.David Packouz (Miles Teller) is a pot-smoking massage therapist working in Miami, Florida, dividing his spare time between his girlfriend Iz (Ana de Armas) and trying, somewhat unsuccessfully, to flog the high-quality Egyptian bed-sheets that he has invested in to retirement homes. At a funeral, he encounters his old best friend Efraim (Jonah Hill), who has made a success in Los Angeles trading in arms on eBay. They rekindle their friendship, despite Efraim proving himself to be a unpredictable loose-cannon, and David eventually joins his chum at his new business venture AEY. With the war raging in Iraq, the government has set up a website offering contracts for weapons and military equipment. David's job is to pick up the crumbs; those small orders the big companies ignore.There are, as Efraim informs David, a hell of a lot of crumbs, and the two are soon making their fortunes while Efraim indulges in everything from prostitutes to copious amounts of cocaine. The two grew up loving Brian De Palma's Scarface (1983), and imagery from the film adorns AEY's office walls. The same unquenchable greed that possessed Al Pacino's character seems to drive Efraim also, and it isn't long before you can see the inevitable downfall on the horizon. Director Todd Phillips, on the back of those terrible The Hangover sequels, seems to be intent on making a semi-serious film, and wisely takes inspiration from some of America's great dark-side- of-the-American-dream cinematic works, such as De Palma's aforementioned drug-lord saga and Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990). But, unlike Adam McKay's The Big Short from last year, Phillips doesn't have the nerve to go all the way.Where McKay exquisitely balanced comedy, drama and satire to dazzling effect, Phillips seems too intent on focusing on the goofball antics of its hapless anti-heroes to deliver any real bite. This is a story that highlights many things from the government's irresponsible approach to warfare, the dangerous practice of allowing just anybody to legally deal in arms, and the devastating effects of blind ambition, but these themes are only touched upon. Packouz is essentially our lead character, but he feels like little more than an exposition tool, with de Armas getting the thankless role of the boring partner who must warn her hubby whenever his actions lead him into the dark side. Thankfully, Jonah Hill is a tour de force, cranking his loathsome character up to 11 without ever feeling unbelievable, proving once again what a versatile actor he is becoming. If you're looking for an intelligent satire of a fascinating recent event, then you probably won't find it here, but as a piece of entertainment, it certainly delivers.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Seems like an odd pairing of Miles Teller and Jonah Hill in a war pic, but real great pic.","Similar tone to Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, It was a lot more serious than what I expected after seeing the trailer. It's not the first time I've seen either Miles Teller or Jonah Hill in something more dramatic, I just may have assumed their first real outing together in a movie would be more of a straight up comedy.Semi based on a true story of two young guys from Miami who became arms dealers, Miles Teller narrates the story of how David Packouz teamed up with this best friend from the tenth grade, Efraim Diveroli and got in too over his head.I was expecting more comedy from the two rather than just two young stars being entertaining. The movie is not disappointing with the team of Teller and Hill. If you are a fan of either one of these guys you are going to love the film.Jonah Hill gives a performance that seem to be something between what he did in 21 Jump Street and the Wolf of Wall Street. The part just fits him so well as he plays a con man who tries to be everyone to everything on the outside but is really evil in the inside, and no matter how much you discover about his evil, Hill still makes the character likable.But the likability is more met for Miles Teller, who Hill is supporting with greatness. Teller plays the sympathetic role of a man whose lost in his life at a time when his girl is about to have a baby, and he needs the money.Director, Todd Phillips weaves a story about how people have profited from the war, and done bad things to profit from a bad war. It's almost like the Big Short, with it's explanation about how the arms game really works, but I always felt that the actual story was getting overshadow by the personalities of the two stars worthy of watching.But overall, It is a very funny film and very entertaining, thanks to the Hill, Teller combohttp://cinemagardens.com",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
great work from Jonah Hill,"It's 2005 Miami. David Packouz (Miles Teller) is struggling as a masseuse. He reconnects with childhood friend Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill). Efraim has been buying guns from police auctions and reselling them online. There is a new government clearing house website for military contracts and he's looking to pick up some of the crumbs. David joins him after getting girlfriend Iz (Ana de Armas) pregnant. With dry cleaner Ralph Slutsky (Kevin Pollak) providing the capital, they start getting some contracts. Eventually, they meet unsavory arms dealer Henry Girard (Bradley Cooper) and get a massive Afghan deal.This is unlike Todd Phillips' more famed comedic movies. It's not big laughs but it is a lighter look at a darker world. Jonah Hill gets chubbier to fit this character perfectly. He is a douche but he is not a threatening douche. He has just enough crazy but not uncontrolled. His chemistry with Teller is terrific. This is a compelling story told in a compelling and engaging way. It's great all around and an overlooked gem.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Formulaic,"War DogsOne could sum up this movie in a single word, ""formulaic.""If you've ever watched any of the movies about West Coast drug-dealing of the 80s (Blow), or any movie with Benicio Del Toro in it (Snatch, Traffic), you will quickly recognize one or more of the stylistic techniques stamped all over this movie:Off-camera narration by one of the protagonists talking about how smart or stupid they were at this point in the adventure.Wackiness in the face of danger.Celebration of the stoner mentality.Overhead shots using helicopters or drones.Overuse of circular camera dolly around two subjects quibbling to suggest ""tension.""Cool music.Oddity------Choice of music. The setting for the movie is the early 2000s, and these guys are in their 20s, yet the music is a collection golden oldies from 60s. Is that the music the producers like? Is it aimed at the suspected target audience?Nitpicks-------The lead character says ""Bro"" more times than any character in any movie in history. Guess that's a refreshing change from ""dude."" LOL.Aside from all that, I still liked the movie, just thought is was hackneyed and formulaic.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Eye opening - very interesting and funny look at arms dealing,"The story is eye opening, relevant and very clearly told with a humorous tone through the serious subject matter. This is based on a true story with some fictionalized elements to make it entertaining. A massage therapist links up with a childhood friend who is a small time arms dealer. Very interesting to get a look at the legal but morally questionable world of arms dealing. I thought this would be a juvenile buddy movie with a bit of war thrown in but it isn't.Jonah Hill has some funny lines and he does a great job with the over the top character but he can be subtly sinister when he needs to be. Miles Teller plays his character sympathetically and I liked him here. Quite different from the rather annoying characters he usually plays. Bradley Cooper who produced the movie and has a small but pivotal role and he is effective as an arms dealer.Quite a transporting experience as the action takes you from Miami to Jordan and Iraq with some funny situations there and Albania.Watch this movie. It deserves to do better than it has so far.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A solid, fun and informative film!","I enjoyed War Dogs. The film has Todd Phillip's visual style throughout that has been displayed in his previous films, which is a professional glossy feel. The acting went from just being OK to good as the film went on. The first act suffered the most, not only story wise but acting wise. As the film got going both aspects started to kick into gear.The film reminded me a little of Lord of War for obvious story reasons but in tone reasons as well. I like learning about these type of situations and stories that seem to slip through the cracks of our observed society and to learn how these issues actually drastically affect our world society. War Dogs accomplishes this for me. The tone comes with a comedic and light heart-ed ""fun"" of the subject but it still brings a darker serious side as well, and when I left the theater it kept me thinking of how the world is and operators.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another disappointing summer movie,"In 'War Dogs' we follow Miles Teller and Jonah Hill as two young men trying to make money from the war in Iraq by selling weapons to the US army. The movie is directed by Todd Phillips who is better known for the 'The Hangover' trilogy.Right of the bat the movie tries to seem more clever than it actually is. Via a flash-forward that shows one of the main characters in a predicament the movie tries to create a sense of tension that would otherwise have been non-apparent. This quickly fades as the story is very predictable with characters that are not all that interesting considering their motives are never properly explained and very flimsy. Throughout the movie is some narration paired with title cards indicating different chapters. Most of the times the chapters do not seem any different which made these title cards unnecessary and it is clear they were just added afterwards in as a last ditch effort to make the movie more interesting. Halfway trough the movie almost comes to a grinding halt and from thereon out it never really manages to get the viewer's interest back.The directing was very bland, considering not one scene was shot in a very interesting fashion. Often times it seemed as if the movie does not really know what it wants to be. Sometimes character's respond to a certain situation in a comedic fashion while other times the tone is shifted to a more serious one. Todd Phillips never really tries to mix in some of his own style and with another director the movie would've probably turned out roughly the same.The only redeeming factor of the movie are the actors themselves as they did a decent job at portraying their characters, though ultimately not one performance was very memorable. In the end 'War Dogs' joins the 2016 collection of disappointing summer movies.My rating: 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
A success story that makes you think and reflect,"This film tells the story of a message therapist who goes broke because his business venture of selling luxury bed sheets does not work out. He is recruited by his childhood friend to make big money by bidding on military contracts.""War Dogs"" touches on a mysterious aspect of the world which is not often talked about. Therefore, the story is already intriguing, and I want to find out what happens to the two guys. What they do might seem questionable to some, and their subsequent success gives much food for thought. The ending makes you think and reflect on the fine line between right and wrong; and how people can get caught up in their successes. Another god aspect is that despite the subject matter, the story manages to be funny yet still remains dramatic enough to be taken seriously. I enjoyed watching it.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Hill and Teller star in a ""Lord of War"" mixed with ""Wolf of Wall Street"" type Movie","Told in Scorsese-esque fashion, ""War Dogs"" follows two arms dealers and they go through the trials and tribulations of selling weapons to the U. S government and eventually the black market. This film looks like a modernized ""Scarface"", with its overaturated color palette and location set mainly in Miami. For starters this film looks quite good, but does have a digital sheen that can easily be noticed. These shots by Lawrence Sheer are hard not to appreciate visually. If you have problems with a film with a modern look, pass on this.Teller and Hill are awesome and have a great chemistry as friends and business partners. I have to credit Hill for taking what could have been a two dimensional phony and making the character grounded and off kilter in the best of ways. Who can forget that laugh Hill created for the character? That was hysterical...This is definitely one of those films where the females get side lined, so just go in knowing that you will only see Ana de Armas briefly. The script has times where it really works despite some characters being thrown to the side. Especially with its use of narration which I thought worked and clearly was paying homage to Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". Todd Phillips knows how to direct comedy, and to be honest, the best bits in this movie are when the black comedy is working on all cylinders. I have to say though, this film leaves you cold intentionally with the central question of whether this whole adventure was even worth it or not by the end. Overall, I'd recommend this film to those who like movies about American greed and the schisms it can create in relationships.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Maybe not the best Dramedy Biopic, but undeniably an entertaining one.","Not the best film of the year and neither bringing anything new to the Biopic/Drama/comedy genre, but amazingly entertaining with characters that you can identify with, and lots of quotable one-liners. I definitely believe Jonah Hill's performance is going to be nominated for the Golden Globes for Best Comedic Performance. Efraim's unique laugh is practically another character; it's like the role was made for him.Besides Jonah Hill's performance, Miles Teller doesn't get behind. Both actors have great chemistry between them, making the movie an enjoyable ride. Another thing that I loved was the soundtrack; for real, excellent song choices. Young viewers will find themselves wanting to be this couple of youngsters running for the millionaire contracts, strict viewers may not find anything plausible, but I'm pretty sure they will at least laugh a few times.FINAL CONSENSUS: Committed performances and entertaining moments help to elevate this mild treatment about concerning real life stories.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Exciting, funny, and illegal","The movie starts off narrated, interesting and very cohesive. They do a great job of introducing characters and foreshadowing what is later to come. The characters are very well developed and their relationship especially at the start is funny and light hearted. The acting is great if you like films like ""superbad"" and ""neighbour's"".The plot itself is based off a true story and is really interesting from start to finish. The action is great with slight comedy here and there. It has very wolf of wall street vibes and is a thrill ride.When Bradley Cooper gets involved there is a lot of mystery and suspense. You really don't know whats gonna happen and your interest becomes even greater. The contract part was extremely predictable. The ending was very weird, without spoiling it, someone goes to jail for what seems a really short amount of time considering the crime. Then someone gets given money which is somewhat satisfying. But you really don't get a feeling of revenge or justice.Summary:
Overall I was really surprised at how good this was. Its not just your average comedy. It has great characters, acting, story, and is a blast to watch. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

There were some interesting ways the story was told as well which certainly spiced something's up and had you caring about the characters in the movie. Obviously the point.

A dull movie with no new ideas,"Miles Teller and Jonah Hill in a movie about international gun runners? Sign me up! Is what I was saying going into the film. Coming out was a different story. As is the story with many movies so far this year, 'War Dogs' is a boring mess of a movie. If you saw 'The infiltrator' or read my review you know I hated that film. And for the same reasons I hate that film, I hate this one. Except this one has the nerve to be nearly identical to the far superior 'Wolf Of Wall Street'. This movie hits all the same beats and story lines that Scorseses near masterpiece does. The difference between the two is that this one is neither funny nor entertaining to watch.It is quite possibly one of the most dull, lifeless, boring films I have seen this year. Every time something funny or stressful could have happened it just cuts to another scene. Or, even more upsetting, ques up a voice over track from Teller. It blatantly skips over possible character building scenes in favor of out of place, lazy voice overs.I don't think I would be lying when I say that there is more voice overs here than in 'Knight of Cups'. Which literally had not script. Why the choice was made to do this really comes down to laziness. There is no other reason to explain why it couldn't just let scenes play out. Not only was there countless voice overs that robbed scenes of tension, but it also did chapter kind of things.Every twenty minutes or so a black screen with a sentence appeared on screen, describing what we were about to see. Just like the voice work, it didn't seem to have a point to it. It just felt like it didn't know how to transfer to the next scene so it threw in these random titles. They came from no where and served literally no purpose other than to tell you what was going to happen before it did.But what was I expecting? Right from the first few scenes this film has jarring tones that clash with each other from scene to scene. The first shot of the movie is a tense scene involving a kidnapping and it cuts immediately to a stylized, scene with a pop song playing over top. It is a completely jarring tonal shift that is off and on through out the film. And, much like 'Suicide Squad' it has no idea how to place a song in a scene.The songs it chooses are good on their own but, the scenes they are used in makes me hate them. All but maybe once were they used appropriately. It's sad that films have decided to just throw in pop songs to try and get a bigger audience instead of making a score that works in the film. It never helps the story move forward, they are all just kind of there.That being said, nothing could have saved this story. As I said, it's exactly like 'Wolf of Wall Street'. But it's not near as fun nor does it have the interesting character study that 'Wall Street' has. It has Jonah Hill and Miles Teller furiously trying to make the dialogue they have sound organic. Yet, it's so poorly written that these Oscar worthy actors come across with little chemistry and sound like morons while doing it.There isn't much that redeems this film. It's mostly well shot and these two performances aren't to bad. Other than that everything fails. It's poorly written, horribly boring, offers no interesting characters, and fails to deliver any comedic moments. It's one of those movies that thinks it's so much better than it is. It wants to be great and desperately tries to be but falls flat on its face.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
a well made war comedy,"Todd Philips has done a fine job in creating a nice War Comedy.

Based on a real life story of David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli, who won a $300 million contract from the Pentagon to arm America's allies in Afghanistan, the director has done a great job in converting a dry story into an entertaining movie.Jonah Hill keeps up the comedy of the film through out.

"Somewhat Funny, but Riddled with Clichés","War Dogs seems like a film with a ton of potential, because of the people involved in it, but lacks the spark to make it anything other than okay. The problem seems to be that the crew wanted to tell a true story and make the audience laugh but didn't fully understand, given the source material, how to do that. War Dogs is intermittently funny, but relies too much on clichés, and fails to pack any kind of a punch. If you're trying to figure out what kind of a movie this is, picture The Big Short with a slightly lesser known crew.War Dogs did have a lot going for it, namely the talents of Miles Teller and Jonah Hill, as well as the direction of Todd Phillips (The Hangover Trilogy.) Above that the trailers for this film looked fairly funny, but note that almost all of the genuinely funny parts of the movie are contained in the trailer. That being said the film often tries to take a more dramatic approach, and fails to ever generate a hilarious moment. That being said both Miles Teller and Jonah Hill's performances are great in this film.While Teller and Hill are great in this film it really feels too familiar, as if you've seen it before. That shouldn't be the case with a film about two men in their twenties running guns in the Iraq War. That being said it ends up making it's characters into clichés, and tells an overdone storyline about rags to riches idiots, and betrayal of best friends. It really is a shame because, as I mentioned before, this film could've been very original and interesting, but ends up being like most other films of today, more recycled than anything else.Above that the film fails, at what it ultimately wants to do, which is pack a punch. It seems self evident watching it, that the director and writers wanted to expose a scary problem in America, and at the same time generate a few laughs. In that sense it's a lot like The Big Short, however War Dogs fails to ever do what it strives to do. Where The Big Short was informational, funny, and in the end terrifyingly honest, War Dogs is not. This movie may have a moment or two, but seems to miss it's intended mark on both ends, in that it's not as funny as it'd like to be nor is it as damning.In the end War Dogs feels like more of an average film, which is disappointing because it had the potential to do everything wanted to. If you expect a great comedy, it's not really that, if you're expecting a great look at true and terrifying events that led to two young immature men running guns for America, it's not really that either. War Dogs is funny, well acted, and has a story to tell, but relies on clichés, stereotypes, and doesn't offer very much thought provoking material. This is a good film if you want a few chuckles but it doesn't supply a ton of laughs.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
selling weapons is not nice kids business,"'War Dogs' is the second movie 'inspired by a true story' that I have seen in the last 24 hours, and is actually the one that I liked better (the other one being 'The Infiltrator'). Its film-making style (director Todd Phillips) and its comic thriller approach fit well the month of August. If I am to chose one easier entertainment with no super-heroes or space-ships, and yet a film that raises serious issues this summer, I will recommend it (but of course, I did not see them all).I am not sure if 'War Dogs' will make it to too many Jewish film festivals, but the two lead characters are Jewish or better say one nice Jewish kid (acted by Miles Teller) and a one Jewish trouble-maker kid (acted by Jonah Hill) who meet about one year after high-school. The bad guy is already in weapons trade and he easily convinces the good guy to become an associate. It's the Bush-Cheney period, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan need arms, and the government seems to have privatized at least part of the guns and ammo supply chain and opened it to free competition. A golden business opportunity for many, including the couple of young entrepreneurs who start small, win bigger and bigger contracts, break more and more moral rules, laws and trade restrictions, move into bigger offices and houses, and ask themselves less and less questions about what is right and what is wrong to do in such business.The film is fun to watch. There is no great characters development, the characters are from the start to the end what they seem to be when they show up for the first time, but they are enjoyable, and Jonah Hill at least does here his best role on screen to date. Bradley Cooper also shows up in a small but key supporting role. Story telling has pace and humor, although I could have given up the off-screen story telling which tries to provide the personal and somehow moralizing perspective of the good guy. It seems to be a returning fashion in the American cinema which I frankly dislike. It usually hides lack of skills in setting the contest and telling the story, but it was not the case here.It's the final titles before the credits, the one that usually relate the characters on screen with the reality of the 'true story' and show the real faces of the 'heroes' that we have seen acted on screen, that made me click. So these guys, who sold lethal weapons that caused death in the battlefields of Iraq or Afghanistan, who tricked the government and the individuals fighting for what they believe is a just cause got a few years in jail (one of them) and a suspended sentence (the other one) and they are now selling their story in books and movies? Something is broken in our justice systems if the 'war dogs' selling illegal weapons to the conflict areas are not punished. This film is not a masterpiece, but at least it causes to some of us to ask the right questions.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Solid film, but lacks originality","This film is definitely worth the watch. Jonah Hill and Myles Teller both shine superbly in this film, and Bradley Cooper has some genuine mystique about him during his performance. However, this is the second film I have seen this year, that seems to try and recapture the brilliance of Martin Scorcese's 'Wolf of wall street'. What I mean by that is both this film and 'The Big Short' take a complex real life event, that not a whole lot of people fully understood, and made a film that took time to make light of the scenarios, and tried to explain them to the audience in a common way.This film does it well, and beats 'The Big Short' as it was definitely the easier film to follow. However, it does use a lot of comedy aspects from 'Wold of Wall Street'. You compare Jonah Hill's character Efraim to Donnie his character from TWOWS, they are exactly the same for the first half of this movie. Also, this movie makes light of a very serious real life scenario, and felt to safe considering the context. It's to light hearted and the only real drama or tension comes from the two friends.On it's own this film is highly re-watchable, and that's down to the lightheartedness, but take a second to stop and think about the real life story, it feels to lighthearted. With Wall Street it worked because all the characters were terrible people, so it was funny to see them mess up. Here, Myles Teller plays a very likable character, and with some of the sinister characters, this film needed to feel more threatening.However, credit is where credits due, the film did a great job of breaking down how arms dealing works, the same way TWOWS did for stock brokering. and the tone just felt fun, and made it easy to watch. To use wrestling terms, the heel turn seemed a little off, and needed more build, and also just the amount of similarities to TWOWS, from the way they close it out, to Jonah Hill's performance, just the narration by Teller, these films are almost parallel, so that holds this film back from being truly great.But, the funny thing is, this film works. Hill's performance as both a comedic and dramatic actor is fantastic, he balances the two so well. If you haven't seen TWOWS, your going to love this move a hell of a lot, while the film lacks the risks to make it an instant classic, and is to lighthearted on the seriousness of this real life industry, its still fun and re-watchable, and the script and how this film flows just makes it enjoyable viewing.I know I have talked long about the lack of originality, but honestly besides that and the lack of tone, or pushing the boundaries, the film does its job well. Hill and Teller have great chemistry, and I could go back and watch this over and over again. The effort to make people aware of this event can not be faulted, and they made arms dealing and the art of war a lot easier to understand that Big Short did for the financial crisis in 08. The sinister tone to end it, was definitely a tonal shift, but I won't spoil it for you here. I'm just going to say, you will have fun, if you're a fan of TWOWS or similar films, or you really enjoy Jonah Hill or Myles Teller, they deliver. I'm giving it a 4/5 stars.If it pushed the boundaries more, and had more originality I would have given it a 4.5 which I only reserve for great movies. As it is though, it's a re-watchable, fun, well acted, educational film. And you won't even know you're being educated.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
War is a funny business,"This is my review of War Dogs (spoiler free).*** (3/5) Cast: Jonah Hill, Miles Teller, Ana de Armas, Bradley Cooper.Plot: Two men who were best friends in high school decide to reunite and become arms dealers, but as their life they get a deal that could possibly be the best deal for them, however this deal could be a big mistake for these two.War Dogs is sold as a comedy. Yet it is the most serious adult war comedy out there. After director Todd Phillips' made an impact in the comedy world with the Hangover trilogy yes even the clunky, unfunny sequels. This is quite a challenge for him as he tries to create grown-up material without a naked Ken Jeong leaping on one of their faces. Yet he succeed with a sort of funny adult war story that has a few laughs sprouting every now and then but it is mostly serious. David Packouz (Teller, still keeping his master performance from Whiplash in play) is a man who wants more from his life rather than being a salesman of expensive Egyptian sheets and his life as a licensed masseuses, until he sees an old friend from high school Efraim Diveroli (Hill) and they get back together again. David and Efraim are now friends again and Efraim introduces him to his job and he is instantly jealous of his life. Although this feels much like the Wolf of Wall Street especially with the narration this mainly comes from David this makes the whole experience a whole lot better.As the story goes on the comedy standards get better and funnier and this also makes for fun dialogue, mainly said by the two lead characters. However the two lead actors are both ten years older than the characters they are playing yet with their riveting performances you seem to forget that. It's also filled with pretty good action although not as good as a Scorsese masterpiece but the pacing feels the same in this and the pacing is spaced out to show that the director certainly didn't rush to make this feature. There is pretty good action not much in terms of violence but mainly from the use of guns, and also the funny one liners each of the lead roles come out with. In one scene when the two friends go to Albania a country literally torn by war they have to deliver a ton of ammo in a very short time but as this goes through David has to stay there alone while, Efraim gets drunk and also he does the most sinister thing ever which will probably end their friendship, however Efraim realizes his mistake and tries to make it better, without success. There are even emotional standards in the film. Although filled with masculinity apart from the one woman Ana de Armas' Iz who is David's girlfriend but that is all the femininity that this film has to offer so mostly men. Especially with Bradley Cooper's top arms dealer Henry Girard's random outburst ""See this is why I like arms dealing - no women."" Although apart from all the funny outbursts this peace of comedy is mostly serious, with a much similar tone to Whiskey Tango Foxtrot another comedy about a war torn country and the lead role goes there to try an sort things out. So essentially based on the Hangover series and yes even the Wolf of Wall Street, this shows to be a film that is based around war time can serious and funny at the same time.Verdict: Buoyed by riveting performances and pretty action, this proves that Todd Phillips can do grown-up material without a naked Ken Jeong.6/10 Rude and laugh out loud funny.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Entertaining performances and visuals alongside a slight lack of serviceable writing,"Usual hit-or-miss director Todd Phillips returns after the last couple of force fed Hangover duds, but delivers a steadily paced and solidly entertaining biopic which has been marketed as a ""Wolf Of Wall Street"" for the ""Hangover"" fans.The film's plot revolves around two young in-over-their-heads gun runners, told from the perspective of the relative straight man of the duo David Packouz, portrayed by Miles Teller. Jonah Hill plays Efraim Diveroli, the bombastic and over confident member of the two. The film relies on the set up to be the plot as the story more or less takes us through the whole meaty parts of the true story in a positively meandering fashion, as the leads run into major success as well as major mishaps.Both Hill and Teller successfully carry this film, though Hill is given center stage as well as more scenes and moments as opportunities to shine. Teller works well in his role once again deferring from the loud/party animal figure his introductory roles offered. After seeing ""The Spectacular Now"" and ""Whiplash"", it was hard not to think of how great his role here could have been if given more room to work. Hill impresses in his role, offering layers of seediness and greed under the likable and humorous character he portrays. Nonetheless the acting all round is solidly delivered.Phillips does a sufficient job with his directing duties, as the passion can be noticed behind the film. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher offers impressive visuals of each of the settings that are shown throughout.I would recommend this film for it's entertaining performances, steady pacing and visuals. Though the writing may be on and off in its quality throughout. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
WOW. Amazing movie!,"""War Dogs"" takes us on a rollercoaster journey through the seedy world of international arms dealing, and it's a ride you won't soon forget. Directed by Todd Phillips and based on a true story, this film left me thoroughly entertained and forever changed my perspective on the business of war.From the very beginning, it's clear that ""War Dogs"" is not your average war movie. It doesn't focus on soldiers battling on the front lines; instead, it delves into the morally ambiguous world of two twenty-something stoners turned arms dealers. Jonah Hill and Miles Teller deliver stellar performances as the unlikely duo of Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz, whose ambition and audacity drive the narrative.The film's pacing is impeccable, keeping the audience engaged from start to finish. It's a wild and thrilling ride filled with humor, suspense, and jaw-dropping moments. The dynamic between Hill and Teller is the heart of the film, and their chemistry is electrifying. They manage to bring a sense of charm and likability to characters who are involved in such a morally reprehensible trade.""War Dogs"" is more than just a story of illegal arms dealing; it's a commentary on the global arms industry and the underbelly of war that often goes unnoticed. The film doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of the business, forcing the audience to confront the uncomfortable truth about the world's dependence on weaponry. This eye-opening aspect of the film left me pondering long after the credits rolled.The film's direction and cinematography are top-notch, with Phillips' signature dark humor shining through. The visuals, combined with a well-curated soundtrack, add an extra layer of depth to the storytelling. It's a masterclass in balancing serious subject matter with entertainment value.In conclusion, ""War Dogs"" is a gripping, thought-provoking, and thoroughly entertaining cinematic experience. It will make you laugh, gasp, and perhaps even reconsider your views on war and the arms trade. With standout performances, sharp direction, and a script that keeps you on the edge of your seat, this film is a must-see. Don't miss the chance to take a wild and eye-opening ride with ""War Dogs.""

Solid Movie with a compelling storyline,"Other than reading a brief synopsis of the film, I really wasn't too familiar with the plot of ""War Dogs"". It has an appealing cast and the trailers looked great. I wasn't disappointed. It's not a great movie but Miles Teller is definitely likable and Jonah Hill is stable as his best friend/business partner. The film is well cast and moves at a typical Todd Phillips pace. Decent soundtrack and the various locations in the movie are all an added bonus. The ending is somewhat low-spirited but if it is true to life, then I guess it is on point. Definitely worth a watch, especially if you are not familiar with the narrative.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Everybody Knows,"I thought 'War Dogs' was a hoot from director Todd Phillips with the Jonah Hill, Miles Teller & Bradley Cooper combo when it originally opened in theaters and I've watched it countless times since. There's only one major caveat. Much of the 'true story' elements are fabricated. Not based on reality. It's par for the course, but it's something to know. If you can put that fact aside - there's an equal amount of laughs and intelligibly engaging things to say about the business of war.David Packouz (Teller) has seen better times in Miami with his girlfriend Iz (Ana De Armas) circa 2005. When he reconnects with his childhood friend Efraim Diveroli (Hill) who's in the business of fulfilling government contracts for munitions his whole life changes. Finding out he's about to be a father puts additional pressure on him. He partners up in his friend's company AEY & everything takes a turn. Financially, morally and legally as the two young men go down a crazy rabbit hole traversing the world closing deals and making bank. Along the way hooking up with renown arms dealer Henry Girard (Cooper) who's operating in a grey area as their magical hookup to the biggest deal they've ever done.Fans of Jonah will enjoy an equal mix of big man attitude, arrogance & charm. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention his spray on tan and odd laugh. Miles plays our fish out of water guide with likability & simplicity. The attractive Armas is the movie's moral compass. You also get actors Kevin Pollak, Patrick St. Esprit & Shaun Toub contributing drama or humor. I only wish we got more of Cooper. His gun running mega-man is an intriguing character.'War Dogs' tries to be a fun time while lightly exploring it's themes & real life crimes and it succeeds. Once again much of it is fiction, but that doesn't stop it from delivering killer moments. Title cards are used well to make punchlines or drive the point home. The film also features a good selection of licensed music inserted beautifully at the right places to draw emotions or create the necessary vibes.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Hilarious Throwback to Carefree Friendship.,"War Dogs is a film that perfectly blends humor with a wild, real-life story, and after watching it, the nostalgia hits hard. It takes you back to a time when life was simpler, with no responsibilities weighing you down, and you could just mess around with your mates without a care in the world. Even though I'm 18 now, I'll never forget those carefree days between 16 and 18 - the chaos, the jokes, the pointless arguments, the late-night talks about anything and everything. Those years were all about friendship, pushing boundaries together, and experiencing things for the first time, which is exactly what War Dogs captures in a slightly exaggerated, yet hilarious way. The chemistry between Jonah Hill and Miles Teller reminds me of that bond, the kind where you have each other's back no matter how crazy things get. It makes you think, no matter where life takes you, you'll always have those moments and friendships that define who you are.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Get rich quick, bit of wish fulfilment with a good message in the end","This is a great and underrated movie. It is paced perfectly, with great humour mixed with moments of seriousness. Jonah Hill is fantastically hilarious as Efraim the ambitious, loose and cut throat arms dealer and Miles Teller is also flawless as the protagonist of the film, his old best friend David who gets drawn in to fast war money.These kind of films appeal to me, the ones that present a world of underdogs making a success of themselves either bending or breaking the rules, but also showing the morality of how ultimately if you live that way one day you will slip, and one day it will all come crashing down.The movie has a couple of absolute great moments, without spoiling too much the weed dealers and chase scene. The interplay between the two best friends is also played well. All other characters play support bits in and out at best, Ana de Armas can act, but I couldn't tell if she was acting well in this movie because of the thick accent but honestly she was not hired for her acting ability in this film. Jonah Hill definitely steals the show - he can play one character very well and he does it too perfection here.An enjoyable ride, not to everyone's taste but I like it a lot.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Fun Movie In An Oversaturated Genre,It's got some good sequences. Some nice footage of Jordan (I've been there; it's a cool place) and old industrial Armenia and I like how there is a constant chemistry between the leading actors so you actually feel the bromance.However there are so many films like this. It's hard to ascertain what is legit without researching and knowing what is fabricated. However on the trivia it does state that there was much more 'office action' than country visits. There is always things done for cinematic effect.Efraim Diveroli (played by Josh Hill) is like the ultimate drop-out Uni party buddy unable to control his urges and obsessions. It's almost like his Superbad character grew up and you get him much later in life.Miles Teller is the standout. He looks like a college nerd about to sell you the new Facebook. His dialogue is strong and his ability to act emotionally is high. He is the balance and the cool head in this movie.It is a very fun movie and perfect popcorn movie time. It is just quite over done for what it is. Dialogue could be better in the opening bromance sequences and there is some yeah right moments included. It pulls it back later on and I enjoy the finish and how it ended.There are genuine funny moments like the guys selling weed and the Malboro desparately fuelling the van whilst driving. Screenplay is very good and it is a deserving 7/10.,7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Rated #8.

An energetic and fun gun-running trip,"With one of those true life stories that you'd never believe had it not actually happened at its disposal, Old School and The Hangover director Todd Phillips and his capable duo of Miles Teller (in need of a hit) and the scenery chewing Jonah Hill (going all method on us) make War Dogs an entertaining and quick-fire experience that shines a light on an interesting aspect of White House law and how strange our modern warfare has become.A dark comedy filled to the brim with deplorable and colourful characters, language and drug addled life lessons, War Dogs is one of those somewhat uneasy hybrids that flirts the line between becoming and out and out drama or an outright comedy and while Phillips at times finds his directional abilities tested in a tale that has a number of different aspects going on at any one time the story of best friends turned gun running business partners David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli is brought to life by Teller and Hill thanks to their considerable talents and the two actors know doubt elevate the material at their disposal to another level.The talents of these two performers has been evident in such tales as Whiplash, The Spectacular Now, The Wolf of Wall Street and Moneyball and while War Dogs won't be going down on their all-time greatest list and Hill has a tendency to take things a little too far (his Efraim is a nigh on irremediably arrogant creature and his laugh is a little much) the two work up a good cooperation on screen and when they're both doing their thing from a near suicidal gun run through the Iraq wastelands or conducting a government meeting while far from clear headed, War Dogs is a film owned by the actors.Who would've thought that two mid 20 year old's with a tendency for drugs, alcohol and massages could've become arms dealers for the United States Government but War Dogs makes good use of its bizarre yet true story and while the film isn't as smart as it perhaps thinks it is, this is a fun and breezy experience that would make for a great double bill with the underrated Nichols Cage starrer Lord of War.3 ½ golden grenades out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Dark Comedic Take on Iraq Gun Runners - What Could Have Been?,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was intrigued. The screenplay was extremely promising. A true story of two 20 something stoners turned gun runners during the Iraq War, and it was directed by Todd Phillips? Will this go the way of Spotlight, or even The Wolf of Wall Street?It does not reach the acclaim of either of those two films, but I will say that it makes for an entertaining watch. War Dogs borders on the seriousness of Spotlight, but also includes the debauchery of Wolf. And that's not a bad thing, but it cheaply cashes out instead of digging deeper.Phillips took many creative liberties with the story. Take a look at the original Rolling Stone piece, or any other article and you'll see exactly what I am talking about.Jonah Hill and Miles Teller portray the two real life runners, Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz, despite looking nothing like them. They are here for the laughs. Both offer plenty, but Teller's character provides a seriousness to counter Hill's Scarface persona. They create a dynamic buddy pairing that neither is bad, nor great.Phillips picked a screenplay that is so interesting, it would be very difficult to screw up. He avoids doing so by instead taking the safe route. For more substance, check out the movie's inspiration, the book ""Arms and the Dudes.""",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Wait for HBO for this one,"This is a tepid, funny at times, thriller about two criminals that attempt to defraud the US during war time. We get incredibly overweight Johah Hill back on the big screen playing a character of almost multiple personalities that has zero moral integrity. Miles Teller, who is trying to remain relevant in Hollywood, plays what seems to be a lesser evil person (and the somewhat moral compass of this story) but his character also agrees to defraud the US government. Hollywood seems taken with making movies about massive scum buckets (see Wolf of Wall Street, The Big Short, etc.) These two guys are certainly near the top of that list. Regardless of these characters lack of morals, the story is moderately interesting and has a few exciting scenes. If you stumble across it on HBO in the future and there is nothing else to see, it is worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Boring to the point of putting you to sleep,"I think the title sums it up. Jonah Hill's laugh is annoying as anything and so is this movie. Hell, I'd say it's worse than Jared Leto's ""attempt"" at the Joker laugh. Just like the laugh, the movie is a half-ass attempt at being as cool as Fight Club or Ocean's Eleven but all of it amounting to nothing other than being boring to the point of putting you to sleep.STORY & SCRIPT - The story is about two high-school friends who meet over a funeral after a long time. Miles Teller's character,David works as a masseuse and has an incredibly hot, Spanish girlfriend. You want logic here? Look away. As David can't make both ends meet Efron(Jonah Hill) offers a job in his company, so that he can support his family and also help Efron make the most out of the loop-holes in the American system. As this is based on a true story, I really can't say that which is more absurd, the plot or the story- telling. The script is woven over this plot, which sounds like a joke you tell at a party and everybody has a good laugh. But here, that joke is extended to a 2- hour long film full of phone-calls and talking and narration. There is so much narration that you will start thinking that why are they showing the film, just read the script and get it over with.DIRECTION - Now it is clear that Todd Phillips was indeed a one-time wonder with the Hangover. Maybe it was a stroke of luck or stroke of genius but it isn't working now. The levels of absurdity which was promised in the trailers are missing. Like I said, if you have to make a party-time joke into a movie, you better have the substance for it. The movie begins with a semi-dark-comedic tone and then it goes all dark and gloomy. This is in the first 40 minutes. The rest of the movie keeps going up and down regarding tone. It's all over the place. The characters aren't given time to build up. Few small, stereotypical, easily relatable situations and a truckload of narration. That's what the director used to establish the characters. On top of that, the movie suffers from the Suicide Squad syndrome. Songs everywhere. Just everywhere. There is a scene in the movie where three things are happening simultaneously:narration, characters talking and music playing. It was just horrible.ACTING - Other than Bradley Cooper's small role as a shady agent, everyone was what they are. Miles Teller was Miles Teller. There was no actual room for character building because of the exposition and narration by his character. Jonah Hill is awful. Either he is shouting too loud or he is laughing. I hate that laugh. If it was intentional, good job, Jonah because it really took me out of the movie.FINAL VERDICT - Give it a pass. It does boast of two of the youngest and finest actors right now in Hollywood but watch it if you want to know how stupid the American Defence system is. I mean, that's the only takeaway from this. You won't remember the characters, nor the story. Yes, you'll remember that laugh.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It is definitely style over substance, but it is enjoyable and worth a watch despite having little staying power.","'War Dogs (2016)' is, a comedy/drama starring Jonah Hill and Miles Teller as a pair of amateur arms-dealers, directed by Todd Phillips of 'The Hangover (2009)' fame. The film is loosely based on a true story, even featuring a cameo by the actual person portrayed by Teller, though it takes several liberties with its source material. The feature isn't as controversial or important as it perhaps thinks it is, but it is still mostly entertaining with good performances despite having little beneath the surface.The movie spends more time trying to create a style then it does trying to inject the story with substance, and as a whole suffers for it. The narration is very expositional and feels lazy, not to mention that the film freeze-frames for no reason other than for Teller to get his voice-over out, and the semi-frequent use of stock-footage gets a little annoying as it feels rather out of place. The other thing that gets on my nerves is the intermittent quotation title cards, used as unnecessary chapter breaks. These short asides are never needed, their unnecessary nature compounded by the fact that they always contain a quote that's then said in dialogue just minutes later. They also don't separate distinct parts of the plot, such as time-jumps or location changes, and thus beg the question as to why they were included. The stylistic choices hark back to 'The Wolf Of Wall Street (2013)' and 'The Big Short (2015)', but they never add up to something unique and instead feel like retreads. Because these elements never feel consistent, the film itself comes across as poorly disciplined. The story is interesting most of the time, and the two lead characters provide engaging screen presences, though the film does drag its heels in its second act. As a whole it feels a bit too long, lacking a proper finale and leaving us with a relatively weak conclusion. There isn't really any danger and the characters tend to enjoy what they're doing. In the end, it all seems mainly inconsequential as it is mostly consequence-free and focused on frivolous antics. It doesn't get as deep into the ethics of the situation as it should, leading to a light and fluffy affair with little staying power. The other issues with the story are that it is generally unmemorable, spends too much time on set-up but not enough on pay-off and features weak characterisation.Aside from than the two leads, the other players don't have anything to do - even Ana de Armas' character is only included to provide a motive for Teller's protagonist to do what he does. It's a shame as there are some great actors here; the best performance is given by Bradley Cooper but he is barely on screen. Thankfully, the two leads are good. Hill delivers another diverse dramatic performance that proves he can really act, while Teller is solid as essentially a surrogate for the audience. The script is decent, featuring fairly naturalistic dialogue and some witty banter. However, I don't find the film funny at all. When I watched it, the audience I saw it with laughed consistently while I barely cracked a smile. It doesn't take away from the flick's overall success, but I feel as though the thing definitely works better as a drama than a comedy. That's why it is a shame that it goes for style and humour over depth and emotion. I think it would have been a much more engaging film if it was a little darker and more contemplative.Technically speaking, everything is good here. The direction is competent, bordering on proficient, but it is unremarkable on the whole and goes largely unnoticed. The cinematography is clean, crisp and efficient. The movie feels tangible from start to finish, with real locations being used frequently and the occasional action being shot neatly. The music is slightly underwhelming, lacking a memorable original score and flittering between licenced pieces frequently. The song choices are quite generic and have been used before under similar circumstances, but they tend to fit the scene they're in and never detract from the experience.Overall, 'War Dogs (2016)' is an enjoyable film that is a clear example of style over substance. The performances are good, the script is entertaining and the plot is mostly engaging, but a lack of depth hurts the staying power of the picture. It is unmemorable and unimportant, but it's a decent time and worth a watch at least once: 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The newest soon to be forgotten entry in the 'loophole' movie genre.,"If you surf the web regularly, then you sooner or later encounter annoying ads promising to reveal to you some sort of secret or 'loophole' that will make you rich. While they are overwhelmingly ignored, the persistence of these ads proves that they gather at least some clicks, if only from people who are bored.Recently, Hollywood appears to have evolved the 'loophole' idea into a little movie genre of its own (seen in 'limitless', 'the big short', 'wolf of wallstreet'). The protagonist, an ordinary Joe with whom we are supposed to identify, comes across a loophole which allows them to generate very large amounts of money using immoral and/or illegal means. To avoid real controversy, the discussion of what is wrong with the system that allows this to happen regularly is usually very limited and there is a catharsis in the end: the protagonist is caught, but gets to go back to an 'ordinary' life. The fast food version of social criticism if you will.If the kind of movie I just described is familiar to you, then there is nothing in 'War Dogs' that you will find unexpected. The acting is fair but not memorable - and so is everything else about this movie. The plot does not offer any real twists, down to the fact that (here slight SPOILER) the 'catharsis' part is triggered when the guy who is introduced in the first part of the movie as somebody who cheats people does just that with our protagonist.I can't say that I hated 'War Dogs', but this is only because I did not really care much about it.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very enjoyable story and Jonah Hills laugh makes worth watching even better!,"Such a smooth highly entertaining story about gun runners/business. I originally saw in the theater that was a blast plus wasn't reviewing then. The voice over by Miles Teller is so great, the amount f bombs Jonah Hill uses are glorious, soundtrack is incredible, writing is superb, cinematography is beautiful and the bit of comedy is delightful! War Dogs should've at least won an award that year, definitely deserves it!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Entertaining but Superficial !!,"An hour into War Dogs last nite, I was wondering what is tone of the movie director Todd Philips and the writers (incl him) trying to maintain.At one moment I thought, the movie is trying to be another 'The Wolf of Wall Street' while another moment, I could see 'The Social Network'. And throughout the film, you could see references to many other Hollywood films.But where the director misses the cut is that The Wolf of Wall Street and Social Network had an emotional core which War Dogs doesn't have. At any moment, one doesn't feel sad or bad for the main leads nor feel their anxiety or happiness.However, the film is one joy ride from start to end if you're ready to overlook the lack of core as I did.Its a fabulous true life story of two 20 year old Jews who become arms suppliers for the US Govt. And in one fabulous sequence, they drive from Jordan to Iraq with truck laden with guns to deliver to the US Army.Another highlight of the film is that the director never takes sides. He doesn't tell us the war is bad or how poorly the US Govt awards defence contracts.The performance by the leads is the icing on the cake. Jonah Hill is hilarious as the shallow and devilish Efraim though I could feel the hangover of his role in The Wolf of Wall Street. And Miles Teller beautifully plays the role of a man who trying hard to balance the arms supplier and loving caring husband/father.Bradley Cooper is effective in a small cameo. However, I felt someone like a Pierce Brosnan would have added more layer to the character than Cooper.My last word. Keep your expectations low and you will enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Fails to pull you in,"I found this movie severely disappointing. If fails to deliver much in the way of real drama (Nick Cage's Lord of War did a better job of dramatically pulling one into the seedy world of the arms dealing) and ultimately provides no insight into the primary character's ultimate motivations and personality.The inflated IMDb rating for this movie has to be taken with the grain of salt that basically every IMDb movie gets a six and then gets mysteriously moved up or down by some formula they refuse to reveal.Some reviewers on here have been willing to forgive the lack of dramatic appeal of this movie on the basis of its ""truthiness"", viewing it as a kind quasi-morality play. But for that angle to work, we need some sympathy/insight/reason to care about the central character played by Jonah Hill. This movie provides none. Jonah Hill and Miles Teller play their parts well enough, I suppose. However, if you are going to sacrifice drama for the ""true story""/morality play line, you really need to give the audience some explanation of what it is that leads these character inevitably to their fate.But this movie never even tries. You are left with nothing but questions about Efraim Diveroli and his motivations. He is left basically a cypher.Which leads to the question-then what is the point of this dramatization of a ""true life"" story if lacks any drama and utlimately leaves us clueless about the central character. I'm afraid I can't answer that, and the makers never even seem to try.",,Anonymous,Biography
Like a less intelligent 'Lord Of War',"Much like 'American Made' and 'Atomic Blonde,' this also mismatches the cast and turns what should be a drama into an action film with the wrong feel to it.

"A story, and little else.","I'd been watching quite a few dark programmes on Primr and was desperately looking for some comedy, when I came across War Dogs. When it was over, I went looking for some comedy.It's the story of two people who sell arms. And it's the story of how they did it. I have no idea how true to life it is, but I do know that it's neither overly exciting as a story, nor funny besides some light-hearted moments of banter. I own the similar-.in basic concept- Lord of War and consider it to be a very good movie that I've already watched twice and definitely will again when I feel like it. War Dogs won't be getting a second viewing.There's nothing to hold my interest. I don't find the characters engaging. The relationship between them is not interesting and the story is weak. There is little tension, humour or any sense that this could be real- even though it was. By which I mean it all seems a bit lifeless.As a story, it works.

Better Than Expected,"This is based upon true eventsTwo friends David Packouz (Miles Teller) and Efraim Diverolia (Jonah Hill) venture into the International Arms race and deliver on a contract to provide guns to Baghdad, Iraq. Later, they search Pentagon Offers and - with some creative accounting - win a $300- million Arms Contract to supply the Afghanistan Army with AK-47 ammunition.I didn't think I would like this because I was afraid Jonah Hill would try to be a comedian again and he's never close to that consideration. This is considered a Comedy/Drama (Whaaaa?) However, I saw this as light drama only and found that Jonah Hill does a very good job. If there were funny lines in here I missed all of them.

"War Dogs: an entertaining, exciting, and rarely funny true story","Miles Teller and Jonah Hill star in the remarkable true story of two young arms dealers who became way over their head when they try to snag a $300 million dollar deal. Todd Phillips who brought us the Hangover trilogy gives us a reveal of how much money is invested into the US military, and it can be easily intercepted by two twenty something year old's.Watching Jonah Hill and Miles Teller felt like these two had been working together for years and therefore another successful duo seen on screen this year. We witness the events through Miles Teller's eyes as David Packouz a former massage therapist who jumps from his hollow career to the dangerous arms trade. Though Teller's performance is standard he effectively acts to be the average Joe in the scenario and guides us through the story as the narrator and helps us relate to the character in the situation. We may not totally approve of what this pair are doing we are in favour that Miles Teller ends up okay.But at the heart of it is Hill's performance as the Scarface impersonating money thirsty gangster Efraim Diveroli. Hill gives us a great performance unseen by any other young actor trying to be a rich arms trader, but unfortunately carries a very annoying laugh throughout the film.Also making an appearance is the always charming Bradley Cooper who passes the torch to the aspiring dealers in providing his assistance in the trade. Although his appearance is brief he still gives us a dangerous Robert De-Niro style meeting.War Dogs although based on true events is a surprisingly entertaining and an easy to watch experience. However the film does juggle with its serous dark themes and comedic moments which doesn't quite reach what it wants, as what you get are rather hit and a miss jokes that don't work at the right times, but what you do get are effective jokes that takes a breather from all the seriousness which is much better. This also only really takes place during the middle of the film and from the beginning and end we have the more dark atmosphere of what's going on.All in all War Dogs is entertaining and fascinating in revealing its true story and I'm sure won't let anyone down, but it does not quite make a good balance in humour and drama. 7.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Twizard Rating: 89,"Most people are going to want to see this film based on the trailer alone. It looks like a funny and adventurous heist movie of some sort. While it's not a comedy in the truest sense, it's just light enough to keep the audience involved.The film follows two twenty-somethings, Miles Teller and Jonah Hill, as they venture to the top of the international arms dealer industry. Amidst the war in Iraq, they use unorthodox techniques to fulfill US military contracts.War Dogs gets a little wordy when it's setting things up. Also, Teller's voice-over goes on a little bit too long at times. But while verbose when explaining things, it covers a lot of ground answering most of our questions in a Big Short type of way. Thus, a potentially byzantine premise never becomes convoluted.Teller plays David Packouz, the antiwar protagonist who is contributing to the war effort out of financial necessity. He's good, but Hill arguably carries the film, playing the real-life Efraim Diveroli. He's basically a selfish scumbag who could double as a mob boss at any given moment. Hill broadens his range as an actor with this role, proving he can play sinister along with his goofy trademark. He's so deceptively creepy that we become literally afraid of him.Genre-wise, it might seem to be stuck in limbo, but it's not. The comedy is evenly written and is balanced consistently into the drama. The exposition is fast-paced and doesn't require us to look back scratching our heads.War Dogs doesn't necessarily explore any new territory as far as the life of a criminal goes, but it's educational and entertaining every step of the way.Twizard Rating: 89",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Reminded me of Lord of War!,"This definitely brings to mind Nicolas Cage's 'Lord of War'. While their stories are different, the whole 'arms dealing gone wrong' trope felt similar in some ways.And honestly, that's not a bad thing at all! I really enjoyed Cage's movie; it's one of my favorites. Not just for his acting, but also for the deeper message about how cynical and hypocritical countries indulging in war can be.They will spin tales about defending 'civilian rights' and fighting for 'democracy' or better fighting against 'tyranny' and 'dictatorship,' but at the end of the day, it's all about the money, it all means nothing but business.""War Dogs"" delivers a similar message, but in its own unique style.Writing flows well, and the chemistry between Miles and Jonah as the lead pair captures the vibe well. Plus, the script does not waste time on trivial sub-plots or anything; it prioritises the main story, which I heartily appreciate.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A good movie and a missed opportunity,"This movie is difficult to decipher.It is based on a true story and that story is absurd (in a good way). Therefore the ground material is very valuable, the story flows almost always very precisely from point A to point B, without messing around too much. Maybe a couple of small subplots were unnecessary and made the movie a little bit longer than it should be.The actors' performances are very convincing, Jonah Hill is confirming to be a great actor, pulling off a great performance yet again.What I didn't like about the movie is that it lacks in personality. It seems to me that they wanted to keep a bright tone while narrating very dark events. They are telling a very upsetting story about how the army is getting its weapons, but it looked to me that the movie doesn't take a stand on that matter. I can't really define it better than just saying: the narration is too flat. It looks like it is denouncing something, but it doesn't really do that.In other words, it is a movie of half measures.Probably they could have achieved a much better result by explaining better the transitions in the behavior of the characters, that are, instead, something that simply happens on the screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amused by Jonah Hill & The Scarface Tributes,"War Dogs is a semi-comedy film that tackles arms dealing & how two ragtags takes advantage of the silliness in the US government's procurement system. With its premise, the film happily delivers entertainment through the absurdity of its characters & awry situations when heavy hitters come into play.Todd Philipps and Jonah Hill deserves tons of credit for the film's positive appeal. Despite the seriousness of the subject, Philipps asserts his brand of delightful viewing through cleverly presented expositions & zany humor. The film's transition to deadly & threatening was pleasing and flawless, testament to terrific writing. Known for the Hangover Trilogy, Philipps also asserts his preference of comical and over the top characters, fascinatingly conveyed by one Jonah Hill.Jonah's Efraim Diveroli carries the comedy & conflict of the film. His loathsome, larger than life characterization was compelling, right down to his self inspired demonic chuckle. He is as well a character study of sorts, projecting distrust due to his untrustworthy qualities.Overall, War Dogs shares a striking commentary about the sorry state of wartime America, through a fitfully comic, American hustle storyline. It entertains though the wackiness of its characters & thrills when it turns its head to serious matters. It features as well, an outstanding Jonah Hill portrayal in case you need convincing. Rating: 7.5/10. A high rating could've been given, if not the for the universally staple, overused domestic woes subplot of Miles Teller's David & Ana De Arma's Iz.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Easily my favorite film so far this year.,"Usually at least 8 films on my 10 best list are released from October 1st on, but this one will sure make the list this year.If you are like me and thought that The Big Short should have won Best Picture last year and that in 2014 The Wolf of Wall Street should have won, and that "" Lord of War"" is one of the most underrated films of all time, you will love War DogsMaybe not as good as those two Oscar films but awfully darned close. and better than The Lord of War.Funny , Suspenseful, extremely insightful, and though set during 2005- 2008 it has a soundtrack from the 60-80s that is pitch perfect.Loved Miles Teller and Jonah Hill. Teller is the best actor of his generation. Though this is probably not going to be his best performance this year. I have a feeling his performance in that Boxing film is Oscar bait. Jonah Hill plays the sort of character that he is best known for, but who cares he does it so well. I was not familiar with the female lead Ana De Armas, but she is mesmerizing.Bradley Cooper was terrific in a relatively small role as well.I can see hundreds of twenty somethings wanting to become War Dogs after seeing this film, but I a pretty certain that window of opportunity is closed.This has been a pretty disappointing year so far in film. My guilty pleasure was Tarzan, and I really liked Sing Street and 10 Cloverfield Lane but this is my first ten of the year.

A good enough movie to see even if it is just to appreciate the performance of Jonah Hill,"War Dogs had me captivated at the way the events unfold, as we see two arms dealers try to score big. The movie tells a good story and keeps you curious on how events will turnout. The down side of this movie is we have seen such on screen pair before and while watching you have this striking feeling that the more outspoken carefree character will mess up everything for the partners, so there is no element of surprise when it finally happened.Everyone is always aiming for that one big score, but sometimes the price to pay for that score can eventually make the score a useless endeavour. That was what this movie had to deliver as we watch two childhood friends form a company AEY, which deals specifically in arms deals with the U.S. Pentagon.The movie has one of the best performances I have seen Jonah Hill pull off, he was a master of character shifts in this movie playing a greedy and intelligent Efraim Diveroli. Jonah Hill deserves all the praise he is getting for his performance and even more, as his presence takes the movie which could have been done better into what is enjoyable.War Dogs is a biographical crime drama directed by Todd Phillips. The movie plot is based on a story published in Guy Lawson's 2015 book Arms and the Dudes. Although the movie is biographical many of the elements and happenings were fictions, just wound together to make a more compelling story.What these two 20 something friends did rocked the U.S. Army and caused it to review its procurement dealers and measures.The movie is narrated by David (Miles Teller) who is a licenced massage therapist. David is tired of giving massages to old people for a living, and tried his hand on selling bedsheets to old people's home, but the business failed and David was to lose all his savings. When his old time childhood friend and bad influence Efraim shows up at a burial of a mutual acquaintance, the two hooked up and tried igniting their past fun days. After hearing about David's predicament and his unborn child on her way Efraim asked David to come join him as an arms dealer. Their work together made them enough money to buy houses and live a good life, but they always wanted more and decided to go for a big score worth $ 300 million.The problem is, they had to fool the U.S. Army to get away with it.A good enough movie to see even if it is just to appreciate the performance of Jonah Hill.www.lagsreviews.com",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

War Dogs has some shiny weapons and story: it needed more ammunition to fire off,"Funding the military is expensive. We have bases all over the world, each with facilities and housing for those solders. Each solider (over a million of them) is carrying thousands of dollars worth of equipment and weaponry. I bring this up because war may be a travesty, but it's a business opportunity itself. Several companies are out and about to generate the best material for the armed forces to use, and to do so in an inexpensive way. While I doubt I could ever get into that business (personal morals would prevent me), I can see why gunrunning would seem attractive to those that want the high life.The subjects within War Dogs are gunrunners, but they're also very young. Their college aged, which would make their maturity a big question. The good news is that if your smart enough, then age doesn't matter. What matter's is how well your know your clientele and the best manner to negotiate with.The early 2000's was a period of two wars; the War on Terror in the Middle East and the Invasion of Iraq. Both would obviously require some ammunition. Let's see how the real life subjects handled these ends in War Dogs.Starting off in 2005 in Miami, David Packouz (played by Miles Teller) is a guy with little direction. He dropped out of college, has failed in a business selling sheets to retirement homes, and makes a small living as a massage therapist. While attending a funeral for a friend, he spots his middle school buddy Efraim Diveroli (played by Jonah Hill). The two meet up where we find out that the two did bad things in their youth and Efraim's parents sent him away to work with his uncle's arms business. Efraim has now returned and tells David about his new business venturethe war.Despite not agreeing with the war, David comes on board when his girlfriend Iz becomes pregnant. Efraim shows him how they acquire these contracts: the Pentagon has a website a lot like a job search site where they have thousands of listings for businesses to put a bid into. They manage to acquire contracts from Bagdad to Albania where they stay true to their word and become millionaires overnight. As Efriam's company gets bigger, his greed grows (along with a drug addiction) and tensions rise when David is forced to live in Albania to secure a 30 million deal with a terrorist watch list candidate Henry Girard (played by Bradley Cooper).The idea of irresponsible people getting into a shady business and rising in that world is nothing new. Scarface did this (and is referenced several times. The Wolf of Wall Street, The Lord of War and Pain & Gain did this. What does War Dogs have to offer that's new? The movie brings these two guys who are played well by Jonah Hill and Miles Teller. The movie shows that these guys would be smart enough to pull off these government deals by day while going to Miami nightclubs at night.War Dogs is a nice looking movie. Director Todd Phillips (The Hangover trilogy) has a way of shooting his comedies like thrillers. A lot of that has to do with how he uses lighting. His colorful shooting of Miami becomes brighter once we arrive in the bleaker and grayer Albania.For his first mature story, Todd Phillips found a good blend of political problems, comedy, and some surprising thrills. What's lacking is a closer study at the relationship between these two. With what could have been a dramatic look into these two young men is more of a party. At least what they say can be interesting at times.I'll give this six machine guns out of ten. I can't say that War Dogs is an intelligent insight into how the government acquires its weaponry, but its still an entertaining look at some smart individuals. This needed a Martin Scorsese like director to really help this take off. I can still have fun with this.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Where there is war there is money to be made,"This film, loosely inspired by real events is centred on David Packouz, a young man who works as a masseur in Miami. He doesn't enjoy the work and hopes to make more money selling bed linen to retirement homes but that doesn't work out. Then one day he meets Efraim Diveroli, a friend from his school days. He works as a fairly low level arms dealer but has plans to expend... and with the US engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan there are government contracts to be won. Nothing huge but still something that could ultimately net then hundreds of millions of dollars. The problem is they don't really know what they are doing and getting out of their mistakes will involve cutting corners, breaking the law and putting themselves in danger.I thought this film was a lot of fun. Our two protagonists are entertaining; David is likeable and his narration explains much of what is going on and Efraim is amusingly sleazy... he'll tell anything to anyone if he things it will give him an edge. While it isn't a violent film there are a few tense scenes where one or both of our leads are in real danger. The film isn't preachy about its subject matter, it respects the viewers enough to let them make their own judgements. The cast is solid, most obviously Miles Teller as David and Jonah Hill as Efraim; they have a chemistry that makes it easy to believe they are old friends and that 'good guy' David might go along with Efraim's ideas. Solid support includes a good performance from Ana de Armas as David's wife Iz and Bradley Cooper as established arms dealer Henry Girard. I don't normally comment on a films sound track but this ones includes an impressive number of great, well-known songs. There is a lot of swearing, certainly enough to put some people off. Overall a lot of fun; I'd certainly recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like 'Lord of War'.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

It's based on a true story, and I was curious as to how it'd play out. The path the story takes is an interesting one, and I was happy to see that.The acting is pretty good. Jonah Hill is definitely one of the standouts, and although this definitely isn't an amazing performance, it's a pretty good one. Miles Teller is subtly really good as well. He gets really into this role where he plays the morality of the company, and you can tell that he feels most every line in the movie. He's not trying to fake it like some actors. After the failure that was Fant4stic (2015), I think he was probably seeking redemption somewhere. And he found it here.Unfortunately this otherwise great story is weighed down by it's presentation. In the technical aspect, this is a very bland movie. The way it's shot, the way it handles itself, it's all very generic. Even the writing is a lot of the time. It's just all so mediocre in that sense, it doesn't do really anything with this story on the technical spectrum.On top of that, this is like Plot Convenience: The Movie. There were so many points where I found my wondering how the characters would get out of their situation, only to find out minutes later that everything works out perfectly with some rushed resolution. It got incredibly frustrating after a while and really took away from the movie. I know it's based on a true story and claiming that these events did happen, but I don't care about the source material. I think it's more interesting to see an intriguing, realistic movie and I'd sacrifice accuracy any day for that. Sure, it is possible for a movie like this to have plot conveniences and still make sense, and these still more or less did, but considering how poorly presented the whole movie is it feels like just another Hollywood movie. It doesn't seem real really, and as such it comes off as even more generic and Hollywood-ized when these conveniences present themselves.Overall War Dogs was largely a disappointment. While the acting and story are both near great, the presentation and writing proved lackluster most all the time. In the end I'd still recommend this movie simply for the story.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"It needed a few strippers, minimum.","Yeah, that sounds pretty shallow -- but it's really quite an unsexy movie, both literally and figuratively.Some people deny the similarities both in intent and execution, but it really is impossible not to draw lines between this and ""Wolf of Wall Street"" (2013). But where the latter is entertaining as heck, ""War Dogs"" is surprisingly boring and low key. ""WoWS"" serves up both bigger money, absurd trips on much harder drugs, and a truckload of absurdly attractive and for a large part naked women.War Dogs -- there's basically one woman in the entire movie, and barely any bit parts and extras to speak of. And this character, while played by a beautiful actress, is a whiny, pregnant, self-centered hypocrite (basically your typical modern Western woman).Oh, and there's actual comedy in ""WoWS"". This movie has almost none, and while that could be marketing's fault (the trailer promises an entirely different movie), at the end of the day it's just not very entertaining. It might be that the director's intention was simply to tell this ""true story"" and convey the questionable politics that made it possible, but in that case they should've made a documentary, IMO.I don't think it's a bad movie, really -- just very, very forgettable compared to what you might expect from a cast like this.",,Anonymous,Biography
Pretty sure I've seen this before...,"I'm not going to harp on about this movie much, just go and watch Lord Of War (2005) and you'll enjoy it more than this movie (thank me later). This movie lacks any major character development (beyond that they like drugs and making money) and it's so boring in its presentation that I was just waiting for the moment they would eventually get caught. The acting is not up to much either, basically cut them their cheques and move on. Jonah Hill just plays the same role he's been doing for about 10 years now and it's getting a little boring. You can tell he's got some skills, such as in Moneyball but we just never really get to see it.

War Dogs - Beware lest You Get Bitten,"Not getting into technical stuff for this one - that's already been covered elsewhere - just a comment on content and outcomes.

Bow Wow Dogs,"War Dogs was entertaining enough, but far from anything great or even good. Mr.Hill gave me a headache. He overacts each scene and yells, curses, yells louder and yells even louder the whole movie. Mr.Teller is a snore bore and his performance is nothing to write home about. The film is basically a ripoff of Boiler Room and The Wolf of Wall Street. I can only guess that the eighty million box office take was from teenage and young males. There is nothing appealing about either character and if anything presents a dismal take on the desire to become successful. War Dogs is a Bow Wow...",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Both Too Close and Too Far,"Blink and you'll miss it, but David Packouz, the real life AEY arms dealer responsible for defrauding the federal government, violating international law and being an all-around skuzz-bucket has a cameo in War Dogs. He plays a few bars from Blue Oyster Cult's ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" as Miles Teller (playing Packouz) tries to sell twenty boxes of Egyptian cotton bed sheets to a retirement home manager. In a nut shell, this little moment of quiet desperation is a microcosm for everything wrong with this film. It tries to hint at a larger point, and cakes itself with Goodfellas (1990)-level severity, but the affection director Todd Phillips seems to have for our dunderhead antiheroes, clouds the film's judgment like bleary pot smoke.The true story of David Packouz and middle school chum turned business partner Efraim Diveroli (Hill) was first chronicled in Rolling Stone Magazine. The article and subsequent book written by Guy Lawson details the rise and fall of two twenty-something-year- old's who made a killing (figuratively) procuring guns and ammunition for the U.S. government. Hungry for larger and larger profits, the boys of AEY eventually got themselves caught selling substandard, antiquated and illegal arms to the Pentagon in a debacle known as the Afghanistan deal.Packouz as portrayed by Miles Teller is a well-meaning yet interminably disenchanted young man who is picked up and corrupted by Diveroli and his psychopathic web of gun running schemes. He also provides the narration which acts less of an attempt to weave a mind process within context and more of a plea for sympathy and understanding. ""When Efraim put it that way, there really was only one choice,"" he says in a pivotal moment. A moment that could have given the character some agency but instead continues to shift the blame to Efraim whom we all know is a bad person, he's got the nose for cocaine to prove it darn it!Jonah Hill as Efraim for what it's worth, still comes across likable in a teddy bear meets Scarface (1983) kind of way. He does a lot in vital scenes to keep audiences rooting against him but there's something about his crass, school-yard bully distemper that feels like we're watching a parody of wise guy bravado instead of the real thing. This softens the image of a man who at best is a criminally minded megalomaniac and at worst is a killer (literally).You'd think that in a film about guns there'd be more of them. Unfortunately most of the movie consists of car riding, cellphone talking and pale white faces staring at computer screens sifting through Pentagon orders. When guns do edge into the limelight, they're given a showy, spine-tingling, almost orgasmic quality; with the exception of the screwball Triangle of Death car chase that's highlighted in the trailer. They're basically treated as a triviality; a product meant to be bought and sold with our heroes never really handling them themselves. If guns were replaced by mortgage futures, you'd basically be watching a movie about the least interesting guys in The Big Short (2015).War Dogs is simply too fond of its subject matter. It arms the story with a pugnacious worldview, sits in a shroud of gray and justifies itself by being comical but never satirical. Say what you will about the operatic peculiarities of Lord of War (2005), but at least it had the good sense to show you the consequences of run running on a visceral level. War Dogs by comparison is just confounding and trite. Todd Phillips is quite simply too giddy in this film to ask questions of any substance concerning Department of Defense contracts, weapons manufacturing, and the economy of war. Instead, like a college journalist getting his first big interview, he's simply out of his depth.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

'War Dogs' Proves Life Is Often Stranger than Fiction,"Holy crap.That is my summary of War Dogs. The movie was produced by Todd Phillips–director of the Hangover movies–and Bradley Cooper. The truly crazy part, though, is that War Dogs is real-life. It's a story based on actual events, but if you didn't know that it wouldn't seem much different than one of the Hangover movies.The movie focuses on a two twenty-something friends in Miami Beach who become international arms dealers. Their company–AEY–leveraged a federal website to find and land lucrative contracts with the Pentagon. Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill) and David Packouz (Miles Teller) eventually landed a $300 million contract to arm the Afghan military, but government corruption and some illegal decisions on their part proved to be their undoing.All of this went down only a few short years ago. Diveroli and Packouz–as AEY– were able to take advantage of an initiative implemented by the Bush administration to expand federal contract opportunities to small businesses. In 2011, however, the two were convicted of multiple counts of fraud. Diveroli was sentenced to four years in federal prison, while Packouz was sentenced to seven months' house arrest.If you want all of the salacious details, read the lengthy feature article in Rolling Stone written by Guy Lawson. It was this article that first caught Todd Phillips attention and led to the War Dogs movie project.In a Q&A following the screening I saw, Phillips and Cooper shared some of the back story and their experiences making the movie. Phillips said the project was built around the idea of Jonah Hill starring in from the beginning. In fact, Phillips said that he had actually been trying to work with Hill for years–revealing that he originally tried to get Hill to be in The Hangover as the younger brother. The role was eventually re-imagined as an older brother and given to Zach Galifianakis instead.It seems like a brilliant choice. I don't know how Efraim Diveroli acts in real life, but Hill seems like a natural in the role. Miles Teller also does an excellent job as Packouz–the character through whose eyes the movie is told.If you've seen the Hangover movies, you know how that group of friends manages to get into a lot of trouble resulting from a series of comical errors and bad decisions. That's pure fiction, though. Phillips relayed the story of how he first learned about and became interested in this story. ""I remember, I was literally flying to Bangkok–we were shooting Hangover 2–and I read it in Rolling Stone just like anybody. I just couldn't–the thing that attracted me is I couldn't believe it was real, honestly. It just felt like it was one of those, um–you know, if it was a piece of fiction in The New Yorker I would have said, 'Oh. That's a cool story. Cool characters. But, it's so unbelievable it kind of doesn't work.'"" The Q&A moderator asked, ""Bradley, when you found out about the story, was there anything that really surprised you? Where you were just like, 'This couldn't be true'?"" Cooper replied, ""Oh my God. Where do we start?"" Granted, this is a movie that is ""based on a true story"", which means that there is some artistic license and embellishment for the sake of entertainment. Phillips stressed that this is not a documentary, but also shared that Lawson–who is more familiar with the story than just about anybody other than Efraim and David themselves–expressed that he was pleasantly surprised with the journalistic integrity of the film.War Dogs is an excellent movie. The acting is exceptional and the story is engaging. It is 114 minutes of entertainment that will be worth every penny you pay to see it. The fact that it is somehow a true story of two anonymous young men doing something extraordinary is just icing on the cake.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Funny movie about a serious topic,"""War Dogs"" (2016 release; 114 min.) is ""based on true events"" we are reminded as the film opens. We are in January, 2008"", when we see a guy, Dave Packouz, thrown out of a car and assaulted by what look to be kidnappers. When then move back to ""Miami Beach 2005"", as we see Dave struggle to make end meets as a licensed massage therapist. Then one day at a funeral, Dave runs into his old buddy Efraim Diveroli, who has recently moved back to Miami. Efraim, a small time arms dealer, can use Dave's help with the arms bonanza that is the war in Iraq. Before we know it, the two are starting to sell arms to the Pentagon. At this point we're 15-20 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie, based on a Rolling Stone Magazine article, is directed by Todd ""The Hangover"" Phillips and equally as important, produced by Bradley Cooper's production company (Cooper himself also plays a small role as another shady arms dealer). The movie is divided up in 7 or 8 chapters (I didn't count them exactly) such as ""All money is made between the lines"", and ""When does telling the truth help anyone?"". Miles Teller (from ""Whiplash"") and Jonah Hill are David and Efraim, respectively. Teller looks so young! Hill on the other hand seems he was made to play this role. The movie is billed as a comedy, and yes there are quite a few laughs to be had, as the absurdity of the situation lends itself to easy laughs, There should've been a serous undercurrent as well, about the flood gates opened by the Bush administration to fill billions of dollars in war procurement, enticing second and third tier companies and scammers to get a piece of the pie. (A recent book called Consequence by Eric Fair goes into that aspect as well, and it is not a comedy). last but not least, there is a smorgasboard of music placed throughout the movie, from CCR's Fortunate Son to the Who's Behind Blue Eyes. to Leonard Cohen's Everybody Knows (playing over the end credits).""War Dogs"" is now into its second week, and it did okay at the box office in the first week. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay, not poor, not great. I heard a lot of chuckles throughout the movie, so that was a good sign.

"Familiar and predictable, but it's confidently directed with plenty of energy and enthusiasm","David Packhouz (Miles Teller) is employed as a masseuse but has a burning desire to make a better life for himself. When Packhouz becomes reacquainted with his old friend Efram Diveroli (Jonah Hill) he is given the shot at the big time that he has always craved; Diveroli offers Packhouz the chance to go into partnership whereby the two of them are middle men arms dealers who supply the US Military with weapons. Both men taste success and become very rich, but with bigger contracts comes bigger risks and the two friends quickly find themselves out of their depth...War Dogs is effectively a glammed up version of Lord Of War (another film that I believe was based on a true story). What you get here is a fairly predictable rise and fall narrative, but to be fair Todd Phillips does direct the film with plenty of energy and enthusiasm and I have to admit that I wasn't bored at any point during the film. Although these things do make the film enjoyable and fun to watch I couldn't help but wonder if Phillips was enjoying himself a little too much here; he does tend to embellish a little too much and perhaps glamourises Diveroli and Packhouz more than he should - the way that Diveroli and Packhouz talk about and make references to the film Scarface only reinforces this point - did this really happen or did Phillips throw these references in to justify his glamorisation of the characters and events? Although I've put this forward as a criticism this approach is something that I like more than dislike as it does at least make the film a fairly enjoyable experience.As far as acting performances go then this one definitely belongs to Jonah Hill; he basically channels the same character he played in Wolf Of Wall Street and clearly understands what kind of picture that Phillips intend to make. He was an interesting character who has more faces than Big Ben and is able to become whoever he needs to become to get money or contracts - he has an almost sociopathic charm to him. Teller is OK here, but he's still an actor that I'm struggling to get to grips with and seems to be in Hill's shadow here. Bradley Cooper is pretty flat in his respective role and he looked really creepy in those ridiculous glasses...Despite being predictable, familiar and overly-glamourised I have to admit that this film was enjoyable and the story was quite interesting. Hill's energy, enthusiasm, and the manipulative nature of his character made the film stand out that little bit more and made the journey from A to B perhaps more involving than it could have been. It's nothing special and isn't remotely original, but the 114 minutes that I spent watching the film did pass by fairly painlessly.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

So yet another Martin Scorsese wannabe? So what? At least it was a good one!,"Based on a Rolling Stone article, and subsequent book, by Guy Lawson, ""War Dogs"" tells the improbably true story of how a couple twenty-something meat-heads from Miami gamed the no-bid contract system then-Vice President Dick Cheney put into place to award government contracts. As if you needed any proof that was a terrible plan from the beginning, here come two idiots to prove just how easy it was. Miles Teller stars as David Packouz, a seemingly nice stoner stuck in a dead-end, degrading job, with a baby on the way and no way to support her. Enter his childhood friend Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill), an obvious sociopath and con man with a plan to get rich selling guns through the new no-bid system.There are a lot of problems with War Dogs, but the performances aren't among them..... Teller is always watchable, and even though David is a bit of a wet noodle, and makes for the most gullible narrator in the history of ever, Teller's charm keeps him interesting enough. But Hill is the real standout, going in literal guns blazing as Efraim. Hill does not shy away from Efraim's excess or his pathetic over-doings, and he embraces Efraim's slimy amorality and turns him into what should be one of the great cinematic scumbags, alongside Tony Montana and Jimmy Conway. And that's the problem. As the film moves towards, sneakingly, wanting to pave its intention to copy ""Goodfellas,"" and eventually does, makes it a waste to a somewhat enjoyable ending. So another Martin Scorsese wannabe? So what? (To be fair, eventually everybody rips Marty's Wiseguys or one of DeNiro's classic off at some point in their career).At least this was a good one!The conflict that comes of mouthy, aggressive and woefully under qualified wise-boys-wannabes entering into a world which is clearly more complex than they can instantly comprehend has become a modern dramatic boilerplate – As the American dreamers hammering bureaucratic weak spots for tidy personal gain. Yet where War Dogs offers a cautious celebration of reckless, industrious youth, the film itself is the product of a filmmaker who is utterly unwilling to scavenge for advantageous points of entry. But all that potential is wasted by Phillips' conflicting messages. He wants this to be condemnatory of the ""kill or be killed"" economic mentality that ruined our economy, but he also wants us to care whether or not David and Efraim are still friends. (It's never clear, at any moment, why we should like Efraim at all, let alone hope he has friends.) He wants to excoriate Bush-era policies, but also revel in bros being bros in the Iraqi desert. And, like The Wolf of Wall Street, the economic commentary is compromised by the glut of wealth porn as the boys revel in their fast-made millions.Perhaps fans might have hoped for more comedic moments in ""War Dogs."" Because of Jonah Hill's comedic history (as well as that of Miles Teller), it could easily have been utilised more, which would have strengthened the character development between Efraim and David.Aside from its more obvious predecessors, War Dogs also takes a superficial, but interesting look at the cultural legacy of Brian De Palma's Scarface. Hill's Efraim Diveroli mounts a giant screen-cap canvas of Al Pacino wielding his ""little friend"" on the wall of his office like a moral totem. He references the film, claiming that the pair are akin to high-rolling gangsters, getting things done like money-making machines, leaving the ethics of their endeavour for someone else to deal with. Phillips constantly finds ways to let his heroes of the hook, always taking their semantic swerving at face value. He is loath to just let their criminal conniving be judged as such. There's always the sense that this film will only work if an audience believes that the scampi-sh wars dogs themselves are full- bore idiots, and not pathetic bottom-feeders in hand-me-down cabana wear.And in the tradition of Scarface, Goodfellas, and The Wolf of Wall Street—so basically, all the classic American Scumbag movies — with a dash of The Big Short thrown in for a falsely moralising ending, War Dogs is a sweaty, bro-y, barely even sheepish celebration of Bush- era amorality dressed in coke and cash that squanders a brilliant scumbag performance from Jonah Hill, Miles Teller and a very watchable Bradley Cooper. What more could you ask for? Watch it, it's pretty good if you're in the mood and maybe even better if you're new to the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

War Dogs,"I was so hoping that War Dogs, would be a breakthrough film for writer/director Todd Phillips, much in the way that last year's The Big Short, was not only the most mature film of writer/director Adam McKay's career, but it was also what I would consider to be his best film and it even won him an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, amongst other nominations and honours that the film received. I say this because up till this point, both Phillips and McKay had been known mostly for lowbrow comedies that were obnoxious, crude and featured very juvenile humour and antics which would probably appeal to teenagers and maybe guys in their early 20's, but after that the appeal would greatly diminish within older and more mature viewers. I admit and I have my reviews on this site to prove that I have liked past works by both these directors, but again they were just amusing comedies that I would see once and then probably not bother with again and while humorous and entertaining at the time, they would have no lasting impact, or affect on me other than having a few chuckles amongst the other filmgoers at the theatre. McKay broke through this barrier last year with The Big Short, and now he has plans to do other more serious and yet entertaining films like one he has lined up with Jennifer Lawrence, and while I am sure he will still do his immature comedies, he has proved that he can and has the ability to do more serious and ultimately much better work. Having now seen War Dogs, I can safely say that not only has Phillips shown his truest talent as a writer, director and ultimately as a filmmaker, but I also think like McKay he has made the best film of his career. War Dogs much like The Big Short, focuses on real people and events that unfold before our eyes and the film is very satirical at times and also gives a good commentary on things such as how these two young men could have conned the American government the way they did and basically how easy it was for them to get filthy rich and do so under everyone's noses, or without them being aware. The film looks at war and weapons and how the American government goes about it's daily business with these types of foreign affairs and activities and the filmmakers here give a very critical and sometimes scathing look at such things showing that as voters, citizens and everyday people, we really sometimes have no clue as to what our government officials are up to, or what goes on behind the scenes and it also leaves one thinking that these people must not always be completely competent, or on top of things the way they should have been because otherwise we wouldn't have a film like War Dogs, or a true story and events such as this film depicts because anyone who knew what was going on would have put an end to it a long time ago, or so I hope. The film is just as good as any political spoof, or skewering by offering up many things for us as viewers to both be amazed and horrified at in equal measures. All the while though, Phillips proves he can tell a good story and both make an impact with it and completely engulf us into the world of arms dealings and the seedy goings on that these characters were involved in. The film can be quite humorous at times both in crude ways which Phillips still knows how to do, but yet he improves upon here and yet the film is so riveting that while not a thriller we are still so fascinated by what is going on in front of us that it would be a major mistake to leave the theatre even for a couple minutes and dare miss a second of this riveting story unfolding before us. The film's script is sharp with both it's quite perceptive and sometimes painfully accurate criticisms of what these two men did as well as the failure at the time of the American government, but it also raises good questions about what anyone would resort to and what depths, or lows we might go to in order to make a name for ourselves and be filthy rich even if it means facing major consequences. The acting here from the whole cast is also excellent and some of the finest work of both Jonah Hill and Miles Teller. Phillips has proved he can make one great film and I hope like McKay they continue to make serious and thought provoking films of a higher quality like this and not just go for the easy, or stupid laughs like in the past because in both cases that would be more or less selling themselves out and isn't that basically what they were both against with these two movies? I hope they will continue to work seriously, but as it stands, War Dogs is one of this year's finest achievements and overall best films.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Dogs of War,"Two childhood friends discover that there is money to be made as illegal arms dealers, but an atmosphere of distrust, basic human greed and the dangers of the Middle East get in the way in this vibrant comedy from Todd Phillips. The film is based on the experiences of two actual amateur arms dealers and with voice-over narration plus the presence of Jonah Hill, it is unsurprising that the film has been compared to 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. What made the Scorsese film such a ride though was the narration by a very charismatic Leonardio DiCaprio. Here though it is Jonah Hill, not Miles Teller, who is the charismatic one, and it is hard not to feel that 'War Dogs' would have flowed better with the deeply flawed Hill rather than the moralistic Teller narrating the tale. Tension also peters out somewhat towards the midway point, but the introductory scenes are great and the final 40 minutes are excellent as the plot takes a 'Social Network'-like turn with memorable quips like ""you're just playing the part of my best friend"". This final section of the film is in fact so strong, with the friendship between the pair really tested with so much money on stake, that it almost makes up for all other shortcomings. This is an unquestionably bumpy ride, but excellent chapter headings help pace the material well and Teller certainly holds his own even if Hill dominates every scene he is in.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Not Funny Failure....Obnoxious & Bland Satire About Gun-Running,"A Drama/Comedy about a couple of Real-Life Scumbags (no not Bush and Cheney) but Two Twenty Something Buds who have a Jolly Good Time Making Money Selling War Weapons.The Actual Shooting and Maiming of Real People is Hardly Questioned and left Off-Screen.

A movie for 5th graders to teach them that good always prevails !!!,"What could have been a great anti-hero setup on the war industry like 'Lord of War, turns to be a moral tale of good winning over badThe story starts off well developing both the characters and setting up Efraim as an anti-hero. The Jordan episode cements you to the protagonists and you can only expect the story to get more interesting.

"Pleasantly surprised, but not blown away","It's an enjoyable movie. After hearing some of the early reviews I expected something much worse. Jonah Hill's and Miles Teller's performances are the strongest part of War Dogs, and the story itself (especially knowing that it is based on actual events) is engaging enough that it kept me interested all the way through. At the same time there is nothing special or particularly original about this film. At times it reminded me of some of Scorsese's gangster films, like Goodfellas and Casino, and even The Wolf of Wall Street, but as far as directing or screenplay it is nowhere near those classics. I would definitely recommend it for a watch, but don't expect your world to be shaken.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Fascinating Story,"This film gave me pretty strong ""The Big Short"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" vibes, two pretty brilliant films. I'm not sure why but I just love movies about economics and finance, something about the style these films use and learning about these strange circumstances that were going on not long ago is just fascinating to me and the story of War Dogs is no exception.The acting was all good and I managed to identify with every character, the cinematography was eye catching, the script fun if not entirely accurate to the real life experiences and the ending managed to wrap everything up nicely.While I am a big fan of this genre of film I do sincerely believe that this is a movie anyone can enjoy and learn a bit more about the world through, my only complaint was the use of licensed music, it felt overbearing and unsuitable at points but it did deliver a few great moments.

Brilliant film,"I admit that I was skeptical at the prospect of Jonah Hill making a serious film, but boy was I in for a surprise.The trailer made this film look like a weird drama comedy, something like Knocked Up with an inverted comedy to drama ratio (Knocked Up is maybe 80% comedy, 20% drama), playing up the funny/wacky Jonah Hill parts. The love/relationship aspect of David Packouz could've gone the wrong way and could've gone on for too long, but I think they got everything right.Without spoiling anything (I'm saying what the trailer shows)The business part was fun and intriguing. Smart use of montages to cut time and tell the story quickly, something similar to Breaking Bad's cooking/growing business montages.Their adventures were just the right amount. Enough fun/action/outdoors to not make this a claustrophobic office film where deals are done on phones/faxes/internet.The personal story between the two was good. The family drama, although not my favorite part, made the stakes higher and made everything personal.Shady characters, shady wars, grey market, dirty business and you've got yourself a great picture.There's enough comedy to cut through the drama and not make this a heavy piece.Some may fault it for not saying anything about the war, but it didn't need to. Not everything needs to be an anti-war piece, just as not every film needs to be some chest- thumping flag-'n-anthem patriotic tear-jerking ode. I like that it did neither - this is not some ""USA USA"" film nor some lecturing film that tells us war is bad, or that the Iraq was is bad, something almost everyone agrees with ALREADY (and the rest won't change their minds because of a Jonah Hill film, so why should we all suffer?).This film reminds me of Wolf of Wall Street more than anything, but it has shades of Casino, American Gangster, Catch Me If You Can and American Hustle.I would rate it higher than Wolf of Wall Street, which is too choreographed and theatrical for my taste. This film doesn't overdo this ""look how rich we've become"" because it didn't need to.The story is front and center. There is no time wasted on lavish parties, fireworks, champagne, women in bikinis, etc. It is not a ""homes of the rich"" and arms-dealer mashup. It's just the story of the arms dealers.One of the best films of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
War Dogs,"Director: Todd Phillips
Writers: Stephen Chin, Todd Phillips and Jason Smilovic
Actors: Jonah Hill, Miles Teller and Steve Lantz
My Points: 7,2 - 3½/5
First of, where have Jonah Hill disappeared? I haven't seen him any movie for ages...
And that is a sad thing, 'cause I like him a lot!Maybe he will do a comeback?But on with the review, although I aint got lots to say about it...
Yes, this is a good movie - but there's not much to say.It was nice to watch, when Jonah ""Efraim Diveroli"" Hill and Miles ""David Packouz"" Teller business started to roll on. I was on their side, that it would work.Well, this is a movie - so ofcourse there are potholes.The journey to Bangkok (or what it was, I dont remember anymore) was nice. Intense, and some gun shooting.Bradley ""Henry Girard"" Cooper was a nice addition, I like him.David Packouz wife were hot, Ana de ""Iz"" Armas to be exact.The music were also nice.So overall, a pretty decent movie - not the best, but not the worst...",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
8/10,"""War Dogs"" recounts the true story of David Packouz (Miles Teller) and Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill) and of their society for arms trading, AEY, through the years from 2005 to 2009. From the foundation of it, right through every step in the way that they took in becoming a multi million dollar contract arms trader.Having been sadly underwhelmed in the past years by every feature Todd Philips has put out, I was going into this one not really expecting the surprise I got. This is a fabulous storytelling effort, which, as all great true-story films do, puts the focus on the characters and uses its setting to enhance a film that moves along at a restless pace and with a drive that I as riveted by as much as I was surprised by it.When putting together these kinds of true story films it is very easy to fail from the start by having a murky idea on what is the focal point of your feature. Many movies loose themselves in social and political commentary, others forget completely to give a narrative pulse and worst of all, many of these focus all of their attention on pulling heartstrings solely through the real-events element, which quickly becomes a gimmick.""War Dogs"" does nothing of this, it is a clear vision about these two guys, the story is theirs and it moves forwards with every scene, never being interrupted by out of place moral commentary or in your face explanations of who's right. There is no judgemental approach given to what could very easily descend into blatant accusation. The character empathy you have is really remarkable and even when I thought the film was occasionally tripping I was proved wrong by some genuine revelations and changes in the character dynamic.What this excellent screenplay does is never, not even for a moment, loose you in what is a gargantuan mass of information you have to digest. I can confidently say I could explain everything that went down in the film and the understanding the filmmakers manage to give you to what is going on is all thanks to brilliant storytelling. Firstly, the plot weave is frantic yet crisply ordered, which combined with the fabulous narrative drive injected scene after scene makes for a riveting experience. You are carried through many small stories which each, other than having a brilliant structure in it of themselves, have an incremental amount of importance as the film goes on. Thanks to this the tension in the film just keeps building and building and even I, who did not know anything about the true story, could sense this ominous feeling that something was going to go down. The stakes always increase and with them the closeness to which you get to come with these characters.Jonah Hill and Miles Teller have great chemistry, but even more than that, they stand out on their own. Jonah Hill is once again proving he is one of the great actors of our time and has still loads to do, he is performing again as a guy who basically is an asshole, but once again he succeeds in not making this person a flat, annoying brat, but a complex and dangerous human being. Miles Teller has the less showy role here, but he shines just as much, giving the audience and the film a beating heart to follow. Ana de Armas is another highlight of the film and manages to give life to her character on the screen where many other would have probably been a flat presence.Of the few things that can be taken a part from ""War Dogs"" I just have to say that it does have just a couple of little inconsistencies that jarred me for the moment they were on screen. Furthermore, I have to admit that as much as I loved the chapter division it had I could have done with just a little more style. The editing is quite incredible and the laid-back photography serves the story incredibly well in giving it that open and unapologetic quirk, but I can't help but feel that visually the film did not leave a bit imprint on me, using many traditional and occasionally derivative (Godfather II ending) techniques where there could have been the space to design a visual grammar uniquely for the content.I found ""War Dogs"" to be a fabulous character piece on a great backdrop of story and setting, with thoughtful directing, of which many choices I could have not agreed with on a first, quick thought, but the more I think about such and the more I appreciate the craft behind them.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Yet another take on American rags to riches success story formula,"Yet another spin of the greed is good / rags-to-riches American success story formula pioneered by Oliver Stone's 1987 classic Wall Street"", still heavily used by all the others. This is a true story about 20-something guys (Jonah Hill, Miles Teller) exploiting a little- known government initiative that allows small businesses to bid on U.S. Military contracts during the Iraq War. They begin raking in big money but soon get in over their heads. Also starring, Bradley Cooper, Ana de Armas, Kevin Pollak. This type of movies usually depend heavily on the coolness of the leading actors, and Hill + Teller surely is an exciting combo. Hill's work is especially noteworthy, giving the staple comedy actor a chance to create an unusually multifaceted character, a sociopathic narcissistic dude. War Dogs"" also has the typical weakness of this type of movie: underdeveloped final act. After taking their sweet time showing all about the humble beginning and rise to fame and fortune, the later events are shown in a hurry. Stuff happens because it has to happen, not because the story has evolved to this point naturally. Director Todd Phillips is known for moderately funny but not especially inventive mainstream comedies (Road Trip"", Old School"", 2004's Starsky and Hutch"", School for Scoundrels"", The Hangover"" trilogy, Due Date""). This is his first break from the mold, and surely a refreshing step in new direction. Like some of the best screen stories, ""War Dogs"" is not tied to a particular genre such as comedy or action or drama. It has a bit of everything which has always been one of the most attractive aspects of this type of rags to riches movies. By the way, the poster design is a parody of the iconic poster for mafia classic Scarface"", which is referenced throughout the film; also, Hill was born in 1983 when Scarface"" was released. I don't know if it's really important in some way. It's a solid way to spend nearly two hours, but there's a great number of movies of the same type already.

Good Saturday afternoon film.,"Based on a true story, 'War Dogs' makes a light comedy out of the shady goings-on of the international arms trade. From an acting perspective, Teller and Hill's on-screen chemistry tells the story of a close friendship that clearly goes back a long way and results in an immersive, emotional journey. Editing was, to be frank, better in the trailer than the film - at times, it felt slow; however on a whole 'War Dogs' was fun, punchy and action-packed. The soundtrack had been well thought about and the plot stays fairly true to the story on which the film was based. I'd definitely recommend watching 'War Dogs' with your mates as a fun, Saturday afternoon film but it certainly isn't iconic.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

This Gun Runs.,"After three Hangover films, two progressively worse than the first, and after another shift in the popularity of comedy films, you'd think that we had seen the last of Todd Phillips. But here he returns with War Dogs, a film that doesn't include Tigers in bathrooms, Mike Tyson karaoke, or men over the age of 40 waking up the next morning wondering what the hell they did the night before. This time, it's guns, ammo, drugs, the Iraq War, The Bush administration, fraud, corruption, greed and a group of violent Albanian mobsters. This is no laughing matter. This is Phillips' first attempt at making a truly serious film, while supplying his familiar style of dark comedy. But when you factor in the freeze-frame shots, the narrations, the soundtrack of classic rock tunes, the violence and the drugs, this film is nothing short of a love letter to Martin Scorsese. I kid you not, that's what this film is. Roll your eyes all you want, but it's a style of filmmaking that always works, especially when you're making something based on a true story. Paul Thomas Anderson did it with Boogie Nights, David O. Russell did it with American Hustle, Adam McKay did it with The Big Short.. and so on, and so on. I'll never dislike a movie that attempts to emulate Scorsese, no matter how blatant it could be. War Dogs succeeds with this formula, up to a certain point. When it comes to the political angle that the film takes, it wants you to believe that it's smarter than it actually is. It takes it's aim at the military industrial complex under Bush, but with the rise of a non- interventionalist foreign policy embraced by both parties, thanks to Trump and Sanders, this kind of subject is hardly daring. You're preaching to the converted, Todd. We all know that the Iraq War sucked. The edge is simply not there, but the performances and the writing make up for it. Teller and Hill have tremendous chemistry. They make believable brothers. Jonah Hill in particular is mesmerizing, creepy and totally hilarious. If this was a much better picture, you'd probably be hearing a lot of award buzz surrounding his performance. I really enjoyed Bradley Cooper's interesting bad-guy character. In short, it's a fairly entertaining, fairly long, and not too bad time at the movies, but it doesn't break any new ground, and it's nothing to rave about.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"An Average Affare, Expected More,","War Dogs is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a top notch comedic cast. Jonah Hill and Miles Teller definitely own this movie, their chemistry on screen together is undeniable. There is a great back and forth between them that had me in stitches on several occasions, and they also shined in more dramatic moments when we really get to see these character's relationship.I had expected more, I was anticipating more fun, it took itself quite seriously at times. I understand that it is based on serious events, but it is advertised as a comedy with the same levels of Superbad and The Hangover, so I was not hoping for, nor was I pleased with, long, dragged out dialogue scenes.We do not know who to support in this movie either. David is clearly set up as the protagonist who watches his friend Efraim drive to the brink of insanity. However, David is not a very likable character either, he is greedy and self centered, while he may have some good traits, it's not enough to make him a protagonist we support.It's fun, but very forgettable. It has its flaws, but War Dogs is a good time while it lasts, would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy or crime film, just do not go out of your way to see it.Two lifelong friends receive a contract from the Pentagon to become arm dealers for American troops in Afghanistan.Best Performance: Jonah Hill",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Phillips' post-Galifianakis, pre-Phoenix picture","Right now it seems if you don't have an opinion on Todd Phillips' DC foray you're either dead or Joaquin Phoenix. Having not seen Joker hasn't stopped anyone from offering an opinion to date but journalistic integrity (and frugality and laziness) has driven me to explore Todd Phillips' back catalogue available on Netflix before attending a picture theatre and subsequently diving head first into spurious debate about his latest effort.With titles such as The Hangover (2009) and Due Date (2010), Phillips has previously shown that he can point a camera at Zach Galifianakis. But how would he fair with the Galifianakis-free, true(ish) story of two young arms dealers who hustle their way into a major contract with the Pentagon in War Dogs?Taking a lesser-told story from a secretive industry can be both a blessing and a curse. If we take the main reason we watch films as being 'catharsis' which necessitates empathy with a protagonist and the second reason as being 'to watch something we've never seen before', an inherent problem with ambitious cinema can be that of how to tackle exposition.In tackling this problem, Phillips tries to balance a sympathetic 'everyman' protagonist-come first person narrator with that character's willingness to engage in nefarious acts. And thus the film effectively falls at the first hurdle. While we can all empathise with a young family's desire for stability driving as it does to make money ""between the lines"", moral lines can surely be drawn somewhere soon after the first few million dollars are achieved.Yet the fact that our protagonist has an extreme change of heart late into the Third Act, having been previously complicit in all dubiousness and duplicity which amounted to the films tensions and therefore main entertainments left a sour taste.
While technique, including Fight Club inspired-text-labels for weapons costs sustains the early part and subsumes the necessary exposition, the film's pace drags as it deals with manufactured moral dilemmas now minute in comparison with the margins in which its protagonists are continually working.War Dogs is not without quality. Its cast is adept and its subject matter alone is almost enough to sustain it. However, its reliance on the (non-existent) 'everyman' qualities of its lead protagonist are essentially what diminish this quality.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Teller and Hill showing talent beyond their years,"Without the lead duo, War Dogs wouldn't be much more than an unusual tale dressed up for the big screen; fortunately, the casting is immaculate. Before seeing this, I would have placed Miles Teller (Whiplash, Fantastic Four) in the category of my least favourite actors (a mixture of public persona and previous films), but he has obviously matured since his earlier performances into an actor with quality range. However, Jonah Hill (Superbad, Wolf of Wall Street) is the unleashed personality of the film - a brash personality with expensive taste and an iconic laugh like no other.The storyline follows the leads trying to pave their way into the international arms industry, moving from small-fry deals to bidding on the biggest international contracts. David (Teller) tries to juggle work alongside his pregnant and strongly anti-war girlfriend, whilst Efraim (Hill) drags him deeper into the murky waters of war. The dark horse for me is Bradley Cooper's Henry - a brilliant portrayal of a man who has already crossed ethical lines trying to make money, giving the duo a glimpse of what their futures could end up being.Oddly enough, the soundtrack is one of the most refined cinema has had in years: every track selection captures the scene perfectly, no mean feat given the potential for nearly any scene to morph from comedic to gravely serious. The accompanying scenes of both over-the-top brashness and flaunting of wealth across the globe perfectly captures the public image of arms dealers, making War Dogs an enjoyable romp through the lives of those living off war's inevitability.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Hard to believe but as a comedy it may be successful,"'War dogs' is one of the most anticipated movies of this summer. When I saw the trailer it felt to me that there is so much fun and it will be a good entertainer movie. Casting is also good. Jonah Hill is a good actor but is a very good comedian and Miles teller is a promising actor. It is a ""based on true story"" film so My expectation was huge and as a comedy movie it is good and the story pick up is fair. The title of the film tells you nothing but maybe this is a metaphor.I am not telling this is only a comedy and fun film. The story is very serious and there are good crude and real incident humor are in this movie. So if anyone is searching the seriousness of that issue it will be good. This is the story of two young men, David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli. They won a contract of 300 million from the Pentagon to arm America's allies in Afghanistan. It is a very funny story and the script makes this more interesting. There are lots of real incidents with good political humor and good double meaning dialogues. These double meaning dialogues will make you laugh and the political drama will make you thinking the real reason of the arms dealing.Jonah Hill and Miles Teller has done a very good job and the background score is a perfect matching. The story is good and fresh with good humor. the direction could have been better but not bad. The only negative point is movie's pace. Very slow pace movie and sometimes I felt the continuity is not built well. The story-telling style is also another negative point. It could have been better. Otherwise, it is a good movie.

An entertaining look at some infamous real-world events,"War Dogs is a comedy drama film directed by Todd Phillips which follows two arms dealers, Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz, who receive a US Army contract to supply munitions for the Afghan National Army.This is by no means a memorable film but it serves as platform for two good performances by Miles Teller and Jonah Hill especially the latter who delivers some of the best comic moments of the film.He is almost unrecognizable as Diveroli and Teller and Hill play well off of each other.However the supporting characters come out as rather flat and boring.Todd Phillips is best known for making raunchy comedies like The Hangover or Road Trip but this is his first film that feels more grown up and meaningful.He does a fairly good job here and the cinematography by Lawrence Sher borderlines between flat and breathtaking.There is even a cameo from a particular A-list actor that was enjoyable to see.War Dogs doesn't truly deliver but it is watchable and entertaining enough to keep viewers interested.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The perfect mixture of Pain and Gain, The Wolf of the Wall street and Lord of War","Aaaand I liked it! This spectacular, funny, very entertaining movie based on an incredible and absurd true story. I like Todd Phillip's former comedies but a satire is more complex and it hard to find the golden mean between comedy and drama. I think he succeeded it and War dogs is an excellent onefold entertainment but nothing more, it won't be a milestone in movie-history of course. I would highlight the great performances: Jonah Hill portrays his usual adult-Cartman character, he is funny and fatter than ever so it fits to him. I don't really like Bradley Cooper, but he was excellent again. And Miles Tellerhe is a big question mark for me, I liked him in Whiplash but I am not convinced about his talent. Anyway he was okay in this film (as anybody else would be). The point is that they created a great couple with Hill and the chemistry works between them. Finally I must mention the cool soundtrack, I liked it so much I will gain it! Summary: 10/7 worth to watch! Etc.: catch the cameo of Dan Bilzerian :))",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Really good story told beautifully well !,"I had a chance to see this movie in an early screening. I am not a big fan of Jonah Hills body of work (nor do I hate his work); nevertheless, he has managed to surprise me in big productions like WoWS, Moneyball and Django. He stole the show in this one. He embodied the character so well that I actually forgot that he is the same guy from 21 Jump Street and Superbad. The swag he carried was unbelievable. His laugh is unforgettable! The story is portrayed from the POV of Miles Teller's character David Packouz who is a deadbeat albeit honest bed sheet salesman and a ""certified"" massage therapist who is drawn into a shady world of arms dealing by Efraim (JH). He learns the ins and outs of the trade and helps their partnership grow and make tons of money. What happens during and after is for you to find out. Its an insanely fun ride. Cameo by Bradley Cooper, which btw not insignificant at all, as a sly but deadly operator is also memorable. All in all I enjoyed the movie a lot. Much better than all the superhero mania that's been going around this year. A mark of a good movie is that it keeps you engaged and keeps you wondering what happens next, and it avoids scenes where you go, ""oh, come on!"" (like you did when Superman went, ""Martha!""), and it did all that. Not comparing to any of the blockbusters to be fair, but this movie stands on its own. Go see it!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Dynamite! Jonah Hill Is Da Man!,"Based on a Rolling Stone article by Guy Lawson, 'War Dogs' is a BLAST! Director & Co-Writer Todd Phillips regains supremacy in this racy, darkly funny & entirely amusing criminal comedy-drama, that is bolstered by a compelling performance by Jonah Hill. I had a ball.'War Dogs' Synopsis: Based on the true story of two young men, David Packouz (Miles Teller) and Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill), who won a $300 million contract from the Pentagon to arm America's allies in Afghanistan.'War Dogs' is about achieving ""The Great American Dream"", at any cost. You watch 2 young fellas sweating it out, running around & even literally going nuts in the middle of warfare in Jordan, (The entire chapter in Jordan, is a standout). The two leading-men aren't particularly likable, but its one hell of a ride, to watch them hustle, lie, cheat & steal from all ends. 'War Dogs' is a true-story, that has turned into a terrific film, that keeps you on your seat & swings itself with hilarity & sheer menace.The Screenplay by Stephen Chin, Jason Smilovic & Phillips, is explosive. The narrative arrests you & doesn't let you go. Its so much fun watching the two young bloods doing so much wrong, to get it right. Phillips's Direction is super. Its good to see him back in form, after a hiatus. 'War Dogs' is definitely among his best films to date! Lawrence Sher's Cinematography captures the greed & madness, with fineness. Jeff Groth's Editing is razor-crisp, 114-minutes swing by smoothly. Art & Costume Design are excellent. The brief action-bits are well-done. Cliff Martinez's Score is perfect.Performance-Wise: While its Miles Teller who gets the main role (and also does a voice-over throughout the film), 'War Dogs' still belongs to Jonah Hill. Jonah, an actor who never fails to surprise, is simply fabulous. Jonah sinks his teeth into the part & performs with enviable bravado. He's every bit of the greedy a-hole he plays & gets the best lines as well, who he delivers with his uniqueness. Also, his laugh, is another highlight. Having said that, Miles is quite-good as well, but this is Jonah's show & he owns it. Ana de Armas looks gorgeous & plays the mandatory female influence, with honesty. Kevin Pollak is first-rate. Bradley Cooper shines in an extended cameo.On the whole, 'War Dogs' is a Dynamite! Don't miss it. And how about a 3rd Oscar-Nomination for Jonah?",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Cool to see Hill playing somewhat of a villain!,"'WAR DOGS': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new 'men behaving badly' comedy flick from writer/director/producer Todd Phillips (the man who also brought us 'OLD SCHOOL', 'ROAD TRIP', 'DUE DATE' and all three 'HANGOVER' movies). The film is based on a Rolling Stone article, by Guy Lawson, about two twenty-something arms dealers, that land a U.S. contract to supply weapons to Afghanistan military forces. Phillips directed, co- produced and co-wrote the movie; with Stephen Chin and Jason Smilovic. It stars Miles Teller, Jonah Hill, Ana de Armas, Kevin Pollak and Bradley Cooper (who also co-produced the flick). The movie's received mixed reviews from critics, and it's done mildly well at the Box Office. I liked it, but it's definitely no 'HANGOVER' (it is far better than it's two sequels though).David Packouz (Teller) was working (unhappily) as a massage therapist, in Miami Beach during the Iraq War. His girlfriend Iz (Armas) unexpectedly became pregnant, and David decided he desperately needed a new source of income. So when he runs into his old childhood friend, Efraim Diveroli (Hill), at another old friend's funeral, he learns he can make a lot of money selling guns to the U.S. military (like Efraim already is). The two form a partnership, and get rich (really fast), but they also run into some serious problems.The movie is only loosely based on true events; a lot of it is entirely made up (which makes for a more entertaining film, of course). It's nice to see Phillips branching out as a filmmaker (and I really wasn't impressed with the two 'HANGOVER' sequels), and it's also cool to see Hill playing somewhat of a villain. Teller is perfectly cast as the relatable lead, but he's capable of much more than this though ('WHIPLASH' is one of the greatest movies ever made, in my opinion). This film is fun (at times), and kind of interesting. It's a little too dark, to be a lot of fun though, and a little too light, to be really interesting (in a very serious way, anyway). The performances are good though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/WJl7HNQ4N_4",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A hilarious comedy, that also has some superb dramatic moments.","War Dogs tells the true story of two men in their 20s named, Efraim Diveroli(Jonah Hill) & David Packouz(Miles Teller). Efraim & David realize that they can make easy money, by selling guns & other war equipment to the American military. Soon the two childhood friends make a name for themselves & land a major million dollar contract to sell different kinds of guns & ammunition to the military. However, things don't quite go according to plan.War Dogs is a fantastic film. This movie has many extremely funny scenes. The one-liners will crack you up. However, what really makes this film stand out from all the other adult comedies is that, it has a beautiful emotional core. This makes you care about all the main characters in the film. The dramatic moments in the movie, are as powerful as the comedic moments. The only flaw in this movie is that, it's not as funny as it could have been. The performances are the highlight of the film. Jonah Hill is spectacular as Efraim Diveroli. Hill continues to masterfully balance comedy & drama, after his role in The Wolf of Wall Street(2013). Miles Teller is outstanding as David Packouz. Teller brings an irresistible dry humor to his role. The chemistry between Hill & Teller is effortless. It really feels like they are childhood friends. Ana de Armas is awesome as Iz. Bradley Cooper is amazing in his small yet significant role, as Henry Girard. Shaun Toub is great as Marlboro. Director Todd Phillips has successfully made an adult comedy/drama, after two continuous sequels & four full fledged adult comedies. Kudos! War Dogs is a must watch.

War and weapons are a necessity for some countries,"One of the better movies I saw in the last month and I watch between two and three movies per day. It's an interesting look on the weapon industry. Also the fact that it is based on a true story makes it even more interesting. It's just appalling that almost anybody could trade and sell any gun or ammunition without questions asked. In fact the buyers practically don't even want to know where they came from. The most important is that they can get them cheap. Jonah Hill is funny to watch, even in a bit more serious movie like this one. Because this movie has it's funny moments but it's not really a comedy when you think about the subject. The subject is war and weapons. It's an industry. Whole countries just need wars and weapons business. The USA are in a perpetual war, they are always at war with somebody, and that since they exist. It's a billion dollar business and they just can't afford not being at war. The movie is well shot, with a good cast, and an incredible story.

War Dogs is the definition of 'okay'.,"War Dogs is the definition of 'okay'. It's not terrible but its nowhere near good. It lacks its own identity and the filmmaker struggles to know what it is trying to say, trying to do, or trying to be, including its approach to storyline, the characters and the genre. It doesn't work as a comedy, or a serious drama, and doesn't handle the content well enough to call itself a satire. Still, it has decent performances and isn't too troubling, even if it reminds me of the horror of The Big Short. I am still a little flummoxed as to what the film is/was trying to say, even upon reflection but perhaps that's just my understanding of it. It's a film that will work for some more than others but when you have free tickets, you wouldn't turn it down.REVIEW: http://bit.ly/2bGrDxb",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
War Meets Wolf of Wall street: Teller and Hill Take On Politics,"Robbie K here, starting the weekend off with what elsea movie review. Tonight we jump into the political drama movie that is about our beloved country and those who try to cheat the system to make excessive amounts of cash. So lets bump past the formalities and dive right into my thoughts on War Dogs starring Jonah Hill and Miles Teller!LIKES:  Good chemistry between actors  Interesting story  Comedy is wittyWhen I saw the trailers for this movie, I shuddered to think of the mess this movie could potentially be. After all, both of the actors (while talented) had not been in any roles that I absolutely loved. Therefore I was nervous to see these cast together and the potential stupidity/annoyance that could have been. To my surprise, these two were great together, having a dynamic relationship that sold the characters to me. Hill's brash, aggressive nature led the charge of the movie, but was able to be toned down by Teller's calm, intelligent, and more mature role. Each one was able to balance the others extremes and certainly felt like two coworkers/friends cheating the system. Once more I say that alone these guys were good, but together they were excellent. While the relationship is certainly the driving force of the movie, the story helps keep the pace and suspense going. The story is exactly as sold in the trailers of two young men giving up their mundane jobs to begin selling weapons across the country. Unlike other gun running movies, this film abandons the frontlines for the bank, and feels much like another rendition of the Wolf of Wall Street. Todd Phillips and his team integrated the lives of our characters well into the story while still adding an edge of threat to keep you wondering what would interfere. The many moving pieces keep one engaged in the movie, and while there were components I felt under developed, had enough detail in each to bring things together. Finally the comedy, I was expecting the comedy to be nothing more than a bunch of one-liners and facial expressions to make the next wave of memes. Truth isthere are plenty of these moments, but surprisingly there is some rather witty dialogue that had me laughing. In particular the banter between the two held plenty of clever insults and jabs at American stereotypes. Hill's character in particular had more lines I found funny, mainly by his delivery, but Teller's responses to those lines also assisted with that factor. All-in-all, the comedy has all of the insult and stupidity you expect, but is delivered so well.DISLIKES:  Wanted more Ana De Armas moments  The F word and comedic antics getting old  Underdeveloped parts and the endingMy first dislike is the limitation of Ana De Armas' character. I won't lie, she is a beautiful woman and was very nice to have on screen (hey I am human after all). But I also really liked her character and how she drove the morals of the story despite all the corruption in this film. That goodness could have really refreshed the movie at some of the slower parts and they could have injected some more suspense in the film by having her in the film. Perhaps she isn't the most key character in this war/crime drama, but hey it couldn't have hurtI think.To sound like a broken record, the F word does not equal great dialogue or great writing. Yet Hollywood still can't get that idea through their skulls. War Dogs has moments where it is just one bomb dropped after another, which may not bother you much. Still this reviewer would love the strategic use of the word to maximize its comedy potential, instead of replaying the ploy much like a Hallmark Channel Christmas movie. The same can be said for the comedic ploys in this film, some of which are again beaten to death without much remorse. Jonah Hill's laugh (which sounded like a mixture between the joker and a donkey) in particular grew stale to me and was more annoying by the tenth time it escaped its lips. Fortunately, there aren't too many of these stale antics plaguing the riding.My final limitation was the underdeveloped components of the film. I've already stated the Ana De Armas parts, but there were other components I felt were in need of some fine tuning. The Bradley Cooper character I expected to have a bigger role for the price tag he carries and the way they snuck under the government's nose was a bit far-fetched as well. In addition, the fact that this is all based on a Rolling Stone article left me wondering how much was true and how much of this was Hollywood magic and fantasy. And as for the ending, it is a little lackluster and I would have thought more ploy, drama, and actual footage would have been in the film. Not to mention the final scene was ambiguous and unnecessary.The VERDICTWar Dogs was much better than I expected and really portrays the actions some may take to make a quick buck. While certainly not the most original or entertaining movie, the engaging characters will keep you entertained and the dialogue will have you laughing. However, these qualities are not enough to recommend a trip to the theater for most of the audience members. Only those with great capitalistic pride and who don't mind American political jabs should venture into this movie, otherwise wait for the Redbox rent.My scores:Comedy/Drama/War: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Enjoyable movie with rich storyline,"War Dogs (2016) is a crime comedy film directed by Todd Phillips and written by Stephen Chin, Todd Phillips, and Jason Smilovic. The film stars Jonah Hill (as Efraim Diveroli) and Miles Teller (as David Packouz) as two young men who become arms dealers during the Iraq War.""War Dogs"" is a cinematic masterpiece with crystal clear and crisp cinematography that brings scenes to life in a dynamic, yet not overly exaggerated way. There were various interesting shots, e.g., close-up shots, medium shots, shoulder level, knee level, incorporated in this movie making it more interesting to watch. Moreover, slow-motion effects are particularly striking, combined with smooth transitions that showcase Todd Philips' talent. The color palette is very well-chosen, adding depth to the visual storytelling.The soundtrack by Cliff Martinez is a standout feature, brilliantly blending various genres to complement the narrative. From the mysterious and spooky opening track to the gritty Dutch house electronic music, the selection is diverse and impactful. The music is so varied that it also includes Indie Rock, acoustic guitar music, hip hop, and jazz, creating a multi-genre experience that is both impressive and memorable. I believe it is hard to find the specific song for each scene making the movie contain multi-genre songs from electronic to something different. It was well-done.The story itself is engaging and well-crafted, with meticulous attention to detail. Set in 2006-08 but filmed in 2015, the inclusion of period-specific elements like flip phones and old versions of Computer OS adds authenticity. The sound mixing is balanced and enhances the overall experience.David Packouz's character, known from the Divergent movies, is particularly well-portrayed, standing out as a highlight. The story narration by David is reminiscent of Scorsese's style, a technique that adds depth and perspective to the film. The actors did genuinely a really great job in acting. There was a sense of great character development.The base story and historical context of ""War Dogs"" is another strong aspect, mirroring real-life scenarios. This makes the film particularly interesting for students of International Relations and contract law, providing a unique lens through which to view these subjects.In conclusion, Todd Philips has done an amazing job with ""War Dogs.""

Good movie but structure is very unoriginal,"The basic structure of this movie is something we have seen before in movies like ""goodfellas"" and ""wolf of Wall Street"". It's basically the same the main character as a narrator. The movie starts off somewhere in the middle for a brief scene to show you what to come and then goes back to humble beginnings. And the structure goes on the same so if you have seen those movies then except the same kind of film. Despite that unoriginal I still enjoyed the film. The acting was solid Jonah hill delivers another solid performance adding to the list of his good performances. And young miles teller shows he can act with this and his previous movie ""whiplash"". I was afraid of the movie based on the trailers being just a silly action movie but I was wrong although it had some action it was mainly an interesting story excited well. If you are fans of goodfellas and wolf of Wall Street you will enjoy this because it is very similar with a new story to tell about shady young stoners attempting to screw the government in the arms industry. I do recommend this. Parents beware there is violence and drug use are the main causes of this being rated R",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Undelivering, scattershot true life dramatization","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the summer of 2005, David Packouz (Miles Teller) makes a living on Miami Beach, giving back massages to wealthy clients for peanuts. Then, at a family funeral, he crosses paths with Efram (Jonah Hill), a brash young guy of about the same age, whose made a killing by making online arms deals of depleted army stock that the US government no longer needs, and wants to bring him in on the deal. But as the boys delve deeper into this murky world, the risks get greater and everything conspires to fall apart around them.When it comes to war, and the politics and motivations behind it, we're living in a far more cynical, acutely self aware age, where people are no longer falling for the jingoistic, stirring rhetoric used to whip up support for it, and can see beneath the surface of what it's about just fine. And so a different type of film emerges, in the shape of War Dogs, where our heroes aren't rounded, noble figures, but shady, arrogant ba$tards who are really operating behind the scenes. Sadly, despite the potential, the film isn't the soaring hit it should have been.Director Todd Phillips seems to have a background in mainstream comedy films, including The Hangover series, and while this is billed as a comedy itself, the darker tone and more uneasy subject matter make it harder to see in this way. Performances wise, Hill has never played his obnoxious American arsehole act to such great effect, making his Wolf of Wall Street character practically Paddington Bear, whilst Teller provides fine support as the slightly more restrained other guy. There is a neat sense of style, savvy Goodfellas style narration and some cool dramatic moments, but none of it comes off in quite as coherent and satisfying a manner as one would have hoped.If you want a film with a morally conflicted protagonist making a killing during war time, Lord of War with Nicolas Cage (which, ironically, was released in the year the film is set) is a more satisfying option. **",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

The performances are amazing aswell, Jonah Hill is outstanding in this film and he really does prove that he can act so well, Miles Teller quickly became one of my favourite actors after this film and Whiplash were so good, his performance is so simple but so effective.

An objective review,"This movie being somewhat about war and not having a lot of action, the ""plot"" (even if inspired by a true story) had to be really good. But I found myself bored during most of the film... It has really good actors and I gave it a 5 because I feel like if war history and the US military etc interests you I guess it's worth the watch. The cinematography is good but I don't know... So many amazing movies have been made about these kinds of subjects, and I don't like grading a movie based on comparison with better ones, but I feel like when a subject is used that often in movies, yours has to have that ""something"" that makes the viewer want to watch this specific movie and not another.

This years we wish we were Goodfellas,"Let me start by saying I'm not sure why they have tried to label this movie a comedy. It really isn't funny nor does it seem like a comedy in any way shape or form. Like much of Hill's earlier work, it's just not funny. It's another Hill movie where he is type caste into the roll where he is some sort of sleazy bad guy doing anything for money. Not sure why he keeps getting those rolls as frankly, he's not every good in them. There are drugs, they drop the F bomb a whole ton because you know those things are ""cool"" and are what make a movie, and there of course there is the back drop of a story about guns. If you can't tell i'm being sarcastic there. The whole movie is shot in the same style and manner as GoodFella's was, much like wolf of wall st tried to copy (but came up short) and they are obviously trying to capture into that style of movie. To be honest the movie idea is interesting in the sense that it goes into the story of these two guys running guns based off a true story. But it really falls short in that you can see right through the movie as being another type caste movie of that type. There is nothing ground breaking in this movie and frankly the casting simply isn't that good. Hill frankly just isn't capable of really pulling off these characters (I'm kind of shocked people are still putting him in movies), and his co-star is really a sub par actor not capable of really playing the other side of the role. There are a lot of reasons why this movie seems to sink. The bad acting is one of them, but the main reason really seems to be on the script. We have seen this story before.....many times before. It's old and worn. They added nothing really new to it, and frankly didn't do it nearly as good as the ones that really stand out that were done before it. There really is a lot missing here in order to really make this a must see movie. I don't know if the story itself is just not that interesting to actually be put on film or that they couldn't do anything creative with it. What I do know is that none of the characters stood out and make me think that will be an epicly remembered character or story line. It's something to watch if you are bored but if you are looking for a good movie, this simply isn't it. In a summer full of really disappointing and bad movies this is another one to throw into the trash can.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Most Underrated Movie of 2016,"War Dogs was one of my most anticipated movies of 2016 it looked like it could be the next Wolf of Wall Street and while it definitely didn't reach those heights I still think that this is an amazing movie and a very underrated one at that. I've always been interested when comedic directors decide to take on more serious projects and while this still has plenty of comedy in it this is still a drama and Todd Phillips knocked it out of the park he's amazing at keeping a fast pace during both the arms dealing scenes and action sequences. While there isn't a whole lot of action sequences in this film but when there is it's extremely entertaining and they've got a lot of tension to them because you can tell neither of these characters have seen up close what they cause with the weapons they sell. You get the risks of the business they're by it just being implied but when they get involved with bigger fish like Bradley Coopers character you can really tell what they've gotten themselves into. While you never respect what Miles Tellers character does you understand why he's doing it to provide for his family and make a name for himself, these are motivations that anyone can get behind and makes him more relate able as a character. Miles Teller and Jonah Hill both have fantastic chemistry with each other they defiantly feel like life long friends who slowly start to lose their friendship to their business. While Miles Teller was great Jonah Hill was really the man who stole this movie he's very reminiscent of Gordon Gekko in this film he's obviously hilarious that's something we've come to expect from Hill but he's surprisingly a very intense character in a few scenes and that's something we've never really seen from him. There are a few flaws with this movie and the biggest one of the subplot of Tellers characters wife, it's just not very interesting and just amounts to a few scenes of arguing between them in the end. Bradley Cooper in the end is really just fine in this film he's a bit bland but did what he had to.War Dogs is an amazing film it's entertaining and hilarious with mostly great performances and an interesting story. Defiantly disagree with the critics on this one.92%/A",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
gun runners,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you the extreme risks and hurdles you go through as a gun runner in order to help any form of military. The direction and screenplay are both really good. The casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ignore the 7.1/10 rating.,"This movie is a banger. I mean I have watched this movie a zillion times(metaphorically) but if I would get a chance to watch it I would definitely be ready. This movie has a perfect starting and it perfectly aligns with the ending. I am in love with the movie.Another thing that I would appreciate is the cast. Milles Teller and Jonah Hill with Anna De Armos had a great cast.I don't know why but this movie is underrated. It should be a trending movie but yeah due to its ""illegal"" story it will always be repressed under other movies. I am and will always be standing with the movie.I don't want to spoil this review. You should go and watch the movie yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"No drama, no comedy",This's really boring movie. Theme is not enought explored by director. No empathy with characters because it's everything cliche. Not enought funny moments for comedy and too nonsensical for drama or good crime. You can live without watching it.,5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Movie,"What can I say? Going into this movie I thought it was going to be another old Jonah Hill movie. I was surprised to see that it wasn't anything like that!To begin, the film is based off a true story which makes the film seem much more surreal. This kept me on the edge of my seat throughout certain sections of the film. This added to the excitement of the movie.Miles Teller & Jonah Hill working together was wonderful to watch, The chemistry between them was wonderful.Bradley Cooper wasn't in the movie all that much but played a key role and did that very well.Miles Teller's character you could relate to he was like any other guy. He was a message therapist who somehow within months became absurdly wealthy selling firearms.Jonah Hill's character was interesting, he swore lots but was also very educated and sly. He loved to play with the minds of others which added depth to his character. This was why his character stuck out to me.So in the end should you rent or buy War Dogs?Yes it was a interesting movie about the other half of the world that we do not usually see.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nice,"This is not really a review, it should be taken more as a collection of impressions of the film.Biographical film that beautifully and captivatingly tells the story of two young men who have made their way into the arms trafficking market. The film is generally very well structured even if from my point of view it justifies the youngsters too much and makes one of the two protagonists really too evil, but otherwise the film is really very beautiful and entertains an exaggeration thanks to some truly very fast and dynamic that enrich the film. So in conclusion the film is very nice and funny, realy nice.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"War dogs is a fun, blast of relief to a pretty bland summer movie season","War Dogs is many things and bad is not one of them. This film is a ray of sunshine on the recent filmography of Miles Teller who not to mention gives the best performance (so far) of his career and Jonah Hill was a great choice for this role and I think he had a blast playing Efraim. Now where I think this film loses steam a bit is the love story which I think could have been handled a little better, but especially for an action movie romance subplot is was OK. I also thought that Bradley Cooper's character was quite underrated and was a lot more than the throw away character he was going to be. In conclusion, this was one of the best films in the summer of 2016 and it is definitely going to be on my personal list of the top 10 films of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of it's kind,"War Dogs is an interesting movie. There's not many films out there that deal with arms dealers and even fewer, if any, could be considered a comedy. As a comedy though, it's a little lacking. Hill's character feels like an exact copy of his character in Wolf of Wall Street. Not necessarily a bad thing, it just feels like it doesn't have too much originality to it.I think the best thing the film has to offer is the chemistry between Teller and Hill. They both deliver great performances and when they are both on screen together it is great. In fact it's not just them, all the characters in the film are well cast and all do a great job.Now the movie is about 2 criminals who are selling weapons/munitions to the US government during the war. With a summary like that, you'd think it would be a little darker or more serious. It's very lighthearted with a story that could have been a lot more deep and even funnier.Overall it's not a bad movie. It's not a great movie, it's slightly better than OK. I just think it needed to play it a little more serious and not make some of the characters seem so likable.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

True story-based comedy is only half as smart and funny as it should be,"Todd Phillips, the director and writer behind the successful 'Hangover' trilogy along with a string of less memorable comedies, is one of the last people you would expect to tackle on more serious subject matter like international arms dealing. Though Phillips doesn't abandon the comedic territory, this film marks a slightly different direction than his typical repertoire; a film that taps into the political satire of war, arms dealing, and the fateful consequences that ensue. The main problem with this however, is that Todd Phillips seems lost in balancing his translating of the inspiring true story and mix of raunchy and dark, cynical humor. By the end of its 114 minutes, it all transpires to a half-baked comedy that barely succeeds to generate good laughs while struggling to make a crucial point about the repercussions of international arms dealing.So this film follows the true story of David Packouz (played by Miles Teller) and Efraim Diveroli (played by Jonah Hill), two Miami natives who reunite as friends after many years of no see. Upon their reunion, David learns about Efraim making millions of dollars from illegally selling firearms online to the Afghan military during the height of the Iraq War. David reluctantly joins in on this and together these friends began making a fortune off of capitalizing on illegal arms sales under a fraudulent contract. In the process, they come face-to-face with some shady figures including an expert arms dealer Henry Girard (played by Bradley Cooper).Todd Phillips attempts to drive this rags-to-riches story in the same wheelhouse as last year's 'The Big Short' which tackled on the financial crisis of 2008 while incorporating an exhilarating mix of humor and potency. Adam McKay however, conducted his subject matter fairly more superior than Todd Phillips does with the true story about two unlikeliest of illegal gun runners. As exhibited in 'Lord of War' starring Nicolas Cage and Jared Leto, illegal arms dealing is a dangerous game; one wrong move is all it takes for everything go south. Phillips has the potential to flourishing a story of full of substance if not without some good laughs to provide a side of levity. Unfortunately, the film not only fails sketch out an effective political satire of its subject material but fails to dig deep into the politics behind international arms or the consequences behind the shady business. Phillips delivers a rather uninteresting approach the real-life tale in a way that deprives from the dynamics of the arms dealing industry including the political controversy triggered by the government spending millions of dollars on fraudulent contracts since 2003 when the U.S launched an invasion in Iraq. Beyond a pinch of social commentary on the Bush Administration and the established greed and corruption of the lead characters, the film barely reaches any dynamic heights.For a film dealing with the corruption and ill morality of arms business, Todd Phillips at least does a fine job on establishing a comedic field along with the chemistry between leads Miles Teller and Jonah Hill. Though a good portion of the jokes are bit hit-and-miss and their level of humor never elevates to the standards of the typical Todd Phillips fare, these likable leads foster almost enough laughs to make up for its faulty script. In comparison to the ""Wolfpack"" in the 'Hangover' trilogy, the characters do not indulge in the same type of raunchy R-rated vulgarity, largely in favor for a slightly more cynical tale than an average comedic farce. Miles Teller, as charismatic as an actor he is, boasts a likable portrayal of the reluctant David Packouz who gets involved with his buddy Emrail Diveroli's immoral schemes. Diveroli himself is granted by a fine comedic performance by the ever-charming Jonah Hill who bears a solid barrage of bold-mouth vulgar one-liners and political bashing commentary against the Iraq War. Cuban actress Ana De Armas delivers a fine portrayal as David's worried wife who grows hungry for info on the nasty schemes her husband getting involved in, but perhaps isn't given a whole to do, nor is the 'Hangover' star Bradley Cooper as the shady arms dealer who the duo must face when they make an ill-adviced contract deal.War Dogs is a middling rags-to-riches comedy that may generate some laughs to please moviegoers pursuing for an engaging comedic experience, but suffers from Todd Phillips's trite execution on its true story-inspired. Though this film definitely does make for a pain-no-gain experience, the overall results fail to measure up to anything memorable or even clever.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Totally worth it.,"From the director of The Hangover trilogy comes a less comedic feature based on true story. but because its less comedic doesn't mean its not good, Its really entertaining and exciting. Out of all Todd Phillips work i like War Dogs better as this film has a good story line based on true events and humor; and it features some of the controversial topics as government arms deals and stuff. Good performances by Oscar Nominee Jonah Hill and Miles Teller, also good chemistry in the movie. Both have showed real talent over the course of these years with their features.

Not Illegal,"In ""War Dogs"", Jonah Hill's Efraim says, ""Just because it's not legal, doesn't make it illegal."" Director and writer Todd Philip's ""War Dogs"" is smart, hysterical, and ultimately sad. It is based on a true story about two twenty-somethings (Miles Teller and Jonah Hill), who win a $300 million U.S. Government contract to supply arms in the War in Afghanistan. Phillips wrote the screenplay with Stephen Chin and Jason Smilovic based on a ""Rolling Stone"" article by Guy Lawson. The bizarre truth trumps fiction.During the Bush Administration, the ""Cheney Law"" allowed for small independent contractors to bid on U.S. Government armament contracts. Often these contracts were for weapons that were illegal or not readily obtained. So essentially the system is rigged; it encouraged entrepreneurs to leverage the heavy lifting of the arms black market. The Government doesn't care as long as they get their weapons, but just don't get caught. This is a big ""but"".Phillips brilliantly captures with hypocrisy and whimsy the turmoil engulfing his guys, David (Teller) and Efraim (Hill). The dudes openly chose this work, and the possible consequences. However, the money is not easy to dismiss. In an Albanian warehouse David and Efraim verify that the $100,000 additional cost will result in $3 million more profit. Hill provides the right arrogance and paranoia in Efraim, who loves living large. Teller reminds of a young John Cusack. He is the decent everyday man caught up in overwhelming circumstance. Teller as David is knowingly seduced by the dark side, and he shows remnants of his noble conscience. Here that makes a difference for us. David is also beholding to Iz (solid Ana de Armas), his girl friend and mother of their child. Iz seems to believe whatever benefits her—perplexing to David. Bradley Cooper has a showcase role as slick arms dealer Henry Girard. Cooper amazingly balances Henry's ruthlessness offset with a weird code of honor. Cooper's performance punctuates a theme of the movie that things are not always what they seem.""War Dogs"" is visually stunning. There are magnificent aerial shots of the Jordan desert as the dudes cross the ""Triangle of Death"" to deliver Berettas in Iraq. The scenes in dark and cold Albania express the starkness and emptiness of the mood. The visuals enhance the exacting details of Phillip's story.Predictably, ""War Dogs"" is a cautionary tale. However, it is told with wit, humor, and a sense of compassion. The hypocrisy lies within the system. And here are two guys making a fortune. Teller, Hill, and Cooper are great. ""War Dogs"" is worth a watch and more thought.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Implausible and awkward portrayal of the real-life story,"While both of the leads (Miles Teller and Jonah Hill) make an unlikely pair, the unusual career field they find themselves in seems even more unlikely. Admittedly knowing next to nothing about the arms business or military contracts, the two somehow prove quick studies and soon find they're in way over their heads (lowest bidders in a multi-million dollar contract to supply millions of rounds of ammunition to the US Department of defense).""War Dogs"" is based on a true story, so we know that part happened. What is never explained is how two such bumblers could ever fool anyone to get themselves in such an unlikely situation...Miles Teller takes a backseat to Jonah Hill's mouthy character, and seeing the idiotic way Hill handles his first foray into ""arms sales"" would make anybody thinking about doing business with these two, make tracks in the opposite direction. Hill's character is a braggart, a loudmouth, and far too over-confident in situations that get increasingly implausible as the movie progresses. Hill's character exudes all the competence of a chimp with a gun as he makes bigger and bigger arms deals and instantly turns himself into a clownish figure that NO. ONE in their right mind would buy a box of pencils from - let alone several million dollars worth of ammo.Given a real-life backstory that was ripe for parody, or at least satire, this movie could have been something else entirely then it really is - an absurd, unrealistic, and mawkish story about a couple of real idiots who happened to get very lucky.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

Exceeded my expectations,"I wasn't too sure what to expect going in to 'War Dogs'. I had put off seeing it for a while. The trailers hadn't really done a lot for me. I'm a huge Jonah Hill fan, but Miles Teller I could take or leave. Todd Phillips in the director's chair is almost always a sign of quality though, so I knew I'd get around to seeing it eventually. I finally got around to it tonight and now I regret waiting so long. What a great movie.Firstly, it finds the perfect balance between comedy and drama. If anything it probably leans more towards the dramatic side of things, however there are plenty of laughs, mostly thanks to Hill's terrific comedic timing. Secondly, what I had feared might be a bit of a bland story actually works very well. It's simple enough to appreciate and never strain your brain over, yet complex enough to be fascinating due to it being based on a true story. It reminded me a lot of 'The Wolf of Wall Street', simply minus all the sexuality that film contained.I can see the argument being put forward that none of the characters were likable, but it's not a film that's ever trying to make them likable either. The film doesn't need us to root for them, it simply wants to take us on their journey. Other than that I can't see a lot of areas that you could poke holes in this film. It's well-directed, well-acted, well-written and just an all around fun time to be had.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Arms Contracts Equal Bucks: Makes the Drug Trade Look Like a Lemonade Stand,"Recently on the television show ""American Greed"", the story of Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz trading firearms and ammo to the US government was showcased as a morality tale of greed beating out common or good sense. Although both were against the US-Iraq War, Doveroli and Packouz decided market profit eclipses domestic moralizing. The US government was at war, and there were people in the world who were going to profit by dealing arms and ammo to those engaged in the fighting. The dirty little secret about war: there are many who profit largely whenever a superpower goes to war. The kind of money made in arms dealing as compared to something like illegal drugs, makes the latter look like a few lemonade stands.David Packouz (Miles Teller) was a massage therapist and occasional seller of high-quality blankets to the elderly. He doesn't make great money at either endeavor. He chances to meet his former school buddy, Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill in an award-caliber performance) at a funeral. Diveroli has been in illegal drug trading, but has found a more lucrative market: dealing in used weaponry and selling to the most fanatical gun enthusiasts on the planet: the United States Military. They find used weapons at wholesale and then resell online and to the US Government. His small company was called AEY Inc.Because the US is at war in Afghanistan and in Iraq, there is a shortage of munitions supplies. Diveroli discovers there's a US website detailing hundreds of requests for munitions. With governmental approval, anyone can sell the munitions to the US Military. At first everything is on the up-and-up. But they are mainly getting the crumbs while the larger manufacturers are getting the bigger pieces. The crumbs are worth millions but the thing is, the larger contracts are worth in the hundreds of millions. They even get a silent partner/backer Ralph Slutsky (Kevin Pollack).At a conference on firearms in Las Vegas, Diveroli and Packouz learn they may be in over their heads as they can't compete with the large munitions companies. Until Packouz meets with the notorious arms dealer Henry Girard (Bradley Cooper). Girard tells the novices several pieces of information which in this business can turn into hefty profits. (While I don't always agree ""knowledge is power"" only ""potential power"", in this case, the first one with the map to the treasure could win) Firstly, there's a shortage of AK-47 ammunition, needed especially for the Afghan army in the Middle East. Secondly, Girard knows where he can procure a large quantity of 150 million rounds of ammunition. The last piece is that Girard can't do business with the US Federal government, probably because he broke trade regulations. (Girard is probably loosely based on Swiss arms dealer Heinrich ""Henri"" Thomet.) Girard proposes to the newbies that he will sell them the ammo he has access to. If AEY can broker the deal to sell 150 million rounds of ammo to the US government, the deal is potentially worth $2/round, in other words about $300 million. It will be the largest deal AEY has ever brokered. The question is: will the US government fork out hundreds of millions to two twenty-something arms traders who have been in business for less time than a typical baseball season?A thoroughly compelling film. Aspects are a bit like some of Martin Scorsese's offerings with voice-over and occasional freeze frame. The voice-over by Miles Teller helps us understand all the pieces of the arms-dealing world. Some aspects were fictionalized but many of the details of some of the deals are accurate, especially the one worth $300 million. All acting is solid, particularly Tellers as Packouz and Bradley as Girard. However, a fantastic and believable performance by Jonah Hill as the guiding force behind AEY. Definitely one of Hill's best acting performances. A fairly underrated film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"War is like a business zone, anyone can start-up a business.","Ten years ago a similar film was made with Nicolas Cage in the lead called 'Lord of War'. This was based on the two youngsters who got into arm dealing, but many events were fictionalised. War is a business and these two made lots of profit out of it. So it all begins when financially struggling David clueless about raising his unborn child. At a right time he meets his old friend Efraim and decides to partner with him to supply arms to the US army abroad in a small scale. But when they saw a big opportunity, they decided to give it a try. From the obstacles, they go the extra mile to achieve it. But not knowing how serious the consequences are, finally they step into a dangerous turf and from there, what follows is revealed in the remaining parts.This is really amazing film. Obviously a slow start, but like after 10-15 minutes later it gets better and better. For these actors, this is something big and they have done it excellently. Jonah Hill was simply unbelievable. Kind of good, as well as negative, totally unpredictable character. Mile Teller was superb, he narrated the story with the opening scene, gun pointed at him, the flashback begins. While the story keeps developing, it only gets crazy and crazier. Nearly two long was never been an issue, because of the good pace, as well as for the off beast storyline.Lately I have been seeing lots of Ana de Armas, quite a coincident to watch some many films of someone in a short time. Anyway, her role in this was small, but she was decent. From the director of 'Hangover' trilogy, I think one of his best films it is. If you like the American Dream themes like 'Pain & Gain' and 'Wolf of Wall Street' about making dollars in a fast way risking everything, you would enjoy it as well. Like those two, it was also a comedy, despite inspired by the real. One of the film posters imitates the 'Scareface', but there's a strong reason for that, so you should watch it. Definitely worth a watch, so I suggest it!8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jonah Hill shines,"War Dogs is a type of crime film you have certainly seen before, but what makes it so enjoyable at times, is the talent behind it, even if they can't make it quite as unique as the story they are telling. Miles Teller and Jonah Hill star alongside each other as the leads of this film, and both do a fantastic job, namely Hill who is as good as ever. Hill, besides playing a sociopathic character throughout the film very well, also gained almost 50 pounds for the role, which is not only astonishing, but also very impressive. The film is directed by Hangover and Old School director Todd Phillips, who would also come to direct one of my personal favorite flicks, Joker in 2019. His direction is on point in this film, but I do feel like the overall tone of the flick seems to mimic others of a similar genre and subject matter, and I just wish it was a bit more memorable. The pacing can also be a bit slow at times, notably more so towards the conclusion, but for the most part, the film can be amusing, and solidly interesting through and through. Bradley Cooper also provides a small, but very notable performance throughout the film as Henry Girard, and I was also a fan of the soundtrack throughout the flick, with its nostalgic taste in tunes, as well as its often admirable cinematography. In the end, War Dogs is not the most original crime flick out there, but it certainly has a few impressive tricks up its sleeve, and for most, it is worth the casual viewing it seems to desire.

Missed Opportunity (sigh),"DisappointmentWe have a great story that never received rightful promulgation--- never told the way it should have been. What a missed opportunity.Where do i begin.First, i would start with the script. Who's idea was it to take a Dramatic story and make it into a ""weak comedy?"" We're talking about a true life ""high stakes game"" of international arms dealing. You got a malignant narcissistic ego maniac, a nice guy (down on his luck) and holes in the check balance system of the MIC (Military industrial complex). How can you Lose?...you try and make the story into a comedy.Second, the Acting. Efrims character; Jonah Hill. Either Hill can't act or his lines for his role are badly written...I think it was both. Instead of drawing this malignant narcissist ""Efrim"" out into the full audience view, displaying what a true criminal he is, the director chooses to characterize him as some jolly goof ball who's supposedly ""deep down"" good at heart. The Truth is Efrim is a greedy fat pig who's never been called out for being the pathological liar that he is. The director should have made it a ""focus point"" to draw that character in full color without any misgivings. Instead, the character is presented as some jolly-ole good old boy from junior high that's really a cool guy (deep down). This is where the film goes wrong. Instead of creating tension between the predatory narcissist Efrim taking advantage of the Nice guy Packouz, we are led to believe the Narc was really deep down a good guy until the end. Again taking a made for Drama movie and turning it into a Comedy---big mistake.The Main Character Packouz, Played by Miles Teller actually does a decent job of playing the protagonist whos' been victimized by his dirt-bag ""fake"" friend. He's good hearted, helps his friend make millions, gives him good advice ""hey, don't mess up this deal, we're all making money, Henry's making his cut, just roll with it....if you do i'm out of here!"" But in the end, like most nice guys gets screwed by his lying fake friend. As example illustrates, Efrim ignores Packouz advice and plays the greedy scrooge that he is and almost gets Packouz killed in the process. If the Director has spent more time developing Packouz's character with more intimate emotional insight his dreams, hopes and motives, the movie would have been much better. Instead, he leaves us with dumb witted arguments between Packouz and his Cuban Girlfriend (a completely unrealistic idealist dreamer). Their discussions are so bad the audience is left to wonder ""who's the dumber?""There are some well done scenes but they are far and few between. Bradly Cooper brings some life to the movie but its a ill fated effort. In the final Scene where Henry (Bradly Cooper) and Packouz meet by fate, we see decent acting between the best actors of the movie. Jonah Hill was a disappointment (probably more due to the script his was given and less so to his acting ability) however Hill has never really been impressive as an actor. If you have to pay for a movie, pass on this one.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wolf of Wall Street with guns,"Here's my review of "" war dogs "" , so war dogs is this story about two childhood friends who team up and become illegal arms dealers for the penatagon aka war dogs , this movie has so many funny jokes as well as one liners from Jonah hill and this guy stole the show inspite of Bradley cooper being a part of the movie .miles teller did a good job too , but Jonah hill got the upper hand and his one liners were so funny like "" hold your tummy and laugh "" kind of funny and the supporting characters were good followed by a great screenplay and great dialogues ,I couldn't find anything bad about it , as soon as as the movie started , it didn't waste time on setting up characters and it jumped right to the plot within a few minutes.During the movie I felt as if I've seen these jokes and the cinematic touch somewhere and I realised that the movie was directed by Todd Phillips , the director of the hangover trilogy and that explains why Bradley cooper was a part of it and during the credits I noticed that he's the one who did the casting. So in the end , war dogs isn't kaboom ,kapoosh and bomb blasts ,its a solid entertainer with lots of laughter , relatable characters and an old school moral to not be greedy and just like will smith said "" don't lose focus "" you'll know what I mean ,once you finish watching the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Poor direction... overacting this is no ""Falcon and the Snowman""""","Based on actual fact, co-written, co-produced and directed by Todd Phillips directing somewhat of an altered version about 2 young men of David Packouz (Miles Teller) and Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill) illegal arms dealings with other countries. As the movie transitioned when David was having some hard times reuniting with childhood friend Efraim allowing him to manipulate him to be involve in this illegal arms deal scheme. One of the main problems I have is the casting of Jonah Hill who does way too much overacting, just watching him sometimes appear like loud mouth who is craving for attention, and that to me is not acting. Portraying one guy as the person who is just going along it does not appear to be an actual portrayal if one were to watch the actual doc it was based on or if i were to read the articles. Watch ""The Falcon And the Snowman"" starring Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn instead.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
War is an economy,"This film tells the story of a massage therapist who goes broke because his business venture of selling luxury bed sheets does not work out. He is recruited by his childhood friend to make big money by bidding on military contracts.""War Dogs"" touches on a mysterious aspect of the world that is not often talked about. Therefore, the story is already intriguing, and I want to find out what happens to the two guys. What they do might seem questionable to some, and their subsequent success gives much food for thought. The ending makes you think and reflect on the fine line between right and wrong; and how people can get caught up in their successes. Another good aspect is that despite the subject matter, the story manages to be funny yet remains dramatic enough to be taken seriously.It's not a masterpiece, but it does a respectable job showing the degrees to which these types go to enrich themselves.

Truth is stranger than fiction.,"A brash loud mouthed entrepeneurd Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill) recruits old friend David Packouz (Miles Teller) into his arms dealing business and base themselves in Miami. David is a massage therapist and wants to settle down to a family life with his wife (Ana de Armas), but Efraim seduces him down another path to make money to help him pay off his debts. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq prove to be very lucrative for them as they sort of legitmately buy arms off fallen regimes around the world to sell on to the US military. They believe they have a windfall when they are offered warehouses of arms and millions of shells in Albania.They say that truth is stranger than fiction and WAR DOGS is the very epitomy of this. The basis of the film is Guy Lawson's 'Rolling Stone' article about how two twenty-somethings with no military experience become big time arms dealers in war zones and in the film uses Teller's character as the narrator of his own unbelievable story. The scenes in Iraq are the funniest and equally the scariest situation to be in. Hill for once is wonderful in his excess and with his SCARFACE obsessed character is the driving force behind the energy of the film. At times though the film feels like director Todd Phillips can't decide whether to go down a more Scorsese/GOODFELLAS path or the comedy of his own HANGOVER films.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Albanian woman asking for her missing husband spoke in Romanian!!,"I liked this movie. Kept me entertained. It had a good story line, humour and great actors!
I took two stars though as I was disappointed to see that when one of the main characters was in Albania, there was a woman that spoke in Romanian AND as a Romanian, made me wonder if Romanian language is supposed to be considered the language that is spoken in Albania..??!!!
I hope that the explanation could also be that the missing Albanian man was just married to a Romanian.. as otherwise: in Albania, people speak Albanian and in Romania people speak Romanian. I know! I'm Romanian!

An entertaining couple of hours,"I went to see this on a whim knowing little about it. What I saw was a fast paced 'unbelievable' story that is apparently based on fact. The key actors all played their parts extremely well. Not a weak performance from anyone. The two leads Miles Teller and Jonah Hill make the film as you liked THEM (to begin with) but not what they were doing. The honesty of the narrative as our chief protagonist (David Packouz) slips further and further into moral turpitude is both refreshing and humorous. This once again indicates to me that there are no morals when it comes to big money (a Pentagon-inspired market akin to the Stock Exchange) and its' corruption so admirably defined in 'The Big Short', 'The Wolf of Wall Street' etc. Government waste laid bare. Corruption, dealing with 'enemies', the list goes on. Not only an entertaining couple of hours but also a depressing reminder of what makes the world go around.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Disappointing,"This movie has such a great start. But unfortunately when scenes in Albania started I couldn't stand but cringe at all the misrepresentations that made the rest of the movie hard to watch. The Albanian characters have a Russian or slavic accent. Albania itself is presented as this soviet, cold, gray country when in reality it's just not like that at all. All 50 + year old Albanians in this movie speak fluent English which is ridiculous. The hotel where David is kidnapped is right at the center of Tirana (Where btw he is kidnapped later on the film. This would be almost impossible at that particular big hotel in the center of the capital) but then he's shown jogging in a part of the city which is miles away from his hotel and its obvious that they selected that location to give Albania this rough eastern scary look. These are just a few things of the top of my head. There's countless others. Not to mention the orientalist tendencies shown during the scenes in Jordan and Iraq. If I wasn't Albanian I would have probably enjoyed this film more. Too bad I am.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
What a life. Want it.,"SYNOPSIS:
Based on a true story, David (Miles Teller), gets reunited with his old friend, Efraim (Jonah Hill), who reels him into the world of arms dealing. The rush of making big money causes David to take a big risk with Efraim that he's not comfortable with.REVIEW:
This is one of those films that I consider wildly underrated. Not because people don't give it the props that it deserves, but because when you bring up lists like ""Best of the Past Decade,"" people don't really bring up this film.There's something about a film that immediately comes off as intellectual, that really draws me in. I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks this way, but from the very opening scene I got that vibe from this film. The narration from Miles Tiller as he's just breaking down a gun that's in front of him and starts to bring you to the numbers (sorry math haters). It's shows a true direction of the writing and right off the bat tells the viewer, ""hey, you better keep up."" I'm not saying that you'll be confused, but the pace of the film is asking the viewer to keep your eyes on. If you start slow or too much ""action"", let's say, either way those two directions can lose someone's interest right away or be too much for someone to take in right away. With War Dogs, there's a little bit of suspense and a little bit of story telling that doesn't hold you for too long to where you're starting to not care. The acting you get from both Teller and Hill is stellar, but the clear standout is Jonah Hill. A large portion of the film almost comes off like it's directed by Efraim. It has this egotistical style with analytics, fast tempo, and look-at-how-I-turned-this-poor-masseuse-into-a-big-baller style. And just like the Efraim character in the film, when the direction feels that way, it's far more interesting. You get caught up like how David gets caught up.If you're looking for a solid film from beginning to end that will literally keep you interested in what's going to happen next all the way through, this is a great film for you. Superb acting, beautifully paced, and impressively funny/suspensful. 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Entertaining fun for fans of Wolf of Wall Street or Catch Me If You Can,"That laugh... Even better than Jonah Hill's teeth in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"".I really enjoyed this film. It was well-paced, had some laughs, good use of tension and action, with Hill and Teller having a good dynamic too.Pretty crazy that it was a true story - the US seems to have (or at least had) an insane system. Would be nice if one of these rags to riches story actually had a happy ending, but I guess that's life.Ana de Armas is in this movie too. Who? Yeah, I didn't know who she was prior to watching this, but now I want to book a ticket to Cuba, a destination not even in the movie. Stunningly attractive with excellent acting chops too.If you like ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" or ""Catch Me If You Can"" then you'll probably enjoy this. ""War Dogs"" is an easy-to-watch film that kept me entertained throughout!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Guns guns guns,"War Dogs After movies such as ""The Hangover"", ""Due Date"" and ""Project X"", Todd Phillips is back with another home run movie. He writes, produces and directs ""War Dogs"" a film based on the true story of two men's quest for riches through government-contracted gunrunning.Jonah Hill plays Efraim the greedy self-absorbed gun dealer who pulls an old friend into the business. Jonah delivers Efraim as a character who the audience can both love and hate. With a crying laugh and swaggering I'm-better-than-you walk, Jonah believably changes into Efraim and leads you from one emotion to the next. Miles Teller who creates David, an equally memorable character, plays Efraim's friend. Teller shapes David into a frustrated man who's looking for a way out of massaging Miami's rich business class. Teller paints the character as an ordinary man of quiet desperation. David's shortcomings are made relocatable by his frustration. He's the kind of guy who's looking to do the right thing but is trying to succeed in a dangerous business at the same time. Teller's laid back, morally driven character succeeds at seeming so baseline by maintaining a surface calm throughout the film. His appeal comes from the way Teller portrays Packouz's relationship with his pregnant girlfriend. Everything he does is to take care of, and protect her even if it is by lying to her. Towards the end of the film, Teller's portrayal of the anger of being betrayed by a friend seemed so genuine you too hate Efraim right along with him. Allowing the audience to connect better with him, than his coke-snorting counterpart. The script seems typical of most of Todd Phillips movies. Cultural slang was pervasive in some of the characters. Both Jonah and Miles said ""Bro"" enough times to truly make me believe they did not even know each other's names. Teller's script with his girlfriend endears the couple to the viewer. You can easily tell at he beginning of the movie that they are at peace with each other. As the movie's tension builds so too does the tension between these two characters. There are a few scenes where Teller's girlfriend accuses him of lying to her and his reply is along the lines of, ""I did it for you."" On the other hand Efraim's character was also built upon through the language he used, with racial slurs and cursing Jonah was able to paint the picture of an ignorant American out of place in a business, country and day in age. The way the movie put events together was also quite interesting. With a series of blackout text frames, Todd Phillips was able to cover a larger time frame than a single running story line would have allowed. The text frames also gave hints as to what would happen in the up coming segment. It helped build excitement and in some cases dread for the characters as it became evident that the text in the fame would eventually turn into dialogue before the next section would begin. Although this did break the cohesion of the piece as a whole, it added an interesting aspect I do not see very often in films. The movie starts with David in a fog encrusted warehouse district with a gun pointed at his face before going back to the beginning of the story. This skipping around in the time frame of the film made me think of Quinton Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"". Although I would not say War Dogs will have the cult following that Tarantino's film does, by starting the movie where he does, Todd Phillips created a more compelling beginning for the movie.""War Dogs"" takes a unique look at the way the United States government handled dealing with undesirables to work the war machine during the Iraq war. With a compelling story, excellent actors, and social commentary extending beyond just the war to a social commentary on the American dream. This story about the desire to accumulate wealth is well worth the nearly two hour run time. I recommend you check this movie out!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Good work Todd Phillips!,"This movie is the final first time watch of a Todd Phillips movie for me and it was very good.Positives for War Dogs (2016):
It was so good to see Todd Phillips get back in the game after the horrible Hangover Trilogy. Miles Teller and Jonah Hill are both very good as the two protagonists of this movie. I also appreciated that this movie serves as a kind of a test project for Todd Phillips before he would write and direct Joker (2019). There is still some comedy in this movie, but it's more on the darker side of comedy and I liked a lot of the dark humor. And finally, I've gotta give credit to Todd Phillips for taking a real life story and giving it a Little bit entertainment value to it, you know something that Michael Bay failed to do with Pain & Gain (2013).Negatives for War Dogs (2016):
The movie is way too long and I definitely felt that runtime as it was dragging in spots.Overall, War Dogs (2016) is a great comeback movie for writer-director Todd Phillips and I can't wait to rewatch Joker (2019).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Humor, intelligence, and experience all put into one role.. He drives this movie and gives every viewer something different to think. Apart from the usual 21 and 22 jump street we are all used to seeing him in, which are good films by the way! We see him play a much more serious role in this film! and he smashed it! Cant top Wolf of Wall street of course. As for Miles Teller he also did very well in his role, i don't know a lot about the bloke but i know he played a part in the latest Fantastic Four which was a shambles!

"Dolla, Dolla, Bill Y'all","Another home run for each of these actors and the director. The movie's plot is about two childhood friends who happen to come across each other at a funeral. Little did David Packouz (Teller), a shy penny-earning massage therapist, know that this reunion with his ""old school bro"" would take to an extreme turnaround in his life. Efraim Divoreli (Hill) is presented to us as the fun, unconcerned, know-it-all and living the ""life"" type of guy. Though roles do seem to flip as the flick goes on. We get a taste of how our ambition and desire of always wanting more and more can sometimes strike back. These two young men, after just hitting a few bowls and some small business affairs in Efraim's office, turn into the up-and-coming hotshots in the Arms Trade. Eventually expanding their business, AEY, and becoming a ""big deal"" but run into problems as greed starts to kick in, testing how far they are really willing to go so that they can get their hands on that long-desired prize. It's not all fun and games when your in the big leagues. The film is funny, dramatic and has a Wolf of Wall Street vibe to it. The acting by these two gentlemen, especially Hill is superb.

Get the facts right,I saw the move and I can't give more than 3/10. The story is somehow right. If you gonna show a movie played in Albania at least go into that country and film some parts there. The hotel where the guys stayed was Sheraton and not some crappy motel. And yes Alabama has a lot of guns and ammunition but those are not stored on churches and schools and hospitals. And that is not true. They do have lots of tunnels where ammunition is stored. I am surprised this movie didn't talk what happen to the Albanian contractor. And how he died. Or the big explosion that happen to that factory. And Tirana is way better than they showed in this movie. I never seen those kind of buildings in Tirana or the big church that they showed. And when he goes running those run down buildings are not in Albania. And even that magazine is not in Albanian. And maybe the movie should have talked about the 26 ppl that died and 300 injured in the explosion that happen to that factory. It wasn't worth watching it,,Anonymous,Biography
