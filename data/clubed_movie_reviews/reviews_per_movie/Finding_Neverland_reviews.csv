The Mystery Of It All,"Johnny Depp takes us by the hand and in the gentlest most reassuring way leads into the heart, soul and mind of an artist. How easy is for the world to judge. How frightened we still are of all we don't understand. The very nature of innocence is suspect because innocence belongs exclusively to the innocent. Every time the world claims to protect it, tends to destroy it. ""Finding Nerverland"" is filled with moments of enlightenment. Moving and powerful moments but none more so than Julie Christie's face as she applauds, converted to the fantasy transported into her daughter's house. The moment and the enlightenment are short lived, but, somehow, remains in my mind as a glimmer of hope. If for a moment she accepts the mystery of it all, maybe we all could. Johnny Depp is the best American actor of his generation, period. Kate Winslet is a stunning rarity among her contemporaries. She doesn't look like anybody else and the camera catches every tiny little thought that crosses her marvelous face. Congratulations Mr. Forster you can count on me from this moment on as a devoted fan.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Now that we're past the hype... don't miss this movie!,"Every holiday season Harvey Weinstein and Miramax talk up one of their properties, fully expecting everyone to bow and throw awards at it as soon as it's released. This year it's Finding Neverland, which has produced a lot of buzz in favor of Johnny Depp's sophisticated performance. Although the film deserves all the praise it gets, it is understandable that moviegoers are a little weary with another dramatic period piece, with another ""oscar caliber"" cast, about yet another take on Peter Pan.The bottom line is, this movie is phenomenal. Exploring the major theme of Barrie's play (that of a boy who never grows up), Finding Neverland refrains from condemning grown-ups, but exalts the wild magic one can enjoy as a kid. For James, who had to deal with his family's reticence upon the death of his brother, the real tragedy occurs when a child is forced to grow up too fast.My favorite idea from this film is this: life finds a way to put into our lives the people we're supposed to be living our lives with. James and Sylvia needed each other, and they needed each other at that particular time. Life took care of them.The film does indeed move at a snail's pace. Consider that part of the set design. Just as the characters go about 1905 London in top hats and buttoned-down gowns, so does the movie develop in a manner which would have been fitting for a time which preceded MTV-generation attention spans by about a hundred years.As for the acting, it is wonderful. Depp is understated and gallant, Kate Winslet is lovely and tragic, and they're both better than I've ever seen them. Julie Christie is brutally ominous as the matriarch who can gum up everyone's happiness. Dustin Hoffman, although out of place, brings a dry wit as a risk-taking businessman. The boys playing the Davis kids are a lot of fun to watch and play their dramatic parts perfectly.If you want something where all the pieces of the magic puzzle that is movie-making come together with grace, charm, and humanity, you won't find a more rewarding film than this.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Superb Acting and Brilliantly Made,"Finding Neverland is one of the best films I have seen all year. Depp and Winslet are superb and their supporting cast is very strong in particular Julie Christie, Dustin Hoffman and Freddie Highmore. Forster's direction is tight and he maintains a story which had the potential to drag. Depp delivers a performance that is truly believable and he interacts with his co-stars well, in particular, Freddie Highmore who delivers a performance that outshines Depp's. It is a tour de force of acting talent. Clearly Highmore has a great career ahead of him. 9/10 for a superb piece of film-making, made diligently but, unfortunately, up against such strong contention, it had to make do with a disappointing award haul.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of Depp's finest films!,"I am not a film critic by any means, and don't aim to pose as one. That being said, I felt that this movie was by far one of the most touching and entertaining movies I have seen in my short 22 years. The cast is fabulous, every actor plays his/her part so to speak.The story centers around J. M. Barrie, creator of Peter Pan, and his journey to writing the well-known play. It highlights his genius, while also showing the painful isolation that comes with being a mind ahead of your time. There are some liberties taken when put against the actual events that led up to the birth of Peter Pan, but don't let this dissuade you from watching--""Finding Neverland"" was never slated as being a documentary!Being a huge Johnny Depp fan, one would think that my judgment would be tainted by his involvement in the film. However, even I can admit to a failed Depp movie (i.e. The Secret Window). At first, I thought that putting Depp outside of his usual character type, a mildly strange pirate/writer/doctor/investigator/man with scissors for hands, might signify a substandard film. Boy was I wrong! He nailed J.M. Barrie and was absolutely captivating throughout the entire film. I hate to sound like a starry-eyed fan but I thought his performance in this movie was downright Oscar-worthy!Depp is magnificent, but he does not carry the weight of this film on his own. A slue of other fine actors and actresses, Kate Winslet and Freddy Highmore just to name a few, give absolutely divine performances. Do yourself a favor, shell out the eight bucks and go see this movie!",,Anonymous,Biography
Depply Beautiful,"I don't know how good this movie is and I don't care because I loved it. It left me kind of numb. Moved, transported, enchanted. That's exactly how I want to feel when I get out of a movie. ""Finding Neverland"" gave it to me, in spades. Johnny Depp, hey Johnny you're the best we've got. I forgot that it was you two minutes into the movie, I only knew I loved that character. That in itself is part of the many miracles the movie has in store. Yours, is a performance of perfect beauty. Kate Winslet is quickly becoming my favourite actress. Julie Christie is, was and always will be my ""Darling"" but Freddie Highmore, you and your brothers gave me one the best evenings in a movie theatre I had in a long, long, time. My girlfriend just read my comment over my shoulder, her comment was very succinct: ""You write like a woman"" Okay, let's see if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Good night kids.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Magical and very affecting,"Of course it takes liberties with the truth, not the first biographical drama to do that, but I cannot deny that Finding Neverland was very magical and affecting and was beautifully crafted not only in visuals but in acting too. Plus it made me believe in Peter Pan again, and that is a wonderful feeling as Peter Pan is one of my all-time favourite stories. The cinematography, costumes, locations and scenery are absolutely stunning, and the score gives the film its magical feeling. The script had its deft touches, the story had a perfect balance of the humorous and the tragic, and director Marc Forster deserves credit for making even those mundane events into something somewhat enchanting. The acting is wonderful too- Johnny Depp is nothing short of magnificent as JM Barrie as he alternates between being playful and sensitive, it was his sensitive side especially that made his performance so good. Kate Winslet is very tender as Sylvia and Dustin Hoffmann impresses in a smaller role. Even the kids were good, especially Freddie Highmore who offers a wonderful portrayal as the serious-minded Peter. In conclusion, beautiful film, very affecting when it needed to be and quite magical to say the least. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Wings of Imagination,"The real J.M. Barrie was influenced and inspired as a child in Scotland by the adventurous stories of Robert Louis Stevenson of pirates, Indians and kidnapped boys. As a young journalist in London in the peak years of the Gilded Age his vivid imagination took him from novels to stage-plays.Barrie loved games and founded a cricket club with fellow writers Arthur Conan Doyle and P.G. Wodehouse. An old nugget describing his personality tells of his comments upon himself and others that often appeared in the newspapers. He once remarked to H.G. Wells, ""It is all very well to be able to write books, but can you wiggle your ears?"" It was in the very early years of the 20th Century, now 101 years ago and the same year that in the windy Outer Banks of North Carolina that the Wright Brothers took flight that Jamie Barrie's Peter Pan soared into the air on wires in the London stage.Marc Forester's fascinating film biography adapted by David Magee from Allan Knee's play, ""The Man Who Was Peter Pan,"" now comes to us in this delightful, moving account, 'Finding Neverland.' It presents historical reality between lushly imagined expeditions to a fictitious Neverland. It's performed impeccably by Johnny Depp as Sir James Mathew Barrie and an extraordinary cast under the able direction of Marc Forster.This is the loveliest film of the year, highly recommended. Bring Kleenex for the final scenes and see how difficult it is to leave the theater and return to today.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Wow,"I always tell my students that they can't claim a movie they just saw as their favorite movie ever because it has yet to stand the test of time. Every now and then a movie comes along that defies that rule for me -- a movie that as soon as I finish seeing it I know that it is an instant classic, if not ""my favorite movie ever."" American Beauty was such a movie.Finding Neverland is such a movie. Every minute of this movie was simply incredible -- I felt like the kids in the theater on the opening night of Peter Pan. Johnny Depp is absolutely astounding, as he usually is, as JM Barrie. The rest of the adult cast doesn't quite come up to his level, but are uniformly strong. The kids, especially Peter and Michael, are wonderful. Maybe I just love the British accent, but one of my favorite scenes comes very early when Barrie meets Michael in the park -- Michael's accent reminded me so much of the kid in The Little Prince!What raises this movie above standard fare, though, are the clever entries into Barrie's imagination. The magical moments in this movie seem to literally jump off the screen. Without a doubt, a film worthy of Oscar nominations for Depp, screenplay adaptation, cinematography (the pirate ship scene is gorgeous), and best movie of the year. Treat yourself - despite the PG rating, this is NOT a movie just for kids -- believe... 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
the gentle Scotsman,"Powerful acting from an impressive array of names makes Finding Neverland a deeply moving film. The play Peter Pan is the shining light Barrie crafted to clear the shadows that clutter everyday life. The film, like the play, has a magical, translucent quality. Depp inhabits Barrie fully. The accent wobbles now and again with patches of Leith and Brigadoon breaking through, but Barrie's quest to show the child in us is the best of us is lovingly depicted in Depp's characterisation. Winslet, once again, rises to a challenging role. With outings like this and her stint in Little Children and Jude, she is inheriting the mantle of Streep as actress with the most range. We don't see enough of Julie Christie these days, but her rare gifts are all the more appreciated when so potently displayed. A great actress doing justice to fine writing - every word she utters is like cut glass. Hoffman cruises but does not disappoint in a role that seems to have been written for Jim Broadbent. And all credit to young Freddie Highmore - in such distinguished acting company, he elicits and earns our tears the most.An air of sadness orbits Barrie, his child-like behaviour a counter-point to it. His writing, his take on life, are triumphs of the human spirit. Elegiac, life-affirming, and timeless, the movie embodies the life and work it chronicles.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful Johnny Depp,"It's London 1903, J.M. Barrie's (Johnny Depp) latest play is a flop. On an idyllic day in the park, he befriends widower Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four boys. The youngest being Peter (Freddie Highmore). Sylvia's mother Mrs. Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie) disapproves of her independence, and truly disapproves of her friendship with Barrie. JM's wife Mary (Radha Mitchell) isn't much happier. She'd hope to social climb upon Mrs. du Maurier's standings but in the end, she can't take being left out.This is a wonderfully sweet movie. Sure a lot of it has been changed from the real history. That really doesn't matter in the least bit. I love the dog. I love the beds. I love all that stuff. It's great to see Johnny Depp in a more reserved role. He is more than wacky characters, and has wonderful chemistry with the kids. It's a gentle family movie for everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Okay, I'll admit it  I got sucked in","Never having been a fan of ""Peter Pan"" and therefore ambivalent to J.M. Barrie himself, I wasn't in a big hurry to see ""Finding Neverland"" despite the many accolades it received. However, since it showed up on the IMDb Top 250 list and as a Best Picture nominee I figured I'd better check it out.To my surprise, I found the film to be extremely beautiful and charming. ""Finding Neverland"" chronicles the creation of Barrie's play ""Peter Pan"" and its profound effect on the lives of the people in Barrie's life as well as theatergoers in England. Barrie, (Depp) a mediocre playwright who is not able to reach his audience and is therefore beginning to bankrupt his faithful producer Charles Frohman (Hoffman), is writing one day in the park when he happens upon the Llewelyn Davies family. Sylvia (Winslet), the mother (and a young widow) is trying to corral her four young boys and when they run into Barrie they immediately become friends. Barrie begins to spend increasingly more time with the family, much to the chagrin of his wife Mary and Sylvia's mother Emma (Christie). It becomes clear that the Barries' marriage has been slowly falling apart for some time now, but because of their time apart and his obvious adoration of the Llewelyn Davies family, the deterioration becomes more rapid. Emma, on the other hand, is the typical overbearing mother who disapproves of Barrie, mainly because he is ruining Sylvia's chances of ""landing"" another man. When a crisis strikes the Llewelyn Davies family, Barrie grows closer to Peter, the second youngest son, who is still grieving the loss of his own father, and the loss of his imagination; something that Barrie tries to help him through.The only other Marc Forster film I had seen prior to ""Finding Neverland"" was ""Monsters Ball"", a film that I really didn't like, but more for its actors and story than for the production of the film. I was therefore intrigued by what his treatment of this film, a completely different subject matter, would be. I found this film completely and utterly aesthetically beautiful. Even before the ""Peter Pan"" and Neverland scenes, I was struck by the gorgeous Victorian sets and costumes, and the interesting way that Barrie's imagination was expressed. (Opening up his bedroom door and seemingly walking into a green meadow is just one of the many examples) The Neverland scenes were simply stunning, so much so that they were profoundly emotional. I particularly loved a scene when ""Peter Pan"" was premiering, and orphans that had been invited by Barrie to watch the performance experienced it for the first time  I can't stand children, but the looks on their faces and the reactions of the aristocratic members of the audience to the children was so very touching. There were things about the film that I did not care for regarding the film of course; without giving a lot away, I thought that there were a few moments of easy resolution (particularly involving Barrie and his wife) and I think that the relationship that Barrie had with Sylvia was a bit TOO subtle, because when he discloses his feelings for her I remember thinking, ""Oh. Really?"" Obviously there was great affection, but not to the extent that was realized. I also noticed that the alleged pedophilia was obviously not addressed; something that I expected but was hoping wouldn't be glossed over.I've come to expect top-notch performances by Johnny Depp at this point, and he absolutely did not disappoint in his portrayal of Barrie. He was utterly charming, and without the use of makeup or Tim Burton, really became somebody else that was not recognizable as ""Johnny Depp playing (fill in the blank)"". I'm not a huge fan of Winslet, though I do recognize her acting ability, and I thought she was very good in this film. Certain actresses do period pieces well, and she is definitely one of them. She was entirely believable as the mother of the boys and exuded warmth and protectiveness, yet showed that she is still young and can horse around with her sons and Barrie because she enjoys it.I was kind of expecting that I would feel this film took the place of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" as a Best Picture nominee, but after experiencing the film I feel it is very deserving of its nomination. Those who know me will probably be shocked that I enjoyed this film so much because I normally have no interest in cute sentimentality (and furthermore, children) in film, but because Forster created such a beautiful film, I have to give it a solid 7/10.--Shelly",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Barrie Reassembled.,"When watching this movie, with it's deterministic cause and effect, wall-to-wall clichés and hackneyed sentiment, can anyone be so naive as to think that this is actually how Barrie's life played out? You watch it in a posture of disagreement. Hollywood biopics aren't based on the individual lives anymore, they're just rewrites of previously successful biopics. If Hollywood made a movie about your life it would be filled with such perfect synchronization that you'd barely recognize your own story. Any personal complexity would be obliterated by some all-explaining, simplistic backstory. Your story would resemble ""Rocky"" because it's the only life-arc Hollywood knows how to produce anymore. We couldn't leave the audience pondering anything left open-ended as they exit. This movie doesn't trust an audience to figure things out without being led to them. I perceived the captain hook/mother reference eons before the movie literalized it for me. I could see the 25 kids twist coming for days.This is a completely average movie. Not horrible but not great. Hence it's likely to be showered with a few Oscars next year. There's nothing the Academy likes better than congratulating itself for finally noticing patterns put in place over the previous thirty years.From the New Yorker article ""Lost Boys"" by ANTHONY LANE:""Arthur Llewelyn Davies, also adored his boys, and it may be unfair of ""Finding Neverland"" to omit him, for streamlining purposes, from the scene; by the time that Johnny Depp meets Kate Winslet, she is already a widow, whereas Arthur was very much alive when Barrie first entered the consciousnessand, little by little, the homeof the Llewellyn Davies family.""Finding Neverland"" is a weepie. From the moment that Barrie met George and Jack, and started to ponder the means by which they might be rendered immortal, the story is sad, but the reality is even more dismal: 1907Arthur Llewellyn Davies dies from cancer of the jaw. 1910Sylvia dies of lung cancer. The five boys are orphaned; Barrie is made their guardian. 1915George is killed in the First World War, fighting with his regiment in Flanders. 1921Michael, an undergraduate at Oxford, is drowned while swimming with a friend. The two bodies, when recovered, are found clinging together.On April 5, 1960, Peter Llewellyn Davies, by then an esteemed publisher, threw himself under a subway train in London. We should not presume to read a mind in torment, but we may note in passing that, if he had lived another month, he would have reached the centenary of Barrie's birth and thus, one imagines, a fresh flurry of interest in ""Peter Pan""""that terrible masterpiece,"" in the words of Peter Llewellyn Davies.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"10 Stars! If you see no other movie this year, see this one!,","FINDING NEVERLAND is that rare work of art that transcends the medium of film and becomes a spirit-altering experience. Strong accolades? Gush? Perhaps so, but squeeze time out of the clutter of life and the holidays to see this movie and be transported to a place that nurturingly reassures us that the cycle of life is indeed good. Find Neverland!Marc Forster ('Monster Ball') has created a lovingly tender look at the playwright JM Barrie (Johnny Depp) in 1903 when, down on his luck with theater flops, unfulfilled by a marriage of Victorian standards to a beautiful but aloof and social climbing wife Mary (Radha Mitchell), and with writer's block, he encounters the Llewellyn Davies family - a widow Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her four boys, George (Nick Roud), Jack (Joe Prospero), Michael (Luke Spill) and Peter (Freddie Highmore) - playing blissfully in Kensington Gardens. Barrie is captivated, draws the boys to him with his patient and infectious enthusiasm for play, and bonds with this family, gaining the obvious seeds for his highest achievement or creation, PETER PAN.How these seeds grow, despite the soft, yet supportive, growling of his producer Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman) and the not so soft interference of Sylvia's wealthy haughty mother Madame du Maurier (Julie Christie), form the storyline of this film. The magic comes from the skill of the writers (Alan Knee and David Magee) and director, the cinematographer (never has Victorian London glowed with such elegant gaslight presence), and the musical score by Jan Kaczmarek. Cameo roles are treated with tremendous respect: Eileen Essel as Mrs. Snow, Ian Hart as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Kelly MacDonald as the first Peter Pan, etc all are brief but fully realized and poignant. Given this support it is obvious that the talents of the lead performers will shine, and they glow they do with such understated performances that make the simple story of the sanctity of the inner child so cogent that there is not a dry eye in the house during the thankfully long credits. Johnny Depp continues to prove that he is one of the finest actors on the screen today: his Barrie has a flawless Scottish accent and a manner of movement and facial expressions that make him a gentle hero. Kate Winslet, never more beautiful, likewise embodies Sylvia with exactly the right amount of perk and pathos, and as her mother, Julie Christie is strikingly beautiful and unfailingly solid in a role less than loving. The boys are artfully recreated, never absurdly over the top, always very close to the bridge that crosses the craggy canyon between childhood and adulthood. Growing up has never been better portrayed - by all of the characters!In a time when too often films that address magic and imagination rely on computer effects to create creatures that are comic book absurd, FINDING NEVERLAND relies on simply showing the stage mechanics of the play, suspending wires and all, even in the climax of the story when Barrie brings his successful play to the living room of the ill Sylvia in order to keep his promise to her to take her to Neverland. No gimmicks here, just solid stagecraft very much in keeping with the inherent magic of Barrie's enduring play. This is a brilliant cinematic accomplishment - a feast for the eyes, the ears, the brain, and the soul. Please don't miss it! Grady Harp, November 2004",,Anonymous,Biography
FINALLY! Sentiment you  can swallow!,"I don't cry at movies. No eyes welling up . . as a rule. Okay, I cried during Henry V (the Kenneth Branagh version) when the French army slaughtered all the pages in the English camp. I don't even tend to care for movies that might make me cry. I spend my hard earned big screen cash on movies with big effects or epic vistas ( think The Matrix or The Lords Of the Ring) Finding Neverland was a glorious exception.Beautifully acted, sweet but not syrupy and perfect for a break from all the holiday madness, Finding Neverland was a true gem. I don't believe its for as young of a crowd as I watched it with ( the 4 year old beside me was constantly needing plot clarification from her mother) but both my 47 year old husband & my 32 year old self were enchanted! In this jaded day & age it was a relief to see a movie that had romance without overt sexuality, a PLOT , and true emotion without sentimentality. And where did they find these child actors? Luke Spill, Joe Prospero, Nick Roud and especially Freddie Highmore were excellent. Rarely have I seen children perform on screen so realistically and charmingly. I'm sure they'll all have brilliant futures if they chose to stay in the business.I would say something here about Johnny Depp but what is there to say? Besides, I'm biased- I've never seen a Johnny Depp movie I didn't like, & I'm sure I've seen every one! Julie Christie was a powerhouse playing a difficult character in the most likable way.Don't let this movie slip under your radar!

"Not mend to reach for boundaries, but as good as it is","First of all I want to say that Winslet an Depp are 2 of the best actors of their generation.I find Finding Neverland a touching story. Depp convinces as Barry (nice accent) and all other actors are well known and show their best. Nothing wrong with the acting. The story is emotional, but not too emotional or too smooth. The magical elements that come in when Barry takes the children into his imaginary world is beautiful and well balanced. Nothing wrong with that.And that is maybe also a little criticism about the film. It doesn't bother itself with deeper things, like rumours about Barry's pedophilia, however mentioned briefly. There could have been a nice opportunity to make this film more special. But this movie wasn't mend to reach for boundaries. And why should it? As a beautiful and well acted drama this film is as good as it is. Let us just stay with that. Fine by me.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Beautiful, Moving Movie with Very Few Flaws","I had heard that this was merely a ""chick flick."" Hey, my wife is the one who wanted to go see it. As it turned out, I went with three other guys, and we all loved it.Some movies entertain; some teach; some open up new worlds. This movie opened up new worlds. With each passing scene, carefully woven from the previous ones, it was like crossing yet another threshold into another world. The story unfolded deeper and deeper with each new scene, each layer adding not to complexity (the story is rather simple), but to the depth. Depp and the others (esp. the young actor who played Peter) easily lead the audience deeper and deeper into the paths of authenticity, healing, love, friendship and the triumph of inner strength. The other characters, likewise, garnish the central story excellently.The only flaw I saw is, I'm sure, a matter of taste and perspective; I felt the grandmother was simply too two-dimensional and not as believable as she should have been, though she, too, had some beautiful moments that truly added to the film.Having much experience with divorce (being a divorce attorney) I found the unfortunate relationship between Depp's character and his wife believable to a tee: two people deeply in love with each other yet more committed to personal pursuits than tending the difficult relationship we call marriage. Ironically, though Depp's character ultimately became the main caretaker of the four boys, by following the tender feelings of his heart, he allowed his marriage to evaporate by not following the other tender feelings of his heart.Nearly perfect. I give it a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Bit Dull, But Picks Up As It Goes","The story of Sir James M. Barrie's friendship with a family who inspired him to create Peter Pan.I have a few quibbles with this film. First being it is not strictly accurate. I feel like the film tried to balance history with fun, but history got the short end of the stick too often. Barrie deserves a good biopic, and this just is not it. I am particularly referring to the absence of Arthur Davies -- his being gone makes Barrie seem even more scandalous than he probably was.I also thought it was rather dull at first, though the second half was much improved. History does not have to be dull -- both ""King's Speech"" and ""Iron Lady"" are excellent films that present history. This film seemed almost devoid of history... when was it set? How did that impact the characters? It is not clear.But I do not mean to be so harsh, as it actually was a rather good story. Seeing Julie Christie is a plus, and Dustin Hoffman never fails (his role is much too small). Kate Winslet did a more than adequate job, and Johnny Depp was... well, decent. (I find it hard to judge Depp because he has reached that level of stardom where it is easily to see him than it is to see the character he portrays).",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Disappointed.,"Today I viewed the premiere of Finding Neverland and found it most disappointing.Entertaining?Yes...but very factually incorrect. Johnny Depp was pleasant, but too young,too attractive and too tall....with no sign of the pipe.Barrie didn't meet a young widow, but,after meeting her, and also her boys in the Gardens,became very friendly with Sylvia and Arthur Llewellyn Davies.This friendship lasted for the 10 years until Arthur finally succumbed to his facial cancer, and on his deathbed, Lleyellyn Davies made Barrie promise to look after his boys and wife for the rest of their days. The film showed J.M. and the family sharing his country cottage, but did not show the fact that the whole family took a nearby house for the season and lived separately.In the movie, Sylvia basically said she was in love with Barrie and they both admitted they expected it to go on forever. It has been suggested that Barrie tampered with her will to get control of the boys.Factually, both Arthur and Sylvia trusted Barrie with their boys, and rightly so, and wanted him to oversee their futures. Any suggestion of impure thoughts towards them are disgusting.When his wife left him and they eventually divorced, he was distraught....and lost.The film does rightly show Barrie's sense of fun and tremendous imagination, but it should be remembered, and shown,that he had deep sense of empathy with many characters and ""Peter Pan"" was the only play of his to survive the years to be completely written for the ""young at heart"".",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Deceptively-Good Movie, Better Than What First Meets The Eye","I found this to be just as nice a movie as it was advertised. I've seen it twice as of this review and liked it immensely more the second time. It helped that I now knew Freddie Highmore from his subsequent starring role in ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"" and it helped to watch this on my best TV which highlighted the magnificent cinematography in here.This is simply a beautifully-filmed movie, stunning in parts, and a touching story that gets you involved and makes you think. It's nice to see Johnny Depp step out of character and play a clean-cut, wholesome-looking guy instead of some wacky weirdo. He did a great job of it, too, coming across as a very likable character: J.M. Barrie, the author of ""Peter Pan.""The story offers an interesting dilemma: was Barrie an innocent friend helping out a family desperately in need a father figure, or was he ""out of bounds"" spending too much time with another family while he had a wife sitting home alone? The answer is the latter, even though the movie slants in favor of the former. Despite Barrie's good intentions, his first commitment was still with his wife. However, he was so good with those four kids in this film that it's hard to totally find fault with him.Hightower is the youngest of four kids left without a dad. The older brothers are good kids and all of them are good actors. You rarely hear their real names, so here they are: Joe Prospero, Nick Road and Luke Spill.Kate Winslet plays the mother and she, too, is excellent in this film. Radha Mitchell plays Barrie's wife and handles a tough situation in an interesting manner. Also in smaller-but-important roles are two big-name actors: Dustin Hoffman and Julie Christie.I really can't find much fault with this movie except that the first 30 minutes might be a little slow. If you know that in advance and stick with it, it's a wonderful and rewarding movie experience. Except for a quick one-second outburst in the beginning, there is absolutely no offensive language and anyone of any age should be able to watch and enjoy this. Overall, it's an interesting story of how the man who wrote ""Peter Pan"" came to do so.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Beautiful movie, brilliant acting. Simply Magical!","I'm a 16-year-old teenage girl and I suppose most other girls (or guys for that matter) won't enjoy this movie as much as I did. My two friends that I came with proved that, since they kept sighing and saying 'Oh my God...' throughout the entire movie. However, this is one of the most wonderful movies I've ever seen.It's a movie with a heart that just makes you smile. Not because it's a funny movie, but it's just a very sweet and magical movie. You feel like you're in James Barrie's mind and that's very interesting, since everything is in one way or another fairytale-like to him. James truly was Peter Pan and this movie showed that over and over again. He was still a little boy and it's wonderful to see how he expressed that. His relationship with the Davies family was so extraordinary to see and I loved every single second of it.Let's not forget the brilliant acting. I didn't expect otherwise from Johnny Depp, since he's my favorite actor of all times and he convinced me once again that he deserves to be called 'the best actor of all times' by me. Kate Winslet pleasantly surprised me. I always thought she was a great actress, but I never really enjoyed any of her movies. Now I had the chance to see what a great actress she is and I loved how she played her character and her commitment to her family. The children are all played by very talented kids and especially little Michael made me laugh, although I believe all three of them have something special. Like the boy that played little Peter. He was amazing.I think every adult (and probably some teenagers too) will enjoy this movie and it might remind them of the little child inside of them. I give this move 9 out of 10 stars. I loved every single second!",,Anonymous,Biography
Johnny Depp shines yet again.,"A magical journey which the young and the young-a-heart will be captivated, through smooth flow of storyline and a surprisingly good cast of the young actors involved. Depp, too, is superb with subtle yet arresting fine acting. Movie definitely not meant for those who are used to explicit violent, bomb or sex scenes....This film is i should say a ""feel-good"" movie, which implores you to use your imagination so as to enjoy what you have in existence. However, supporting characters like Kate Winslet and her mother are somewhat one-dimensional..More development about their characters would have been better understood. Overall a wonderful film with great cinematography, time not wasted at all!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Finding Yourself,"I am not one to warm up to movies centered around themes such as this film. This is not because the idea of adults finding their inner child is ridiculous or immature to me. Its a result of films facing that theme also face a very big challenge on managing to correctly portray a transformation of an adult by children. Also if it actually extremely benefits the adult character in many profound ways. Most of the times films never succeed at this and are done so irresponsibly promoting dangerous styles of living that could be just as hurtful to others around us. Now the major question that is posed then, is why does this film succeed where others do not? What makes this film so precise yet so open?With Johnny Depp as the lead character, James Matthew Barrie, you know he will be ideal for the role of someone inspired by creativity considering the unique feeling Depp can bring to any film. At the outset of the Finding Neverland, Depp's character is in dire straits to not only find himself as a writer but flat out just find himself. Eventually he does succeed at both through the help of three children he befriends whose mother, played by Kate Winslet, is ill. Depp discovers what he had long been missing, imagination and open mindedness. The children bring him that which is throughout is so wonderfully conveyed. His new lifestyle in no way endangers the people around him rather it enables his decisions to be more enlightened and thought out. Yet it still brings him into question. The cast is filled with talent ranging from of course Depp and Winslet as well to Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman. What the cast does not just play their characters, their characters are embodied by them all the way down to the performances of the kids.Marc Foster takes on this challenge of an adult searching for himself with complete success. The writing and dialog is always engaging as well as the music and all the other technical aspects that go into making a movie. Still, remains the question what sets this film apart from others that attempted to be like it? Unlike other films this film is centered around youth equaling imagination and creativity. Not always is it a must to abide by the rules, maybe not the rule of law but the unwritten rules of being an adult, being a writer or any other sort of unwritten or written rule relating to anything. Nonetheless this must be done at a responsible and safe level which this film never fails to display. These rules can limit our creativity which limits the capabilities of our mind and ultimately drastically decreases the chances at happiness on any pure or genuine level.Too often is youth simply associated with fun, stupidity and meaningless entertainment. It never falls into that trap. What this film shows is that we make meaning of our lives and this should start from our youth but not dissolve as our lives become further complex and self contradictory. Depp shows with his reclaimed youthfulness his life can only go up as does his happiness yet this is unjustifiably rejected by ""responsible"", ""sensible"" and ""mature"" adults. Depp's characters knows they are wrong through his writing and newfound appreciation of life but more importantly the people close to Depp know it and can see it to be true. In this way though, Finding Neverland may give us the key clue on how to find ourself.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The beauty in it all.,"So when the screen went white with a small black ""The End"" written subtly in the middle, I felt the tear which tried four times in the past one-and half hours to roll on my cheek, finally did so. But I didn't feel what it was for: grief, joy or nostalgia. Whatever it is, ""Finding Neverland"" touched me like no other movie I saw this year did. And I don't think I know why. One cannot attribute this responsibility to any single aspect of a film like excellent acting by the whole cast, wonderfully written screenplay, magnificent set designs or brilliant cinematography to make Barrie's visions come alive. A movie such as this simply has to excel in everything to build such a strong emotional framework in the audience's mind. If any one is to give credit, the closest person is then director Marc Forster.Today, when showing young-age imagination on movie screen inevitably means large bouts of special computerized visual and sound effects, it is a relief to see Forster depended primarily on detailed set designs and camera-work to achieve that. I don't know, but that seems paying actual homage to James Barrie himself. And what a treat that was. Every time the sets abruptly changed to make us see through Barrie's vision, when he played with the children or when he pictures Neverland to himself or to Sylvia, what I admired is Forster's vision. Just see this: when Barrie was playing the pirate scene with the kids in his cottage garden, it's all the ship, the rain, the artificially-made water etc on his (as well as ours) eyes, but every time Peter utters an out-of-place word, the scenes changed back to the cottage garden. Oh, how I liked that part. And when Barrie sees the children fly out through the window when they were jumping on their bed, that was perhaps the most beautiful scene in the movie.If the credits for the visions of Mr. Barrie goes to Forster, that for the attitude certainly goes to Johnny Depp. Depp once again proves he is one of the few finest actors in Hollywood today. It's just unfortunate for him that he faces tough challenge every time he gets nominated for the Academy Award. Depp's J.M. Barrie comes with a calm, reserved yet strikingly warm and caring personality. And Depp managed that Scottish accent extremely well. And how nicely he fits into every character Barrie himself plays in his sessions with the kids. And he belts out some memorable quotes like no one else could have done... ""Just a dog?"" or ""See? The boy is gone."" for example and if you've seen the movie you'll know what I'm talking about. It is by far the best performance he has ever done, keeping in mind ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" or ""Donnie Brasco"".And definitely, it is the best Kate Winslet I've ever seen too. I haven't seen ""Eternal Sunshine..."" but Kate as Sylvia is much more masterful than even Kate as Iris Murdoch. She is one of the rare actresses with a physical beauty that really makes such roles possible now-a-days. And how glorious she looks in a simple early twentieth century outfit. Her portrayal of Sylvia is flawless in every aspect of the character: joy, grief, contempt or sufferance as a patient. Watch her when she asks ""What's it like?"" despite of her grief for her dead husband and her chest pain when Barrie tells her about Neverland.But it'd all be wrong if there were not Dustin Hoffman, Julie Christie and Radha Mitchell for the supporting roles. Hoffman plays Barrie's producer with immense personality. He is intimidating, but never harsh. He is a realist, yet he believes in talent. And he is never egotistic. These traits suited Hoffman nicely. For Mitchell, hers was not the best, but she manages to do what she was supposed to do. But Julie Christie's performance is a real surprise for the film. I'd like to see more of her in such character roles.All the kids did a great job. It's not feasible to point out little mistakes in their acting but I think it would be a little better if the eldest boy, George could be played with a bit more emotion. But let's forget that. As long as we got this level of mastery in acting, directing and script-writing (""He is the real Peter Pan"") I think I'd leave this review utterly without any kind of negative remark. Once again, it is a movie to watch in every kind of mental condition and definitely needs a second viewing. As someone else pointed out, if I see one movie this year let it be that.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best movies I have ever seen!!!,"Perfectionby Amber FarnhamJohnny Depp puts on a Scottish accent for his new role as J. M. Barrie in Finding Neverland. It is an absolutely fabulous movie depicting the life of the famous playwright and the family that inspired his celebrated masterpiece. Filled with an excellent cast with perfect chemistry, this movie is bound to become an instant classic. J.M. Barrie is a famous playwright who has not been able come up with a decent piece of theater in a long time. That is until he takes his dog for a walk one day in the park. There he encounters the widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (played by Kate Winslet) and her sons. They play in the park for hours and their relationship was forged. As he spends more time with the family, especially young Peter (Freddie Highmore), he becomes inspired to create a play like none other, but as he spends more time with the family rumors begin to spread that Barrie's relationship with the Davies improper. Believing these rumors is Sylvia's mother Mrs. Emma Du Maurier (played by Julie Christie) and Barrie's wife, Mary (played by Rahda Mitchell), but Barrie refuses to give up his relationship with the family and treats them like members of his own family. Life is wonderful until Sylvia becomes ill.Her sons are forced to carry the huge burden of their mother's illness on their shoulders and all of them seem to handling it well, except for Peter. He is devastated by the recent loss of his father and hates the fact that the adults are not telling him the whole truth about his mother's sickness Sylvia's mother, Mrs. Emma Du Maurier does not allow Barrie to visit Sylvia or the boys, saying that he has done enough harm, and then Barrie's wife leaves him because he is spending more time with the Davies than with her. Through all of this, Barrie is able to write his masterpiece, and pretty soon it is the night of his most unconventional production, Peter Pan. Sylvia and her boys are rushing around the house trying to arrive at the theater on time, when Sylvia becomes sick again. Forced to stay home, Sylvia sends Peter to go see the play while she stays home. The play begins. The audience is awed by what they are witnessing and soon the play is over. At the after party, the audience is even more shocked to find out that Peter Pan is a real boy, the one who is standing there with Barrie! The ending, beautifully done, presents the viewer with one of the most touching scenes in the movie and a glimpse of Barrie's land through his own eyes.This movie is one of the most beautiful pieces of cinematography that was ever made. The cast was perfectly selected, and they all gave the performances of their lifetimes. Young Freddie Highmore was excellent as Peter in this movie, and he and all the other cast members deserve every award and praise they might receive for their performances. I would recommend this movie to everybody. From the moment you sit down to the moment the credits scroll across the screen, this movie will keep you enthralled every second you're watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
a beautiful and instructive story....,"Dreams, imagination, freedom, enthusiasm, peace with yourself! This is how I would describe ""Finding Neverland"" after seeing it. It proved me once again that beauty stays in the eye of the beholder, meaning that one story is a different story once you allow yourself to look at it from another point of view. The movie shows us where the creator of Petre Pan got his inspiration from. And does it in a beautiful way. I was not a fan of the Peter Pan story, but now I do want to see it again so I can pay more attention to the details. Although this movie made a positive impression on me and reminded me of the fact that we should live every minute the way it makes us happy, it failed to stick with me for more than a second. And I think that happened because it's all just too perfect in the way things happen and that makes it full of clichés. All in all, it's a good movie that deserves to be seen for the revealing insights on the story of Peter Pan and for the nice feeling that it creates.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Definitely not Oscar material.,"I can't quite put my finger on it why, but this movie feels moderately executed. One of the few things that feel genuine is the representation of the era (costumes, production design). What also draws one's attention is the crafted performance of Johnny Depp and the surprisingly natural performance of Freddie Highmore. Along with the powerful last scene of the film, these are what ""Finding Neverland"" has to offer in my opinion.I found the direction somewhat poorly paced, without a sense of rhythm, not at all helped by the not-so-skilled editing. Photography also gave me a bad impression, when the actors' faces were shadowed and obscure in closed sets. As for the rest of the performances, Dustin Hoffman was totally in the background, Julie Christie and Radha Mitchell were (again, in my opinion) bad, and even Kate Winslet didn't seem to have seethed her teeth into her role (especially in comparison with her wonderful work in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"").Apparently, the film has a message to deliver, about the Neverland in each and every one of us, about growing up and mature but still remaining a kid etc. It's clearly up to the viewer, how much he will yield to that message and subsequently to the magic of the movie. I admit I wasn't all that carried away. The message of ""Finding Neverland"" is unfortunately contained in a poor package.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stunning Movie!,"Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, two amazing performers. Now, throw in Dustin Hoffman, Julie Chrisite, and four adorable children and you're in for a treat: Finding Neverland; a story about a play write, Sir James M. Barrie, who meets a woman named Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, with four children, who doesn't have a husband. The family inspires him to write a story about children that don't want to grow up, evidently following the path of the story ""Peter Pan"". I really didn't expect to like the film as much as I did. I heard about it and was anxious to see it, probably for the fact that Johnny Depp was in it. I thought, ""Hm... story about a writer... whatever"", when I first heard about it. It didn't seem to be much of a big deal, but it is. I read about it on the computer to see if I'd want to go see it. It seemed interesting, but I wasn't dying to see it. I decided I'd wait until it was out on video. I was nudged by many of my friends to rent it and watch it, since they had thought it was stunning.Three words: They were right! I watched it with lots of my friends at a party. Lots of them were goofing off at random points in the movie, but I felt hooked onto it. It was wonderful. I was pleased by Kate Winslets terrific and tragic performance. Johnny Depp was, as usual, stunning. He delivered a most sophisticated performance that was very touching, especially the ending scene. The children in the movie were perfect. Freddie Highmore was amazing. His acting was wonderful for such a young child. His performance was beautiful, especially in the last scene. If you see or have seen the movie, I'm sure you'll know what I mean. The emotions that wave throughout the movie are beautiful, and really touch your heart. Not only is there plenty of drama, tragedy, and make believe, but there's of course plenty of comical moments, too.The film will most likely bore younger children, but I think teens and adults will find it quite lovely. This movie is full of beautiful use of imagination and delivers a sweet message. I think the ending was just beautiful, despite the fact that the screen was rather blurry, since my eyes were filled with tears. I remember hearing sniffles and seeing tissues being pulled out of their box from my friends as the credits rolled on. The ending is bitter sweet and very touching.

Very Beautiful Movie,"In 1903, in England, the play writer James Matthew Barrie (Johnny Depp) has a complete lack of inspiration, and his last work was a deceptive play. When he meets the children of the widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet), he becomes friend of the family and Sylvia becomes his muse and her children the source of inspiration. James writes the successful play about ""Peter Pan and Neverland"".This romanced version about the life of Sir James Matthew Barrie, the author of Peter Pan, is really a very beautiful movie. Who has not read the book of Peter Pan and the Neverland? Who has not seen at least one movie of PeterPan? However, the screenplay of ""Finding Neverland"" is completely original, showing the ""behind the scene"" of the creation of Peter Pan in a magnificent way. There are many deviations from the biography of James Matthew Barrie, but the wonderful screenplay highlights the essence. The story is touching, the direction is outstanding and tight, and the brilliant performances of Johnny Depp, Kate Wisnlet, Julie Christie and the children are awesome.

It manages some magical moments...,"Preconceived for triumph and tragedy, ""Finding Neverland"" has a great idea but doesn't quite stay on track. The story of playwright James M. Barrie--and the building up to the opening-night stage performance of his ""Peter Pan""--has exciting flourishes, but flourishes are what the film seems to be built upon, and the leftover dramatics are shallow. The opening scene (chronicling a Barrie-written flop) is painfully underwritten; we don't even get the name of the play being performed (and the audience is shown actually falling asleep in the theater!). Dustin Hoffman, as a producer, barely has a character to portray and we never know where he stands--is he a business partner? faithful friend? tireless worker? Johnny Depp stays in a low-key as Barrie and doesn't exhaust his handsomeness, but Kate Winslet's role as the mother of Barrie's muses gets stuck with a deadweight role: ill, she is less a character and more precisely a patient. Fast-forward to the play itself for the real Neverland; that's when the movie accumulates some substantial magic and takes flight. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

This is a really great film with really great actors.,Being a great fan of Johnny Depp I loved it. He had great chemistry with Kate Winslet and all the children on the movie. I've only seen three other films he has been in and this one so far has been his best performance. I also loved the way they showed how vast J.M. Barrie's imagination was by them going back and forth between what was actually happening and what was happening in Mr. Barrie's imagination. This is a wonderful show and I think it should have swept the Oscars personally and that everyone should go and see it. I think Freddie Highmore did a wonderful job as Peter. You can see his emotion and how he struggles from knowing his mother is sick and trying to be an adult when he really should be a child.

The script just seemed rushed and the movie moved way to fast to began to like any of the characters. I didn't get teared eyed when kate's character died because I didn't feel that her and Depp developed enough chemistry for there to be ""love"". The movie rushed to fast for that.

"An enjoyable yet flawed biopic, with a fantastic lead performance worthy of a higher quality motion picture","Although ""Finding Neverland"" is a fine biopic of Peter Pan creator J.M. Barrie (played by Johnny Depp), it is also fairly standard in regards to the method it uses to approach the formulaic biopic; I got the feeling I had seen something like this before. The emotional moments all rang true but they still seemed eerily similar to other films of the genre.However the lead performance by Johnny Depp is truly marvelous and he deserved an Oscar more than Clint Eastwood, at least in my humble opinion. It's hard enough to act as well as he does in this film; perfecting the accent is even harder. And he does both equally, exceedingly well.The cast all do their best. It's nice to see Julie Christie back on the screen again and Kate Winslet, although fitting, didn't make a huge impression as I'd seen her play similar roles in the past. The most visible casting oddity has to be Dustin Hoffman; I couldn't tell if he was playing an Englishman or an American. His accent was uneven and role seemed strangely out-of-place, as if they cast him only for the sake of irony. (Some might recall he played Captain Hook in Steven Spielberg's ""Hook."")I enjoyed the movie but it was not the most original film to come out of Hollywood in recent years. Like many biopictures it follows the same sort of formula - I hate to call it ""sappy"" because that sounds demeaning, but it's somewhat true.For example, although it's a true story, the film still manages to exaggerate all the right moments in order to tug on the audience's heartstrings; the effect is somewhat manipulative and definitely ""glossed over.""Overall ""Finding Neverland"" is different from the Peter Pan stories we are familiar with, and remains fairly truthful to J.M. Barrie's life. Johnny Depp is superb and the film is amusing and worth seeing. It is not, however, what I would call a ""masterpiece,"" nor is it one of a kind.

Schmaltz-o-rama.,"This is a very sweet film, and enjoyable. But for the life of me I do not know how it could have snagged a Best Picture and Best Actor nomination over KINSEY and its outstanding leading performance by Liam Neeson, who was totally robbed. Maybe from the general public, but the industry that votes on these awards should know better. Furthermore, it makes no sense that critics dismissed THE NOTEBOOK as ""schmaltzy"" while this film that milks the tearful eyes of Freddie Highmore for all they're worth was given a pass on the schmaltz-o-meter. Come on! The film doesn't pick up until the production of Peter Pan is underway. Up to that point, it drags, and there is little conflict to keep us interested other than what's bubbling beneath the surface in good performances by Radha Mitchell (as Mrs. Barrie) and a superbly surly Julie Christie.Johnny Depp's performance is good, but not the phenomenon that he was in POTC. He's well cast. But is he better than Neeson, or the Oscar-snubbed Paul Giamatti, Kevin Kline (De-Lovely), Javier Bardem, or Tom Hanks (The Ladykillers)? Not this time, I'd say.Yes, there are magical elements of the film that make it all worthwhile, but the way it is set up to unfold so predictably is a noticeable flaw that slightly dulls the shine of the wonderful parts.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

The dialgue in this film is wonderful too, it's beautifully written.In all honesty i didn't enjoy this film, right up until the end, when i literally cried my eyes out, it was so sad and beautiful at the same time. I wish the rest of the film had plucked at my emotions in the same way. That would've made me rate this film much higher.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unnoriginal and boring,"Animated by the promising reviews everywhere i went to see this film, and i can tell you i will never trust critics again, this awful piece of cinematography is a waste of peoples time, and i am sorry for every cent spent on celluloid for this should have been a straight to TV film at TNT or the history channel at best, it is boring, uninspired, slow, awfully edited, there are some promising parts inside the writers imagination but they seem to be taking of into something actually good when it plummets into the cheap drama, easy metaphors, and an ocean of common places.the subdrama of the dyng mother is as cliché and its outcome so predictable as kate winslet's performance. A shallow unmemorable character for a shallow unmemorable movie. It's the Shakespeare in love formula applied to kids (minus gwynet and the good humor). It wont decide between the actual subject of the movie, either the creative process, the relationship with the kids or the relationship with the mother, IT could be considered as a whole but since obviously the director doesn't have the talent to touch all this points at once, the uncompromised movie fails to deliver almost every message it tries to get across.Save your money, rent it if you'd like, don't keep feeding the greedy industry, rewarding it for bad movies with good PR executives.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A fantastic world,"I believe that the film is fantastic in all sense. In the first place the atmosphere. This obtained very well. It is a true trip to London. Secondly the great work of Jonhy Depp. This man is a fabulous actor. The film is a trip and that is most valuable that it has. It transports you to another world. Jonhy is a true dreamer, a true lover of its work. For that reason it leaves his woman who does not understand it. To be able to continue taking refuge in his fantasies.

Finding Neverland,"Okay... I have now seen this movie 4 times... I have never been too fond of Johnny Depp. However... he shines in this movie. I must say that the little boys in this movie were amazing.. I have never seen such great child acting!!!!!! I have never wept so much in a movie. If anyone wants to see it call me... Ill come with!!!!! Kate Winslet was flawless.. Her portrayal of a widow raising 4 playful, smart boys while casting her own problems off to the side was unmatched by anyone. She should earn an academy award for such acting... The superb boys in this movie (especially ""Peter"") were unmatched in acting of children... They had so much passion and love for one another as well as their mother and James. If only every movie could be this great!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not Bad,"In 1903, in England, the play writer J.M. Barrie has a complete lack of inspiration, and his last work was a deceptive play.

A beautiful and moving peace of art,"I understand it now. The movie on the play has to be many times more beautiful than the play itself. The play showed the beauty and freedom of magic. But the movie about the author of the play on the other hand, will show through the author's own eyes, the magic that he saw in the real world.This is precisely what the movie has managed to achieve. It also shows that happiness can be found in just our imagination too. It shows that human beings though made cynical and calculating by the reality of the world would grab the chance to be in a world that has beauty, wonder and magic to set them free.I have watched many movies. I barely shed a tear through any of them. This one had me sobbing. It is not all that sad. It's just beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Peter : ""I'm Peter, just Peter. I like my name.""","I'm writing this comment right after I've seen the movie, because I'm so full of it so I can't stand it. I've seen a few movies about Peter Pan and I didn't like them so much. But this one is masterpiece. The movie consists of three parts. The funny childish part. The sentimental adult part. And the very sad part.The first part shows young man who does not want to grow up. He's married, but he spends more time with the boys in park than with his wife. He likes to play. He dances with the dog and acts as it is a bear and has more fun than the audience watching him. And when he played the captain of a pirate ship? Who can be better for this role then J.D.?The second part is about adults. Grown up people desperately trying to ""find Neverland"". But they can't. It's gone. It vanished long ago, because they had grown up. But a few of them still can find it and even show it to others. I liked Mr. and Mrs. Snow from this part. The old couple that still ""believes in fairies"".The third part will make you never forget this movie. It shows the young boys confronted with the real life. When one parent is dead and the other is going to die, the children simply cannot be fooled. They grow up instantly, in the second they realize there is no room for children's games. When young George (Nick Roud) talks with James (or with his grandmother afterward) you see that it's not the same George who ""imprisoned"" his younger brother under the park bench just because ""he was his younger brother"". The young kid Peter had really taken my heart. I've seen him before in Mists of Avalon as the young Arthur and there he was very good too.I cannot pick one badly acted role in this movie. Even the man playing the dog Nana was perfect. The young boys really outdid themselves. Johnny Depp was wonderful. And even all the other small roles were very good acted. So don't wait, go and WATCH it.P.S. : Sorry for my English.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Truly Touching Movie that will give you a Different View of the World,"Finding Neverland, a movie of the life of Sir James Matthew Barrie, his relationship with the Lewellyn Davies family, and imagination. All of these points were delivered perfectly. Johnny Depp portrays J.M. Barrie, a playwright who recently had no acclaim for his play. He needs to think of a good one because his impresario Charles Frohman is breathing down his neck. While in the park one day he runs into a perfect inspiration for his play, the Davies family, Peter, Jack, George, Michael, and Sylvia, the mother, which leads him to write Peter Pan.Much speculation has arisen over the years that Barrie had an inappropriate relationship with the Davies boys, so this story would be short lived today. But with Johnny Depp in charge, he makes the character believable, and 100% acceptable.And Kate Winslet delivers an outstanding performance also. With her Oscar Nominatated performance for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind behind her, it is amazing that she can come so close to rising above that. Barries love for her is not shown much, because he makes it so innocent. The drama in her life is kept to a low level, and the movie does not focus around that, even though she comes down with an alarming cough.Also a surprisingly good performance comes from Freddie Highmore, playing the part of Peter Davies. This new actor most likely has an amazing carrier ahead of him, already done with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, again with Depp.Another incredible point this movie drives home is imagination, with multiple references to it by Barrie, and multiple scenes such as a pirate ship and...I wont spoil it. Barrie keeps telling the boy to imagine things, by believing, dreaming, and making it real for yourself.Honestly, best movie of the year. It was amazing, and do not be scared of the PG rating. Much better than Depp's performance in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.I came out with a different view of the world, and I think you will to. It's a moral, wonderful movie, and is number one on my list.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Neat, nice and very emotional - pulling at the human race's collective heartstrings","I think that 'Peter Pan' is a story so classical and so embedded in our hearts, that a film dealing with the man behind the works and the boys who inspired his imagination, is just bound to touch you.Finding Neverland proves me right in this. It bravely plunges into the whimsical imagination land of J.M Barrie (Johnny Depp), documenting his life and experiences in the year that he wrote the play Peter Pan -- the boy who never grew up. Moreover, we follow Barrie as he develops a strong bond with a family of a mother (Kate Winslet) and her four lively boys. These are the charismatic, nuanced characters who inspire the author to write, feel and believe.Marc Forster's Finding Neverland is a quiet, somewhat flawed, masterpiece. I say 'quiet' because it is not a film that revolutionizes anything or completely blows you away - it is a lovely little piece that warms your heart. It features a uniformly strong cast, a cute storytelling technique and overall satisfying developments in the plot which is kept focused by assured direction.Although it is deeply emotional most often in a classy kind of way, Finding Neverland falls prey to the cheesy Hallmark moment approach on one or two occasions, and you feel that it sometimes jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely. This is mainly in regards to Sylvia's frosty authoritative mother who goes through the clichéd character developments (I won't spoil anything here, but you can guess it). I suppose I fell victim to this however, seeing as how I cried uncontrollably for nearly the entire second half.I noticed something interesting about this film; the format in which it was shot is different from anything I've ever seen, appearing just a bit more colorful than the average blockbuster -- sharp colour contrasts, seemingly highlighting each detail. This is a nice colourful touch to an already colourful film. A strong 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Huge Lie of a Movie,"This movie is very touching and would have been a masterpiece had it not been so misleading.Many historians have called Barrie a pedophile, and for good reason. Barrie was impotent and unable to love women (that is what apparently drove his wife in Gilbert's arms) so he turned his affection to children instead. He would take nude pictures of the 5 Davies boys (does child pornography come to mind?), would write George Davies 2000 letters a day (which were later burned by the family), even in one confessing that he was ' more and more wishing you were a girl of 21 instead of boy, so that I could say the things to you that are now always in my heart '. In his writings (such as 'Little White Bird', read for yourself) he reveals a disturbing and darker side of himself - a sexual desire for children and even his frustration with it.Even though none of the Davies boys ever said anything about such an incident happening, one is left wondering as to why two of the boys committed suicide. Michael drowned himself with a male friend in some sort of strange pact, and Peter, despite becoming a successful publisher later on in life, threw himself under a train a month before the centenary of Barrie's birth.The whole of ""Finding Neverland' makes Barrie out to be some sort of loving and very wise father figure when in fact he was a deeply disturbed, lonely, and insecure social outcast who was sexually aroused by children. This is only typical of Hollywood, who the same year produced a movie celebrating another pedophile, Alfred Kinsey.We cannot forget last year's 'Monster', which is done so brilliantly it even makes us feel sorry for serial killer Aileen Wuornos. When one watches this movie after having read about the true twisted character of Barrie, everything about 'Finding Neverland' just seems artificial in essence.I found it intensely depressing, knowing that with it being such an immaculately made, touching story, not to mention the Oscar nods and rave reviews it received, people who don't care enough to dig any deeper will forever see Barrie as the wonderful, practically perfect human being he is made out to be in 'Finding Neverland'. This movie is a tragedy, just like the lives of the Davies' family and James Barry himself.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Beautiful story, beautiful setting, beautiful acting","This is easily the best film I've seen in the past twelve months. As I left the theater, it dawned upon me that I don't remember a bad Johnny Depp movie. The man has a golden touch and he knows how to pick his roles.""Finding Neverland"" is the story of James Barrie, the author of Peter Pan. It revolves around his relationship with the Llewellyn Davies family: Sylvia, the mother; her four sons, George, Michael, Peter and Jack; and Mrs. Emma du Maurier, Sylvia's mother. Sylvia and her four sons were his main inspiration for the characters in Peter Pan.The movie is a particularly effective portrayal of what occurs in an author's head as he is developing a story. It shows how he takes little bits of his own life, and that of others around him, creates a metaphor for the events, and translates it into a story.It also maintains the adage that an author must live through personal pain if he is to produce a masterpiece. In this case, Barrie has a difficult relationship with his wife. Try as he might, he cannot get her to embrace and accept the fantasies that inhabit his mind. Like Peter Pan, Barrie is a man that hasn't grown up. He lives in a world filled with Indians and pirates, crocodiles and sharks, fairies and flying children.When he meets with the Llewellyn Davies family, he finds warmth, smiles and happiness that don't exist at home. He spends more and more time with them, at the expense of his wife. All the while, he is slowly crafting his masterpiece.The acting is top-notch. All the characters are believable and draw you into their world. I was amazed by the various children's performance. The camera work is dazzling. I especially enjoyed the way certain scenes alternated between the real and the imaginary.This is the kind of movie that stirs a deep longing inside of me, a longing to write something significant, touching, and entertaining. I'm not one to buy movies but as the credits started rolling, my first thought was ""I have to buy this movie when it comes out on DVD."" Hopefully that will be around my birthday.""Finding Neverland"" is a definite and very enthusiastic 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The magically told story of James M. Barrie's inspiration for writing his most popular work Peter Pan is 5 stars beyond brilliant!!!,"Finding Neverland is a fantastic piece of work. The acting is amazing. Johnny Depp achieves such greatness in his role as J.M. Barrie. He does such a great job of illustrating subtlety, which is not only more effective and believable, but also harder to do. Also, it doesn't have that big blockbuster feel, which means the risk of feeling like someone is shoving this story down your throat isn't present. No, there'll be no choking down of this film. It flows with the greatest of ease. Depp's sheer and utter brilliance is complemented by an amazing supporting cast consisting of Kate Winslet, who gives an awe inspiring performance as Sylvia Lewelyn Davies; Freddie Highmore, who as Peter himself,proves to the audience, that he is quite the scene stealer; Radha Mitchell as Mr. Barrie's beautiful (and lonesome, once Barrie meets the Lewelyn-Davies family)wife; and Julie Christie, as Kate Winslet's mother. The film shows Barrie's good heart, through his various acts of kindness for the Lewelyn-Davies family. He gives them what they need: a trip away from reality, but by the end, everyone in the story learns, that ""you can't just go on pretending,"" to quote Depp as Barrie. The beautiful world Barrie has created in his limitless mind is more than just a place. It's a point of view: a state of mind. With a tear-jerking ending conversation between James Barrie and Peter, any human being with a heart will at the very least feel the souls of the characters drawn into their own hearts. It's completely absorbing and undoubtedly one of the VERY best films of the year. And finally, out of the most important lessons of all that are conveyed throughout the film, stands the one that applies to both reality and imagination: ""just believe.""",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A leap to Neverland,"Finding Neverland is a slight but charming film about the wonders of imagination in the stuffy Edwardian era England.Johnny Depp plays the softly spoken in a Scots accent, J M Barrie who has just come off a failed play.Barrie has a strained marriage but a chance meeting with a recent widow (Kate Winslet) and her four young boys inspires his imaginations and whimsy as he becomes involved in their lives causing further stress in his own marriage.The children inspires the story of Peter Pan as we go to and from reality and fantasy. However adults are always the sore point. Barrie's producer and financier (Dustin Hoffman) thinks little of this strange play with red Indians, fairy lights, an overgrown dog, a ticking crocodile and just thinks he will lose more money. Julie Christie as Winslet's frosty mother is wary of Barrie and think he is a disruptive influence.Marc Forster directs with aplomb and makes good use of visual trickery and gets enchanting and solid performances from his young actors such as Freddie Highmore.However it is a slight story, semi fictionalised and also wastes some of its actors. Dustin Hoffman who appeared in Steven Spielberg's Hook is wasted and just disappears from the film. Once Winslet falls ill you can guess where this is heading and gets a little too sentimental.The film is heightened by a restrained and gentle performance by Depp.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Good, but too simple, definitely not one of the year's best","""Finding Neverland"" is a lot like ""Ray"", though not as good. They are both about men whose childhoods are practically destroyed by family tragedy but who create something magical and long-lasting in their adult lives, through the influence of others. ""Ray"" was about a very influential black singer; ""Finding Neverland"" is about the writer of ""Peter Pan"". Both premises could've been made into great movies. But, strangely, only ""Ray"" was great.Oh, ""Finding Neverland"" was good, but it was just too simple too be even compared to many of this year's movies, including ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"", ""Collateral"", ""The Passion of the Christ"", ""Closer"" and ""The Life Aquatic"". Not to say simple movies aren't as good as complex ones, but the solutions this movie offers seems a lot more geared for children than adults, or even all-ages. I'm wondering if this is on purpose, because the film is essentially a bio-pic, and bio-pics are generally not one of children's basic genres.Of course I may be alone on this, everyone else seems to love it, but I find it very surprising that this film could inspire any form of adult. Its main message is ""with your imagination you can accomplish anything"", which we've all heard, since we were very young, from many sources. Of course maybe it takes a simple little movie to remind you of it.So the Scottish Sir James Barrie (Johnny Depp) has writer's block, and his last play was a flop, and his impresario (Dustin Hoffman) is getting skeptical. His wife Mary Ansell (Radha Mitchell) is a little distant  he is not least at fault  and he spends his days sitting in the local park, writing in his notebook. One day he finds that a little boy is lying under his shoe, and then he meets the boys' brothers, and widow mother, Sylvia Llewelyn-Davies (Kate Winslet). Immediately he is smitten with the family, but not romantically, mind you. No, in a way Sir Barrie wants to be the boys' brother, and Sylvia's son.But some people get in the way: Sylvia's mother, Mrs. Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie), Mary, and one of Sylvia's sons Peter (Freddie Highmore) are all fiercely against the union of James and the Davies family. Of course, to everyone but James, Sylvia and the other boys their time together looks scandalous and, well, creepy, but they understand that they are all just a big, happy family.Johnny Depp is skillful in playing characters that are in their own element  actually, come to think of it, all of his leading characters have some strange quirk that puts them in their own world. An android with sharp hands, an illiterate Buster Keaton fan, the worst film director of all time, one of the best drug dealers of all time, a drunken fruity pirate, a deadly CIA agent, and a shadowy authortake your pick. All of them completely different, except for the similarity of being one hundred percent unique. And now another to add to the list: Sir J.M. Barrie. This character's quirky curse is that his childhood was all but stolen from him (for reasons I wont spoil), and so he spends his adult life trying to steal it back. Yes, indeed, there is no romance between James and Sylvia, because at the age James is really at, girls to him are a still unfamiliar being who are there to look nice and clean (which makes his wedding with Mary a complete mystery). But James has still the wisdom and experience of an adult, so he seems less like he has a problem than a cute quirk. Johnny Depp balances this perfectly, it's a great performance.But not as great as that of Liam Neeson, Jamie Foxx, Tom Cruise, Paul Giamatti or Bill Murray. I seriously think this film is being over-praised. Depp was great, but not amazing, and most of the rest of the cast is underused  especially Hoffman  though Radha Mitchell shines. The movie itself isn't really a mass achievement eithersure, the costumes, sets and cinematography were great, but I think all that should be second to the writing and direction, which, I'm sad to say, isn't all that great. And there's an awkward scene at the end with Winslet, in her house, that would work a lot better as a dream or some sort of fantasy.So it's not a must-see, but you would enjoy parts if you watched it, and Depp and Mitchell turn in some good work, so I won't discourage you from seeing it. Just watch the other movies I mentioned first.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Johnny Depp Plays a Normal Human Being, For Once","This gloopy biopic about J.M. Barrie and the events that inspired ""Peter Pan"" almost made me angry at how grossly manipulative it was, and all the more angry that it managed to work on me anyway.Johnny Depp plays Barrie in one of the only roles he's played in the last many years that resembles a real living person. Kate Winslet and Freddie Highmore are both terrific as a brother and sister who befriend Barrie, much to the disapproval of a stern and uptight mother (Julie Christie).The film's final scenes, in which Winslet's character dies gracefully while Barrie unleashes a barrage of fantasy to help make her last moments on earth tolerable, are maudlin and unforgivingly sentimental --- and they managed to have me reduced to sobs.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Best in Genre,"To review a film like Finding Neverland, rather to APPRECIATE a film like Finding Neverland, you have to know what it sets out to accomplish.It's clear that Marc Forster, along with practically everybody involved with the production, has a deep connection to J.M. Barrie's play. Because of this, it accurately depicts J.M. Barrie's life. Are there a few ""poetic license"" liberties taken? Naturally. As we all know, real life is simply not that interesting.Forster's direction is amazing. The coordination with the cinematographer, along with his usage of grace notes (the tainting of the tea is brilliant) is perhaps the film's strongest points. The score, winner of the Oscar, is brilliant: whimsical while melancholy.The performances are subdued, yet they still qualify as exceptional. Some on this board have criticized Johnny Depp. Most on this board are not bona fide film critics, nor am I. Even so, Mr. Depp gave an intricately laced performance, complete with a terrific dialect, while refraining from eccentric mannerisms. Winslet and Julie Christie are charming and, in the case of the latter, somehow lovable by the end. Hoffman is his usual terrific self, and the newcomer Freddie Highmore delivers a breakthrough performance.The film's only weak spot is the very thing that makes it fantastic. This film will probably make you cry. I did. My family did. We all did. Some may feel manipulated into crying, and in a sense you ARE. Even so, Forster succeeded in making you cry or at the very least feel an overwhelming sense of awe and beauty. Not many films that I can think of, and I'm really racking my brain here, have been able to derive tears from sheer beauty rather than manipulated guilt.In closing, this is a professionally done, admirable, beautiful film. It has its detractors, but I'd presume many of them are just too emotionally closeted to reveal their inner child. And revealing ones inner child is exactly what Finding Neverland does.

Depp delivers.....again,"Johnny Depp is finally starting to get the recognition he has long deserved. After his film debut in 1984's 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', Depp worked 19 years to get his first Oscar nomination for 'Pirates of the Caribbean' in 2003. His other roles in 'Benny and Joon' 'Ed Wood' and 'Donnie Brasco' are all Oscar worthy but he was never recognized. In 'Finding Neverland', Depp plays J.M. Barrie, creator of the Peter Pan legend. The film innocently tells of the inspiration for his literary creation of miracle and wonder. Kate Winslet plays the mother in a family of boys from whom Barrie draws his inspiration after courting her and becoming a father figure to the young men. Julie Christie plays the boys' grandmother who disapproves of Barrie's relationship with the boys.

Entetaining,"I would never have watched this film if it hadn't had Kate Winslet in it. It was a lot better than I thought it would be. Kate Winslet has to be the top tragedienne in the business today. She was perfect, understating her beauty, and playing the Edwardian mother role wonderfully. Johnny Depp is a phenomenal actor, playing the widest variety of roles. He hit the accent as well as Meryl Streep, never missing a single line in it, yet never overdoing it. The whole thing is kind of creepy nowadays though, in these Michael Jackson times. It is really unseemly for a man to pay too much attention to someone else's sons. The idea, I suppose is that Barrie was a child-man, someone who never wanted to grow up. Well, that's how they used to describe Jackson, too, and of course he named his molestation-hideout, uh, I mean, ranch, Neverland. Kinda weird. Anyway Radha Mitchell looked wonderful, and played her part beautifully as well. It ended up being a really entertaining movie, well worth a place in a Netflix queue.

Beautifully Touching and Perfectly Cast,"Imagine a wonderful film with no violence, no obscenities, and no torrid love scene...FINDING NEVERLAND proves that, yes, it still can be done successfully in this day and age and stand strongly against other films.Johnny Depp play the title role as the author of Peter Pan, struggling from writer's block after his last play flops. Kate Winslet is wonderful as Sylvia Llewelyn-Davies, the widowed mother of 4 boys and head of the family who inspire Barrie to write Peter Pan. Julie Christie is great as the grandmother you love to hate--fearful for her daughter's reputation, but also ""protecting what she has"" as she puts it during a strong talk with Barrie.The 4 young men who play the Davies brothers are especially impressive. They look and act like brothers and hardly seem to be acting at all because they are so natural. Note that all 4 of the boys lended their names to the story: John (Jack) and Michael are Wendy's younger brothers, George is the father (and the oldest son), and of course Peter is the boy who refuses to grow up. Legend has it that Barrie created the name Wendy and it was first heard in Peter Pan.Of course the stand-out young man is Freddie Highmore, who plays the young Peter from whom Barrie borrows the name of his title character. I think we'll see great things from him in the future. He'll be playing Charlie Bucket in Tim Burton's CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. Johnny Depp will be Willy Wonka. These are great roles for Johnny, who seems to be defying aging himself. Who knows how FINDING NEVERLAND would've turned out if Johnny Depp hadn't been cast as J.M. Barrie? Fortunately, we'll never know.Dustin Hoffman does a superb turn as Charles Frohman, Barrie's producer. Of course, we all know that Dustin Hoffman can do anything on screen, but it is fun to see him linked to Peter Pan once more after his hilarious turn as Captain Hook in HOOK, with Robin Williams.If differently cast, with different editing, this could've been a very boring movie. It certainly doesn't play like most of the modern-day films. Luckily for the viewers, it IS extremely well cast and well edited and you'll find yourself wanting to find Neverland again and again.

Director Marc Forster, whose only other credit I know is the melodramatic and overrated ""Monster's Ball"", draws fine performances from his cast, but the film itself is oddly uninvolving at least until the last twenty minutes. Forster, along with screenwriter David Magee, takes a rather reverential attitude toward their subject, and this beatific sense is heightened by the immaculate approach toward the production.The result seems targeted squarely at the Merchant-Ivory connoisseur of good taste, but somewhere along the way, the edges have been dulled, and the intensity of feeling that Barrie has for the boys has been mollified for a broader audience. Fortunately, Johnny Depp has been ideally cast as Barrie mimicking a convincing Scottish accent in a surprisingly restrained performance. Even so, his unsullied playfulness comes through in his scenes with the children even if they tend to go on ad nauseam. Looking almost too radiant with an innate inability to convey fragility, Kate Winslet has the saintly role of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, the sickly mother who lives selflessly for her boys while in self-denial about her undisclosed illness.Even more thankless is the role of Barrie's social climbing wife Mary played in an overly pinched manner by Radha Mitchell (take a look at the outtakes to see a much livelier actress at work). Because her character is drawn in such shallow strokes, the unspoken love implied between Barrie and Sylvia seems all the more distracting from the main point of the story, the parallel between life and fantasy in Barrie's writing of ""Peter Pan"". Unbelievably nearly forty years since her enigmatic Lara in David Lean's ""Doctor Zhivago"", Julie Christie plays the predictable part of Sylvia's unyielding, Gladys Cooper-type mother with conviction, supposedly the inspiration for Captain Hook. I only wish her character was developed more to match her well-missed talent. In an even smaller role, Dustin Hoffman plays money-conscious impresario Charles Frohman with welcome panache.All four boys are effortless though the standout is Freddie Highmore, who plays the pivotal role of third son Peter. He plaintively lends the gravity of a serious child recovering from his father's death and unwillingly in the throes of a man consumed with fantasy, especially poignant in the closing scene with Depp. The recreation of the original production of ""Peter Pan"" is done well, even the fanciful scenes toward the end. I also think credit is due to composer Jan A.P. Kaczmarek, who provides an ethereal and evocative musical score.The DVD has the standard set of extras. Forster, Magee and producer Richard Gladstein - though sadly none of the actors - provide informative commentary on an alternate audio track. There are three deleted scenes and about five minutes worth of outtakes which frankly could have blessedly goosed the pacing of the film. Of course, there is the expected making-of featurette, ""The Magic of Finding Neverland"" but also a quick film on the film's special effects which could have been much longer and a stars-on-the-red-carpet clip that is completely disposable.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
More than just a movie ...,"I watched 'Finding Neverland' one Sunday afternoon. I could have never imagined a more wondrous, poignant storytelling of behind-the-curtain events which inevitably led to the greatest achievement of James Barrie: the much treasured 'Peter Pan'.The movie follows Barrie (Depp) who, faced with a failing marriage and a writer's block, serendipitously encounters and is captivated by the Davies' boys. He indulges them with his powerful passion and enthusiasm for plays, and becomes more than a father figure to them, and in doing so gains the inspiration for his greatest creation.Johnny Depp's characterization of Barrie is worthy of applause. With a brilliant supporting cast, particularly Freddie Highmore and Julie Christie, the movie enraptures the audience, engaging them in its mellifluous narrative only to be left in a pensive mood for all its bittersweet and heart-wrenching moments.This semi-fictional work of art isn't just a film, but a cogent story of cherishing the child within, capable of welling up the eyes of the driest soul.Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"More subtlety, less schmaltz and this could have been great","Two performances - by Kate Winslet and young Freddie Highmore - save ""Finding Neverland"" from plummeting into a routine tearjerker.You have to admire Winslet. Here's a young woman who could have had her pick of any huge Hollywood movie following ""Titanic"" (1997). Instead, she decided to take on gutsy roles, women with real depth and feeling, in smaller films that took chances. ""Hideous Kinky"" (1998), ""Holy Smoke"" (1999) and ""Quills"" (2000).These movies might not have been financial hits or even complete cinematic successes. But Winslet made them memorable and proved what a genuinely talented and versatile performer she is. Even today, she avoids blockbusters for substantive roles in quirkier films, such as ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.""In ""Finding Neverland,"" Winslet plays Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, a young widow whose four young sons inspire J.M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) to write ""Peter Pan"" after they befriend him in a park. Barrie, recovering from a critical lambasting of his latest play, finds succor in their friendship, which also is the fillip he needs as the boys and their mother revel in his wild imagination.Depp fits Barrie well. He's so chameleon-like we forget we're watching Depp. He and a radiant Winslet, who could create sparks with anyone, complement each other perfectly. The boys are delightful, but young Highmore grips us with a raw performance as young Peter. It's no wonder Depp recommended him to director Tim Burton for ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.""In many ways, ""Finding Neverland"" is old-fashioned storytelling, using cinematic conventions of yore to politely show a character's declining health.The film looks beautiful. Wonderful cinematography. What bothered me is that director Marc Foster and screenwriter David Magee cop out when they had a fascinating story to tell. It's as if they know what to do to make the audience cry, so that's all they do. True, it works. Because at the screening I attended, several women were sobbing.Foster and Magee are so wrapped up in their film's magical aspect they don't bother with anything having to do with the reality of these people's lives. The supporting roles are weak. Superb actors - Radha Mitchell as Barrie's wife, Mary; Julie Christie as Sylvia's mom, Mrs. Emma du Maurier; and Dustin Hoffman as Barrie's backer, Charles Frohman - are entirely one-dimensional and given barely anything to do. Especially Mitchell's Mary, whose potential for passionate conflict is grossly underused. Foster and Magee make short shrift of these characters.Subtlety apparently is not Foster's forte. His over-rated ""Monster's Ball"" (2001) would have been more powerful were it less heavy-handed. In ""Finding Neverland,"" Foster treats his audience as fools. He does everything but superimpose ""This is symbolic"" in some scenes and goes to great lengths to point out the obvious about how Barrie thought of certain ideas. The boys leaping on their beds gives Barrie the idea to make his ""Peter Pan"" characters fly. We get it. There's no need to then actually show the boys flying. We're not that stupid.As a good-looking three-hankie tearjerker, ""Finding Neverland"" succeeds, I suppose. This film very likely will win awards. But this story deserved better than what Foster did with it.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Bad composition, Bad story-telling, Bad imagery, Bad character depiction","This movie relied heavily on (1) simplistic facial expression set in predictable scenes, and (2) the basic outline of the story featuring cliché message encouraging laughter and imagination. Everything else was distasteful. The director did a terrificly horrible job. He was bad.(I) Problem of Image:(a) Most shots remained too close to the actors' upper body... little variety in composition... the transition became monotone... the background was not well utilized...(b) The image quality was ordinary... nothing special... very movie...(c) The beauty of the time or stage was not used...(d) The theatrical and fantasy scenes lacked imagination...(* The rare good image was of Depp and Pete at the end. Most of the rest were junk.)(II) Problem of Story:(a) The character depictions went from surface to surface... There's Depp writing a little... There's his wife who reads a little bit... complains a little... There's Winslet who's a mother and who says Depp is fine... There's Winslet mom who's a little worried but who becomes quickly open to Depp... There's the children, who's cute or mature or rebellious or touching at times... There's Hoffman worried about money but who eventually recognizes Depp's achievement... But no depth... Nor is there great imagery... We see a bit of Peter Pan... just a tiny little petty bits... We have a tiny bit of fantasy... Very biographic movie... with little actual life in it.(Why did Depp get together with his wife... Depp seems very nice but also very weak... There's mention of the neglect of his mother... envy towards his brother... there's a sense that Depp's character is far more problematic than the movie depicts... most of Hoffman's character is left unknown... we don't get a good sense of who he is, and why... This movie could of been better if it depicted Depp as someone more sad... and the kids fate (childhood to their suicides and accidental deaths in actual life) as a tragicomedy of life... the mothers as sad object and embodiment of instinctive affection and traditional society... a more kubrick version of this film with a tim burton orientation would of been better than the current ""i'm so sweet"" version.)(b) The message about imagination is conveyed with little fantasy... Most scenes are very earthly in a boring sense... Most shots are face oriented... thus dependent on facial gestures... while the general image quality is ordinary... The characters display simple emotions within a predictable cliché situation... The result is plain.(c) The message about belief is conveyed with strong reliance on the sickness and death of the mother... (We're supposed to swallow the message by the power of the tragedy of her situation... and the need to overcome it... ) The distinction between good and bad belief is unclear... And the importance of believing and imagining is only affirmed in a microcosmic way (in relation to the mother) and thus the message remains shallow in a broad scope... The movie shows little of what Depp achieves with imagination... we just see bits of his play... that tries to be cute and moralistic, but risks being just cheesy and preachy because they lack both sophistication of words and craftiness of composition. And the movie shows little of what anyone else achieves with imagination.Imo, ""Finding Neverland"" stinks.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Would you say that J.M. Barrie was rebelling against England's stuffy culture?,"Sir James Matthew Barrie (Johnny Depp) was surrounded by stuffy rich English people who had no use for imagination. As he got involved with Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her sons, he began to imagine them flying and fighting pirates, and thus got the idea to write ""Peter Pan"".Usually, fantasies are kind of boring, but they did a really good job with it here. More than feel-good treacle, we get to see how Barrie became disenchanted with England's stuffy culture and was inspired to write ""Peter Pan"". The fact that Johnny Depp did a very good job with a Scottish accent only strengthens the movie. Interesting support also comes from Julie Christie as Sylvia's mother Emma du Maurier, and Dustin Hoffman as James' friend Charles Frohman.All in all, this is what fantasy should be. Splendid.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A beautiful and moving adaptation,"I have never been a fan of Johnny Depp, but he plays JM Barrie beautifully in this charming adaptation about the writing of Peter Pan. This film shows how the book and play were created and the inspiration behind the characters. The children are played wonderfully especially the little boy who plays Peter and is to be staring along side Depp in the new adaptation of Charlie and The Chocolate factory as Charlie. Kate Winslet also is very natural and movingly plays the mother of the children and the inspiration of Wendy. All in all this film is naturally and magically filmed, leading to a magnificently moving ending .",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Be it for a few seconds,"I am sure that children loved this movie, therefore we should do too. As anything that children would laugh or cry about makes hearts melt. I've been transported again to a place where I learned that childhood is never far away, as long as you remember doing it. It is so unbelievably easy to become a child again. Be it for just an hour and a half. Be it for just a few minutes, as it seemed.... I loved Johnny Depp and I loved the little Peter. As both of them live a bit in each and every one of us. We just don't seem to always remember it. Be it for a few seconds, we should all think of a world of Peters. Peter Pans.",,Anonymous,Biography
A lot like Big Fish,"This film is pretty good. It has a similar kind of feel and style to it as the Tim Burton film Big Fish. To be honest I thought Big Fish was a better film. It does tend to really try and pull at your heart strings a lot, especially towards the end. It just depends if you want to go see a movie and leave feeling thoroughly depressed as to whether you like this film. The girl who I was with cried a river, I had to use a boat to get out of the movie theatre. One thing I will say is that Johnny Depp did an excellent Scottish accent - probably the best that I know of. No doubt this film will win quite a lot of awards, but does anyone understand how academy awards are calculated? Its not always the best film that wins. I tend to not like movies that are quite so emotional. There is already enough sadness in the world, so the only reason to go see a movie is to watch a good comedy, because then at least you can laugh. My recommendation is to see it if you are already in a bad mood, because this will go well with it. I give it 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Full of Humanity,"In a word this movie was stunning. Bravo to all involved. This is truly one of Johnny Depp's finest performances but alas I think that as he has not already won an Oscar he will not win one again (I'm sure he does not care though, even if many of us think it is / will be a crime.) Kate Winslet follows Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind with this and shows her versatility again, an actress at the very top of her game. Also the young boy Peter was amazing. I don't have much more to say, just see this movie and don't be put off by the slightly slow start, believe me it doesn't take long before you are hooked. Go out and rent or buy the DVD when it becomes available unless it is still at theaters then go see it with a crowd. I guarantee few of you will find it less than almost magical. This movie reminds us of what it is like to feel your soul.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Well Done,"Finding Neverland is not a great movie. It's not a bad movie either. Good performances, art direction, and screenplay is still not enough to sum up to ""a great movie."" The movie focuses on the life of J.M. Barrie, during the time of writing the famous play, Peter Pan. What inspired him to write such a wonderful story is a mother and her four children. J.M. Barrie tells the children to believe in magic, and that magic does exist. He and the children play many fantasy games together as the mother joyfully watches. J.M. Barrie starts to develop a strong relationship with this family; the story added with a lonely wife, a disapproving mother, and the play manager. A little bit on the cheesy side, I'm sure there will be plenty of audiences who will enjoy this movie.Johnny Depp, Julie Christie, Kate Winslet, Dustin Hoffman, Freddie Highmore and Radha Mitchell all star in this movie, all giving fine performances. Finding Neverland could have been a little bit better.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A most beautiful film!,"I watched this film and I totally got blown away by it. Johnny Depp is most convincing in this tale of true imagination! I am a fond reader of the wonderful story of Peter Pan and I truly adore the movies that express the imagination of the marvellous writer J.M Barrie.When I found out they was making this film, I knew instantly I had to see it. 1: Because I love J.M Barrie and 2: Because I love peter pan! I love the story of a young boy never growing up and I love that it was an adult who thought up the idea. It was beautiful, the first time I read the Peter Pan novel, I cried. I cried because I finished it. Peter came back to see Wendy and she had grown, she didn't keep to her promise, but you know after finishing this book, she is still a child.I think this film portrays the life of Mr J.M Barrie perfectly, the way he walks into the door and he walks into a imaginary world and his wife walks into a normal room. It was beautiful. It took me ages to cry, but when I thought the time was wright, I cried, this film is so emotionally moving, that it will moving any grown man to tears, and it will change any adults view of the world.We all have an imagination, we should use it, I use mine.

mildly entertaining,"Let me begin by saying that I love period pieces, I love fantasies, and I love both Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet. This seemed like a role made for Depp, - ala Benny and Joon, Pirates of the Caribbean- and Winslet, - ala Sense and Sensibility, Titanic, etc. It's just too bad they had no chemistry in this film... In fact, intentional or not, there was little chemistry between anyone except occasionally Depp the children. I found the children's performances rather stiff and, aside from a few scenes, unconvincing. I was not terribly impressed by the storyline which fails to mine the relationships between Sir James Matthew Barry and Sylvia Lewell Davies or his wife, Mary Barrie. Dustin Hoffman was solid as usual - but again, we get too little of him and it's never clear why his character is prepared to continue to back Barry's plays. Although it's cinematography is lovely, I was very disappointed with this film. The story had immense potential, and who could fail with Depp, Winslet and Hoffman? Too bad that despite all it had going for it,it just didn't make the grade. I honestly can't give it more than 6 or 6.5...",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Imagine the possibilities,"Ended up going to see this movie on a whim. I had no expectations, and found it to be inspirational. It seems like most living in this commercial driven society are used to structure; they are used to living the way society ""expects"" them to live. This movie, more so than revealing the story of how ""Peter Pan"" came to be, reveals a message for the need to never lose your imagination - it is what allows us to create our opportunities rather than choose among those created for us. Not sure that I'm onto anything either, but at the age of 24 I feel that this story also attempts to make the point that the only truth is love - that you can't know it - you can only feel it. Hence, you can't be afraid to feel; yeah sometimes the truth hurts, but fear is even more hurtful.......and so my life's (up to now) philosophy is told, but in a beautiful way, visually.

Sweets to the sweet,"Over all this movie (Finding Neverland) is able to plod along slowly and carefully tell the main story of the Life of JM Barrie with all the ins and outs of how he developed the idea for the Peter Pan story.I found this movie (and the music) slow and too saccharine and thought it lacked some sort of vigor that I have come to expect from Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet's movies.Altho I really loved Kate Winslet's acting in this movie but I felt she was held back by the director and the script. Depp's acting was rather stilted and reserved for the whole film also. But I guess that was the director's choice- to give a stilted portrayal of the way snobby middle-class people were in Scotland (and all over) in those days. Now Scotish football fans are loud & vocal about their sport. So at least some things have changed.Overall, the children were wonderful but I found the boy Peter (Freddie Highmore) was dull and uninspiring and I found close-ups of his eyes that looked like pudgy blobs disquietingly flaccid. The other boys were lively but not seen enough of.In real-life, (as in the movie too) the Kate Winslet character (Sylvia) gets sick and Barrie (1860-1937) puts his hand up for the Guardianship of the Davies children. Later in life, Michael drowned at 21. The boy Peter grew up but he committed suicide in 1960. Barrie wrote the wonderful plays 'Quality Street' and 'The Admirable Crichton', which were great successes.This movie was much better than the JM Barrie story with Robin Williams (Hook 1991) which was over done and too long. The way this film showed the 'fantasy' scenes of Tinkerbell and the Pirate Gang were done SO well that I hope they decide to make a full length movie in this style and really bring Barrie's dreams to life.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Johnny Depp is in a class by himself,"I saw all of the candidates for the Oscar, and still feel that Johnny Depp and ""Finding Neverland"" should have won in the Best Actor and Best Film categories. Depp is probably the most talented and versatile actor in the world today, and the movie was terrific -- a wonderful addition to his brilliant portfolio. He is truly in a class by himself.Also, anyone commenting on this film cannot ignore excellent performances by Kate Winslet, Freddie Highmore, Dustin Hoffman, Radha Mitchell, Julie Christie and others in the ensemble cast -- who have brought magic back to the silver screen where it has been lacking far too long. This film is apt to be considered a classic in the years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The film for all that can still find ""child"" in themselves","As I found out that Jan A.P. Kaczmarek got the Oscar for the music in this film, I went to see it. As a matter of fact, I partly ignored the content being predominantly interested in the music combined with scenes. However, when I saw Marc Forster's FINDING NEVERLAND a few weeks ago, I was touched into tears by the movie in general.The whole story is very touching. The playwright, James Matthew Barrie (1860-1937), though an adult, has a soul of a child (played memorably by Johnny Depp). He writes a play PETER PAN and finds inspiration for this in family Llewelyn Davies and his relationship with children Davies(consider the moment of their first meeting and James dancing with a ""bear"", not ""just a dog""). He sacrifices most of his time for these children, including the most memorable Peter (Freddie Highmore) who is going to play the major role in Barrie's PETER PAN. A widowed mother, Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet), gets used to the magical world that James brought to their house. The play occurs to be a huge success... however, the mother slowly dies away...The moving moments are particularly powerful in this movie. The most memorable of them, for me, personally, were:orphans coming to the theater to see PETER PAN. In the beginning, the people there seem to be annoyed, but later... the theater turns into a harmoniously joyful place for all.the final moment and James talking with small Peter. How he consoles the boy is particularly touching: ""She is always with us, she is on every page of your imagination..."" And isn't everything so simpler when we believe?The cast give great performances, from Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet to the children, particularly Freddie Highmore as Peter. Fans of Dustin Hoffman will also have a chance to admire him in several scenes in the role of Charles Frohman.The music by A.P Kaczmarek is very profound at multiple levels. If you like ambitious music in films, you will realize that here, it is in perfect harmony with every single scene. Great experience!In sum, I will put it like this: FINDING NEVERLAND is not an average nice film, but it reveals one's attitude towards life and reality. It's a film about being different, about dreams that can be fulfilled ONLY if you believe.Skeptical people will probably find it strange; realists will treat it as a nice fairy tale for kids; materialists will see no benefit in what the movie shows, particularly in what james does. Yet, all people who perceive the world through heart and their dreams through imagination and faith will absolutely love it. Only such viewers will find a reflection of their character in James, who, to the contrary of the world's trust in reason, has never lost the goal of achieving ... the ""neverland"".",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not a bad tearjerker, but not great either","Yes, I blubbed at the end of Finding Neverland. It played the minor chords on my heartstrings effectively enough, but the film suffers from a slight lack of momentum, largely because of the performances of Johnny Depp and Dustin Hoffman.Hoffman, a dandyish figure with a mid-Atlantic accent, is a puzzling comic-relief character whose screen presence is distracting rather than engaging. I found myself thinking, whenever he appeared, ""It's Dustin Hoffman! What's he doing here? And is he supposed to be American or British?"" To be fair to Hoffman, it is possible that his accent was a perfect rendition of what Americans sounded like in J. M. Barrie's time, but he never seems comfortable in the role.And Depp is just a bit wooden. Again, perhaps he is meant to be restrained - the film is set in Victorian Britain after all. But Depp's soft Scottish tones and phlegmatic response to any event, no matter how dramatic, makes the film a little flat. If someone had run in and shouted ""Run for your lives, the house is on fire"" you feel that Depp would have looked pensive and cooed ""Ooh, dear. We'll have to put it out, then."" It doesn't help that the central drama - a main character's disease - is telegraphed so far in advance that you can't believe it is a surprise to anyone when it makes its grand entrance. Still, Kate Winslet is excellent as ever in her English rose role and the children are very good indeed.If you are fond of a weepie, Finding Neverland will not let you down. But compared to other films ranked in the Internet Movie Database's top 250 it is decidedly weak.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Truly, a moving cinematic experience.","I went in to this film with high expectations, which is usually dangerous. I fall prey to this action quite often, and have found that movies that transcend this predetermined experience are remarkable. Finding Neverland is no exception.This movie is well cast, well written, and well acted. The cinematography shines above all. The foreshadowing is exquisite in that most, if not all viewers, do already know, at least, the story of Peter Pan. So the experience is not empty. When little details of what went into the play show their faces throughout the first half of the movie, every viewer feels like they're one up on the characters on the screen. But, the viewer also understands each portions of the plays relevance to what is being experienced in the film. It's a learning experience in both directions.But, the heartfelt sentiment of this one man's love for this unfortunate family is ever-present.I am a man who has no problem admitting that a film brought tears to my eyes. So, this film brought tears to my eyes. Tears of happiness and sadness at the same time.

Minority opinion,"Finding Neverland (2004), directed by Marc Forster, has received high scores and rave reviews on IMDb. This review represents a minority opinion. I found the movie shallow, the acting mediocre, and the ending obvious.The one strong aspect of the film has been noted by an earlier reviewer--it allows a glimpse into the mind of a creative artist. JM Barrie takes bits and pieces from real life, and turns them into Peter Pan. Interesting, but let's remember that what he created wasn't exactly King Lear.Johnny Depp has great cheekbones, Kate Winslet suffers beautifully, and Julie Christie demonstrates that true beauty is independent of age. Dustin Hoffman, as Barrie's long-suffering producer, was the only actor for whom I would have wished more screen time. The child actors were adequate, but then so was the dog.I think this movie is too mature for children, too childish for adults, and not right for anyone.

A remarkably moving story,"Fellow Movie Afficionados, I walked into the movie theatre: 1) to see two of the best actors of my generation (Depp & Winslet), 2) not having any background on JM Barrie, 3) not really even knowing the story of Peter Pan, and 4) not really ""believing in Neverland."" This protocol (seeking out films with good acting regardless of the storyline) has served me well in the past; I'm sure I am not alone in saying that there are occasions in which I am driven by a film to read the book or more upon which it is based. Although I later found that certain artistic and factual ""liberties"" were taken to tell this version of the story of ""Neverland"", I am not disappointed. This is a telling that brings to the foreground the universal truths and feelings that become more warm and hued -- if sometimes difficult to accept -- as one grows older. Johnny Depp is exceptional in turning in an appropriately subtle, moving performance as a man who can't be who his wife, theatrical agent, and other adults want or expect him to be. At least not until he meets a young widow (Winslet, in a poignant turn) and her sons, who adore and accept him just the way he is. I will not further elaborate on the plot; instead, I offer that, for those of you who are,like me, sentimental ""fools"" who spend most of their work-week as ""human-doings"" in an effort to project a hard-bitten corporate visage that may serve us well on the promotion ladder but does little to improve us as human-beings. . .this is definitely a DVD to buy for the Sunday afternoons in which you can take a private break from the rat-race, and believe once more that ""whatever lies ahead is nothing compared to what lies within.""",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Oops...where did you put neverland,"J.M. Barrie is one those people whose books reflected both realities and fantasies in their normal life. So his life has been much analysed. The creator of superman is getting the same treatment now.For those who has seen only the Disney version of Peter Pan then you probably don't really understand the true depth of the story and it is worth seeing the newer version of Peter Pan released in 2003.This is the story of how life, death, children, and other things around J.M. Barrie inspired his work. Like Shakespeare in Love this movie will help you get some insight into the mind of a great man, but it is far from historically accurate.Other Peter Pan stories (not just the famous play) say Peter fighting against the boring stuffiness of upper middle class British society.Here, Hollywood of course adds for to much sugar and makes it much more positive than the reality, while adding music to underline the tragedy.While it is comfortable with the topic of death it fails to address the sexual issues in the play. J.M. Barrie is said to have never really grown up, and may not have been capable of having sex. Peter Pan reflects his sadness as those around him change from children to adults while he stays forever a child.OK, getting over the fact that I have read a lot on the life of J.M Barrie it is still an entertaining movie about the creation of art. I am not sure whether to say watch Peter Pan first and then this movie or the other way around, either way would provide a portion of enlightenment (one viewing of this movie will provide the total of your recommended daily intake of enlightenment).I think this movie lacked the courage to take us to harsh reality of neverland. For in Peter Pan, Neverland is wonderful and fantastic, but contains dangers and perils, with fears of death and sex. That was not present in this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

In my opinion the Depp just could not handle his role. The interaction between the ladies is a story full of drama and a good reflection of motivations in society. And they seem to understand it and play wonderfully. The boys are acting okay, not very good, not very bad. Why writing about actors not the story?

Forgetting Neverland,"This film is probably worse than average Hollywood film. It is on the surface and to the core formulaic movie-making. The editing is sloppy, the characters and story mere thinly veiled clichés, the space of the movie is constricted. Johnny Depp fails to excite imagination, interest, or much more than a yawn or wince. Kate Winslet does not outdo her co-star. The language and etiquette of 1901 is completely ignored, in a way that makes it seem as if a modern story were happening in old costumes. I was especially disturbed by the fact that the film has garnered such high evaluations among critics and film-goers alike. It is nevertheless worthless, a waste of time. Your imagination deserves much more than this film can hope to inspire. I can only assume the makers of this movie were taking the advice of ""believing"" to heart, and thought that if they ""believed"" this atrocious mess were successful, then it would be. Of course it takes an audience believing against all belief to make a film like this ""fly.""",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just believe!,"Sir James Barrie was a man who refused to grow up. In doing so, he lived in a Neverland world where children had a prominent place. Mr. Barrie thought the world belong to children.Marc Forster has brilliantly succeeded in showing us Sir James Barrie, whose ideas were ahead of the times in which he lived. He plays homage to the legacy this man left behind, namely, ""Peter Pan"", the eternal hopeful story of what's good in mankind and how children will always know better that believing and hoping are the best ways to counter attack the cynicism around them.The casting of Johnny Depp as Sir James, is one of the most felicitous details this movie has going for itself. Not only does Mr. Depp is a natural actor who shines in everything he does, but he goes under the skin of the writer and makes us think we are watching the man himself. Mr. Depp is at his best.Equally brilliant is Kate Winslet. She is Sylvia Llewelyn Davis, the mother of the four boys that befriend Sir James in the park. She sees in him a surrogate father since the real one has died. Evidently the facts have been changed somehow by the authors of the play and the screen treatment because supposedly the real father was alive and well at the time they met Mr. Barrie. Ms. Winslet is charming as Sylvia. This actress conveys the idea of the love of her children and loyalty for the man that came to become a friend and a platonic admirer.Julie Christie plays Sylvia's mother, Emma du Maurier, the bourgeois woman who resents the friendship between her daughter and Sir James. Ms. Christie has not had a big part in films recently and she does wonders to make Mrs. du Maurier to be the hateful person she is, until the end, when she realizes she had been wrong about Sir James all along.Radha Mitchell appears as Mary Barrie, the woman who was against the involvement between her husband and Sylvia. She is a complicated woman who will condemn her man before he is proved guilty. Ms. Mitchell is excellent also in everything she does, although she has little to do in here. Freddie Highmore is Peter, the young man who inspired the character of ""Peter Pan"" and he is wonderful as the confused young man until he is asked to believe by the man who was like a father to him and his brothers.A delightful time at the cinema for those young at heart!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
a fairy dream...,"If you enjoy something different this movie is for you, if your not into the drama category this movie is still for you. It feels like its for everyone, it gives you a touch of joy, a touch of sadness but most of all... you believe... :)The performance of Mr Depp and Ms Winslet is absolutely astonishing, they both contribute so much to this movie and i had a hard time finding myself not believing their characters. Whole picture just grabbed me and a big kudos to the casting, the director, the cut and soundtrack was a bullseye.What is really remarkable by this film is that in all its magic i couldn't care less if it was fiction or not.

"An enjoyable film, but its sense of wonder undermines its status as a real and emotionally involving story","With yet another disappointing play under his belt, JM Barrie is understandably down, and a cold and distant relationship with his wife doesn't help simulate his creative juices. Writing in the local park as he does, Barrie meets widow Sylvia Llewelyn-Davies and her four sons. Enjoying his day with the children, Barrie gets to know Sylvia and become her friend; however the social circle that Barrie moves in looks down on such relationships and the whole thing further damages his marriage. However it is in his friendship and imaginative playing that Barrie finds his inspiration and begins writing what will turn out to be his most successful and memorable play.On the basis of a five star review from Empire Magazine and the presence of the ever worth a risk Johnny Depp, I came to this film without a great love of Peter Pan or Barrie and it was more the appeal of the actor that drew me more than it was the man Barrie. Maybe it is for this reason that I enjoyed the film but was not totally won over by it in the same way as many other viewers seem to have been; maybe it is because I didn't approach the film filled with the sense of wonder that the film drops on us and, although I recognise how important it was to the film, I couldn't help feeling that it also took away from the reality of the story at the same time. The plot was interesting but I was more interested in the real side of the story that I was in the flights of imaginative fancy that it regularly heads off on. I enjoyed these scenes as well but they only had value beyond adding a sense of wonder to the film and to the story whereas I felt the film gave short change to the actual reality of the story  especially the scandal around Barrie and Sylvia's friendship and the decay of Barrie's marriage.In a way is that the film wanted to be too full of wonder and shy away from the darker stuff that made it lose some of its impact and appeal to me. It seemed that either issues were simplified or they were simply resolved (or lessened) by Barrie's insistence that things could be solved by just going into your imagination and so on. However this does the alleged darker side of the story a disservice because, although we hear of the chatter of paedophilia (a claim the boys have always totally denied) the story tends to make things like Barrie's marriage break-up and so on easier to swallow by encouraging us to see his marriage as already at an end (and we are encourage to blame his wife) and also to look more to the wonder he brought that the harm that we know he was actually causing to the Llewelyn-Davies family. Of course to bring these out would have damaged the sense of wonder the rest of the film encourages us to buy into and would have made this a different and less sweet affair, but would have been more interesting to me.If anything it wants to be too 'nice' and full of wonder  and real life is rarely that way or that morally simple.Of course many people will not have come to this film for Barrie but for Depp and they will not be disappointed because, moral simplicity aside, Depp gives an assured performance the likes of which we have come to expect from him over the course of his career. The Scottish accent is pretty good although quite soft and therefore kept accessible to the American market. He does well with both the imagined stuff but also with the difficult emotional stuff  Depp managing to put in the complexity that really the script should have helped him with more. Winslet is OK but rather simplistic and too easily sweet and played in contrast with her mother and Barrie's wife. She is a good actress here but didn't have much to really work with. Therefore Christie and Mitchell are not as good as they should have been  certainly Mitchell was done a great disservice as the film simply had no time for her pain or longing to have been involved in her husband's world in the same way as Davies was. Highmore was impressive and he is the main person to keep the film in reality with his outburst of pain; he too falls in with the wonder by the end but at times his pain and confusion is very engaging and refreshingly convincing and real. Hoffman was a strange find but he is a welcome addition  his distinctive presence complimented by a handful of amusing lines that more than cover for the fact that he does seem a little out of place in turn of the century England! People like Ian Hart and Paul Whitehouse barely make an impression but it is nice to see them anyway.Overall this is a good film but in a way the sense of wonder that many people have praised was also one of its weaknesses. Instead of being a real story that showed the complex emotions of the situation (even the simplified situation seen here) the film tends to err on the side of wonder and shirks away from the difficult issues that would have left the audience unsure whether to really root for Barrie or not and instead enjoys itself on its flights of fancy. It still have enough emotion and wonder to make it an enjoyable film that is worth seeing but I couldn't help feeling that it really was going for easy targets and avoiding things that would make things more difficult for both it and its audience.",,Anonymous,Biography

Fall For It Hook Line and Tinkerbell,"The unmatchable Johnny Depp dons a Scottish accent for his role as legendary author JM Barrie in this charming tale of a man who never grew up.It is 1903 and JM Barrie has what can only be described as writers block, the ideas that have created his legend have evaporated and he is reliant on his distinguished name, until he meets the widowed Sylvia Lewelyn Davies (Kate Winslett) and her four young sons.Barrie soon becomes a fixture in their lives and helps to bring hope to the family who survive on the harshness of reality. Convincing the young and emotionally distraught Peter that dreams can become reality, despite the fact that he and the boys are aware of similarity between the illness their mother has and the illness that killed their father.But it is with the help of Lewelyn-Davies family that Barrie begins to pen his greatest, and most famous story, about a boy who never grew up, but tragedy is waiting around the corner and the story's happy ending is fraught with grief and turmoil",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Only Best Picture Contender That Is A Yawn,"Of the five nominated films for Best Picture this year, ""Finding Neverland"" is in our view the weakest of the lot. And in fact we would argue it should not have been nominated at all. ""Kill Bill 2"" or ""Hotel Rwanda"" would have been better choices. But why might ""Finding Neverland"" not meet our expectations?For one, this is a fairly boring tale. There is not one adult situation that hints of stress or personal conflict, or at least not in any normal human way. And we are beset with the New Age twist to how we should behave around kids; we hear an awful lot of ""quiet voices"" and as is customary in tales embracing the adoration of all things child-like children are afforded the powers of observation and acumen of adults.Prior knowledge of the Peter Pan story is requisite. And while that tale has most undoubtedly been treated well in many of our lifetimes, the background of how J. M. Barrie came to render the original story is less than compelling, really. That Barrie subsumed himself in a child-like fantasy world is amusing, but no more than that. ""Finding Neverland"" might be a far more interesting account of the principal's lives if it had been more true to real life and if we had been shown even a smidgen of chemistry between the real-life Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslet) and J. M. Barrie (Johnny Depp).Johnny Depp no doubt gives a seminar in acting, as he always does; he is one of our finest actors. In an interview (http://www.the-trades.com/column.php?columnid=2898) director Marc Forster describes Depp ""as a 'great creative collaborator'. 'The amazing thing is Johnny ultimately trusts the director,' Forster explains, 'and Johnny Depp trusting me is the highest compliment anyone could give me.'"" Nonetheless Depp's carefully nuanced performance is no better than Kevin Kline's own in ""De-Lovely"", and one could say they are even similar, with Kline getting the edge for the risks he takes and the passion he brings to the screen.Of the films nominated, these are the IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes ratings, respectively: Sideways (96%, 8.1/10), Million Dollar Baby (93%, 8.3/10), The Aviator (89%, 7.7/10), Finding Neverland (84%, 8.2/10) and Ray (82%, 7.9/10). In like manner, ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" checked in at 85%, 8.2/10 and ""Hotel Rwanda"" garnered scores of 90% and 8.5/10. We leave it to you to make the final determination, but ""Finding Neverland"" is exactly the type of film that will leave art film detractors delirious with delight; it is a yawn.Rating: Two and ¾ stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

I don't get it.,"We sat there waiting and waiting for a movie to entertain and it never did happen. We read the flowering reviews and had several friends give it their highest recommendations. We expected an incredible movie. We have graduate degrees. Are 45. Have five kids. High IQs. I acknowledge that from a technical standpoint the movie has merits. But when it was finished, we were glad. I am not sure I would even recommend renting the video when it comes out. The scene upon which the movie starts is the opening night of a play. The playwright--Johnny Depp--watches the audience from behind the curtains as they drift off into boredom. Soon, the rain outside the set begins to pour onto and drence the audience, presumably symbolizing the failure of the play to entertain. Frankly, this scene is prophetic of the movie overall.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
A rare film of beauty. *Many spoilers*,"Finding Neverland is easily one of the best pictures of recent years, and certainly the best of its type.The movie's greatest achievement is that it either forgoes the standard clichés or uses them very subtly. First is the humour. Films of this type often go overboard, but not this one, it doesn't go for cheap (Or cute) humour. It does have humorous parts, but they are few and it did not put them in at the expense of the plot.It also is above going for cheap emotions, it earns its sadness and it's happiness, it doesn't go for cheap manufactured Hallmark card sadness or cotton-candy happiness.At one point it dawns on Barrie to invite 25 children, mostly orphans, to the opening of his play. On the outside this seems like something from Patch Adams, but the movie ignores the standard clichés, and this doesn't seem manufactured.Another cliché they ignored was the standard ""You're not my father."" Scene which is inevitable in any movie with children without a father. While pretending to be Indians, Barrie does call Peter his son, and Peter does stop pretending and he does tell Barrie, ""You're not my father."" And run off, but that's the only time you see it. The film never brings it up again because it's quite clear Barrie doesn't want to be the children's father.Child actors are usually hit or miss, but the children in this film were excellent. There are times in which the boy who plays Peter even outshines Johnny Depp.During a play Peter wrote for his mother and Barrie, the mother goes into a fit of coughing and the doctor has to be called, Peter runs outside and starts demolishing the set. Barrie tells the boy that his mother claims that it's only a chest cold and that she'll be okay. But Peter went through this with his father already and tells Berrie, ""I will not be a made a fool of!"" He then recounts how is mother told him his father was going to take the family fishing in a few weeks, and how his father then died the very next night.The film manages to seamlessly integrate reality and fantasy. When Barrie and the children play, it switches back and forth between reality and fantasy, one moment the children are standing against a tree and Barrie is dressed as a pirate, the next they are tied to a ship on the sea and he's cutting them loose in exchange for them agreeing to be pirates. This manages to be more believable than Robin Williams filling a tank with spaghetti, because they don't ask you to suspend your disbelief, they tell you that it's just make-believe.But the movie is anything but a fantasy, it's most likely the most realistic of its kind because it gives you a realistic ending, not manufactured, and not something you see in major movies anymore.The saddest scene comes when the mother is close to dying, she tells Berrie that she would once like him to take her to Neverland, so the next time he sees her when she is very sick, he brings the actors from his play to the house and they recreate the play in the house. The walls open up and Neverland is revealed, people are flying, there is Captain Hook, the alligator, mermaids, fairies. The mother walks out into Neverland in a flowing gown. It's an incredibly sad scene, but it's also happy. My first thought was that this was the ending, and even though it was unrealistic, I would have had no problems with it ending right there. But it isn't the ending, the movie flashes forward to the mother's funeral. Peter runs off, Barrie follows, he finds Peter sitting on a bench, they talk about his mother. Barrie tells him that his mother isn't gone if he believes he's there. You see Barrie and Peter together on the bench, and they start to fade transparent. The ending was one of the most beautiful I've seen, no happy ending, no sad ending, just an ending, a perfect ending, an ending that you rarely in mainstream modern films.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

I'm looking forward to see what the director does with the next Bond movie. Johnny Depp was OK, but far from great. The storyline is interesting enough, could have more drama and challenges for the protagonist, though. Also the character development could be deeper with all characters.

Great Biographical Drama,"Finding Neverland Miramax FilmsDirector: Marc ForsterGenre's: Biographical DramaStarring: Johnny Depp as Sir James Matthew Barrie, Kate Winslet as Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, Julie Christie as Mrs. Emma du Maurier, Dustin Hoffman as Charles Froman, Nick Roud as George Llewelyn Davies, Joe Prospero as Jack Llewelyn Davies, Freddie Highmore as Peter Llewelyn Davies and Luke Spill as Michael Llewelyn Davies.Marc Forster directed this amazing cast of actors to tell the story of the evolution of the creation of Peter Pan, by the playwright James Matthew Barrie. Johnny Depp uses his magical powers as a chameleon to transform himself into the Scottish storyteller of the 1800s. ""Finding Neverland"" takes the viewer into the personal lives of the relationships that Berrie used to create the magical story of a boy who refused to grow up. These relationships although not acceptable for the time, would none the less survive and flourish as the widow Sylvia and her 4 sons, Michael, Peter, Jack and George, become enamored with the boyish playful nature of Barrie. This story shows that the hardships of life can have devastating effects on children, to the point where it can rob them of their childhood. When Barrie first meets the Llewelyn Davies family the young son Peter has become old beyond his years due to the loss of his father to cancer. Barrie uses his fascinating imagination and creativity to bring the children back to a more innocent happy time in their lives. After meeting Sylvia and her sons Barrie is faced with the lifeless marriage that has developed over the years within his own life. Barrie develops a deep love for Sylvia and her boys and is determined to lead the family to the peaceful place in his imagination ""Neverland."" ""Finding Neverland"" was reminiscent of the 1990 TV Movie, ""The Dreamer of OZ"" which chronicled the life of the famous author L. Frank Baum who created ""The Wizard of OZ."" Both stories gave the viewing audience a perspective on the power of imagination for these two gifted storytellers. Throughout the filming of ""Finding Neverland"" the cinematography was exceptional. Clear, crisp, colorful, on location filming was done to perfection. Scenes out of the imagination of Barrie were so bright and focused to the magic of his mind that the audience is taken right to the heart of ""Neverland"". I felt an immediate admiration for both the writer and the man Sir James Matthew Barrie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Heartwarming story,"I must have been confusing Finding Neverland with another movie, for I thought I'd surely seen this movie when it was released and hated it. Giving it a second viewing for Julie Christie's time as Star of the Week, it was very pleasant. Yes, there's some sadness (and depending on what's going on in your life, you might need to reach for a handkerchief), but all in all, it's a very entertaining, heartwarming story.Johnny Depp stars as the playwright who wrote ""Peter Pan"". He starts the film with a flop, his producer Dustin Hoffman (in an adorable casting choice, throwing back to 1991's Hook) a bit disappointed and his wife Radha Mitchell a bit embarrassed. Johnny isn't one who enjoys hobnobbing the way she does, and their marriage has become strained over the years. Before you think she's unreasonable, try to remember the time period. In the 1900s, keeping to one's class was important, and gossip could ruin someone's life. So, it's understandable that Radha doesn't want her name tarnished and all the doors in London to be closed to her because of her husband's childish behavior. He loves pretending, playing, and encouraging the imagination of kids. When he meets a widow and her four children in the park, he delights in their company. Pretty soon, he spends every afternoon with them, acting as a father figure to the boys and a savior to the damsel in distress. Of course Radha doesn't approve! Especially since the widow is Kate Winslet, and Johnny Depp has probably seen Titanic. Just kidding.Despite propriety, Johnny has a very endearing character and gives a solid performance as a normal person - something rare in his repertoire. It's hard to believe this is the same actor who dons disguises in Tim Burton movies. He's absolutely fine when he's normal; it's a shame he got typecast as the opposite. In Finding Neverland, although he's playful, he's not manic. He's just able to reach children at their level, because he realizes how fleeting childhood is.If you haven't seen this one, or you thought you had but didn't really remember it, consider renting it on a wintery afternoon. The costumes are beautiful, and it's interesting to find out how the story of ""Peter Pan"" was created. I also like how the screenwriter gives the ""bad guys"" three-dimensional characters. Like Radha, Julie Christie (Kate's mother) is concerned with societal judgment. If a married man appears to stake his claim with her daughter and grandchildren, it will mark them and ruin any other chances Kate might have in the future of marrying again and securing financial security for her family. Although tempting, it's not always sensible to follow one's heart - as Kate herself learned in 1995's Sense in Sensibility. Just kidding.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Johnny Depp dances with the bear, the camera goes in circles for a minute. Also, during the performance, the camera ""flies"" out into the audience with Tinkerbell with lots of loops and swerves, and that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Neverland has never been made,"I think Finding Neverland is one of the best movies of our times. Not only because it has a great cast. But it is also believable (and it should, because it is based on the real thing. It has all aspects in it that we people please. All kinds of emotions we like. We like to laugh, it's good to cry, we like drama we like childhood, it's all in there and more. It is one of those movies that don't really exist anymore these days. It's not a movie with sex for once, it is not a commercial movie. It has love in it though. This movie is so pure and innocent; it touches the soul! And above all, I think it is inspiring. It shows that we are all children still, and in this society people want to grow up so soon, and they think using fantasy is childish. Well my opinion is that using your fantasy is a fantastic thing. It makes you happy when you are sad, it makes you laugh when you feel like you want to cry. I believe that people who use there fantasy more are happier people. And those kind of people can achieve more, because they are more open for other ideas, and they can see things from different (unrealistic) point of views.To make a long story short; Finding Neverland is an inspiration for young and old. And one of those movies you wouldn't forget. I think it's one of the best movie of our times!With love, Carlijn Woudstra From Holland",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

You can go anywhere that your imagination will let you...,"... and if the will is strong enough; the destiny that you create for yourself will win through.

If you're receptive to enchantment, your belief can take you anywhere...Fine acting all around; but in a nice change, it was the ladies who held the most grace, for me. Maybe it's because most of the boys were ALREADY in touch with their 'inner child - it was a joy to see the women connect in that way, eventually, too.There are certain adult associates of Barrie's throughout the film who would doubtless give their eye-teeth to be able to get inside his head.

Finding the Power of Imagination through the Schmaltz,"With just a bit of reining in the schmaltz ""Finding Neverland"" could have gone beyond a very good movie to an excellent film.The film is at its best when, like ""Topsy Turvy,"" it shows how an artist creates a beloved masterwork. Grounding the story in the theater helps us enter into James Barrie's head very effectively, such that it's just a small step for us to join him into the Imagi-Nation (as Kris Kringle called it in ""Miracle on 34th Street"").It is much more convincing than ""Big Fish"" in showing us the power of the storyteller because it is related more to the joys of the child in all of us rather than the avoidance of maturity, though that's how other adult characters chide Barrie. I presume it is intentional that Barrie's real life seems so drab compared to his fantasies, but it is a bit stiff to watch.The child actors are at their best when they are not miniature Edwardian adults but are rambunctious brothers like the no-necked monsters in ""Desperate Housewives."" It's a relief to see in film that not all upper class Britons were banished to strict boarding schools. While mildly dealing with rumors about the nature of Barrie's relationship with the mother and her children, David Magee's script is weakened when he has the younger boys talk preternaturally like adults, especially when it is solely for tear jerking effect. The oldest brother's gradual acceptance of adult responsibility is convincing, but Peter is just a shade short of annoying.The biggest weakness in the film is the maudlin handling of the illness of Kate Winslet's character, which is as old-fashioned a decorous cinematic portrayal of consumption as Greta Garbo in ""Camille."" Could she not have at least been made up to look less radiantly healthy or did she only have Terminal Movie Starness?Julie Christie and Radha Mitchell have thankless, one-dimensional roles, but make the most of what they're given to work with and only the former gets to prove she believes in fairies.",,Anonymous,Biography

It brings joy and sadness, laughter and tears and when I left the cinemas, the audience was in complete silence totally speechless.This film was completely not what I was expecting, I didn't think it was affect my feelings of love and imagination and so it touched me so deeply. Johnny Depp like usual did a brilliant performance and It is rumored there is a Oscar buzz for best actor. But Johnny not alone. The whole cast did a great performance, The child stars are constantly praised for their acting which I proudly praise along with them, Kate Winslet and Dustin Hoffman are also getting a Oscar buzz for best supporting actress and actor, Freddie Highmore (one of the children) was offered a big role in the Upcoming Charlie and the chocolate factory as Charlie Bucket due to his acting skills. But how could we forget the film itself getting a best picture buzz too. I world seems to be loving this film and I too love this film and only anticipate so dearly for this to come on DVD soon.Now the Story may not be completely true yet it is as beautiful as it could ever possibly be, I highly recommend this film. This film is a PG, but just because it is a PG, don't think it's just a kids film, but a film for the whole family. But after watching this film you probably believe it is a kids film because it's for kids young and old it doesn't mater if you are 2 or 102 we are all kids inside really.reviewed by Catty (owner of www.displayingdepp.tk)",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A moving film; that moves slowly,"Sometimes it is best I guess not to go into a film with such high expectations. Such it was when I ventured into ""Finding Neverland"". I expected a lot. On the plus side, all of the acting by the main characters was solid. The cinematography was also fine. The letdown was in the story itself. It simply moved along too slowly. Johnny Depp's persona reminded me of Jim Carrey in ""The Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind."" A rather silent character that always seems to be quietly thinking about something, though what it is we are not too sure. Although Depp's performance is convincing, I feel it needs to be more verbal and expressive. Freddie Highmore is excellent, but his part seems too small in the overall story. Children would probably fall asleep watching ""Finding Neverland"". For adults, however, the slow pace is at least offset by a fine visual expression and the ordeal of the characters in the midst of tragedy, not to mention the creation of Neverland itself. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Awesome movie,"An awesome movie. Depp's performance is breathtaking. Depp truly deserves an Oscar for this magnificent picture in which he shows us once again, that he is one of todays best. He is versatile, gifted and subtle. With movies like ""Blow"" and ""Pirates of the Caribean"" and now ""Finding Neverland"" he showed us once and for all that he can play any role perfectly. Winslet, Mitchel and Hoffman are also awesome, and make this movie a magnificent work of art. This movie is definitely one of the best movies of 2004. The story is powerful, believable and touching.

Not true to life,"Finding Neverland is an interesting film, Johnny Depp does a credible job in playing J.M. Barrie, his 'lost boy' interpretation is most apt and pleasing. However only in a few small places is the film true to life, to start with the FIVE Llewelyn Davies boys' father Arthur was alive when Barrie first came into their life and when Peter Pan was first performed. Peter Pan was first performed in 1904, Arthur died in 1907, Sylvia died in 1910 and the book Peter and Wendy was published in 1911.The film is very well done, however, do not be fooled this is not the story of J.M.Barrie, read Andrew Birkin's biography for a slightly better idea of the real Barrie.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Finding Neverland close to being a perfect movie.,"This film uses a fantastic blend of imagination and realism in order to tell a touching story. It uses many different devices to drive the viewers to a multitude of emotions. There's just the right amount of everything in here, the use of comedy and tragedy as well as a main character who you want to watch and learn more about, it just keeps you watching the screen until the credits roll. While I did have some problems with Johnny Depp's accent in the film, it bothered me less and less as it went on, because it wasn't as distracting as other accent fouls. With beautiful visuals and the occasional touch of humor, it's one of the best motion pictures of 2004.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A schmaltzy whitewash,"Anybody who knows any details about the real-life J.M. Barrie andthe five (not four) Llewellyn-Davies boys will be grossed out by thisblob of Lyle's Golden Syrup. I love Johnny Depp, but why cast himas a (supposed to be) wizened middle-aged eccentric Scotsman?Why gloss over Barrie's twisted obsession with these boys? Whyhave their father already dead? Why make Mary Barrie into a venal,frigid socialite? She was an artist and a dog lover who left herhusband because he didn't want to have sex with her and give hera child...he'd rather co-opt somebody else's kids. Why make up allthis stuff? (Why make a movie out of a play that committed thesecrimes?) The true story is much more gripping. I don't know who's going towatch this. Those interested in literary history will be repelled; allthe fairy dust in the world can't keep this scow aloft.",,Anonymous,Biography
a story that doesn't need telling,"I give this picture a seven but it's success depends entirely on Johnny Depp's performance. The story itself is not intrinsically interesting and the supporting cast does a good workmanlike job but nothing stellar. Direction is fine. The real problem is this is a story that does not really bear telling, let alone deserve a feature motion picture with a talented cast. It is a fine effort wasted on a story unworthy of it.Johnny Depp, I think, has now demonstrated he is one of the best young talents in Hollywood. Certainly he is the best young male actor. He achieved something few actors do well: he mastered a foreign accent and kept it consistently throughout the picture. And he was able to do it with evocative emotion. Only Meryl Streep is another actor who can do this.Think this is a small accomplishment? Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman failed to do it with a Southern accent in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"". Tom Hanks failed with a Boston Braham accent in ""Volunteers"". Maureen O'Hara failed with an Irish accent in ""The Quiet Man"". And these are all talented actors.Still, I think the story itself, basically how the author of ""Peter Pan"" gets his inspiration for this tale, is too small and mundane a story for the screen. Others have disagreed and rate this picture highly.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An amazing way to revisit your childhood,"It isn't very often that a movie makes you think about how much you are smiling during it. But that is exactly what this movie will do. The movie is about the author of the beloved story Peter Pan, but it is so much more than that. This movie is about believing. This is the type of movie that makes you want to go into the world and make it better somehow. A moving tale that has complex situations but will bring the viewers mind back to the simplicity of being a child. The simplicity of the knowledge that anything can be real if you just believe in it. This is a movie that dives into the mind of a creative genius as he searches for a way to reveal the world that he sees through a play. It is a movie that deals with relationships and what can happen if you open your heart up to people. It is a movie that will make you laugh and cry, but most importantly, it will make you smile.

Sweet without being Maudlin,"In a brilliantly apt performance, the eccentric Johnny Depp plays the equally eccentric writer Barrie, the creator of the now beloved Peter Pan stories. Following his early exploits in London, he strikes a sweet relationship with sickly Sylvia and her children, who engage in his wonderful fantasy world. The child actors deserve commendation here, as their performances are far more skilled (and bearable) than child actors in other films, filling their portrayals with the right amounts of emotional expression and subtlety. Far from being props to tug at our heartstrings, we fully invest in their characters and their heartfelt desire for their mother to get better. On the other side, we fully invest in Barrie and his heartfelt desire to connect with her and create something novel to lift her spirits. From this sweet yet poignant friendship comes the Peter Pan stories we all know and love.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Depp gives a magical performance,"Having seen Johnny Depp in all the endless Pirates films it was very nice to see him give a honed and effective portrayal of J.M Barrie in this strong film from 2004.Not only is it an interesting idea for a film but it also manages to not go for the obvious way of telling it. Depp shines in his role as Barrie and as an audience we go along with his actions, despite the fact that in a way he is cheating on his wife.Kate Winslet is also on top form in her role, with her chemistry with Depp and the boys that play her children feels genuine and this is one of the main strengths of the film.It's not the quickest film you'll ever see in terms of pace but that doesn't make the final moments any less touching or well written. With audiences being reintroduced to it through the new musical version I can only recommend you check out this quietly charming film.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Giving ""Finding Neverland""  a 10","Once again a Johnny Depp movie has sent me to the internet for research. He has hit the mark in his character portrayal of Barrie. The research shows. Depp's quiet unassuming manner never upstaging for the sake of upstaging. Actively engaging the other players. Each nuance delivered with ease and purpose. Each projected mental picture in the development of the Peter Pan story was a delightful process to watch. The setting and dress brought to light that which I only pictured in my mind.....the way I suppose it REALLY was....not typically Hollywood gussied up! The whole cast moved easily through the time period. Never seeming out of place. Perfect casting.My only disappointment was that our theater said it was not getting the movie. Guess word got around how good it was and protests went out. We are having a limited engagement! Glad I didn't miss it and was told about it through the grapevine.I could roll the credits here and say.....""each and every one of you did a job worthy of honors upon honors, awards upon awards"". Job well done!!! This movie only proves, once again, that a good movie doesn't need foul mouthed language, hot bedroom scenes, shoot 'em or blow 'em up to tell a story with meat.

A beautiful surprise,"What a truly remarkable film this is. It wouldn't have been my first choice of film, but my Gran had been given it for Christmas and I was asked to watch it with her. I like Johnny Depp as an actor; he really gets into character, and the same is true in this film. Truth be told, I did not even recognise him at the beginning of the film. At first I found myself thinking, ""This is not really my kind of film"", but as time went on, I became absorbed in the story. Freddie Highmore was excellent and having worked with Depp before, there was a strong relationship between them. These two performances were the ones that stood out the most for me, but all were excellent.I was touched by this film and am not ashamed to reveal that I was I tears by the end. This is a wonderfully directed film that encourages you to believe in your imagination; I wanted to cheer out loud when Silvia's mother was the first to start clapping in response to, ""if you believe in fairies, clap your hands!"" I am glad that I got a chance to watch this film, as I would have been missing out on a marvellously touching film.

The story behind the story.,"Peter Pan has been a childhood classic for years but never before has it been told from this angle. Johnny Depp plays J.M.Barrie, a playwright desperate for some inspiration for a new play. He meets and forms a tight friendship with a widow (Kate Winslet) and her 4 boys who are struggling to keep their life in order. This friendship then gives Barrie the much needed inspiration for the idea of a lifetime.Johnny Depp arguably does his best performance to date and he is able to accomplish this without smashing plates, or giving a dramatic soliloquies. His performance is subtle and tender. And his hard work echoed in his Best Actor nomination last February. On the ladies side, Kate Winslet is absolutely lovely in this film. She's has grace and tragedy and by half way through the film, she has completely won over the audience's warmth and love. Glimpses of neverland itself are tear jerking. When you sit back, and watch the amazing beauty of a heaven like world dance in front of you, it's hard not to get choke back some mist. Despite the warm fluttery feeling I felt when leaving the theatre, I can't seem to give this film a 10. This is mainly due to pace but the music and gorgeous visuals keep the score at a solid eight.It's a gorgeous film with love, beauty, and imagination that shouldn't be missed. PS: If your prone to crying, taking a tissue might be handy.",,Anonymous,Biography
Finding Neverland escapes the obvious paths most of the time and is a feature marked by extremely truthful performances and sequences,"Peter Pan is a great fable conceived by the Scottish playwright J. M. Barrie creates an imaginative and fanciful world that, within its own logic, addresses universal themes of indisputable relevance to its audience - in this case, the inexorability of time (in one of the most beautiful metaphors of dramaturgy, the crocodile with a clock in its stomach), the tragedy of the loss of innocence, and the shadow of cynicism that real-world brutalities cast over all of us. This film by Marc Forster seeks to portray the creative process of an author about to produce a classic.Written by David Magee (based on the play by Allan Knee), the film begins when Barrie witnesses the failure of his latest theatrical production, which sinks on opening day. Pressured by producer Charles Frohman (Hoffman, in a short but very fun participation), the playwright hurries to write a new text - and ends up finding the necessary inspiration when he meets, in a park, the widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies and her four children. Conquered by the children's vivacity, Barrie becomes the constant companion of the Davies family, actively participating (in fact, commanding) in the boys' games and doing his best to help their mother, who has been in financial difficulties since her husband's death. At the same time, the subject deals with the increasing distance from his own wife, with whom he leads an existence of melancholy and formality.One of the great attractions of the film resides in the way in which the script opens a window to the imagination of its protagonist, allowing the audience to understand why Barrie is so apathetic and out of place in his daily life: over the years, he has created in his mind an ideal world of color and harmony, completely free of fuss - a place he has perfectly christened Neverland - and in meeting the young Davies brothers, Barrie finally finds the perfect companions to share. This fantasy. Yes, in the fast-paced scientific world we live in today, the writer's attitudes would be ruthlessly classified as 'escape from reality', 'antisocial behavior' or even 'insanity'. However, at the beginning of the 20th century, even if scientific thinking already predominated, there was still room for a magical and utopian vision that today - after two great wars, the atomic bomb and the growing inequalities between rich and poor countries - makes it impossible.In fact, the relationship between J. M. Barrie and the four children would be inadmissible nowadays - if at the time there were already insinuations of pedophilia (never proven, by the way), today Barrie would simply be torn apart by the so-called 'brown press'. However, Finding Neverland portrays this friendship so innocently (albeit mentioning the rumors) that we never question the fact that, really, it is at least atypical to see a 40-something man so involved with the other people's children (especially if we consider that, contrary to what the film shows, the children's father was still alive at the time). In addition, Johnny Depp's always youthful appearance helps us to consider that relationship natural.The main point of interest in Finding Neverland is the friendship that develops between Barrie and Peter, one of the widow's sons. The boy is, of the four brothers, the one who most feels his father's absence, and for this very reason he will be the one who will be most reluctant to the emergence of a new male figure in his life. In parallel with the demand that will arise along with the birth of this new affective bond. It is the portrait of Saint-Exupéry's saying, which states that ""we are responsible for what we captivate"". If one day the loved one goes missing, do we have the right to blame them for the omission, instead of just lamenting their disappearance?The film shows, in its essence, the process of creating J. M. Barrie, the genius who owns the entire mystical and fantastical universe of 'Peter Pan'. This, perhaps, is a point that will not please everyone who is waiting for a movie intensely full of adventures and magic. Precisely because it is in a middle ground: it does not tell the fabulous story of the boy who did not want to grow up, nor can we say that it is a biopic of the renowned writer. The screenplay is based on Alan Knee's play, 'The man who was Peter Pan', which idealizes at least a little of the life of the man who was the Scottish writer, enhancing it with touches of the fantasy he himself created. This is the fantasy that the creator of the famous character seemed to have kept to himself for years, and only when he found the perfect people to share it with did he release it.After having played some very irreverent and even comical characters, Johnny Depp, who had to take classes with an instructor to perfect his Scottish accent, appears in ""Finding Neverland"" in a very different way, restrained, but still So, a great performance. However, one of the great disadvantages of the film is the cliché of the drama about the illness of the boys' mother. The participation of Dustin Hoffman is one of the highlights of this feature film, despite the role not very important.Also, it's not always the problems that arise on screen that detract from a film; here, for example, some of the shortcomings of the project concern what is not told by the story. Although it focuses on the conception of Peter Pan, for example, the screenplay practically ignores the writing of the text; when we realize, Barrie has already finished the play and is in the rehearsal phase, which is, to say the least, disappointing. Likewise, the playwright's relationship with his wife is poorly developed, trying to illustrate, through very few dialogues, the deterioration of that marriage, sounding unconvincing. However, the most serious omission of Finding Neverland concerns the connection between Barrie and Sylvia, which is practically overlooked for most of the time. Now, are we to suppose that the possibility of a romance never occurred to the couple? With the exception of a single reference made by Sylvia, this idea is simply ignored by the film, creating an emotional vacuum at the center of that relationship. As if that weren't enough, J. M. Barrie never ceases to be a sphinx to the public, as we never really get to know him.It's a shame that, like the existence of the children's father, such events are ignored by the script, which doesn't even mention them (which could have been done in a final text or in an additional scene or two). Yes, this would certainly plunge the story's conclusion into a dark mood that would send the viewer out of the screening room with a feeling of unease, which could harm the film's career - but it would also represent a far more faithful approach to the unforgettable text of Barrie, who, amidst the jokes and laughter, contained infinitely more complex, sad and distressing themes.The merits of Finding Neverland are not only in the cast, but also in a very well told story. Escaping all possible clichés (and the biggest one would be a possible love relationship between Depp and Winslet's characters), David Magee's script accurately explores the fantasy and all the charming ""naivety"" of a story that could be told from the simplest way possible. But Finding Neverland escapes the obvious paths most of the time and is a feature marked by extremely truthful performances and sequences. Winner of the Oscar for Best Score (a moving composition by Jan Kaczmarek) and awarded by the National Board of Review as Best Film of the year, this is a production that deserves to be appreciated in all its magnitude, whether for the beautiful story it tells, or for the heightened feelings it propagates. With its heartfelt and sweeping message, it is a work that deserves the recognition received and the tears provoked.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

An imaginative look at how the tale of Peter Pan came to be.,"""Just pretending? You brought pretending into this family, James.""Finding Neverland is a story about the London-based playwright James Barrie, and the special family that inspired him to write his timeless masterpiece, Peter Pan, over the course of a summer. It's a cute and charming movie, but not really the kind that I go for.Johnny Depp stars as Barrie, and gives a solid performance as the imaginative, yet frustrated, playwright. He seems to have wonderful chemistry with the young actors that he shares so many scenes with, and his interactions with his distant wife (Radha Mitchell) are suitably strained. I thought that Winslet was also good in her small role, as the widowed mother who occasionally seems more like a background character, but begins to add more to the movie towards the end.Finding Neverland is a good family film, and people who loved Peter Pan as children (or as adults) will probably love it.

Movie worthy of a different era.,"One word can be used to sum up ""Finding Neverland""- Brilliant! My wife and I are longtime fans of Turner Classic Movies and find the cinema of says 1940 to about 1970 superior to what you have today. Special effects, with the actors supporting them, seems to be the rule rather than the exception! Character development, script and skill full direction, are often lacking in the movies of today. Here we have an achievement worthy of the Academy's consideration. Forster's directing is wonderful, he weaves a powerful story full of emotion, imagination, thought and feelings, with great skill and tenderness. The principles take their characters to mean something we can identify with. The children are all excellent, particularly the young boy who plays Peter. His screen chemistry with Depp is remarkable. A word about Mr. Depp. In my view, he has ascended to the level of THE great actor of this generation.

Mildly entertaining,"I really wanted to like Finding Neverland. I just didn't connect to the characters. They were remote and unconnected. Also I felt that not enough background information was given that it did not allow me to get emotionally involved in the storyline. This was a personal story that never got very personal. Mr. Barrie (Johnny Depp) was not demonstrative in his emotions towards the fatherless boys that he befriends, with their mother (Kate Winslet) or his wife. He was very into his fictional tales, but it was not enough to keep the story interesting. Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet are great actors, they have had some very memorable and impressive roles, but I didn't think these particular roles were exceptional. Additionally the arc of the movie was so familiar and predictable I knew what was going to happen long before it did. The movie seemed to move slowly.

It had many wonderful lines, and the boys were perfect. Johnny Depp was amazing, as always, but something else too. He was, as I told a friend ""so cute"". And not ""cute"" in the usual manner applied to Mr. Depp. He was perfectly adorable, truly becoming Peter Pan--a little boy who never grew up. From my experience with his other movies, his pure-hearted role and flawless playing of it completely caught me off guard.

He definitely made me believe once again. Let me also mention the other obvious stand out in the film: Freddie Highmore who played Peter Llewelyn Davies. What a remarkable young actor. I expect great things from this young man. I love when I witness amazing talent from such a young actor. He blew me away with his simple yet moving portrayal.

I do believe in fairies! But 7 Oscar nominations?,"Miramax is masterful at pulling Oscar nominations out of their asses for their sweet sunny films that probably shouldn't be getting as many accolades as it should. That's not to say the movie isn't any good, but generally, it's all about marketing. ""Finding Neverland"" is a good sweet film that follows writer JM Barrie's creation of ""Peter Pan"".Depp plays Barrie with a lot of tenderness and goodness. Barrie, just coming off a flop and in the midst of a stale marriage hooks up with a family while at the park with his giant dog. Kate Winslet plays a widowed mom with 4 kids and she needs help. Barrie offers it to her and eventually endears himself to her and her boys becoming an inspiration for his writing of ""Peter Pan"".The movie is well done. It flows well, it's sweet, and of course it's about the creation of a classic story. Who doesn't love Peter Pan? The movie does it's job at telling a nice story. I didn't find the performances anything special, but they were good enough. Depp is good, but I think he excels at the quirkier roles.This movie received 7 Oscar nominations. I don't see it. It's a nice sweet film that is enjoyable, but I think the nominations are more the work of the masterful Miramax marketing machine. (***)",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A beautiful film,"For years, ""Peter Pan"" has been iconic, the lost boys, the never aging Pan,untouchable, whimsical and tinged by sadness without knowing how he came to be, but finally we were allowed to glimpse the soul of his creator,J.M. Barrie, masterfully played by Johnny Depp. The ever so soft Scottish accent was perfectly rendered , not blustery or over the top with all of the rough rolling of the rrrrrrrrrrrrr's and glottal stops that many performers affect while using imitating the language, but Mr. Depp delivers a believable Scottish 'burr"" that gives the appearance of having been softened from years in the world of the English upper crust. Mr.Depp's performance was warm, inviting and thoroughly convincing as a man of kindness and compassion but also possessing the child-like wonder of the world around him. His co star, Freddie Highmore, provides the inspiration for Peter Pan to Depp's Barrie, however, one comes away from the film feeling as if a true and lasting friendship has been made off screen for the two. I highly recommend this movie, it is one of the infrequent treasures of cinema that one can take every member of the family to see and yet have each member come away happy and thoroughly enchanted by the film.

What Dreams are Made of,"The world of imagination as created by Sir James Matthew Barrie is solidly entrenched in both children books and in films such as ""Finding Neverland."" Viewing the superb acting talents of Johnny Depp, portraying the 19th century English writer J. M. Berrie, is tantamount to watching a great artist at work. The film laces Barrie's life before, during and after meeting his wife Kate Winslet, with the Victorian views of the day. What is glossed over or at the very least dissipated by the delicate film are the circulating rumors, societal suspicions and vicious gossip regarding Mr. Barries' real reason for marrying the matron widow and her attractive family. The film proves witty, incisive and stocked with family values seldom found in other movies. Anyone seeking a glimpse of turn-of-the-century England will enjoy Depp's performance as he reveals the inspirational origins for his memorable story of Peter Pan. **",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Mesmerising Movie, one of the best ever","Finding Neverland totally surprised me. Considering the Hollywood flicks that we are used to see, even in the fantasy genre, this movie represents the best of both worlds, following the life of Sir James Barry, the author of peter pan and how he was influenced and inspired by a family, is portrayed in the finest manners.With star cast involving Jonny Depp, who is brilliant in adapting so many biographical roles, truly one of the most versatile artists in the industry, being the roughish yet charming jack sparrow and being the elegant and gentle James Barry in Finding Neverland , alongside Kate Winslet which i believe was an excellent choice, having a British accent and notable innocence one her face, she intensifies the drama and their on screen chemistry shines even with out a single kiss or love scene, Director Marc Forster's great direction makes this movie a treat for all ages. But truly along side screen greats as Depp and Kate Winslet the young star Freddie Highmore looks a promising actor of this business. The supporting cast of Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman is also very well executed and one never forgets their short but yet great performances on the screen.I recommend this movie to to every person who is creative in his nature or wants to be. this is not just a fantastic film but also makes the viewer ponder upon the idea of what he or she can get out of simple but lovable relationships and how we can be touched by the lives of people around us and how it effects our own perspective of life.My advice do watch it, take your kids along with you and see the magic of fantasy in a way that has not been told for a long time on the film screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Johnny Depp deserves an award but didn't get one!,This is such a classic movie. I loved it! I've been a fan of the story Peter Pan since i was really little. But something bad happened to their ratings. They only won one award. I think Johnny Depp should have one something because he did a fantastic job and deserves it. Johnny portrayed J.M. Barrie very well indeed. The accent was perfect and he made your love him. Johnny Depp has been playing wonderful and a different wide range of characters for a long time. I saw Finding Neverland twice at the cinemas and nearly everyone cried i did. The title was a fantastic title because it made me think and then i wanted to find my Neverland and of course i did and it's a great place to go. Kate also did a wonderful job too. Well Done Johnny and Kate you were wonderful! JOHNNY DEPP IS THE BEST!!!! Luv Paige (hey_all@hotmail.com),10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sound quality lets it down,"Admittedly I saw this on the Sony Movie Channel and not in the cinema. So perhaps other releases didn't have the same sound problem. But what I saw (and struggled to hear clearly) was flawed. The whispered performances detracted from the overall experience. Do actors *really* have to whisper and mumble their way through the script? Listen carefully and you can hear the dubbing mixer's ""noise gates"" working flat out. Whenever anyone speaks in the intimate whispered passages, you can hear the background mush behind their tiny voice, which has to be cranked up to maximum in order to hear what they're saying. Then the moment they stop speaking, the noise gate cuts in and the background goes eerily silent until the next line starts. Distracting at best. Otherwise, a great film.",,Anonymous,Biography
Just imagine !,"After his play's initial failure, renowned stage playwright James Matthew Barrie had the opportunity to meet the Davies family, who inspired him to write his iconic play, ""Peter Pan."" As his play gained success, Barrie's sole desire was to bring the dying Sylvia Llewelyn Davies to Neverland, which was her most fervent desire.I watched the film primarily because of Kate Winslet, but her character's screen time was relatively limited compared to Depp's. Given the character she was playing, this is understandable. I must admit that Kate Winslet was breathtakingly gorgeous throughout the film. Her screen presence alone made it worth watching. I wish there had been more chemistry between Kate and Johnny Depp. This is actually my first time watching a film featuring Johnny Depp, and I must say he acted brilliantly. His performance in the cathartic scenes was particularly noteworthy, as he brought a natural and interesting energy to the role. Kelly Macdonald's portrayal of Peter Pan was a key aspect of the film, and he did an impressive job of capturing his stubbornness, innocence, and loneliness. Julie Christie was also excellent in her portrayal of Mrs. Emma du Maurier, conveying both the positive and negative aspects of the character. Radha Mitchell was equally impressive as Mary Ansell Barrie. Special mention should also be given to the child actors who played the roles of the children of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, who delivered strong performances.The storyline is engaging, with a narrative that draws the viewer in. Although some of the initial scenes may feel slow or boring, the second half of the film shifts focus to the emotional aspect of the story, which will likely evoke tears from the audience. The well-written dialogue plays a crucial role in highlighting the film's pivotal moments.While the cinematography may not be overly varied or ambitious, the choreography of the plays is composed with skill and precision.The music composed by Jan A. P. Kaczmarek was arguably the standout aspect of the film. It significantly enriched the storyline, adding depth and value to each scene. Kaczmarek's work truly deserves an Academy Award for Best Original Score.In any case, 'Finding Neverland' is a feel-good film that is perfect for watching when you're feeling down. It also serves as a valuable reminder of the significant impact that imagination can have on our lives.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

It is for both adults and children. Adults will find this film taking them back to their lost emotions, the feeling of childhood, the memories of fairy tales and innocent laughter.

Better than expected,"I've got to say that I approached this film with some trepidation. The reviews weren't sparkling, but I've got to say that I found it quite a pleasant experience.The film is about the eternal child that is J M Barrie who wrote Peter Pan. He befriends a widow, or more precisely, her children and builds the fantasy world that will eventually spawn Peter Pan. His wife is obviously somewhat skeptical about the relationship which drives Barrie further into his imaginary world.This is very well acted and directed with a relatively slow pace which is very pleasing. Johny Depp rarely has an off day and he's on form again here. I've always find Kate Winslett alluring and she's also quite well (type)cast in her part. Well worth 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Neverland definitely NOT Found,"In short, this is a smooth viewing, but it clearly falls short in what it's supposed to supply. The good points are the entertaining watch this provides, Johnny Depp, an excellent child actor's performance (Peter), the ever so beautiful Radha Mitchell (hah...), and all in all the good story being told here.The problem is the great potential such a story/casting/philosophical point holds and is absolutely necessary to be fulfilled. And this clearly, clearly falls short of it. We're given a taste of what it could've been like, we're given glimpses of what could've been achieved here; but only sketches, elusive hints...never the real thing. This could've been a magical motion picture that dives the viewer into Neverland, and all the premises full of wonderful emotion and artistic/human sensitivity that come with it. In stead, this is a fairly flat realization of its plot, with interesting potential, never reached. Clearly not greatness, but also as clear was the potential for greatness.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Beautiful Story, portrayed beautifully!","This is a story about childhood and growing up to fast. This is a story about love, falling out of and falling into love. This is a poignant story about playing pretend and wanting to believe hard enough and long enough to make it come true! Johnny Depp is amazing! In 1991 I watched ""Edward Scissorshands"" with my children (8 & 9). At the time I thought the actor that played Edward (Johnny Depp) was a great character actor. I had never seen Johnny Depp in anything before that. Shortly after that publicity about Johnny Depp caused me to ""write him off"", I decided I did not want to support his behavior by paying to watch his work. In May of this year (2005) I went to Blockbuster to pick up a movie. I chose ""Finding Neverland"" based solely on the case picture. After the movie had ended and I had stopped sobbing I wondered, ""Who is that actor?"" When I read ""Johnny Depp"" I said out loud to no one in particular - NO WAY!

"An Education Film, but Ultimately Overrated and Boring at Times","I'm a bit baffled as to why this film is so popular with critics. It's not really connecting with mainstream audiences and didn't really work for me. My largest complaint about the film is that it is a bit slow and boring. Don't take your kids to it, expecting to see ""Peter Pan."" This is an adults film only. FINDING NEVERLAND is not a horrible film, either. It's educational in the sense that it brings to viewer back 100 years in time to a different era. Those that are ""Peter Pan"" fans may be interested in learning how the play was written. Overall, the performances were a bit lackluster, although Depp does his best.Another major problem for me is that I had a lot of trouble sympathizing for Barre (Deppe). From the first scene in the film, it is made clear that he doesn't care much for his wife and his only true love is the young boys in the film. I also find it disturbing that Barre was alleged to be a child molester, an issue that the film just glazes over. Like Michael Jackson, we have no concrete proof of this, but I would not have wanted to leave my kids alone with Barre anymore than sending them to the ""Neverland Ranch.""",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Few Films Captivate the Imagination Quite as Well as this One!,"Finding Neverland is a heartfelt film that captivates both the heart and imagination.The film follows the biographical story of ""Peter Pan"" author J.M. Barrie. The story is about Barrie and how he came up with the idea for ""Peter Pan"" through his friendship with a widow and her four boys.This film was superbly directed by Marc Forster, who is truly one of the finest young filmmakers in the modern day film industry. Forster was able to deliver a film that was both visually stimulating and truly emotional at the same time. He should be commended in particular for generating such great performances from his remarkable cast, in particular Johnny Depp as J.M. Barrie and Freddie Highmore as Peter. Both actors played their contrasting roles perfectly; Depp as a man who doesn't want to grow up, and Highmore as a child who is growing up way too fast. As well the film's score by Jan Kaczmarek is truly one of the finest I think I have heard in a long time, it's magical tones engross you within each and every scene.Finding Neverland is a highly enjoyable film that is both imaginative and touching at the same time. The film manages to tug on you heartstrings more so than any other film in recent memory. It sweeps you up into Barrie's imagination and never lets you go.

Finding Neverland Focuses on all the Wrong Points,"Plot: 13/25: Sir JM Barrie (Depp) is a playwright who is having trouble finding inspiration. His latest play was a complete flop, and the stage director Charles Frohman (Hoffman) is breathing down his neck for something new. Meanwhile, his marriage to social-wannabe Mary Ansell Barrie (Mitchell) is falling apart. While out walking his dog in the park, he meets four young boys, Michael (Spill), George (Roud), Jack (Prospero) and Peter (Highmore) and their widowed mother, Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Winslet). He befriends the children and their mother, becoming a new friend and a new father rolled up into one. Peter, however, does not accept Barrie, and acts too grown up for his age. These children become the inspiration for his next play, about a child who does not want to grow up.Meanwhile, because of his newfound friendship with the family, there are rumours going around about him cheating on his wife with Sylvia, and worse rumours about him and the children. The sequences about Barrie's social life taking a pitfall are much more interesting than the children from a story perspective. The movie tries to evoke too many emotions with the children, especially Peter. More scenes about Barrie's social life and marriage crumbling would have prevented this movie from being just attempting to evoke sympathy.Visual Effects/Directing: 23/25: I'll admit, the really brilliant part of Barrie's scenes with the children is the exceptional. When Barrie is playing with the children, we are treated to see deep inside the imagination of the group, and seeing it cut away from the land of imagination and back to the real world is done masterfully. The effects are brilliant, really bringing you into Barrie's world, though the final Neverland effect is more confusing than artistic. Overall, though, the effects are fairly astonishing. Maybe not technically, but artistically.Acting: 20/25: Johnny Depp, what can one say about him? He has shot off like wildfire ever since his incredible performance in Pirates of the Caribbean, and now I cannot walk down the street without hearing about him. This is for a good reason. Depp has quickly become one of the best actors working today, and FN is no exception for him. He truly becomes JM Barrie in every way, a man who is still a child at heart.There has been a lot of buzz about Freddie Highmore (Two Brothers) in this film, but I personally do not believe he lives up to it. Well, he does seem good, but mainly because the other three children are all so annoying (especially Michael) that Highmore stands out as being the only one I can listen to without having my head explode in three separate directions. Winslet (Titanic) is good, but not as good as she has shown in Eternal Sunshine, which she was rightly given her Oscar nomination for over this. Hoffman (Rain Man) is good, but he is in more of a cameo role than anything else.Overall, the acting is good, but those kids are so incredibly annoying I had to mark it down.Entertainment: 13/25: Finding Neverland could have been better, but instead of trying to be a look into the crumbling of JM Barrie's social world or about simply how he was inspired, it tries to reach out of the screen and yank at the heartstrings. This is just what some people want, but it seems to try too hard to evoke sadness when it should be inspiring or intriguing. It has a lot of potential, and lives up to some of it, but it could have been better.Total: 69%: Finding Neverland could have been a lot more. It shows vast potential, but is focused on all the wrong things. Sure, it is good for tugging at heartstrings, but it does so forcefully by making you sympathetic. It could have been better, but is still well-acted and very well directed, so this is not a complete waste.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Disappointing,"I cannot understand how this predictable and emotionally manipulative movie can be nominated for even a single Golden Globe award, much less five. The acting is pedestrian, and the story contrived. Even the visually interesting fantasy scenes don't quite fit.

His Scottish accent is unconvincing and annoying, and his range of facial expressions more limited than a resident of Madame Tussauds. I guess he got the leading role for the same reason Dustin Hoffman shows up as Barrie's financial backer: to give the movie a bit of extra heft at the box office.Surely there are dozens of actors in Britain who could have done a better job than either of them -- and who could use the work.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Best Movie I've Seen In Awhile!!,"I saw this movie when it first came out in theaters around Thanksgiving. I am a huge Johnny Depp fan and figured the movie would have cute storyline. A friend and I were home from college for Thanksgiving break and had not seen each other since we both left for school the past fall. This movie was incredible. It really is the perfect ""all-around"" masterpiece. It made me laugh, cry, get angry, be frustrated, and hopeful. It has been a long while since a movie was able to create such a wide-range of emotions. Over the past few years I have been very disappointed in the movies Hollywood has been putting out. They all seem to be going for the big epic to try and grab an Oscar. This movie got back to basics and I felt like I truly connected with all the characters. The best part of this movie was how my friend and I felt after seeing it. We had both just started college and were so stressed with school and money and moving and starting new friendships, that we were having trouble remembering what's important. In the words of Mr. Barry, we were ""growing up"". This movie took us back to our childhood. It allowed us to remember what it was like to play in the backyard with our siblings, act out imaginary stories as we played ""dress-up"", laugh at silly, perhaps ridiculous things, and see the magic in everything as we did when we were kids. This movie reminds us that family and friends is so important in life. And that you should not take life too seriously because if you do, you will suffer the worst fate in the world: losing the ability to have fun and find joy in almost every situation. This movie is great for all ages, but I highly recommend it to those of you who have forgotten what it is like to loose yourself in your imagination. Those of you who may be ""growing up"", or already have grown up. ""Finding Neverland"" has the ability to bring you back to your child hood.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Boy interrupted,"Disclaimer: I 'd go to the movies just to watch Johnny Depp walk across thestreet, so I'm certain that has colored my impressions of this film.That being said, Depp does a lot more here than walk across the street,although I think he should have had better writing to work with for his efforts. The story is compelling, the characters are complex and the setting -- early 20th century U.K. -- makes for great visuals (ball gowns, rustic country cottages, early cars and Victorian furnishings), but there is something that just falls short about this movie and I believe it is the writing. As a filmmaker, Forster is gifted and imaginative, which makes him well suited for the director's job on this film. His choice of folding in a play within the story of the movie was a good move. Yet it is ultimately the story path that becomes a problem -- one that wasn't helped by the less-than brilliant dialogue -- and that can be laid at the feet of both the writer and the film's editor. My complaint is that the story just doesn't hang together. In an attempt, perhaps, to elevate the James/Sylvia relationship to a higher plane, the movie merely makes it confused. Sexual tension is playeddown, the overbearing mother role is way too played up and Barrie's poorconfused, lonely wife nibbles at the edges of a relationship that doesn't quite have a form.The relationships in this film are complex and integrated, but yet the writers seem incapable of crafting a script that conveys how they are entwined. There is little exploration of Sylvia's past or how her losses affected her, not just her children. Barrie's marriage and wife are enigmatic to an extreme.Despite all this, if I had a vote for best actor in next year's academy awards, Depp would get it. What an extraordinary actor. It is wonderful to watch himwork. And walk across the street.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Silly message, but not a bad film","I've become so dismayed by the quality of the recent crop of ""A-class"" dramas that I now go into them with zero expectations, just to avoid disappointment. Finding Neverland, however, surpassed my expectation of zero and, to my surprise, turned out to be quite a good film. It's not brilliant, nor is it a masterpiece but it's definitely worth a watch and is certainly one of the better films to be released recently. The crux of the story is fundamentally flawed, as it professes that is anything is possible if we 'believe', which is, of course, a blatant falsity as anyone that has been alive longer than five minutes will know. The film appears to realise this somewhat however, and this is shown through it's ending, which lends the film some extra credibility. In spite of unrealistic message, Finding Neverland is still worthwhile as the magic of the plot does shine through and even though we know it's not realistic; we can still believe it. Don't you just love irony?Johnny Depp is certainly one of, if not the, best actor of today and he shows that in this movie. His performance is charismatic and fun, and you can tell that Depp is an artist that really enjoys his craft. He is matched by a woman that is one of the best actresses working today, a certain Kate Winslet. Aside from being beautiful, Kate has matured as an actress since films like Heavenly Creatures and her blip with Titanic and she shows that with a prime performance in this movie. Even the child actors do well in this film, which is a rarity indeed. Even more so since they're not THAT irritating. The film is notable for the way that it portrays it's central characters' fantasies, which is both inventive and fascinating, and thus lends the film an atmosphere of intrigue. The film isn't quite as magical as it thinks it is, but the magic is increased and the film becomes quite potent because of the way that it portrays it's plot. It stays away from the pitfall of fake sentiment that so many movies fall into and keeps itself alive with the strength of it's characters. Overall; not bad!",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Supporting parts are very good, too. Finding Neverland is very touching.In contrast, most films made today are not subtle. Many have a poor story. Many include poor acting.

Not A Children's Movie,"Finding Neverland was on my ""to see"" list for for several months. I had contemplated watching it with my friends but thought it might be too childish because of it's PG rating. When I finally got around to watching it I found more the opposite. Though it may have something to do with peter pan and children, it is an adult-themed film.A reputable score is salvaged from me because of the terrific performances from Winslet and Depp. The children were well casted yet forgettable in my opinion. Dustin Hoffman was neither well casted nor well utilized.My real problems come with director Marc Forster. His previous film ""Monster's Ball"" was literal misery too watch. He also directed Quantum of Solace where he again disappointed me after the previous bond movie ""Casino Royale"" was such a hit. But I was willing to give him another chance on this one.The bottom line is I felt Forster underachieved in a golden opportunity for creativity. The story sounded like it would appeal to both children and adults and Forster was caught in no- man's land. I can tell you that children will not find this entertaining at all. Their is much too drama and the few elements of imagination throughout the film are mostly only recognized my adults. The tone of the film is certainly not light and happy.I do admire the points that were able to be conveyed without the use of sex, violence and bad language but if your going to take that all out, you should at least make it appeal to kids",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Visually the movie is very beautiful with top-notch production. Moreover, I'm glad the director avoided being too sentimental with the material. Instead, the movie develops with emotional scenes that carry real value in the characters and the audience. I also have to applaud Johnny Depp, giving a quiet performance that was very wonderful.

Finding Neverland is a okay,"Basically this movie was good. Johnny Depp was good, Kate Winslet was good, and Freddie Highmore was phenomenal. The plot was believable and the film as a whole was just beautifully and creatively done. However, just during the whole film, it is slow and just good. There is nothing quite spectacular or surprising about it. I mean I can say yeah, ""Finding Neverland"" was good, but there's really nothing more to say. There are a few profound quotes but really, it's just the same Johnny Depp type of movie. It has everything going for it except for the fact that there is no extra spice. I cannot say whether or not to wait for the DVD to come out however, because movies are ALWAYS better on screen. I may also be slightly cold so my steel heart did not melt.

Amazing,This movie was truly amazing. Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp gave Oscar worthy performances. I loved every minute of it. I took my ultra straight boyfriend and he even loved it. There wasn't one part that I thought shouldn't be a part of this movie. If you see this movie make sure that you have an extra napkin (if at the theater) or a box of tissues (at home) for the last 30 minutes. I cried my eyes out :-)The movies was not what I expected. A lot of surprises and lots of things that would make anyone laugh made this movie well rounded. This movie would be good for anyone of all ages. There is nothing in it that would make it inappropriate for children and the kids in the theater were loving it. Lots of little kids giggling.GO SEE IT! GREAT,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
All we have to do is Believe!!!!!,"Finding Neverland is a 2004 American semi-biographical film about playwright J. M. Barrie and his relationship with a family who inspired him to create Peter Pan, directed by Marc Forster.This charming account of a period in the life of author J.M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) reveals the real relationships and events that served as the basis for the author's most iconic work, ""Peter Pan."" After Barrie develops a platonic relationship with the widowed Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her four sons, he is inspired to write a play about a group of children who don't want to grow up. The work proves a hit and winds up bringing Barrie and the children together in a way he had never expected.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It was OK, not great, just OK","I can't say I hated this film, but it didn't touch me with awe and wonder like many people have stated. Although I found the story interesting, and parts that were very touching, I found the film as a whole lacking. For those who like cinematography, it was beautiful. For those who like great acting, everyone in this film was excellent (especially the kids). But there wasn't enough depth to the characters that makes one really care about what happens to them and why they do the things they do. I just didn't care.

Depp Is Superb Again,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Finding Neverland.I love this movie, I cry at the end of it, what's more I am not ashamed. Depp is superb and deservedly got his second Oscar nomination, Kate Winslet does what Kate Winslet does, Julie Christie stands out as Winslet's strict, disapproving mother as Does Dustin Hoffman and Rhada Mitchell is fine as Depp's wife.They are all overshadowed by a young Freddie Highmore. He is simply heartbreaking and he has no problems keeping up with Depp, in fact he steals a scene or two from him (Depp was so impressed by him, he personally requested he play Charlie, in Charlie & The Chocolate Factory)Finding Neverland grossed $51 million at the domestic box office to end 2004 as the 61st highest grossing movie of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Finding Neverland (2004),"Directed by Marc Forster. Starring Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Freddie Highmore, Julie Christie, Dustin Hoffman, Nick Roud, Radha Mitchell, Joe Prospero, Luke Spill, Kelly Macdonald, Ian Hart, Angus Barnett. (PG)Genteel account of playwright J.M. Barrie (Depp), stranded in a rather aloof and loveless marriage, forming a deep friendship with a widow (Winslet) and her four boys; his relationship with the children goes on to inspire his most famous creation of Peter Pan, the boy who could fly. Treated less as a biopic or historical drama than a fantasy of the imagination (just as well, since many liberties are taken with the facts, and the more ungainly rumors/suspicions are entirely ignored), with the real and unreal interwoven during performance/reading flights of fancy. Tender and poignant, it may lack an especially compelling narrative but makes do with understated charm, humor and sadness. Hoffman provides a dry but droll counterpoint to Depp's irrepressible eccentricities; Christie is on hand to provide some semblance of a villain, but the matter is wisely underplayed and sacrificed by the conclusion. The imagined action can be a bit underwhelming at times, but the design of the pirate ship sequence on the high seas is a delight.73/100",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
True Magic,"Who would have thought the life of playwrite J.M. Barrie could be as exciting as his most famous story about a troupe of lost boys? It seems to be pretty close here, as Finding Neverland details the life of Barrie (Depp) as he writes his most famous play, Peter Pan. Barrie is inspired by watching a family of boys playing in the park, accompanied by their mother Syliva (Winslet). Barrie begins playing with the boys more and more often, as their youthful imaginations help him to remember his own, and inspire him to write a play of true magic.Director Marc Forster couldn't possibly have made a more different film than his last, the extremely dramatically heavy Monster's Ball - in fact, just about all they have in common is that both are quality works. And Finding Neverland is indeed a quality work, with Forster throwing in little magic touches here and there (the door to Barrie's bedroom shows a vast, sweeping landscape, representing the fantastic dreams he will have) and some superb cinematography to give the audience a sort of portal into Barrie's incredible imagination. (the camera flies, fairy like, over the audience watching Peter Pan for the first time, set to a soundtrack of children's laughter)Johnny Depp, while using a great Scottish accent, is a joy to watch as Barrie, the man who was never afraid to be a child again. He proves yet again that few actors of his generation are capable of so totally immersing themselves into a character, and playing them to the fullness of their ability. Kate Winslet is also terrific, if not quite matching Depp's level, as the harried mother of the children Barrie befriends.Surprisingly, even Sylvia's children turn out to be excellent actors, in particular newcomer Freddie Highmore, playing Peter, an overly serious who tries to grow up too quickly after the death of his father. Julie Christie is a strong presence as the snotty ""you love to hate her"" mother of Sylvia, who tries to prevent Barrie from spending time with their family, because it lowers the family's social standing. But she isn't just the stereotypical evil grandmother - her character has much more depth than that, and we are actually allowed an explanation for her snide ways. Dustin Hoffman also has a brief but essential appearance as Charles Frohman, the producer of Barrie's plays who is skeptical of the magical content in his benefactor's latest. Hoffman proves his standing as an iconic actor, raising many a chuckle in a few all too brief scenes.It's an astonishingly flawless piece of work - pitch perfect performances all around propelling a wonderful script, all handled by a terrific and capable director with a wonderful sense of story and magic. With little touches of imagination sprinkled throughout, Finding Neverland perfectly captures the tone of magic and wonder that Barrie's play was supposed to instill in the first place. It's a shame there are so few films which turn out so uniformly beautiful as this.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Finding perfection,"A simply beautiful and touching film that brought tears of joy and melancholy. Script, performance and direction working as one to bring a magical cinema visit. Not a genuine drama and no more so a biopic of J M Barrie's life, this film takes a look at the times and influences that shaped the writer's penning of Peter Pan. Marc Forster has done a fantastic job and it seems that for the performers it was a labour of love as they infuse every scene with beauty and majesty. Kate Winslet, Julie Christie and the rest of the cast are uniformly excellent but it is Johnny Depp to whom the greatest plaudits must go. I feel he is unsurpassed as an actor who chooses his roles with great integrity. Not for him the easy and lucrative route of blockbuster movies (save for his work in Pirates.. which MADE it a smash), Depp is alone in taking such risks.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

An artist that finds inspiration in the innocence of childhood and the power of imagination,"Finding Neverland tells a fictionalised version of Sir J. M. Barrie's life, so there's no point in comparing it to the actual events and looking for inaccuracies.The heart of the movie is Sir J. M. Barrie's relationship with the Davies, a family consisting of a widow and her four sons. They need him because of the lack of a father figure in their life. He needs them to escape writer's block and, most importantly, experience the excitement and innocence of the childhood he's never had. Their bond grows stronger and stronger, but not everyone appreciates this development. However, it's not another person, but fate that has the final say.The movie deals with some interesting themes such as the power of imagination that allows one to find light even in the darkest places. Also, it sheds light on the creative process of the artist, the desperate search of inspiration and the restless pursuit of an idea deemed worthless by everyone else.On the other hand, it leaves the impression that the two central characters, Barrie and Sylvia, could have been explored more, there was another side of them that we never saw.Despite the tragedy that unfolds, the ending is satisfying and reminiscent of Peter Pan. In the end of Peter Pan, Wendy is ready to leave sweet childhood behind and embrace the gifts of maturity. In the end of Finding Neverland, Peter is similarly ready to let go of his grief and move on.Not all fantasy sequences are as spectacular, stunning or imaginative as they could have been, plus there could have been more of them considering the movie's central idea. Still, the part where Sylvia enters Neverland is pure magic.Johnny Depp shows his versatility as an actor, while the rest of the cast is equally on point with young Freddie Highmore standing out as Peter.Wonderful music.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Finding Neverland,"It can be just a little bit twee at times, this, but it's still quite an enjoyable look at the inspiration behind J. M. Barrie's timeless ""Peter Pan"". We start inauspiciously, though, as his latest play garners mediocre reviews. The pressure is on - he (Johnny Depp) must write something successful else risk his relationship with impresario Frohman (the very sparingly used Dustin Hoffman). Luckily, he encounters some children in the park playing with their mother ""Sylvia"" (Kate Winslet) and there starts a friendship that sees them all, and their dog ""Nana"", provide him with some much needed food for thought. There are some flies in his ointment, though. The young ""Peter"" (Freddie Highmore) still craves the return of their late father and her mother (Julie Christie) is entirely unsure of his motives and of his commitment. It's this latter concern that grows more important as he becomes more and more integrated with and fond of this family. Barrie comes up with an imaginative plan that might help the young ""Peter"" and his mother move on with their lives before we all discover that the children are in for another tragedy sooner than later, too. There's something touchingly straightforward about this drama and that's largely down to the engaging efforts from Highmore and his fellow siblings as they mess about and play at being children, dealing with grief and progress in their own way. There's a sub-plot illustrating his own troubled marriage with ""Mary"" (Radha Mitchell) which doesn't really add much, indeed, Depp himself doesn't really do much more than gently guide the story along as we watch the power of imagination and good will empower these young people, as it did so many others in ""Neverland"" and beyond. It's about healing, sure, but it's also about adventure and excitement and the thrills of being alive and young, invincible and immortal.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Depp is a study in subtle gentle genius,"FINDING NEVERLAND (2004) *** Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Radha Mitchell, Dustin Hoffman, Julie Christie, Freddie Highmore, Joe Prospero, Nick Roud, Luke Spill, Ian Hart, Kelly Macdonald.Depp shines as JM Barrie, the Scot playwright who wrote the classic 'Peter Pan', who finds inspiration for the story  and more importantly life - for his stagnant married life with the prudish Mitchell practically pushes him into the lives of widow Winslet (equally compelling) and her brood of four young lads (newcomer Highmore, as middle son Peter is the real find here ultimately going to co-star with Depp in the remake of WILLY WONKA). The film is a sugar-coated glimpse to an otherwise dubious biography of the complicated Barrie with a few facts either merged or glossed over yet it is Depp who continues to amaze in his gentle, shrewd and ultimately humane turn making up for director Marc Foster's shortcomings in making the film a real magical experience it only treads lightly upon.",,Anonymous,Biography
Emotional as it is playful,"J. M. Barrie is not necessarily a household name, although his most famous creation - 'Peter Pan' - certainly is. In 2004's 'Finding Neverland,' we see the story of how the magic came to life through Barrie's friendship with a young widow and her four young sons.'Neverland' was filmed at the peak of Johnny Depp's career, and he really delivers as the eccentric London playwright. Kate Winslet also doesn't disappoint as Sylvia Davies, and the two of them have an undeniable chemistry when they share the screen (maybe not to the level of Jack and Rose, but still...). Of course, you can't deny the performances given by the young stars of 'Neverland,' including Freddie Highmore as the inspiration for Mr. Pan. Putting the acting aside, it's worth noting that the film is assembled beautifully. From the scenic, glamorous theatre sets and English countryside and city parks to the incorporation of imaginary settings from the mind of Barrie, there is a sense of playfulness in the editing that matches the subject matter. The soundtrack also fits the film better than the Nana costume fits the actor who must wear it.But the way the theme of never growing up can share the screen with letting go of a loved one and feel natural is truly one of the elements that is most unique to 'Finding Neverland.' It's as if the film belongs in another era - a true classic that will be remembered years from now.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
just by believing!,"Finding neverland has always been my favourite film, and today I once again saw the film.Every minute was so enchanting, so touching.When Sylvia told Jmes: You've come to mean so much to us all that now it doesn't matter it is true, even it's not true, and it will never be, I will go on pretending with you. I could feel her sufferings, from one side she wholeheartedly enjoyed the fairy tale created by james, from the other, it's too good to be true, she was so afraid that she put all her hope on to a promise that was never made.At the end when James showed her the play, she smiled sincerely with tears in her eyes.Wonderful things do exist. And there are people who will move heaven and earth for you. Nothing ever compares with it.The whole ""neverland"" thing acts like a supporting power to Sylvia and the whole family. No matter how hard life was, just thinking of neverland could spare all miserable feelings and help them cheer up. Everyone has his or her own idea of neverland, maybe now we are far from it, but by believing and trying hard to approach it, sooner or later we can get there.and I guess in childhood many of us hope to never ever grow old.

The type of movie that's good...but not That good,"I've always been rather skeptical about the Peter Pan fable. Peter Pan isn't really a children's story. It's downright horrifying. The original tale talks of a boy, living in a world of his own, never being able to grow up. A boy who went to Neverland so long ago that he can't remember who his parents were. And, in his innocence, drags other children along with him. I imagine how their parents must feel, and I always think, what a tragedy, and what an excuse for happiness? Anyway, Finding Neverland comes packaged with some stellar acting performances by Depp and Winslet, and the children were spot on. But I am at a loss in trying to classify this movie. Does it talk about hope? about the power of imagination? about love? It doesn't seem to have a focus.

Just Read the Review,"All my reviews are at www.midnitcafe.blogspot.comPeter Pan, is of course, the immensely popular story of a boy who wouldn't grow up. The Internet Movie Data Base lists 8 movies with that title, and there are many more films that have been made using the same story. It actually began as an immensely popular play on the London stage. Finding Neverland is the film based on the plays author, JM Barrie and his relationship with the Davies family and how they inspired Barrie to write the play.We begin the film finding Barrie (Johnny Depp) having just completed the staging of a very expensive, new play, which also turns out to be a bomb. His marriage is falling apart because while Barrie is himself a childlike man, his wife seems to be very much the adult who cannot participate in her husband's whims and dreams. Enter Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslet), a widow trying to support four children with very little money. Barrie immediately falls in love with her children. He takes them to the park, plays cowboys and Indians, dances with bears, and indulges every childlike fantasy they can dream up. He is every bit the child they are. They in turn are the muses for his next play. Throughout the film, we see the children acting out bits, we know of from Peter Pan. We see his inspiration on celluloid.This is a good, well made film. It is aptly directed, and the actors all do fine jobs. My English friend notes that Depp does a decent job with a Scottish accent, and as always, the remainder of his performance is top notch.My problem with the film lies within the characterization of Barrie, himself. He is made out to be a wonderful, beautiful dreamer. A man who has the heart of a child. He is someone who lives in his imagination. We see the world through his eyes. While dancing in the park with his dog, we see it transform into a circus and the dog into a bear. Anyone who dares to question his fancies, to expect him to act as an adult, is shown in a unfavorable light. Both Barries' wife, Mary (Rahda Mitchell) and Davies' mother, Emma Du Maurier (Julie Christie) do not care for Barrie's behavior and both are made out to be villains. Yet his behavior is to be frowned upon. A married man gallivanting about town with a widow and her children is neither acceptable nor Right.The film does its best to show us that the Barries' marriage is not doing well besides the problems with the Davies household. They quibble about other issues and we can tell there has not been much love under that roof for quite some time. It is also quick to point out that the relationship between Barrie and Ms. Davies is anything but sexual. In fact Barrie seems to be quite asexual. There is never a hint of masculinity or sexuality portrayed at all. But these are all excuses for allowing a grown, married man to spend all of his time with a woman who is not his wife, and four children who are not his own.The film wants us to believe. It wants us to believe that life is worth dreaming about. That the eyes of a child can see mysterious forgotten by the likes of grown ups. That they contain a secret joy we too, could experience if only we believed. It also wants us to see that if we do not behave as children, if our minds are lost in the responsibilities of adults, than we are missing out on life. It is hard to refute such beliefs. Life is hard. To be able to escape into a world of pirates and fairies is a miraculous thing. We should all be able to slip into the world of fantasy and make believe for just awhile and let the stress of being and adult slip away. But, there is the cusp of the matter, we can slip away and dream for a time, but life demands that we return. It is irresponsible and shameful to drop the responsibilities of our life, to live our fantasies. To leave the bonds of marriage for another woman, even if you never technically have an affair, is irredeemable. To accept and love a character for doing that very thing is irresponsible.All of this is not to say that Finding Neverland is without merit. In fact it is an enjoyable, well made film. It is an interesting portrait of the author of one of the English languages most beloved stories. Barrie, as seen here, was a gifted, flawed man. It is a beautiful thing to see a man filled with such whimsy. But we must be careful not to believe that being whimsical gives us the freedom to give up on being grown up.More reviews at www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Superbly acted and an amazing adaptation to Big Screen for this play. A beautiful, piece of writing with some very sentimental moments about growing up sons. Beautiful all the way around.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Finding Nothingland,"The only thing that the viewer would find after watching this pedestrian TV-style movie is unsurmountable boredom. The film portrays the pleasures of escapism in the most trivial and unimaginative way. Having Johnny Depp running dressed like an Indian in front of Kate Winslet's children can hardly introduce them to an alternative world created by the powers of imagination. Also the relations between the adults are too pat and convenient to provide any dramatic momentum in this movie. All the potential sources of conflict are glossed over in favour of a predictably lame happy ending. Adequate performances and crisp photography as someone would expect from a period piece, but not much else. For alternatives, the standard choice is ""Mary Poppins"" and the superior choice is Terry Gilliam's ""Time Bandits"".",,Anonymous,Biography
Johnny Deppth does it again !,"I was not watching a character, I was watching J.M. Barrie !! To get inside the mind of a great writer was a real treat, but to see the heart of a great writer through a great actor was fabulous. Prior to seeing the movie, I questioned how well they would be able to make us envision Neverland. To my surprise, and gratitude, I remembered being a child, with flashes of Christmas' and Halloween's past, as I watched the story grow from Mr. Barrie's experiences, to his Neverland. Kudos also to Mr. Freddie Highmore, the young man that played the role of Peter. Had there been any lesser acting by either Mr. Depp or Ms. Winslet, surely he would have carried the movie. Great movie, not just for adults !! My 5 year old enjoyed it too !!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great film,"Finding Neverland is a movie that made me feel good. Not too many movies have done that but this one did. Going into the movie, I didn't know much about the story behind Peter Pan. It truly is a fascinating story. Depp has another splendid performance even though I'm not sure it was good enough to get him an Oscar nomination. Winslett also had another strong film. The film is very heartbreacking and uplifting at the same time. It shows how the power of imagination can really change a person. Sometimes, the grim truth of reality is something that no body wants to be a part of, the thought that maybe we can close our eyes and go to a magical place like neverland is something that we all should be able to take comfort in. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Pure Delight,This is an outstanding performance by Johnny Depp in this delightful life story of J. M. Barrie. I have liked Johnny Depp in most all his film work and his performance is deserving of and Academy Award. Johnny Depp is a versatile actor who excels in most any roll that he plays. I just can't say enough for his performance. Kate Winslet as the mother of the boys that Barrie associated with was more than adequate. The one that nearly stole the movie away from Johnny Depp was the child actor Peter Davies. His acting was like he had been in rolls like this for many years. He is precious. This is on my top ten list for the year 2004 and should be on your list as well.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nice movie but fake story,"I have problem with movies that use real life characters and make supposedly biographical movies but they alter key elements that completely change the meaning of a film.
And that is the case in this movie. Basically just the names of the characters are true, most of the rest is fake or modified significantly from actual facts, including the main scenes in the movie. If they are going to take such licences, they should change the names of the characters and at most say ""inspired on the life of..... "" etc.). This killed the movie for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Brilliant!,"This film and it's childlike elements touched me deeply. As a lover of Peter Pan and Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, I was blown away by this film. The performances of the young boys, particularly Peter and John were very well acted for such young children. Kate and Johnny's interaction on screen is spectacular. The so-called ""polite affections"" as they were called in The New York Times, were what made the movie for me. The music conveyed a sense of childhood, yet an acceptance of responsibility and adulthood on the part of all the boys.

"First star to the left, and straight on till boring","I should have realized it was a bad sign ""Finding Neverland"" began with a red velvet curtain and a proscenium arch. Yes, I know, James Barrie was a playwright, and ""Peter Pan"" began as a play. But that doesn't mean that this movie should have adopted theatrical conventions. That results in a film that is, well, over-dramatic.That's one of the problems with ""Finding Neverland"". It tries too obviously and too hard to tug at our heartstrings. Instead of stirring deep, true emotions in its audience, it succeeds only in engendering a cloying and mawkish sentimentality. And, worse than that, it wrings tears from even its hard-hearted villain -- the grandmother (Julie Christie) of the boys James Barrie (Johnny Depp) befriends.Another problem is that ""Finding Neverland"" almost completely sidesteps a key point in any examination of James Barrie's life: the nature of his fondness for the Llewellyn-Davies boys. Barrie was rumored, though never proved, to be a pedophile. Only once in ""Finding Neverland"" is this issue raised. As in ""Alexander"", our hero's sexuality is not honestly explored. At best, this version of Barrie might be labeled an oddball or an eccentric -- a rather superficial assessment.The point is not to pander to prurient interests, or to dismiss Barrie as some sex-crazed monster. Rather, the film could have considered how he sublimated his desire and transmuted it into art -- in much the same way as homosexual Michelangelo was able to create Adam, David, and the muscle-bound Christ of the Sistine Chapel's ""Last Judgment"".To be sure, in this depiction of Barrie, there are hints of a lost childhood, of growing up too soon. And there is philosophizing about how quickly youth and time pass, till the Grim Reaper claims us all. But ""Finding Neverland"" fails to capitalize on an idea suggested by its final scene: that our physical selves may be mortal, but the products of our imagination can live forever.Finally, ""Finding Neverland"" is simply too staid, static, and stodgy. Except for the scenes where Barrie engages in imaginative play with the Llewellyn-Davies boys, the film lacks dynamism and energy.I was looking forward to ""Finding Neverland"". But I didn't think I would be finding Neverland dull. For me, this Peter didn't pan out.",,Anonymous,Biography
A fantastic film,"Here's what you'll hear about 'Neverland': it's 'Shadowlands,' only with Johnny Depp instead of Anthony Hopkins, and much better. That, to be sure, is the movie in a nutshell, although it does not do it near enough justice. I won't bother going into the plot, but, as everyone knows, Johnny Depp plays J. M. Barrie, Scottish author of the play Peter Pan, in the early 1900s.The accent is impeccable. You'll forget he's doing one after the first ten minutes, in fact, you'll forget you're watching Johnny Depp (and comparing him to his other roles), after twenty. Some movies are horrible, but watchable because of Depp ('Secret Window'), some are good, but needed Depp's performance to give it the edge it needs ('Pirates of the Caribbean'), but yet others, including this one, are fantastic pictures that have Depp so at the heart of the movie that he becomes the character, and the character becomes him. I could not see 'Neverland' working without Depp, not because he makes a bad film good, but because he is so integral to what the picture is, the two become inseparable. Think of a cake, and Johnny Depp is the sugar.The movie itself, however, is the flour. It melds together Barrie's imagination and reality in such a way as I've never before see. Marc Foster cuts between shots of Barrie playing with the children to shots of the same people in various fantasy worlds, and the effect is mesmerizing. I was supremely impressed by the cinematography as well. There were numerous times that I simply marveled at a brilliant camera move or framing. Many of those all-important moments that send chills down your spine are also there.All of the acting is magnificent, especially the little boy playing the child Peter Davies, to whom Barrie takes special attachment to (and for whom Barrie names his titular flying boy), who will also be playing Charlie in the upcoming Burton adaptation of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,' next to Depp. Kate Winslet and Julie Christie also impress as Peter's mother and grandmother, respectively. If there is one ill note I felt in the acting, it was in Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of Barrie's producer. Hoffman's acting simply felt a little too Hoffman-y for me. Take from that what you will.The film moves along at a perfect pace. The film was about an hour and a half, although it felt nowhere near that short. In fact, the film began exactly when it should, did not rush through anything, and then ended exactly where it needed to.Do not expect perfect historical accuracy. The film's opening credits include the title 'Inspired by True Events,' and so do not be surprised when the film deviates from true events, or eliminates people here and there.How did 'Neverland' stack up, then? Let me put it this way: About halfway through the film I decided that every writer should see this movie. By the end I decided every human should. The picture becomes more than about a writer and the family he loves, it becomes a story about what love is, and how it is best expressed. I cannot describe how incredible the movie is. I won't say that to me it was a life changing experience, but perhaps it will be to many in the audience.Go see 'Neverland.' 5 stars out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
My best picture of the year,"This film is formulaic, predictable, and even downright sappy at many points. But it's fantastic.A playwright who has the imagination of a child befriends a group of children and their *SPOILER* dying *SPOILER OVER* single mother and they inspire him to create his greatest play. It's almost exactly what one would expect from a film about the creator of Peter Pan--a film about the power and importance of imagination and loaded with fun. However, as opposed to the famous Pan, this work clearly sets out to show that there are boundaries to the use of the imagination. This film also turns out to be, despite or perhaps even partly because of the fun, heart-wrenching. I have never seen so sad a movie in my life.The acting is what saves this from being a silly, sappy little movie, really, headed of course by the always-brilliant Kate Winslet, the overrated-but-excellent Johnny Depp, and the always-brilliant Dustin Hoffman. Depp plays his character with a surprisingly subtlety and understatement, hitting every note perfectly. Kate Winslet and Dustin Hoffman don't have much to work with, but the charisma of each makes the character far more interesting than either deserves to be. In a supporting role, Julie Christie also (again expectedly) performs excellently and makes her character more than she should have been (And hasn't she gotten an awful lot of work since retiring a decade ago?); so that while watching the film, one feels surrounded by fascinating characters who, upon further study, aren't so interesting--just wonderfully acted. The surprise of the movie was probably in the performance of Freddie Highmore, who gave one of the best child performances I have ever seen (right with Anton Yelchin in ""Hearts in Atlantis"" and Emma Watson in ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"").That said, the acting is not all this film has to offer. The direction by Marc Forster surpassed the excellent direction of his previous film, ""Monster's Ball,"" which is no small feat, and made for an interesting watch, with his constant employment of visual trickery. He gives us some odd angles, some special effects where we don't expect them, and a number of other effects that hold the viewer's attention wonderfully, which may be necessary considering the somewhat flimsy story and overused themes.In all, ""Finding Neverland"" is a fantastic emotional movie led by amazing acting and wonderful direction. Under close scrutiny, it almost comes across as a fraud, but with the emotional punch it packs, it doesn't need to provide any intellectual satisfaction to make a fantastic film.I would also like to point out that, although I've heard people around town talking about it as though it's a somewhat dark portrait of a possible pedophile--it's not. Kids may even enjoy the film, because it's got a bit of a Disney feel to it and much of the interaction between the children and Barrie is very fun, so don't fear the film. I don't know how widespread this talk is, but I wouldn't want anyone to miss out on such a wonderful viewing experience due to misinformation.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
You've Got to Use Your Immigration,"""Well-known playwright James M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) finds his career at a crossroads when his latest play flops and doubters question his future.

"Power Acting, Powerful Film","Probably one of the year's best, but first the acting. Johnny Depp is one of those diamonds in the rough. Starting with a small, supporting part in Nightmare on Elm Street (where I first saw him) to 21 Jump Street, I would not have considered him anything more than another entertainer on screen. Tom Hanks, similarly from Splash to Busom Buddies to Bachelor party, who would have thought. Depp has matured into his own, so much so that within this genre of actors he will be grouped into sames like Hanks, Crowe, Brody etc as we group actors like Gable, Bogart, Peck and Stewart. (He absolutely carried Pirates of the Caribbean BTW). Next comes Winslet, who also is proving herself from Titanic, to Heavenly Creatures, to this.... not to mention Julie Christie (Dr. Zhivago)....If you are simply a fan of the art of acting and wish to see an ensemble cast of great performances, intertwining seamlessly to pull together a beautiful story then you will find no finer example than Finding Neverland.Next, the film, inspired by a true story, we well adapted (though liberties taken). Superbly written and powerfully directed, I cannot exit this comment without giving anyone a strong encouragement to GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Oddly, it came out in limited release, a shame, it should play in EVERY theater around the world. It reminds you what it was like to be a kid again......",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Barrie's Happy Thought,"Happy Thoughts A Short Review on ""Finding Neverland"" At ""Finding Neverland"" we view a film that tries to portray the life of J M Barrie (Johnny Depp), the writer of ""Peter Pan"", 1904.Neverland is where the time stops and boys remain boys. Neverland is where we all want to live in when we find out how difficult is to be a grown up, a person with responsibilities, and too much in our heads to enjoy simple things.But ""Peter Pan"" the character who is said to be inspired by ""Peter"", one of the Sylvia Llwelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) son's, is in fact J M Barrie himself. ""I am not Peter Pan. He is,"" Peter says looking at uncle Jim.This story clearly portrays the internal dreams of a grown up man, who regrets his lost boyhood days and those fantastic times that he had no shadows and he could fly.But who are fairies? Why did J M Barrie bring fairies into this? Because fairies are children's innocence and happiness. They are symbols of JM Barrie's belief that those little pure smiles will die when we grow up, when we stop believing in laughing and flying. But there is one way to get back to Neverland .To find our happy thoughts. Grown-ups have shadows and no happy thoughts.As it goes for the J M Barrie's life, we can picture a man in great anguish, struggling with his sorrow of an unhappy marriage and troubles of unsuccessful career. Here Johnny Depp gives a dark shadow to J M Barrie's character. His coldness to women around him, and his obsession with his career, takes him to extremes of abandoning his home and spending his time playing with Sylvia Davies' boys, concentrating on the one he thinks is growing up faster than others, Peter.Barrie tries to teach the pleasures of writing to Peter, as a tool to escape from the anguish of losing his father and the fear of losing his mother.Perhaps writing was Barrie's Happy Thought.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
For those who are still young at heart and have an imagination,"I expected this movie to be like Hook or even Bewitched (of course not as bad as bewitched). I expected it artificially recreate the original into a lame real life interpretation, but I found to the contrary I enjoyed the story of Barrie, the playwright, to be even more amazing than Pan himself. It does help that it was Depp playing Barrie.I have yet to find an actor who can add that element of whimsical mystique, as can also be seen in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, so characteristic of Depp. Not mention the elegance that only Kate Winslet can bring to the screen would doing the movie injustice. The movie would have suffered had it been any other actress.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Finding Neverland,"What a what a wonderful surprise! This movie was a wonderful story from a small segment of the life of Sir James Barrie. Johnny Depp is outstanding as is Kate Winslet and Julie Cristie.Barrie is a much more complex character than one would guess from his famous play or the book about Peter Pan. He was truly the boy who never grew up. But his ability to crate this magic world for children is exquisite. I am always amused by the way the British view ""Red Indians"" from the New World. They never get it right, but it is charming anyway. Captain Hood and the crocodile who ate the clock always amuse me. He included little girls in his adventures which wasn't always done at that time.However, this story was about Barrie and his love of children and play. It is certainly not the usual picture of the dour Scot. I read in his biography that he never physically matured which may explain why he stayed childlike. Johnny Depp was outstanding and mastered his dialect perfectly. Kate Winslet was excellent, but certainly didn't look like a consumptive. Julie Christie was a surprise since I hadn't seen her for a long time. I hope we see more of her.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Three in a row according to my current schedule.How could I have missed this film that was nominated for over 70 awards, winning 17, including an Oscar? Well, I fixed that today.Was there supposed to be something salacious going on between Sir James Matthew Barrie (Johnny Depp) and the four boys? If so, it was not evident.Despite the fact that their grandmother (Julie Christie) had her nose up in the air over his playing with the children, it was apparently just his way of having fun and looking for an idea for a play.Kate Winslet was fantastic as the children's mother, who was trying to hide her sickness from the boys due to the fact that already had to deal with the death of their father.Of course, his wife (Radha Mitchell) did not like the idea that he was spending so much time with the children and their mother.Of course the art direction and the sets were stupendous, and Depp was as brilliant as I have ever seen him.The addition of the orphans to the audience was, as Dustin Hoffman said, genius.This movie was just pure magic.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Would love to see this pair teamed up for future such INTELLIGENT endeavors in film. This is a far more intelligent, substantial, and ultimately MOVING film (more worthy of Winslet & Depps capacities) than either of the glossy plastic Hollywood productions of Titanic or Pirates of The Caribbean. Additional acknowledgment should be given to Freddie Highmore(the child who played Peter)who proves to be unbelievably affective/shockingly beyond his years and may just prove to be one of the best actors of the next generation.

Innovative Inspirational Exceptional Film,"Before viewing this film, I happened to see the 1924 silent Peter Pan. This made my viewing of this film an even richer experience & if you have not seen either, would strongly recommend seeing both, the silent first & then the sound. Walt Disney did a brilliant animated version of Peter Pan in the 1950's, but I feel the silent film relates & gives more meaning to seeing this film.This Neverland film is brilliant. Johnny Depp shines again in another outstanding performance. Kate Winslet, Julie Christie, & Dustin Hoffman are fantastic support. This film is touching & has a strong heart that beats through the drama. Dramatic films as well done as this are too rare today.This film shows how the human imagination can rise beyond even what an animator can put on film. It creates a perfect stage to show where human imagination can go.

"Old School Film Making, Parr Excellence!","While recuperating from a critical and audience drumming of his latest writing effort, J.M.Barrie finds solace and inspiration from a local widow and her 4 young sons. One of which goes by the name of Peter.Despite being born and growing up in Germany, Director Marc Forster seems equally comfortable in victorian London as he did in the deep south of 'Monsters Ball'. By these 2 films alone he doesn't seem to have to much more to prove to anybody.Finding Neverland is a beautiful and engaging film from start to finish in the finest tradition of sumptuous storytelling. Funny, dramatic and heart wrenching in equal measure, it never once drops the ball. Jonny Depp is excellent in the lead role of J.M.Barrie (creator of Peter Pan). His family friend and father like affection for the 4 boys is impossible to dislike and never once leans towards suspicious, despite the accusations of other characters, especially the boys Grandmother, another commanding performance from Julie Christie. Kate Winslet puts in another perfect English Rose as the Widowed mother of 4, and cold is the heart that isn't moved by her plight.Part of the reason this film stands apart from the usual, true story, period piece, is in its continual flirtations between reality and fantasy when Depp is entertaining the children. Jumping between the real and imagined several times in a single scene you'll fondly remember how, with a little imagination your back garden could be anywhere you wanted it to be. It also serves as a beautiful way with which we see Barrie slowly creating the world and characters for his most famous creation.Finding Neverland deserves all the praise and accolades it may or may not receive. Direction, script, acting and cinematography are all first class. Go on, treat yourself. Search for Neverland and you too will find yourself clapping saying ""I believe in fairy's"".One warning, don't be mislead by the Peter Pan back story, while I wouldn't advise against little children seeing it (There's certainly nothing they shouldn't see). This is a family drama and children under 10 may get a little bored.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

This movie is definitely a great try make people be their best self. Also I need to mention that if you are an artist that never give up you dreams , this is definitely something you should watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beautiful story. Beautifully acted. Beautifully directed.,"I LOVED this movie. It was an enchanting, heartbreaking, and yet delightful piece of cinema. As JM Barrie, Depp gives a fantastic performance - disheartened with adulthood and reverting to childhood, using the Llewelyn Davies family as his foils. Kate Winslet is also back on form with a tour de force performance of great emotional depth. But for me, the real honours go to Freddie Highmore, who plays Peter. Forget Hayley Joel Osment from Sixth Sense, Highmore gives such a moving performance that he is definitely one to watch for the future. I can't wait to see him as Charlie in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The last scene with Highmore and Depp on the park bench will stay with me for a long, long time. For anyone with an affection for the innocence of childhood and the infinity of an imagination, this movie is an absolute must.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Magical tale of a playwright who has 'never grown up',"An inspiring and enchanting tale of playwright JM Barrie'sinspiration for his play, Peter Pan.Excellent performances throughout - particularly Depp andWinslet, although the supporting cast are worthy of the film.This is a story that wraps you up for its 100 minutes or so and willtransport you to the England of 1904 where it is set and onwardsto Neverland itself.You will be mesmerised by the story and feel for the characters -be prepared for one or two tears also as reality is not Neverland.A fitting tribute for the centenary of Peter Pan - better than thetelegram even.Surely it will merit awards from both of the academies.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fantasy Land,"FINDING NEVERLAND is a beautifully produced costume drama. Technically the movie is very impressive, boasting excellent acting, gorgeous cinematography, sets, costumes and a lovely music score that mimics composer Edward Elgar's more wistful compositions. The recreation of Edwardian England rivals the best Masterpiece Theater productions. But there is a huge hole in the center of this movie that prevents Finding Neverland from being anything other than a four hankie tearjerker.The true-life story of famed novelist and playwright J.M. Barrie's friendship with the Llewelyn Davies family is given short shrift by a screenplay that insists on telling the tale as a genteel fantasy. Although the dark undercurrents of the story are there, David Magee's script (based on Alan Knee's stage play) elects to tell only part of the story and as a result much potential dramatic tension is lost.There is nothing unusual about movies veering from the hard facts of biography. To make a an effective audience-pleaser it is often essential that real-life events be juxtaposed for effective cinematic storytelling. But in the case of Finding Neverland the actual events surrounding Barrie's life and relationship with Sylvia Llewelyn Davies and her five sons were so inherently dramatic that changing the story even minimally seems innocuous at best.Unsurprisingly the best scenes in Finding Neverland deal with the creation, rehearsals and opening night premiere of Barrie's classic play, PETER PAN. The mawkish sentimentalism that pervades the rest of the movie is missing in these riveting scenes that swiftly chronicle the emergence of an immortal masterpiece.James Matthew Barrie was a complex and eccentric genius whose decades-long relationship and obsession with the Llewelyn Davies boys was by turns nurturing , exploitive and ultimately tragic. Johnnie Depp, tall and handsome, cuts a dashing figure as Barrie, an incongruity considering that the famed author was a slight individual endowed with average looks. Depp's performance, while perfectly workmanlike, displays none of the dark moods Barrie was known to have. The actor simply seems to be a conjurer of fanciful tales, a charming babysitter to Sylvia and her sons and a jilted husband to his self-absorbed, philandering actress/wife.The real story is heartrending and unforgettable. The movie is entertaining up to a point but it should prove disappointing to anyone with even a passing familiarity to Barrie's life and the world he created for the Llewelyn Davies boys. Andrew Birkin's biography J.M. Barrie and the Lost Boys gives a thorough and fascinating account of this disturbing and epochal love story.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Best Movie by far this year!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is by far the best movie I have seen this year! It has been a long, long time since I have been to a movie theatre where the audience broke into genuine spontaneous applause at the end of the movie! With just a hint of the POTC's ""Captain Jack"", in some scenes, Depp gives a masterful performance as J.M. Barrie, the creator of ""Peter Pan"". Once again Depp is superb in a demanding role. This guy has to be the best and most versatile actor in Hollywood today! The supporting cast is excellent too. Hoffman as Barrie's gruff but faithful and patient backer and producer, Mitchell as an increasingly frustrated wife and Winslet as a devoted and tragic mother-figure. As for Julie Christie, all that I can say about her is that, like the old cliché of ""a fine wine"", she just gets better and better with age! Although I would like to have seen more of her character in this movie, I think there is a Best Supporting Actress nomination for Ms. Christie for her work here. The screenplay is superb as is the film work. No blood, guts, foul language or over excesses of special effects here! Just a beautifully scripted and acted movie with a great cast and excellent direction. As usual, Hollywood takes some liberties with the script, but what Marc Foster does so well is show us how Barrie got his inspiration for Peter Pan while only hinting at the possible darker side of Barrie's life. In real life Barrie's world did not imitate Hollywood (it unfortunately seldom does!). However, the storyline is so good and well written that you won't care! Just remember to bring a few extra handkerchiefs for the final scenes. A wonderful movie full of drama, tragedy and the triumph of the human spirit! This movie is surely a lock for an Oscar nomination. As for ""JD"", if he does not get an Oscar win never mind a nomination for this movie, then the folks who cast their votes at the Academy should be promptly sent to ""Neverland"" themselves for a ""wake up call!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Such a far cry from the depression of Million Dollar Baby,"The storyline is very good. From the onset the sequence of introduction of characters to unfolding is at an engaging pace. The conflict and build up of tension is superbly done. The foci of the plot are masterfully followed, described and pushed along by succinct but substantial dialogue. After all characters are in place, the genius and delightfulness of the main character (James Barrie) is presented in both personal character and his artistic child the play Peter Pan. The use of medium and tight close-ups to register the emotional charge of the plot is just so well crafted.The casting is close to perfect. Johnny Depp's restrained James Barrie is a good anchor portrayal. Kate Winslett is so totally believable as the disabled artist. Freddie as Peter almost steals the show from everybody. Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman as doyens of the medium strengthen the movie by not overpowering their roles.I should have voted this the Best Picture.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Absolutely amazing!,"My all time favorite movie. It honestly was amazing. I usually don't cry at movies, but I saw Finding Neverland four times and I bawled each time.

Back on topic, yes, I would recommend this movie to ANYONE. It's got tons of drama and comedy. Amazing. Johnny Depp does an excellent job. Kids would love it, adults would love it, the elderly would love it. It's a heart warming story. I wont give it away to those who haven't seen it.

Inspirational,"Heart-breaking movie. Magical, inspirational, sheer brilliance. It's especially Freddie Highmore who acts so stunningly. All the boys are brilliant. This is a movie that moves anyone I guess, it has natural charm and delivers the true story of J.M. Barrie, his life and times in such a wonderful manner. I as being a writer myself could easily identify with Johnny Depp and his yearning for inspiration which he eventually found in the magic of pre-teen imagination and adventure. This symbolizes the necessity to stay true to our dreams and not to abandon childhood perceptions of magic and the simplicity of life. Again, inspirational! For the young and those young at heart. Long live the Lost Boys!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Big Disappointment,"FINDING NEVERLAND was a big disappointment to me. I was expecting an enlightening, magical look at the creative process and what inspired James Barrie to write ""Peter Pan"" around the turn of the century. I felt as a viewer I got very little. We never learn the first thing about the man or his playwriting abilities. Johnny Depp plays this character on one note through the whole film: there is no emotion, no passion, very little to reveal the inner character. He is portrayed as a hack playwright who somehow rediscovers his muse by hanging out with four young boys and their recently widowed mother, day after day, week after week. He neglects his wife at home. He never explains anything about why he is doing this. The basis of the plot is his deteriorating marriage, and the hostility of the widow's mother (Julie Christie) toward his attentions to the family. This film is extremely slow-moving and drab, the plot mundane, and virtually nothing ever happens that is intriguing, unexpected or remotely magical. Maybe as a Baby Boomer I was conditioned to expect a Disneyfied concept of Peter Pan. I somehow expected more. I have enjoyed Johnny Depp in other films but this is to be avoided unless you are searching for a sedative. About the only positive thing I can say is the boy who plays one of the kids, Peter, (Freddie Highmore) was quite appealing.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Finding Neverland,"This is a great movie and I recommend it to everyone! It's a magical film that will make you feel like a kid inside. People of all ages will love it, kids will love it and so will adults.

Peter thinks he have to be grown up, that he doesn't have to feel the pain of losing an important person. He lost his fantasy, but Barrie helps him, to get his fantasy back. The play is the well-known Peter Pan... I specially liked the understanding, which is Barrie given to the Boys. He is a friend and ally for the whole family.

A must see,This is without a doubt one of Jonny Depp's finest performances. He shows us a man of many characters within and without. Although we do not find out as much about the man as a biography we do get a glimpse of the period of time he wrote Peter Pan. This story of that period of time in J. M. Barries life brings many exciting insights to a tale most of us know. The supporting cast has quite a job and does it admirably. Just keeping pace with Depp's energy is a daunting exploit. A movie that you can bring the whole family to and not worry about scenes that would be objectionable in any way. I highly recommend bringing a box of tissues with you. You will be having tears of joy...,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Bit Dreary: Good for a snooze,"This 20 minute film is somehow stretched out to over 1hr 40 minutes. There's little to get excited about in that time. For those who know the story of how J. M. Barrie wrote Peter Pan there's nothing new. It might hold interest for those who don't know how it was derived.The internal demons & driving forces that spill out are undoubtedly responsible for a timeless masterpiece, unless you saw it as a dark tale, which I did even as a child. The more I find out about Barrie the more the darkness seems obvious. Just like the classic ""It's a wonderful life"" scratch away at the surface cheer & seemingly happy message & you will find that it is under-laid with sadness, sorrow & regret. Fear of aging, the loss of innocence & the desire to escape from the world all pervade Peter Pan.For me these avenues are not adequately explored, although they do at least get a mention, which is something of a first.The best part of this film was Johhny Depp, closely followed by Kate Winslet, at last shedding her the stigma of her role in the truly God Awful Titanic. Depp is almost always watchable & makes interesting films. He even shows that he's able to master a passable Scots accent, although it was decidedly shaky at times (I used to live there, I should know). Winslett is still playing the solid, dependable type, which she needs to break away from if she's not to become typecast. But again she's watchable & assuredly professional, unlike the plethora of ""Stars"" that crowd the screen these days who basically recite lines & can't actually act (are you listening Mr DiCaprio?).Julie Christie, a lifetime away from her role in Dr Zhivago, is brittle & edgy as Mrs Barrie, but Dustin Hoffman's role as the indulgent theatre producer, Charles Frohman, seems to at last have found that third rank niche that he truly deserves. For far too long he's traded on his part in The Graduate, seldom rising to that level & never exceeding it. He does act with restraint, something that must have been difficult for him & there's thankfully no breathless grandstanding from him as in truly boring ""Outbreak"".It is interesting that Hoffman also played ""Hook"" in the film that explored that character a little further in the Peter Pan tale.Despite all the positive aspects I still can't see the attraction of the film. For me the best part were the out-takes, where Depp, Christie & Winslett, along with various members of the cast, all fool around. The scenes with the dog were surely worth the price of the DVD rental alone, Depp turns the fluffs into pure comedy, mindful of exactly how it will look on the screen even though it will never be shown. This man is a genius & you have to wonder if he will ever find a project that will fully exploit his creative talents. The mistakes with the actors flying gear are also hilarious.This is a chick flick, so guys be prepared to be bored. If you've been forced into watching this by wives or girlfriends make the excuse to go & get some tissues (they'll need them for the weepy bits) & don't come back before the end of the film, then sit & watch the extras & out takes.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Nutshell Review: Finding Neverland,"This is the second movie I watched in yesterday's 3 movie marathon.Who would've thought that even James Matthew Barrie can get writer's block and his latest play proved to be such a bore. The film opens with high English society going a cinema of yesteryear - the theatre - and by the end of it, JM Barrie knew he needed something special to stay at the top of his game.Chance allowed him to meet a widower with 4 boys, and needless to say, their life experiences together form the basis of his most famous work - Peter Pan. However, through spending much time with this family, his own loveless marriage spun out of control, while at the same time, he finds new meaning in life with his teaching of imagination and escapism to his new surrogate family.This film briefly explores the nuances of high society in the Victorian age, as things like these set tongues wagging, and is equivalent to the current day scandals. We're also treated to a behind the scenes look at how the theatre group pulls off the fantasy elements of the play - you'd have to believe it's there, and Barries' masterstroke in inviting orphans to the premiere of Peter Pan.Johnny Depp does it again with his top notch acting. He's one of the few character actors around, and takes his performance to another new level. This film, given Barrie's encouraging use of imagination, allows Depp to showcase multiple roles when he plays with the kids, and one which audiences immediately identify with, is the shade of Captain Jack Sparrow when he portrays a pirate.Kate Winslet does a commendable job as the children's mom in a single parent family, being the strong pillar to 4 young boys, and yet, being so vulnerable because of a critical illness.Dustin Hoffman chews up his scenes, and the best irony comes in his initial disbelief that Peter Pan can pull it off (There are some of you who remembered that he played Captain Hook in Spielberg's Hook) This is a nice touching drama on soaring life with imagination, the background tale behind the boy who never grew up, and ladies, be prepared to bring some tissues for this one - even my eyes did well at the end of this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

I didn't even notice I was until I looked over at my friend who was bawling her eyes out!!It wasn't just Depp though, I thought all the main actors did a really great job, especially the ""Peter.""

Finding Neverland an amazing movie,"Finding Neverland has to be one of the most amazing movies I have seen in a long time. Knowing the story of Peter Pan it is amazing to see all the little details come out in this movie. Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet provide superb performances and if they don't get at least nominations for Academy Awards, then the Academy needs new members. Johnny Depp gives his best performance to date, proving that not only can he act in the quirky films that he has done so far, but he can also carry and perform a straight actor in a drama such as this. Depp's performance is one of the highlights of this movie, as he brings J.M. Barrie to life. The little boy who plays Peter in this movie is a phenomenal actor for such a young child.

"Beyond brilliant, this movie is inspiring.","There was a time when I had lost all hope and faith in Hollywood's ability and willingness to create film as art as opposed to film as pure revenue creators. This movie has reformed me.The way I view films relies almost singularly on one set of criteria: where are the flaws, how many are there, and can they be forgiven/overlooked? Finding Neverland destroyed my method beyond all repair. It was a bit like inserting a metal rod into a wood chipper.Where are the flaws? What flaws? How many are there? There are none to be found. Can they be forgiven? The only thing this movie owes us is that it didn't go on for another 30 minutes.So enveloped in this story was I that I could have spent the night in the theater hanging on to every word of a 12 hour movie. I did not want this movie to end because it was too perfect. It's like being a millionaire for only 2 glorious hours only to be forced back into our sad, wretched lives.You owe it to your children (I would suggest ages 8+ because some scenes are just too powerful for young minds) to take them to see this movie. Heck, you owe it to yourselves. I defy you to endure the entirety of this movie with dry eyes. I defy you to walk out of the theater without a knot in your stomach or a lump in your throat.

Pure movie magic.,"Drama's normally always have the awful tendency of over-dramatizing moments. ""Finding Neverland"" is actually one of those rare movies that doesn't go over-the-top and none of the dramatic moments feel forced.""Finding Neverland"" is a biopic based on the life of play-writer J.M. Barrie, best known as the creator of Peter Pan. The story takes a few liberties with the truth, just like every good biopic always has done. There is never anything wrong with taking some liberties with the story, as long as it is good for the movie its story and main character.The movie its story is truly magical. It shows in a beautiful way that there is a child in all of us and we should not be afraid to show that at times and stop wanting to grow up so eagerly but instead enjoy the little playful things in life. The story works because of the actors their screen chemistry and some beautiful looking sets and costumes. The movie is not all joy, there also are some dramatic moments that work really well and powerful in the movie without ever going over-the-top.The cast is impressive; Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Freddie Highmore, Julie Christie but perhaps the most underrated actor of the movie is Dustin Hoffman. I absolutely loved him in his role and he portrayed his character extremely well. Also look out for a small part by Mackenzie Crook as the usher of the theater.The storytelling of the movie is magnificent and is what makes ""Finding Neverland"" one of the best dramas of the past couple of years.

Depp is a master. I don't say that lightly.The movie is heartwarming. The actor who played real-life Peter did a marvelous job with his character.

what is the meaning of life?,"It's the oldest question in the book... What is the meaning of life? Is it to be rich? Is it to be famous? To climb up your social status? Or can we just live the day, enjoy every moment, try to inspire others without any interest in our well-being and in the consequences? This is what this movie has been about, for me. About being different. About not wanting what everybody wants, not seeing what everybody sees or wants to see, not being afraid to act childish and in someways stupid, letting go of one's imagination and allowing one's self to dream. This makes the film for me an excellent piece of work. The actors, especially Johnny Depp were great. Every one fits their role nicely and feels it 100%. The craziness of the writer for Depp, the business man / art promoter for Hoffman, the ultimate mother for Winslet and so on. The direction was also great, playing with the scenes, going in and out of imagination leaving me with only one regret: that I live in the information age, where all of our imagination is slowly killed by television and special effects.

The magic is missing,"Production Values: Excellent; great cinematography, costumes, sets, etc.; sure to be nominated for Oscars in several categoriesCharacter Development: Good, as you would expect in this kind of movieCharacter Appeal: Kate Winslet's Sylvia is warm and appealing, but Winslet doesn't have that much to work with here. Depp's Barrie is oddly stiff and restrained.Target Audience: More likely to appeal to women and children.My Take: After seeing the previews, I was prepared to love this movie. Yet despite the fact that Neverland oozes quality, it didn't hold my interest until the final third. Up to that point, the movie consists mostly of scenes in which Barrie plays make-believe games with Sylvia's children. These scenes didn't work for me at all. Barrie is supposed to be relating to the children on their level, like Peter Pan. But Depp's Barrie pales in comparison with the character Barrie created. Depp isn't nearly as convincing in the role of child-man as Mary Martin was in the classic TV version of Peter Pan. It doesn't help that the director chose to insert fantasy sequences during the make-believe scenes rather than letting Depp use his acting skills to convey each imaginary situation. The only other potentially interesting thing going on in this first section of the movie is the budding relationship between Barrie and Sylvia, if you can call it that. There is not a touch between them or even a longing glance. They only talk about the kids, not each other. The movie does pick up in the final third when rehearsals start for Peter Pan. But in the end it becomes an overly sentimental tear-jerker. 6 out of 10",,Anonymous,Biography

I really enjoy action movies and exciting movies-those rated R-but, movies like this should be what people really want to see. An inspirational film of the imagination. I think that is what we need to get back to. Out of all of the ""Peter Pan"" movies, I say this one is the best. It is not the story of Peter Pan but the story of the man behind it. It really captivated me and it compelled me to look at my own imagination and want to captivate others. It really did.

Of course, Johnny Depp is my favorite actor of all time, but besides that, all the other actors play believable performances, as if you forget they're Johnny Depp or Kate Winslet (reminiscent of Jamie Foxx's performance as Ray Charles.) Freddie Highmore (who co-starred with Depp in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") is a promising young star who has much talent... I hope he'll go on to play more great roles. David Magee's script is beautifully crafted, and the cinematography and direction of the film under Marc Forster is beautiful and breath-taking.

He is the irrepressible spirit of youth.,"Under pressure due to his success, in a token socialite marriage, playwright J.M. Barrie is less than enamoured with his lot. Then whilst out walking his dog in Kensington Gardens, he meets widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies and her four young sons, George, Jack, Peter and Michael. It is the start of a long lasting friendship that revitalises Barrie and brings about his masterpiece, Peter Pan.OK, lets get the grumble out the way, you know the one, the one that so many are quick to mention. No this is not a definitive take on J.M. Barrie and this time in his life. Much like Allan Knee's play, ""The Man Who Was Peter Pan"", from which this is adapted, there are liberties taken and it's most definitely chronologically unsound.But this is not a biography is it? This is basically asking what sort of man conceived the magical world of Peter Pan? It's a celebration of childhood, life, whimsically asking us if it's wrong to keep the inner child in us all locked away as adulthood takes control? A tale of comedy blended with tragedy, from which glorious art is born to live long and forever, the kind that will be touching generations long after we have left this mortal coil.Elegantly crafted by director Marc Forster and his screenwriter David Magee, Finding Neverland could so easily have given way to over sentiment and floundered in the search for emotional kickers. Yet it doesn't because Forster (immeasurably aided by the lush cinematography by Roberto Schafer) has created a quaint Victorian world, a world where fantasy is never far away. What emotion is here (and there is lots of it) sits perfect within this setting. We are actually being asked to be Barrie himself, the makers daring us to not be swept up in the magic being born. Wonderful, wonderful stuff.Johnny Depp is perfectly cast as Barrie, delicately fusing childish playfulness with inner sorrow, Depp doesn't put a foot wrong. It will be a crime if this multi talented actor doesn't finish his career with the highest acting honour on offer, the Academy Award for Best Actor (nominated three times, including this performance), it's practically impossible to imagine another actor in this generation nailing the role of Barrie like Depp does. Playing off him expertly is Kate Winslet as Sylvia, raw and honest like, it's emotionally driven and gnaws away at the audience's heart strings. Yet it's young Freddie Highmore as Peter that steals the show. Very much the film's heart, his relationship with Barrie has a grace about it, with Highmore (just 12 at the time) able to portray a subtle tenderness that drives the relationship forward.Nominated for seven Academy Awards (including Best Picture), Finding Neverland won just the one for Jan Kaczmarek's poignant score. It matters not, because to me at least, this will forever be a personal favourite film. Something that just like Peter Pan himself, will never ever get old. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Never ever  again (dad),"I'm honest I had prejudice against this movie: 1) I'm bored with Deep 2) making a movie about an author is the ground zero of a story: Barrie wrote « peter pan » : here's the story ! how he got his ideas is not a story ! But as Kate was in it, I forced myself to watch it. Unfortunately i just hold on a couple of minutes : Barrie is dangerously cheating his wife and that's not an attitude i like ! I have saw the kid in the awful « Spiderwick » and he is as bad as previously ! Kate is ill throughout the movie and there is nothing entertaining for me ! I push « forward » most of the time : i watched the opening of the play but it feels so weak to watch that in the movie that i just zap it to the end ! In conclusion, just prefer « hook » or Disney animation and you will find fun and magic about childhood ! As for me, i long to reach my 1000th review as i will stop to write about those bad movies and lose twice my time!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
What movie making is all about,"I consider myself to be a real movie buff (or couch potato depending on your perspective). This movie is absolutely magical in its ability to transport the viewer into another time and place. Johnny Depp is spectacular and plays the role of Barrie so well that you even forget it's Depp playing the part.I did not see this at the theaters because the trailer was garbage. The last thing I wanted to see was another ""Hook"" or silly Peter Pan movie. This movie is so splendid that it leaves you wanting to know more about this remarkable person and wishing you had just a touch of his ""fairy dust"" in your own life - the power to believe would be enough to sustain us all!!

Absolutely brilliant.,"An extraordinary and heartbreak story! One of the most unforgettably hypnotic and touching films I've ever seen, the movie is absolutely brilliant. It is not just a beautiful film, it has a touching story, quite different conditions and a magic casting. Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet are brilliant, as usual. Actually both of them are my favorite actors/actresses and I'm not disappointed of their effort in this heartwarming movie, if anything, the other way round! BUT Freddie Highmore stoled my heart with his surprisingly acting! I saw Charlie and the chocolate factory before this movie, and now I'm sure that he is going to be the next big star. And he is absolutely the cutest actor in the world!It's a fantastic movie but even more fantastically acted! It also has terrific, magnificent and glorious music. (You will find the childishness in you.) And I never thought Neverland was that beautiful.The movie also contains some important messages. And just like Albert Einstein himself said: ""imagination is more important than knowledge."" And that man was smart!You'll laugh, you'll smile and you'll cry. I highly recommend Finding Neverland to everyone. And without a doubt - you will find the childishness in you.So.. how far can YOUR imagination take you?",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Absolutely delightful,"Finally, finally, I saw this movie. I had taped it on my VCR a few months ago but was hesitant to watch what I call a ""period picture"". You know stories about the wealthy, spoiled class of folks in England during the last century. Yes, it was briefly about this class of people but only because they were in the audience of Barrie's wonderful plays. His relationship with the children made me jealous; I wish I could have been one of them. Johnny Depp (who I think is a fantastic actor)brought the character to life in a quiet, subtle manner which added to the charm of the movie. I'm usually a fan of movies that make me think and become angry at man's disregard for his fellow man at which time I want to rise up and say ""Right on"". However, this movie ""charmed the angry beast"" in me and gave me the feeling that ""all's right with the world"". At least, at that time and that place. Today, I still feel the warmth that emanated from the play ""Peter Pan"". If only we could enter that world more often and forget all the ills of the world.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just Believe,"I finally saw Director Marc Forster's ""Finding Neverland"" on DVD. It is an absolutely wonderful movie that is so very touching. It is a great movie. It was one of the best movies of 2004-- very deserving of its Academy Award nominations. Johnny Depp as J.M. Barrie, author of ""Peter Pan"", is simply awesome. Depp again demonstrates that he is the most gifted and versatile actor of his generation. Depp has this mercurial air about him, and is so present in every scene-- he is just being. There is a breathtaking scene half way through ""Neverland"", where young George expresses concern about his Mother (Kate Winslet), and Barrie (Depp) acknowledges George (a very good Nick Rod) for becoming a young man right before his eyes, ""...The boy is gone. In just the last 30 seconds..."" Young Freddie Highmore as Peter Davies, the muse of Peter Pan, is amazing. Peter's on screen relationship with James Barrie is deeply compassionate and inspiring, and makes ""Finding Neverland"" a very special movie and experience.Screen writer David Magee's ""Finding Neverland"" is based on the play by Allan Knee, ""The Man Who Was Peter Pan"". Magee's words are equally magical. ""Neverland"" tells the story of how J.M. (James) Barrie created Peter Pan in 1904. Barrie (Depp) at the time was a renowned play-write, who is in the midst of a dry spell. He along with his benefactor and producer, Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman, who injects a great light touch), have weathered a stage flop. Barrie must create something that audiences will embrace. Barrie develops a relationship with a widow, Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet), and her four young boys, George (Nick Roud), Jack (Joe Prospero), Peter (Freddie Highmore), and Michael (Luke Spill). Barrie is married, and his wife Mary (a good Radha Mitchell) is not pleased that her husband is spending all his time with another family. Though their marriage seems to have died years ago. Also displeased is Sylvia's mother, Mrs. Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie). By Barrie spending so much time with the family, Sylvia's value is depreciated. In a more contemporary sense people start talking about Barrie, in particular his spending time with the Davies boys. There is a strange and unintentional allusion to Michael Jackson, a Peter Pan fan, but that goes no further.Barrie notices that Peter, who is at first resistant to him, seems in a hurry to grow up, thinking that things are less painful as an adult. Peter has taken the death of his father especially hard. In a stirring scene with Barrie, Peter tells him that he will not tolerate adults ""lying"" to him. That had happened with his father. Kate Winslet plays the strong Sylvia who is keeping her family together, and at the same time battling her mother (Christie) for her sons' futures. Kate also guards a secret. Julie Christie is a excellent as Emma du Maurier-- she is not at all what she first appears to be. This in part illustrates what is so special about ""Finding Neverland""-- it celebrates the very best in people. Freddie Highmore is the standout as Peter, though the rest of the Davies boys are amazing and such mature performers.The last 20 minutes of ""Finding Neverland"" is so very touching and inspiring. I now will read Barrie's ""Peter Pan"". I finally got that ""Peter Pan"" is not just a fairy tale, rather a metaphor. We all grow old, in this we don't have a choice in the matter. However, if a part of us remains young, the part that makes the world always new and miraculous, not necessarily believing in fairies, rather remembering what that was like, then we grow old, without being truly old. Maybe that is finding Neverland. Barrie says to Peter at the end, ""Just believe."" That is well said. Forster and Depp have made something very special here, and have also made a bold request of the audience in ""Finding Neverland"". Just believe.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An absolute delight,"I don't think I can find words to describe the amazing experience that was watching this beautiful film. I laughed, I cried and I learned.This movie is a gem; a treasure to be discovered with a whole lot of 'heart'.Both Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet are terrific.

Neverland is an escape it is true, but could someone please show me the way to the door? Little Peter's performance was quite extraordinary and I do not seek to take anything away from Johnny Depp or Kate Winslett. Quite the first time that Julie Christie has had to take such a role (so far as I am aware).

Johnny Depp at his all time best....,"There are a very few films that leave you wanting more, leave you speechless for a moment. This was one of them. Along with me, nearly the whole audience were glued to their seats for sometime after the film was over. It has been made very beautifully and all the actors have played their part to perfection. A very touching film, certainly touches your heart. Johnny Depp as usual played to the galleries, Kate Winslet played her part very well, Dustin Hoffman in his short role made his presence felt, the child playing the part of Peter was brilliant, the whole cast was excellent. This film has to be seen to be believed. Such films are a rarity these days and is surely going to make to my DVD collection. The director has done a fantastic job. Johnny Depp certainly deserves to be nominated for the best actor. As a Johnny Depp fan, I would highly recommend this film, superlative performance.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Believe,"I believe in many things, truly, because believing is one of those obligatory terms of life. If you don't believe in something, it would be having no reason to be alive.That said, believing is maybe the main message of this film. In many moments, when we're watching it, maybe we can realize how simple it is, just because there's nothing totally outstanding about it, visually. But its story, is just one of those that carry you all along, no matter what. You don't have to be a kid to enjoy this one, in fact, it shows adults some things also.The characters in this film are as warm and natural as possible. You know what happens here is no fantasy, it is reality. You could easily see this events any day in your ordinary life. These kids meet the man and they just can't let him go. And the greatest thing, it's that it could be because of them, but mainly it is because of him. This is a man who has so much inside waiting to let go and show, and he has found the people to reveal these things.Then there is acting. Johnny Depp is a genius, in everything he's ever done. He knows just, no the right, but the only notes, for the specific moments in this film, and in many others. How does he do it? Well, I don't mind to know if he continues to show magic every time he's on screen. Here he has given another performance of those he can only give. Freddie Highmore reaches some moving extremes, handling them very well, becoming the revelation of the young cast. And Kate Winslet is wonderful.There's just a lot of things that make this movie what it is. You just go and see it for yourselves and let go imagination to those sometimes unreachable places.But you have to believe...",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Touching, mellow, and worth the while","Almost definitely certain to quite surreptitiously lead to the formation of at least a lump in the throats of even the most stoic, 'Finding Neverland' does an excellent job of tugging at the heartstrings, and pleasurably so, with no perceptible trace of melodrama.The famous Peter Pan himself takes backstage, as the events leading to his conception comes alive in this well-crafted story about the struggling playwright J.M. Barrie's creative process, and his muse, the Davies Family. The relationship between them, and in particular the young Peter Davies, develops in bursts through the movie, as J.M. Barrie scripts his play drawing from his experiences, which culminate in the joyous and climactic zenith of Peter Pan's opening night. Inexplicably, the audience, and we, are drawn in to the fertile imagination of the playwright. As it comes to an end not on bed of roses, but rather on a bittersweet note, the best notion one could probably take away from this movie, is that perhaps dreams, however surreal, are worth having, if only for their ability, at times, to alleviate reality.Johnny Depp delivers a commendable and understated performance, and is done justice by the whole cast, recreating Victorian turn of the century London for the viewer, in all its grandeur and social mores.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I loved this movie,"This movie is great. Not only was the casting great but the whole movie. Some people need to watch this movie when they are feeling down and the world is not exciting anymore. With a little imagination you can go everywhere even if you are not a child. Hey grown ups can use their imagination as well. Johnny Depp's performance as Mr. Barrie was superb. You can tell his heart was in it. So genuine and kind and that's why I believe he is one the greatest actor. He can play any part. Kate Winslet also was great and these two had great chemistry. Not as good as he and Christina Ricci. But I recommend those who are young at heart and loved the book/play/movie of Peter Pan, to watch the story behind it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
too much of a fairytale to be true,"So this is a film about a famous writer of Peter Pan, James Matthew Barrie, but in my opinion this movie is a fairy tale and does not reveal the truth about the author.I think that Barrie is not shown in a realistic way, in the movie he is shown as the child in a man's body and how he is not understood by the people who surrounds him (Emma Du Maurier,his wife...), how they misjudge him and so on. I think that's fake and that this movie was made for a very average movie viewers and for us who have a little more brain this movie is not 8.2 out of 10. The real life of J.M.Barrie was a bit different, some people say that he was pedophile and that's why he was spending so much time with children unfortunately we don't know what exactly was doing with them or to them but in my opinion he was a little bit ill in the head and the right genre for this movie should be drama not fantasy. Being ill in the head was probably a good thing, almost every famous writer, poet, painter, philosopher... was a little bit ill, and if Barrie wasn't he probably wouldn't have written such great book as Peter Pan, so it's a shame this movie was made for the Oscars and not for the true movie fans.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Outstanding drama.,"I will make this short. Finding Neverland is quite likely the best dramatic movie in 2004. Johnny Depp plays a fantastic role, easily the high spot of his filmography. The movie its a brilliant journey to a man's mind. The very man who imagined the Neverland, and made us dream with a world unlike any other. Peter Pan sure is an incredible character after all. By watching the movie, my childhood memories were mixed up with some kind of an emotional spirit that drives the plot since the first minute. Finding Neverland comes out as an outstanding, spirited, heart-driven movie which may and will probably appeal to anyone. I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Vastly Overpraised,"The problem with seeing any movie that has been praised to the skies is that elevated expectations are very difficult to meet. And, I need to confess, that may be part of my problem with ""Finding Neverland."" But it is far from being the only problem. An immense amount of talent -- Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Julie Christie, Dustin Hoffman and the beautiful Radha Mitchell -- has been lavished on a story that might have been an interesting biography (to the extent that it's true) but that, in my personal opinion, simply does not make it as a film. Frankly, I find it difficult to invest any real interest in how James Barrie came to write ""Peter Pan"" or in the peculiarity of his relationship with the widowed young mother of four boys while failing to maintain any kind of relationship with his wife. I enjoyed watching the still beautiful Julie Christie in her unsympathetic role as the grandmother of the four boys and wondered why Dustin Hoffman would take a minor role that makes no use whatsoever of his immense talent. Johnny Depp is certainly versatile. I'll give him that. But I haven't been much impressed with his acting in other parts and he didn't impress me in this one. As for Kate Winslet, she dies beautifully. All these actors must have seen something in the script that I didn't see in the movie. Or is it that show business is ever fascinated by show business stories? This isn't quite a turkey but it's not a cause for Thanksgiving either.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
a great film for the whole family,"I thought that this movie was excellent, the tale of the man that wrote Peter Pan was portrayed through the masterful art of Johnny Depp. this movie is on my favorite movie list, and I've seen it at least 3 times. This movie, with it's many emotions, made me laugh, cry, and think. I highly recommend it to families with children over 8, because the plot may be a bit confusing and might need some explaining, which always ruins the movie for those who understand it. This movie was so cool to watch, and still surprises me even though I've seen it many times. I think that the mood of this movie is a bit sad, but very hopeful and sweet. the main little boy is played by the same person who did Charlie in 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'.

I'll admit i am not a big fan of sentimental films but this was different in the way it was presented and the movie was so entertaining. No guns swearing and especially no sex and violence so the entire family can go for a change. I give this movie 9/10 because thats the best in my book. A MUST SEE!!! Johnny Depp has an effortless Scottish accent which is absolutely not easy to accomplish no matter how easy he makes it seem. The three children were all superb and added to the quality of the overall product. Even though this may not win any awards, it certainly deserves recognition.MUST SEE 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

It's just a great story with terrific period costume thrown in and a wonderful theme as well. It is certainly appropriate for some younger viewers as there is no sex, no violence and lots of neat scenes depicting J.M. Barrie's staged plays and looks inside his Imagination. It also deals with the issue of death in a very mature way without being maudlin at all and without delivering platitudes, religious or otherwise -- and also without talking down to children (the Davies boys have recently lost their father when the movie opens)",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Beautiful, Enchanting & Magical...","I never tend to write reviews, or even feel the desire to do one after seeing a movie. But, there are those rare films that you manage to come across, some by accident, and some just by word of mouth. This was a movie, I felt I needed to see, for the most part because I'm a huge Depp fan. So, I actually bought this before I saw it and went in with high expectations, which I rarely do. Without surprise, it surpassed my own expectations. Johnny Depp was again, wonderful as ever.I fell in love with his works after coming across Edward Scissorhands. He's just good at what he does, there's no way to explain or justify the life and passion he can bring to whatever movie he decides to devote himself to. I also now know why he suggested the boy from this film to be in the new hit, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. This is one of those movies that just touches you, and if it doesn't, I'd be shocked. I don't think anyone can watch this and not love at least something about the magic it creates and lets enter your heart. (I'm starting to sound corny).Of course, it is sad, but it doesn't leave you feeling depressed. It's just extremely beautiful and uplifting. I just wanted to voice my love for this movie, and how I was lucky enough to get a chance to view it. This movie was bought as a small birthday gift to myself.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A perfect title for a wonderful film,"This is modern film making at its best. While it was a treat to both the eyes and the ears, the story and the actors were what carried the movie. I had already held both Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet in high regard as actors, but their performances in this film have turned that regard to admiration.As playwright JM Barrie, I was expecting that Depp would be a man searching for a child's imagination, but he finds so much more, with the love and compassion of a child unfolding in him throughout his performance. Perhaps what he does best in this film is he does not steal any scenes, instead acting as more of a vehicle for the subject matter. Seeing this movie made me want to watch Edward Scissorhands again, as Depp really seems to have built on that subtle style of his, and found brilliance in this movie.If you want to find a parallel for Kate Winslet's role in Finding Neverland, just think of a woman in a desperate situation, who has a very pushy mother, who finds somebody that opens up a new world of possibilities. Of course, as we have seen in Titanic, Winslet is perfectly capable of playing such a role. But, like her co-star, she goes beyond mere capability in this film, and again it is done through interaction and subtlety, as opposed to overpowering speeches and ""heavy"" emoting.Of course this interaction which is carried out so wonderfully by Depp and Winslet cannot exist without a strong supporting cast. To have four children do such a wonderful job as the actors who played Sylvia's (Kate Winslet's) sons, is a genuine treat to see.As for the story, it is quite simply about finding Neverland, as the characters each endeavour to find their own Neverland in their own way, no matter how great or small. If you want to find it, if you're an adult who still takes to daydreaming, or if you just like the story of Peter Pan, then you will probably enjoy this film as I did.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
On second thought...,"I submitted a commentary, since deleted, on 'Finding Neverland' after I first saw it. Now I've seen it again and have altered my initial opinion substantially. The first viewing left me feeling a bit bored, albeit intrigued, and finally moved, as the makers intended me to be. I was charmed, and that's not a bad thing. Upon second viewing I am confirmed in my earlier suspicions that there is much less to this movie than meets the eye, mind or heart.I was, and still am, impressed by Johnny Depp who turns in yet another fine performance, delivering his lines with a natural Scottish brogue. There are other fine performances, notably Kelly MacDonald's Peter Pan. Kate Winslet is a fine actress and does what she can with the one-dimensional character written for her. And it's good to see Julie Christie still at her most acerbic. I sensed she was holding in laughter the whole time for some reason. She plays a tinsel gorgon and seems to not really believe in the character's motivations. This isn't surprising as none of the characters seem to evolve out of any sort of authentic human spark. They are all cardboard cutouts. The usual portrayal of ""uptight"" Victorians as seen by Hollywood is in full evidence. Even the children are too clean, their little pranks and fights all choreographed and careful. Fortunately the four Davies boys are played by fairly natural actors who are happily free of cuteness or obnoxious precociousness. Young Michael is especially engaging. The focus boy, Peter, is too glum by half but well acted.The story is interesting but has not been brought very effectively to the screen in this movie. It's a surprisingly ""down"" film with little humor. It has charm of a Disney-esquire nature but it rings false most of the time. The writer has attempted to manipulate emotions from the viewer, leaving one feeling a bit conned in the end.I can't put my finger on it other than to say something went awry in the conceptualization meetings in pre-production. A wrong turn was taken somewhere and the result is an oddly shallow and predictable charade. A high-tech panto for adults.It's all a pity because the cast is very good. The technical side, of which the production team seemed especially proud of themselves in the ""special feature"" sections on the DVD, is also good. But that's what this film feels like, a show-off piece for fancy camera/ computer work and cleverly edited scenes. The movie flows like a very shallow rivulet when I really would have liked a more deeply flowing river. Charles Sturridge did it better in 'A Fairy Tale' and without the blatant emotional manipulation.I didn't dislike 'Finding Neverland' but I think I'll just read the play 'Peter Pan' next time.But then there is Johnny Depp's Barrie and Kelly MacDonald's Peter Pan that will probably charm me back to the DVD again.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Quite Possibly the Best Movie version of Peter Pan ever made,"It's weird when I have nothing to complain about, about a movie. But this movie succeeded. The acting, production values and story were spellbinding. It's odd when a movie today makes you feel anything today and this movie will make you laugh, think (God forbid) and even cry. It's that good.It also captures the essence of J.M. Barrie's vision better than all previous attempts to date including the Disney Cartoon and the mediocre live-action film released in recent years. Freddie Highmore should now play Peter Pan in an actual movie of the character, for he captured the look and feel of the character in the book perfectly, managing not only to be merry and fun but also possessing a slightly sinister, sadder quality underneath.Wait, I do have one complaint.

A touch of magic...and some inspired performances...it soars like a kite...,"A behind the scenes look at a portion of James M. Barrie's life is given the sort of superb visuals one expects from high quality British films of this sort. The magic is there when the story reaches the part about Barrie's inspiration for ""Peter Pan"". From then on, the film soars like a kite into an enchanted land.What I wasn't prepared for was the fact that the story takes a sadder turn when dealing with Barrie's relationship with the widowed mother of the four boys (who, by the way, are wonderfully played by the most natural and appealing youngsters I've ever seen on film!) But the balance between laughter and tears is a nice one, finely controlled, so that at the conclusion you've been rewarded with a really satisfying piece of entertainment and a new perspective on ""Peter Pan"".The performances are all first rate, exceptional in fact. Johnny Depp continues to stretch with each role, nailing the character so perfectly that he hardly seems to be acting. The same can be said for Kate Winslet, Julie Christie (in a rather thankless but well played role), and, of course, by the magnificent child actor Freddie Highmore, who plays Peter. Not since Freddie Bartholomew has a child of this exceptional talent and appeal appeared on the screen. The chemistry between him and Depp is magical.Despite the tear-jerker elements, a film the whole family can savor and enjoy right up until the final credits. The most magical moments are the theater scenes, but the cinematography throughout on various locations is awesome.The pace is a bit slow at times but this is the film's only flaw. Most will fall under the spell of the storytelling right from the start.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Convincing Co-stars,"If you think this movie is made up of only Johnny Depp, then you'll be seriously mistaken. Never have I seen Depp being actually outshone, at times, not just by one, but by two others from the cast. No doubt his presence is commanding, but his performance alone wouldn't be substantial enough to carry the entire movie, definitely not without the outstanding efforts by Kate Winslet and Freddie Highmore.Kate Winslet has come a long way since her very prominent but not universally ""well-accepted"" role in Titanic. Frankly speaking, I thought she was crap. But she has really proved her acting credentials since then, taking on one challenging role after another. In Finding Neverland, Winslet touches hearts as a widow struggling to handle her four boys and her true feelings for the married Barrie (Depp). She brings the audiences along on her emotional journey and they in turn emphatise with her in her plight.Freddie Highmore is even more amazing; a young boy his age overshadowing the famous, Oscar-nominated Johnny Depp is truly no mean feat. Even Depp himself endorsed the massive potential this kid possesses. Forget the ""has-been"" Haley Joel Osment and the progressively irritating Dakota Fanning... this boy is the real deal. He is so matured and convincing beyond his years that you wonder if he's constantly possessed while acting. Or is he even acting? He is that scaringly good.I've concentrated purely on the extremely strong cast simply because the film is really just about those characters. Finding Neverland is a simple, uncomplicated and beautiful biopic that tells a story as pure as Peter Pan the play.Who should watch: Fans of simple story-telling through great acting; day-dreamers searching for more inspirationWho shouldn't watch: Day-dreamers who have killer bosses; better not unleash the ""potential"" and risk getting the sackRating: 8.2",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beautiful cinematographic masterpiece,"I was hoping this movie would be good though I didn't know much about it before viewing, but it exceeded every possible expectation I could have had about the movie. Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet give masterful performances, and the British children-cast does a beautiful job of making the movie believable. Dustin Hoffman of course also gives a great performance, though his character in the movie has a very minimal exposure, and is not very likable; yet Dustin again shows us he can assume any role given to him with no trouble at all.The production team did a wonderful job in mastering the final cut of the movie. It is an emotional, touching movie which is not seen often in Hollywood in recent times.Kudos to all the people who made this release truly magical! P.S.: There are a few ""tear-jerking"" moments in this film that will leave you feeling personally involved in the storyline, but also make the movie slightly more memorable.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Awe Inspiring...,"I have never posted on here, but have been a big fan of this website for quite sometime. I enjoy reading other comments, but have never posted one before, until I saw Finding Neverland. This movie left my in tears for several minutes after it ended. I watched it with friends and we were laughing at how emotional it got us. What an amazing journey this movie takes you on and it tugs at that inner child and vivid imagination we have in all all of us.Wonderfully acted, Johnny Depp is just brilliant. You are there with him, the whole time seeing what it is like to be in his head. Kate Winslet is wonderful in this movie. These two actors are simply that best we have in cinema.This is bar none the best movie I have ever seen in my life.

Great fun for those who do not prejudge,"I'm half inclined to quote Dr Johnson's comment on the Giant's Causeway - 'it is worth seeing but not worth going to see' but that would be a little bit unfair.Yes, it's a weepy, but this film does give something more. Depp is very good as JM Barrie and Winslet, for a change, neither strips nor wears a corset.The gem of this film is the child actors - they are quite magnificent and the ending had the cinema shaking with sobbing...Do not sit down to watch this with any preconceptions and you will probably enjoy it all the more. Yes, there will be those people who will complain about the accuracy of the film, but for most of us this is a pleasant romantic story with a few tears and laughs...",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I mean it's the same director, yet i wouldn't have thought that unless i looked on IMDb.

Amazing,"Johnny Depp, after this movie, is now my favorite actor. All his movies, he looks different, acts different, and even speaks differently. In his movies, I am just totally shocked. He never seizes to amaze me.This movie is on my top 10 favorite movies. But, some of his other movies are also on my top 10.The movie makes you think, that there is a kid in everybody, even grown ups. Being a kid doesn't give you the right to an imagination, it's who you are that gives you that right. In this movie, Johnny Depp, playing Sir James was given the privilege. He shows everybody what a little imagination can do.To parents, you will be influenced. To the children, you will know what the truth is behind this. Although, I'm being a hypocrite, seeing parents will probably also know the truth behind the movie.Movie, I would give it a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
What an exceptional experience it was..,First of all I just have to wonder how easily a grown man turns into a weeping little girl. All I needed was to watch Finding Neverland. It left me wondering what the heck just happened? I can't remember crying in a movie for a long long time.. First thought that crossed my mind was: how gay was that? As I read IMDb forums I found out that I wasn't the only guy who had been crying like a baby. That was comforting..That's how good Finding Neverland was. From the first moment that Barrie (Depp) started to introduce the Davis boys to the world of imagination and fairytale I was sold. Peter Pan is something we can all relate to. And maybe it's just me but I felt like the creators of this movie had captured the spirit of Peter Pan perfectly. For a moment the movie made me feel just as invincible as the book did when I was six years old. That was the greatest thing about Finding Neverland. It was once again a great lesson to remind us how important it is to never grow up. Anything that gets a grown man in a sentimental mood like that has to be great. Anyway the movie is as magnificent as hyped.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Excellent all around,"This movie was easily the greatest movie rated PG I have ever seen. The acting was phenomenal I think Johnny did a amazing job the best I have seen him do.Kate Winslet was very good, I was surprised she was not nominated for the Oscar.That kid Freddy Highmore was very good he really reminded me of Haley Joel Osment from ""The sixth sense"".Julie Christie played her part very well. I am only 14 and I usually don't like these kind of movies, but I absolutely loved this one.I know this movie won't win the Oscar for best picture but I wish it did. I have seen the other two movies everyone says will win the Oscar ""Million dollar baby"" and ""The Aviator"". They were both good but not as good as this.This was clearly a classic",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Surprising biopic,"This movie takes you through the trials and tribulations of the man who wrote one of the most recognizable stories of our time (if not the most recognizable). I found the beginning to be a bit dull, and has a lot of informative things that may not interest most people, especially children.The story does pick up however, after all of the formalities have been dealt with. This film will take you from being an adult to a child again, then suddenly wrench you back to adulthood. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has children that love the Peter Pan story, although it is a little over the standard six or seven year old's head.I will admit that this movie can make the tears come forth, not so much as to cause a room full of balling babies, but they're there. This tale will take you to places that you have not been since childhood, it can cause a great deal of memories to come flooding back after it has finished (though I may be in a bias position, certain things in it ring very close to home for me) I would have to guess that this film will win best picture.What can one say about Johnny Depp... splendid performance as usual, however, the most commanding performance was not by someone we all know! It was by a young man named Freddie Highmore, not since ""The Sixth Sense"" (Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear) have I seen an actor so young land their role so perfectly.I give ""Finding Neverland"" a 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Believe the hype-it's true!,"I'm not surprised. Why you ask? Johnny Depp proved me wrong for like the 100th time! 6 months back when I constantly overlooked this movie in any film magazine, I kept thinking to myself ""is Hollywood that desperate for new movie ideas?"". Then it got multiple nominations, and then I was like ""is the academy made up of kids?!"". But now after seeing the movie (and not so reluctantly, I actually eventually gave in to some of the hype) I can assuredly say this is definitely a movie not worth missing. I won't go to the length of saying ""it's the best movie ever!"" but will contently admit that I was wrong for ever doubting this movie and it's merit. If you aren't a stranger to drama and don't mind a little bit of ""imagination"" don't hesitate when you see your hand reaching for it at the movie store.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A great ""new"" director","First of all, I like the work of Mr.Deep. I saw many movies with him and always great movies and ""Deadman"" is one of my favorites. Now I can go on.I will saw this movie because of Mr.Deep, but also I'm was curious about the man who create Peter Pan. As a 47 old man Dysney's Peter Pan was very important when I was a child, but as a composer and writer, I'm an always curious about the creative process behind each master piece and the life of the creators.Finding Neverland was one of those movies when I lost the floor or pull my carpet. I was not prepared to see something like that. Create is a delicate process. Many times I discovered myself drowned in inner thoughts while reality around me continuous gives me feedback, but it seems I'm not connected. I saw all of that in the big screen.There are few movies without murders, blood, fear or sex today. It's difficult to see and to tell a story about real people and the great here is the mix of reality and dream, like a child playing. I don't like to use the word ""great"" a lot, but sensibility is the key. The world seems to lost it's own. The old ones forgot to play, to dream and to share.Mr.Marc Foster had the ability to give us all of this in a movie that seems simple. A movie where the special effects don't block the view from the story. I remembered the delicate movies of Truffaut and others European directors.Mr.Deep was great as the dreamer, the obstinate writer and builder of a bridge between dream and reality and also as the man, not so fragile as in other roles.I can't remember about a movie in the last years when I have no words immediately after the end. I stayed with my wife seeing the credits (as usually we do) but we don't want to leave the room. We wanted to stay and see it again, but reality knocks our door and we return from a deep dive. Three hours after seeing it I'm still moved. It seems I know a bit more about myself after this movie and I didn't feel something like that since my 20's.Nice feelings...great feelings.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

This one was by far the most beautiful film of the year; the cinematography was awesome. This was lost in the cracks as a victim of the obvious politics that is in Hollywood!! Very disappointing results.What was equally frustrating about it not receiving more recognition by the Academy was that for a long time now there have not been very many movies that meet the interest of a wide audience...this one could be appreciated by all ages. Another appealing aspect of this film was that it allowed all of us to return to our childhood innocence and get so absorbed in fantasy that we were allowed to escape the woes of our not so innocent reality.

Better Than Expected!,"Finding Neverland is a really great, powerful family film that discusses the life of J.M Barrie and his inspiration for Peter Pan. I never thought much of this film in the past despite positive reviews and Academy recognition. But I should have because it's sweet, heart-warming, emotional, and a perfect example of a family film. I would have never thought that the director of this film, Marc Forster would go on to direct a James Bond film.Forster's film is about a failing playwright named J.M Barrie. He meets this family of a woman and her three kids as he is sitting in the park. He becomes great friends with this family and little did he know how this changed his life for the better and created a story so magical, that many children around the world cherish the beloved Peter Pan.Johnny Depp is really good in the film. This is a departure from his other roles of Jack Sparrow or Edward Scissorhands. He shows why he's better than people give him credit for. The guy knows how to act. Kate Winslet is really good as the mother and Julie Christie is great as the stern mother of Winslet. However, Freddie Highmore deserves the highest credit in his role of Peter.Overall, this is a very heartwarming story of a man who invented one of the most famous childhood figures of all time. I shouldn't have doubted this film but this is a true example of a biography. It's one of those rare ones that are safe for kids. I really loved this film and it will remain in my heart for years to come. I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Finding Neverland is a new look at an old story,"While browsing around the video store, I came across this movie which I've heard much acclaim about but had no true interest in viewing. But then so small voice said go ahead and pick-it-up, so I did just that,maybe sometimes its good to listen to the voices in your head, this one lead me to a purchase a movie, which took me on a journey. To that magical, mystical land that all of us have dreamed of one day finding. This movie is not at all a remake of the same old story of the boy who never grow up. No, this is a story about how that story came to be. In a wonderful fashion Finding Neverland takes you on that journey, and you don't even know that your going, but by some magic you a whisked away into that world of endless summers of your youth. When this ride is over Neverland will be there before you, and around you will be those carefree days of yesteryear. OK maybe this is a bit dramatic.

Finding Neverland made me feel emotions that I either have never felt before, or that I haven't in a very long time. It is safe to say that it changed my life. I won't add any spoilers...but this movie is a must see for everyone. If it doesn't make you feel, then I think it is fair to say that you don't have a soul.

The power of imagination,"One of the strengths in this movie about the author of Peter Pan is that no characters are so exaggerated put to screen that they couldn't have existed. Emma du Maurier is not an over-evil character; she gives Barrie a difficult time, but has her reasons and in the end even apologizes. Barrie is instructed to be cautious in his relation with the Davies' family at the cricket match in a subtle way. Mary supports her husband to a great extent despite their problems. In Disney's hands there would be no hesitation to remove this balance in story and characters. Note also however that the actual story around the Davies' family and Barrie is completely different and almost the opposite of what is portrayed here.The writing of Peter Pan, inspired by the Davies' family, offers Barrie a way to deal with his marriage trouble at home and a suffocating British society in general. Parallel we have Peter's coping with his father's death to be the reason he starts writing, inspired by Barrie. When Peter's play is performed, the upcoming illness of his mother throws him back from his imagined world to the real world. The scene in the end with the entering of Neverland is the best in the movie, especially the quick edit after-wards.The direction is a relatively weak point as Marc Forster (Monster's Ball) could have used some more imagination on a story about the power of imagination. Yes, he weaves in real and imagined images, but that's the only (visual) trick on offer.Johnny Depp is building a whole new career with sugary movies: Chocolat, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and this sugar sweet one. It is an enormous contrast with the wild roles he took on some years earlier.Finding Neverland is a decent movie, see it if it's the kind of story you generally appreciate.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Movie About How We Love,"Let's start with the idea that there are numerous biographies of J. M. Barrie, as there are of many other famous writers. Barrie is pretty much known for ""Peter Pan"" and little else. If asked about his personal life, could any of you come up with anything about him. So what happens here is a fictional account of the writer, making him a bit of an irresponsible boy (a lost boy?). While bouncing around with his writing and failing here and there, he one day come upon a widow and her four boys. Because children are so much to him, he begins to get to know the boys. His interactions help them (with one exception) diminish their sorrow over the death of their father. He also begins to befriend the young widow. The whole story is touching. I won't do anything to spoil the ending. Just to say that it is touching. It's a movie about love and sacrifice and it's beautifully done.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The pain corner of awareness.,"He is always behind so many coats, hats, hairstyles and variations of powder, that I felt almost cringing how exposed Johnny Depp was. Somehow it felt brave. Yet it is brave; in repression in imagination, that shows the universe 'inside' encapsulates an entire theater of similar whimsy and magnitude. Its key exploring Barrie's romantic identity, though I'd conclude it's a small reading is its point, but one it makes a point in addressing. Basically because...the inside-outside is that romance and art functions as the same repression-expression, In stories... art, love and nature are always the enlightenment. So the film's initial basis is JM Barrie's motive so it's not unfair ground to conclude there is something there. Of course his nobility is its 'out' in showing him as harmless and longing to tap into purity and innocence sprung from pretentious bores being of use to no one. (Give the audience what they don't know they want.) But I could not ignore what the film itself was putting down: literally the couples retreat into different bedrooms not together; her into shadows, him into enlightened isolation of the mind. You can read that as imagination as proxy for the romantic, or you could read the impulse of love channeling into grand visions instead, as a pursuit beyond human understanding, as channeling the divine. ""Be disciplined and reserved in life so you can be savage in your work."" His presence then is healing and therapeutic by exposing them to this 'enlightenment.' See how the boy's emotional breakdown is destroying 'art.' The brave. ""This isn't one of your plays."" Sometimes Hollywood is so on the nose it achieves great insight. ""I've only wanted good things for this family."" Julie Christie wonders 'why'; -- from her perspective, he comes in, riots the children, kills the mother, for his own selfish pursuit. AKA the eternal as framing the inward through ritual therapy is uncomfortable for the repressed. ""The boy is gone."" It comes at a cost. See the consequences of 'art' as ritual payment for actualization. But the opposite is death by silence. Every one of them is envious of what Barrie has. See how her illness on opening night like cramping birthing pains. Art operates as this same inevitable force as life and death. How about the wonder of Dustin Hoffman's character being the second half of the spell. He doesn't understand 'why' but is deeply driven to do it. Both are so prim, proper and fashionable for 'why' requires our utmost. Notice how he never, ever intervenes. (The quotation of Hoffman as Captain Hook and Depp as Jack Sparrow were great.) As vivid and exciting as that feeling of something happening across it, the sorrowful sobering note it ends on is brave; the fade-out in Neverland with end text would have left a fine conclusion, but the film is interested in imparting the entire spectrum of wisdom, including art as both coming up short, as in it's not a process in therapy for the pains of living, but a form of living itself.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

It was beautiful to look at without being self-conscious, and the acting was superb, not only (as expected)the leads, but what a joy to see Julie Christie so splendid in her maturity. Likewise the four boys were terrific, as were the old lady who played Mrs Snow and the young lady who played Peter Pan.

What happened at the Oscars?,"I was in another country for some time and hadn't had the pleasure of seeing many of the Oscar nominated films this past year. Watching this film I laughed, cried and torn through several mixtures of the two. So I can only imagine politics played a behind the scenes part of why this powerful and well scripted and photographed film fell short on the big night. I applaud the winners and fellow nominees but still remain disappointed this gem was lost among all else. Whatever the reason, the Academy missed how it was beautifully brought to life, of course by Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, but also Freddie Highmore. This actor is as talented as he is young, definitely someone to watch for in the upcoming Willy Wonka also with Depp. Neverland had all the right parts for a great story, but sometimes it takes the child within to look past the adult business of success.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastic Movie About Simply Believing,"You've probably heard the commotion over Finding Neverland, the story of how J.M. Barrie created the classic tale of Peter Pan. Well, any positive commotion over the movie you have heard is true. The acting is fantastic by adults and children alike and the story is, without a doubt, fantastic and adventurous. J.M. Barrie (Depp), playwright, has written a play. It does not get good reviews by the people. One day in the park he meets 4 boys by the names of Peter, Jack George and Michael and their mother Sylvia (Winslet). She is widow due to the death of her husband. He develops a friendly relationship with the boys and their mother and is what inspires him to write the great play called Peter Pan, the story of a boy who never wanted to grow up. This movie is enjoyable and will be well liked by people of all ages. It may be a bit hard for younger children to understand, but there is no doubt they will find it entertaining.

simple and Magical!,"It takes a lot for a film to make me cry, and this one did! Finding Neverland is film that is very rare in today's main stream cinema. Although it has a couple of special effects shots the story is primary. When I first saw the film I had brought a cast of 50 from a production of Peter Pan I was co-directing. When asked to clap if we believed in fairies the whole cinema did. The film is so simple but powerful and to me this is the true magic of film. For two hours we are allowed to escape from the fast moving modern world of today and relax in a place were the inner child can smile. The cast all give excellent performances and the film's direction is great. We all know the story of Peter Pan but watching this film you will discover how rare and truly inspirational it is.

Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet...do i need to say more?,"Johnny Depp is probably one of the most diverse actors of his generation. Just his name has become a brand of quality because when you see his name on a poster for a movie, you now it will be worth it. The same thing can be said about the always beautiful Kate Winslet but i don't need to mention many films to make you understand that she is one of the greatest actresses around. For example she was amazing in The Reader and Titanic but that's just the top of the iceberg. Finding Neverland is a very well done and mostly very carefully directed movie. This could be a mix of many things, we are talking about a package that includes; drama, comedy, interesting subjects and a truly amazing character study with a little doze of fantasy.The story is fantastic, both beautiful and charming. The acting is brilliant but that is of course expected when you look at the main actors, Depp completely fits into his role and shows that he can easily be a serious actor and Winslet shines like always. Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman give us entertaining, maybe not playful performances. The technical side of it but specially the cinematography really pays of for this movie and it looks great. The best way to describe Finding Neverland is that it's a very confident film, something that the whole family could enjoy. It's lovely to see how the entertainment value flows through the whole movie and you never really feel bored. Only thing i can say bad about the films is how the ending is so cliché. I do realize that we are talking about a movie that is built on a true story but the drama just doesn't reach enough height to give us a more delicate ending.8/10 - I completely recommend this film just because of Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Rigging The Ballot Box,"A naked attempt at having it both ways: Oscar contention, and the commercial need to fill the seats with a child audience (bulldozed into this narrative).Huge disappointment because of the lack of imagination. No exploitation of the times, the Edwardian architecture.Neverland itself is visually imagined no more deeply than a play, as stage sets, right down to the undulating cardboard cutouts that make up the ""sea"".This couples with the narrative hypocrisy: Peter Pan is all about NOT growing up, and yet this entire story is crushed by the baggage about growing up: Depp in his relationship to his wife, the eldest boy in relation to the grandmother, young Peter in relation to the world.Depp is on target, Winslet is miscast, Hoffman is his usual nattering self...his own turn at Hook was better, a scary concept.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

The accent was perfect, never faltered. I thought Kate Winslet did a great job as well. In fact, I think her performance was Oscar-worthy, same with Johnny Depp. Julie Christie was so nasty! She was perfectly cast - actually, the entire movie was perfectly cast.The children were just adorable. I just wanted to pinch Michael's cheeks.I cried the last 20 minutes of the movie.

"A mother's wish, a little boy's dream, a world of imagination...","I've never been a big fan of Johnny Depp and I never fell into the ""Pirates..."" saga, but he pulls one out of the hat in this world of make believe that comes to life with just a hint of imagination.Depp plays J M Barrie, the author of ""Peter Pan."" After a flop on his last play, he stumbles upon a woman and her children in the park, where he strikes up a friendship with them (under the un-approving eye of society) and forms a bond with the children, thus basing the book on the many adventures he takes with the children.A little bit of knowledge of the lore of the book is a must, otherwise you'll never understand what's going on. Even I, myself, have never realized the connections the book had with real life, such as the crocodile chasing Captain Hook while harboring a ticking clock in his stomach, signifying how time catches up with all of us.A touching movie and one I don't think I'll be able to top for a long time. I feel cheated, because it's taken me 3 years to see it! 9 out of 10!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Charming, Well-Acted, Nice Formula....","I thought Finding Neverland was very good overall. Yes, it is one of this year's best, and Johnny Depp continues to be one of my favorite actors. It was charming and well acted, but I was not overwhelmingly impressed. The strength of this film is the enchanting telling of a story based on ""true"" events. The novelty lies in the interweaving of the real life story with the fantasy story of ""Peter Pan"", and since it is a fictional story about the development of a fictional story, I just did not find it that brilliant or innovative in the many references to the well known children's story. It kind of reminded me of the film formula of ""Shakespeare in Love"" (about the behind the scenes development of Romeo and Juliet) or the lesser known ""Dreamchild"" (about the development of Alice in Wonderland) or even ""Santa Clause The Movie"" (about the whole Santa mythos). It was well acted, particularly by Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, and the kid that played ""Peter"", his performance alone might elicit tears. Probably because of Kate Winslet and the late Victorian costuming, I was reminded of one of those Merchant/Ivory E.M. Forster English parlour dramas which seems to lend it a more sophisticated art-house ambiance. I would recommend it, but I think it would be just as enjoyable at home on DVD. Also, would I need to see it over and over (the true test of a future classic)? .....honestly, no.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A masterpiece,Marc Forster has directed a gem here.No doubt the movie is a bit slow but what overcomes it is the great acting & evergreen soundtrack.Johnny Depp & Kate Winslet have given a riveting performance.A performance that will surely get to you.Dustin Hoffman also performs a great role in the movie.The kids in the film are pretty good.They have done a tremendous job here.The plot is a play-writer finds shade in a family as he begins dreaming about his novel & writes a beautiful play called The Peter Pan.The children & their mother Kate are his inspiration.But something tragic happens in the end.But Depp makes Kate feel what she meant to him.The soundtrack is fabulous.So Finding Neverland is a pretty good film to watch.A family movie.A masterpiece!!,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Moving Period Piece,"I just saw this film for the first time last night and was quite pleasantly surprised. Overwhelmingly so in fact. Knowing a little bit about the true history of Sir J.M. Barrie and yet comparatively little about ""Finding Neverland"" other than its Oscar hoopla, I expected the film to focus largely on the often controversial life of a man deemed capricious, anomic, and asexual by many historians, with the inception of Peter Pan as a backdrop perhaps. Instead the film celebrates Barrie's brilliant vision of what would become a timeless tale and cultural staple for the ages, and the power of imagination that we all possess and, if willing, are able to unleash. It celebrates the whimsical, the eccentric, and the ""silliness"" which make life, even in the stilted atmosphere of Victorian London, worth living. The film is both an artistic period piece and a rich character study (though not a biography), and features some of the best and most convincing performances from child actors in recent memory. Depp is brilliant as usual and Dustin Hoffman as his tightly wound producer/financier also makes for one of the more enjoyable, though secondary, characters to watch. The film starts somewhat slowly but seamlessly evolves into an engrossing and emotionally engaging story which unlike many other critically acclaimed dramas wrought of style over substance, is unquestionably worthy of its high praise. It has both the substance, as well as a style all its own, and should make even the most jaded and cynical viewer well up a little bit. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A True Story Film That Needed More Work,This true story film did not really capture what it was really about. The crew missed creating this film. The storyline was a bit simple and it did not have enough to tell viewers what this true story film was about. It was disappointing. Some parts throughout this film did not make any sense. The cast selection could have been stronger. They did not exactly fully commit nor connect to the storyline and neither to their respective characters. It was straightforward. It was confusing. The chemistry between that the cast members displayed between each other was weak. It did not work for this true story film.,1.0,Anonymous,Biography
strong performances,"Johnny Depp gives one of his most subtle performances to date in ""Finding Neverland,"" a film about the creative process that has a thing or two to say about the part imagination plays in all our lives. In this adaptation of the play by Allan Knee, Depp plays J.M. Barrie, the author who, in 1904, introduced the world to Peter Pan. According to the movie (though not necessarily reality), Barrie gleaned the inspiration for his creation from a beautiful young widow and her four sons whom he met one day in the park and with whom he forged a deep and lasting relationship (there are a few factual errors in that synopsis, but in the interest of keeping your confusion to a minimum, I'll recount the story as the movie presents it). In his endeavors to entertain the children, Barrie brought them into his world of magical make believe, eventually weaving the story of Peter Pan out of those experiences.When we first meet Barrie, he is already a well-known and successful playwright in the London theater world - although his latest work has bored his audience and critics so thoroughly in its premiere performance that it is forced to close on opening night. Suffering from creative stagnation and stuck in a stifling marriage, Barrie eventually finds surcease and an outlet for his creativity with his new-found ""family"" from the park. However, even though the film technically takes place in the Edwardian Era, the iron hand of Victorian Era morality still holds England firmly in its icy grip. For soon rumors are flying not only about the ""unseemly"" relationship between Barrie and Mrs. Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, but even about the questionable and potentially sinister nature of Barrie's relationship with the boys.Written by David Magee and directed by Marc Foster, ""Finding Neverland"" offers a touching, fascinating glimpse into the mind of a man in the process of creating one of the most enduring tales of modern literature. One of the marks of any ""classic"" work of inspiration - be it art, music, literature or drama - is that we are never aware of the nuts-and-bolts process that has gone into its creation. The greater the work, the more we are inclined to believe that it dropped fully formed from heaven, a rare gift from the gods that seems somehow always to have existed somewhere. That is certainly the case with ""Peter Pan,"" which is why ""Finding Neverland"" provides such an invaluable service. It forces us to acknowledge that even the greatest of creations, which we tend to attribute to that mysterious and intangible entity known as ""genius,"" are really the product of one part inspiration to two parts fortuitous timing and hard work. ""Finding Neverland"" flows effortlessly between the events as they happened in real life and the fantasy scenarios that Barrie eventually wove out of them to create his masterpiece. As a result, the movie itself has a kind of heightened fairy tale feel to it that works well in the context of the story. The movie also affords us an entertaining behind-the-scenes view of the creation of the play itself and a breathless recreation of its opening night.In addition to Depp, the film is filled with fine performances by Kate Winslet as Sylvia, Julie Christie as her stern, disapproving mother, Dustin Hoffman as Barrie's sympathetic theater manager, and Radha Mitchell, as Barrie's cold, status-conscious wife. The four young actors who play the boys are also excellent, with Freddie Highmore, as the precocious and too-cynical-for-his-own-good Peter, a particular standout.Historians may find room to quibble about some of the liberties the film takes with the facts. Sylvia was not a widow at the time of the story and her husband resented the intrusion of Barrie into their lives. Even one of the sons has been dropped. This is acceptable, however, since an over-cluttered plot would likely have robbed the film of the simplicity it needs to sustain its fairy tale ambiance. Moreover, the movie telescopes a number of key events to enhance their dramatic impact (i.e. his wife's affair with writer Gilbert Cannan, which is shown as being a contemporaneous event, actually occurred a number of years after this part of the story). But such nitpicking seems fruitless in the overall scheme of the film.Was Peter Llewelyn Davies the real inspiration for Peter Pan or was it J.M. Barrie himself? The film doesn't answer that question, but it certainly hints at the distinct possibility of the latter. For Barrie was clearly a man who much preferred the warm fantasies of carefree childhood to the cold cynicism of responsible adulthood. And that, of course, has always been the heart and soul - as well as the life's blood - of his own paean to eternal youth, ""Peter Pan.""",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Perfect!,"Finding Neverland is the story of how struggling playwright J. M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) created Peter Pan, inspired by an equally struggling widow (Kate Winslet) and her four rambunctious boys. Exquisitely detailed, with sumptuous and elaborate set pieces, Marc Forster's filming of the Allan Knee play is artful without being arty.Johnny Depp is perfectly cast as Barrie, although there's the usual caveat that Johnny Depp is perfectly cast in almost anything. He might well be the best actor working today, especially since he refuses to let himself become typecast. Hard to believe now that he used to be on that old Fox TV show, isn't it? Depp is dead-on earnest as the wise, soulful Barrie, who becomes a sort-of surrogate father to the four Davies boys, whose father has since passed away (although in real life he hadn't yet died when Barrie met the family).Although the movie is about the creation of Peter Pan, at its heart are smaller dovetailing storythreads about relationships, particularly those between Barrie and his wife, Mary (Radha Mitchell), Barrie and Sylvia Davies (Winslet), and Barrie and the youngest Davies boy, Peter (Freddie Highmore). Depp's mastery of expression and pathos are on display here, as he turns in an utterly commanding, pitch-perfect performance; his Oscar nomination for this role was well deserved indeed.Depp is supported by an excellent cast that looks like it's been performing the roles for years. In particular, Winslet and Mitchell were magnificent, as was the venerable Julie Christie, who plays Sylvia's mother Mrs. Emma du Maurier. Dustin Hoffman turns in decent work as Charles Frohman, the proprietor of the playhouse in which Barrie's plays were performed (in other words, his patron). As Depp is now, Hoffman was long known for being able to disappear into a role - his roles in the 1970s alone are mighty eclectic indeed.This is a sheer beauty to behold, a movie that should certainly stand the test of time to be regarded in a few decades as a true classic. Your jaw will drop at some of the set pieces on display - check out the pirate ship! - and you'll marvel at the jaunty forays into the imagination of the playwright who never grew up. Finding Neverland will have even the most jaded and heartless melting and shimmering with pure, unadulterated joy.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

I loved it.,"I wouldn't dare presume to tell people what they are and are not going to like. I'm going to instead describe what I like. I love the imagination in this film. I love it that Johnny Depp is acting like the 40-year-old he is, and I think he's matured beautifully as an actor. As someone who doesn't speak with a British accent, he nonetheless had me convinced he was Irish or Scottish or whatever he was supposed to be. Compared to Jodie Foster's trying to be British in the otherwise wonderful ""The King and I"", Mr. Depp was fabulous. I loved the Tim Burtonish touches in this film that reminded me so much of another wonderful movie, ""Big Fish"". And the children. What wonderful children, especially young Freddie. As the trivia section suggests, the screenwriter took some artistic license with the truth; but since when has the truth gotten in the way of a good story? I have no idea what the criteria are for Oscar films; but I wouldn't be surprised if this were a contender, even though I want ""Ray"" to win.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Beautiful, Touching and Enchanting","I loved this movie, it is definitely worth watching. Johnny Depp, is without a doubt one of the best actors around.. The movie starts out harmless and you would never think that it will touch and move the heart the way it does.. I'm going to be honest, I had to shed some tears. I was very moved by the atmosphere the director had created, the wonderful acting of the children in the movie, the emotional struggle of the Davies family, the colorful scenery and the whole setting.This movie is definitely a must. Take the time and let Sir James Matthew Barrie draw you into his fantasy. The Highligh of the movie is a young boy named Freddie Highmore who plays the role of Peter, which inspires J.M.

A Fairy Tale Wrapped in a Wish,"I've never been a big Depp fan... I still think ""21 jump street"" and shudder. I was pleasantly thrilled , therefore, to see him in a commanding performance as Sir James Matthew Barrie in the movie. It is by far his best feat of acting and quite possibly will earn him a nomination. The direction of the film was well played out and had no loss of continuity. Also it was quite artfully done. The soundtrack enhanced and did not overpower the scenes as is common in many modern films.My only complaints about the film were the lack of subplots that were vastly hinted at. A more involved level of conflict between Mrs. Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie) and James would have been welcomed and lent some depth to all of the characters involved. The resolution of the film seemed a bit hastily done after the gentle expanding of the plot up to that point. One wonders if the deleted scenes that will be present on the DVD will add more flavor to the film... in fact I wonder if the deleted scenes or any subplots were actually planned by the filmmakers in advance... to further DVD sales.A must see in the theatre.

The best movie I've seen all year,"Granted, I haven't seen all of the critically heralded films of 2004, but I believe this would stay my favorite no matter how good the others turn out to be. The magic and wonder of this story captured me from the very first moment that Barrie meets the boys and gives them his dancing bear show.J.M. Barrie (real-life author of Peter Pan (please tell me you've heard of it) played by Johnny Depp in the film) is a playwright whose last play was not up to his usual snuff, most likely due to his lack of inspiration from his life with his wife, Mary (Radha Mitchell). Seeking solitude and ideas, Barrie goes for a walk in the park where me meets Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (a widow, Kate Winslet) and her children, a meeting that sparks many more meetings and imaginative games that inspire the story of Peter Pan.The cinematography is spectacular. Director Marc Forster makes excellent choices with the camera that seem to play along with the screenplay and the score. These three elements work together quite well and turn a simple story into a masterpiece. There are a few times when I felt I was being rushed through certain parts, but the movie makes up for it with it's incredible cast.After seeing Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean, I was shocked to see how well he can underplay a character. Depp gives an already poignant character and even more strikingly poignant manner with every inflection, movement, and look. Kate Winslet is equally touching, and while she does not have as much to do as Depp, she matches his talent with brilliant skill of her own. Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman give good turns as Sylvia's mother and the producer of Barrie's play, respectively.I think the player that the critics have sinfully underrated is Radha Mitchell. I barely read any praise for her wonderful job as Barrie's wife in any review when she deserves just as much as Depp or Winslet.This is a moving story that everyone should be subjected to, no matter what age or mindset. Man, I loved this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful Movie,"What can I say...is there a word I can use to describe this movie after the end credits are coming on screen...yes there is.WONDERFUL is that word.In a nutshell Finding Neverland shows the audience how the Peter Pan story was created. This movie showed me and anyone that knows anything about acting that Johnny Depp must get an Academy Award for Best Actor sooner or later. Sooner would be better. This movie was wonderfully written and directed from start to finish. Kate Winslet did an excellent job. Johnny Depp, as usual, was superb. He just becomes his character no matter who it may be. Believe it or not though..it wasn't Johnny Depp's acting that I was talking about after the movie(well...a little)but instead it was a young actor that I was seeing for the first time by the name of Freddie Highmore. He appeared very comfortable in the role. He was just as enjoyable to watch as Mr.Depp. Excellent work young Freddie Highmore.If you want to sit down one evening and watch a nice family movie with good acting and story telling...don't bypass Finding Neverland. By the way...if you're a sentimental person...be prepared for the last two/three scenes. Touching is an understatement.Have the tissues ready. I can see a lot of ladies crying during these scenes.

Anyway, I thought the movie was fantastic...The art, the story, the transitions between reality and fantasy, and the acting. I was extremely surprised at the children's acting abilities, and I thought that the boy who played Peter was wonderful. Depp's accent was a surprise at first, but I got used to it and actually began to enjoy it. The art was wonderful, and the pirate ship scene was amazing. As for the transitions, I felt that they were very well done, especially when Barrie (Depp) was questioning the boys about becoming pirates.

Finding Your Bliss,"Winslet keeps getting better with age, and of course Johnny Depp is his usual, top-notch best. British actress Julie Christie plays the seemingly evil 'Captain Hook' grandmother, Mrs. Du Maurier, who tries to prevent a social scandal among the upper-crust Londoner set; Johnny Depp's character, J.M. Barrie, ingratiates himself on a widow (Du Maurier's daughter) and her four children.The scandal involves the fact that Barrie is already married, and that--from Victorian society's perspective--the close relationship that develops between Barrie and the young boys is... suspicious, to say the least. But there is no such ulterior motives afoot: Barrie develops a healthy, platonic bond with Mrs. Davies and her children... and innocence and love reign supreme.Obviously, the widow Mrs. Davies (played by Winslet) is the inspiration (or corollary) for the 'Wendy' character in Barrie's play/novel ""Peter Pan,"" but this is just my personal hunch. The viewer of this tear-jerking gem will have to do the research for him- or herself. Finally, it is not surprising to know that this film was nominated for several Academy Awards.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Touching story and performances..,"The master of the perfect accent, Johnny Depp, leaped onto the big screen again this year in the immensely successful Finding Neverland. While the film's title may lead some to poke fun, with the Michael Jackson trial in full swing, this movie is nothing to laugh at. It is a touching look at the life of J.M. Barrie, the playwright behind the legendary Peter Pan.The film follows Barrie as he struggles to complete the story and production of Peter Pan. Along the way, he meets up with a widowed mother (Kate Winslet) and her young sons. Barrie helps one of the boys, an introverted youngster played by Freddie Highmore, discover his joy for writing and life. Through the boys, Barrie finds the inspiration for his next play. Through Barrie, the boys re-discover the father figure they lost years ago.Finding Neverland tugs at all strings. At any time it can be funny, touching, poignant or agonizing. The goal of the story is to pull at your emotions and the film succeeds in every way. While all aspects of this movie were very successful, it's the performances by the actors that put it over the top.Depp earned - and I do mean earned - yet another best actor Academy Award nomination for his performance as J.M. Barrie. Despite the fact that he was nominated last year for his role in Pirates of the Caribbean, the committee had no choice but to give him his second straight nod. After being snubbed by the Academy for several roles in the 1990s, including Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and especially Donnie Brasco, he's finally getting his just desserts as an actor.Winslet also turns in a heart-wrenching performance as Sylvia Davies, an ill-stricken, single mother of four. Pair this role with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Winslet managed to turn in a year of performances in 2004 that most actresses would love to have in a lifetime.In addition to Depp and Winslet, 12-year-old Freddie Highmore burst onto the screen in Finding Neverland as perhaps the next great child actor. In fact, Highmore was so good playing one of Davies' four sons that acclaimed director Tim Burton decided to cast him alongside Depp again this summer. He is set to play Charlie Bucket in a new version of Roald Dahl's children's novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, due out in July.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Heart-warming escape from reality,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, as even though it turned out to be entirely different from what the title suggested to me, it was an amazing story of fantasy blended with a degree of reality. The movie is based around the idea that a brilliant man, Sir James Barrie played by Johnny Depp, brought his failing career as a playwright back to life with a children's play inspired by a family he meets by chance one day in the park. The beginning drags a little as everything seems cheery and there is no conflict at all, but luckily Depp's acting is so great that he holds the interest of the audience until the story moves onto more exciting events and revelations.I was slightly disappointed in the way that many of the characters had been written and can only assume that the stereotypical traits they displayed were incorporated so that young children could more easily follow the story without being distracted by complex characters. However, this assumption goes against the fact that 'Finding Neverland' is a fairytale for grownups. The issues it deals with are more suited to a mature audience: dealing with heartbreak and loss, the notion of 'growing up' and being expected to shoulder responsibility rather than enjoy a carefree life, as well as the idea that the mind is a powerful tool and imagination limited only to each individual.Johnny Depp stands out as the star of the show, and was the perfect choice for the role of a grown man who remains a passionate child at heart. I was also very impressed with the final 'production' of Peter Pan within the movie. The sets were astonishing and really made you believe that what you were seeing was real, in a way similar to the effect created by earlier scenes where we saw through the eyes of the main character. I have high praise for the young girl who played the role of Peter Pan within the play, as her belief in what she was saying came through convincingly without the overdone acting so common with inexperienced actors/actresses.Overall this film was charming with the innocence of a childlike mind and I found myself in tears during the final few scenes as my emotions, which had been subtly manipulated over the course of the film, rose to such a level that I felt pain as if I were one of the characters in the story myself.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
I recommend it.,"I have never been disappointed with a Depp movie, and all the performances in this film add to the the rich texture of the film. My criteria for a film I would recommend to others are that it provide characters that you care about, and that the performances be believable. This movie does that and more. There are wonderful costumes, a good story (romanticized a bit perhaps), and the mood created carried me along without confusing me or going overboard.The young man who plays the part of Peter does a beautiful job, equal to Anna Paquin's performance in The Piano. This is my favorite movie of 2004. Hard to say much more without getting too deep into the story or revealing things that are best viewed without too much information.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beautifully Written and Touching Performances,"'Findig Neverland' is such a beautiful story and is brought to the screen by wonderful actors and a talented crew. Johnny Depp is dazzling in his performance of the famous Sir James Matthew Barrie who brought us 'Peter Pan.' Depp just takes your breath away with his heartwarming personality, Scottish accent and handsome looks. Kate Winslet as the lovely widow, Sylvia Llwellyn Davies, is one of grace and dignity that makes her character such a strong presence, but she is so dainty and sweet as well. The film is one that will touch your heart forever and you will fall in love with this charming and beloved little tale on the origin of one of the most well known plays of the early 20th century.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
An entertaining drama that plays fast and loose with the facts,"This is the story of J.M. Barrie, the man behind Peter Pan, a fictional figure who, true to form, hasn't aged since his inception over a hundred years ago.The cast is well-assembled, with Depp delivering a top-notch performance as always. That's not to disparage the others, including film veterans Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman. Even the child actors, particularly Freddie Highmore, are convincingly authentic.The directorial style is accomplished, with Marc Forster quietly adding to a resume of diverse and challenging films. Here the action flits seamlessly from fantasy to fact, often within the same scene.Let it be known that the script deviates freely from fact. While I normally can't stand screenwriters 'improving' history this film is not an egregious offender since the script is mostly devoid of cliché. One of the most interesting questions that the characters are confronted with is how to maintain innocence in the face of life's trials and tribulations. This is not a meaningless Hollywood fluff piece, it is a film that attempts to provoke thought while it entertains.If you're looking for historical accuracy, look elsewhere. Otherwise, just enjoy this film for what it is.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Emotional Charmer,"My strong liking for ""Finding Neverland"" is very strange, being that I despise every other film on Mark Froster's resume. However, this is a great film and Forster's usually annoying sincerity and sentimentality is the perfect touch for this film. Johnny Depp shows what a great actor he really is when he takes off all the makeup and quirky mannerisms to pull off a phenomenal performance as Mr. J. M. Barrie. His acting, which in this film is restrained on the surface but powerful within, takes away the possible dullness of the film. The story itself moves along at a rather slow pace, but is charming and enjoyable the entire time. It is driven by stand-out performances by the above-mentioned star as well as Dustin Hoffman and the lovely Kate Winslet. If not already nominated for ""Eternal Sunshine,"" Winslet would surely have received an Oscar nod for this film. The other show-stealer in the movie is actually the young Freddie Highmore. Having not yet received all the fame and offers he did after ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" Highmore acts without any of the arrogance or pretentiousness that we have now become accustomed to seeing him with. The story itself, which is mostly true, is saddening, but at the same time breath-taking and deeply emotional. It's a tear-jerker to the highest degree, and is a great film for men and women of all ages. See it for the fascinating story and the stellar performances.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Moving,"Okay, so I may be a little biased here because when I was a kid, Disney's Peter Pan was my favourite thing in the world, but bear with me. Finding Neverland is a truly wonderful film that is touching, uplifting, moving, happy and sad. Johnny Depp plays Barrie exceptionally well, eccentric and excitable but all the while still restrained enough to be convincing of the time period. His attempt on the Scotting accent was admirable, not perfect, at times he sounded a little too like Shrek, but on the whole better than I could have done, and I have Scottish heritage!Kate Winslet also makes a fine turn, but the real gems of this movie are the children. The young boy playing Peter was exceptional, he really convinced me of the trauma he was going through and I found it heart wrenching that this sweet little boy with a wonderful imagination was having to grow up and deal with the pains of the adult world.Finding Neverland revolves around themes that are all present in Peter Pan, the escapism, the power of belief, the importance of friendship and adventure but most of all the theme of not wanting to grow up. Finding Neverland doesn't really add much that hasn;t already been said about Peter Pan, but what it does do is tell the story of its genesis beautifully. It re-inforces the Peter Pan message of enjoying childhood and that within us all we are all children at heart. It shows that even though J M Barrie had the best and honourable intentions, his actions also caused sadness and grief to those he loved. The film shows his dilemma and the pain this caused him, but also how he need and will to delight the world with wonder and magic drove him to do the things he did. J M Barrie may have upset some people and had personal heartache along the way, but his gift to the millions of people who have enjoyed and loved Peter Pan is a testament to the man's vision. I think this film is a fine reflection of Mr Barrie, his inspiration and the legacy that he has left behind.A wonderful and touching film. 8/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of Johhny Depp's Finest Performances,"Finding Neverland is a fine film with excellent acting and a grand performance by Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean) who easily adapts himself to this type of role. The film delivers a great plot and a great script and the film continues to prosper the whole way through thanks to the excellent directing by Marc Forster. Johnny Depp engages the audience throughout the whole film and the character he plays is a kind, warm-hearted man. Kate Winslet also delivers fine acting, showing off her skills that she also used in films such as Titanic. Freddie Highmore (also be working with Depp in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), young at age, also delivers great acting through the film with the rest of the children. The film shows a range of relationships and difficulties in life, with compelling scenes, Johnny Depp persuades the audience that sometimes you need to sacrifice some relationships for others. This film exceeds my expectations and definitely is worth seeing. This is one Johnny Depp's finest performances and also paves way for the acting life of Freddie Highmore. I recommend the movie for the whole family, but be warned, it may make you cry.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Release your Inner Child,"Marc Froster was the right man for the job. In-depth look at James Barrie is moving and accurate, bringing him back to life with a youthful, charming Johnny Depp. The study of the writer makes his person interesting in the process and never looses the conductive string.The movie is filled with emotional tones and scenes, some too over the top, but the most of them clearly focused. For the ones that are sensible on movie watching, load yourself on tissues. The movie reveals a world which was relentless, conspicuous, close minded. The character of Barrie is a delight and one will fall in love with this child in a grown up body.The art direction revives the Victorian era, with great architectural designs and a beautiful matrix of wardrobes and clothing. The story is emotional and passionate top notch.Don't believe in fairy tales, it's fine. But release your inner child and see this movie, this poem. A great movie that accomplished its goals.

Fantasia on the Life of James M. Barrie,"I love this movie. I really do. I've seen it multiple times and will try to see it again before it leaves theaters. But it needs a different title: it should be called ""Finding Neverland: A Fantasia Loosely Based on the Life of James Barrie."" It is not the life of James Barrie, nor the life of those four (five) boys and their mother. Most of the factual errors of the script have already been pointed out in these comments, but I'll reiterate those that to me seem most egregious: Barrie was an interloper in the family, never really accepted, a surrogate father only in his own mind (heart); much of his acceptance by the family was based on his pocketbook; Sylvia did NOT name him as guardian after her death. His relationship with Sylvia and Arthur's family was always uneasythe movie locates the source of this stress solely in Sylvia's mother (the Julie Christie character), but unfairly. There is no evidence that Mary was a frigid social-climber. Barrie was emotionally damaged himself but (probably) harmless. He was small and peculiar-looking. Of the five Llewelyn-Davies boys, one died at 19 in a suspicious drowning accident at Oxford (suspicious because it might have been a suicide--I believe this was Michael, Barrie's favorite); one was killed in World War I; Peter committed suicide in 1960.Johnny Depp as James Barrie is Barrie as we might have liked to see him, the Barrie we might wish for in our own dreams, no more real than Peter Pan. This movie also gives those boys the childhood we might like to see--and the promise for them of long, non-tragic, and creative lives.But it is a pleasure to see the fantasy, and as a fantasy, it is a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pleasantly surprised,"I just came back from seeing this movie in high spirits. It was one of those rare movies which manages to be both funny and touching at the same time (""Man on the Moon"" comes to mind as another example). The movie is quite straightforward and does not break new ground in any way. But the story is good and uplifting (I wonder how much is actually true), the direction is good if not brilliant, and the acting is overall outstanding. I have had some reservations about Johnny Depp before, but here he is perfect. And the little boy who plays Peter; what can I say, the final scene just blew me away. I laughed out loud and was moved to tears several times during this film. Recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Finding Neverland,"I don't know whether the events of Finding Neverland actually occurred or are fictionalized in this account of playwright J. M. Barrie's life. Forgive me for lazy journalism, but I don't care, and I don't want to know. A good film is a good film is a good film, regardless of whether it actually happened or not. And I can't help but think that such an lovingly crafted film as Finding Neverland - one with wit, wonder, and a sense of magic - is better left ambiguous.Johnny Depp plays Barrie, the playwright best known for writing Peter Pan, as a true gentleman. He's charming and friendly, all right, but in true Depp style, he's also an odd creature. For better or for worse, Barrie doesn't live in reality: he lives in Neverland, a land of pirates and Indians and fairies. In everyone else's version of reality, he's an unhappily married playwright with a floundering career. In short, he wished he hadn't grown up. To this end, he's befriended a widow (Kate Winslet) and her family of four precocious children (Freddie Highmore, Nick Roud, Joe Prospero, and Luke Spill), who he spends his afternoons with make believing.What strikes me is how well-meaning all of the characters are in Finding Neverland. There are no true villains or antagonists. Barrie is apathetic in his marriage, but he never stops loving her or wishes to divorce. Mrs. Barrie (Radha Mitchell) is upset with her husband's seeming affection for Winslet's character, Sylvia, but she gives him numerous chances to repair their relationship. The theater financier (Dustin Hoffman, in a fun supporting role) seems greedy and grumpy, but ultimately admits the play is genius. Even Sylvia's mother (Julie Christie), who's antagonistic towards Barrie at every turn, is acting out of love. It's pleasant to see a movie so lost in the clouds firmly rooted in reality, for in our own lives, is there anyone truly despicable, who's motives can be written off as ""simply hates the world""?Finding Neverland's beating heart is Depp's relationships with Winslet and her most troubled and volatile son, Peter, played by Freddie Highmore. Depp and Winslet have no apparent romantic feelings for each other. The movie doesn't presume to create a romance story, but it weaves a heartfelt love story all the same. As Peter, Freddie Highmore displays a sense of vulnerability that's absolutely heart-wrenching, and, much to Highmore's confusion, Depp becomes a loving surrogate father. I won't spoil the ending, but it's safe to say that Depp, Highmore, and especially Winslet deliver poignant, heartbreaking performances.The film is perfectly paced by director Marc Forster, and the music makes your heart soar while seeming as light as a feather; look for traces of perhaps Forrest Gump and Millions in the score. One of the additional delights of Finding Neverland are all the connections to Peter Pan. The play has never been better when bits and pieces are lovingly shown here, and Barrie's inspiration for the scenes and characters make for a remarkable game of connect the dots.

Awesome,". Given this support it is obvious that the talents of the lead performers will shine, and they glow they do with such understated performances that make the simple story of the sanctity of the inner child so cogent that there is not a dry eye in the house during the thankfully long credits. Johnny Depp continues to prove that he is one of the finest actors on the screen today: his Barrie has a flawless Scottish accent and a manner of movement and facial expressions that make him a gentle hero. Kate Winslet, never more beautiful, likewise embodies Sylvia with exactly the right amount of perk and pathos, and as her mother, Julie Christie is strikingly beautiful and unfailingly solid in a role less than loving. The boys are artfully recreated, never absurdly over the top, always very close to the bridge that crosses the craggy canyon between childhood and adulthood. Growing up has never been better portrayed - by all of the characters!In a time when too often films that address magic and imagination rely on computer effects to create creatures that are comic book absurd, FINDING NEVERLAND relies on simply showing the stage mechanics of the play, suspending wires and all, even in the climax of the story when Barrie brings his successful play to the living room of the ill Sylvia in order to keep his promise to her to take her to Neverland. No gimmicks here, just solid stagecraft very much in keeping with the inherent magic of Barrie's enduring play. This is a brilliant cinematic accomplishment - a feast for the eyes, the ears, the brain, and the soul. Please don't miss it! Grady Harp, November 2004",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Captures a childhood spirit,"Sweet and gentle drama with a sense of whimsy and a super cast. Depp keeps the weird down and comes across as charmingly lovable, Kate Winslet is strong on the surface but vulnerable underneath. There is a terrific performance from Freddie Highmore as young Peter, Dustin Hoffman is fun as J.M. Barrie's sponsor and of course the great Julie Christie is flinty and wonderful as Kate's mother able to do more with mere gestures than most actresses or actors for that matter can with pages of script. The staging of the play is well done and the night of the premiere gives you a real sense of the magic the audience felt in that more innocent time. A charming film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A wonderful movie,"Here is another Johnny Depp performance that makes a movie worth watching no matter what. After 'Pirates of the Caribbean' and 'Secret Window' (that basically only offers the Depp-performance) he once again disappears in his character; this time it is ""Peter Pan""-creator James M. Barrie. Fortunately the movie offers a lot more. The story of Barrie is changed a little. Here the playwright, who just had a terrible release and therefore needs another play, meets the family of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet). She is a widow, left with four children named Peter (Freddie Highmore), George (Nick Roud), Jack (Joe Prospero) and Michael (Luke Spill). Barrie is able to let his imagination go free, creating his own world together with the children. Especially the little Peter, perfectly played by Highmore, is more an adult than he is. His time with this family results in his famous ""Peter Pan"".Barrie, who is married, of course raises questions. What does a married man do with a widow and what does he want from the children? The way Barrie is shown we assume he really wants to be a child himself, loving the children not in a sexual way, but more as his brothers. In fact, he loves Sylvia but even for her we never get the idea that he loves in the sexual way. The villains, if you can call them that, is Sylvia's mother Emma de Maurier (Julie Christie) and a little cough Sylvia is having. A funny thing in the film is the man who needs Barrie to write a new play, Charles Frohman. He is played by Dustin Hoffman who was Hook in Steven Spielberg's adaptation of the play.The changes made in the story seem to be right for the movie. It is very funny from time to time, and actually moving when it wants to be. Besides the fine performances the movie looks very good too. Art direction, costumes and cinematography all add to the quality of the movie and Jan A.P. Kaczmarek's score fits the events perfectly. It is there, giving a scene strength without us really realizing it. 'Finding Neverland' is one of 2004's best movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Realise an Imagination,"In today's rushed world dominated by adults, little thought is given to a child's gift: the imagination. Johnny Depp wonderfully portrays the writer Sir James Matthew Barrie, more commonly known amongst children as the creator of Peter Pan and Neverland. The film shows that the imagination in this man definitely didn't die and produced probably the most successful children's adventure ever.Depp is the standout through both his comical but touching performance. But personally, the acting roles of the minor characters shaped the film into a genuine movie. Kate Winslet induced a fabulous character to Sylvia Davies and especially the young actors of the children that meant the world to Barrie. In particular, Freddie Highmore (Peter Davies) I believe has a huge future on the screen. His emotional presence definitely held the audience (my family) to the credits.In summary, ""Finding Neverland"" pictures a playwright attempting to hit the news through children comedic theatre with huge success. Similar to Depp's original acting choices, the film's title ""Finding Neverland"" didn't ask me to rent it. But surprisingly the movie brought me close to tears (a rare occasion) and should be rightly commended.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fairytale in true form!,"As we reached 21st century movies have become more ""post-modernistic"" in a way they have become movies with huge budget, spectacles (Alexander, Troy), cyber punk movies (Matrix) or those little ""intimate"" ones that have some soul but still their plot doesn't go in classical way (Memento, 21 grams...).In such environment I wanted something new, something classical, pure ""disney-like"" fairytale.With ""Finding Neverland"" I got exactly what I have been waiting for long time.Since it very start you will see how this movie truly has soul, how its very human movie about a man (Johnny Depp) looking for inspiration, finds family with a loving mother (Kate Winslet) and her four children.One of her four children is Peter, boy that after his fathers death lost faith in world and that is so afraid to dream, afraid of believing in something that is lie.His performance is amazing, along with other actors like Depp, Winslet, Dustin Hoffman and Julie Christie.As the story goes, in the end, Barrie will have his play and boy will have his faith back.True happy end, but not cliché happy end but one full of true emotions.As conclusion, I would like to say that this movie is truly for everyone.Adults or children, we all sometimes need something to bring us faith back and this is the right thing for it!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very charming story and a fine insight into the creation of one of the most charming stories!!!,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsSet in 1903 England,this charts the tale of writer JM Barrie (Johnny Depp) who is suffering a set-back in the shape of some plays opening to some particularly lousy reviews.Then he forms a relationship with the recently widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her boys.This film charts how Barrie's relationship with the woman and her boys came to cause some consternation and concern among the people of that era,the deterioration of his own marriage and how their relationship blossomed to such a degree it inspired him to write arguably the most endearing children's tale of our time,Peter Pan.This can best be described as another fine Oscar contender.It is by turns endearing and amusing,with fine performances all round.Depp puts in another fine turn and displays some fine versatility as an actor,not to mention delivering a fine Edinburgh accent.The supporting cast,in the shape of Winslet,Dustin Hoffman,the boys and the rest,roll proceedings along splendidly too.The film truly feels alive with the sense of wonder and imagination that inhabited Barrie's heart and mind.The script also delivers on this front,capturing the heart-and-soul of the film as well as the actual story-telling.If the film has any faults,it's that it's too short.All these positive qualities I've mentioned aren't given perhaps as much room to breathe as to really make them take off and fly.But on the whole,it's a thoroughly worthwhile adventure that deserved to win whatever Oscars it did.****",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

An uplifting beauty.,"Some may call this epic tale of finding happiness in the most unexpected places to be too 'cheesy' or overly sentimental, but I'm inclined to disagree. In this day and age of modern cinema where every week there are three new films released that are gritty, hard-hitting and feature devastatingly pessimistic finales it's a wonder to find a film like Finding Neverland. Something so euphoric, uplifting and purely joyous. Especially when I've been hitting such a brutal case of depression, a film as optimistic as this was the perfect thing to get my mood in a state of happiness for the first time in as long as I can remember. Forster creates a fantastic fairy tale dream of one man's loneliness being cured by a wonderful family, who are full of their own flaws.The story centers around playwright J.M. Barrie, played by Johnny Depp in the most perfect decision of his career, who is suffering a terrible case of mediocrity in his writing abilities. This lack of ability seems to stem from troubles at home where his wife Mary (the increasingly diverse Radha Mitchell) barely notices his existence and is far more focused on their social status than their marital one. In a wonderful meeting of chance, Barrie encounters the Llewelyn Davies family at the park one afternoon. This chance meeting turns into the luckiest experience of Mr. Barrie's life and also happens to be quite the blissful experience for the Davies' as well. We are then taken on a journey of watching J.M. burst out of his writer's block with the help of this beautifully imaginative family, and see that they needed his help just as much as he needed their's.After a devastating loss of the families male lead, Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (played masterfully by Kate Winslet) is left with four boys all to herself. Her slowly decreasing medical condition only makes matters worse and the film is filled with a constant state of approaching dread. Of course, since the film is perfectly magical, even as she passes on it's the beautiful imaginative hearts of Barrie and her four boys that help Sylvia leave this world in a complete state of happiness. With this wonderful relationship established between this family and this married man, we do get glimpses of the obvious tolls it takes on everyone's life. Barrie's marriage falls apart, he receives criticism from the community at large for the nature of his relationship with Sylvia and even the boys and Sylvia's mother constantly tries to bring the spirit of the family down. But it's the magic of these characters and this story that carry the picture on and keep joyous spirit alive.Another interesting subplot to the film is the relationship between James and one of the Davies boys in particular, this boy being Peter (the inspiration for Barrie's title character Peter Pan, played by relative newcomer Freddie Highmore). Peter seems to be the one who struggles the most over the loss of his father and the addition of J.M. into the family life is one of painful sorrow and needed relief for him. He struggles with his feelings of James seemingly replacing his father and the lack of respect he gets from adults. This climaxes in a gut-wrenching scene as Peter destroys the faux-stage that the brother's set up in what is a brilliant display of acting from the young Highmore. Ultimately, Barrie takes Peter under his wing and teaches him the magic of imagination and appropriately helps him to find the infamous Neverland which represents the blissful place in your imagination where no harm can come to you.I mentioned it before, but I would like to go back to Depp's fantastic and deservedly Oscar-nominated performance. The genius of Johnny Depp is clearly displayed in his decision to take this subtle and beautiful role after the eccentricity and wild charisma of playing Captain Jack Sparrow. His performance is very reserved, but this in no way makes it any lesser than his other work. In fact, I believe it to be one of the best portrayal's of his entire career and his best work of this decade so far. All of the performances in this sensational film are excellent (Winslet is another one to be remembered) but this truly is Johnny's show. A dynamic feat in what is now surprisingly one of my favorite films.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Okay, I cried during Henry V (the Kenneth Branagh version) when the French army slaughtered all the pages in the English camp. I don't even tend to care for movies that might make me cry. I spend my hard earned big screen cash on movies with big effects or epic vistas ( think The Matrix or The Lord Of the Ring) Finding Neverland was a glorious exception.Beautifully acted, sweet but not syrupy and perfect for a break from all the holiday madness, Finding Neverland was a true gem. I don't believe its for as young of a crowd as I watched it with ( the 4 year old beside me was constantly needing plot clarification from her mother) but both my 47 year old husband & my 32 year old self were enchanted! In this jaded day & age it was a relief to see a movie that had romance without overt sexuality, a PLOT , and true emotion without sentimentality. And where did they find these child actors? Luke Spill, Joe Prospero, Nick Roud and especially Freddie Highmore were excellent. Rarely have I seen children perform on screen so realistically and charmingly. I'm sure they'll all have brilliant futures if they chose to stay in the business.I would say something here about Johnny Depp but what is there to say? Besides, I'm biased- I've never seen a Johnny Depp movie I didn't like, & I'm sure I've seen ALMOST every one! Julie Christie was a powerhouse playing a difficult character in the most likable way.Don't let this movie slip under your radar!

Now I understand Peter Pan,"This semi-fictional movie about the writer of Peter Pan, James Matthew Barrie, truly surprised me. I knew nothing about it going in, something that I'm usually glad of, and thought I was in for another rendition of ""Hook"" with Johnny Depp instead of Robin Williams. I was confused as to who the characters were and why I should care about them for the first half hour, but as the relationships began to take form I was completely sucked in. Although none of the ideas were amazingly profound (growing up too fast, belief transforming reality, the importance of imagination), the presentation of them was magical. Even though throughout the whole movie they prepare you for what happens at the end, I found myself crying, something I almost never do at movies. I kept waiting for the fairly basic plot to become sappy and overdone, but it never really does, even with all the child actors. Johnny Depp is wonderful as usual and I find that I'm liking Kate Winslet more in every movie I see her in. I thought this movie was made more for children, but I think most of the subtlety of emotion in this movie will be lost on children, while adults may find themselves understanding their childhood a little better.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great performance by Freddie Highmore,"Finding Neverland is about the life of J.M. Barrie, true. But at its emotional heart, what this film is really about is how a child deals with a great loss, the loss of a parent. Freddie Highmore plays Peter, the son of Kate Winslet's character, Sylvia, whose husband has died. All the other children seem to be handling the loss okay but Peter is sensitive and feels the loss more than his siblings. He is the emotional core of this movie. He inspires J.M.

- a terrific movie -,"This movie was one of the best movies I've seen yet. It's a very emotional movie - one of Kate Winslet's greatest. Also, Johnny Depp has shown another side of him that hasn't been shown much in other movies (Johnny Depp, well known for Pirates of the Caribbean). Here he is portrayed as a very serious, high-classed man, as well as a friendly, warm sort of person - very open towards kids. As the movie progresses he goes through many obstacles and challenges he must overcome - emotionally and socially. I've enjoyed it tremendously; is a great movie for any movie emo and a fan of these wonderful actors and actresses. A brilliant movie about a man bringing out the childish imaginations and wonder in himself and others.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wow.,"In 1998 there was some serious controversy over the Best Picture Oscar, which was a toss-up between Saving Private Ryan and Shakespeare in Love. My position was that while Saving Private Ryan is inarguably one of the greatest war films ever made, Shakespeare in Love was a historical epic that managed to tell an in-depth story about Shakespeare's life that is not necessarily historically accurate, but accurate as far as what very little is known about Shakespeare himself. It was a story that was built upon theories of what may have happened in his life to lead him to write the plays that he wrote, and the movie took us back to that time in his life and told an incredible story which makes perfect sense as far as the content of his plays. It was almost like time travel the connections were so sharp. Finding Neverland takes something of the same tactic, tying in people from J.M. Barrie's life to the characters that he created in his plays.Granted, this took place in the early 20th Century and not the early 17th Century, as in Shakespeare's case, and much more is know about Barrie's life than Shakespeare's, but the film tells such a moving and beautiful story that it reinvents the Peter Pan legend, which has by now become such an enduring classic that it almost seems like the vast majority of people alive today grew up on it. It brightened the childhoods of innumerable people, and this brilliant film breathes new life into the story.I've heard numerous criticisms of the film that I don't care to acknowledge or dignify, and surely there are countless reviewers and critics who think they're clever by pointing out the connection between the title of the movie and Michael Jackson's recent lawsuits. I've seen and heard many such comments, and I am always struck by what an efficient method it is for a person to cheapen a great movie and, at the same time, to clearly illustrate their own intellectual shallowness and utter lack of anything important or interesting to say.Johnny Depp fits flawlessly into the role of Barrie, a man who struggled to make a career as a playwright writing plays that he thought the lawyers and doctors in his audience wanted to see, before finally just writing what he believed in with the people in mind that he wanted to entertain  children. He was indeed a pioneer of children's literature, which is why it comes as a surprise to me that people are so quick to jump to conclusions about his interest in children and their entertainment. He was a child at heart, and the children saw him as one of their own. One of the first things that I learned when I studied Children's Literature at the University level was that it is adults, NOT children, that impose sexual meaning onto children's stories. Countless examples can be found in Alice in Wonderland, for example, and have also tarnished the reputation of Walt Disney himself.Classics of children's literature invariably come from people who spend the majority of their time concerned with entertaining children, and I'm thrilled to see that there are still major filmmakers and actors who can see that and look beyond things like the Michael Jackson scandals, which themselves may or may not be true. Personally, I think it is at least as likely that Michael Jackson is either completely insane and literally thinks he's a child himself or that he harbors the same interest in children that Barrie did, which was a completely harmless connection with his inner child, something that the vast majority of adults in the world could use more of.I heard of a study that concluded that children smile something like 200 times a day, while adults smile something like six times a day. That's exactly the kind of thing about which a movie like Finding Neverland is designed to remind us all. When we meet Barrie he is pacing backstage at the opening night of one of his plays, which turns out to be a tremendous flop. He's sitting in the park not long after, mulling over his failed effort, and meets the boys about which his classic play Peter Pan ultimately becomes based upon.The adventures that Barrie and these boys, as well as their mother, have, become the fascinating tour through the life of one of the most creative and fascinating minds in literary history. Finding Neverland is a biography, of sorts, and while the term Inspired by True Events may be the one that describes a story that is based very loosely on a true story, any creative liberties taken with Barrie's life serve only to make his story into more of a captivating fairy tale than it might otherwise have been. The conclusion of the film, for example, where Neverland appears in the boys' house to the wondrous delight of their sick mother is unlikely, but rarely are creative liberties taken with greater success. The only dry eyes in the house, as they say, will indeed be found in the heads of the audience members who display the same bitter frigidness as the grandmother in this movie.And here is the most interesting thing about the way the movie is structured and designed  If you find yourself completely unmoved by it, then it is you that the movie is designed to inspire.Bravo.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is truly a classic,"A 10/10 certainly does not do this film justice. This is one of those films where I knew it would be one of my favorites just halfway through the movie. I am so glad I watched this movie, it is so captivating and sweet that I reprimand myself for not having watched it when it first came out.I think that Mr. Depp does an incredible job at portraying JM Barrie. The subtleties that he carries out in order to depict Barrie is just amazing. I thought that his accent was right on cue as well. The boys were all marvelous. Kate Winslet, great performance, but one role that I thought was vital for this play was definitely the grandmother, as she did a very good job portraying that ""villain"" that tries to ruin the moment.My favorite scene in this movie comes when Michael Davies is in the dungeon talking to Barrie for the first time. That was truly a very innocent scene. I also thought that Marc Forster, one of my favorite directors, did an impressive job in bringing out Barrie's imagination, especially that pirate ship scene, that was priceless.This is an absolute masterpiece that you should go and see.

Johnny Depp's Portrayal as J.M. Barrie Has Taught Me Something I Shall Never Forget,"Peter Pan has always been a classic tale to me; as a matter of fact,a classic Disney tale is more of what i think of it. But what I didn't realize was that there had been another classic tale behind the Peter Pan tale; the tale of the man who imagined it all, Sir J.M. Barrie. Watching the imagination of J.M. Barrie on 1950's technicolor had warmed my heart with joy and eternal happiness. But to understand everything magical their is to know about the tale, you must experience the imagination of J.M. Barrie's mind. Johnny Depp, being one of my favorite actors, portrays one of his greatest roles of his career. Johnny Depp almost becomes J.M. Barrie himself in the film for all I know. What I can tell you is that J.M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) was a playwright who meets a beautiful widow (Kate Winslet) and her four boys. This family inspires J.M. Barrie to write his most well known play of his life, Peter Pan. Depp's performance has never let me down through the film. Another performance that I shall always remember would be the performance of child actor Freddie Highmore, who portrays one of the four boys and who happens to be the closest to J.M. Barrie while trying to learn how to see imagination through the eyes of J.M. Barrie. The London setting was shown beautifully, the costumes were made beautifully and what was the most beautiful of all from this movie was to see the reaction of both audiences on different sides of the screen; the audience of the film and the audience watching the film, including myself. A true classic and more than worthy enough of an Academy Award nomination or winner. I give this film a 10/10 because of the moral it tells me; there is a unique Neverland within all of our imaginations and they must be shared with the world. Johnny Depp's portrayal of the great playwright taught me that and as long as I shall live, I cannot ever forget that.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Awesome film - not to be missed!,"I went to see Finding Neverland last week on the opening day for my 14th birthday. Me and my mom are huge JD fans and we were definitely not disappointed. We also dragged my dad along who is extremely critical, and he said that it was a fantastic film. The acting was brilliant from start to finish. I found myself just accepting that Depp WAS Barrie instead of questioning his portrayal or accent. Kate Winslet was good, but not great. The child actors were convincing and carried the roles well. Freddie Highmore was even cast in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, due to Johnny Depp's persuasion. I took tissues into the cinema with me and I definitely needed them. I was choking back tears halfway through the film and they were pouring out by the end. This film lives up to everything said about it and much much more. A must see film!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Finding Neverland Inspires,"I usually wait until films of this type (non-epic, non-adventure) come out on video/DVD. I was fortunate to see an advance screening and am very, very glad I saw it on the big screen. It's well worth the price of admission.Finding Neverland is a completely enjoyable and uplifting fictionalization of J.M. Barrie's creative process for his most famous work, Peter Pan. It combines a sensitive exploration of the benefits of fantasy to children and adults, and also examines the need to respect children's intelligence in the face of difficult matters such as illness and death. The production, from costumes to locations to casting and the truly imaginative fantasy sequences, is impeccable. Leading the extraordinary cast are Johnny Depp completely convincing as the writer Barrie.Mr. Depp continues to amaze with an understated, intelligent and emotionally searing performance, which is echoed by the young Freddie Highmore, who gives as good as he gets from his better-known co-stars. Far from being a chick flick or sedate historical drama, this film has a lot to say about the way boys grow into men, and how childhood indelibly affects us all.The two young girls (aged 6 and 9) who sat in front of me thoroughly enjoyed it; here's a family film for the holidays that is about believing in something more than Santa, elves and the North Pole. Probably not for the youngest kids, but age 6 and up should do fine.One word recommendation: GO!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Captures the spirit of innocence,"In a culture that worships youth, the most logical step of course is not to grow up, something a few people I know are working on. Their role model is Peter Pan or the Boy Who Would Not Grow Up, a play by J.M. Barrie, first performed in 1904. Though it is speculated that Barrie wrote Peter Pan to immortalize his dead brother David as the perfect child, conventional wisdom suggests that the story emerged from tales told to the five sons of Arthur and Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, boys to whom Barrie grew close and eventually became guardian. Though Barrie was a questionable figure with many hints about his dark side, in Marc Forster's Finding Neverland, his life is dramatized as wholesome family entertainment without a trace of ambivalence, sexual or otherwise.According to Anthony Lane, ""He (Barrie) was short and slight, with bags under his eyes and a pale, protuberant brow, like a clever schoolboy who has stayed up late reading books under the bedclothes. He had a heavy mustache and a pipe smoker's percussive cough"". Johnny Depp plays Barrie in a convincingly understated manner though in fact he looks nothing like him. As the film opens, Barrie is undergoing an artistic crisis. His latest play is a failure and he is without inspiration, prodded to do better by Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman), his money conscious producer. His marriage faltering for reasons only hinted at, his prospects dubious, Barrie encounters a family of four bright youngsters, ages 5 to 12, and their widowed mother (Kate Winslet) relaxing in the neighborhood park and Barrie is ""drawn"" to the boys.Together they put on improvised plays, fly homemade kites in the park, play cowboys and Indians in the backyard, and dress up as pirates, activities which laid the groundwork for what became Peter Pan. The meetings become regular and the boys start to refer to him as Uncle Jim. He offers them use of the summer cottage that he and Mary never use, and they are very grateful. All are spared the distasteful experience of having to grow up. Their relationship raises eyebrows in Victorian London, however, and Sylvia's stern mother (Julie Christie) accuses Barrie of harming her daughter's chances of getting her life together and remarrying. Barrie begins to write again and develops a play about a young boy who takes his friends to a place called Neverland where no one ever grows up and the rest is history (or speculative fiction as the case may be).Johnny Depp delivers Barrie as sweet and loving, without a devious bone in his body and Winslet is strong in the role of the widowed mother who is gradually developing a serious lung disease. The highlight of the film, however, may be the performance of young Freddie Highmore as the real Peter, the boy who has grown up too fast. Though Finding Neverland is a sanitized version of real events, it engagingly captures the spirit of innocence in danger of disappearing from our modern life and it can be enjoyed on its own merits. If the influence of the Davies family brought out the best in Barrie, perhaps it can do the same for us, stimulating a generation grown cynical into recapturing the spirit of their inner child.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fable,"Fable""Children should never be made to go to bedthey wake up a day older"". This statement by James Matthew Barrie, creator of 'Peter Pan, Or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up', in director Marc Forster's moving and reassuring fable, 'Finding Neverland', captures the quintessence of the film. Based on the original play, 'The Man Who Was Peter Pan' by Allan Knee, this cinematic adaptation has at its core a very simple but true message- if only we believe, we can preserve our innocence(and in the world we live, that is the single most difficult thing to preserve).J.M. Barrie(Johnny Depp), coming out from a theatrical disaster(his recent play has been lambasted by the critics), meets the Davies boys in a summer that would lead to his creation of Peter Pan. Barrie, himself never having lived his own childhood(his brother died when Barrie was a child, and his mother called him by his brother's name to fill her void), finds in the boys a purity that enthralls him to an extent where it begins to feed the artist and the locked up child within him. Barrie starts to frequent the Davies household causing much uproar, albeit hushed, in the Victorian circles. Both, his relationship with Sylvia Davies(Kate Winslet)- the widowed mother of the children, and his intent behind spending afternoons with young kids are questioned. But to Barrie, this is an opportunity to imagine as he has never done before and perhaps also, a chance to repair. A chance to repair the childhood that he had lost by infusing it in Peter Davies(Freddie Highmore), a boy who seems to have grown up too soon. Barrie creates a world of wonder around the boys by weaving imagination and we can see his next play taking shape. And in Barrie's imagination(as he must've preferred in reality), Peter transforms into Peter Pan- the boy who wouldn't grow up!Johnny Depp is a rare actor who doesn't allow his good looks to limit his acting range. His performance as Barrie is near perfect. Watch how his closeness to Sylvya never translates into attraction. Similarly, notice his coldness when in the company of his wife, Mary(Radha Mitchell), and the merry glint in his eyes when with the children. Depp's performance is worthy of his Oscar nomination. Kate Winslet excels as the ailing widow, but we have come to expect good performances from her. Radha Mitchell is a revelation in her small part and Dustin Hoffman adds his own style of dry wit in a small role as Charles Frohman- Barrie's impresario. But the standout performance is by Freddie Highmore as Peter- the boy who inspired Peter Pan. Freddie performs remarkably and tugs at your heart every time he speaks. The emotional array that this kid covers is unbelievable, and his is-without a doubt- one of the best child performances in years.David Magee, the man behind the screen adaptation, keeps his screenplay fluid and uncomplicated. He knows that this is not a biopic. Thus, taking liberties, he uses the prospect to tell a magical tale where all you need is imagination. As Frohman points out in the movie, ""The critics have made it importantbut what is it? What?...It is a play!"" Sometimes all we need is a little imagination. No waitthat is all we need! And the boy shall never grow!Abhishek BandekarNote- 'Finding Neverland' is nominated in seven categories at this year's Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor(Johnny Depp) and Best Adapted Screenplay(David Magee).Rating- ***** Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent30th January, 2005",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Peter Pan,"The boundless imagination of James Mattew Barrie the man behind 'Peter Pan', the classic literature that speaks to the child in all of us. Finding Neverland traverses both fantasy and everyday reality, melding the difficulties and heartbreak of adult life with the spellbinding allure and childlike innocence of the boy who never grows up. An emotional tale. It all begins with the successful Scottish playwright J.M Barrie watching the opening of his latest play to the ho-hum reaction among the polite society of Edwardian England. A literary genius of his times but bored of the same old themes, Barrie is clearly in need of some serious inspiration. Unexpectedly he finds it one day on his daily walk with his dog in a London park. Barrie encounters four fatherless boys and their beautiful recently widowed mother. Despite the disapproval of the boy's grandmother and the resentment of his own wife, Barrie becomes a good friend to the family, engaging the boys in tricks, disguises, games and sheer mischief, creating play-worlds of castles and kings, cowboys and Indians, pirates and castaways. He transforms hillsides into galleon ships, sticks into mighty swords, kites into enchanted fairies and the four kids into the lost boys of Neverland.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Touching the soul of inspiration,"How do you capture that suspension of disbelief that not only makes a great movie or a great play, but is at the heart of every playful notion that has captivated a child at play, every romantic phrase that has enchanted a woman towards her dreams, every word of love that a woman has blanked everything from the mind of the man she adores, every uplifting speech of every great leader that has given hope and fortitude to the populace . . . where is the seat of that creative vision, that sees beyond the world as it is, reaches out towards the world as it could be, and communicates the joy of that vision?Finding Neverland traces key events of a great writer, JM Barrie, whose childless and less than perfectly happy life not only found joy and fulfilment in creating such a dream, but whose story, Peter Pan, while on the surface a children's story, also examined the very ways that we exercise creativity or 'make-believe'.Johnny Depp produces another of his perfectly-believable-and-utterly-memorable characters in the form of the troubled author and playwright. Kate Winslet, as the Sylvia whose children provide the inspiration for Peter Pan, does not yet seem to have the acting range to provide exquisitely formed new personas with every film, but her charisma nevertheless screams out from every scene (and, in accordance with every non-skeletal woman's fantasy, she looks totally ravishing). Julie Christie (who plays her mother) and Dustin Hoffman (who plays the producer of Barrie's play) are barely recognisable, giving great dignity to their supporting roles by not hogging the limelight. Kelly Macdonald, the token Scots person, provides a wonderful stage Peter Pan, covering her Scots accent almost as well as Depp contrives his (JM Barrie was from Kirriemuir in Forfar, Scotland).Perhaps the most ironic thing about Finding Neverland is that it is a film not for children (or even teenagers) but for adults. The deep (and largely unspoken) emotion between Depp and Winslet, the process of reaching out and communicating through poetic language, the way children *do* grow up (and the way adults remain children), and where fantasy and reality begin and end - these are themes more easily recognised by those who have (or maybe always wanted to have) brought up children, rather than those children themselves. Unrequited love, the things that move an audience (and when, why and how it will move them to bring critical acclaim and their cheque books), the importance of artistic and personal legacies -all these topics are treated in a responsible way that Barrie, if he indeed fully understood the importance of what he wrote, would have been proud.Finding Neverland cradles a lasting inspiration - perhaps one that will last into eternity.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Quite magical, acting wise.","Finding Neverland is a bit of a sleeper movie. A movie that you have to discover on your own, I mean, I wasn't in a huge rush to see this in the theater, nor when it came out on DVD, but I did get a chance to view it via the library (yay libraries!) and I was quite charmed and of course emotional by the biography of James Barrie, more specifically, about how he got to write Peter Pan.I never knew that the story for Peter Pan was so personal to Barrie, and the movie here is a wonderful illustration of how Barrie used elements, mainly with his interaction with a widow's children, to put the play together. The movie uses fantasy and the real world flawlessly to build an excellent narrative.And what of Johnny Depp? His acting here is flawless, and had every right to be nominated for an Academy Award (He should've won! Boo Jamie Foxx!). It also helps that he's accompanied by some amazing actors, Kate Winslet of course, but I really liked the woman playing Barrie's wife, Radha Mitchell, who I've never seen before, she was quite good, and of course, the always amazing Julie Christie.

It is also the first movie I've seen that accurately shows what it is like being a writer (as I am one myself) with glorious flights of fancy that are both wonderful to witness and (at last!) do not detract from the film as a whole.Johnny Depp puts in one of the finest performances in his career as the author of Peter Pan, J.M. Barrie. After his latest play flops in London's West End, Barrie begins a friendship with the four children of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and finds his inspiration for his next play, a story about a boy who never grows up - ""Peter Pan"". But the relationship between the Davies' and Barrie puts a tremendous strain on his wife (Radha Mitchell) as well as Sylvia's mother (Julie Christie).It is truly staggering how different Depp is here from his role in ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" - here, he is controlled and graceful and his Scottish accent is impeccable. But Depp faces strong competition from the four child actors (Freddie Highmore, Joe Prospero, Nick Roud & Luke Spill) who are also fantastic as the Davies' children. The film also looks superb, with a relentless turn-of-the-century feel for the most part and a surreal dream-like quality during Barrie's flights of fancy when his and the boys' imagination takes over. And while a film based on how a play is written doesn't sound that gripping, it never fails to captivate and hold your attention. My one gripe is that it's a bit too similar to ""Shakespeare In Love"" but given how extraordinary that film was, that is hardly criticism - indeed, it is mighty praise for a film that surprised and entertained me for every minutes of its duration.I'd happily recommend this film to almost anybody. It's imaginative, emotive and gloriously realised - such a shame that it didn't win more Oscars because this is one of the best films to be released this side of the millennium. It's one of the finest pieces of escapism I've seen and I defy anyone not to feel choked at the end. It's a great date movie as well as fabulous family entertainment, although young children may find their attention wandering. Most of all, it's an intelligent and beautifully produced ""writers"" movie which, if we're honest, don't come along very often. If you haven't seen it then believe the hype - this is one movie you simply have to see, even if you're not a fan of period dramas (like myself). Depp does it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A touching look at  creative Inspiration and dealing with loss,"First of all it's NOT A BIOGRAPHY, and doesn't pretend to be! It is about finding inspiration for creativity and how it can help deal with loss. I found it to be perfectly cast, and a beautifully crafted movie. Each actor makes his or her role believable.Depp's accent was convincing, as was his character. He was able to convey perfectly what those who knew Barrie said, that he was asexual and enjoyed the company of children because he never truly grew up. I thought the relationship with his wife was very well done. So much was said without words. Barrie couldn't give her what she needed, and visa versa. They cared about each other but could not connect or sustain their relationship. All the children were superb, especially Freddie. I loved the scenes between Hoffman and Depp also, so droll. I'd like to see them work together again.I'll be seeing it again as I was so involved in the dialogue and expressions that I really didn't have time to absorb all the detail that went into this movie. It's definitely worth a visit to Finding Neverland. HOWEVER, if you have the attention span of a gnat, hate period drama or want lots of action you'll likely miss the entire point of this movie. It's also not for young children.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A magical experience!,"Johnny Depp once again shows his extraordinary talent as the playwright who created Peter Pan. This may be his best role yet! He is accompanied by a fine supporting cast, including four talented young boys who play the Davies brothers. The characters all have depth and believability, and Depp's Scottish accent is superb. Gorgeous costumes and sets provide a sumptuous backdrop for the action, and the cinematography is creative, with a deft use of camera angles and special effects. Some of the scenes are so beautiful and finely crafted that they will remain in my memory forever. Go see this movie and be carried away on the wings of imagination to a place where everything is possible.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
fabulous,"This movie was brilliant! Johnny Depp is surely in ""a league of his own"" by now (as I heard someone at the theater comment while exiting). Anyone who thinks this movie was terrible or lackluster truly is a prime example of what Mr. Barrie talked about in this film -- no imagination! I've read countless reviews bashing the film just because Johnny Depp is extraordinary, but the others can't hold their own. But that is just far from the truth. Half the theater that I saw it in was so wrapped up in the story that no one was eating their popcorn, slurping their drinks, or even coughing, they were that spellbound. It is not just a children's movie -- three quarters of the people in the theater watching it were adults and this was on a Saturday night! Go see the movie and be prepared to laugh, cry, be amazed and have your breath taken away.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"very sad, but first-rate!","i had been looking forward to this film for some time and i found myself not in the least disappointed upon the viewing of it. the movie was very sad - bittersweet- but it had just enough humor in it to make it quite enjoyable. i felt the film had a genuine realism to it, despite being about the author of the master of escapism - peter pan (of course!). johnny depp did very well in his role, but it was a unique experience for me to see him so subdued. i could almost feel him holding back from his usual eccentricities. he was very normal(!), real, and tender. kate winslet was perfect as the tragic mother of the llewelyn davies boys. she conveyed sadness so well that just to look at her (nearer to the end of the film) made tears and all sorts of pain well up from deep inside me. i also must say that the most striking character was peter llewelyn davies played by (?)freddie highmore. his dialogue and the way he delivered it cut to the quick. he was very sharp and really held his own with the grown-ups. i hope many folks get out to see this sweet, melancholy, triumphant, touching film. i definitely hope it gets a decent run!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A salute to the great Depp,"This is the most emotional and inspirational movie i have ever seen recently.The great Johnny Depp delivered a first class performance in every aspect, i liked his accent, you would not believe he is an American if you do not know him.Kate Winslet is magnetic as usual, Julie Christie and Radha Mitchell were in there best shapes to do such a beautiful job.The score, oh.. my god, not even John Williams or Hans Zimmer could have composed a better music, it is just fitting perfectly with every scene, truly Oscar winner.one more last thing,the talented born Freddie Highmore, he left me in heavy tears at the end of the movie, i wish i knew where did he get all that natural talent, a bright future is ahead of that kid.This is a MUST see movie for all ages, for all times.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Outstanding,"If there was a better chance for Johnny Depp to get his hand on the holy grail (Oscar) then this has got to be it, his performance was outstanding, the directing superb and Kate Winslet was sublime, this has got to be a contender for best picture.If there are films you have to see this year, this has got to be in the top three, this is such a good performance by Johnny Depp portraying J M barrie, it is a pity that there has not been such a film for his greatest creation Peter Pan, great film, great cast, I would highly recommend it, what are you reading this for, go to your local cinema and watch the top contender for film of 2004!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"If you want to dream again, see this movie.","This is an excellent movie about trust, believe and about dreams. Johnny got the essence of his role. He is an excellent actor that really believes in his acting. Johnny born to be an actor. In this movie Johnny shows that he has a free spirit as Peter's Pan. The rest of the cast was wonderful too, Kate did an excellent job, she really convince us that she was the mother who really cares about the childhood and the importance of develop your own trust.

What a great night out!!,"We love getting out to see a great movie and while my expectations of Johnny Depp exponentially increase with each movie he does, this was an exceptional performance that far exceeded any of my expectations. What a wonderful bit of fun and fantasy. I came away absolutely elated and feeling like all was possible. This movie will become part of our families' video library and I dare say will become a classic in many families libraries. Out standing performances by a very talented cast, a great story, a real treat for those that enjoy fantasy and a little escapism. We thoroughly enjoyed every minute and highly recommend it, well worth the price of admission and the babysitter. Johnny what will you do to top this!! Here's hoping that you get the Oscar for this performance",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Johnny Depp as a Dandy!,"He is most beautiful here. If you are a Johnny Depp lover, as am I, you will enjoy his performance here, completely. Some reviewers have said it glows but it does not flame. For me it flamed but glowing is great too.His character is entirely sympathetic and empathetic. The ending is sad but I would like to read more about this episode. In real life, I think Barrie would have acted sooner on his feelings for her. I fould Kate Winslet to be perfect for the role and the little boys were truly delightful. The scenes from the play were breathtaking and delicious but I though Julie Christie's character was a bust.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Finding Neverland is the movie, we always wanted.","Finding Neverland is perhaps one of my favorite movies of all time. It combines all the movie elements perfectly to create the movie, we all have dreamed of. The wonderful combo includes a beautiful, moving plot, stellar performances, and excellent design.Marc Forrester assembled an amazing creative team with a vision full of heart.Yet the heart wasn't good enough for any of the Award Academies because they would rather hail a colossal box-office hit, then a brilliant form of art. I feel that 'Finding Neverland' lacked the attention it deserved and was very under ratted. Still the movie is magnificent and magical for those who truly believe.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Imagination Creation,"Nominated as one of the best films of 2004, ""Finding Neverland"" sweeps us off our feet with the story of the creation of J.M. Barrie's play ""Peter Pan"". Playwright J.M Barrie's (Johnny Depp) latest play not only fails him, but also leaves him without hope of ever writing a successful play. One afternoon in the park, J.M. Barrie is attempting to create a play when he is introduced to the widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four sons. The six of them form a surrogate family and with the memories they create, Barrie finds the inspiration he needs that will help him produce ""Peter Pan"", his greatest play ever.The hidden message in this film is that there is imagination in everyone; it just needs to be awakened. There is a scene in the movie where Barrie teaches the Davies boys that if they believe in something hard enough, it can come true. Barrie sparks their imagination by pretending his dog is a bear and dances with it. Peter, one of the Davies boys, refuses to imagine anything and insists the dog is not a bear. Peter is trying to grow up too fast, so it is up to Barrie to reignite the boy's imagination spark. While helping Peter, Barrie finds his own imagination has been revived.""Finding Neverland"" is classified into the drama genre because of the intense character building and character relationships. Historically, this movie was quite accurate, including small details such as Barrie's Scottish accent. The actors cast for this film did a phenomenal job of captivating audiences of all ages and types. As far as music and graphics goes, it only enhanced the beauty of this story. It's no wonder that ""Finding Neverland"" was nominated as one of the best films of 2004. A story for young and old a like, the creation of imagination will never grow up.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
FINDING IS CINEMATIC NEVERLAND!,"Without a doubt the best film I've seen all year. Finding Neverland is the most winning emotionally charged, fantasy infused drama you're ever going to see. Beautifully filmed and expertly directed the film sports fine award winning performances by Depp and Winslet with a solid supporting cast. Everything about the film is just plain beautiful and just plain perfect. it's the story of Peter Pan's play author James Barry who after a section of writers block falls in love with a single mother and her four sons. From them he is inspired to write the classic Peter Pan. The film is inspired by true events and inter cuts scenes of emotional realism with scenes of imaginative creativity scene through the charchter's eyes. The brilliant execution only screams out pure magic in a film that won't be matched this year. i haven't cried like this in a film in so long. even during the credits I spouted tears of sorrow as well as tears of joy. Joy for finding a movie of such beauty and creativity. Of such originality emotional power. of such a cinematic Neverland.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"one of the most touching movies of all times, a true master Eve","i saw this movie two days ago and i am still in awe of it. i am sure that it will become one of those rare timeless masterpieces. the movie brought new light to one of those masterpieces peter pan. johnny Depp gave an amazing performance he played the part of j.m. Berrie amazingly never has one movie ever touched me so deeply. it is certainly a tear jerker. I saw the movie with my girlfriend, my best friend, and his girlfriend and at first i was ashamed to let them see me cry but when i could hold back any longer i looked over to see all 3 of them crying as well as everybody else in the theater. that is how touching the movie is it brought two 21 year old men to tears. we have been friends since we were in third grade and neither have ever seen the other cry. this movie is just simply perfect. it shows exactly how time is chasing after each and everyone of us and the only defense we have against it is our imaginations. i wish that everyone would see this movie so they might realize how short life really is and maybe they might just think back to when they were just a boy hunting pirates in the jungle of their backyard",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Movie with an Imagination All Its Own,"Imagination is the fuel of movies. From the most light-hearted of animated features to the grimmest of human tragedies, it is imagination that creates the characters and the stories. But what about the films regarding the subject of imagination? Most of them are filled with cheesy dialogue and songs about love, but Finding Neverland is, shall we say, a horse of a different color.Finding Neverland is the story of playwright J.M. Barrie, and the manner in which his famous play Peter Pan came into being in the early 1900s. The story revolves around Barrie and his ""adventures"" with a widow and her four sons. Barrie is played by Johnny Depp with a subtlety that shows the full range of Depp's acting skill. Whereas a movie about a playwright with great imagination could have been a loud, comedic affair, Depp stays quiet and sincere. Kate Winslet as Mrs. Davies, the widow, is somewhat overshadowed by Depp's performance, but her own performance is good in its own right. Most surprisingly, the four young sons do a decent acting job, rarely ever seeming forced in their dialogue.The film is also directed quite well by Marc Forster as the scenes travel between Barrie's imagination and reality. The blend of these two elements is close to perfection, as fantasy is contrasted sharply with harsh reality. Also, Jan A.P. Kaczmarek's score has gotten some buzz, and the buzz is well-deserved. True, the melodies of the score don't remain in one's mind after the film has ended, but that is merely because the rest of the film is so captivating.As I mentioned before, I'm thankful that Finding Neverland didn't collapse into a stereotypical Disney-esquire film. In fact, during the end credits, no tacky song about imagination is to be heard. However, the film does not totally escape the horrible dialogue found in other films of the sort like, ""your imagination can take you anywhere,"" and various pathetic nonsense of the sort. My only other complaint regards the film's beginning, which catapults Barrie so quickly into an intimate relationship the Davies family, that the viewer barely has time to catch his breath and finds himself in a state of disbelief that such a relationship could develop so quickly.Overall, this one's worth your time due to some great performances, pleasing direction, and avoidance, for the most part, of stereotypical imagination material.Final Grade: B+.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best movies I have ever seen!,"Johnny Depp is excellent in this picture and plays the role of J.M Barrie perfectly. It is quite a funny movie yet touching and quite eccentric. I would say it is the best movie of the year and it will be for many years to come. I do not think any movie will come close to beating this film in excellence. The boy who played Peter was quite exceptional and will steel your heart the first time you see him. This film was perfectly cast. I congratulate the cast and crew of this production. They have done a marvelous job producing such a well written script. They brought out the magic and made it the best film I have seen since Finding Nemo. If you have not seen this movie, you must!

Wow,"There is only one word that i can think of which truly describes this film. That word is wow.Prior to seeing this film, i had herd the reviews on the radio and friends told me what they thought of it. However, when i went to see the film earlier this evening, a friend asked me what i thought, but i was unable to tell her. I just didn't know what to tell her, I was truly speechless. there is no way that such magic could be put into a brief description.There was no melodrama, no falseness, no ""why am i here?"". Throughout the film, the cinema was totally silent... no talking or giggling at all. i had a brief look around the screening room and everyone was staring intently at the screen, lost in the magic that is Finding Neverland.There was not one thing that i could fault from the opening scene to the closing credits. The acting was above anything i had previously seen, the attention to detail was astounding and the direction of the movie was perfect. The actors did not seem forced and the performances seemed to come from the heart...Kate Winslet was Sylvia, dying but wanting to protect her children and not face the truth...Peter was a young boy trying to come to terms with the death of his father and johnny Depp was Barrie.I have seen many films that would have been a total flop if it had not been for the talent of Johnny Depp and when i first heard of this project i sincerley hoped that this would not be the same. i can honestly say that it was not...taking any of the cast away would have taken the magic and sparkle from Finding Never Land.I don't doubt that everyone in the cinema today did indeed find Neverland.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Go Back to Your Childhood or London of 1904...,"Theatergoers arriving at another opening night of a J. M. Barrie play provides an initial opportunity to drift back 100 years to a departed era in Marc Forster's 'Finding Neverland'. Sir James Matthew Barrie (Johnny Depp) anxiously awaitsthe audience's reaction to his latest work. An encounter with the children of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies in Kensington Gardens alters the trail Barriesprofessional career takes. Striking up a friendship with Sylvia (Kate Winslett) and her four boys Michael (Luke Spill), George (Nick Roud), Jack (JoeProspero) and Peter (Freddie Highmore), Barrie's imagination is influenced and transported to a magical place, which can live in the heart of anyone. The acting in this production is authentic. Depp, Winslett, Although Highmore'sperformance is good, the work of the other three brothers is just ascommendable! The Saturday evening I viewed 'Finding Neverland', the entire,mostly-adult audience was at stone-quiet, rapt attention while transported into turn-of-the-last-century London. Granted, there are many true facts about Barrie and the Davies boys that have been altered for this production, but movies are fantasy, too, just like 'Neverland', and the storyline weaves itself well throughout the entire length of the film. Art direction (Peter Russell) was inspired, and settings, costuming (Alexandra Byrne and Mary Kelly) and properties wereconvincing and representative of a bygone era while providing a visualindulgence. The film provided a moving experience for the audience. Upondeparture from the theatre, I overheard a woman state her husband wiped awaya tear from his face, something she had never before seen him do at a movie.Perhaps that is the best tribute to 'Finding Neverland' which exemplifies the loss of the purity of youth, as children become adults much too soon.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Here comes an Oscar for Depp!!,"This movie was absolutely amazing in many ways. I was fortunate enough to see it on a sneak preview even though it does not open until November. It really is about believing in yourself and taking things lighter--these are many identifiable themes. This is a movie you could take your grandmother to--really enchanting and thankfully squeaky clean!! A warning: bring the Kleenex--I cried quite a bit!It is all about J.M. Barrie's life and circumstances leading to his inspirations for writing ""Peter Pan"" and performing it as a stage play. Look for Hoffman in a rather small role, unfortunately, there is little of Captain Hook and it does not involve him--what a shame! However, his performance is still effective. Kate Winslet is, as always, very good as the mother of the boys. She has a touching subplot. Radha Mitchell is also good, although she plays the traditional ""wife role"", which gives her little to do more than pout. Julie Christie gives one of the better performances of the movie. You will fall in love with precious Freddie Highmore--easily stealing many scenes, and he is a formidable match with Johnny Depp. No wonder Depp fought for him to play Charlie in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". Finally, Johnny Depp is absolutely grand and believable as Barrie, mastering an accent, and using minimal makeup. He adds the perfect blend of childlike twinkle while also handling the adult role. If he is not in the Oscar race for Best Actor, I will be absolutely stunned, and I can usually pick them.While this sounds like some mush-melon review, it is not really supposed to be anything more than to praise the movie for what it is. I didn't really even want to see this movie, and I ended up loving it, which is rare for me.Anyway--go see it--you'll be glad you did!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

a little trippy but a great success,"As always, Johnny Depp performs magnificently. Kate Winslet is an adoring mother, but it seems that she always has troubles with her mother. Freddy Highmore is a wonderful Peter, and I cannot believe how talented he is. Depp portrays J.M. Barrie, the writer of Peter Pan. In the beginning, the failure of another of his plays is shown. His wife seems aloof and condescending, while he tries to continue writing and accept his failure. In the park one day, he befriends the sons of Sylvia Llewelyn-Davies, and the friendship with not only the boys but also with Sylvia grows. The adventures he has while playing with the boys inspires him, and he begins writing Peter Pan. The movie focuses on this relationship and how it affects those in J.M.'s life. It constantly refers to ""Neverland"", the land where anything is possible and when children become adults, Neverland is where their childhood goes. The love J.M. has for everyone and everything is brilliantly shown. I believe this is a great film filled with love, struggle, and brilliance, and could not be better in any way.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
