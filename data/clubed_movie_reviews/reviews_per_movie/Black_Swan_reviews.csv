Painful to Watch,"This is one of those films best seen only once. It hones in on the fragility of an artist and lays open wounds that are hard to witness. Natalie Portman's character is driven but vulnerable and s set up to succumb to her art. Of course, rivalry is a given, and her rival does everything she can to put the screws to her. Unfortunately, the questioning of her own talent is going to show at some point. I can't say I enjoyed this movie. I realize that obsession is often a strength with artists, but it can also be all consuming. This film is about as dark as it can be but it puts a stranglehold on the viewers.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Amazing Natalie Portman performance,"Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a New York City ballerina living with her overbearing mother (Barbara Hershey). The prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) is being replaced for the opening production of Swan Lake. Nina is the favorite, but new dancer Lily (Mila Kunis) is impressive as well. Nina fits the role of the beautiful, fearful, fragile White Swan perfectly, but she can't get the Black Swan role right unlike Lily. She's obsessed with her deteriorating body as her paranoid mind collapses.This is a great performance from Natalie Portman. There's a sense of chaos and insanity falling down on her. It definitely has the sensibility of director Darren Aronofsky. Although I do wonder where he's going with this movie at times. It has a realism and a horror feel to the movie. Portman's body slowly turns into a horror show is reminiscent of Jeff Goldblum picking apart his body in 'The Fly'. Mila Kunis is playing a pretty interesting mean girl, or is it all in Nina's head. That's the beauty of this movie. It plays not just with Nina's mind, but the audience's mind.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A beautiful and nightmarish masterpiece,"There are not enough words in the English language to describe the praise Darren Aronofsky deserves for Black Swan. It was one of the most talked about and sought after films at this year's Toronto International Film Festival (which I managed to snag a ticket for), and for good reason – it is a masterpiece that is just as much beautiful as it is nightmarish.Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) has toiled for years within a New York ballet company, always pushing herself. The company has fallen under hard times, and director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) makes the swift decision to put on a new rendition of the classic Swan Lake. With the company's go-to lead pushed into retirement, Nina is quickly selected to be the lead in the new ballet. With competition arriving in the form of new dancer Lily (Mila Kunis), and the demanding desire for perfection from both Thomas and her overbearing mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), Nina begins a journey into dark uncharted territory.Black Swan is an enthralling and visceral experience from beginning to end. Aronofsky has used what he has learned from making the raw and unflinching The Wrestler and the cerebral horror and incredibly disturbing Requiem for a Dream, and has crafted a film that you will simply not be able to take your eyes off of. He builds up rather slow, but right after that first moment of off-the-rails insanity, he delivers one hell of an incredible piece of cinema. One that is not easily able to be classified to any one genre.While you may have read suggestions that Black Swan and The Wrestler are two halves of the same film, make no mistake at looking at it any further beyond the comparison of being about two people toiling within two very different forms of art. Black Swan is never a low budget character piece. It is a film that navigates between being thrilling and horrific at the same time. While the horror elements start to take more prominence in the second half (specifically the rather squeamish elements of body horror, done in a way that would make David Cronenberg proud), the film never lets one completely overtake the other. It manages to maintain this sense of dread, darkness and rather graphic wound/injury infliction throughout.The visuals and editing are the drive of what helps make the film so well done. Contrasting blacks and whites so frequently give the obvious hints of good and evil, innocence and darkness. But Aronofsky likes to throw in hints of ambiguity at every turn, changing the colours for each character depending on the scene, and depending on what they may or may not be doing. Even the scenery and set design is in plain black and whites, always making the audience guess the true motivations and intentions of both character and creator. Adding in the element of reflection, both in others and the self (mostly through mirrors), only helps compound these feelings of ambiguity and confusion. It will consistently keep audiences thinking about what is being shown and what is actually going on. The subtle visual effects and astoundingly well done score only help add to the greatness.Aronofsky also deserves recognition for the film's lean running time. When so many films are often far too long and dragged out, this film maintains a sense of momentum that never gets lost at any point. The film's slow points are never dragged out, merely well padded out for the shift from Nina being innocent to adrenaline soaked horror as she descends into the realm of darkness. Rather gracefully, Aronofsky manages to balance the goal of Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin's script to blend Nina's tale with the story of Swan Lake itself, and never loses sight or direction at any instance. This is bravado style filmmaking at its finest, and more than suggests that the brilliant direction in Requiem for a Dream was not a fluke.Portman, who has shown her acting merits before in the likes of Closer, delivers a startlingly intense and beautiful performance as Nina. At once you can see the innocent, sexually repressed little girl who just wants to please her mother, and the sexually depraved fallen angel, inching closer towards independence and adulthood. She is very clearly not ""well"" in the beginning of the film, and as the film progresses, you can practically chart her 180-degree reversal in character. She is downright terrifying in many instances, and more than proves her worth as an actress. When she finally dons makeup late in the film, her transformation from a once promising talent to a full blown powerhouse talent becomes simply marvelous to watch.The supporting cast only helps to further complement Portman's extraordinary performance. Cassel is amazing as always as the slimy and twisted Thomas. We never really get more than hints at his true intentions, but Cassel makes every moment on-screen simply amazing. Kunis delivers a level of depth I never thought was possible for her. She commands the screen with every new scene, and this performance will easily act as a starmaking role for her. Hershey is even better; practically stealing the screen away from Portman's magnetizing performance. She makes Erica into that monster of a character everyone loves to hate, and brings a level of intensity to every mere moment she appears in. If anyone is even nearly close to equaling Portman's performance, it would be her. Despite only appearing for a few minutes, Winona Ryder is amazing in her role as the former lead ballerina Beth. I just wish she could have chewed up more scenery.Black Swan is an incredible film from beginning to end, and will not easily leave you. It is a masterpiece of unheralded success, and is easily the best film I saw at TIFF. Watch out for it at Oscar time – it just may steal the show.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Swan Dive into Darkness,"Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" makes ballet cool—and if that isn't a Herculean feat in itself, I don't know what is. It also happens to be one of the best films of the year, featuring one of the best performances of the year. Natalie Portman will be nominated for her devastating portrayal of petite perfectionist Nina the ballerina or I'll pull a Werner Herzog and eat my shoe.""Black Swan"" is cut from the same cloth as Aronofsky's 2008 film ""The Wrestler,"" if at the opposite end. Interestingly, before either project was realized, the director was reportedly mulling a drama about the relationship between a professional wrestler and a ballerina. Somewhere along the way, however, that concept was split down the middle—and thank God. ""Black Swan"" is brilliant, but it wouldn't necessarily play well with others.Like its predecessor, the film examines a physically demanding and widely unappreciated art, and though thematically similar, the two complement each other via mutually exclusive cinematic vernaculars. ""The Wrestler"" is ultimately a safer film. Its emotional experience is directly conveyed via plot and dialogue. What Aronofsky attempts with ""Black Swan"" is riskier: he plays genre Frankenstein, taking established themes and transplanting them into that which feels initially least appropriate—horror.Yet despite certain unmistakable cues, I'd hesitate to call ""Black Swan"" a horror film. Visually, maybe, but John Carpenter insists ""The Thing"" is a Western, and likewise there is more to ""Black Swan"" than is aesthetically obvious. It probably best fits the psychological thriller mold, but as Aronofsky suggests through his manipulation of mirrors, it is not a film that ever casts a clear reflection. For me, that dichotomy is what makes it so fascinating and rewarding.""Black Swan"" strikes an immediate haunting note that seems to grow louder with reverberation rather than quieter. In the first half, the director lays track work; in the second, he runs right off it. Nina begins her journey receiving the coveted role of the Swan Queen in a modernist production of Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake."" Her practiced technique makes her ideal for the role of the goodly White Swan, but her lascivious director (Vincent Cassel) has reservations about her ability to portray her evil twin, the titular Black Swan—a character that embodies impulse and lust. Nina's process of unlearning takes her to increasingly dark, surreal depths.The final act of the film comprises the most riveting 40 minutes I've seen on screen all year, though ""Black Swan"" is never the mindf**k some have improperly labeled it. Aronofsky deliberately builds atmosphere and anticipation toward a Kubrickian climax that is at once obvious and stunning. Tchaikovsky's score falls like an aerial assault, and that inherent theatricality collides with Aronofsky's narrative as they come to a dual boil.Perhaps best of all, however, is that for all the audacity on display, the director knows when to dial it back as well. The casting of Mila Kunis (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" ""That 70's Show"") was idyllic. She plays a comic relief of sorts, with a comely, down-to-earth veneer but viperous eyes. Her performance is fantastically calculated—she provides derisive, but much needed perspective on Nina's deteriorating sense of reality.""Black Swan"" is a wholly effective work born from the shadowy underside of the mind, anchored by a career-defining turn by Portman. It is a quick, impulsive piece, but it explains artistic devotion and the consuming nature of obsession as well or better than any film I've ever seen. In hindsight, it feels more characteristic of the filmmaker responsible for ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"" than ""The Wrestler,"" though the parallels between it and ""Black Swan"" run deep.They may be cut from the same cloth, but the difference between the two is as stark as black and white. Hail Aronofsky, the Swan King.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""Perfect""","I had the opportunity to see Black Swan in one of the 18 theaters that it opened up on this weekend, although I generally do not do so, I was compelled to write a review of the film.From top to bottom, this film is at the height of what it means to be true art in cinema. The various elements of the film, the mise-en-scene, was so incredibly structured by filmmaker Darren Aronofsky that one need only sit back and admire at the fluidity of his camera movement, or the marvelous hue of colors amidst a film which has it's color scheme largely dedicated to the symbolism of black and white.The performances where spot on, Vincent Cassel was terrific as the suspicious teacher, whose brilliance and lust for the dancers in his show are both quite reputable, one often beating out the other. And Mila Kunis truly shines in this one, bringing out a side of her many probably didn't know was possible. She is absolutely beautiful and aptly portrays the black contradiction to Natalie Portmans white, a terrific contrast of good and evil. Kunis, however, as many may assume, is not meant to be there to spark a general conflict of good vs evil, but to emphasize the side of Portman that we have not yet seen. A side that will drive her to the brink of insanity to obtain.And therein lies the true theme of the film, obsession and physical strain over all else. Much like ""The Wrestler"" we have the main character dedicated to an unappreciated form of physical art. Here, it is Portman's obsession with becoming the lead of the ballet Swan Lake which drives her into madness. You enter her mind as her teacher pushes her to become perfect, pushing her to let go of her fragile White Swan and become the loose and destructive Black Swan. As you follow her through the stages of her audition leading towards a booming finale she becomes less and less aware of what around her is distortion and what is reality. As she loses grip, Aronofsky's ability to depict psychological deterioration shines through.And make no mistake, this film belongs to Aronofsky and Portman. As stated, Aronofsky captures everything beautifully in frame, his movement of the camera is almost as fluent and beautiful as the very dancers on the screen. His use of behind the head vantage shots has been a bit of a trademark of his, allowing as to see what the character is. And his use of lighting is nothing short of extraordinary. But now comes the true star: Natalie Portman. She blew me away, from start to finish, she displayed her transformation for the sweet girl to the physically and psychologically obsessed, all the way through attempting to embody the white and black swan when necessary, literally trying to become them in her mind, driving her towards insanity in the pursuit of perfection. Words cannot describe Portman's performance here, to say it is Oscar worthy would be a vast understatement, as the depth of her character goes so deep it would nearly be worthy of playing two separate roles. So fragile at time that you fear for her life, and so corrupted at others that you hate her. Acting at it's finest, Portman deserves an Oscar.All things considered the film is nearly perfect, one of the best dramas I've ever seen, and one that is as iconic and intense as it is horrifying at times. Just to mention a few other things, Winona Ryder, in the small amount of screen time she had, was spectacular, and truly terrifying during particular scenes. And as always, when Aronofsky and Clint Mansell team up, the score is both epic and eerie, somehow simultaneously. The overcasting score of a distorted and intense version of Swan Lake itself brilliantly compliments the atmosphere throughout the film as these two artist have done before. It could nearly work as a silent film, that's how brilliant it is. If you get the opportunity once this film undoubtedly expands to other theaters see it, it's harrowing and at times difficult to watch, but that combination of beauty and horror makes it impossible to turn away.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Film is mostly enjoyable when viewed as a dark fairy tale,"Remembered hype for this film when it was out in cinema back in 2011 but never viewed, would've been around 13 years old at the time. Completely forgot about film but stumbled on it on Netflix recently in 2023.In my opinion this film is best viewed as a sort of dark fairy tale similar to Argento's Suspiria. As a psychological drama it is somewhat unsettling but not nearly as unsettling or downright unpleasant as psychological dramas like The Machinist or the Piano Teacher.A lot of the critical reviews on this site of this film criticize the one dimensional characters of this film which is understandable. But when the very first scene after the opening credits is a dream sequence with the main character dancing with a man in a goblin costume, that should tip the viewer off that this film has strong dark fantasy elements thus having archetypal or rather one dimensional characters is not out of place.I can see why I had not heard of this film since then because it is not very deep or something you ponder after viewing. But all in all I give 8/10.-",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Engaging psychological horror despite not being as ""high-brow"" as the ballet frame suggests","Esteemed IMDb writer Theo Robertson messaged me the other day about this film and, while I skimmed it for fear of having him influence me in terms of his opinion, I did read that several older people had walked out of this film, seemingly having expected some sort of high-brow film with its roots in ballet. One can understand why because with all the award buzz and the superficial subject matter (ballet) combined with the actress and of course the previous work of the director, this must surely be an intelligent piece to be ""appreciated"" and ""considered"". What one wouldn't expect would be a film that, with a bit more gore, could easily be just another trashy horror/thriller that is released on video and has plenty of sex, violence and jump scares to it.Well, got news for you, this is what Black Swan is – albeit a superior example of the genre. Essentially our lead character struggles to get in touch with her dark side when she wins the lead in Swan Lake, gradually losing touch with reality and/or being hunted by those around her who wish her harm. This manifests itself through some painful scenes of self-harm, imagined doppelgangers, intense sexual discovery, shadowy figures and a domineering mother who keeps her controlling menace under a veil of vulnerability that only falls here or there. It is trashy stuff in a way but it is done very well so that it produces this genre material but does so in a way that feels slightly classy while also engaging more than it would thanks to a brilliant turn by Portman.And she is brilliant. I understand the mother because of how well Portman plays – this is not a character she has worked on for a few months, this feels like a product of years under the influence of this mother. She is nervous to her core, frustrated by her own inability to be this ""thing"" that she has spent her life not being – wild, loose, imperfect. Portman nails it and while I don't think it is a brilliant film, her performance is little less than brilliant. In support Hersey is equally as good with less time to do it. The flickers across her face say so much and I was impressed that with so little I was able to understand roughly what had happened in the previous 20 years. Cassel is simplistic but effective in his predatory director turn. Kunis is unbelievably sexual and again she helps the lead role by showing us everything that Nina struggles to find in herself. Ryder is solid in a smaller role. Aronofsky's direction is strong but particularly impressive is the cinematography – the camera flows so well around the scenes (and yet appears in no mirrors). I think he knows he is making a horror movie so, although he embraces the ballet, he doesn't avoid the shock or the build of the horror.Some have embraced this film as art and a thing of beauty – while others have come away disappointed because that is what they expected it to be but didn't find it. However Black Swan is an effective psychological horror movie that just happens to be set in the world of ballet. As such it is very much a genre movie even if the director etc lift it to feel like more. In particular Portman makes the film – I cannot think I have seen her better and her Oscar (can there be doubt?) will be deserved.",,Anonymous,Drama
Mediocre,"I really don't understand what so many reviewers saw in this movie. I don't want to overreact and say it is terrible, but there is nothing in it that inspires or makes one think. It is a well made film. The directing is good, the performance by Natalie Portman is very believable. However, the problem with the movie is that Nina - the main character is flat and uninteresting. Right from the beginning of the movie the viewer is lead to believe that Nina is good, but all I saw is a confused and obsessed individual. She does not love anyone, she has no friends, she does not care about anyone... The only bright spot is her dream to become a leading ballerina in a Swan Lake production, however the movie never really explains why this dream is important to her, and for this reason it is hard to see this dream as anything but another of Nina's obsessions. In short, I just didn't find anything in this movie worth watching. And while I can't say I regret watching it, I would not recommend it either.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Intellectual-Camp,"I had a lot of fun watching the gorgeous Natalie Portman go through her pirouettes. A film that runs the gamut from ""The Red Shoes"" to ""Repulsion"" without reaching the heights of those masterpieces it manages to be an original opus from one of the most interesting directors of late. Darren Aronofsky's confidence is overwhelming. I regret I'll be dead and buried by the time Natalie Portman is 50 but I would give anything to see what this wonderful actress will be by that age. Here, she goes through the motions without avoiding any of the enormous difficulties her character requires. Vincent Cassel plays the French choreographer with a touch of Dhiagelev and oodles of sex appeal. Winona Ryder gives the film its campy touches, which makes the whole enterprise much more accessible than it seems at first. I enjoyed it very much even if I was aware of the effort to be seriously intellectual.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Remarkable..  Aronofsky holds nothing back,"Yeah, it must be Darren Aronofsky, at it again. I'm certain I've just seen a brilliant piece of filmmaking, but at the same time I feel like I've just been run over by a convoy of trucks. It will be a while before I calm down enough to sleep, so here I am.Not everyone is as big as of an Aronofsky's style as I am, but one thing that can't be denied is that he is great at working with actors. Ellen Burstyn, Mickey Rourke, and now Natalie Portman are all very accomplished actors who have found a new level and delivered transcendent performances under Aronofsky. In Black Swan, Natalie Portman's turn as Nina Sayers is, hands down, the best acting performance of 2010-- male or female. If you'll forgive the cliché, I completely forgot Nina was Natalie Portman about five minutes into the movie. As Nina goes deeper and deeper into her role as the Swan Queen, Portman only becomes more and more captivating. The entire cast is excellent, but Portman alone makes this movie a must-see.Darren Aronofsky is at his boldest heading up Black Swan. His depiction of Nina's struggles as she succumbs to growing pressures from her director, her mother, her rivals, her physical ailments, her personal need for a perfect performance.. it is intense, thrilling, exhausting, and truly gripping throughout. Part of what makes it work is that we are completely along for the ride with Nina. We see what she sees, we experience what she experiences, and sometimes it is truly distressing stuff.As great as the first 60-70 minutes are, man oh man, nothing can prepare you for the final 30. This finale takes you to places I can't even describe. I dare say it's on par with Requiem for a Dream's devastating third act. It's a masterfully crafted climax that only Aronofsky could deliver.I am glad Aronofsky is able to do what he does. His brutal and uncompromising style is definitely not for everyone, and it's not box office gold, but for those viewers who connect with what he's doing, the experience is truly something special.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Overrated,"Natalie did deserve her Oscar, but the movie overall is extremely boring. The first hour is agonizing, and then, after some 65 minutes, something finally begins to happen and the finale is great.

Absolutely amazing.,"I was lucky enough to see this at the Austin Film Festival and was absolutely blow away.Aronofsky is, in many ways, like Nick Cave. You know going in that you are going to get something gritty, raw, and real. You know that, even if it's good, it's going to be hard to process. But when he gets a hold of something, really gets a hold of it, you won't be able to look away, no matter how hard it is to watch. He is a singular filmmaker in the regard that he can create something that is both visceral and cerebral at the same time. Others can do this, but few as well. What he does is never hollow, shallow, or empty, it is always dense, deep, and rich with everything that makes film great.""Black Swan"" is no exception. In many ways this is the most Aronofsky of his films. His style is spot on and works exquisitely with the world he is presenting. It's surprising because he normally shows the dirty, gritty, and ugly places, where as everything in this film is clean and polished. But don't let that fool you, he saved the dirt and grit for the characters. It's remarkable that the man who was able to show the sensitive, and vulnerable side of a wrestler is also able to show the brutal and hard side of a ballerina? For starters, this film looks amazing. The production design, specifically the use of black and white in contrast (don't spend time looking for this, it's everywhere and you will miss something if you do) does it's job without feeling invasive. The lighting is brilliant, as is the staging of the dance scenes. I'm still stunned that the same eye that brought the grainy subway bathroom of ""Pi"" to life is the same eye that brings all this rich and beautiful color so clearly to the screen.He also does a brilliant job of creating the world that these characters inhabit. This film reminded me of all the terrible parts of my theater days. The backstabbing, the trash talking, and the two faced nature of that world is portrayed with a deft and brilliant touch. There is a constant fear that you are one mistake away from losing not only your part, but your future parts as well. You feel like you are a part of this world, that he pressure of it is part of your world.The camera work is great, if a little typical of Aronofsky at times (we see the backs of heads quite a bit, it works, but you see it a lot), but it is very affective. The somewhat jittery, close hand-held shots are perfect and pull you deeper into this world than may be comfortable.Then there are the name performances. Of the name actors you mostly get what you expect. Portman, Cassel, Hershey, and Rider are outstanding. The only real shock, for me anyway, is Mila Kunis. I know her as Jackie from ""That 70's Show,"" and nothing else. She damned near steals the show. That's right, in a move where she shares screen with Natalie Portman, AND Vincent Cassel she is able to not only hold her own, but walk away with some scenes. The interplay between her wild, unrestrained Lilly, and Portman's frightened, tightly wound Nina creates a brilliant external tension to match, and at times overpower, the internal tension that lies at the very core of Nina.I have been a fan of Aronofsky's work since I saw ""Pi"" on it's original theatrical run ( I think I was the only person in the theater for that midnight show), and he has yet to disappoint. He has a definite point of view and a thematic core that runs through his work. Thematically, this is in keeping with most of Aronofsky's work. It's about control and the loss of that control. What happens when a perfectionist control freak is in a position where she HAS to let go of that control? What takes over when she does let go? In typical fashion, Aronofsky shows us that sometimes in striving to get what we want, we risk losing a part of us that we may never be able to get back, and don't realize how desperately we need.Read more from me at www.thefilmthugs.com",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
An epic and nightmarish delight,"Natalie Portman lives a dream and a nightmare when she gets a chance to dance Swan Lake in Darren Aronofsky's new filmBlack Swan is a very bi polarized film. Portman dances as the white swan flawlessly, but her 'brilliant' choreographer has doubts about her as the black swan. She needs to 'live a little' and be less mannered, but the closer she gets to that point, the more the walls start to close in all around her.Darren Aronofsky, though he comes close to being heavy handed, has delivered a project which is fiery, spectacular and clever. He sells us ballet as something dark and off putting, starting from his decision to reveal what dancing does to peoples bodies. One mistake and you can crack a toe nail under your body weight, but I don't wanna oversell it. To look at Black Swan in another way, it is an operatic horror film, It has incredible style, but uses it not so much to dazzle but to confuse and intimidate. The paradox of Black swan is that it creepiness is kind of seductive, because it draws you in (much like the way vampires are supposedly romantic)But style is only half the picture (not even). The rest is in the cast, and mostly in Natalie Portman. She is slow to get started, but she grows quickly and the result is arguably her best performance yet. I've never loved her that much. She's always struck me as more of a girl than a woman, but I guess all she needs is to get a little blood on her hands, and you have an award worthy performance. Vincent Cassel, though he gets some questionable lines, is also at his best. I would have almost liked to see more of him, because you get the sense that his role has a bit more room to grow.Black Swan does quite a bit, but it's not for everyone. Do not go into this expecting to be emotionally enriched. From the beginning, it is staged to be a mind-twirl, delighting in playing tricks on the audience. Some might call it cheating, but that would be the wrong way to look at Black Swan. It's quite epic, and with year coming to an end, I think it's fair to say that it is among the best of 2010.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Good and The Bad,"I was very lucky to snag tickets to see Black Swan at the the Toronto International Film Festival.THE GOOD: Natalie Portman's acting was perfection - definitely an Oscar worthy performance. Mila Kunis's performance was surprising in a good way, it is clear that she stepped out of her comfort zone. The film's musical score was superb. Of course, much of it was taken from 'Swan Lake', but I loved that they were able to incorporate that music throughout the entire film and not just in the ballet scenes. Of course, it was beautifully shot and the plot was riveting - I was drawn in from beginning to end. The audience saw a new side of ballet/ theatre that is not often shown in popular films - the struggle the performer faces in committing to and perfecting a role. The struggle between 'good' vs. 'evil' was presented in a methodical and intriguing way.THE BAD: Many parts of this film felt like it belonged in the horror Genre. Some parts definitely made me jump or cringe (which I was not expecting). The film was also an emotional roller-coaster, which was fine at first, but This 'emotional roller-coaster' sort of dragged on to the point that it almost felt like it was too much. I just feel that it could have been tuned down a notch.Overall, I thought that most of the film was wonderful, and I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A seductive masterpiece,"Darren Aronofsky proves once again that he is an absolute genius in the modern world of cinema and he can work in any genre and make it look beautiful, real, visceral, and always keeping with his specific visual style, proving himself to be an absolute auteur. Black Swan is Aronofsky's fifth feature film, and it shows how his directing ability is somehow getting better. The movie is about a ballet dancer, Nina (Natalie Portman), who is dealing with the pressures of playing The Swan Queen in her companies production of Swan Lake. The pressures brought about by this demanding role cause her to begin to slowly crack under pressure, especially when she has to worry about a rival dancer possibly taking her spot. My synopsis doesn't do the film any justice though, and the result of this story is a disturbing and breath taking thriller that combines beauty with visceral intensity, and keeps you on the edge of your seat and your eyes glued to the screen.Aronofsky's directing style is incredibly sophisticated and mature in this film. It is grand and beautiful. The ballet scenes are all very delicate and soft, yet there's always an underlying tension. This tension eventually breaks through as the film at times switches to a much darker and more disturbing mood. We are lulled into a false sense of security in many aspects of the film, as it builds and builds to the shocking and chilling climax. The movie flows so beautifully and it delicately weaves in and out of its multitude of moods that keeps us watching and waiting, as the film only grows darker and darker. As the moods of the film change, the style does as well in a very minuscule range, but it is always fitting wherever the film moves. Black Swan is sensual, seductive, lustful, and intense, and Aronofsky's direction captures it all perfectly.With a style as complex and masterful as Aronofsky's, it is hard for any aspect of the film to look bad, but this wasn't a problem because I felt that every aspect of this film was nearly flawless. One such aspect was the brilliant acting from the small yet very important cast that really helped a movie that needed no help at all. Natalie Portman as Nina was incredible. Her transformation through the movie is disturbing and very intense, and Portman handles it incredibly well. She plays a very flawed character, making the role even tougher. Nina is not the greatest ballet dancer in the world by any stretch of the imagination. She has all the technique and is in fact a master at it, yet it is her emotion that she has the problem with. Portman almost had to act her character poorly to capture the multiple layers correctly. The unfitting facial expressions and awkward movements are part of the character of Nina, and Portman somehow makes it all work to a great advantage that makes the film even more fascinating.The rest of the cast is incredible as well. Mila Kunis takes on a much more serious and more complex role than she is used to. Her character has very many layers, and doesn't fit into one specific archetype, mainly for reasons that would spoil the movie. Vincent Cassel is the sleazy and inappropriate director of this ballet production. He is the driving force behind much of the tragedy of the film, and he is a character you love to hate. Then perhaps one of the most disturbing characters is Barbara Hershey as Erica, Nina's mother. Erica lives vicariously through her daughter and is constantly pushing her to better while also sheltering her from the world and everything that is out there past ballet. She is the reason for Nina's rigid structure in her life that is a constant pressure to do better. The introduction of Erica's true motivation is one of the most stunning and tragic elements of the movie. We are shown only a facade of the mother at the beginning of the film, being tricked into believing that Nina and her mother live a happy and beautiful life together as a loving mother and daughter. But further down the road as the film grows darker we realize just how skewed and disturbed their relationship is. It is a great bit of character development that has a very important role in the films overall progression.If I could use one word to describe Black Swan it would be seductive. The movie is ripe with sexual tension, and it drags you in whether you want to be or not. It grabs ahold of your attention, as well as your emotions. The film is so beautiful, yet so tense and so powerful. It fascinates and hypnotizes, and you want nothing more than to know what is going to happen to these people in this disturbed story. It is a film that wraps itself around your brain, rendering you speechless for its entire length. There is just something so unique and so incredible about this film that it almost felt awkward stepping back into reality when it was all over. Black Swan is a masterpiece, and definitely one of the best of 2010.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Overdone Melodrama,"This is a film I've been meaning to watch for years, so naturally I built up some pretty high expectations over time. I went into 'Black Swan' expecting nothing but greatness I mean, how could I not? Almost everything about it sounds great: an intriguing female protagonist, a plot centred around the themes of pressure and sanity, set within an intimidating theatrical environment, and on top of that, starring Natalie Portman and Vincent Cassel. There is so much potential in all of this for a masterful art house tour de force, but unfortunately only a small portion of that potential is actually utilised.'Black Swan', although rich in clever symbolism and captivating performances, feels like a complete and utter mess in terms of tone and style. In regards to genre, this film is classified as a ""thriller/drama""... but it feels like a ""melodrama"" more than anything, and surprisingly, not due to the performances, but due to its obnoxiously bizarre editing choices. There are countless scenes throughout the film which would have worked so much better if they weren't presented in such an over-the-top manner; scenes that feature raw emotion and truly praise-worthy work from the incredibly talented Natalie Portman - which unfortunately can't be fully appreciated due to the distracting soundtrack being constantly used out of place, as well as abrupt cuts which only seem to be there in an attempt to make the given scene feel more ""energetic"". It really is frustrating, as all the ""energy"" that is required is fully provided by the actors themselves; the technical additions just feel forced and eventually become irritating. Almost all of the editing and tonal choices are constructed so poorly and even worse, they just felt so damn unnecessary.The tone even shifts into the territory of ""horror"", and I don't mean cleverly constructed tension or even some of that Lynchian mastery, what I mean is terrible jump ""scares"" that fail to fulfil their basic purpose - I'm talking about the type of jump scares you'd expect in the lowest tier of juvenile ""horror"" films. Jump scares, despite sounding cheap, can be done well - David Lynch certainly proved this in his films but that's definitely not what we receive here, what we receive here is some obnoxious editing that feels like it was slapped together by an edgy teenager because of how corny it feels. This is just one of the few aspects that felt awkwardly out of place, it's as if one of the purposes of this film is to try and distract you from the truly wonderful performances provided by the entire cast, which is truly unfortunate, especially concerning Natalie Portman and Vincent Cassel - these two in particular were perfectly cast and kept me glued to the screen throughout the entire run-time of the film, despite its annoying distractions. The acting and the script are the only aspects that made me give this film an ""above average"" rating, they are also the only aspects which made this film worth watching, just about everything else brings it down and ultimately makes it a frustrating viewing experience.In conclusion, 'Black Swan' just feels like wasted potential - it feels like a masterpiece trapped within a mediocre execution. Despite my harsh words, it is a film I would recommend watching at least once for the performances alone; Natalie Portman gives one of the best performances of her career and truly captivates from start to finish. There's even some clever symbolism based on the themes implemented throughout, but just like with the acting, it's difficult to appreciate with all the distracting nonsense thrown on top of it. I'm giving 'Black Swan' a mild 6,4/10 - there is definitely a great film within, so it really is quite a shame that it had to be executed this way.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Black Swan- Oscar's for Best Film and Natalie Portman?,"I will not give away any spoilers so as not to possibly ruin the experience for anyone, but I can say that this movie left me shaking when it was over. What did I just see? I know I was caught up and went for the entire ride from the opening scene till the very end. The reaction of the audience was evident as the end credits came. NO ONE left their seats. They sat and applauded loudly the names as they scrolled up, then upon the very last credit on the screen, they applauded loudly again.It's a brilliant piece of film making and story telling and acting. ""Black Swan"", as well as ""The King's Speech"", will DOMINATE at the 2011 Oscars and Golden Globes and whatever other films awards show there is... AND deservedly so.I am anxious to see the film again right away with friends, but will actually wait to continue to savor the feeling the initial viewing of the film still illicit in me. It was a thrilling time and I am looking forward to seeing just how successful this film will become and what my friends and family will say.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Black Swan Bleak on More Than One level,"Black Swan has garnered more than a few glowing reviews and has collected a list of awards nominations to match (among others, the Golden Globes will consider Natalie Portman as Best Actress, Mila Kunis as Best Supporting Actress, Darren Aronofsky as Best Director, and the film itself as Best Drama). I made it my mission in life to see it before the awards ceremonies started. It could be that my expectations were too high, but I was frankly not as impressed by Black Swan as many critics seem to be.Black Swan is a reference to the white Swan Queen's opposite in the famous ballet, Swan Lake. Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a technically brilliant dancer in a New York ballet company who desperately wants to snag the dual role. The problem? The dance company's director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) tells her she's the perfect Swan Queen, but that she lacks the passion and emotional abandon of her Black Swan twin.The pressure on Nina to prove the director wrong is considerable. Her mother (Barbara Hershey)—a retired ballerina herself—exerts considerable control over her daughter in the guise of kindness and support. The company's aging prima ballerina (Winona Ryder) is volatile and dramatic, particularly when she learns she's soon to be giving her final performance before a retirement that isn't her idea. And a new dancer from San Francisco (Lily, played by Mila Kunis), quickly becomes both Nina's friend and bitter rival.Lily, very much a free spirit, spreads her attitude wherever she goes and Nina needs it more than most. Thomas, meanwhile, is inclined to use any means necessary to inspire the performance he wants out of her. As Nina's life spins beyond her ability to control, her emotions and her sanity both begin to wear thin. But her focus on dance becomes ever more laser-like as she determines that nothing will stop her from being the perfect ballerina.Natalie Portman reportedly lost some 20 pounds from her already tiny frame to more authentically portray a dedicated dancer. She and Kunis alike spent months studying ballet as well. Their efforts show. While a few more complicated maneuvers were performed by doubles, much of what you see on screen is really done by the actors themselves. Their acting, too, is superlative. Vincent Cassel is also good, but Barbara Hershey is brilliant as the overbearing mother whose demands for perfection set Nina on her course from childhood. Kudos, too, to Winona Ryder. Her role is small, but it's memorable.Director Darren Aronofsky, perhaps best known for his previous award-winning film The Wrestler, does a credible job here. There are interesting edits and camera effects everywhere, and he does seem to know well how to elicit a stellar performance from his cast. I'm not a ballet fan, so I can't vouch for the authenticity of the dancing here, but it certainly looked lovely on screen and was a nice counterpoint to some of the seamier visions interspersed.BOTTOM LINE Despite the obvious quality of the crafting of Black Swan, I didn't really like it all that much. That may be because there were so many moments where the sheer brilliance of the acting or some technical aspect in the making of the scene actually overshadowed the story itself. I found myself all too conscious of those things rather than paying attention to what was really going on. In many ways, Black Swan was the proverbial ""too much of a good thing."" I can't fault those who claim Black Swan is a well-made movie. I just can't pretend that I personally enjoyed it very much. The quality of filmmaking alone gave Black Swan its six stars. Whether or not my interest held up throughout garnered considerably less.POLITICAL NOTES None.FAMILY SUITABILITY Black Swan is rated R for ""strong sexual content, disturbing violent images, language and some drug use."" All of those cautions are entirely too real. Black Swan is not a movie for children, or even for young teens. An R rating is entirely appropriate, and movie-goers should take note. I'd add that, while I wasn't particularly happy with my movie-going experience, I can't deny that there are reasons to see Black Swan, not least among them some very strong performances indeed.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Losing Yourself In The Darkness Of The Part,"First off let no one think that if they see Black Swan from 2010 that earned Natalie Portman a Best Actress Oscar that they are looking at a remake of the Tyrone Power swashbuckling classic. Instead this film which has a setting in a ballet company is an interesting combination of plot themes from A Double Life and All About Eve.Company choreographer Victor Cassel chooses promising newcomer Natalie Portman to be the lead in his new production of Swan Lake to succeed his long time star Winona Ryder who is not taking her forced retirement easy. Portman has been Ryder's Eve Harrington, but Portman also has an Eve in her life as well, the younger and talented Mila Kunis. A lot of fine roles for women in this film.Portman is no doubt talented, but she's dealing with a lot of issues of paranoia, a lot of it instilled by her mother Barbara Hershey. She starts losing herself in the dark complexities of the Black Swan as surely as Ronald Colman did with Othello in A Double Life. How it all works out for all the women you have to see Black Swan.And you'll like what you see. It's hard to miss the elements in those classics that I've cited in Black Swan. But if you're going to borrow, borrow from the best. And since an Oscar came Ronald Colman's way and one of her 10 nominations came Bette Davis's way, Natalie Portman sure had a substantial role that she played beautifully.The real surprise for most viewers I think will be Mila Kunis who played the vapid Jackie on That Seventies Show. Kunis provided one of the great lines from television in that show when she stated that no one would deter her from her career goal to be Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader. She should have gotten some Oscar recognition herself for the Eve Harrington type role she plays here.Black Swan is the best film about ballet since the Anne Bancroft/Shirley MacLane classic The Turning Point from the Seventies. Try to see this one by all means.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""Perfect""","I have to say, I am blown away by the performances in this film. The entire ensemble along with the camerawork and directing made this film so creepy, trippy and terrifying.The utter beauty in so much pain, suffering and paranoia is enough to make anyone go to greater lengths than they had ever imagined.Wow. Just wow. Natalie Portman was phenomenal. I completely forgot this was a movie and it felt as if I was watching it all unfold in front of my eyes.What I find so beautiful and unique about this film is there was never a moment where I was extremely uncomfortable and wanting to run away from the screen. Just pressing the pause button gave me anxiety. It just shows how truly encapsulating films can be when everything is executed ""perfectly.""I am still in shock writing this. I truly can see why Natalie Portman received an Oscar for her performance.One last thing: As a singer, actor and performer, the emotions Nina felt while taking the role of two characters was all too familiar. Method acting is more of a curse rather than a blessing. As someone who has experienced it firsthand, it destroys you from the inside and makes you someone you aren't, which I guess is the point. But with Nina, it went too far before she could be saved, and her insanity and lust for her performance is what was inevitably her undoing.The mind is an evil and deceiving menace. So many performers sacrifice everything they are to reach the depths of Nina, and many forget their entire persona, whether short lived or long lived.Truly, truly, bravo.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Black swan song,"Darren Aronofsky is a filmmaker who, over the course of five films, has thoroughly explored the various ways in which people can be consumed when their passions become self-destructive obsessions. It seems to be a bit of an obsession in and of itself for Aronofsky, and frankly, I've been with him every step of the way. The best cinema is the kind that makes you feel something, which Aronofsky's work does in spades. Taking up residence in the darkest recesses of the human psyche is no picnic.Nina Sayers has toiled for years and years in Thomas Leroy's New York ballet company. Having fallen on hard times, Leroy exiles his lead dancer and hopes that a fresh face in the company's upcoming version of ""Swan Lake"" will renew interest and revenue. Nina believes that she has what it takes to tackle the role of Swan Queen, and while Thomas chooses her for the part, he is adamant about her being able to nail both the pure innocence of the White Swan and the dark, sultry essence of the Black Swan. He doesn't feel that she is yet capable of pulling off the latter, but he suspects that she has the ability bottled up inside. Nina, ever the perfectionist, just needs to let herself go and perhaps explore her sexuality. Unfortunately, she's had to deal with an overbearing mother who has sheltered her to the point of psychological damage. Experiencing what she needs to in order to embody the Black Swan, combined with the pressure of the role and the paranoia over new girl, Lily, possibly being after her spot, may just push Nina over the edge.""Black Swan"" has been cited as a companion piece to ""The Wrestler"", and in many ways, it is. They even share similar instances of a pseudo-documentary shooting style. However, whereas the latter utilized such a style to create a heightened sense of realism, ""Black Swan"" takes the approach and creates a claustrophobic hell akin to something like Polanski's ""The Tenant"". It's a disorienting portrait of the madness that infects many who possess the desire to create art. Nina's sanity is in question early on, and from there, we are kept on our toes in relation to what is hallucinated and what is real. Speaking of being kept on one's toes, we get an up close look at how hard ballet is on the human body. As if the psychological turmoil wasn't enough for poor Nina, the physical toll is just as prominent.As the ballerina seeking the pinnacle of perfection, Natalie Portman achieves that which her character so desperately desires. Her performance is a milestone, not only in her career, but in acting, period. Every ounce of praise directed toward her is richly deserved. Nina goes through a ringer of emotional changes, be it the sweet, delicate girl she starts out as, the rebellious grown-up Lily unleashes in her or the manic frenzy she's reduced to when things really get out of hand. Portman never misses a beat. When I first heard that Mila Kunis had been cast as Lily, I wasn't exactly thrilled. I'm happy to say that I was wrong about her, as she is terrific here. She made me forget all about her role on ""That 70's Show"". Vincent Cassel is also fantastic as Thomas Leroy, and his relationship with Nina is one of the film's strongest aspects. He had serious doubts about her, but he believed in her all the same. Enough so that he put his doubts aside and took the biggest possible risk on her. Barbara Hershey is unnerving as Nina's overprotective mother, and Winona Ryder makes the most of her brief role as Beth, the aging star whom Nina replaces.Matthew Libatique's cinematography is beautifully realized. Combining the raw grittiness of the pseudo-documentary material with the nightmarish imagery of Nina's hallucinations and the elegance of the ballet, the film is a joy to behold. Clint Mansell's music, complete with elements from ""Swan Lake"", is also amazing, just as much a character as any breathing person on screen. I was disappointed that Mansell didn't have more of a presence in ""The Wrestler"", so I was happy to have him back in full force with ""Black Swan"".Aronofsky is my favorite director to come along in the last 20 years or so. ""Pi"" was a solid debut, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is an utter masterpiece (still my favorite film in general), ""The Fountain"" is an underrated gem and ""The Wrestler"" is a strong character study. I'm pleased, but not surprised, to say that ""Black Swan"" is another film that further solidifies his position as a master filmmaker. As for Portman, she doesn't need the ""Best Actress"" Oscar to solidify how great she is. Besides, after Sandra Bullock ""won"" last year, they'll obviously give that award to anybody.",,Anonymous,Drama
Overrated,"I can already see that most reviewers won't agree, but: this movie is overrated in my opinion.I will just briefly say: the actors are really good, so is the camera and artwork and yes, the characters do represent some interesting psychologic constellations.But overall nothing about it seems brilliant (except perhaps for camera and artwork, which create a very tense atmosphere): the characters portrayed, a girl who cannot realize an own sexual identity and has to pay for preventing her mothers career by being born; a mother who has given up on life since she failed to become a ballerina and now makes her daughter suffer for her loss while at the same time, lives through her and forces the daughter to live her mother's lost dream. All of this has been portrayed before and much better. There is no ""beyond"" this in the movie, the rest is exploration of the scenario with endless ""thrills for entertainment"". Neither does the lucid nightmare portray ballet, nor the music, nor the characters in a credible way. One can accept the hallucinative horror episodes as some surrealistic form of storytelling, but the very bold symbolism they incorporate makes it just less credible and nowhere deeper.Afterall the movie works somewhat similar as any teeny slasher: shocks for entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Well Directed But Let Down By Frustrating Story Telling,"Black swan by Darran Aronofsky continues the director's body that will split audiences and critics to two extreme camps . . Certainly those who thought REQUIEM FOR A DREAM was an unsung masterpiece will probably have a higher opinion of it since SWAN shows Aronofsky's influences that are as diverse as Cronenberg's work from the 1970s and German expressionist cinemaThis is not to say that SWAN is a horror film per se and this is the fundamental problem - the audience are continually being led up a Lovecraftian garden path by screenwriters Heinz , Hayman and McLaughlin where things seem metaphysical rather than psychological . Things happen that are never made clear as to why they're happening and this culminates in the final scene which does ruin the film to a large extent . It should also be remembered that REQUIEM was effectively a modern day expressionistic horror film where as this movie isn't . It's more in the vein of a sexual Heart Of Darkness set against the background of balletThat said Aronofsky isn't too interested in destinations , he's concentrating on the journey and it 's a journey that is compelling for the most part . Portman is a certainty for Best Actress at the Oscars but Mila Kunis and Vincent Cassel are both equally memorable in their supporting roles . Like Aronofsky's previous movies the technical aspects such as editing and cinematography are superb but you're left thinking that the more prestigious prize ceremonies will give out their awards to films that are more audience friendly . But this is isn't a criticism of Aronofsky who is just about the most interesting and original director working today and one hopes never to see him compromise his style for the mainstream",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Unstable ballerina loses grip on reality and becomes The Black Swan...,"It's easy to see that Darren Aronofsky was influenced by the classic THE RED SHOES ('48), except that the '48 film did not telegraph its tragic ending which came as somewhat of an abrupt surprise. On the other hand, BLACK SWAN telegraphs its outcome from Scene One, the major fault of the film which ends on an extremely downbeat note.The highlight of BLACK SWAN is the presentation of the ballet music and all of the behind-the-scenes tension brought on by the determination of ballet maestro VINCENT CASSEL to find a dancer who can be both The White Swan and The Black Swan with equal expertise.He is impressed by NATALIE PORTMAN's skill as The White Swan but tells her she must experience life and love to the utmost in order to provide the proper passion for her darker side as the evil swan. What's hard to believe is that he doesn't spot the flaws in her personality that make her unable to come to grips with the demands of the ballet world. However, his performance is excellent, as is MILA KUNIS as her cunning rival.Portman's mother (BARBARA HERSHEY) seems to be as neurotic as her unstable daughter in a Mommie Dearest sort of way. Their scenes together amp up what we know is bound to be a fatalistic end to an unhappy story. As the rival ballerina, MILA KUNIS provides plenty of jealousy for Portman, already unnerved by the demands that Cassel places on her emoting. Inevitably, Portman is pushed over the edge by all of her hallucinations and insecurities until she falls into a pit of darkness from which there is no escape.Portman's skill as an actress is evident, overcoming any objections some might have to the heavy use of a body double for the difficult ballet moves. She gives her character dimension and pity, despite the unpleasant aspects of the character's irritating personality.Worth a look for the performances alone, but beware that the dark side looms large in just about every scene which some might find too depressing for their taste and the sexual content is close to pornographic at times.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Wow . . . Black Swan is about as perfect as this type of story could be produced,"Wow . . . I mean seriously, wow! I've never been interested in ballet, but I do have a lot of respect for Natalie Portman, so I finally decided to give this a watch.I don't think this entire production could possibly have been done any better, Black Swan is about as perfect as this type of story could be produced. You get pulled into the story as these characters emerge, really feeling like you're there, immersed into their world, and into Nina's (Natalie).The way the camera follows her as she proceeds into the various threads of the story as they unfold, the atmosphere surrounding her, and how it begins to morph from the real into the surreal in gradual but accelerating increments.Many of the other commenters already give detailed descriptions and critiques of the scenes, no need to repeat that here, except to suggest the casting really is spot on for everyone in this.No spoilers here, of course, but even though the viewer might be able to guess how this ends, it doesn't matter, every moment is entirely impactful and engaging.There's no superfluous moments in any of this, beginning to end. Even if you've never seen ballet before, one does come away with a profound understanding of and respect for the vast amount of effort and focus it takes to perform up to that top level.It becomes quite believable that Nina would get obsessed into this pursuit, with her overbearing ballerina mother, living vicariously through her journey into this ultimate level of accomplishment, becoming the Swan Queen.One thing that can be said with certainty, Natalie's work, effort and commitment to perfect her part in this is beyond impressive, any attempt at describing her portrayal of Nina would be an understatement.I very rarely offer a 10 star rating, but without hesitation, that's exactly what comes to mind.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Beautiful, tragic, haunting and nightmarish","I personally do not think this movie the best movie of 2010, I did prefer The King's Speech and The Social Network. But overall, Black Swan is a very, very good film.Albeit one with cracks. While the film succeeds as a character study, with a compelling lead character, there are some occasional logic and originality lapses, not in the script though as the script is very original that still holds the level of intensity in the slower parts, and with exception of Nina and perhaps Lily some of the characters could have done with more depth.Those flaws aside, I loved it. But I can understand why people mayn't like it, I especially have a good friend who found it ham-fisted and found it left a bad taste in her mouth, it is often very adult and graphic with some sexual content. Anyone expecting Swan Lake are better off finding a video production or buying a ticket to somewhere like the Royal Ballet, this is not Swan Lake but a melodramatic and psychological character study revolving around a ballerina and the production of that particular ballet.I remember reading that Darcy Bussell(who I respect) criticised the movie for an inaccurate portrayal of ballerinas or somewhat. I am not saying she is wrong, but I think it depends on the ballerina.Even with any problems the film has, it is beautiful, tragic, haunting and nightmarish not to mention somewhat thought-provoking. The camera work with its contrasting black and whites to create contrasting moods is great, complete with stunning costumes, scenery and sets. The choreography is good and you do feel the sweat that the performers exude when performing, but I would have liked more close-ups of it perhaps.The music is haunting and melancholic and the snippets of the Tchaikovsky ballet that you hear throughout are a delight to hear, but again it could have been more, and the finale is dark and exhilarating. The acting is mostly very good. Vincent Cassel is appropriately slimy, Barbara Hershey is terrific as the controlling mother and Mila Kunis is surprisingly wonderful in her meatiest role yet. But what made Black Swan are Darren Aranofsky's bravura direction and the mesmerising titular performance of Natalie Portman.In conclusion, a very good film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

At the precipice of perfection,"""Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster, and if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.""–– Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good And EvilWe have often heard numerous variations of the phrase, ""It's the journey, not the destination."" Sure, the line has attained a rather trite status, but still manages to maintain relevance. The greatest lessons seem to come from the process of achievement, rather than the achievement itself. In overcoming obstacles, we learn more about ourselves – or at least we should.Black Swan is a film that examines the ""journey"" with an emphasis on the shadowy corners that encompass it. When trekking towards notability, sometimes you must traverse dark passages. This is when the real inquisition takes place. What is the price of perfection? Would you sacrifice relationships? Would you compromise your morality? Would you risk your sanity?While watching Black Swan, it becomes apparent how ballet is the perfect backdrop to explore the theme of well, the pursuit of perfection. For even novice-minded individuals like myself, who have little knowledge of this art form, we quickly realize just how demanding, taxing, and grueling it can be on the mind and body – but all of that is just the superficial lining.Black Swan begins as the classic story of an individual's pursuit of success. It's a story we have seen many times before, this time within the arena of the performing arts. We soon discover this archetypal tale unfolding into something more elaborate though. This is a surreal and mind-bending journey that is anything but standard storytelling fare.Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayers, an outwardly fragile yet inwardly confident ballerina who aspires for the lead role in a production of Swan Lake. The show's director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassell), demands that the Swan Queen be someone who can pull off both the delicate innocence of the White Swan, as well as the seductive nature of the Black Swan. He sees in Nina a precise and talented dancer, but someone who seems to lack the alluring appeal necessary for the darker role. Leroy wants Nina to let go of herself and he takes rather questionable measures to facilitate the process.Standing in Nina's way is Lily (Mila Kunis), a fellow ballerina who has career aspirations of her own. That is where the similarities between the two characters end. Nina's morally bound character starkly contrasts Lily's unbecoming demeanor. Where Nina relies heavily on preciseness during her performances, Lily dances with a natural flair that impresses the director. Nina is drawn to Lily's mysterious persona and the two quickly develop a tense and estranged relationship.Director Darren Aronofsky successfully blends his definitive style with the engaging substance of the script. With Black Swan, his career has clearly realized its fruition. There are obvious remnants of his previous works evident in his latest. Aronofsky effectively depicts the deterioration of the body a la Requiem for a Dream (2000) and The Wrestler (2008). The gradual descent into madness is another phenomenon that he previously examined in Pi (1998) and Requiem.Aronofsky exudes an auteur stature that recalls trademarks of other marquee directors. Like Brian DePalma, he traverses the psychological thriller genre utilizing eroticism and the doubling motif. Like David Cronenberg, he delves into venereal horror and psychosomatic disturbances. And like David Lynch, he reveals a dark underbelly in a typically bright world while blurring reality and illusion.The acting here is top-notch and delivers a genuinely neurotic punch. Portman is stunning and clearly sheds any previous conceptions of modesty and chasteness. Look for her to be the favorite in the Oscar pool for Best Actress. Supporting roles are almost certain to be in the awards mix as well. Kunis is the perfect choice as the sinister adversary. Cassell depicts demand and debauchery with the utmost proficiency. Winona Ryder and Barbara Hershey also shine as a past-her-prime ballerina and an overprotective mother respectively.The cinematography is technically precise and visually stunning. The camera work of Matthew Libatique pulls us into the world of ballet in dramatically up-close fashion. Drawing from The Wrestler, we are thrust into the arena of ballet, almost as if we are dancing along with Nina. The kinetic rush of each spin is intensified with the rotating lens. The illusion of flight is captured with hand held proficiency. We follow Nina's footsteps along her journey as if we are hovering over her shoulder. The motif of mirrors plays a dramatic role throughout the film. The multiple shots and angles, incorporating reflections from mirrors, must have required a tremendous amount of preparation and exactness.There is an underlying sense of captivation in Black Swan. It is a mysterious omnipresence looming almost from the start. Darkness lurks in corners, within corridors, and behind reflections. It reveals itself only periodically at first, a strange rash on the back, and inexplicable bleeding. Even the mundane act of fingernail clipping induces squeamish moments. It leaves us to wonder – like Nina – what we are witnessing. Aronofsky tells his story in Hitchcock-like fashion, injecting suspense in strict moderation. It develops initially as a slow simmer, and is clearly boiling over by the film's climax.The conclusion, though, reminds us of the true essence of Black Swan. Competition can often times be relentless as well as remorseless. Contention can fuel our motivations, test our wills, and catapult us to greater heights. When the mind overcomes the body, we all possess the potential for greatness. Within the journey, we discover something essential about ourselves. The pursuit of perfection, however, can sometimes lead to consequential outcomes. Sometimes, we learn just how far beyond the cusp of morality and sanity we are willing to go. We gaze into the abyss, and it gazes back at us. And sometimes, when we leap beyond the precipice, there is no coming back.",,Anonymous,Drama
"Great performances, average film","Seen as a companion piece to director Darren Aronofsky's critical hit The Wrestler, Black Swan is his love-letter to the operatic world of ballet. Similar to The Wrestler, this is a psychological study of a loyal servant to a chosen profession, who are pushed to the limits both physically and psychologically by the pressures of being good and relevant to their craft. Black Swan throws in a bit of mind-f*****g and horror for good measure too.Nina (Natalie Portman) is a gifted dancer who is reaching the make-or- break stage in her career. Always being pushed and encouraged by her mollycoddling mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), she hears about a new production of the Swan Lake to be directed by Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), which requires one actress to play a dual role of both the White Swan and the Black Swan. Nina is an ideal choice for the role of the virginal, elegant White Swan, but Leroy has doubts over her ability to let go and become the darker, seductive Black Swan, a role that would be ideal for newcomer Lily (Mila Kunis). After a talk in Leroy's office, Nina reacts badly to Leroy's advance and he becomes exhilarated when he catches a brief glimpse of what she could be capable of. And, when the casting is announced, Nina is awestruck when she lands the lead role.The second act sees Nina engage on a mission to become the Black Swan, and this is when things get stranger. Doppelganger's, reflections that seem to have a mind of their own, and a dabble in lesbianism start to push Nina towards psychological breaking point. It is unfortunately at this point where the film begins a steady decline, after the highly promising first hour or so. The twists and turns of Nina's ever- declining mental state feature various strange episodes that I felt very familiar with. It had the same predictability as other films focusing on similar issues (Jacob's Ladder, The Machinist) and things rarely come as a surprise. Of course this is a film about the theatrical dramatics of ballet, but it begins to get overwrought and camp, when I feel it would have worked better with the style of the tense, slower-paced first act.Not to knock the film too much, there is still much to enjoy here. The performances are excellent, namely Portman. She is in practically every scene and is every bit as good as you've most likely heard. Her transformation from the sweet, dedicated Nina of the first half to the desperate, troubled one of the second is wholly convincing, and that is down to Portman's acting ability. The scene in the cubicle when she calls her mother to tell her she got the part perfectly captures Nina's joy mixed with utter disbelief and confusion. She's always been a very good actress, but apart from 2004's Closer, she's never really been given a role she can really chew on. Here she chews with aplomb. Like I stated in a previous post, I would not begrudge her the Oscar if she beats my hopeful Jennifer Lawrence for Winter's Bone.Black Swan is a very well-made film with amazing scenes of ballet, powerful acting and loose, confrontational camera-work, similar to that of The Wrestler. I just wish Aronofsky had been a bit more original with the horror scenes and offered something genuinely tormenting, similar to what he did with Requiem For A Dream. Probably not for ballet-buffs either, unless you also enjoy scenes of fingernail removal and masturbation.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
The beauty and darkness mirror that of Odette and Odile.,"Ballerina Nina lands the role of Snow Queen in a production of Swan Lake, she embraces the role of white swan Odette, but struggles with the part of black swan Odile. Pushed hard by her director and mother she starts to lose her grip on reality.Black Swan is a movie everyone should see, it may not be to everyone's taste in terms of storyline, but the cinematography and acting make it a must watch movie.Who would have thought the subject of ballet could make for such a hot topic, but there you have it. The ballet is a hot bed for jealousy, hatred disturbing rivalry, and it's those elements that bring this film to life. I personally love the subject, I love the originality of the story.At times this film is hard to watch, it's a mix of glorious and brutal, there are moments of sophisticated grace and elegance, contrasted with some genuinely disturbing moments.If ever anyone earned an Oscar through hard work, it was Natalie Portman, she didn't simply turn up and speak the lines, you can see the work she put it, she must have trained so hard for this part, she deserved her win, it's a captivating performance.Mila Kunis and Vincent Cassel are terrific in their supporting roles, the whole cast perform so well.Epic.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Overrated... nothing special, overhyped.","Unfortunately, I was not impressed by the film. It was two hours of build up to an ending that simply didn't awe. And even the build up really didn't make that much sense.Natalie Portman does a great job acting the white swan part. She's frail, insecure and completely dependent on her mother, who still acts as if Natalie is 5 years old. When she transforms into the black swan at the end, however, there really isn't much transformation. Let's see-she has a lesbian fantasy after being drugged and kisses Vincent Cassel. Aside from that, she really still acts frail and insecure right through to the end of the film. Her transformation is more obvious in the special effects, which aren't the best.Despite the film being about a dancer, there is no impressive dancing in the film. Even the end dance is shot with way too many cuts and hand held cameras resulting in a finale that simply underwhelms.#zevendesignreview.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Overrated but good nonetheless,"This movie can be rated anything between 4-10, depending on what the viewer expects from it or how its interpreted. The movie is quite disturbing in some places, but it doesn't just shock the audiences for the sake of it, but for the story; how obsession towards perfection can at worst affect ones decisions, psyche, relationships and bring about total loss of identity for the sake of art. The transformation of the main protagonist is quite well done, one of the strongest roles of Natalie Portman for sure.When it comes down to rating this personally, I'm not entirely sure what to give this... Its hard to pinpoint the things that I didn't like about the movie but if there was anything, it'd be a slight lack of care for the main character at times because it felt like I wasn't sure where she comes from, why is she so driven towards perfection, what motivates her. Rest of the flaws are quite minimal, but overall the entertainment value at times wasn't quite there, the music often was too aggressive as well trying too hard to provoke certain emotions, but nonetheless its a movie I'd recommend to almost anyone to watch at least once.Great acting all around with some nice twists spread throughout.The ending though felt a tad stretched out as I was getting bored, but of course it has a lot to do with my disinterest towards ballet-dancing admittedlyOverall:

Practice Makes Perfectly Insane.,"A bizarre, beautiful & bewildering study of madness, and a thrilling piece of aesthetic filmmaking that ingeniously blends beauty with horror, Black Swan is a harrowing depiction of a passion turning into an obsession that ultimately leads to total self-destruction. Crafted with meticulous care & precision, and elevated to another level by Natalie Portman's mystifying performance, this psychosexual thriller presents Aronofsky in prime form, and is arguably his most mature work to date.",,Anonymous,Drama
The Brilliance of Black Swan,"Many films, like the Oscar-nominee ""The King's Speech,"" portray its main character (in this case King George) as he goes about his daily routine, fly-on-the-wall-style. The director steps away and lets the story and the actors speak for themselves. But sometimes the best films are the ones where we are thrust inside the protagonist's mind by having the director use the art of cinema to depict the world in a new and different way.One of the best examples of this type of film is ""Black Swan,"" the magnum opus of director Darren Aronofsky. The film is a musing on art, perfection and beauty as told through the unstable eyes of Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), a young, talented ballet dancer. From the opening shot of a dreamlike Sayers dancing the lead in ""Swan Lake,"" to the last few minutes, every shot is through Nina's perception. This isn't a portrait- it's a headfirst dive into her psyche. We all know someone like Sayers' character—too much of a perfectionist for her own good. She spends her days practicing, obsessing over her every move and eating next to nothing. After rehearsals, she returns home to her sparse and windowless apartment also inhabited by her overbearing mother (Barbara Hershey) who had to give up her own dreams of stardom when she became pregnant. She cares for her daughter deeply, but has coddled and stifled her so much that Nina is still emotionally a child, as evidenced by the huge stuffed animals crowding her all-pink-and-white room. Nina dances in a company run by egotistical and smarmy director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) who is casting the lead for a reinvented version of ""Swan Lake."" Nina is the obvious choice for the Swan Queen: beautiful, fragile and utterly virginal. But the problem, he explains, is that the lead must also play the Black Swan, the Queen's evil twin. Seemingly perfect for that role is Lily (Mila Kunis), a San Francisco transplant who is seductive, sensual and dances with almost unrestrained fluidity. But the part ends up in Nina's hands and she struggles to shed her good-girl image in order to inhabit the sexy black swan. Thomas keeps telling her to ""lose herself"" in the role. And she does, but maybe a bit too much. First it's mysterious scratches, then disturbing visions, and soon Nina starts to descend into a very dark place. Adding to her stress is Lily, who appears to try to sabotage Nina in order to take her role. The more that's revealed here the less fun you'll have watching it, but the whole third act is a beautiful and nail-biting climax that is nothing short of pure theatrical brilliance. While Portman's fearless performance has been critically praised, and she is a shoe-in for the ""Best Actress"" Oscar, all the performances are uniformly top-notch. Kunis walks the fine line between sweet and naughty, radiating the screen every time she comes on. Hershey, whose snub by the Oscars is truly criminal, gives a wonderfully complex performance in a role that could have easily been one-note. The real star of the film is its direction by Darren Aronofsky. He pulls together the formalistic style of ""Requiem for a Dream,"" the warped-reality of ""Pi"" and the stark realism of ""The Wrestler"" into one coherent and masterful film. He fills every moment with meaningful art direction and symbolism. Notice the mysterious and skin-crawling sound effects and the ever-present swan and mirror motif. A brief mention must also be given to Clint Mansell, whose largely orchestral score gives the film a lush, theatrical and unsettling atmosphere. Aronofsky's biggest achievement is using the camera to get inside Nina's head. The puzzle that this film becomes has no answers because the film is told by an unreliable narrator. It is truly a key component to this film and makes it dangerous and exhilarating. While a thriller about ballet doesn't even seem logical, Aronofsky has turned it into a stylish, psycho-sexual suspense film that is far and away one of the most ambitious and mesmerizing films of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Brutal, compelling and engaging. One of my favorite movies of all time!","The more I watch this movie, the more I feel all the sensations I felt the first time stronger and stronger. A modern classic, directed by Daren Aronofsky (""Requiem: For a Dream"" and ""Mother!"", two other masterpieces), touches the protagonist's mind and ours as well.The direction is impeccable, visceral and overwhelming. Introduce, in everything that must be presented, paper presentation, transformation and the absolute surrender of Nina, in addition to her obsession with paper. The soundtrack is frightening, being used from the original piece, with a sound but sonorous in the best moments, it was scary.All the characters are well-written, each with their own madness and inner goals, and acting in complete sync with everything else. But Natalie Portman, the protagonist, is a standout! Going through all the metamorphosis of her character, well deserved or Oscar for best actress for this role.Simply a work of art! Checking what the price for perfection is. Walking in the genres of suspense, drama, psychological horror and with the musical theme, you fear, feelings of distress, delirium, doubt, knowledge, curiosity. It's epic!

I Cannot Praise This Film Enough!,"'Black Swan' is honestly a phenomenal film! I highly recommend seeing it as soon as you can.The themes within this are outstanding! You get explorations of gender, innocence, sexuality, and some more. I love how they interweave the 'Black Swan' story into the film's actual narrative. It creates a memorising hyperreality, as you question every action on screen. The classical ballet further emphasises the many thematic ideas the film is representing.Natalie Portman is beyond fantastic as the main protagonist. It must be one of the best performances of her career, as she captures a rather innocent young woman who is struggling to embody the 'Black Swan' ballet character. Also, Mila Kunis and Vincent Cassel were great in the supporting cast.I cannot praise this film enough and it is a must see for any film lover.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Swan lake or a swan dive?,"Just what i need , another film that is confusing and is difficult to understand. We had it with Inception last year and in previous films like The Fountain , The Matrix and Fight club. Call me old fashioned but i like to understand what I'm watching. The best way i can describe this is that is a modern take on the Ballet , Swan Lake. Swan lake within a Swan Lake. It involves a girl who has to somehow transform her whiter than white style of dancing in such a way that she can perform as the Black Swan. While this transformation happens , she mentally breaks down. I've seen this described as a Psychological thriller and if you read that too you might be a bid disappointed with the outcome.

The ugly signet goes on her journey...,"I'm not normally keen on melodramas, and this was definitely one of those... but, to be fair, the ending tied together the more over-the-top moments pretty well.Ultimately I enjoyed it, but I definitely wouldn't herald it as some kind of masterful psychological drama. The big scenes spin too frequently into hysteria to be effectively chilling, for me. It's hardly subtle, but it does work well if high-camp and grandiosity is what you're after.What it does do is confirm that Aronofsky is always willing to take risks and do interesting things with the projects he chooses to make. Like the film itself, he's never dull, but he's not always classy, either. At least he can't be easily pigeonholed (beyond his consistent work in the independent sector, that is)",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
There is a thin line between perfectionism and insanity,"Darren Aronofsky immerses the viewer in the world of the dancer, where performance anxiety is routine and one is always looking over one's shoulder. Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman in a mesmerizing and Oscar-worthy performance) is a fragile ballerina coddled by an overprotective and infantilizing mother. Her perfectionism attracts the attention of ballet director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel in a brilliantly creepy performance), who on the one hand encourages her poise and controlled form for the role of the White Swan but on the other hand, finds difficulty cultivating the looser, more seductive form required for the role of the Black Swan. He believes that he can coax this performance out of her, and Nina pushes herself to meet this expectation. She endures the director's rebukes, her mother's suffocating attention (and career-associated guilt trips), the knowledge of what happened to the company's former star ballerina, and the arrival of her rebellious understudy, Lily (played surprisingly well by Mila Kunis). Despite all of these obstacles, as Leroy tells her later, ""the only thing standing in your way is you."" Aronofsky distills themes from ""All About Eve,"" ""The Red Shoes,"" ""The Wrestler"" (his companion piece with similar themes from 2008), and of course the Swan Lake ballet itself, with imagery inspired by early Polanski (i.e. ""Repulsion,"" ""The Tenant"") and Cronenberg (i.e. ""Videodrome""), as well as deft use of black, white, and red color and moody chiaroscuro. While it is not quite as disturbing as ""Requiem for a Dream"" (few things are), it is just as visceral and engaging and is probably Aronofsky's best film.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Portman and Aronofsky achieve the difficult combination of darkness and beauty,"Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" will leave a myriad of lasting impressions on different people for different reasons, but universally, the film will prove to the masses that ballet is most definitely not boring. Beautiful, thrilling, breathtaking -- yes, I'm referring to both the art form and the film. ""Black Swan"" echoes everything there is to love about both art forms: the passion, the elegance, the drive to create something deep and moving. Aronofsky's film is every bit as graceful as the art form and culture it seeks to capture, but more noticeably, every bit as challenging and dark and uncomfortable.Although Aronofsky's name has the reputation attached because of his visceral, deeply emotional and borderline distressful filmmaking style (""The Wrestler,"" ""Requiem for a Dream""), the spotlight belongs on star Natalie Portman as the film's first image so appropriately conveys. ""Black Swan"" is her story, a partial allegory for the ballet she's working on (""Swan Lake""), but more so a piercing journey into the mind of a sheltered and innocent young woman whose quest for perfection plunges her into a psychologically state that she cannot comprehend.Portman plays Nina Sayers, a ballerina in New York's finest company whose dedication to her craft is never compromised (need I point out her name rhymes with ballerina?). Her success is partly thanks to her mother (Barbara Hershey), whom she still lives with and who literally mothers her to a ridiculous extent, but has kept her focused and out of trouble. Hershey plays the part carefully, not lapsing into clichéd overprotective mother territory too much, with a bit of help from the script not overdoing it as well.Nina's dedication and innocence have finally appealed to her instructor/the company's artistic director, Thomas (Vincent Cassel), who casts her as the coveted role of Swan Queen, which combines both parts of White Swan and Black Swan to make an artistic point about duality (and the film more interesting). Thomas tells Nina she's the quintessential White Swan, the innocent, picturesque dancer, but that she possesses no qualities of the seductive and fluid Black Swan. He believes in her, however, and is attracted (somewhat inappropriately) to her, so while he's given her the part, she still has to ""earn"" it.Nina's quest to become the Black Swan, to divorce herself from the sheltered lifestyle that has wound her so tightly so she can convincingly do the Black Swan dance, is the center of the drama. This is accompanied by a mysterious ""transformation"" she appears to be undergoing into an actual swan along with times when she's on the subway or other places and she sees herself. The suspenseful elements grow from subtle tension to full-blown horror as the film goes on and the pressure mounts for Nina to succeed. At times the ""scares"" feel extreme, but the horror complements the poise and elegance of the ballet nicely. In fact the two work harmoniously at times, especially thanks to Clint Mansell's Tchaikovsky-twisting score.Seeing as Aronofsky enjoys seizing the opportunity to make his audience uncomfortable, the horror should come as no surprise and neither should the pervasive sexuality of the film. Nina must learn to feel not think, to be seductive in her movement, and so the sexual ties to that are inherent (and arguably forced in at times). When Mila Kunis enters the picture as Lily, a fellow dancer who embodies the Black Swan characteristics Nina so desperately wants (she does drugs, sleeps around, eats cheeseburgers), a thick layer of sexuality drops onto the story. Overall, there's quite a bit of female sexuality, which despite how far movies have come, still has a taboo on it more so than male sexuality, so it does distract from its point at time. By and large, however, Aronofsky keeps these scenes pertinent and meaningful.In the perspective of the entire film, however, sexual tension marks just one of numerous tensions that Aronofsky constantly weaves under the plot. Every scene has layers of text and subtext to make the scenes that don't have a fantastical element to them equally gripping. Aronofsky and Portman are the real dance partners here, working together to make what's beneath the surface an equal player in the viewing experience as well as to reflect -- quite literally with all the mirrors -- the levels of turmoil in Nina's mind.Portman's performance ranks heads and tails above all her previous work. The overprotected child who is rigid and naive could be seen as an archetype, but Portman convinces us of Nina's reality by taking all these attributes to her core. Her emotions, like her in-tears excitement over getting the part of Swan Queen when she calls to tell her mom, are so convincing. We identify with her mixed feeling of excitement, fear and doubt among others and her performance communicates all those emotions stewing together inside her. Considering that ""Black Swan"" seriously features her performance if not hinges on it, her success cannot be overstated.Nina's pursuit of perfection, to embody both sides of the coin instead of being the best at one side, will relate to everyone who has ever dared to be really good at anything challenging. The circumstances and results of Nina's particular story are stretched for dramatic effect, but Portman's performance remains so convincing throughout and Aronofsky's direction every bit as masterfully artistic that ""Black Swan"" deserves some of the highest of the praise that will go around in 2010. The film achieves the rare poetic synergy between the music, ballet, acting and direction that leaves you thinking a lot about what you just saw.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Good vs Evil,"A psychological thriller about a ballet dancer's battle with innocence, the end of guarding that innocence, and rival competition. The director encompasses this three-dimensional trait into one gifted, beautifully poised lady named Nina, played by Natalie Portman, whose solo life is domiciled with her smothering and controlling mother Erica, played by Barbara Hershey. They shared one thing in common, ballet. This tradition from mother to child persist without resistance. Nina soar above her mother's failed career. One shocking look into Erica's grimy face, said washout, disappointment and collapse in ones hope for success. Unfortunately dance wasn't the only continuity, so was schizophrenia. Her inner world was suppressed with demons and dark impulses, a cruse Nina learned to live with but never shared. Her strive toward perfection in her ballet and her diet, clearly steered her toward anorexia. For the sake of the movie title, The director, Darren Aronofsky, chose not to place the spotlight on Nina's beautiful swan like movements but, on Nina's downward spiral descent into deep psychosis.The white swan is exquisite, sweet, and pure and the black swan dark, mystical, and bewitching. In order to be the Swan Queen, Natalie Portman had to be all of these characters. The artistic dance director, Thomas, played by Vincent Cassel, knows Nina is the white swan and must push her to become the black swan. In order to accomplish this, Thomas suggests she forget about being perfect. Perfection is not about control, you must try to surprise yourself and the audience. This order undoubtedly forces her to unlock the trapped demons into her world, an experience she has so, so dreaded.The Director's target to give birth to the evil swan was right on point. Natalie skillful acting abilities switching from good to bad-- friendly to hostile and from naive to worldly was just incredible. She laid her emotions out there, haunting us with spontaneous hallucination and phantom sensations. Our vision became blurry with her vision. We could no longer discriminate between real and imagined experiences. This unique concept, To see what a schizophrenic sees, gave insight to her unintentional altered perception. The evil twin, the evil force was pulling her, pulling me.The music was simply magnificent and speaks for itself, Tchaikovsky's 'The Swan'. The music score enhanced by Clint Mansell, uses the dark tones to keep us in tune with the delusions surrounding her virtual reality of violence. It works extraordinarily well throughout the entire movie. As with many others, Tchaikovsky's music has been part of my memory since attending the symphony during grade school, listening to CDs, and movie scores past and present. The whole musical affair is clearly meant to separate good and evil and believe me it struck the right note.Black Swan is intriguing and captivating. I promise, you will not be disappointed, perhaps a little confused. Hopefully, it will arouse your curiosity to listen to its music or see a real ballet performance or perhaps watch 'The Turning Point' where real ballet dancers such as Mikhail Baryshnikov and Leslie Browne perform effortlessly. If it does that, and not focus on weight loss or self-destruction, then we all win and can say, ""It was perfect.""",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Painful. Visually raw an entertaining psychological thrilling drama. It's very wicked and sexy it proves a profession sacrifices the body and soul.,"I must say ""Black Swan"" is visually stunning in a crazy and raw kind of way, and in the meantime it leaves your heart bleeding with sorrow and pain. One thing is for sure and it's true that many of us can relate to and that is in a profession or line of work it's tough and most of all as this film proves it's a sacrifice to one's body and soul especially if one's going for perfection and clearly the lead character here Nina is trying her best. Director Darren Aronofsky(""The Wrestler"") is one who's known to go over the top as many of his films show the pain and dark side of life and clearly with this mind guessing thriller drama ""Black Swan"" Darren clearly pushed the envelopes to the edges as after viewing you will feel exhausted with satisfaction. Yet despite the accomplishment your heart will feel the pain and sorrow that came from the dark transformations and mind changes that little Nina went thru to obtain grace and face her demons.Set in New York city young Nina Sayers(done brilliant and emotionally raw by the beautiful Natlie Portman)is a hard working and up and coming ballet dancer. Nina is working her butt off to impress as she has to stay busy training when she receives constant stress and high expectation thoughts of success from her lonely ex ballet dancing mother Erica(Barbara Hershey). Then a window of opportunity opens up as in the cutthroat business of dance a former lead dancer Beth(Winona Ryder)is let go. Now it's Nina's turn for the lead role in the production of ""Swan Lake"". Nina is ideal for the role of the white swan, yet from the get go she feels dogged and stressed by the great deal of pressure that's put upon her by her coach and instructor Thomas Leroy(Vincent Cassel). It's almost like Nina feels like a black swan already.To complicate matters in what is really the most wicked and psychologically engaging and highly entertaining parts of the film is the work of Lily(Mila Kunis in such a raw erotic wicked performance) who is Nina's rival dance performer and Lily's the ideal part for the Black Swan. Only a tricky and cruel plan is in the works Lily will take Nina on a mind numbing wind journey of total transformation in my opinion and this will put Nina more in the form of an actual Black Swan! The performance from Mila was so great as her character Lily who's such a free spirit really rocks the boat as having Nina to come out of her shell and engage in hot lesbian love making just makes for some sweet eye candy especially seeing Kunis in a sexy black bra. Aside from that Nina feels overthrown with pressures from all three as the expectations of Thomas, Erica, and Lily's wicked cutthroat cat and mouse games have Nina on the edge of a mental and nervous breakdown. Interesting seeing how she's even resorted to masturbation to prepare for her lead role as the Swan. As many scenes are visually explicit not just the peeled skin, bumps, bruises, and blood scars but clearly you see in Nina's eyes she's like a possessed woman both mentally and physically as she's grown into the Black Swan literally.Overall ""Black Swan"" is a film that proves to aim for perfection it's a sacrifice with many struggles both mentally and physically. And even though Aronofsky showed that the goal can be obtained in the end as Nina did, still it comes with great sacrifice and sorrow as really Darren went over the top as his outcome and message will disturb many as clearly Aronofsky proves life can be dark even in the world of dance. Still aside from the sorrow and pain the film brings it's well blended with determination and will power that obtains satisfaction and highly enjoyable seeing one explore some of their wicked ways like Nina did as it's a little fun being wicked and sexy. The performances were top notch from both Portman and Kunis you could really see these two actresses were really inside their roles in fact it was reported that Portman said she felt she was even gonna die in real life on set while doing this role. ""Black Swan"" is well done even though hard to enjoy it shows that life is tough, and that sacrificing in a profession can be wicked, raw, and emotionally disturbing especially when perfection is obtained while the body and mind goes thru a psychological transformation.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""Black Swan"" is a dark and dramatic near perfect masterpiece from director Darren Aronofsky.","""Black Swan"" tells the story of a dedicated ballerina named Nina (played by Natalie Portman) who life revolves around her becoming New York City's number one ballet dancer. Obsessed with being the best, Nina is offered the lead role in Thomas Leroy's (Vincent Cassel) version of Swan Lake. This role is set to be one of the hardest for Nina as she has to play two roles within one character. The White Swan, which, requires innocence and grace has been mastered by Nina. The Black Swan, however, is the role that is giving her grief. You see the Black Swan is nothing like Nina and so begins her struggle to obtain greatness by learning how to enter into this darker character. It's only a matter of time before Lily (Mila Kunis) arrives who proves she has what it takes to play the infamous Black Swan. Its now up to Nina to learn from Lily how to unleash her dark side within the role or forever live life as a failure in the ballet world.What the hell was that? Was all I could say when the credits began to roll at the end of ""Black Swan."" One thing I knew for sure was that it was a dark and brilliant piece of cinema. Sure, I was uncertain by what I just witnessed on screen for the past two hours but that was sort of the point. This movie was made to leave its audience feeling uneasy and it does it well. This movie ends on a note that lets you know the movie is over and doesn't leave the audience hanging. The film however, leaves you wanting to discuss it right away once it ends.""Black Swan"" is a dark and psychological piece of cinema and truly makes you think throughout the entire film. While the subject matter of ballet may not intrigue many, it's how the film plays out that truly makes it worth wild. Its a dark and deep piece of cinema, filled with a few chills and thrills along the way. You will definitively leave the theater with plenty to say after viewing the film. You will probably begin to argue with others about what exactly the outcome of the film was as it was very open to interpretation.Natalie Portman is absolutely terrific in this film. I am so used to her playing characters, where she is so independent and strong willed. As Nina, Portman plays a scared character who is afraid to reach outside her comfort zone. She is straight laced and as innocent as they come. She is obsessed and truly dedicated with all things dance. This is a truly haunting performance by Portman, one that deserves an award..Portman's character is not likable in the film as she is a very dark and unlikable character. Her personality is obsolete in most of the film. This is one of those roles that truly show off a good actress from a bad one. Portman pulled it off with such ease. As for the other supporting roles, they were great as well. Kunis in particular played a role unlike anything she has played before. A wild sex cat so to speak with ties to all things seedy. She was perfect for the role and truly offset the timid and innocent character that Nina was. Vincent Cassel, was perfect as the hard ass ballet teacher who truly used and abused his students. He was truly incredible. Winona Ryder was great as well in her minor role. She was a very dark character as well who truly showed how living a life as the ""Black Swan"" was a truly horrific lifestyle to live. She was surprisingly raw and real in this film.I haven't seen much of Darren Aronofsky work and I know as a film lover and critic that is a shame on my behalf. I have had ""The Wrestler"" on Blu Ray since the day it was released but never watched it. I have however, watched his other critically acclaimed film, ""Requiem for a Dream"" which is a dark and depressing piece of cinema. That movie WILL make you depressed if you have not seen it. Its a story of life and the battles people go through. Its not a happy film but a well crafted cinematic masterpiece. With that being said, ""Black Swan"" is probably Aronofsky's new masterpiece. Its well shot, it's interesting, its dark, its haunting, it's deep, its creepy, and most importantly it makes you think. Its a film that isn't confusing but rather challenges you (the audience member) to come up with your own conclusion. You will hear a lot about this film in the next few months and I am sure most of it will be positive. Aronofsky is a brilliant filmmaker and that goes without saying. His vision as a filmmaker is truly one of the kind even if he is too humble to ever admit that.When Oscar season rolls around come January, you will be certain to see ""Black Swan"" up there with ""Social Network"" as one of the most critically acclaimed films of the year. It will be nominated in several categories including Best Picture, Director, and Best Actress. Portman shines in the film and delivers a haunting and one of a kind performance. Aronofsky makes a film that truly leaves an audience talking and wanting more when it ends. It is a near perfect masterpiece hands down and may not be for everyone but lovers of film will truly appreciate the brilliant piece of film making ""Black Swan"" is.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Black Swan"" is a solid 9 out of 10. One of the darkest and well acted films of the year!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Way to End the Year,"First of all casting was amazing. Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, and Vincent Cassel all fit together so well on screen. It was interesting to watch from the very beginning with the beautifully choreographed and directed intro. I was in awe throughout the whole film. Portmanm delivered in the role of Nina as well as her counterpart Kunis (Lily).The storyline was well conveyed, and ultimately it never failed to ENTERTAIN. The battle of Good and Evil within a character never gets old if executed correctly and Aronofsky did an amazing job as well as the writer Mark Heyman. This is a movie worth seeing. It had many elements that surprised me in a drama film, which is never a bad thing.Regardless of the sexual content, I loved watching Nina(Portman)transform and embody the Black Swan. The Ending was magnificent. I praise Darren Aronofsky and recommend anyone reading this to watch it. (:",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Portman prevents Swan from diving,"Darren Aronofsky's signature hallucinogenic style dealing with the individual in crisis is well in evidence in this take on a prima ballerina going bonkers in pursuit of perfection. But there's more frosting than substance and Black Swan lurches from Polanski to Halloween franchise in order to make its case.Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is the hardest working hoofer in the ballet company over at Lincoln Center. A technical marvel she lacks the killer instinct to play the heavy but is never the less chosen to take on the dual role of the white and black swan in the Tchaikovsky ballet. In rehearsal white is going well, black isn't. Her autocratic and always horny director tries to get her to ""loosen up"" with him or a Frisco company import, Lily who also is understudying her. Feeling the pressure (including that of a suffocating mother) Nina begins to descend into a paranoid abyss as the big dance approaches.Aronofsky usually deals with a heavy hand, balancing it with bravura camera work that climbs inside his troubled leads (Ellen Burstyn in Invitation to a Dream, Mickey Rourke in the Wrestler), forcing the audience to see the world through their eyes with ample amounts of subjective angles. He gets the same results here with Ms. Portman whose serene physical beauty is undermined by her struggle with a polarizing combination of innocence and ambition. But visually Swan flounders as the director with an embarrassment of possibilities to go Gothic horror zaps the films rhythm with repetitive and unnecessary supporting character re- enforcement. Andrew Libatiques camera work is a bit sloppy and erratic as he chases Nina around the stage duplicating dance moves without really achieving full extension. His resting compositions are at times shapeless and unfocused and while it may be arguable to say it does so to reflect Nina's emotional state its rumpled look extends beyond her character.The Black Swan tips its hand early but overall it is a decent suspense/horror film about the destructive nature of striving for perfection; something that Portman's performance flirts with from start to finish.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Masterful acting, yet a bland and predictable plot","Change the drug addiction in ""A requiem for a dream"" with a dancer's obsession for perfection and the wreaked mentality of a young person, being put under tremendous pressure, and you've got the plot for ""Black Swan"".Don't get me wrong - the acting is indeed a masterpiece, Natalie Portman is incredibly convincing, so are the rest of the cast, who portray the older teacher trying to seduce his pupil, the obsessive has-been mother and the rival, determined to get the part. The ballet scenes are masterfully directed and depicted with true passion.However that didn't keep me from asking myself (after having watched the first hour of the movie) -""When is this going to end""?. The first time I saw the tearful Nina crumbling under the stress of her or her moms obsession, I could already sense where the movie was leading the viewer and what it was trying to say - an innocent and very inexperienced young girl is thrust into a world of competition, absurd physical requirements (read anorexia), unclear personal motivation, talks behind one's back and of course the obligatory overexposed sexuality.Not even once did I feel so enthralled by the plot in order to believe the portrayed images and delusions. The ""Fight club""-style plot twist was obvious from the start of the movie and could only manage an underwhelming climax.In my opinion the movie as a whole is not worthy of an Oscar Nomination. But if it is pretentiousness and fairly obvious conclusions of the ""Crime doesn't pay"", ""Drugs destroy life"" and ""Obsessions will swallow you whole"" type Hollywood is looking for - than by all means, two thumbs up for art for the sake of art.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Dancing Queen,"Requiem For a Dream may be what he's known for, but this is truly Aronofsky's masterpiece. Black Swan is a crown jewel of film. As a thriller, it's chilling to the bone. The concepts of perfection, societal pressure, competition, lust and power are examined by Aronofsky through the art of the ballet. Natalie Portman is eaten alive by this role. It's unbelievable to watch. The last 30 minutes is an uninterrupted stroke of genius that blends fantasy and reality, in what I could only assume is what a pure psychotic break looks and feels like.

My 370th Review: More Awful Than Excellent: The Explicit Exploration Of The Subconscious Is Not A Winner,"Since the Ballet Russe and Dhiagiliev ballet has been explored on film. But not often. This is a waste, given that Merce Cuningham and The American Ballet changed the dynamic of dance and that film and ballet are both moving arts. Ballet has been explored in films like White Nights with Baryshnikov and All That Jazz, but has only been captured once truly successfully in Powell and Pressburger's stunning The Red Shoes (Which is one of THE films - whether you like ballet or not).So we were looking forward, especially after the positive reviews, to seeing Black Swan. I considered The Wrestler to be very very good indeed and while I get that they are companion pieces I did not find Black Swan to be the same rich experience.This is not the fault of Natalie Portman or an excellent cast who do give it their all.Perhaps Aaronovsky in trying to pull the same trick twice shows too much smoke and mirrors here - and by this I mean, the film's constant desire to explicitly state the tortured side through images, which the Wrestler never does. It is effective sure, but it lacks the aesthetic to bring the dark side of the dance life to more than a reduction - and what we get IS a sledgehammer to crack an egg. I have nothing about the scenes per se (and they have been discussed so much in the papers I don't need to any spoilers here) but in this reviewer's opinion they do seem a cop out for the really hard process of conveying what they convey without this chicanery.The better question is does the film lose by removing them? - In this reviewer's opinion, in all but the final 20 minutes - no, not a jot - which means they are at best a device and at worse a distraction. There is enough emotional impact in the relationships to drive the character to her final place, and the other scenes do not lend weight they simply overburden the film.The film is at its best in the dance scenes - and I don't just say that simply as someone who loves ballet - it simply is. The back stories, mother, NY bars etc; somehow don't give the weight to the creation of Natalie Portman's character in anyway the same that the dance rehearsals do, or say, the simple act of children chasing Mickey Rourke in the Wrestler did.I sense here a missed opportunity - yes, it is one of the great films about dance, but there are not that many to compare it to. Black Swan tries to imagine the complex world of pain, agony, and happiness that dancers inhabit, but in doing so it resorts to several devices that though uncomfortable are not more than effective.It is worth seeing, but I for one, and this won't be the popular opinion, cannot rave about it.All in all I was left strangely unmoved and distanced by the subplots and would wish that it had focused harder on the dance process. It is not an easy to watch, and I would not want that for one moment, but by making the internal so external it fails to achieve the pinnacle.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A director's triumph, quintessential cinema, mainstream horror, genius writing","Black Swan is a very original film, a fresh in the air film. Yes, there is another movie with similar themes which is Red Shoes, but other than that movie in the history of cinema, I think that Black Swan is an unique film and experience. I haven't seen such a different, genius dance scenes before in my life! It is pure cinema. The camera movements and lighting are genius thanks to Darren Aranofsky, also he creates a chilling and suspenseful atmosphere in a brilliant way. The movie is technically and visually mesmerizing, for example the ballet shoes making scene captured me. The movie is pure art, but also a great psychological thriller. The script is highly smart, it is full of metaphors and clues about the content and the lives of the characters. I think the movie's main themes are the desire of being perfect and career ambition. The mother character reminds me Haneke's The Piano Teacher, in my opinion two mothers share some very similar characteristics, but the mother here is mysterious (the other was not) Portman's acting is incredible, one of the best female performances of all time may be, Mila Kunis was also a great choice for the character and as a performance she was top-notch! Also, Winona Ryder who I don't particularly like as an actress was great in this. I couldn't solve the mystery of body scratches by the way. The lesbian scene wasn't a box office tool if you ask my opinion, its necessity is open to question, but it adds some very important aspects to the story. Also, ""was I good?"" line was a clear The Family Guy wit that leaves a smile on your face. As a content, I couldn't the mystery of that lesbian scene either. There is also a climactic dance sequence and everything from editing to art direction, from sounds to meanings and metaphors, it was a brilliant experience. And after a second thought, the ending was perfect and twisted a little (an early question from another ballet dancer made us think differently about what is going on) Black Swan is one of the masterpieces of this century. It is also like the film combines mainstream suspense cinema with independent art cinema perfectly. It should have won the best film Oscar.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One hell of a movie,"Darren Arnofsky has gone through a change of taste in filmmaking within the past 10 years and after the first decade of the 21st century he topped it off with one of his best. Black Swan is a fascinating story that brings snippets of different aspects from all his movies combined with the very profound story of a belle dancer which creates this very beautiful film. The blacks,whites, and subtle pinks in the set design bring such a unique feeling that most movies are not doing now a days. Portman and Kunis's roles were articulated perfectly to the very last bit of dialouge. But the things that really made me give this movie a 8 rather than a 10 is the music and some of the special effects were a bit of a let down for me. The epic Lux Aterna from Requiem to the sorrow filled compositions of the fountain to this was no comparison. The Wrestlers music had done the same to me as Black Swan too.Anyone who is a Arnofsky fan should go see it though no matter what. Its in the top 10 best movies of the year in my book. Hope this helps.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Tragic Masterpiece,"Film Review: Black SwanDarren Aronofsky's Black Swan strikes you as a well narrated tragic masterpiece where the protagonist's flaw in character is her child-like innocence. The drama narrates the strange vicissitudes of the life of a young ballerina as she sheds the raiment of mollitude and adorns the evil prowess of a femme-fatale. In a broader sense it is a story of art consuming the artist.The dream like movement of the plot is well threaded with the wonderful choreography, and Natalie Portman comes out as a sensational queen of both drama and dance. She is perfect; her face a pool of emotions, each sentiment is penciled into her features with deft mastery.For years the pious Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) has served her term in a New York ballet company mastering her techniques and generally polishing her act, but what she lacks is the acting prowess. The company having suffered an alteration of fate, the director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) decides to rejuvenate the under the weather corporation by recasting the classical Swan Lake. He selects the naïve Nina to play the role of the protagonist, even though he is unsure of her prospects in the portrayal of the black swan, the double of the pious white swan, and this is where the conflict strikes. A clattering windmill of admonitions, cheering ups and even sexual stimulations could not fully unveil darkness in the angelic diva. What Leroy doesn't realize is that Nina is too unpretentious to don the dark attire without hurting herself in the process. She is gullible, she is scared. Under the authority of her overbearing mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), Nina is a child of subservience lacking heavily in the power to assert herself. But her journey to the realm of darkness begins with the advent of her competitor Lily (Mila Kunis), a sexually deviant female exuding the aura of darkness in every breath. She is a natural ""black swan,"" and Thomas Leroy casts her as Nina's alter in the drama. Feeling thwarted and wronged Nina peels off her suave exterior and displays the characteristics of the dark, primeval self.The thrilling suspense of the movie grips you from the beginning. The atmosphere of darkness, the cerebral horror, Nina's doppelganger, all predict a grim finale for the narrative. The disturbing scenes of graphic injuries send chills down your spine and you are left with the cardiac organ getting crazy inside your rib-cage.Black Swan is a perfectly written Gothic novel where each scene is chronologically threaded with the next. Despite the marked ambiguity of certain events, Black Swan comes out as a drama that doesn't require a high gray-matter content to decipher. Of late, several Hollywood pieces (Inception, for example) have used the decipher-it-yourself technique in their works leaving a sizeable portion of audience vying for the correct interpretation of the cinematic riddle, and thereby making them focus their attention on the mathematical calculation rather than on deriving pure pleasure from the motion picture. But appreciation of art is not a forced process; it is natural and spontaneous. Black Swan deftly balances this artistic truth with perfect harmony, and the resultant magnum opus therefore comes out flawless and un-blemished. The subtle movements in the plot, the astounding visual effects and the incommensurable depth in the story leave the audience spell-bound. Never for the moment the plot seems thin or dragged out, never does the director lose his focus. In fact, the entire effort shows so much perfection that I, like many of my co-viewers, sat appreciating the work even after the final credits have rolled.A review of Black Swan would be incomplete without a paragraph of homage to its protagonist. Natalie Portman has surpassed herself in the role of Nina. She is beyond perfect. She is a cross between an arch-angelic superwoman and a half-baked adult with no sexual experience. Her transmogrification strikes us as the wrath of hell. I still feel the goosebumps on my skin when I recall the miniate-eyes of the black swan. Portman's academic background as a pupil of psychiatry has undoubtedly helped her drink in the tricky role to perfection. She has come a long way from the brat in the Closer; she seems more matured. Her final words go through you like a pair of sharp knives inflicted on an already wounded surface. ""That was perfect,"" she says as volumes of unspoken emotion fill her eyes, and then she empties her lungs; an artist sacrificed at the altar of art.The supporting cast in the movie balances the spectacular lead performance. Mina Kunis is exquisite as Lily. She too seemed matured and out of the cocoon of Jackie (Kunis's character in ""That 70's show""). She is a woman of great attraction, not the starry eyed teenager in love with unicorns. Barbara Hershey as Nina's imperious parent seems more like the wicked witch holding the pretty princess captive rather than a mother-cum-career-coach of her ballerina daughter. Winona Ryder as Beth also deserves a round of applause. Despite appearing in only a handful of scenes, her presence is vital in the drama.The chiaroscuro like cinematography is breathtaking, and so are the editing and sound effects. The director Darren Aronofsky plies with the audience's expectation and unfolds before their eyes a drama of a lifetime. This epic tale of innocence killed at the hand of its vicious replicate is one of the best cinematographic renderings in 2010. After Christopher Nolan's Inception, Black Swan comes out as the second biggest hit of the year.",,Anonymous,Drama
"Gripping from start to finish, whether or not you're interested in ballet","Black Swan is the story of a young ballet dancer named Nina, played by Natalie Portman, who dances for a production company that is apparently in financial trouble. The upcoming production is a new version of Swan Lake, in which both the White Swan and the Black Swan, are to be played by one dancer. Nina is keen to get the part and eventually does, but she soon discovers it's much more emotionally taxing than she expected.Now, I don't know a thing about ballet. Before I saw Black Swan I didn't even know what Swan Lake was actually about. But since I'm a fan of psychological dramas, such an unfamiliar setting in this genre is exactly what appealed to me; this was going to be a little bit different. An art form as skilled and precise as ballet needs a skilled hand to depict convincingly on screen, and director Darren Aronofsky is the man to do just that. The pacing of the film is very tight; no scene drags or feels rushed and the gradual build-up of Nina's descent into madness accumulates very steadily.In terms of performances, everybody is perfectly cast; I particularly liked Vincent Cassell as the perfectionist director. Probably the most convincing performance though, is Barbara Hershey as Nina's control-freak mother. Throughout the film this character presents a very two-faced attitude, and the subtle ways in which she changes from a beaming smile one moment, to an indignant stare the next, appears very real and always makes you feel uneasy. Basically no one else could have played this role.The film does run into some problems when the 'horror' elements start working there way into the foreground. This is obviously what the writers and Darren Aronofsky were going for and it does work in principle, but there are just a few moments that are slightly over-the-top and, well, a little bit silly. Some of the more surreal moments incorporate certain CGI/post-production enhancements, and this bothered me for a couple of reasons. Firstly, they just look out of place with the rest of film. Secondly, Aronofsky has proved in his earlier work (Pi and Requiem For A Dream) that he is capable of creating paranoia and disorientation purely through the editing of what he has already shot.This could have been a lot worse though (I'm grateful there wasn't any full-blown CGI monsters in sight), and only taint the overall film rather than ruin it. Black Swan is good, it's very good, but just falls short of being exceptional. Still, it's too well made, too well acted and too entertaining to dismiss outright because of its flaws, and I highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Very Good Watch, But Not Great. Overpraised, Somewhat.","Highly stylised, intriguing production nicely woven with the Swan Lake story. But also sometimes very predictable, clichéd, and no more incisive than TV-series-level thriller.There are plenty of elements of psychological horror, all of which you'll be familiar with and offer no real suspense - we've been down this road many, many times before.I was expecting something darker and deeper after reading many fanboy reviews on here. I'd hoped for a treasure akin to Jacob's Ladder in psychological mainstream horror/thriller terms but ultimately this was Diet Lyne/Demme for figure-conscious ballerina types.But this does sound as if I have a downer on it. No. Black Swan deserves to hold its head above the monotonous waters of 2010's film fodder.It does so mainly thanks to the performance of Natalie Portman. From Leon's jailbait sidekick to yawnsome Star Wars royalty to prima ballerina, she's grown into a sometimes stunningly beautiful woman and refined actress.She carries her character's dramatic personality shifts effortlessly and is completely convincing. None of the supporting cast let anyone down and all-round they work well with an occasionally fragile script.The story itself is conveyed skilfully enough to absorb anyone unfamiliar with the world of ballet (hello, fellow blokes) and the dramatic hooks snag effectively to hold your attention even if the subject matter is completely alien (hello again, fellas).I suspect many gushing reviews are from those who willed this forte into the ballet world to be a success and may be slightly blinkered as to its merits on a strictly thriller level.All in, however, is is a welcome alternative to the usual lame fare. Doesn't deserve nominations but does deserve a mention and a recommendation for all. A good 7.5 out of 10.Liked it but won't be watching again until its on terrestrial TV.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Swan Lake is the Life Cycle,"The Black Swan is the type of movie that you are shocked at how it will illicit so many emotions considering you either know the story before hand or within the first 2 minutes of the film. The themes, symbolism, and story are laid out for you and even though you know what's around every turn you can't get out of the way of the basic human notions that are within each and every one of us. A Swan is born into innocence, loses it's innocence along the way, and finds it again only in death.Miss Portman's character Nina can no more escape her natural progression to become the Black Swan any more than she could escape becoming ,Miss Ryder's character, Beth. Nina's scratching of her skin was the Black Swan trying to escape the prison within. Nina was trapped in a series of motions (as we all are) with Nina's progression to become the exact same as Beth's. Mr. Cassel's character Thomas is the constant. He is God, or the Devil or both in every character's world. Pulling on the strings that make the dancers dance and tugs on the strings of Nina's mind and innocence. Referring to Nina with the same affection reserved for the once great Beth.There are often comparisons between Nina and Ms. Kunis character, Lily, as Nina being the White Swan and Lily the Black Swan. I think in many ways Lily with her free spirit had an innocence in her deviance, her carefree approach and lust for life was certainly unjaded. She had more difficulty losing the blackness to play the white than Nina did losing the white to play the black.Mr. Aronofsky likes to remind us of the duality of people. The strength and power of the mind vs it's fragility, as he did in Pi. Black Swan, the Wrestler, and Requiem for a Dream look at life through simple and yet complex glasses with the same frailty and power that take place through self image and desire.What better conscience is there than one's mother and Ms. Hershey's character is one that played the role well. She had power and became powerless just as one is to nature. Nina must destroy the hand that protects her and keeps her from evolving.I saw this movie with my wife and we discussed it at length, where she wondered did this scene really happen or did that scene ""really"" happen. ""None of it was relevant yet it was all relevant"", I stated. It is the fact that none of it was inescapable, which goes back to the beginning. We all knew what would happen yet we try to figure out the mystery and feel if we can save Nina we can save ourselves, yet we also can deduce (and take solace) that salvation is inevitable.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Okay, I understand that this not supposed to be light entertainment. But man, this is hard. Mila Kunis was also excellent in the contrasting role.

"Brilliant, Amazing, Splendid, and then utter disappointment","Starting with an almost unpolished demeanor, Black Swan slowly builds into an amazing movie experience, but then it just... Let's start from the beginning.The opening shots depict the confidence of Darren Aronofsky, rugged, almost washed out and without visual substance, luring the viewer into a false sense of security. Slowly and surely, Black Swan builds into an intense and believable depiction of the unappreciated and misunderstood dedication that this discipline requires. The underlying force here is the lure to achieve perfection, the bait that ensnares the perfectionist into thinking that such a thing is possible, where fate brings one to the brink, the precarious edge, and then whispers into the hopeful ear that to jump is to own.Natalie Portman is simply perfect in this role. Her fanatic drive for perfection would impress the most ardent of Nazis, a belief that life itself can be cheated through dogged preparation. The cracks of reality that occasionally slip through are splendidly ignored, and not until the end do we see just how bent this determination is. Mila Kunis chirps in a surprising good performance, the perfect counterpoint to Portman's Nina, dedicatedly unleashed and all the more perfect because of it. Vincent Cassel, what can I say? This guy owns every role. While he plays a rather unlikable character here, it is one that perfectly balances the ambiguity of his intentions. Is his core filled with ooze or is his love of the craft so intense that he will opportune any moment to drive artistic heights out of his dancers? Vying for top honors, the camera work goes head to head with Portman's performance. This is no surprise, but its dazzling effects, from the voyeuristic walking of Nina, a symbol of her journey that demonstrates her denouement through the camera's increasingly agitated ambling, to the agile capacity that the camera demonstrates, almost cavorting with the dancers themselves, was simply phenomenal.The editing and direction was typical Aronofsky, his style an earmark of artistry, toned down when appropriate but ramped up to MTV speed for effect, as can be seen in the dance club scene.The story was a superb take on the brutality that life has to offer this pursuit. These dancers are to both strive for perfection and yet must also live their lives; they live the perfect polar impossibility, for they must dedicate their every ounce of existence towards perfecting their craft but must also live life such that their performance is based on more than just sheer preparation. How these performers do no go postal is one of life's greater mysteries. As the story moves forward and to its end, as it builds up a momentum that is just barely tolerable, the viewer becomes strapped to the seat, electrocuted with anticipation as to how this thriller will execute its final moments, white knuckles all the way.And then it ends, suddenly and without much fuss. This ending makes perfect sense, and I guess to some it might seem a brutal finality, but to me it was so lackluster that I could not help but feel cheated. I mean, really, that's it, that's the payoff? Maybe my expectations were too high, but in almost ever other moment of this showing I was suitably Wowed by the performance but then left unfulfilled, hollow even, as the credits rolled. Had I walked out just moments before the last scene I bet this would have been considered Oscar worthy, but instead I cannot help but feel spurned, and alone, a feeling that only a chocolate shake heavily spiked with Gran Marnier could fix.

Where's the depth?,"Here we go again. The key to perfect art is sex. Hollywood's holy grail trotted out once again as the be-all and end-all; instant (or at least overnight) transformation.So Portman's virginal (that was once a compliment) Nina needs only to try a little masturbation, lesbian sex (it's 2011, right - straight, horizontal hetero sex is now passe') once or twice, and having shed frigidity and plunged into what is purported to be the real wellspring of her art, will now automatically turn into a prima ballerina worth the title.But any real authority on ballet will tell you that the depth of balletic perfection, of its transcendent artistry, comes from somewhere far more complex than simple physical orgasm. It takes years of practice and heroic concentration and focus in expressing those deep feelings so that they leap over the foodlights from the stage and touch the heart.Sure, an artist's sexuality is part of the deal - but it's not the whole enchilada. Neither is sexual inexperience a detriment to once's art - in fact, there's something to be said for the power of unfulfilled desire to drive powerful artistic expression.Having said all that about the film's shallow premise, I would also say the Black Swan was visually entertaining - beautifully photographed, compelling imagery, seamless storytelling, and glorious special effects that drove home the emotional content. I loved - and wanted even more of - the increasingly mad dance sequence that led up to those gorgeously flapping black wings.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
great disappointment!,"Now after watching the film, i can't explain the positive feed-back, what's happening?! :( The movie is sadistic, confusing, boring, not convincing. The atmosphere was oppressive, i couldn't wait for it to end. The scenes do not justify Nina's exaggerated drama, her overwhelming sadness goes to far when nothing really happens. In fact, the story has no substance, no credibility. As for the good things, are there any? Portman's performance was not bad, i think, though she doesn't have an expressive face. A film that is NOT worth seeing! Don't be cheated by the good reviews. Really, how can they be so far from the truth?!",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Nightmarish, horrifying, and ultimately Spectacular!","I had recently gathered interest in seeing Black Swan because the reviews made it out to be very original and bizarre, and that combination is something I always look for. Turns out the reviews were right.I have only seen two other films by Darren Aronofsky- The Fountain and The Wrestler. While The Fountain was a good film, it was heavily flawed but it did try something unique and was a visual experience. The Wrestler was the complete opposite. It turned out to be a better film than The Fountain but it had a much more conventional storyline with great characters and his direction was very simple and realistic. Here, we have a film that combines elements of both those films.Black Swan is very much as much of a horror film as the genre tends to look for. Actually, it is much more horrifying than I would expect all of the award groups to be noticing, which is why I am surprised by the awards it has garnered. It is a film of mystifying beauty. If you are looking for subtle direction and writing, look elsewhere. Aronofsky thrives on the over-the-top theatrical style with loud, classical music. He gives the film a nightmarish feeling of mystery and dread while still focusing on Nina. Natalie Portman goes all out in this one, creating a character who seems like much of what we have seen before but whose dedication to the project might be her flaw. I do not want to give much away, so I will stop there. I am surprised by how far Mila Kunis has come, the girl from That 70s Show. Her role is small, but I cannot imagine anyone else in the role and am glad Aronofsky took a risk with her.Black Swan is certainly not a film for everyone, and let's appreciate it even more for that. It is certainly Aronofsky's only near-masterpiece thus far (and by near I mean that it is a hard film to truly grasp on first viewing, so more viewings are in store). Also that ending is masterful and compares with The Wrestler in that respect.",,Anonymous,Drama
And so it was perfect,"Black Swan can only be described as a complete tour de force. From Aronofsky's intensely dark and layered direction to Portman's incredible, transfixing performance, the film attains perfection in my eyes.I won't go into plot details in this particular review because it's better the film is best viewed in order to take you by storm rather than me spoil any aspect of it here. I use the phrase ""take you by storm"" for a reason, the film is a breathtaking ordeal conveyed by powerful direction and performances. Portman delivers the most unbelievable performance of 2010 and the rest of the cast is nothing short of amazing. I'm pulling for Hershey to be nominated at this year's Oscars in particular. If Portman does not actually win the golden statue this year, it will be one of their greatest disappointments along with Rourke's loss in 2008 and Blanchett's loss in 1997.This is a beautiful, dark, and emotionally wrenching film. Its reward lies in the fact that it is a consummate masterpiece. I may be using a ton of hyperbole here, but I really do believe this is the best piece of cinema I have ever seen in a theater. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who wishes to observe what cinematic perfection truly is. I'm sure whether you think so or not, after you view it, the idea of perfection will undoubtedly linger in your mind long after you see it. ;)",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
This swan was superb,"I saw Black Swan and it was without a doubt the most superb film I have seen in recent memory.It was perfectly paced. The acting was tremendous. The plot captivated from the beginning. It was visually spectacular and stylized very, very well. It made me think of how fragile the human mind can be, and how often we are our own worst enemy.In short it had it all - and was not a piece of garbage like so many films made these days.I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a well-crafted film. Natalie Portman gave an Oscar worthy performance. Barbara Hershey was the quintessential passive-aggressive controlling stage mother with the right hint of bitterness. Also Oscar worthy. Mila Kunis was impressive. Nice to see Winona Ryder is a small but pivotal and role that stood out. And the guy who played the ballet director was perfectly creepy.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Too good to watch,"This is possibly the best movie I have seen for a long, long time. It was next to flawless. I hated it. The direction is incredible, with camera angles, scene usage and lighting being used to their utmost. Portman's acting is the most Oscar worthy I think I have ever seen. I will never look at her the same again. So, why did I hate it? Because it was too good at what it intended to do - to show you the mind of a deeply psychologically disturbed person. The combination of acting and direction made me feel as if I was undergoing all of her fears, rather than just watching them on the screen. At the beginning you want to protect Portman, and feel terrible at the isolated world of bitchiness and exploitation that she is in - a world too intense and demanding for someone as delicate as her. This is perhaps the brilliance of casting Portman for this role. She is naturally a very delicate person, whose beauty owes to the innocence of her looks. This is an innocence which, as a man raised to be a gentleman, I feel obliged to protect. But in pretty much every single scene in the entire movie, her innocence is being tested, exploited, broken down and abused. By the end you are terrified of her and what she has become. There is not one single moment in the movie that did not have me wincing and tensing, and once the movie was finished it took a long time for me to relax. Had the acting and directing been less than brilliant I think I could have shrugged it off a bit more easily. If you are in any way sensitive towards the subject of female suffering in film, then under no circumstances watch this movie. If you are harder and less sensitive towards other, then under no circumstances miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Black Swan: 9/10,"It is one film of the year where I walk out of the theater and went, Hmm, nice! Well, that doesn't mean it's better than some other films I saw this year, but this is an impressive. Black Swan offers plenty of drama, plenty of thrilling moments, and plenty of sexiness. With a thrilling and perplexed performance by Natalie Portman, and stylish directing from Darren Aronofsky, Black Swan can go far. The story is more complicated than you think it is. It is not just about a ballet dancer, it is about a ballet dancer with deep mental issues. Nina is professional ballet dancer who got promoted to play the key role in a ballet performance, the Swan Queen. With a lot of pressure on her, the story proposes that she is obviously hallucinating about her body being deform. At first, I thought all of this was real because Natalie Portman is so believable. But as the story developed, I know for a fact that this girl has some serious mental issues. A summary about the film really doesn't do it justice, go watch it and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. Black Swan demonstrates how ballet is as exciting and thrilling as an action movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger in it. Natalie Portman might even win the Best Actress Oscar, that is if she beat Annette Bening (but she already locked herself an Oscar nod). Darren Aronofsky will probably snatch the Best Director nod, but Black Swan will definitely have a chance at the Best Picture run.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

The movie is a quite well description of psychiatric problem. One may think even about schizophrenic hallucinations of the swan"".

Black Swan: Not Just For Ballerinas,"Black Swan is just another example of burgeoning director, Darren Aronofsky, flexing his muscles to prove that he is the king of getting in to the eager viewer's head and sending them on an experience that transcends the screen.Black Swan tells the story of the dedicated ballerina, Nina Sayer (Natalie Portman), as she is given the lead role in an avant-garde version of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. In Thomas Leroy's (Vincent Cassel), the ballet's director, version of the classic ballet the role of the Swan Queen is divided in to two parts, the White Swan and the Black Swan, that are to be played by the same ballerina.In the eyes of Thomas, Nina is the perfect candidate for the White Swan. She is sweet, innocent, and unexposed to the world of temptations around her. Where her skill and devotion to the art of ballet do not help her is in the case of the Black Swan. Thomas makes aggressive sexual passes at Nina, kissing her against her will and telling her to touch herself just to see how being bad feels are simply the beginning of his attempts to prepare her for a part that requires charged passion above ability.Slowly, as Nina becomes more engrossed in her attempts to become the ideal candidate for the part of the Swan Queen, she loses her mind. Between her over-bearing ex-ballerina of a mother (Barbara Hershey) and the other dancer vying for her position (or is she?), Lily (Mila Kunis), Nina is thrown in a world much darker than the role requires.The beauty of this film is based in its ability to get at the viewer. The idea of who is the ""good guy"" and who is the ""bad guy"" is constantly being challenged and blurred until the lines are indistinguishable by those both in the movie and those watching from afar.The film brilliantly mimics what Thomas is trying to accomplish in the ballet itself. Rather than the parts being clear-cut and easy to see, it requires a sharper eye to realize who is playing a certain role at any given moment. Basically, guessing and anticipating is the name of the game and the only way to play is to stay pinned to the back of your seat with every passing moment.After having seen this film I am only inclined to see it again and again. I do not have beyond a shade of doubt that every time I see it I will experience something new as a result of its depth and brilliance of story telling.The last Big Five (Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Actress in a Leading Role, and Best Screenplay) winner at the Oscars was the Silence of the Lambs in 1992. I have no problem predicting that this film might just take all five of them.Good work Mr. Aronofsky. Good work.For more see:http://pocketwatches-e.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Portman is great, but this movie is one of worst I've ever seen","Worse than Zardoz, worse than Ishtar, anything.Zero understanding of ballet leads to ridiculous major premise: ""ooh, to do zee black swan you need to be The sexeee!"" This is utter nonsense. Anyone who knows anything about ballet and in particular, Swan Lake, knows this. But the writer tries to get away with this huge, vulgar misunderstanding--and he doesn't get away with it.Uses every cliché in the book, and every vile sexist cliché, too: baad mommy (the cake! the cake!,ooh!, the horror, the horror!), classic controlling abusive artiste dom male who uh feels that masturbation is the answer to everything; pseudo-ballerina actresses who look, speak, and act like leftovers from teen slash movies.

Rather aim than go with the shotgun,"I'll skip the plot entirely for this review as the one given by IMDb is more than enough. That is to say you can describe it all with a few words and still risk spoiling the whole experience.Not all true though. Behind the quite predictable storyline lies some pretty good scenes and amazingly good acting from our main character Nina played by Natalie Portman. She makes the story believable at least subjectively, told from inside her own perspective. If you can manage the cheesy character of her producer, Thomas Leroy, the rest of the cast does a good job.For you out there interested in a mysterious thriller have something to look forward to in Black Swan, because even if you figure out how the story will end around 20 minutes in you will still feel the thrill of every scene. There's something cosy about occasionally getting your heart rate up and having total focus on the screen. The Silence of the Lambs and Gothika comes to mind here as a combination for a fitting comparison. Only lacking the true mystery behind an intelligent MS and being predictable hinders Black Swan from becoming a real blockbuster. What I like then is that it doesn't seem to be produced to bring good sales only, but rather to be a meaningful experience within the genre.If you get a blanket for the youngest this is a movie for the whole family.

Overrated To The Max,"The hype for this movie is way out of proportion to its quality. I found I tolerated this film more then I enjoyed it. The story, artistic merit and even the performances have been extremely overstated. The thing I was most disappointed in was Aronofsky's direction or at least the use of his camera. I swear that 50% of this film is a steady cam shot five inches from Natalie Portman's face. 10% is more hand-cam directly on her shoulder. One thing's for sure, I hope Aronofsky leaves the hand held stuff at home when he films The Wolverine. Maybe he wanted this film to feel claustrophobic and jarring but it was very distracting and even nauseating at times.",,Anonymous,Drama

Perhaps the first great cinematic masterpiece of the 2010s,"In the ballet world it has become the custom for the two leading female roles in Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake"", Odette the White Swan and Odile the Black Swan, to be danced by the same ballerina in order to allow her to reveal two different sides of her personality, Odette being innocent and ethereal, Odile evil but sensual and sexually fascinating. ""Black Swan"" tells the story of a new production of ""Swan Lake"" by a leading New York ballet company and the rivalry between two young dancers, Nina and Lily, who both covet the role of Odette/Odile. The director, Thomas Leroy, casts Nina in the role, although he has doubts as to her suitability. She is perfect as the White Swan, but Thomas fears she lacks the sensuality needed to portray the Black Swan, a role to which Lily seems more suited. (I found myself wondering why Leroy, who clearly sees himself as an iconoclast, did not simply cast two different dancers in the two roles, but this would obviously have been a step too far for ballet traditionalists).Nina's problem is that she is too emotionally repressed to portray the Black Swan convincingly. She is a virgin who does not have a boyfriend and lives with her controlling, overbearing mother Erica, herself a former dancer who never quite made it to the top and who has projected her own unrealised hopes onto her daughter. Thomas criticises Nina's dancing as ""frigid"", and this is as much a criticism of her personality as of her dance style. Gradually, however, Nina begins, under Thomas's guidance, to explore the darker and more sensual sides of her character and her dancing begins to improve.Nina's success, however, is only achieved at great personal cost. The emotional stress of the role begins to affect her health, both physical and mental, leading to eating disorders, self-harm and to hallucinations. Nina becomes obsessed with Lily, who has been named as her understudy, and with the idea that Lily is trying to usurp her role. Yet her relationship with Lily is a love-hate one; at one stage she hallucinates that she is having a lesbian relationship with the other girl. Or is this something more than a hallucination? Natalie Portman is an actress who has sometimes disappointed me in the past. She was horribly wooden in the ""Star Wars"" films and not a lot better in ""V for Vendetta"". In ""Black Swan"", however, she is superb in the highly demanding role of Nina, a role which required her not only to master the dancing skills of a ballerina but also to convey her character's complex emotional states. Her Best Actress Oscar was well deserved. Mila Kunis is also good as Lily, although this role was perhaps an easier one. Although it demanded just as much hard work on the technical ballet side, Lily is a less complicated character than her rival, naturally sensual and easy-going where Nina is tense and emotionally repressed.The other performance which impressed me came from Vincent Cassel as Thomas. The relationship between Thomas and Nina in some ways parallels that between Lermontov and Victoria in that other great ballet film, ""The Red Shoes"". Like Lermontov, Thomas is in love, or in lust, with his protégée, but with an important difference. Lermontov's love for Victoria takes the form of a subconscious desire which he cannot acknowledge to her or even to himself, except in sublimated form. There is nothing sublimated or subconscious about Thomas's desire for Nina; he takes an obsessive interest in her sex-life, encourages her to masturbate and blatantly gropes her while they are dancing together. At the purely technical level his psychological manipulation of Nina succeeds in making her a better dancer, but he cannot see the effect that his methods are having on her already fragile psyche. In a compelling performance Cassel plays him as a strange mixture of inspirational teacher and creepy sexual predator; he was unfortunate not to receive a ""Best Supporting Actor"" nomination.Visually, the look of ""Black Swan"" is very different to that of ""The Red Shoes"". Pressburger and Powell's masterpiece, made during a period of post-war austerity, was shot in vivid colour. Darren Aronofsky's palette is much more restrained; in keeping with the film's theme the dominant tones are black, white and grey. Bright colours are used sparingly, with the exception of red in a key scene near the end. Aronofsky's direction also uses many shots from unusual angles; it is notable that Portman is frequently photographed from behind or in a mirror, as though her character were hiding something from the audience by turning away from them, thus emphasising Nina's repressed personality. Aronofsky also makes considerable use of ambiguity- the lesbian scene being a good example. The most likely explanation is that it is a hallucination on Nina's part, but it can also be taken as a depiction of something that actually happened, in which case it makes an immense difference to the way in which we perceive both Nina and Lily. The final scene also permits two different interpretations.""Black Swan"" was the first of Aronofsky's films that I have seen, but on this evidence he is a director of enormous talent. It is in my view the greatest-ever film about ballet, greater even than ""The Red Shoes"", which is high praise indeed. It is a film of great aesthetic, dramatic and emotional power, a power which is enhanced by Tchaikovsky's music on the soundtrack. It is perhaps the first great cinematic masterpiece of the 2010s; although it may be unpatriotic to say so, I would have awarded it ""Best Picture"" ahead of ""The King's Speech"" and certainly Aronofsky ""Best Director"" ahead of Tom Hooper. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

madness to Chaikovsky,"If Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" doesn't haunt you, then nothing will. Natalie Portman plays Nina, a young woman training for a role in a production of Pyotr Chaikovsky's ""Swan Lake"". She gets the role of the White Swan, but the intense pressure on her, along with the presence of another ballerina (Mila Kunis) who Nina suspects is trying to usurp the role, sends Nina into complete madness.The scenes of dancers gracefully performing ballet is the perfect contrast to intense scenes showing Nina's breakdown. Some of the scenes made me squirm (and I'm usually someone who can take anything in a movie). Much of the movie is shot with a hand-held camera, heightening the tension. Much like he did with ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"", Aronofsky does a perfect job showing a disturbing descent into insanity.I saw a production of ""Swan Lake"" in the Mariinsky Theater while I was in St. Petersburg. I recognized the theme song from somewhere else (I don't remember where). That has to be the most haunting piece of music ever written. Having watched ""Black Swan"", I'm now wondering what was going on behind the production that I saw! Anyway, this is definitely one that I recommend. I didn't see every movie from 2010, so I can't say for certain whether or not Natalie Portman's performance was the best from that year, but she was definitely up there.In conclusion, be suspicious the next time that you see a member of the genus Cygnus.Also starring Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey, Winona Ryder and Benjamin Millepied.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A good, messy movie about obsession with perfection.","My Rating : 7/10I think of Black Swan as a journey into the dark uncharted places in your mind. Aronofsky made The Wrestler two years earlier which I found absolutely brilliant so I suggest viewers to check that one out as well, they are both very similar in a lot of ways, the scene which ends both movies convey the same emotional punch which is of accomplishment at the cost of one's sanity and the mental and physical exhaustion and obsession with achieving perfection.I would like to have given an 8 or 9 rating and the reason for it not excelling as much is perhaps because I would have liked it to be even more twisted, I was looking for an element of horror such as The Shining or Rosemary's Baby in here which I didn't find. Also, I wished there was a more memorable background score to really tie the film neatly. It is more a psychological affair with Natalie Portman's character exploring her repressed emotions and her virgin-like innocence bothering her from becoming the black swan.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Along with her sanity on line she is beginning to feel she is losing her part in the production of Swan lake, to a dance sister named Lily. If it wasn't enough pressure on Nina to have to deal with her sanity, that could soon be gone, and losing her role in the play, she goes home to a unstable mom. Her mom is lost in her own failure as a dancer and can not accept the fact she never made it. Nina's mom blames it on her that she never made it has a dancer. She wants her to succeed so bad that she pushes Nina to hard.The Relationship between Nina and Lily in this movie is extremely intense, passionate, provocative and mentally thrilling. Lily seems to take advantage of Nina's situation and send Nina done an even darker path of her own destruction. Lily please a creepy and sexual character, yet at times she is just a regular friendly girl that does nothing wrong. Nina in this situation starts to blame her problems and struggles on Lily and that Lily is trying to get her out of the show and take her place as the lead ballet dancer dong the White and Black Swan.Nina is trying to make sure she can keep it together.

Like why did Nina pick to fear Lily from the beginning what reasoning did she have for Lily? Why did Lily come to this place to dance what did she do prior to dancing at this studio?

"A white swan decays, and a black swan germinate","WOW! Just wow! Black Swan just blew me away, in every way that a movie should. There is a beautiful balance throughout the movie between the sane and the psychotic and the beauty and the grotesque. You would think the movie might be all about dance, but it really isn't. There is very little talk about the dance steps, and the names of the dance steps, which is perfect if you're not really into dance. The characters have a lot of debt – even the mother who does not have a big role, acts like the supporting mother, when really she's manipulating her daughter into thinking it's her idea. The Swan Lake ballet is an allegory of the protagonist's life on the outside. Her obsession with being perfect and loved, makes her unable to distinguish between reality and dark character in the play. Beautiful cinematography, excellent acting and a hot and raw sex scene, tastefully done. And it keeps you guessing 'till the very end – and perhaps after as the interpretation is not carved in stone.

Surprisingly camp,"Darren Aronofsky's film 'Black Swan' tells the story of a ballet dancer driven to madness by her paranoid fears of her fellow cast members and the challenge of expressing two sides of her own personality in an important double role. I'm no expert on ballet, but to me one problem of this film is that Natalie Portman so palpably conveys her growing discomfort in the role that she doesn't seem credible as the lead; the sense to which she appears ill-at-ease would surely lead to any director casting someone else in her stead. I also found the character is closed to the audience; the film didn't do enough to make me care about her.

Aronofsky wins again,"Darren Aronofsky is certainly a talented director. PI was an intriguing debut, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM capitalised on that promise with astonishing clarity, THE FOUNTAIN was deeply flawed, but THE WRESTLER was back on track, a heartfelt, faux documentary-cum-character study of a broken man. The good news is that BLACK SWAN is another winner, a creepy and intriguing little movie that's all about the mystery.Although the film is ostensibly about ballet, in reality this is one of those 'slowly losing their mind' type films a la THE MACHINIST. The type of film where the protagonist is plagued by weird visions, delusions and nightmare, a generally subtle effort punctuated by grisly little moments of wince-inducing violence. The screenplay is intelligent and mature, focusing on the characters throughout, and the movie is equally viewable in both the dialogue and dance sequences.I've never liked Natalie Portman, but it's a credit to Aronofsky that she's captivating here and precisely chosen as the porcelain figure leading the show. There are some fine supporting parts as well, particularly from a spiky Mila Kunis, a suave Vincent Cassel (seriously, this man can do no wrong) and a where's-she-been? Winona Ryder.

"Intoxicating and disturbing, bravo!","I am just back from the movie theatre where I saw the UK advanced screening of Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan (it will be released nationwide on January 21st).The movie opens with the main character Nina who dances alone on a dark stage of what it seems to be a ballet company theatre and since this very first scene we, as audience, are captivated by her obsessive, and at the same time intoxicating movements.Parallels between Black Swan and The Wrestler are unavoidable, even if here the fragility of mind is the main issue Nina is facing while Rourke's Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson fought the off age passion for the ring.Jealousy and fear to lose her life awaited lead role in the Swan Lake ballet are not the only reasons which make Nina's life so difficult. We also have pressures from a way too domineering mother (Barbara Hershley) and advices from a way too pushy choreographer (Vincent Cassel) who believes she can deliver the ""White Swan"", but is too frigid to play the ""Black Swan"".Nina's obsession with perfection will take her to a horrific and complete identification with the role she is playing in the Swan Lake, which is in many cases disturbing.Aronofsky's talented style which introduces thriller and even horror elements in a so complicated drama, pulls the best out of his actors and as Rourke and Marisa Tomei in The Wrestler also here we have a bunch of talented actors who are showing magnificent performances: first of all Portman (she dances for real), but also Cassel, Hersley, Kunis and Wynona Ryder.A must see, highly recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Some of her scenes in the movie are excellent and Disturbing,and in this movie she really shows her natural talent and she totally deserved her Oscar for this role. Also a good performance from Mila Kunis as Lily and she does her role very well in the movie, and also strong performances from Barbara Hershey,Winona Ryder and Vincent Cassel in their respective roles.Excellent Work from Director Darren Aronofsky who is quite bold in making this kind of a movie and makes a gem out of the movie. He also did a great job in making his actors adapt to their roles, especially the role of Portman which is a very complex one, and also doing well with the ballet dances in the movie and the scenes in the movie excellently and top marks to him for making such a gripping thriller.He proved that he is a very talented director by making this great movie.The Story of the movie is excellent and it shows the life of Nina and her obsession of perfecting the roles of the White Swan and the Black Swan and her cracking up in the movie brilliantly and great job from great job from Andres Heinz for writing such a great and gripping story and also good jobs from Screen-writers Mark Heyman, John McLaughlin and Heinz himself and great job from director Aronofsky for utilizing the story superbly and making this into a great film.The Choreography of this movie is superb as the Ballets shown in the movie are quite great and great job from Choreographer Benjamin Millepied(who is also the fiancé of Portman and an actor in this movie) for making specially Portman who surely had to take lessons for ballerina do the ballets superbly. The Music which is taken from ''Swan Lake' by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky is divine, from the first second the movie starts the background music is excellent, and the music in the last ballets are beautiful and great work from music director Clint Mansell for giving a beautiful background music in the film.This movie is really one of the best psychological thrillers of the decade and you have to see this movie patiently to understand it fully, and its greatness if mostly due to the marvelous performance from Natalie Portman and the excellent directional work from Darren Aronofsky to make it a real film to watch for every movie lover.My Rating: 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"brilliant, intense movie that seems to encourage incredibly pretentious reviews here","At the end of this movie I was about to turn to my girlfriend and say ""that was intense"" when she turned to me and said ""that was intense."" The movie, and especially the last, absolutely stunning sequence, is incredibly intense. Natalie Portman as a driven perfectionist is amazing, giving a performance more about nervous, tense looks and bottled up emotions than about dialogue. Barbara Hershey is also incredible as her mother, ostensibly supportive but suffused with terrifying jealousy.The movie puts the viewer squarely in Portman's mind, and we have as much trouble as she does in understanding what is really happening and what is her vivid imagination.I think this movie has a lot in common with Roman Polanski's Repulsion, although I saw the latter so long ago that I can't say more about it than that, except that if you like one I'd recommend watching the other as well.I note an unusually large number of IMDb user reviews having a very pretentious tone to them. I understand why. At the end of the movie, I felt like I should have a lot to say about it, because it was such an intense experience, but I actually don't. And the reviews I've read here seem to be written by people who want to say something profound about the movie but instead just say kind of silly things. I think this movie is such a visceral experience that it is very difficult to talk about, but it is well worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Deflowering the repressed,"Darren Aronofsky is no stranger to the psychological thriller, a sub- genre Black Swan fits in comfortably. Like Aronofsky's first film, Pi, Black Swan depicts an internal struggle between selves, the grappling for equilibrium, and the external manifestations of mental disintegration. However it is more dramatic and more transparent. No shock-value gimmicks here. The sufficiently clever viewer (not necessarily me) can vaguely project the trajectory of the film from early on. As ""The Gentleman"" and stage director, played by Vincent Cassel, says by way of describing Swan Lake: ""Everybody knows the story...""Nonetheless, Black Swan is far from predictable. Suffused with tension and suspense, Aronofsky massages fear and apportions violence and beauty in equal measure. Natalie Portman, apparently a life-long dancer, provides a stunning performance as actress and ballerina. She is enchanting and convincing: she seems like a real pro to amateur eyes. Similarly, Mila Kunis and the rest are stellar dancers and unendingly lovely. Cassel provides a subtle turn as the devious and brilliant theater director. Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder's characters are tragic and forsaken souls with just the right amount of darkness, threat, and suffering.There is a lot to Black Swan. It is symbolically rich and provides all kinds of food for thought for psychological analysis. It's also just good drama, with strong characterization and performances. To top it all off, the soundtrack, at turns pulsating menace and sweeping to salvation, and the claustrophobic, person-centered cinematography make the viewer feel the repression, passion, and fear at every turn. Aronofsky has shown that the psychological thriller is still fertile ground for imaginative, but accessible film-making.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Mediocre,""" Black Swan"" is what happens when Hollywood pretends to be independent. Mediocre script, filled with the simplifications and stereotypes, quirky camera work and decent, but not fabulous acting -it just about sums it all up. Why is it so difficult to have an original idea? There are tens of thousands of creative young people with fresh thinking and clear heads. There are so many good actors that never get a single chance to show what they are made of. Instead failed models and pretty people without anything to offer pretend to act. It works for several years and than they fade away dazed like deer caught in headlights. This is not a bad movie or horrible acting. This is just mediocre, trivial dumbed down little flick. Oscar???

How Could You Hope For Anything More In A Movie,"This is one of the few films I've personally ever come across that from moment one begins - unobtrusively and almost imperceptibly - to draw the viewer in, and then suddenly - before you know it - you're absolutely hooked and unable to let go even if - after the first few minutes - this looked as if it was shaping up to be a good but ultimately forgettable film. In the end, though, director Darren Aronofsky shapes and builds this movie almost perfectly and leaves you with few if any unrealized expectations.In the beginning this all seems so simple. Nina (played brilliantly by Natalie Portman) is a young, shy, nervous, beautiful and technically proficient ballerina who seeks the lead role in a modern production of ""Swan Lake."" The director Thomas (Vincent Cassel) recognizes that her style is perfect for the portrayal of the white swan but that she lacks the necessary ""edge"" to play the black swan. He gives her the role and begins to work with her to get her to explore a riskier, less technically proficient but more passionate side of dancing. At this point it looks like a fairly well-worn type of story, as the movie seems to be shaping up as little more than a study of the rivalries that exist between dancers in a ballet company (which you expect to be taken to an extreme) - and, indeed, rivalries within the company abound - from the dancer that Nina replaced (a somewhat limited role played by Winona Ryder) to one of her fellow ballerinas (Lily, played by Mila Kunis, who brought exactly the right look and feel to the character) who wanted the role and didn't get it, ending up as Nina's alternate. From beginning to end, in the background there's a study of the obviously unhealthy relationship between Nina and her mother (Barbara Hershey) - apparently a former ballerina herself who now wants to live her dream through Nina, who comes across as over- protective and controlling. The characters all have depth, and yet the movie never seems to get bogged down in an intractable character study. We learn about these people as the movie flows effortlessly, portraying Nina's development as a ballerina and her descent as she seems to lose touch with reality, so obsessed does she become with being the black swan.The development of this movie is deliberate but spellbinding, and it never lacks a beat; never leaves you wondering if watching this is worth it. It's both subtle and in your face at the same time. It's sensual and even erotic at times - and yet there's a sense of innocence (especially from Nina) and the sensuality and eroticism are portrayed with (as far as I can recall) not even a single scene of nudity. It's violent at times and yet there's nothing here that's especially graphic. The characters all have you wondering about them. Thomas, Lily and Nina's mother all seem off balance somehow. The controlling mother; Lily who's obsessed with wanting the role and jealous that Nina got it instead; Thomas who comes across as little more than a lecherous director looking for ""favours"" from the dancers, quite frankly. And then in the end it all gets turned around. Were any of these people really what they appeared to be, or did much of this happen in Nina's mind as she became more and more obsessed about her role? That, in the end, is the psychological power of this movie - trying to distinguish the fine line between what's real and what's imagined. Once the movie hits full stride it's hard to make that distinction. The last half hour or so, dealing with the opening night of the ballet and Nina's actual debut performance in the role, is especially gripping.Who'd have thought? I'm not interested in ballet. I've never seen a performance of any ballet - let alone ""Swan Lake."" And yet this movie gives one an appreciation of ballet as an art form and almost convinces me to go and see one. In addition to that, it turns out to be a tense and emotional psychological thriller that leaves not a single bit of disappointment. It is absolutely worthy of the Oscar nominations it's received, and I for one will be especially rooting for Natalie Portman on Oscar night 2011.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Horror Movie Marketed As An Art Film,"I wrestled with whether to submit a review for this reason: everybody is entitled to their own taste in movies, and the mere fact that this movie is not to my taste doesn't make it ""bad."" On the other hand, I note that people who obviously like horror movies have given this movie an enthusiastic rating so that, on balance, I see no reason why I shouldn't rate it ""awful"" based upon my dislike of this genre.The next question I asked myself was whether there was any point in submitting a review -- what could I add beyond simply dissing horror movies. I answer that question this way: I saw this movie because it was released at year's end with an ""Oscar buzz"" and it turns out to be simply a horror movie. It has all the gory scenes and demon-like characters popping up suddenly when a door is opened that is de rigueur in such a flick.The story that underlies this tale profiles the psychiatric torments of a profoundly disturbed individual. As such, this tale could have been told without the gratuitous ""sex"" and without the special effects.

not sure what all the fuss was about,"I finally saw this movie well after Natalie Portman won the Oscar and I don't get why she won. I didn't think this movie or her role were that great. Not really a whole lot even happens. We are left wondering is Nina going crazy. What I assumed from the ending was that the pressure just got to her and started to believe her life was like the white swan she was playing. Where in the end, the swan commits suicide. But I still don't get all the weird visions in the mirror and her ""killing a fellow dancer""; which wasn't real. And her dance instructor was just creepy. And what about Beth, the washed up dancer. Was any of her getting hit by a car real. Did Nina really hurt her in the hospital or just herself. Too many unanswered questions for me.FINAL VERDICT: Does not live up to the hype, skip it.",,Anonymous,Drama
A gorgeous horror movie,"If this movie looks attractive, it is. But don't go into it with a weak stomach. Darren Aronofsky weaves a subtle epic with Black Swan: the story of a fiercely dedicated ballerina and the trials and tribulations she endures while preparing for the role of the Swan Queen in her troupe's performance of Swan Lake.Black Swan is horrifically terrifying, romantically evil, violently sexy and masterfully nuanced. The entire cast of characters are flawless, but Natalie Portman stands out in one of the best performances I've ever seen. But much of what makes Black Swan reverberate within me are the workings of director Darren Aronofsky.There are so many positive things I could say here it's hard to narrow it down. The camera work is great. The closeups are effective, the steadicam shots are tantalizing and the dancing scenes are exquisite. The audience moves and breathes with Portman as the camera weaves and sways with her: graceful and misleadingly innocent amidst the true horror story of mental collapse.The pace drives the film. At times it is slow to mislead the viewer and build the tension, and other times it feels like the film is an out of control car careening toward something we know is there but don't want to see, only to stop short and abruptly and fall back on the delicacy of its innate beauty.Every scene is a marvel, every motion of Natalie Portman's face, every shimmer of her eyes builds upon her character and moves her psyche forward to insanity as the film goes on. But speaking of good acting, let's not forget about Mila Kunis, who is perfectly devious in her aptly named character of ""Lily/ black swan."" I would say Black Swan is a must see, but it isn't for everyone. That being said I still give it probably a 9/10. I've never seen a gorgeous horror movie before.""perfect""",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Black Swan gets under your skin, creeps into your veins, pumps through your heart and sets fire to your imagination.","In Black Swan, Darren Aronofsky creates a nightmarish world that the audience is viscerally thrown into, with continuous twists and surprises at every step of the way, never knowing what will happen next. We only hope there is some salvation at the end. Black Swan is created by one of the most passionate bright young filmmakers alive. The camera style is more regimented and thoughtfully composted compared to the cinema verite, looser, documentary style of The Wrestler. Every shot is perfectly thought out, and the use of mirrors in this film is simply magnificent. The monochromatic colour tone is stunning and at all times the colour palette of everything in shot is tempered to enhance the story. Especially in the wardrobe coloring. The Wrestler was based in the real world, the world we all live in, where a man is grappling with the failures in life, has a daughter, works part-time as a butcher, falls for a stripper and tries to resurrect his fledgling career. It deals with his ego and his determination. Its almost documentary in style. Black Swan is a film sprung from Darren Aronofsky's imagination, aided by a team of talented writers. It is a dark tale of ones inner struggle with perfection. In essence the film centers on the central character of Nina Sayers as she grapples with life as a star ballerina. She does all she can to find perfection within her self and with others. We go into the depths of her mind, and at times the film is as frightening as a Polanski film, at its best. Natalie Portman went on a rigorous training regime for this film and it shows, her performance is mature, dark and stunning. I can continue to write numerous pages on pledging my love for this film but I wont waste my time, or yours, as if you need further information on this, the web is abound with it. When Darren Aronofsky was recently talking about his next film, The Wolverine he made a very interesting point ""I'm just trying to have fun, and for the first time in my life Every single film I've done so far, I've been the only person in the room who wants to make the movie, And I kind of am excited about doing a film (The Wolverine) where actually everyone wants to make it — just to see what the experience is like and see if I can do what I do in that world. It's not like I'm going to change my process. I'm going to be working with the same team and makingreally trying to do something very, very different. In more extensive interviews with Aronofsky he speaks about the struggle for funding Black Swan, as he mentioned in that interview ""Every single film I've done so far, I've been the only person in the room who wants to make the movie"", and it takes brave filmmakers like that to make those great films, that no one wants to make, which are not normal or average. He took a risk, no one wanted to make this crazy film, but the audience has won, we have this film. Once again, this film is not average, it is not formulaic, it is not a normal film. It is unique, stunning and suspenseful in every cinematic sense. It proves that cinema in the hands of giants becomes a canvas for creating beauty, art and entertainment. Black Swan gets under your skin, creeps into your veins, pumps through your heart and sets fire to your imagination.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"This is pretty grand, Guignol","Truthfully, if I had to sit through one more preview of the trailer of this film, I thought I was going to scream. Aronofsky is someone I just don't get, and the deluge of publicity for this film as well as all the award nominations made my heart sink that I would have to man-up and buy a ticket to see ""Black Swan."" The big surprise is this is the most coherent film Aronofsky has managed to make. And good for him! I could finally join the legions who applaud him. I was, however, reminded often of two Polanski films: ""Repulsion"" and ""Rosemary's Baby."" But I won't begrudge the achievement. This is a rip roaring horror film on tippy toes.The heart of the film belongs to Natalie Portman. Just go ahead and give her all the awards. She's magnificent. But so are her costars, Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, Winona Ryder and the incredible Barbara Hershey. But to be honest, I couldn't wait for Mila Kunis to reappear in whatever scene was next, usually precluded with a slamming door; she's absolutely riveting.While the hook here is ballet (and it's all very well accomplished and convincing, which is admirable) this might as well have been a Freddy Krueger film. Quite a few scenes are (were) unwatchable. And the suspense/dread Aronofsky creates earns the price of admission.While I won't say it's the best film of the year, Ms. Portman elevates it to something near that. While it pawns itself off as a study of the stress put on performing artists, it's really just a good scary film. And it's a great job from everyone involved.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Whirlwind film,"Black Swan and Inception are the best films of 2010, but Black Swan stands out as the most stirring film. Portman was marvelous, and the film provides a setting that enthralls the viewer. From the very beginning of the film, reality is constantly in question--in a very pleasing fashion. The mystery of Nina's sanity is well hidden. This film also delivers a well portrayed sexuality while simultaneously depicting a perverse community of dancers. If I could give this film an 11 out of 10, I would. The protagonist's mother is another character that spices up the film. There is always a certain tension between the two characters the causes the viewer constantly expect some sort of violence; the build up in itself becomes almost sexual. I had to laugh out loud at that. I thought this film was well cast, marvelously written, well directed, and incredible to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

'Black Swan' - Obsession Takes Control,"Though it is no masterpiece like Requiem For A Dream in my opinion, Aronofsky has made another good (but not excellent) movie in Black Swan. As I sat next to my buddy, he turned to me and asked, are we in a ballet or something? I couldn't help but laugh as I some would agree with that statement, though I was a little more open minded than my movie counterpart. There was scenes in the film that blew you away (and even made you feel a little uncomfortable), then there were scenes were you would have you saying enough ballet already, when is this scene going to pick up? Regardless of the films ups and downs, it managed to keep you interested for the majority of the film, which is what a good and director film does. There is little reason to believe that Black Swan won't be nominated for Best Picture at this year's Oscars, but in my opinion has a slim chance of actually winning, especially with this year's competition. Now, let's get something straight, I'm not here to rip this film to pieces, I'm just stating that my personal opinion that the film was a little different the most critics. With that being said, it is still a great piece of film making, with great directing, pace, and of course outstanding performances (especially from Natalie Portman).The cast in this movie was nothing short of spectacular. From Natalie Portman all the way down to Wynona Ryder, the acting in this film was extremely well done. Well let's start with the male lead in this role, played by French actor Vincent Cassell (Eastern Promises). Cassell was outstanding as the egotistical, seductive yet brilliant ballet teacher, displaying the characters strong, confident and desirable actions perfectly. The actor was able to make you hate him at times, but also respect him as well depending on the different scenes in the film. Mila Kunis, who is known for more comical roles, didn't disappoint playing Lily (or the Black Swan). Her ability to play nice and gentle, while also competitive and ruthless, really allowed for great character development with the other lead in the film, The Swan Queen herself, Natalie Portman. For those of you who thought Natalie could only play the sweet and gentle type, go out and see Black Swan because in this film she juggles her characters emotions perfectly. At first the actress plays the sweet and gentle Nina Seyers we are all use too, but quickly gets more in touch with her dark side, changing into an obsessed and evil girl immersed in her role as the Swan Queen (which eventually destroys her). The actress does a fantastic job toying with audiences emotions, playing innocent and graceful (as the White Swan) while also being guile and sensuality .The buzz has been roaring for her to receive the Academy Award for best actress, and I can now see why. Her performance was perfect, warranting her an Oscar nomination, and most likely a win.Though the movie could be perceived as horror, i'd like to think of it as more of a dramatic thriller. Aronofsky plays with your emotions so well, sometimes making you sad, while at other times absolutely frightened. His similar directing style to The Wrestler was present throughout this film. His use of playing to the actors back with his camera was done well once again, allowing for the scene to feel more real and suspenseful feel for the audience. His dark style of directing allowed for the film to give off that uneasiness feeling you experience with most thrillers. Even though some would think of this film as a ballet concert, Aronofsky does an excellent job of deflecting that focus with plot twists, lustful/thrilling scenes, and brilliant acting from his talented cast.Black Swan is a movie highlighted by obsession, jealousy, envy, sex and pure lust. It is a film that plays with your emotions, taking you on a roller coaster ride of gentle and moving scenes, to more disturbing and uneasy ones. It is a film that highlights how obsession and immersion of a particular role can lead to the downfall and life of a person who was once so gentle. It makes you think, confused, and intrigued at the same time, with great directing and performances alike. Although critics are raving about this film, I'm going to score it as an A- simply because it is not a movie that everyone will like, and doesn't muster up to Aronofsky's masterpiece, Requiem For A Dream. I will go ahead and say that this film is definitely worth seeing, and will keep you entertained for the majority of the film. For those of you who think they are going to watch a ballet recital, don't, as Aronofsky does an incredible job of shifting the focus of ballet into spooky, thrilling and captivating scenes.

Black Swan (aka Everyone wants to bone Natalie Portman),"Directed by: David Aronofsky Ho-lee crap I don't think I can quite express in words how awesome this movie was. If you need a short version, its absolutely amazing, probably the best movie this year, and shoves all the complexity of a great work of literature into some of the most interesting two hours of film ever.Now then, Black Swan is about the ballet Swan Lake, in which the ballerina who plays The Swan Queen must show both the innocence and virginity of the role of the White Swan, while also playing the opposite role, the lusty and seductive Black Swan. Natalie Portman plays Nina, who is one of the hardest working dancers in her ballet company, who gets picked to play The Swan Queen. The conflict arises when her director, played by Vincent Cassel, tells her that her White Swan is perfect, but that she seems to lack in the role of the Black Swan. This is followed up by the director attempting to unleash Nina's inner Black Swan through means of seducing her, and waiting for her to go and seek her darker persona.Meanwhile, Nina's Mother is over-bearing and highly protective of her, in what ends up being a very psycho kind of obsessive nature. Also, Mila Kunis plays Lily, who is the opposite of Nina, perfect at the Black Swan, but not the ideal White Swan. Nina feels pressure from her director to adapt to the Black Swan, pressure from her Mother to remain the White Swan, and pressure from Lily's presence and the possibility that she will lose her role as Swan Queen to her.All of this is built up over the fact that Nina herself is popping up all over the place with bloody wounds, scratch marks, and in general experiencing a full on mental breakdown, in more ways than one. When it all combines it brings the damn house down.What is really so great about Black Swan is how seamless all of this feels. There isn't a single moment in the film that feels forced. Every aspect of it is set up early and remains as much a part of the film until the very end. The psychological aspect presents itself slower than most, but makes up for it by ruling over the final act of the movie. Furthermore, the pressures that Nina feels are not the pressures of a ballerina that has to play The Swan Queen, they are the pressures that everyone feels, pressures of parents, pressures of playing your role, pressures of competition, all of it applies universally across men and women. Once the movie wraps up it seems to be about breaking everyone's expectations, rising to the challenge, and doing what you want to do.But this aspect also bring out other more challenging aspects of playing a role. Nina is originally seduced largely by her director, what she does subsequently largely has to do with how she is told to adapt to the role. The movie seems to play an underscore about how far do you go to break the expectations? Furthermore, whose expectations are you really playing for? At what point do you stop being yourself and become your role? The complexity of all this is all presented really well, through beautiful dance scenes, and a brilliant classical score. This movie has blood, sex, dance, and art, all mixed up together in a blend that has been seen before, but nowhere near as great as it is presented here.If you like movies, you'll love Black Swan. This is absolutely a must-see!! Go see it now. Now! NOW!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
To become the black swan . . .,"Not many movies do I sit through the credits but this was one of them. I now have a new respect for Natalie Portman whom I never was too impressed by in the past. She was something special in this one.What would you go through to be the best? Nina (Portman) is a very good dancer but according to her teacher, Thomas (Cassel) she is just a one dimensional dancer. If she's going to be the swan princess than she'll have to experience nightmares at their worst.Portman was just wonderful. Her and Mila Kunis spent hours a day for months to get the credibility of appearing as actual dancers and it shows. Portman plays a selfish but motivated girl who is treated like a 12 year old by her mom (Barbara Hershey). Her mom is secretly disappointed by having to end her career for her little girl. Everything is going great for Nina until she meets Lily (Mila Kunis). We all root for Nina even if she is very spoiled.The movie acts almost like a thriller/horror but it's so carefully worked by Darren Aronofsky who doesn't seem to know how to make a bad movie. As the film continues to run, the more you want to know how it ends. This being something that films can't seem to establish nowadays.This movie is special. It is powerful.

"Not exactly one of the best ones, but still a great movie worth-watching!","I never heard of this movie before even though I do heard that it was released last two years ago. Later, we have it now on a DVD copy and my brother watched it. However, he got frightened after the beginning, so he turned it off and I said to myself, ""I think it may not look so bad once I watch it."" and watched the whole movie by myself. I have to admit, I was crying a little bit in the climax and near the end of the film I was so apparently touched by this film. Sure, it's not one of the best movies of that year, but it's still a great film worth-watching to those who have not seen it yet.The only problem that I do have with this movie is that some of the characters would've been given a lot more depth to them with the exception of Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, but that doesn't matter. In fact, the acting is excellent with Natalie Portman doing a fantastic job with her main lead as did Mila Kunis with her meatiest role as the Black Swan. The cinematography and editing is magnificent and the music from Clint Mansell is brilliant (with some nice Tchaikovsky motifs as well), but Darren Aronofsky's solid directing and a compelling, tragic, haunting, and darker story with a great concept about the ballet and a determined girl desperate to achieve a role steal the show.Overall, Black Swan may not be a masterpiece, but it's still a great film, like I said before, to die-hard fans of Natalie Portman & Mila Kunis.

Black Swan is a unique psychological thriller/horror piece about descent into madness, so you get exactly what you should have been expecting.This movie is not about ballet. The critical dance-reviewers of this film remind me of the pretentious weenies who bashed Whiplash because ""it's not true to life, man!"" You mean Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, and the others--who are actors and not actually dancers, by the way--didn't perform the way true ballerinas would? Wow! Thanks for your incredible insight!This movie is not a documentary. ""Pffft. Nina would never be selected to dance this role, because the investors would never allow it in the high-dollar world of professional ballet!"" Oy. It's a story. Suspension of disbelief, people. Going To The Movies 101.And those who grouse about the actual theme--the potential negative consequences of an insatiable drive to achieve--well, I suspect you've never actually achieved anything of true rare value.The movie isn't ""real"" because Nina has no friends? News flash: If you want to be prima ballerina or the next Picasso or Concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra or President of the United States or any other position of prestige, then you have no life outside of striving for the unattainable perfection required to achieve that goal.There are no friends. There are no video games. There is no gardening, or reading for pleasure, or dating, or Saturday afternoon relaxing at Starbucks. In fact, there is no watching of movies like Black Swan. There is only rehearsal and improving your craft. And that life can destroy pretty much anyone. Which is the entire point of this film. Too bad you missed it.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Mediocre as a thriller, good as a drama","This movie is advertised as a horror/thriller but I really see it as more of a drama. The horror/thriller element is there, but it's fairly limited and doesn't really surface until the end of the movie. I think this film is more of a drama. It offers commentary on many serious subjects, including mental health, anxiety, fear, and competition. I think it's also a good insight into how twisted and dark athletic competitions can be, and the disturbing power dynamics involved.Overall, I thought the movie was good, but not as great as people claim. Maybe it's because I watched it in 2024, and there have been much better movies since? Perhaps it was original and exciting for its time. Either way, I think it's worth a watch, but it's not that memorable imo.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Black Swan - 75,"The psychological thriller ""Black Swan"" is another fist hit in the stomach. A flood of discomfort and disturbance in just the right way. An intense horror of the body and its uncontrollability fuels the rhapsodic psychodrama. Its also very artistry. From a visual point of view we are seduced by shadows, light and music in some very engrossing hallucinations. But the whole story set-up isn't overwhelmingly interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Incredibly Effective Sexual-Thriller,"Black Swan (2010)**** (out of 4)Brilliant sexual-thriller about dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) who must put up with her over demanding mother (Barbara Hershey) while at the same time preparing herself for the breakthrough role in Swan Lake. Slowly she begins to lose focus of what's going on due to the director (Vincent Cassel) of the show pushing her too hard and another girl (Mila Kunis) who might want to steal the part. BLACK SWAN, the latest film from Aronofsky, comes as a true tour-de-force and I really can't think of a better structured thriller in the past several decades. I'm sure had Hitchcock himself lived long enough to use the visual medium available today as well as the sexuality that you can get away with today then even he would have been impressed by the end result here. This is an extremely sexually charged movie yet it doesn't contain a single frame of nudity. Aronofsky has pulled off something rather remarkable because the film is like a big puzzle where if one small piece wasn't in the right place then everything around it would just crumble. A lot of credit must go to the director who wants against paints a visual nightmare but also the cast members who are downright eerie in how great they are. What really worked so well here is that you never quite know if what you're seeing is real or not. You enter one reality only to come out in a dream and then possibly continue to be in this dream for the rest of the picture. The way Aronofsky pulls this off is like watching a master working a piano because the director clearly has the audience in his hands and doesn't let them go.As with his previous film THE WRESTLER, it's fair to say that this movie shows what countless others movies had in that it's about jealousy, fear and of course the hard work a professional must do in order to be perfect at their craft. What separates this film is the hellish vision from Aronofsky who uses all sorts of horror elements a lot better than the majority of films that actually try to call themselves a part of that genre. The torments that stalk Nina range from haunting visions to self-mutilation and the pain she feels is easily felt by the viewer. The director keeps the events in the film happening so fast that you can't help but feel like Nina as everything starts to spin out of control and Hell itself finally comes crashing down. The visual look of the film is superb as it ranges from some dark stuff like neo-realism to a beautiful ballet piece at the end. Portman delivers without question the greatest work of her career, which is saying quite a bit as she's always been very reliable no matter what she's doing. The obsession that her character struggles with is beautiful put to film by Portman and you can't help but feel as if you're watching a real dancer and of course someone who really is losing their mind. Hershey will certainly be seen by many as a villain but I loved the way the actress played it. She's not a cold-blooded snake of a villain but instead someone who tries to do good but by trying too hard they become bad. Kunis is so seduction in her part that she's the perfect opposite for Portman and you can't help but believe and feel the two's relationship as the movie goes along. Cassel also turns in a marvelous performance as does Winona Ryder in her small role as the former dancer who is on her way out. BLACK SWAN is a masterpiece of sexual tension and psychological fear. It's a hard film to describe and I'm sure you could show it to a hundred different people and they could all give you a different option of what the film is and what it was trying to do. The film is a real work of art and something that once again proves that Aronofsky is someone to keep an eye on.",,Anonymous,Drama
Very good,"Black Swan concerns the life of Ballerina Nina Sayers, and her quest to be perfect and obtain the coveted lead role of The Black Swan. But there are obstacles in her way, such as an over protective mother, a sleazy director and jealous dancers. Has she got what it takes to carry off this role?First of all Black Swan is not a horror movie. It is more of a dark drama. Many people have gone into this movie with the wrong expectations, believing this to be a gory horror movie. There are plenty of disturbing moments, but these are more psychological in nature.For me this movie had the perfect mix of characterisation, mood and some nice point of view shots. I never knew quite where this movie was heading and this maintained my interest throughout. There has been a lot of care taken with crafting this movie and it shows. Great acting from all concerned, especially Natalie Portman going from naive, insecure girl to decadent vamp. Vincent Cassel is also great as her sleazy director.This is more of an adult thriller and thankfully, there are no annoying teenage characters with clichéd dialog. Catch this in the cinema if you can, as the soundtrack sounds great in surround sound. Recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Masterpiece of Light and Dance,"This film is one of those rare times that the public actually appreciated a true work of art, an inventive story, a brilliant performance, and a story told in a way which only cinema is capable of accomplishing.It feels weird to call Aronofsky a tortured soul because he is a wealthy director of films and has dated hollywood elites repeatedly. Maybe that is part of being a tortured artist? Nothing can resolve the tension you feel inside.Certainly this is the through line of his career. ""Pi,"" ""The Wrestler,"" ""The Fountain,"" ""Noah,"" and ""Mother!,"" all carry within them themes of creation and destruction going hand in hand. ""Black Swan"" is similar in this respect but most similar to ""The Fountain,"" and ""Mother!"" in the way it explores this theme.It is similar to ""The Fountain,"" mainly because of how Aronofsky uses light. Light usually represents life, creation, or artistic expression, not just in Aronofsky but in most filmmaker's work. However, this source of light usually casts a shadow, darkness, and death of some sort. They go hand in hand.In Aronofsky however, while they still go hand in hand, often times it is the darkness which spawns the light. In ""Black Swan,"" This dynamic is shown in that for all her perfection and poise, Nina, played by Natalie Portman (Garden State, Annihilation) who was awarded Best Actress for her role, is uninspiring, hollow, and a disappointment to her company's director Thomas Leroy, played by Vincent Cassel, (Eastern Promises, Ocean's 13).Once she engages with her darker side however, the art flows from her in a whirl of destructive lashing out at her mother, her director, and even the other dancers. In the end, they accept this as her dalliance in the dark has allowed her a brilliant display of beauty previously inaccessible to her. All of this plays out on a dark stage, spotlight desperately trying to keep up.""Black Swan"" is similar to ""Mother!"" in the relationship of Nina to her Director and Lily, the young ingenue who seems to both admire and despise her. Here, the death that leads to creation is submission and shame. In order to find the parts of herself that she must tap into and unleash, Nina must accept and even internalize the criticisms she receives, even those she disagrees with. She must allow herself to be consumed in order to give birth to a new Nina, who can be what the old Nina could not.I know that many may find Aronofsky's way of expressing these things to be too rough, featuring sexual acts may consider taboo and abuse from those in power over her, but for me, I find Aronofsky to be ironically, one of the most redemptive directors working today. His obsession with death turning into life is core to many faiths, and to my own personal beliefs.In ""Black Swan,"" he has outdone himself, partnering with Natalie Portman to achieve one of the most beautiful portrayals of dance, light, and creativity I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
And the Oscar goes to Natalie Portman,"¨It's about a girl who gets turned into a swan and she needs love to break the spell, but her prince falls for the wrong girl, so she kills herself.¨If there is any justice in the world then Natalie Portman should win the Oscar for her leading role as Nina. She has to win; her performance in Black Swan is by far the best of the year. She is just incredible in this film and the transformation her character experiences in order to become the Black Swan is just amazing. I can't think of any other performance from any actress this year that can compare to this one because the entire movie revolves around her. The rest of the characters are all secondary, she is the only lead and star of the film. I just hope Natalie Portman didn't have to go through all the psychological torture that her character had to go through in order to become the black swan. I would've never thought that a film about ballerinas could be so gruesome, raw, and full of psychological and sexual tension. This is the scariest film I've seen this year, and the only person who can pull off a movie like this is Darren Aronofsky. In order to direct a film of this caliber, one has to be completely submersed and passionate about the project, and Aronofsky has always proved he's totally dedicated to his work (Pi, Requiem for a Dream, and The Wrestler were all great and difficult films to make). Black Swan is a different kind of movie and probably will divide audiences because it isn't a film for everyone, but if I have to compare it to any of Aronofsky's previous films I would say it resembles The Wrestler. Mickey Rourke resurrected his career in that film playing a washed up wrestler. He had his glory days, he was passionate about his profession and didn't know how to let go. Natalie Portman plays a ballerina in Black Swan, she's also passionate about her craft and completely dedicated to it. Both of these characters lives revolve around their profession, Mickey is at the exit point of his career, while Natalie is just now trying to make it to the top of hers. As different as these professions may seem, the physical and psychological pressure to succeed is the same.Nina (Portman) is about to get the role of her dreams: Being both the white and the black swan from an adaptation of Tchaikovsky's ballet ¨Swan Lake.¨ She has been working endlessly for an opportunity like this and when director, Thomas (Vincent Cassel), considers her as the new lead she doesn't want to miss her shot. He has decided that it is time to find a new prima ballerina since Beth (Winona Ryder) is getting old and her career is coming to an end. Nina is one of his best and most dedicated dancers. He knows that she would make an excellent white swan due to her perfect form and technique, but she doesn't seem to have what it takes to become the black swan. In order for the transformation to take place, Thomas insists that she loosen up and let her feelings guide her. A new ballerina named Lily (Mila Kunis) shows up and suddenly becomes a threat for Nina because she is so free and confident, everything the black swan should be. Her technique isn't as good as Nina's, but she sees her as a threat nonetheless and at the same time she also becomes fascinated with her. Lily represents everything that Nina has repressed her entire life, she seems to be the opposite of her and that is exactly what she needs in order to become the black swan. Nina begins to lose herself in the role, and the fine line between reality and fantasy becomes blurry.One character I didn't mention in the plot is Nina's mother (played by Barbara Hershey), who is really scary and over controlling. She has definitely played a big role in Nina's life and shaped her character. Nina is a very insecure perfectionist, but she won't let anything stop her from getting the lead role. She begins to push herself so hard into trying to become the black swan that her life begins to get out of control. The entire cast is great in this film, but Portman steals the show. The psychological torture she goes through is perfectly captured by Aronofsky. The score is amazing and plays a huge role in building the suspense and tension as well as the cinematography of the film. Every shot is just perfectly executed. I couldn't help but cringe every time I saw those extreme close ups of the ballerinas feet, of their nails being cut, and so on. If I ever have a daughter it's really going to make me think twice before letting her take ballet classes. Aronofsky has completely changed my perception about ballerinas. Black Swan is a really bizarre, but great film. I recommend seeing it in the theater because the sound and cinematography in this film is just amazing. It's one of those movies in which larger and louder can make a huge difference in the viewing experience. Aronofsky is completely in control of his craft and delivers a terrific film. This is my favorite film of his so far.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Worth the dance but many missteps along the way.,"Mitch Hansch/ movieswithmitch.com Masterful technician Darren Aronofsky follows up his 2008 tortured male athlete film, ""The Wrestler"", with the female counter piece, ""Black Swan"". Aronofsky delves deep into the cut-throat world of ballet with its intensely demanding physicality and harsh office politics. Aronofsky casts Natalie Portman in a sure-fire Oscar nomination as the repressed and insecure dancer who finally gets her shot to shine as lead in the production of ""Swan Lake"". Portman's portrayal of Nina Sayers obsessive strive for perfection that veers into dementia is perfection. I wish I could say the same for Aronofsky's dictatorship..ur.. I mean direction. His overbearing hand frustrated this viewer, keeping me from throwing red roses on stage for ""Black Swan"" instead merely keeping me from throwing rotten tomatoes.Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake tells the story of the white swan princess who when she finds love, is betrayed and in her madness, darkly becomes the black swan. The fragile Nina (Portman) can play white swan no problem but tapping into the black swan is. Stage director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) and his womanizer reputation casts her believing he can get the black swan from her. When the younger care-free dancer Lily, played with a powerful sexuality from an excellent performance by Mila Kunis, comes onto the scene she becomes Nina's alternate and a constant object for Nina's insecurities. As you can see, Aronofsky is quite literal with his story of Swan Lake. Excellent performances aside, ""Black Swan"" isn't as interesting as it seems, simply depending on horror-esquire tactics that jar the senses but are hollow in content.Dance is Nina's life. When asked to introduce herself, she replies ""dancer"" instead of Nina. Her room is pink with stuffed animals and she's still under the thumb of her supremely oppressive stage mother (Barbara Hershey). Nina is buckling under the pressure and slowly begins a path towards madness. Visions of doppelgangers in the subway show influence from Adrian Lyne's ""Jacob Ladder"" and vividly horrifying nightmares of physical trauma blur with reality of what is and is not. A bad habit of scratching resurfaces for Nina that her mother hides with some make-up and a controlling clipping of her nails that's ramped up audibly, keeping you on edge. Early on Thomas explains their version of the swan lake will be stripped down and bare. I wish Aronofsky would have done that with the film. Instead, there is an obsessive-compulsive control over every shot, beating us in the face with his style and not letting Portman's harrowing performance take spotlight as much as it should.Portman is amazing, doing 90% of her own dancing including the spectacular climatic show stopping performance. Aronofsky makes the world of ballet a riveting backdrop which is rarely shown in film. Portman is nakedly intense and brings us along best as she can as she loses herself in Nina's fall but we're manipulated by Aronofsky continually pulling out the horror-laden-madness rug from under us. Her maddening is angering instead of gut wrenching, as it could have been. At the end of Aronofsky's ""Requiem For a Dream"" we feel the characters' complete loss and we're in despair for them but in ""Black Swan"" he wanted the outcome to be tragic yet beautiful, however I didn't feel much of either.Propelled by outstanding performances, none more than Portman's, Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" is a dance worth accepting even if it has several missteps along the way.""This"" has several missteps along the way.﻿John 10:20",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
The performance of a lifetime by Natalie Portman...,"There is a lot to enjoy in Black Swan.The supporting cast, particularly Vincent Cassel and Mila Kunis are terrific. Both give memorable performances and play key roles in the development of the story.Darren Arenofsky ensures lively and creative direction. The ballet sequences are well choreographed, thrusting us right in to the heart of the action.Arenofsky also places a strict emphasis on characterisation, tone and theme. It is these three elements which give the film its superbly dark, tense and claustrophobic feel.But the star of the show is undoubtedly Natalie Portman, as lead ballerina Nina Sayers. There are two main reasons for this:First - Natalie Portman's physical performance. I have heard that Portman underwent 10 months of intensive ballet training for the role. To my 'untrained eye', she expertly captured the beauty and poise of an authentic ballerina. Her competence in this most difficult and uncompromising of art forms is an impressive achievement in itself.Second - Natalie Portman's outstanding character performance. I felt Portman captured every nuance of Nina Sayers' personality to perfection. A young woman's journey through joy, despair, doubt, confusion, jealousy, vulnerability, passion and lust are laid bare for us all to experience. I left the cinema really feeling like I knew Nina Sayers personally.Natalie Portman's performance was undoubtedly the finest I have seen by an actress in a leading role, to date.For that reason, I recommend this unique and compelling film to anyone.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Mad, bad and extraordinary to watch","Black Swan is beautiful, engrossing, crazy, over-the-top, on-the-money, unrelenting, unforgiving, incredible, insidious, ridiculous, brilliant, intoxicating, exhilarating, mad, bad, dangerous and stunning. Not to mention disturbing. And bonkers. It is a film which inspires many adjectives. It may not be everybody's cup of tea, but it is undeniably an incredible experience.It is hard to know where to begin, because the film is so much. It is horror, ballet, psychological thriller, comedy, coming-of-age tale and family drama. Darren Aronofsky hasn't held anything back. This could have been a fairly straightforward character piece, probably starring a second-rate actress which would have garnered her a Best Actress nomination and been middle of the road and solid. But, Aronofsky has taken that and turned it up to eleven.He is helped by the fact that Natalie Portman is much more than a second rate Actress. Here, she truly excels as Nina. Her character is charged with playing two separate roles, and, in a way, so is she, but Portman must bring the White and Black Nina's into one character in the end, recognisable in one moment.This is not a story about a fall into darkness. This is a story about a duality. Nina's sweetness and innocence is unhealthy, particularly in her over-sheltered relationship with her mother, played brilliantly by Barbara Hershey. She is immature more than anything else and has to grow. Of course, this is not a coming-of-age tale through and through. It is about the insanity and pressure of young adulthood, the drive of ambition, the craving of perfection. Portman puts all of this across brilliantly, with great support from Mila Kunis and Vincent Cassell, and a very fine cameo-esque performance from Winona Ryder, who is strikingly convincing as a disturbed woman whose career hasn't gone to plan. I wonder why she got cast for that role though.All of whom remain under the guise of Aronofsky. In this film though he starts it quietly with a girl dreaming and waking up in a quiet, beautiful, princess' bedroom, surrounded by pinks and whites, Aronofsky quickly begins the crescendo of noise, tension and madness which lasts and grows through the whole film. There is no respite. A lot has been made of the lesbian scene between Portman and Kunis. Frankly, at first it's a relief – seemingly a moment of quiet – but Aronofsky is not in the mood for titillation. He is in the mood to drive his audience mad.The whole thing continues to build, knowingly over-the-top and funny with it. Nina's paranoia and hallucinations likewise grow, and, by the end, I had not got the foggiest of what was real and what was not. The ending was baffling, to the extent that it made ""Inception"" look simple. But, I came out and was thrilled and filled with energy. Those who are unsure should go, because even if you don't like it, it's an experience which is well worth having. Besides, the level of craft and acting here is exceptional, and there is entertainment and great fun to be had as well.Four Stars out of Five",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A too simplistic comparison between White and Black/Good and Evil,"Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed Black Swan, but i can't give it a 10 full moon. I rated this movie with 7 stars, that goes to Natalie Portman, who makes a magical job in portraying Nina. She truly deserves an Oscar 2011 for Best Actress. Despite of this wonderful achievement by the gifted Natalie Portman, ""Black Swan"" is too simplistic and too fast. The story is way to modest, compared with amazing special effects and cinema (probably Best Picture 2011...probably, because of ""127 Hours""...). What i'm trying to say is that the plot is too basic. White, Black, Good, Evil, with some great acting, dance and cinematography. The screenplay is good, but nothing memorable. You see, the only elements that resides from Black Swan, for me, as a truly film lover, is Natalie's perfect acting performance, Vincent's deep role and a wonderful cinematography. The rest is just a simple plot, evolving across a ballerina, her dreams, her hallucinations, her mentor, a basic fight, good vs evil and white vs black, on a stage. Nothing more. 7 stars of 10 for Black Swan.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
A beautiful mind!,"A rather accurate depiction of a schizophrenic individual and the brilliance of a distorted brain. The palindrome between reality and fantasy is shown in a playful and at times enigmatic way. The film manages to create a wide range of emotions and subsequently a palette of facial expressions to the viewer; fear as you expect the worse can happen at any time. Admiration of the stamina, endurance and the way she lives her dual life while reaching the top. The viewer can almost empathise and 'ok' the existence of their deepest secret thoughts. The catharsis of the 'swan' leaves a feeling of contentment after the symphony of the emotions. It is as if the whole movie was written with the music in mind and the emotions go up, down; mix up like the notes on a page of a music composition. In one word: Brilliance!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Minority Opinion,"Black Swan (2010), directed by Darren Aronofsky, has an IMDb rank within the 100 highest-scoring films ever made. It's hard to argue with that kind of success, but I wasn't that impressed by the movie.The plot itself is standard ballet fare--beautiful principal dancer, aging dancer being forced to retire, ""friend"" who is anything but, cruel but talented director, smothering mother who never got past the corps in her own career. What else is new?The film alternates between reality and hallucination, and often we can't tell which we're seeing. Serious mental illness is treated as just another part of the tense, competitive ballet world. If you are actively hallucinating, you need medical help. Audience applause won't do it.I think part of the film's critical success is based on Natalie Portman's beauty. The image of Portman in her Black Swan makeup--used for the movie's poster--has already become iconic. Portman is a fine actor. So are Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, and Barbara Hershey. They're all good actors in a good movie. So, Black Swan is worth seeing. However, in my opinion, it shouldn't rank 61st in the list of the greatest movies of all time.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Excellent but not flawless,"This is not the type of film you write a review for in just five minutes, but here it goes - unlike the super realistic The Wrestler, and similarly to Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan starts off ""here and now"", complete - in documentary style, and ends in a vortex of hallucination and CGI. It is an excellent piece of work but not without flaws.Story wise what I missed is a better exposition for Nina and her frigidity. The demanding mother, a ballet dancer who ""could never make it"" and is now burdening her daughter with the task of succeeding where she had failed is the ""mother of all clichés"". The first half of the story, where we are still very much grounded in the ""real"" is overwhelmingly allegorical - the mirrors, reflections, the back and white - are all very much ""in your face"" - no gentle touches, no subtlety.The same goes for the way Thomas is trying to ""open up"" Nina - through her sexuality. Instead of a subtle and slow seduction what we get is a brutal rape, of both Nina and the audience: ""go home and touch yourself"", ""would you f*ck that girl?"" - it felt almost juvenile and achieved the wrong effect.Another major flaw is the repeated use of what we first think to be real but later discover to be an hallucination - again, not only a cheap vehicle but one that is used several times, each time with a diminishing effect. Nina is losing her mind - OK, we get it - but stretch that line too far and you lose the audience too.This is Aronofsky's style and the result is extremely dramatic and powerful, but to me it feels ""cheap""... it is the easier path to drama - not the sophisticated one. The audience laughter at what was meant to be very serious moments is a testament to the failure of Aronofsky to master the art.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Visually exciting and offers real horror, but over-scripted/directed and may seem contrived","First let me start by saying that I didn't like the film much, but didn't dislike it much either. Rating a movie 7 in my benchmark means that I think it's worth watching for many other people, while certain people like me won't like it.While being labeled as a psychological thriller, the film has some horror and fantasy elements, which however, won't be that horrifying for any thriller fan. So it means any average audience is good to go and see this. But as I judge it from my personal view, the film's probably not going to appeal to those who don't like Shutter Island or Muholland Dr. However, it doesn't mean that Black Swan shares the same kind of twist as they do, by which I mean, the story's surely different.The overall feeling that I got from watching this film is that, the director and the script writers put tons of efforts to reflect the main character's psychological inner world. However, it falls flat for some reasons: First, the trick is pretty much a cliché. It's like old wine in a new bottle. The majority of shots telling her psychological responses are a depiction of what she thinks, which don't interact much with and affect the ""real"" outside world or real persons out there, and this brings about little true substance to the movie itself and the idea it tries to express. Second, Black Swan sure has got its emotional content but from time to time it seems to be overdone. Though I don't deny the fact that Natalie Portman delivered a good performance, the acting itself seems rather overdone due to the overdone script. And her switch to the black swan that she's been longing for seems kind of tacked on only for the benefit of offering some visual excitement.While looking it on the bright side, many would love to see the inner spirit of a struggling soul. Black Swan did it deeply with a large amount of dedicated scenes. It'd be good as long as you didn't mind the trick being old. The music and shooting are both great, and the final dance sequence is enjoyable, both technically and artistically. Speaking of this, shooting the sequence could be a real tough job, which the crew handled flawlessly. Also, on the whole, the film has a very dark tone, which gets you glued as long as you are inclined to.If you're looking for an emotional journey that might drive you on, going for the film will never be a wrong choice. But if what you prefer is a clever story with witty twists, or something that's truly trying to EXPLORE rather than SHOW the so-called psychological stuff, you have to have a second thought before going to the cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Nothing more than a bundle of humiliating clichés,"Yes. This movie is disgracefully awful. Sigh.

The Tenant and Suspiria came to mind while watching it too.The cinematography was extremely beautiful, so complex in certain scenes yet so simple in others. The music score was so lovely, I really enjoyed how the composer mixed in elements of Swan Lake and blended it with a modern musical score. Both the cinematography & the music score really deserve nominations too.From the opening scene (which is probably one of best opening scenes I've ever seen) the film draws you in and keeps you in until the ending. I was literally shaking by the time the movie was over. I was that amazed. Darren Aronofsky sure has come quite a way from Pi (that is great movie too), but really every one of his films gets even better after the next. I'm really excited to see what else has to offer. I personally think he's the Stanely Kubrick of our times. (In my opinion) I absolutely loved it. Go see it now. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""I had the craziest dream last night...""","That is the opening line from the new horror film ""Black Swan."" Some of the critics are debating whether ""Black Swan"" is a horror film or a psychological thriller but it is actually both.While is is one of the most hyped movie of the awards season, it is not a movie for everyone. Fanboys are probably going to see it about the much talked about sex scene but that scene only lasts about a minute. About half the film is ballet performance or ballet rehearsing. In that regard it is much like Robert Altman's ""The Company."" If you don't like ballet, you might get bored. But as the film progresses, Nina sacrifices herself for her art and loses her sense of reality and the film turns into a horror movie with the distinctive that only Darren Aronofsky can bring.You can read more detailed plot synopsis in other reviews.

Just.. Amazing,"I don't know if I'm going to be able to put in words my admiration for this movie. Acting was superb. Portman's portrayal as Nina embodies Bullock's role in Blind Side, and I truly believe that it will get her not only an Oscar nomination, but also the win. And Mila Kunis comes out of no where (believe me, I liked her ever since That 70s Show, but this brings her to the upper tiers of actresses to be considered for many significant roles to come) and she deserves the Oscar for supporting actress as well. The movie in entirety is just breathtaking, fascinating, intriguing and suspenseful. Great directing, just a great movie! It kept my entire attention from the first scene to the last, and the last is what really brought this movie to it's height. So much to connect, and a lot of analyze (it's an English major's dream, so I'm in heaven right now). But brava Portman and Kunis. And brava Black Swan. 2010 = Inception & Black Swan as some of the best movies of the year and in decades.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Dark, Twisted, Brilliant","BLACK SWAN follows the story of Nina, a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life is completely consumed with dance. When artistic director Thomas Leroy decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily, who impresses Leroy as well. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side with a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.BLACK SWAN is a dark yet viscerally engaging film that is perfect on almost every level. Director Darren Aronofsky crafts each scene with care and precision. The use of mostly handycams is nothing short of a brilliant decision, bringing in a sense of realism and grittiness which is appropriate for this film. Most importantly, Natalie Portman gives the performance of her career. Like Aronofsky's REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, BLACK SWAN starts off small but slowly builds up to great intensity with a chaotic climax that will leave your jaws dropped.The film manages to sustain an unsettling atmosphere throughout along with hypnotizing you whether you like it or not. The score by Clint Mansell is pretty captivating too. Along with Natalie Portman, the rest of the cast are just as fantastic. Mila Kunis is one of my favorite new stars out there after having seen her in FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL and THE BOOK OF ELI and she gives an effortless performance playing a sexy and slightly dangerous character. Winona Ryder also gives a terrific performance although she's in a brief role. Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey are pretty good as well.While not as depressing and intense as REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, BLACK SWAN is a pretty similar film. With a wildly terrific performance by Portman, an interesting visual palette that your eyes can feast upon, and an unrelenting atmosphere that will put you at the edge of your seats, BLACK SWAN is a twisted yet seductive tale about the dark side of human nature which we can all relate to, as unfortunate as that may sound. BLACK SWAN is really one of the best films of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A masterpiece.,"I am absolutely speechless. I keep trying to formulate words to describe this magnificent film, and I just cannot adequately express it.If you are an artist of almost any performance type, mostly an actor or a dancer, you will relate almost frighteningly closely with this movie. The journey that Nina descends into after being rewarded with the role of the Swan Queen is a journey that any performer who has ever taken on any role that has challenged them can identify with.The explosive climax is one that will be talked about for years to come. No matter what conclusion you come to, there will be someone else that can find a hole in your theory.Vincent Cassell, Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey, and Winona Ryder all deliver nuanced performances that transcend the lines of a supporting performance. They are all absolutely stunning and scene-stealing.However, not a single performance in the film, nor any performance in any film in the past year and possibly the last five years, can overcome what Natalie Portman has achieved. She has completely defined exactly what she portrays in this film: she has completely and totally transformed into Nina, and done so without breaking a sweat. She is mind-altering good. She is perfect. If she doesn't win an Academy Award for this performance, than nothing is right in the world. She is beautiful, sexy, dangerous, and absolutely flawless, and she delivers a performance that is perfect because it is not a performance; it is real.There are surely a thousand more things to say about this film, but as I have stated, I cannot form the words.If you don't see Black Swan, you are missing out on one of the true masterpieces of our generation.

A nightmarish dance,"Black Swan was one of the most anticipated movies of the 2010 Venice Film Festival (which is where I saw it), due to Darren Aronofsky's Golden Lion victory two years earlier for The Wrestler. After its premiere screening, on the opening night no less, it was met with conflicting reactions, ranging from sky-high praise to utter indifference, with some even calling it Aronofsky's worst picture alongside the hugely underrated The Fountain. Were such comments deserved? Absolutely not, but that doesn't mean Black Swan is a masterpiece either. In fact, it is fair to call it Aronofsky's least accomplished piece of work.Set in the very familiar (from Aronofsky's films, that is) contemporary New York, Black Sawn is a dark, psychological thriller about two women: Nina (Natalie Portman) and Lily (Mila Kunis). The former is a young, promising member of a local ballet company, which the latter has recently joined. When company director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) announces his next project is going to be a revival of Swan Lake, he states that Nina is the ideal replacement for former star Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder), who is about to retire due to her age. However, Nina has to prove herself worthy of the double role of the fair and innocent Swan Queen and the deceptive, seductive Black Swan, or she will also be replaced. Fearing Lily might steal her thunder, Nina grows more paranoid by the day, while also tapping into her repressed sexuality to find her inner Black Swan.Despite the alleged ""indie"" tag (the film is distributed by Fox Searchlight, whose parent company previously financed The Fountain), Black Swan is very much a studio effort, with a budget that, while relatively low (13 million dollars), is more than the cost of Pi, Requiem for a Dream and The Wrestler put together (The Fountain, on the other hand, remains Aronofsky's priciest picture). In fact, comparisons with The Wrestler - the director himself has said the two movies are companion pieces - highlight where Black Swan derails: whereas the Mickey Rourke-starring drama was a truly independent film, not to mention Aronofsky's best (and in no small measure because of his decision to let go of his usual directorial tricks), the ballet thriller is a compromise between a studio product - evident in the classic theme, akin to All About Eve, and the cast - and the filmmaker's personal vision, which reverts to Requiem for a Dream sensibilities for a story he didn't write himself.Not that it's necessarily a bad thing: in its most inspired moments, Black Swan is an exquisite picture, pulsating with life and filled with indelible, nightmarish images that showcase the heroine's gradual descent into madness, all coordinated with beautiful choreography and impeccable musical cues. Unfortunately, the second half proves to be too weird for its own good, with a shift in tone that aims for visceral horror - think Polanski mixed with early Cronenberg - but gets caught up in some decidedly embarrassing moments, most notably the bulk of scenes involving a hammy Barbara Hershey as Nina's overbearing mother.And yet it holds up until the end, and not just thanks to a lesbian sex scene that is bound to become a guilty pleasure lynch-pin. While the director's idiosyncrasies may get out of hand, his cast is fully committed and delivers solid work throughout (well, minus Hershey): Cassel is as enjoyably nasty as ever, and Kunis, who unexpectedly won the Mastroianni Award in Venice, finally sheds off the memory of Max Payne and American Psycho 2 and establishes herself as a promising dramatic actress. As for Portman, her schizophrenic role is one of the bravest she's ever tackled, and she remains a majestic, compelling presence for the duration of the movie, while Ryder nearly manages to steal her thunder with just a handful of scenes that ring scarily true: being herself in her late thirties during the shoot, the actress knows all too well what it's like to risk becoming a has-been, and gives an angry, unforgettable performance that should get her an Oscar.Black Swan is a dazzling, spellbinding and frustrating picture. Tonally uneven and occasionally self-indulgent, it nevertheless manages to seduce and intrigue and, at its best, reminds us that Aronofsky is one of the most original and visionary names in contemporary American cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Pop Corn and Art,"This movie reminds me on how one average American imagines art. Probably the same way that the whale imagines how is it to fly as an eagle. This movie is a cheap insult for Chaikovsky. Pulling up the standard prosaic and narrow film ideas to imply art, Hollywood brings this time one more dull and unimaginative film work. Black Swan has no film pattern at all. No film rhythm. No film plot. And no art sparkles at all. It is the same tense in the beginning as at the end. Or is the life of pro ballet player with difficulties she is facing a film plot just because Chaikovsky is involved? Poor Chaikovsky could not melt in this tele novela mish-mash of sex and twist, love and hate. Did I say that this is definitely the worst movie of Vincent Cassel? And above all Mr director, even if you latently tried to film the Swan Lake you should be aware of the fact that film and ballet are two different art categories. Did you say 8.6 grade???

If I dreamt a nightmare like ""Black Swan"", I would be quite sure that my subconscious and Auschwitz memories did it again to me.I am a grown man now. Seen lots of things. Now I've seen a film which main point is hurt, at least to those vulnerable. The CGI and formula has destroyed whatever artistically beautiful was meant to be in it.

Frightening look inside the artist's psyche,"""Black Swan"" is an excruciatingly intense psychological thriller that evokes disturbing questions of identity and the dangerous lengths to which a performer (in this case, a ballerina) will go in order to nail a role. Natalie Portman is painfully good as Nina Sayers, an up-and-coming ballerina who finally gets an opportunity to dance the role of the Swan Queen in a production of ""Swan Lake."" But can she abandon her perfectionism (which suits her well as she dances the technically demanding role of the white swan) and embrace the wild passion required to dance the role of the black swan? As she attempts to master these dual demands, her psyche begins to unravel. She battles a demanding, controlling mother (played with calm menace by Barbara Hershey), a brutally harsh director (Victor Cassel), a provocative, carefree rival (Mila Kunis), and ultimately her own doubts, fears, and violent misgivings about her ability to be ""perfect"" in both roles. This is the role of Portman's career, and I fully expect her to garner an Oscar nomination, along with Darren Aronofsky's directing and the film itself for Best Picture. ""Black Swan"" is mesmerizing and enthralling.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
White Jekyll to Black Hyde,"BLACK SWAN is a clinical examination of psychosis vs borderline personality dichotomy and as such it succeeds well. It is not unusual for director Darren Aronofsky to plunge into controversial subject matter ('Requiem for a Dream', 'The Wrestler', 'Pi', 'The Fountain') but his mastery of a new zone of cinematic investigation of mental illness based on a story by Andrés Heinz who also wrote the screenplay with Mark Heyman and John McLaughlin is his most daring work yet. BLACK SWAN is as disturbing a film to watch as it is a richly rewarding testament to storytelling based on age-old themes.The setting is a ballet company preparing a new version of the familiar Petipa and Ivanov choreography of the ballet Swan Lake, a story based on Russian folktales about a young girl transformed into a white swan ('Odette') and the darker malevolent black swan ('Odile') who under spells from the evil Rothbart vie for the love of Prince Siegfried. The choreographer Thomas (Vincent Cassel) must retire the reigning white swan queen (Winona Ryder) because of her age and has tryouts for a new swan queen. The shy, introverted, frightened but excellent dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) seems perfect for Thomas' new concept of the white swan, but she lacks the visceral and sensual passion for the extension of the role as the black swan. Nina is the daughter of a frustrated ex-ballerina Erica Sayers (Barbara Hershey) who gave birth to Nina and missed out on becoming a prima ballerina. Erica is controlling and forces Nina into rigorous training and discipline so that Nina will become the star Erica failed to realize. Nina devotes her life to ballet, participates in behaviors such as self mutilation that suggest she is an unstable personality. Thomas continues to attempt to bring out Nina's passionate personality but the attempts become Nina's obsessive delusions regarding her fear of being unable to be perfect: she imagines all manner of events and body changes, finding that her only friend Lily (Mila Kunis) leads her into an even more distorted lifestyle - or does she... The manner in which Nina transforms herself into the black swan is breathtaking and the climax of the film leaves the audience wondering about the real ending versus another version of Nina's broken mind.The cast is excellent, with Natalie Portman (who trained into her own balletic role so that she could perform Odette/Odile credibly) delivering a brilliant performance as the fragile, vulnerable, mentally disturbed Nina. Her partner in the ballet, David, dancing the role of the Prince, is Benjamin Millepied - a remarkably magnetic actor/dancer with whom Portman is now engaged and pregnant. Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey raise their characters to an even higher level than the script - wholly and terrifyingly credible. At times Aronofsky could have used some restraint in showing the repeated delusions of Nina's broken mind and the impact would have been a bit more subtle. Mathew Libatique provides elegant cinematography and Clint Mansell reinterprets the Tchaikovsky score - sometimes it works, other times it is maddenly warped: the most successful plagiarism is in the piano-only reduction during the credits. But the overall impact at film's end is a stunning work and a tribute to the talent of Natalie Portman.Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Wonderful,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, in terms of messages it sends and way it's made. Cast in brilliant (especially) Natalie Portman. I cry every single time in the end of this movie (and I've watched it more then 10 times...)",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Dancing with the Stars,"I just got back from watching ""The Black Swan"" and am still sorting out my feelings about it. Most of the way, it was borderline unwatchable, mostly about people mutilating themselves mentally and physically. Then it got very dramatic but kind of over the top with a seeming triumph but by that time you don't know what was real and what wasn't: you don't know whether to be ""uplifted"" or not. It has some of my favorite actresses in it- Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder, Barbara Hershey and Mila Kunis, who I'd only seen in the lightweight ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and ""Date Night"", (both of which were a lot more fun to watch than this). All gave terrific performances. Portman, who was also great as Anne Boleyn in ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", has matured into a major actress. But Hershey is probably the best thing in the movie as the loving but somehow threatening mother. Kunis gives the film the only charm it has and hits all the right notes in her limited but important role. Ryder's appearance made me sad because a decade ago she might have played Portman's role, (although she doesn't really have a ballet dancer's body). Her career never really recovered from her shop-lifting arrest, although she's made some interesting smaller films. I may be interpreting this wrong but I'm not alone, (judging from the IMDb) in seeing her role as the aging ballerina being angrily ""retired"" as paralleling her own career. Comparisons are being made to prior films- one that keeps cropping up is ""Showgirls"", another movie that may not be as ""good"" as this one but was more fun to watch. Some are comparing it to the same director's ""Requiem for a Dream"", about people who are falling apart due to drug use, (and who also lose touch with reality, as does the audience,). That was another unpleasant one. Id have to say that this is a movie you should see if you want to make sure you have an opinion about who should have won which award.

It was almost as if we (the viewer) had become this character. We felt and experienced her fear and paranoia; sanity was questionable as you would lose yourself watching this masterpiece of a film.Without giving the plot away, let me just say the film was beautifully done.

Everything about it was immersive, and as the story progresses you can't help but become a part of the Black Swan experience.Trust me, there will be many second viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Aronofsky dabbles in mirrors, triplicates and the doppelgänger effect.","Black Swan is directed by Darren Aronofsky and co-written by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz & John McLaughlin. It stars Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey & Winona Ryder. Clint Mansell scores the music and Matthew Libatique is the cinematographer.Nina Sayers (Portman) is committed to her art as a ballet dancer, she lives a secular life with her over protective mother (Hershey), herself a one time dancer. When Nina's ballet company announce that a production of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake is seeking a new prima to play the Swan Queen, Nina pushes herself still further to land the role. But with the role comes more pressures. Her instructor, Thomas (Cassell) urges her to explore darker passions within so as to nail the Black Swan part of the role, her mother becomes even more over-bearing and a new arrival to the production, Lily (Kunis), pushes her fragile state of mind to the limit. Perhaps more worrying is that Nina appears to have a doppelgänger lurking within her enclosed world.Black Swan, once the dust has settled, will prove to be a most divisive film. More so when under the scrutiny of a repeat viewing. How it holds up after the exhilaration of that first viewing has faded will be most interesting to observe. For Black Swan ""is"" at times ""exhilarating"", brilliantly performed by its cast principals, and in Aronofsky's hands it's directed with a hand-held panache befitting one of America's most talented directors: but is it the sum of its parts? Aronofsky has been quick to let people know that he views Black Swan as the sibling to The Wrestler, and fact is is that he reworks a lot of that film's particular aspects into this Swan Lake skin itcher; only now he's cloaking his subject in the darker side of the human mental condition. So if it isn't broke, don't fix it then. Be it the back drops (dim and raw), specialist entertainment professions or the suffering for their art central characters, Aronofsky clearly isn't pushing for a career reinvention here. However, he ups his ante visually and shows himself to be a dab hand at psychological horror. Other critics have name checked the likes of Polanski, De Palma and Cronenberg, those are all fair comparisons, and in the grand scheme of things, enormous pats on the back for Aronofsky.He is also a director able to get career defining performances out of his charges, many have been quick to remember Mickey Rourke's much lauded turn as The Wrestler, lets not forget the performance he garnered out of Ellen Burstyn in Requiem for a Dream, too. Portman, tho, tops both considerably, pushing herself, like her character, to the limit for the role; with her director now on record after Portman's win for Best Actress at the BAFTA's as saying she's the best actress he has worked with thus far. Both Portman and Kunis undertook months of ballet training to put some reality into the film, with Portman gaining praise for her dancing in ballet circles. But from here is where the problems in the film begin to unravel. Ballet dancers we know are driven, it's a tough form of the arts, but in some quarters of the medium the film has been criticised for portraying the dancers negatively, and for over exaggerating their lives. It's a good point, because my lady partner who I first watched the film with felt that Nina comes across as a whiney whinger, and she is right. Nina as a character is hard to feel any sympathy for. This is more evidently annoying upon a second viewing, so much so it's debatable if you will even care about Nina once the applause has died down at the finale. Great performance, but written as unsympathetic or otherwise? Eh?Another issue is the matter of sense, or the not making of to be exact. Many greats behind the camera have thrived on producing head scratchers, complex pieces designed to nag away at you as you try to sleep. The narrative here doesn't suggest anything complex, yet incidents don't add up, with one critical incident rendering the finale as questionable. It's also awash with clichés, but the crafty Aronofsky is able to mask such issues with smoke and mirror tactics, calling on his skills to avert the eyes with enjoyable visual flourishes that are essential to the tonal flow of his film. Technically all is wonderful and at times rawly lurid, sweeping cameras getting up close and personal, the music, the choreography and the grandiose sets, all impact hard on the viewing experience. While the film's blending of themes opens it up to a wider demographic audience; even if ultimately it's caught in the void between camp horror and serious psychological drama. Away from Portman the support is also crowd pleasing, Kunis is sly and slinky, Cassell is Mephistophelian and Hershey reminds us all that she can act.It's sure to be a the top of many critics best of lists for 2010/2011, partly for being not of the norm and asking for use of the cranium: and partly because director and lead actors make it compulsive viewing. While it's sure to engage fans of dance and classical music. But after taking off the tutu and slippers, and unwinding with a glass of wine, it shows itself to be a film that's far from flawless, and certainly not the masterpiece that already some insist the film to be. Maybe it should be watched just once and not pored over to truly get the benefit? Maybe? 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Black Turkey,"Ah!Another artsy-farty film about an artsy-fartsy subject made for the artsy-fartsy crowd....TBS is a tedious, stagnant and derivative film that goes absolutely nowhere.Well, one wonders, what can be as exciting as the backstage story of a young lady competing to be the prima ballerina in a new production of The Black Swan? Not much really, because under normal circumstances there is nothing going on in this type of environment, unless one is interested in underweight, monomaniac girls with inflated egos whose main objective in life consists of perfecting the vacuosity of dancing...On top of that, TBS is a film whose characters (without exception) are despicable. The main character, Nina, for instance, could easily be described as a pathetic, anorexic, obsessive and psychologically weak young lady. Her mother is an abusive, bitter, has-been type of person. Nina's friend (if we may call her that...)is a dancer who smokes(a clear sign of the presence of the tobacco lobby in action) and do drugs, the choreographer, of course, is a sex addict that preys on the vulnerability of his young dancers, and the rest of the them, which are the other dancers, seem to be poised to stab each and everyone in the back so that they can get the most coveted part in the production. They are all very inspiring, I guess.The end of TBS, of course, is very cliché (as is the whole film...) because, as expected, what matters in the end is the performance, the perfection of execution and all that stupid bla-bla-bla about winning and succeeding at any cost.To spike the interest in and keep the attention of the male audience watching this ""masterpiece"" , the producers resorted to an old trick and introduced two gratuitous sex scenes (one of them depicting lesbian sex) in the film.So, in the end we have a film with unpleasant characters, a weak script, and a story which could have been told in 15 minutes.Well, it seems ""Black Swan"" is the perfect Oscar contender...",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

This is what everybody loves to see!,"Talking about such a film seems to be tough as some scenes are too fast to be understood and it's needed to be watched at least 2 times. Darren Aronofsky who ignored ""127 hours"" to direct ""Black Swan"" shows great ability to take watcher's focus and involve them in the story. Not a moment I paused the film but I only did when I was scared what will happen next.Story: Nina Sayers is a young ballerina who tries to be chosen as ""Swan Queen"" in ""Swan Lake"" ballet. Vincent Cassel, the group's coach, recognizes Nina to be perfect for ""White Swan"" but so much weak for ""Black Swan"".Her demand to get the role adds more stress on pressure from her mother, a former ballerina. She got all the control over Nina and acts like a baby with her, wanting Nina to achieve all she couldn't in her professional life time.Nina's effort for playing Black Swan as well as White Swan didn't come conclusion except when she began to get more in touch with her dark side, as far as Black Swan indicates guile and sensuality but White Swan represents innocence and grace. This turning point starts hallucinations and changes Nina in a weird wayDetails: focusing on the details for the second or third time watching this movie helps finding out that even everybody's clothes color has been chosen for a reason. In bar Nina wearing white and Lily black is a sign of their position in the world and their completely different personalities.Sound editing: in most of the films cinematography is the main way to influence the audience. However in ""Black Swan"" sound editing does the job. Nina's toes piping all the film long when dancing or massaging is so much real that you will have to get all parts of your face together to decrease the pressure. The moments of silence right in the middle of ferment takes you right inside of brain of actress to feel what she really feels.Actors & Actresses:Natalie Portman: having a hard job combining emotions with ballet was the main reason she got every reward possible. Her innocent face goes straight into your mind and reinforces you sympathy from the first scene. Great job! Vincent Cassel: carrying years of experience helps him to fit himself into the role. This special face which makes him attractive in some cases has specific effect on watcher that indicates a negative role just opposite of what he is.Mila Kunis: after ""Book of Eli"" pretty Mila Kunis seems to become a celebrity who just knows what to do. Admirable play of her keeps the observer's negative look on her till the last scene.Darren Aronofsky: Absolutely my favorite as far as I explained about actors.

The direction here is truly beautiful, though in full colour it feels at time that it could be in monochrome, it truly gives a seediness to the world its presented here.Despite being a film based upon ballet, it is more character driven that anything else, though the main premise of the film might be put off by Black Swan this would be truly stupid thing as it really is good enough to appeal to a broad range of people.Though it is Natalie Portman that leads this film with guns a blazing, other significant women in this film stick out.

The film's subject matter of a woman's fears causing her to descend into a state of paranoia, as well as Darren Aronofsky's direction are both clearly influenced by Roman Polanski's 1960's psychological thrillers ""Repulsion"" and ""Rosemary's Baby."" However, while ""Black Swan"" is also primarily a character study of a female protagonist's deteriorating mental state, the faster pace and more melodramatic dialogue makes ""Black Swan"" a more commercial film. That isn't to say that ""Black Swan"" is a lesser film, because I think it just about as good as Polanski's classics, and possibly deals with more relevant themes. It's simply that the style will probably not shock the audience as much as Polanski's.Having said that, I consider ""Black Swan"" a perfect film. The story follows Nina, a young ballerina (Natalie Portman), who gets her dream role of the Swan Queen only to find herself becoming paranoid of losing the role to her double (Mila Kunis), as she is pushed to the extremes by her director (Vincent Cassel) to ""let go"" of her obsession with technical perfection in order to become the darker side of her role: namely, The Black Swan. The way Nina begins to embody her role of The Black Swan, while being paranoid of losing her dream part, is what constitutes the ""horror"" of the film. It also builds up to an operatic climax that wraps up the film beautifully. Aronofsky's direction brilliantly captures Nina's paranoia, making for a hallucinatory viewing experience, and the musical choices elegantly complement the great camera-work and choreography. It's a beautiful and thrilling film, although I did not find it particularly scary.The performances here are excellent. Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, and Barbara Hershey (as Nina's overprotective mother) all put in convincing displays in their supporting roles. Nevertheless, the true star of the show is undoubtedly Natalie Portman. Doing the majority of her dancing scenes without a double, Portman delivers a virtuoso performance that demonstrates the full spectrum of her acting ability from the subtle, nervous glances she gives to the tears of heartbreak and torment.Artful, thrilling, and powerful, ""Black Swan"" is a technically perfect film. Ironically, however, ""Black Swan"" might just suffer from the same problem as its main character, in cementing itself as a classic: it is so perfect that it fails to deliver the final punch by letting everything go.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Black Swan,I love this movie with all my heart. It is my all-time favorite film.,,Anonymous,Drama
freakishness + awesomeness!,"I saw Darren Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream"" last year and fell in love with the director (no! i am straight). I have always had hopes from this guy. But this movie that I saw today didn't just live up to my expectations, in fact it exceeded way above it! I have a whole new level of respect and appreciation for this amazing director. The movie ""Black Swan"" is another masterpiece added to Darren's collection of dark psycho thrillers. The movie is about a ballet dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) who has been selected for the upcoming ballet performance ""Black Swan"". Actually she replaces the former dancer Beth(Winona Ryder) because of her age. Overwhelmed and delighted Nina starts practicing for the day. The rest is a journey through her life as she faces the various hurdles for getting chosen for the Swan ( the main character of the ballet)and her relationship with people around her including the ballet director Thomas Leroy(Vincent Cassel). There's another dancer Lily (Mila Kunis) who is competing with her for the role.The only thing that I want to add without spoiling the suspense is that Nina is a die hard perfectionist and crosses all boundaries to perfect her character.Okay, thats all i can reveal right now. But TRUST me there's a mighty lot more to the story. I have so much to talk about this movie. Darren has continued with his style of direction with graphic and vivid repetitive sequences. I felt so much of the dark and depressive ambiance generated in the movie. And like always even Black Swan doesn't fail to leave a painful clog in the throat by the end of it. Lets take up each aspect one by one. First the acting. I HAVE to say, after the direction the next brightest jewel in the crown is Natalie Portman herself. She undoubtedly is one of the most gorgeous women in Hollywood and my all time favorite (since Star Wars itself). But not just an eye pleaser she is, an equally terrific acting in the movie displays the immense talent she has within her. The sequences with Nina's mother, the ballet director, Lily, Beth every little and noticeable piece of acting by her is just flawless. In fact it seems Natalie, just like her character Nina has some perfection in her. The grace and elegance that she carries in the movie is incredible. so thats a thumbs up for Natalie. Next is the overall ambiance and mood. DUDE, how in the name of god do you do it? This movie is a total psycho freak show with scary,brain squeezing sequences,depressing scenes and beautiful dancing. There are seemingly random and haphazard scenes, but even within this chaos lies a serene order in the storyline that makes complete sense. This piece of art demands a huge amount of maturity and understanding for you to be able to appreciate it. In fact this is the only possible con i can think of. Some of you might find it notoriously tough to get it in the head (and for the others to get it out). So I highly recommend the movie for the people of the second kind. Saddening but very enjoyable movie ""Black Swan"" has made it to my list of best 10 movies seen. Not better than Requiem but a fairly close rival. The movie also has a message in it ( which depends upon the viewer to decipher). Okay i guess thats pretty much it. Go watch it you wont regret !!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Artifice will always be exposed as something artificial,"Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) is casting for the lead in his new version of 'Swan Lake' and is captivated by the grace, control and pulchritude of Nina Sayers' dancing. Nina (Natalie Portman) is a gifted ballerina, but has become so through a life of submission to her controlling mother (Barbara Hershey).We're never clear who's manipulating who in Darren Aranofsky's warped psychological thriller. Leroy has a lecherous side and will say anything to bed any of the girls he's supposed to be training. Lily (Mila Kunis), Nina's main rival, is also desperate for the lead part and will stop at nothing to overthrow Nina. Or is Nina manipulating herself? Has the unattainable goal of perfection she – or rather her mother – inculcated in her impaired her psyche? Nothing is as it seems. Or is it?Beauty might be the effect of ballet, but the process to get to that beauty is shown to be ugly. The film's technicians did much to establish the distinctive look. Colour has been drained, leaving only shades of black, white and grey to saturate everything: a stylistic device, I suspect, to reinforce the White Swan/Black Swan – good vs. evil – metaphor. Attention has obviously been paid to choreography, but it would have made sense to show more of what Portman had learned. Artifice will always be exposed as something artificial.I don't know what it says about me but I am drawn to artists who suffer for their art. Portman trained for a year and lost weight (20 pounds) to obtain a lissom body. She suffered an array of injuries, including a severe concussion and a twisted rib.The biggest injury she sustained was the temporary absence of her renowned acting ability. The horror element in the story did something to overshadow her performance. Indeed I'd suggest that the film's success or failure depends on whether the White Swan/Black Swan metaphor is engaging enough.Sean Penn once said of ballet that you didn't have to like it in order to appreciate it. That's sort of my feeling about this film.www.scottishreview.net",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"If this were my Black Swan, I'd have it put down","A great cast put in great performances in a flawed and ultimately pointless film.MINOR SPOILERS ahead.Suspension of disbelief is a requirement of the movies, but you can't suspend your disbelief when it relates to the core of the central character. This film purports to be a descent into madness, but Nina (Natalie Portman in fine form) is clearly nuts right from the beginning, inherited from a mother (Barbara Hershey) who makes you think of the shower in the Bates Motel.So the madness elevator has clearly hit the sub-basement sometime before the opening credits. And this is where the disbelief sets in: someone so clearly a pork pie short of a picnic simply would not get to play the prima donna role. Others have pointed out that any main role in Swan Lake will be danced by two or three dancers rather than one headlined figure, so the premise of competition driving Natalie nuts goes out of the window as well.And the movie is, frankly, vulgar: everything is telegraphed in an obvious and clumsy way. No intellectual input is required from the audience - everything is spoonfed one morsel at a time. For example, Mia Kunis (who is the best thing in this) has black wings tattooed on her back - subtle? Maybe not. And when Nina finally gets in touch with her dark side, her eyes go yellow (like Michael Jackson in 'Thriller' - which featured more expressive dancing).The sex scenes are unnecessary - they add nothing to the film because, although having an orgasm is supposed to give Nina a brilliance that has thus far eluded her in dancing the seductive Black Swan role, we do not see any difference.There are horror elements which aren't scary because you know they aren't real (did I mention Nina is nuts from day one?), and visceral moments in the film that are just stomach-churningly unpleasant to anyone not raised on torture-porn.The climax is so unlikely as to be laughable.Overall a sad waste of talent.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Obsession, beauty, desire and longing","It's a film about obsession, about beauty, about desire and longing, and about jealousy. It will force a range of emotions upon you, from stark fear to arousal, and it has a soundtrack that will move you to tears. In all honesty, it wouldn't be amiss to declare that Black Swan is a perfect creation of cinema - a masterpiece.Black Swan is essentially a modern retelling of the plot of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake and it's utterly exhilarating. Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayers, a ballet dancer in a New York City ballet company who, after years of trying, has finally scored the lead role of The Swan Queen in their upcoming production of Swan Lake. However, it's a precise role, requiring dual characteristics, both that of the Black Swan and the White Swan, and ballet director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) isn't convinced that she's capable of exhibiting the right flare. Meanwhile, fellow dancer, newcomer Lily (Mila Kunis) seems to effortlessly portray the Black Swan, and Lily starts to fear that the girl is after her part.Nina, whose character and personality is being repressed by her dominating mother, struggles to find some independence and adopt the free will and spirit of the Black Swan, and she initially befriends Lily, believing that her reckless lifestyle could inspire the freedom she needs for the role. However, it's not long before Lily seems more of a foe than a friend, and Nina's not sure she can control the dark side of herself that she is toying with.Director Darren Aronofsky is famed for his explorative, and imaginative cinematography and Black Swan is a perfect example of this. There are numerous shots throughout that would be worth pausing and just enjoying as still photographs. This combined with intriguing set designs and astoundingly beautiful costumes (designed by Amy Westcott) make Black Swan a visual feast.Both Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis give career defining performances, particularly Portman, whose acting is surely worthy of Oscar attention, and as little as I know about ballet, it seemed to me they were both spectacular dancers too - certainly they move with a confidence and elegance that charm the viewer.It would be unfair to neglect to mention Clint Mansell's superb score that underlies the entire movie. It is heavily drawn from Tchaikovsky's original music, but whilst that deems it ineligible for Oscar attention, it makes for a dramatic, majestic and emotional score, the likes of which hasn't really been used with film before. It's as if the 19th Century composer himself wrote the music.In terms of genre, Black Swan occupies a definite grey area. In many ways it could be considered a horror. It's very frightening at times, predominantly due to suspense rather than constant visual shocks, and the shadowy, dark colour palette is especially foreboding. However, it perhaps functions more as a psychological thriller - what you see is rarely what is happening, the ballet director seems to be the architect of some dangerous mind games, and is Nina losing her mind? Undoubtedly there is much more method to the madness than might first appear and it's this magic of uncertainty and paranoia that will keep you spellbound through to the tragic, heart wrenching climax.This is a triumph of film making and one to watch again and again. Definitely worth watching at the cinema.",,Anonymous,Drama
It was about some of us...,"""It was perfect""
Here you can really write a lot and a lot about almost everything, but I'll start with the fact that this film will seem like a touch of schizophrenia to an ordinary viewer, but for people with an ""obsession"" with any business, art, sports, this is a true story. I won't lie if I say that many felt the same as the main character. Yes, not so exaggerated of course, but it was. I read a lot of reviews where they mentioned how beautifully crazy is shown, I agree that visually this is a masterpiece. Costumes, makeup, lighting, entourage, camera work and directing - everything deserves a standing ovation and respect. However, this is not crazy, this is an illusion that you plunge into if your obsession becomes you.This film is about how deep you can dive into your passion and how dark it can be. This is a very subtle psychological thriller in which few can see themselves. Natalie Portman naturally lived this role perfectly, she did not play, she felt.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Average film carried by a good actress,"I didn't know what to expect going into Black Swan, which is always the best way to view a new film. From the opening scenes, I was expecting an emotional, paranoid thriller. In reality, it was more of a mediocre cross between Jacob's Ladder and The Red Shoes.The film tries so hard to be shocking and raw that it quickly becomes irritating. There are two rather vulgar (and ultimately unnecessary) sexual scenes that where screaming so hard for attention you can almost hear Megan Fox in the background wondering why she wasn't cast for the role of Nina. The rest of the cast are so cardboard and cliché they aren't even worth a mention. The story is predictable from the first 10 minutes if you know the ending to Swan Lake and has as much intrigue as a dead dog in a skip.At time of writing, it has already won a golden globe (Portman, best actress) and has been nominated for similar awards at the Oscars. I find it quite annoying that the cardboard cutout of a film behind the lead actress is completely ignored because Natalie Portman acted well. If this had a lesser female lead, it would have been bargain bin material and forgotten about within a few years. Completely and utterly carried by the beautiful Natalie Portman.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Perfection,"After the awesome Requiem for a Dream (also one of my all time favourites) he had a small misstep with the somewhat obscure, ""The Fountain"" but is most certainly back on his a-game here with Black Swan.

Portmans performance deserves every accolade that it receives and Barbara Hershey and Mila Kunis also deserve special mention.The editing, the pace, the score, everything this film has on display has been so meticulously crafted that it defies explanation.This is undoubtedly the most beautifully crafted horror film I have ever seen. Deeply disturbing with thematic elements that can be discussed ad nauseum post-film.

Not Bad but Clichéd,"A fragile dancer lands the lead role in ""Swan Lake,"" but struggles to meet the expectations of the ballet director.

Unfortunately the film is full of clichés: the boss demanding sexual favors (Cassel), the has-been star (Ryder), the manipulative understudy (Kunis), the stage mother (Hershey). The depiction of Portman's psychological descent from White Swan to Black Swan is simplistic and some of the scenes are gratuitously graphic. The dance scenes are well done, helped by Tchaikovky's great score.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""It's MY turn!""","Natalie Portman adequately plays Nina, a slightly over-the-hill ballerina who's subject to hallucinations and self-mutilation, not to mention jealous cohorts, a perverted exploitative slimeball dance director, and a creepy overbearing mother who's a retired ballerina herself. Her primary nemesis--besides, perhaps, herself?--is Lily, a rival fellow dancer and eerie younger lookalike well-played by Mila Kunis.I really tried to like BLACK SWAN. Its whole plot and set-up is something nicely different, and it at least begins to allow us some empathy with a victim of SIB, raising (however briefly) interesting questions regarding victim-victimizer relationships. The whole premise of how ballet imitates life and vice versa and how all the major players here are also dancers in life's suite has a lot of potential; unfortunately, it just doesn't play out as well as it could and probably won't mean that much to the average viewer. This film also constantly tries for scary and suspenseful, but the effect is just silly.This might have worked better as a more conventional drama (keeping the symbolic roles) about the cutthroat competition and jealousies that take place between dancers who try to sabotage each others' careers and performances. It also would have helped immensely if the symphonic soundtrack had been saved for the dance performances and not pervaded the bar scenes, Nina's apartment, and everywhere else.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Sublime. Sensual. Sinister. Superb.,"""Black Swan"" opens with Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) performing as the White Swan, as the triumphant orchestra bellows behind her while the camera rotates around her frantically, to capture her elegance and grace. Minutes later, she awakens from her dream. She goes to a ballet academy in New York City to try out for the play ""The Black Swan"", and hopefully win the lead part of the White Swan, but doing so also means that she will have to play the part of the Black Swan as well, the White Swan's evil twin.Such is the case in the latest drama by Darren Aronofsky, fast becoming one of the most sought-after and talented filmmakers of modern times. The film's tale of sought-after perfection and its consequences is a plot that, honestly, has been tried one too many times by many films, most of them used as family-friendly plot-lines by mainstream studios. Aronofsky, however, bravely shows the stark consequences of this, and boldly shows the raw consequence of perfection to its brutal honesty. We ask ourselves, eventually, should we work hard for what we want, or should we only strive for what we need? And should we go down that hard road, is it too late to turn back?With that, we come to our star, Natalie Portman, who delivers a tour-de-force performance, a career-making one as Nina. For an actress to play such a challenging role which requires a various cocktail of emotions, and for her to pull it off so brilliantly, it takes true, raw talent, and she commands every scene with her stark performance. It is a mesmerizing performance that will engage and floor those who see it.Coming to the other actors, Vincent Cassel is terrifically slimy yet charming as the artistic director who seduces Nina to bring her darker side out. His aggressive and fierce persona gave a lot of power to his character who (un)intentionally took Nina to a downward spiral. Mila Kunis, gorgeous as ever, exhibits a wild, youthful charge as Lily, as she constantly ""challenges"" Nina she displays a sinister vibe to her character, and then back to being happy-go-lucky again. Barbara Hershey also strongly plays a character who shows hidden tendencies, and while not exaggerating it, Hershey underplays her character so well that it's near impossible to find out that she has issues concerning her daughter, at least during the first quarter of the film. Finally we have Winona Ryder, as Leroy's ex-lead Beth, disgruntled and angry at him for firing her and replacing her with Nina instead.Darren Aronofsky's usual crew returns here to work on the film, and they work wonders with what they have. Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin pen the screenplay with care and crafts a balanced and coherent tale. Using their script, the crew puts it to fantastic effect: Cinematographer Matthew Libatique captures the dancers by frenetically using his camera to follow the dancers from the backstage onto the stage itself, and then revolving around various dancers as they perform on the stage in order to thrust the audience directly into the action as an experience. Editor Andrew Weisblum paces the film accordingly without it being too fast or shot, and with some of the shots so perfectly placed together it makes the story better. Clint Mansell's music in the film is a brilliant piece of work. Production design and art direction utilizes full use of the State University of New York's Performing Arts Center at Purchase, from the ballerinas practicing to the main event during the film's exhilarating 20-minute finale.Lastly, there is Aronofsky himself, who crafts the film with a detailed eye and a strong visual sense. He knows how to utilize Libatique's camera and use it to bring out the full effect of the scene he's shooting, be it from the simplest of static shots to the complex choreography of the ballerinas. His huge passion and dedication to the film can be seen through the actors, and not just particularly though Portman herself.Darren Aronofsky continues to prove himself as a tour-de-force filmmaker who can make effective and engaging quality films, ever since his extremely depressing but superb magnum opus ""Requiem For A Dream"" a decade ago. With ""Black Swan"" he brought out the best in Natalie Portman, and continues his streak as one of the most brilliant directors working today. See this movie, and may the Academy reward Portman for her work. She deserves it. After graduating as a child star, and after a reasonably well career in between, Portman has grown into a beautiful young woman and a fantastic young actress, and this movie is the result of plenty of hard work over the years. Well done.Without a doubt one of 2010's very best films.Overall rating: 90/100",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Kindergarten filmmaking,"Mix horror, thriller, childish ""boo!"" effect, lots of corny camera movements, simmer it with over-dramatic music and lighting, the result is an art fraud that'll fool audience and critics alike. That's Black Swan for you.First of all, what acting? Portman has only one facial expression which was magnified by the endless, tiring, and meaningless close-ups. 10 minutes into the film one is already sick of her shifty eyes and short breaths.Then there's the very shallow plot and lousy dialogue. There's no character development. The few talking parts are inconsistent and one-dimensional. Most people are mere blurry passing shadows. The crucial night out was totally incoherent. Things happen for no particular reason. The girl still shows no sign of desperation or desire. And it's supposed to lead to her ""letting it out"" and ""living a little"" by having red eyes and imagined feathers? wtf?And the lack of continuity! You'd think someone flipped the negatives. So bad I was hoping it's deliberate; an effort to display the mirroring yet twisted hallucination. But it's too subtle - one thing this film is anything but!The dichotomy of the white and black swans is symbolized literally (and solely!) by the white and black outfits. It's unforgivably lazy to convey a person's inner transformation by simply pulling a black singlet over a white one, and later covering all with a gray sweater - this is the filmmaking for the kindergarten!Finally, this is perhaps the only film about an art form that doesn't portray any of the beauty and passion of that art. Ballet is brutally and shamefully dismissed. It's reduced down to no more than the wooden doll spinning on the toes. Such annihilation is a blasphemy. Why does the filmmaker pick a topic he has absolutely no interest in? Instead of the power of ballet itself the film opts for the CGI effect which adds neither visual pleasure nor emotional value. wtf?Someone needs to wake up to the fact that female masturbation and lesbian sex don't make a film avant-garde. What happened to good scripts? Can nobody learn anything from the masterpiece ""The Piano Teacher""? Yet ""Black Swan"" receives such undeserved rave reviews...... wtf?",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

At times it will make you cringe & squirm, and at times it will challenge you like a good murder mystery. Like all Aranofsky films I've seen, it will warp your perspective and take you to an unreal, shadowy world where nothing seems quite right. And, if you don't already have em, it will make you buy a pair of nail clippers.Taken on the surface as a straightforward story, the film is good. But if you read between the lines and consider unspoken issues of mental illness, personality disorder, anorexia, bulimia, incest, child abuse, etc, then the film is great. If you haven't guessed, it takes you to some dark places.""Black Swan"" is a shadowy, perverse thriller that reminds me of the works of David Lynch (Mulholland Drive, Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet) except that director Aranofsky has a more lucid approach than Lynch has, in my opinion. Aranofsky's films seem more deliberate and mathematical, whereas Lynch is more arbitrary and sometimes just plain weird.My only real criticism of ""Black Swan"" is that certain things occur that are so far-fetched it may be hard to swallow. But if you accept this as a mindbending dark fantasy, I guess anything goes. To properly enjoy this film you can't be too critical of small details. Instead you should just go along for the ride, always thinking of the significance and symbolism of events, rather than cause. I guess not everyone has a pair of nail clippers...

As constrained and striving and talented as the leading character,"Black Swan (2010)There are some thrills and some beautiful elements to any movie about the ballet, and to any Darren Aronovsky film, so ""Black Swan"" is wired for success. Add hardworking veteran Natalie Portman to the mix, and in a nutshell you have the movie.""Black Swan"" has all the feelings of a bold, epic opera, a melodrama with psychological arrows, and fairy tale about being a girl and wanting to make it as the swan, as the ballerina. Us guys can get that, too, even if we don't pirouette so well.Sadly, if not unexpectedly (I've never seen real depth to Aronovsky's universe), there is a constant exchange of sensation for penetration. The writers almost willfully give us plot devices we've seen before. The idea of a person (Portman's Nina the ballerina) who is too uptight to be successful and just has to be less perfect to be more perfect is an appealing but well worn idea. The characters are mostly cardboard clichés, like the bitter and controlling mother and the womanizing and aesthetically superior super-male director, neither of whom we really get to know.Come to think of it, we don't really learn anything about the character of our leading female. Nina is a richly played stereotype. I don't mean she doesn't have a range of emotions, and certainly Portman makes the most of the emotional and physical pain in her memorable performance. The one force-fed diversion from the straight and narrow world of New York Ballet is when Nina steps out and goes nightclubbing, and her disorientation in that world only reminds us of what she is not. But surely her young adult life has had some shaping influences, some quirks of real personality, something besides the apparent trap of being a little girl forever.And then, in what did surprise me for Aronovsky, the filming itself is awkward. The camera-work was really nice, strictly speaking--lots of moving camera, lots of anxiety in the unsteady image. But the light, the lighting, is painfully unexplored, unexploited. Once I noticed this, I couldn't help see how many of the scenes were filmed with a deliberately plain, almost ""ordinary"" light. Many movies are of course enhanced by being real world and even ""badly"" lit, the characters falling into shadow, the color of the light unappealing. But this is not story about the ordinary. Some of the scenes are even completely imaginary, and others are on the stage, with theater lights. By the last scene, the great performance, with Tchaikovky's music throbbing in the background, there is some sense of light and drama, and yet, amazingly, it is relatively withheld.There are many movies that this one draws on, or draws up next to for comparison, from ""The Phantom of the Opera"" which is truly disturbing to any number of Zeffirelli productions which seem to have the same intention to wow the audience above all else, and do so with amazing visual and sonic excess. ""Black Swan"" has the intention common to Aranovsky's work to be profound, and this might be the big flaw in his career. That is, I don't think you succeed at trying to be profound. Instead, you succeed at doing something with perception and originality and subtlety, and then you might, as a product (but not a direct goal) discover, or uncover, something that is in fact profound.So, this movie will make you think a little and it is very enjoyable. I found myself laughing out loud a few times when the effort to impress the audience became ludicrous, but at other times I was engaged and impressed. Go with reasonable expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Natalie Portman powers this outstanding film,"Black Swan is just as much about a woman dancing in Swan Lake as it is a modern retelling of the story. Nina Sayers starts off as the perfect Swan Queen, pure, innocent and sweet. The film sees Nina (Natalie Portman) preparing for the performance of Swan Lake, as she takes on the role of the White Swan she seems to be becoming more and more like her evil twin, the Black Swan. This film encapsulates the essence of Tchaikovsky's original ballet, playing with the lines between good and evil and displaying the conflict and delusions of the protagonist.Nina begins as a young ballerina who is hoping to receive a larger role in this season of the New York City Ballet as she is a perfectionist who couldn't work harder at her art form. She lives at home with her over-protective mother, a former dancer herself who invades into Nina's life. Thomas Leroy, the head of the dance company, is hesitant to select Nina as the Swan Queen in the company's new production of Swan Lake. This is because Thomas does not believe that Nina has the passion and emotion to portray both the White and the Black Swans.Then another dancer from San Francisco joins the company, Lily (Mila Kunis). She seems to be everything Nina is not, outgoing, bold and open about herself. Lily's presence puts pressure on Nina, as well as the pressure of the role itself, of her mother and of the other dancers who wanted to be the Swan Queen and claim Nina slept with Thomas to get the part. Nina begins to hallucinate and slowly loses her mind with all of the emotional and physical stress she has on her.Natalie Portman powers the film with an incredible performance. The character of Nina is acted amazingly as she descends into madness. Portman drives the spirit of the movie, a seemingly fragile girl who becomes passionate and aggressive through her own creation. The supporting cast is great as well. This is by far the greatest performance we have yet seen out of both Portman and Kunis.Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler) directs the film with an absurd quality that makes it great. Black Swan is incredibly tense, with emotion being explored deeply. Aronofsky also explores the themes of sexuality and violence in a way that disorients the audience and almost makes people question their own sanity. Overall, Black Swan is a terrific film which delves deeper than most thrillers, exploring the psychological cause and effects of actions, as well as displaying the art of ballet and the stress associated with a role with almost perfection.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Gripping but nasty,"I'm afraid this movie falls within the brilliant but nasty class, or to put it another way it deals exclusively with the darker side of human nature. There is no light and shade, no humour, just a careering down the slope to inevitable disaster. We are very effectively put right into the mind of the principal character, a girl-woman who is an outstanding dancer but a very fragile human being in a tough environment. Her mother, a former dancer, has undoubtedly pushed her hard, but you can't put Nina's troubles down to Mum alone. There is Thomas the Svengali –like choreographer who is trying to arouse her dormant sexual feelings to get a better performance, and jealous other dancers. Plus, I suppose, the bitch-goddess success, more evident in New York than just about anywhere else.Director Darren Aronofsky succeeds only too well in putting us inside Nina's mind. The loud soundtrack makes even the subway's clatter sinister and Tchaikovsky's music (played backwards apparently) menacing. The shaky hand-held camera adds to the claustrophobic malaise, though the grey concrete of backstage Lincoln Center (not the actual place) is pretty grim as well. A ballet movie for masochists, I thought. Even so, Natalie Portman puts in a brilliant performance. She is absolutely convincing, as are her delusions. It is certainly difficult to distinguish between what is actually happening and what is merely the product of Nina's addled imagination. I also liked Mila Kunis as the over-eager understudy/competitor and Barbara Hershey as Nina's controlling but anxious mother.Classical Ballet is normally a refined form of theatre, and the production here follows the conventions – and then trashes them. There is too much suffering and not enough art, it seems. I don't know whether the original writer was trying to make a point about the suffering required to produce great art, but Aronofsky certainly makes Nina suffer. He also makes a mess of Tchaikovsky's work, which is conveniently out of copyright and unacknowledged except in the very small print. I don't think I'll be rushing to see his next film.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great psychological drama,"Great psychological drama, though not perfect. Incredibly intense plot and direction, allied with a superb performance by Natalie Portman, and good supporting performances from Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey.However, it is not totally original nor unpredictable. The broader conclusion was quite foreseeable. If you have seen all of Darren Aronofsky's previous movies, Black Swan will seem like an amalgam of them. The ending is very reminiscent of The Wrestler and the fantasy scenes reminiscent of Pi and, especially, Requiem For a Dream.A great movie though I can't help but feel that the themes and broad plot are not at all original.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Was Nina Crazy?  Geez, I Never Would Have Guessed...","Wow, I really hated this! I don't understand the hype, quite honestly. Yes, Natalie Portman's performance was very good, but unfortunately it's in a cinematic vehicle that was as cliché as they come. They essentially knock you over the head with the fact that the main character, Nina, is losing her mind at every (predictable) twist and turn. Very gratuitous and clumsily done. It's extremely campy and, as for the ""scare factor"", I was left feeling nothing. And that's pretty much how I felt about this film as a whole - nothing.For a much more subtle, well done portrayal of the theme of an ""inside view"" of mental illness, you need look no further than ""A Beautiful Mind."" I know Portman will probably be nominated for Best Actress, but if Black Swan is nominated for an Oscar for best picture, it will be a sad commentary on the collective tastes of our society as a whole and the film community, in particular.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

Darren never disappointed me.,"This movie was another jewel in Darren's bright career. The movie was so strong i almost cried. it was a perfect movie. The movie starts strangely, it reminds me strongly his past movies that were also awesome. Its not his best movie, how could i say such a thing, after all ""pi"" is the best movie i have ever seen in my opinion. Its a great film, with great actors and actresses, Natalie Portman was once again incredible, Swan Lake is my favorite classical music creation and there are things that makes me feel the movie wasn't EXACTLY what you were watching. It was a little deeper and i was aware of it because i have seen almost all of Darren's movies. The movie is just perfect. It's exactly my cup of tea.

Natalie Portman's Best Performance,"I've sort of fallen away from Darren Aronofsky over the past few years. I loved both PI and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, but the unenthusiastic reviews for THE FOUNTAIN kept me from running out to see it and I've still not gotten around to THE WRESTLER. I probably wouldn't have even bothered with BLACK SWAN due to my complete disinterest in all things ballet-related except all the critical buzz caught my attention. And it doesn't hurt that Natalie Portman is probably my favorite actress working in Hollywood at the moment. The film focuses on Nina Sayers (Portman), a dedicated ballerina who aspires to perfection in her craft at the constant encouragement of her mother (Barbara Hershey), a former ballerina past her prime who never reached the spotlight. When her ballet troupe is to set to begin rehearsals for Swan Lake, Nina is determined to acquire the starring role of the Swan Queen/Black Swan but her instructor (Vincent Cassel) finds her too controlled. Enter Lily: a wild child from San Francisco who urges Nina to unleash her wild side. Soon, Nina's psyche begins to crack under the pressure of her obsession with the role and her delving into the passionate mind of the Black Swan.I love a good film that deals with a person's descent into madness and if there's one thing Aronofsky appears to understand, it's madness. From the beginning, we see small signs that all is not right in the mind of Portman's Nina. Her mother is an obviously overbearing sort, living her ballet dreams vicariously through the successes of her daughter. Her mother's blatant mental abuse has taken a toll on Nina and it's made apparent when she nearly loses her chance to tackle the dual role of the Swan Queen/Black Swan in her company's rendition of Swan Lake. Thomas Leroy, director of the ballet company, feels Nina is perfect in technique but lacks the passion and ability to let loose for the role of the Black Swan. As Nina succumbs to Leroy's sexual tensions and the arrival of party-girl Lily, we watch as Nina suffers worse and worse hallucinations as well as bizarre transformations as Nina slowly embodies the Black Swan.I think what I found most appealing about this film was Natalie Portman. She's definitely a strong actress (see V FOR VENDETTA) but here we see her as a tortured individual whose grip on reality is slipping. She nails it here and, while I can't say for certain because I hadn't seen any of the other Best Actress nominees, she seems to me deserving of the Oscar she won (or at least worthy of the nomination). Mila Kunis takes an interesting turn. I'm so accustomed to seeing her in goofy comedies (FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL) that it was interesting to see her take on more of a ""bad girl"" image and prove that serious drama is in her realm of talent. I am also to see that Aronofsky maintains the unique style of his filmmaking I loved in his early films and it's given me motivation to check out the few I've missed. BLACK SWAN is a taut thriller in my opinion, despite what nay-saying I've heard from friends and those online. It's a tense film and the final act in which Nina's mind finally crumbles in the Swan Lake performance is one of the best sequences I'd watched all year.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Dark Side of Dance,"Black Swan is a story about realization and how we discover ourselves when in new environments. Swan Queen is the role, and it takes its toll on Nina (Natalie Portman) as she struggles to release her inner darkness. Playing the lead role in this production requires both innocence and spontaneity. It is certainly not for everyone.The transformation of a sweet girl into a monster is the real hook in this film. How different settings can change people is a fascinating theme, and Natalie Portman certainly delivers in portraying how good becomes evil. The plasticity of our mind; how our behaviours are so volatile at times really reflects true human nature.I enjoyed Black Swan not for its acting (it was mediocre overall except for good performances from the leads), but because the story delved into the true essence of how we are all moulded by external factors. We all evolve over time, whether it be mentally or physically. And whether we accept this fact or not, Black Swan does an exceptional job in proving it.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Extraordinary!!,"Unless you're a fan of ballet, a film about ballet might not be everyone's cup of tea. However, add hints of mystery and some horror elements - and a very good script - and it might have a wider appeal. Young boys might still not feel comfortable telling their friends they watched a movie about ballet...Whether you're into ballet or not, you've surely heard of 'Swan Lake' before. Personally I've never seen a performance of 'Swan Lake' and until 'Black Swan' had no idea what it was about (although I have heard of it before and know the famous music).Ballerina Nina (Natalie Portman) is selected to audition for the new production of 'Swan Lake'. When she is chosen for the role, she finds it is much harder than she thought. She has to play two roles - that of the white swan, and the black swan - which is like an evil alter ego. This takes a literal turn when Nina does everything in her power to become the character. As she undergoes a metamorphosis just like her character is supposed to, we witness her disturbing descent into madness.There to further complicate her life, is her mother, who is a weird character - almost like a restraint tyrant. The film gets really creepy towards the end. This was extraordinary, actually!Natalie Portman delivers an excellent performance as Nina. The make-up and visuals are also stunning. 'Black Swan' was indeed a pleasant surprise.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Clothed Erotica is Damn Unsexy,"Black Swan is the story of Nina Sayars (Natalie Portman) a professional ballerina struggling to come of age when she fulfils her lifelong dream of landing the lead part of her company's latest production, Swan Lake. The thrill of this accomplishment is tarnished by the fact that she is unable to deal with her overbearing mother (Barbara Hershey), questionably ethical director (Vincent Cassel), taking over the throne of the former star lead (Winona Ryder) and competing with free spirited newcomer (Mila Kunis).Director Darren Aronofsky displays the story on the back of Portman's character that is originally plain and innocent, allowing the viewer to observe firsthand the pain and effort she endures to obtain the role, and the impressive skill of the performances that result. On top of this, the viewer experiences Nina's psychological breakdown, her bulimia, gross obsessions, paranoid hallucinations and out of body experiences. Kudos for Portman for learning the ballet moves, but I have seen her act better than this, the innocence and naivety was overplayed for a character who has survived a cutthroat dance company.The movie has a pretty basic premise and therefore the build up doesn't take very long. The first two acts rely on the gratuity of Nina's obsessions and her quite unerotic exploration of her sexuality (Wild Things this ain't!). Apart from a few ""Am I crazy or not"" moments, the actual substance of the first two thirds of the movie is quite dry and ridiculous which is a bit disappointing.However when all seems gone with this movie, it packs a real punch for the final act. Blending the breakdown of Nina's psychosis with her first on stage performance is brilliant and well worth the wait.I left this film feeling that it was made for the ending and the blank first two acts were filled in on the way. It tries to shock you for entertainment with gross obsessions, but results in being gratuitous. And clothed-erotica is damn unsexy and ridiculous and insults the viewer. Unsure if it is worth the Oscar buzz, but who knows with the best quality movies coming out these days being CG cartoons.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Chilling!,"Darren Aronofsky's 'Black Swan' is a Chilling film. It's scary, ambitious, abstract & courageous. Darren Aronofsky is at his best here, as he manages to hold your attention in most parts of the film, and Natalie Portman delivers a performance that was meant for an Oscar!'Black Swan' tells the story of a Nina played by Portman, a ballet dancer, perfect fit for the White Swan, while Lily played by Mila Kunis, has a personality that matches the Black Swan. When the two compete for the parts, Nina finds a dark side to herself.About 107-minutes long, this psychological thriller never really loses pace. In fact, the writing, in some sequences is nail-biting. But, the culmination, leaves you in mixed emotions. Though beautifully shot & executed, the desired impact seems to be missing. A little more of detail would've worked big time! Aronofsky directs this chilly fare, with el'an. In fact, his Oscar-Nomination was so well-deserving. Cinematography is brilliant. The Ballet Dances are wonderfully performed.Performance-Wise: Portman obviously steals the show in an Oscar-Winning Performance. And her Ballet Dances, are mesmerizing. Mila Kunis is a revelation.

Aronofsky's finest,"Every time that I see 'Black Swan' again, I succumb to its beautifully dark and sinister spell some more. I cannot pick any fault with it, and every aspect - be it technical or narrative-based, doesn't only make me fall in love with Darren Aronofsky's masterpiece a little bit more, but it makes me fall in love with cinema a lot more (I didn't think it was possible).Because a masterpiece, a cinematic tour de force and a pure example of engaging storytelling is exactly what 'Black Swan' is. Much of the plaudits note Natalie Portman's excellent performance as the highlight of the piece, and rightly so - she hits all of the right beats and captures all of the torture felt by her ballet star 'Nina Sayers', whose decaying mental state is worsened by ballet rival 'Lily' (an exceptional Mila Kunis), one of the most overbearing parent characters in film history (a sinisterly creepy Barbara Hershey) and her somewhat sex obsessed director, 'Thomas' (a captivating Vincent Cassel in his best performance in an English-spoken film).But as mentioned, Portman is the star of the show, in a career defining performance - a role that she will probably never match, let alone top. She is perfect in every sense, and imperfect at all of the right moments. Portman firmly established herself as one of the best actresses in the world by showing her dedication by learning ballet and becoming a pro by training with Kunis non- stop for 6 months prior to filming.'Black Swan' exists as a film students dream, a perfect text to analyse for an essay; be it how each of the characters mirrors a role from 'Swan Lake' with psychology battering effect or the exquisite way that the film is edited, making it so you notice something new every single time that you watch it, as faces change, inanimate objects move and senses are assaulted.Matthew Libatique's cinematography is also a stand-out motivation to watch the film, even if the story doesn't appeal. His long duration tracking shots following 'Nina' walk around bleak locations are only bettered by how the dancing is framed. As someone who has never been interested in ballet, I was completely transfixed by the dances and how the camera moved flawlessly to track the perfect movements for long takes at a time.The music combines with the visuals fascinatingly as well, with music from the 'Swan Lake' production being used as a repetitive motif to astonishingly wonderful and uneasy effect, never making the audience feel comfortable. The music is one of the main reasons that the final act of the film stays with me; the editing of the sound is powerful, rising and rising and rising as the shocking climax descends into more and more chaos - all with that beautiful and frightening music thundering around you.The time that I saw 'Black Swan' in the cinema was one of most memorable cinema experiences of my life. It was full of old women who were clearly there expecting a nice film about ballet, only to filter out bit by bit as the crazed narrative unravelled. Other notable members of the audience included men being dragged by their better halves, looking catastrophically bored at the beginning and increasingly becoming more and more hooked as the film went on (I'm almost entirely sure that the infamous lesbian sex scene had nothing to do with it).But the fact that a film like this reached such a wide audience is a testament in itself. It has no easy answers, each viewing will potentially give you a different interpretation and the closer you watch the more rewarding the experience will be. Definitely not the ingredients for a mainstream success, but genius like this cannot be rightly ignored by anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A trance through obsession,"The Black Swan is a very deep movie, and yet for everyone.

Darren contrasts his movie's idea!,"Being a fan of Aronofsky's artworks, I have always looked up to his talented way of working symbols into his pictures, and that's why many moviegoers are only capable of watching his movies at face value.Central to the plot is the story of a dancer who is selected for a play called ""the swan lake"" and the plot portrays her struggles within her perfectionism due to the performance she has. As a result, she faces a sequence of problems both mental and physical. The script is top notch, and its greatness aside, the description of the events is really phenomenal. Have you seen other movies of Darren such as REQUIEM FOR A DREAM or MOTHER, you are aware of the fact of watching his movies in a different angle. That being said, not everything in front of our eyes is completely true. Though becoming a swan during a performance is fantasy and , honestly, ridiculous, that's not what exactly is and it somehow depicts the impacts that perfectionism can cause to human being.
This point divides opinions and therefore, we have a group of people who are in love with this movie, contrary to the ones who can't hate it anymore.Speaking of the characters, first off, the acting was perfection. With the solid performances the cast offer, we are left with great performances alongside their well written characters, which makes it hit the top. Let's also praise Natalie Portman, whose talent was dead obvious from the very beginning, for the strength it contributed to this masterpiece. Hardly can I imagine another actress replacing Natalie for this complicated character.Getting to the technical points of the Black Swan, everything is well set, especially its cinematography for it was really matched and synchronized with the atmosphere of the movie. The score was beautiful as well, but not as good as other movies like the Requiem.Besides all the perfect performances, top technical points, top notch storyline and etc. , I would like to encourage you in order to dig into the symbols and the simple events that at face value can be taken for granted so easily. Everything has a meaning here; from that weird lesbian sex, to the bizarre imaginations of our protagonist.

"A beautifully violent masterpiece in every single way, except for one!","Black Swan is the story of Nina trying to become the top performer in her ballet class. This film absolutely portrays what some people ""feel"" rather than act like in the pressure of the spotlight, but it does it in a horror movie kind of way and this is what makes it brilliant!Black Swan caught me off guard. I kind of forgot what Darren Aronofsky's films were like. Boy was I in for a roller-coaster ride!I gripped the edge of my seat every time the dancers tipped on their tip toes (sound funny right, but a good director can make anything possible). That's just the beginning. There will be a lot more reasons to hold on to your pillow.Every scene is acted out perfectly by the actors, and Natalie is no different. Another reviewer said she usually has no trouble showing skin, but here she does the opposite and does it perfectly. I completely agree! Natalie certainly made this movie what it is!The only flaw of the film, in my opinion, is the sexual scenes. I do agree that maybe this delves in to the nature of the film, and maybe a sheltered, schitzo character like Nina's would go through this in real life. But it was hard for me to accept when the rest of the film shows how chauvinistic men can be. Yet chauvinistic men would probably enjoy this scene. To me that's kind of hypocritical. THERE IS a way to shoot a sex scene without making it like a porn video. So I think this could have been done better.Also this movie just isn't for anyone and I can't give a movie a 10 that is like that. Maybe if the sex scenes were toned down I would.(Contrary to what some reviewers say, sheltered people like Nina are very common in all walks of life making this very believable!)",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

The graphic scenes of emotional and sexual abuse, eating disorders, delusions, attempted murder and self-mutilation are so disturbing I need to label them psychotic.

A psychological thriller blockbuster dressed in an art-house tutu.,"A modern blockbuster art-house thriller, completely compelling whilst also being alienating and purposefully distant.One of the most accurate and frightening depiction of insanity, obsession, and commitment to art in modern cinema. All set to the double-backed story of Swan Lake, with masterful performances by actress Natalie Portman and director Darren Aronofsky. You will be hard-pushed to find a better modern psychological thriller.The pacing in Black Swan is impeccable, you cannot help but be swept up in the madness of the 3rd act. Natalie Portman's acting is certainly 'best actress' worthy, which is surprising considering Black Swan is a rather racy and dark film compared to the normalI say that it is dressed in an art-house tutu because while the themes and allegory at play and the subject matter is more akin to art-house, the way in which it is presented is certainly not. It is an accessible, entertaining, crowd-pleasing film. This isn't a flaw, I wish more blockbusters did the same. In fact Black Swan works excellently as a portkey for art-house cinema virgins - Persona is an obvious recommendation for anyone who liked the Black Swan's themes of identity and the dissolution of identity.Oh yeah by the way too, I wouldn't watch this with anyone else.

BLACK SWAN,"In the psychological melodrama of director Darren Aronofsky Black Swan, the film tells the story of ballerina Nina (Natalie Portman), beautiful, weak, naive and on the verge of a nervous breakdown due to her floundering in the double character performance in the Swan Lake Ballet. Nina, a kind and fragile girl, is undoubtedly ideal for the role of White Swan, but the director of the work Thomas (Vincent Castle), doubts about her ability to embody the role of the Black Swan, he pretends that she can master the technique of dance and not feeling.
Nina, who has dedicated her life to ballet, has years of striving for perfection, years of physical and mental training that take you away from normal life. In the art of ballet, its performance is represented by the illusion of triumph over reality or even victory over gravity and this struggle between idealism and reality consumes it completely, especially since we feel that this was not necessarily her choice but the most reality she found herself in. Her mother, Erica (Barbara Hershey), was a ballerina once and once, and now all her life is about pursuing her daughter's career and living together in a small apartment.
Together they spend time talking like sisters and yet she feels that something is wrong.
The main storyline of the ""Black Swan"" is traditional: what happens behind the scenes, competition and artistic jealousy, but Aronowsky takes these elements and takes us on a frightening journey from within Nina's mind that seems to start confusing the boundaries of reality and illusion. This perception is evident to us at the beginning of the film with dream scenes (literally) to intersect with the dream of a ballerina's life in fact, so it is fair to see that the film is about fear, love and hate, fear of failure, fear of being let down by your body, fear of ignoring, perfect love. The fear of causing disappointment to the woman she loves - her mother - and she also hates her deep hatred is the cause of everything that happens.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
When reflections start looking back,"I do a little taoist meditation exercise most nights that involves me staring at my reflection in a mirror. It gives me an eerie feeling most times, doing it last night after I'd finished Black Swan was almost unsettling though and I had to hold the sink at some point. The exercise is about adjusting the gaze so that you're looking into yourself from the outside, or being looked at by your own self. The point of transition, when you become aware of the meditation taking place, is when the reflection seizes to be a reflection. Black Swan of course does not tell us about tao, like most Western art it's a movie of polar opposites, light and dark, yet subliminally it grasps higher concepts that deal with the perception of a world.This is one of my favourite types of film, the psychodrama that observes the fracture of a soul from within the fracture, from behind the cracked glass, and like the best works of Polanski Altman or Lynch it's in the hallucination of the mind that it finds a raison d'etre, the handle and hook by which it will sink deeper into a meaningful unreality. For the first part of the film the Swan Queen, the good decent shy young girl who wants to be the leading dancer, can see her reflection in the mirror, then as we near the end of the film, the reflections begin to see her. This is still happening from within though, it's the soul itself pulling the strings, there's no supernatural touch or the ambiguous suggestion of one. Some may find unsubtle that Aronofosky will frequently trap characters in their mirrored images, I only find it necessary, like a western can better communicate its ideas in the dusty sierra. Eventually, another mirror this time to the ballet story of the Swan Queen, the Swan Queen becomes her negative image and gives the performance of a lifetime but she pays a Faustian price for it. The idea is not earth-shattering of course but I find it wholesome, proper, what it should be.Natalie Portman gives us one of the great fragile distraught female protagonists. Susannah York, Harriet Andersson, Catherine Deneuve, Zhora Lampert, Isabelle Adjani, Naomi Watts, with the exception of Adjani, she betters them all. I like the sudden neurotic touches of the imbalanced mother, which reminds me of Lynch, and how well Portman can play the figurative swan fraught with perils on all sides of her path. It's the soul that is at stake here and I love how Aronofsky creates the nightmare world. It's a nightmare world because Nina is not ready for it, because she can't let go and be a part of the flow, as though the world itself can sense the pull and resistance and begins to spot the anomaly. That anomaly in herself is rendered with monstrous almost-Zulawski tones of self-destruction and hysteric behaviour, and the sketch itself reminds me of similar wonderful films, Mulholland Dr., Repulsion, Images.I wrote in the other thread that I think Aronosfky's timing with Black Swan is perfect because it allows himself to be directly compared with Fincher and Nolan. In Requiem he was struggling for maturity, here he comes to it naturally. By comparison to his peers, his cinematic eye fascinates me because it can imagine things and bring them alive, it dazzles and is dazzled in return. I love the scenes where Aronosfky's camera dances along with the ballet, that opening for example I find a stunner. I almost hope The Social Network wins Best Picture so that it will go on to become another Slumdog Millionaire or Hurt Locker to be forgotten in due time, this one on the other hand feels to me like special, spookily idiosynchratic, work that deserves a smaller audience than will eventually see it.",,Anonymous,Drama
A beautifully dark masterpiece,"I can't believe I've waited this long to watch this film and it is very much worth the view. This story is a cautionary tale of what happens when one gets consumed by passion and it carries a disturbing but strangely resonating execution. This is the best Natalie Portman's best performance I've seen, Portman does a wonderful job bringing Nina to light and capturing her gradual descent into madness. ""Black Swan"" is masterfully directed, often switching between the grand world of ballet and the tight, almost catastrophic scenery of Nina's intimate moments outside the dance stage. A definite recommend, although this movie is not for the faint of heart(i.e., if skin picking, nail peeling, etc., is bothersome to you, you're really not going to have much fun with this).",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
At First Glance,"Never wait to see a film after awards season. That is what I did and it may have tainted my expectations a bit. Personally, I was very excited to see Black Swan. I had been diligently following the film before they had even started shooting. I like some of Natalie's work and was intrigued to see some of Aronofsky's. Ballet is also a big interest of mine. I love psychological thrillers, or any film that toys w/ my mind and makes me think. So Black Swan from the beginning had the perfect ingredients for me. My mistake though was that I did not get to see the film until after awards season. After all of the hype, the praise, the pageantry. I think the overkill pumped my expectations up too much and it made the movie seem a bit lackluster when I finally saw it. The runtime was too short for my taste, and I don't think the director and cast pushed the story and characters as far as they could have. I had the feeling they were either being generic at some points or playing it safe. I did not even favor Natalie that much in her performance. I know there was a lot of praise for her, and I do not mean to diminish the work she put into her performance, but it was not as earth shattering as some people found it. To me Black Swan did not take the leap it could have, it did not push its boundaries farther (as a film, the characters, the stories, etc.) It teetered between going all the way and playing it safe. It was okay to me in the end. I honestly would have found more enjoyment in seeing a production of Swan Lake as opposed to this film. Maybe I should have done that.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
worse film to watch if you love the ballet,"the black swan is a weak uninspiring story It is very modern American in attitude and interaction, and misses the whole point of dance and performance.i found the lesbian inuendo and sex scenes overdone unessasary and seemed as though they were put there to try to liven up a very dull plot.i didn't find the film scary, i didn't feel anything as there was no anticipation or build up to a credible end. there was not nearly enough good dancing.i was irritated by the almost constant panting by natalie portman throughout the film. The only part of the film i liked watching was the main black swan sequence when the dancing was good and the cgi was imaginative and well done.This film could have been so much better with a decent story, more cohesion and a little higher thought. I was bored and turned off the whole thing was disappointing, unauthentic unbelievable and like the dancing, did not flow.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

I'm still a Coppelia kind of guy...,"I feel bad for not reviewing this sooner but I think enough people have already done that.I want to stress that when my dad took me to see this movie, I knew absolutely nothing about it except the title. I assumed it was some kind of spy code-name or something like that.I so wish I could experience more movies this way...rather than research them myself and going in knowing the concept because absolutely no one else in my life actually watches movies. Seriously.There were these two mature women behind us and I am like 90% sure that they had not researched this movie and went in thinking it was going to be like Ballet Shoes or something. I could here their reactions but in all fairness to them they stayed the whole way.There's one particular moment where I'm like ""oh...it MUST be a dream"" and that is when it stopped being powerful (for the moment) because it suddenly went a bit too Harry Potter and lost a lot of its this-world power though having said that, you never really know what's going on in this movie.I'm sure we could have an argument about what was a dream and indeed what was not and I seem to have minority opinions on that point.It annoyed me when those chicos just generalize ballet...It's great to see Padme actually getting some work though obviously it is better to not recognize any actors in a thing.It's rare that I review a movie and do not actually...review it but I think you know already that this is an experience and a half.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Overrated,"I could accept the heavy psychosis aspect which was entirely predictable from the start. I could focus on the ballet dancing if the movie would let me, which it didn't because the psychosis bit forbade this to happen, every minute, every second of the 'artistic' part of the movie. I'm glad I watched it 14 years after its release, because my mindset was clear and unaffected by any kind of critique or evaluation. This was a film without any identity, some sex, some lesbian sex, a few horror moments and a lot of predictable scenes. Oops, I forgot to mention ballet dancing. That's probably because by the end of the movie, I'd completely forgotten about it. Portman is an exceptionally talented actress, that's why I didn't give it a 4.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Darren Aronofsky's twisted tale is both gripping and uncompromising, and not without the genuine performance by Natalie Portman","This Darren Aronofsky piece is a bleak and twisted tale focusing on the dark side of the world of ballerina, and far from ways you would to expect. It is an uncompromising character study of a woman who dreams to landing her dream role in a ballet are pushing to grueling limits, both psychological and physical. With Aronofsky's signature directing style operating the wheel, this film leans far from your average melodrama. There are shades of both horror and fantasy soaring through the atmosphere, drawing reminiscence of David Lynch. In this case, it is safe to classify this as a psychological thriller. How can a film about women dancing and prancing around in tutus slide into such bizarre territory? That is where Aronofsky's visual storytelling and gripping testament of psychological warfare come into play The director treats ballet as not just an art form, but as a blood sport with tragic consequences. The pinnacle of this dark, albeit intriguing tale is Natalie Portman who manages to shine high above nearly everything Aronofsky brings to life on screen. This film follows Nina Sayers (played by Natalie Portman), a New York City ballerina living with her overbearing and manipulative mother (played by Barbara Hershey). When Nina auditions for the role of the Black Swan for the musical 'Swan Lake', she manages to impress director Thomas Leroy (played by Vincent Cassel). However, he believes she lacks the sensuality for the role of Black Swan and instead hands her the role of White Swan, replacing an aging ballerina Beth Macintyre (played by Winona Ryder). Meanwhile, the role of the Black Swan handed over to newcomer Lily (played by Mila Kunis). As the premier of the musical approaches, Nina and Lily form a mysterious friendship that spirals into a twisted rivalry of both try desperately to outdo each other. Soon, Nina pushes herself to the point of losing her sanity.Darren Aronofsky's never holds back when portraying his sobering testament on how obsession to surpass one's quality can destroy both your inner and outer being. While he does have the tendency to take things over the top with his surreal imagery on just a few occasions, there is never a moment that feels squandered by any means. Opening up an electrifying ballet sequence shot by beautifully by Matthew Libatique, this film revolves around a character study of a woman who's psychological limits are tested by her obsession to land the role of her dreams, and does so by not just splashing us in the face of emotional resonance but presenting the action through a gripping methodology of visual storytelling. His inspiring methods allow for some dark twists and astounding surprises that leave us questioning what is real and what is not real. Is Nina living an unforgiving nightmare? Or is her obsession with competing against Lily driving her to the brink of mental insanity. Could it be both? Those are thoughts that keep us glued to our seats as we sit back to admire not only the absorbing atmosphere of the world of ballerina seemingly gone mad, but the captivating performances the cast brings to the table. Natalie Portman swallows up the role with tour-de-force versatility and complexity, a performance that allows her to expand her acting chops to astonishing boundaries. She simply grabs you by the heart and fails to let go. Vincent Cassel is genuine in his role as well, banking in sheer humanity and fortitude. It would also be a shame not to mention Mila Kunis's effort in her role. Each minute she and Portman are on screen, their chemistry is powerful, almost spellbinding -- especially in a shocking, yet erotic scene when the two engage in steamy sexual intercourse. There is a certain erotica behind their performances that keeps these actresses shining, not in a way to fulfill viewers' perverted desires but to pervade a sense of eeriness in their relationship. Although their friendship-turned- rivalry is a working hand at keeping the story on fire, it is Natalie Portman's Nina Sayers and her emotionally bleak deterioration into self-destructiveness that works the core of the film.Black Swan is a twisted, surreal, yet gripping psychological drama piece grounded by an uncompromising directorial methodology by Darren Aronofsky and performances by both Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis that simply demand for your attention. As this soars with Aronofsky's trademark style, this film will most certainly not please everyone. If you were uncomfortable by the relentlessly bleak imagery and material of Aronofsky's previous works, you may want to give this one a pass. Otherwise, come see what he has to offer here.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

The destructive and annihilating way of representing dance in the film is impressive!,"Black Swan relates the loss of innocence of the main character in an unpredictable manner, which ultimately refers to the drama, anxiety and self-harm that artists suffer when trying to reach a standard that is difficult to maintain, both physically and psychologically. An absolute honor being able to relate to this film.In it, the highest art is truly shown in a way that manages to be presented in the most artistic and fully cinematic manner. It can be observed in the way everything begins in a dreamy stage of perfection, both in the body and the mind, slowly deteriorating through an abstraction of words overruled by action, and projecting a hyperbolized depiction of the slow death of individuality in the dance world in an intuitive manner.Film has a series of components that make it stand out in the history of humanity, by touching a number of subjects through the symbolism of hyperbolized stories, and managing to artistically emphasize our human desire to connect through creativity. Aronofsky's Black Swan is no exception, as it shines a light on the effects of a stereotype loving culture. Film is like fire and the light by which we sculpt the world. It has the ability to solely change form in matter because atoms cannot develop without it, so through it we have managed to make visible the invisible, by creating sensory lines that are reminiscent of our reality. A worldwide call should be made to become educated in these topics in order to prevent further development of dysfunctional eating behaviors, and stimulate a discovery of internal strengths for everyday lifestyle. A world without beauty or any form of art is unimaginable, yet it has become crucial to work towards an evolution of the way it is taught to be perceived and portrayed, in order to change and enhance what is meant to be valued in it.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Interesting but very shallow ride to schizophrenia,"The movie is stylish and it is well done in technical terms. I cannot judge its realism related to ballet but it is rather unimportant factor here. The more interesting part is the picture of mind slowly descending into hallucinations and madness.In some parts it works and there are some interesting moments. But the story is just way too simple and straightforward without any actual surprise or shock as in ""The Piano Teacher"" for example. These movies are similar in theme, the ""Black Swan"" is prettier, but it is basically just a fantasy or ride to the unreal schizophrenic world whereas ""The Piano Teacher"" is deep, brutal and in many ways almost analytical examination of ill relationship between abusive mother and cold and distant daughter. It is way, way better and faithful to reality than this fantasy carnival ride.The Black Swan tries to present something similar but fails in its narativity. It is a nice movie, yes, it is simpler and more approachable for mass viewer but in the end it is very simple entertainment. It is not bad but definitely nothing memorable. It is somewhat interesting how little story can be contained in so long movie. It is beautiful but it is about all.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
Uncomfortable yet remarkable,"The brilliance of Natalie Portman's dedication to the role can't be understated. It's not often you see actors/actresses fully lose themselves In a role and The black swan is a breathtaking example of this.The films portrayal of Nina sayers (played by Natalie Portman) progressively descending into darkness in order to embody her role as 'Swan Queen' is horrifying, suspenseful and extremely uncomfortable to watch, yet this is so evidently purposeful with every second contributing to Aranofsky's vision of creating a true masterpiece.9/10 I was completely hooked for the entire duration of the film and Natalie Portman was completely deserving of her 'Best actress' award at the 2011 Oscars.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Cultural Cover-up,"Black Swan engaged the culture of the ballet, the beauty of Swan Lake, to tell what is essentially a back stage drama. We have the slave driving mother, babying her daughter, pushing her to accomplish what she couldn't accomplish. We have the vulnerable and fractured offspring, following a path that can only lead to her destruction. Laid on top is the oft Hollywood thematic that a person is not whole unless she is sexually awakened. Technically, the film is excellent. Ms Portman gives a worthy performance. Vincent Cassel demonstrated again why he is once of the best and most versatile film actors in any language. But to my eyes and ears, all of this together with the high culture setting of the ballet, merely covers up a story line that is cliché at the very least.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Black Swan is one of my favorites from Darren Aronofsky,"Darren Aronofsky is probably one of the best directors working today. He has made masterpieces, good movies, and not so good movies. But I think Black Swan is his best film, right next to Requiem For A Dream. Let's talk about Black Swan today, and I'll try not to spoil much. Black swan stars Natalie Portman, and she won an oscar for playing the character Nina Sayers in this movie. She completely deserved it because she did things in this movie that just made me say ""woah"". That's all I'm going to say about the absurd things she did in this movies, and she was amazing, probably her best performance. The conflict that Natalie Portman's character deals with is starring in a ballet performance and she becomes obsessed with this role. I won't tell you what happens to her in this movie to be spoiler free, but some stuff goes down. This movie even scared me at times. Her ballet director is kind of a creep but he completely cares about the performance and Natalie Portman's health and well being. She also has competition for this leading part and some stuff happens with that as well. Mila Kunis was also in this movie, and she actually acted really well. I don't really take her seriously as an actor, but she was really good in this movie. The ending is yet thrilling and terrifying, and the last shot in the movies says so much with so little. The script has a very good narrative and structure, and I don't think this movie gets enough praise for that. This movie definitely deserves my perfect score. 5/5",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Heavy-handed,"Gratuitous and heavy-handed. It's not that it's without its merit - it's very impressive visually, and a powerful, intense atmosphere is kept throughout. The performances are all terrific too, especially a small but powerful and surprising turn from Winona Ryder. But the plot is predictable and pointless, and the film feels like it's trying way too hard to shock and to create discomfort.None of which is Darren Aronofsky's fault - his directorial work is engrossing and original, and he's still in my book as one of the most promising directors of our times, in the same page as Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson and Chris Nolan. The problem is that after the wonderful maturity of his masterpiece The Wrestler, Black Swan feels like a regression, as it's closer to the heavy manipulation of Requiem for a Dream than The Wrestler's restrained minimalism. I just hope its success won't drive Aronofsky further down that road, and keeps trying much harder than he has to.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
A movie lesson about self-control! (no spoilers),"Black Swan was once again a movie I had on my 2011 Oscar highlights to watch and was also a movie I've looked forward to watching for quite some time. Black Swan is directed by Darren Aronofsky and tells the story of Nina a ballet dancer who tries to prepare as well as she can for an upcoming role while also fearing that she might go insane in the process.This was a terrific movie with a very dramatic story and great suspense. The performances first, are all top notch especially from Natalie Portman who deservedly won the Oscar in 2011. The story is polarizing. On one hand we have the realistic approach with Nina and how she copes with the role she gets, but on the other hand we see a more imaginative world in the movie taking place inside Nina's head while she is going nuts due to her role. This two are perfectly tied into one another mainly by Darren's great direction. There are times when you as an audience feel like Nina not knowing when the reality and when the imagination end and when the other one begins. This makes for a very unpredictable story which kept me involved in the movie until it's very end. Talking about the end, it's very dramatic and the way it was done only with images made me feel so much for it's characters and that is something rare in a movie to make the audience feel emotions only through images without any dialogue whatsoever. The message this movie sends towards its audience is very simple and powerfull at the same time. What would you be capabale of doing in order to fulfil your deam? Would you be willing to let yourself changed into something ugly in order to acheieve that?
Is your profession more important than your life? Would you be able to find the right balance between those two? The cinematography is extremely good in so many moments most of which are close-ups of Nina which makes the viewer more like her most of the time. The score although is more of a nonconformist score integrates very well within the movie and enhances it. The only gripes I might have with the movie is that at some points tries to transmit certain ideas that I for one did not saw them suited for this movie but overall there are a lot more other lesson to be learned from this movie along it's runtime. Another gripe I might have with the movie is that in the beginning Nina's hallucinations are somewhat random and it was hard for me to fandom what was that all about. Aside from that this movie is awesome and powerful and extremely emotional at times.Overall: a great movie with great performances, great story, powerful moments and emotions but at times somewhat polarizing in it's message. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Such a perfect narcissism threat for the audience,"Nina Sayers has just reached the title of new Swan Queen for this bizarre, dark, twisted and nightmarish version of the Swan Lake ballet story, but she is not prepared for what she will become with this new chance in her life as a ballerina, as a woman and, the most important, as a person.This movie is such an incredible masterpiece a I saw a few years ago, and it doesn't stop to surprise me in lots of ways. What Darren Aronofsky has created in this piece of filmmaking is such a rare case of what I could call ""the perfect movie"".However, this movie is the type of film which you will completely love, or you probably are gonna absolutely hate, why?, 'cause its genre is not an easy step for commercial audience (even when the special effects, cinematography and direction makes it great for the marketing). It's like mixing Fight Club with Mulholland Drive, I mean, you are looking at an art-house film with a psycho-sexual story on it. So, if you like these types of films, it's likely for you to love it.The superficial story is not very complex. It does get really messed up and confusing for the viewer but, nothing you would figure out after you've watched it. Nevertheless, when you try to reach for the psychological meaning of it, I mean, when you try to reach its depth, it will become an indomitable monster 'cause it really makes it to have a billion of interpretations on it, but, in my case, that's the best from this!In fact, when you first see Black Swan, you'll probably buy the ""sweet, sexually-repressed girl going deep in darkness for an impossible role in a world where nothing is perfect... blah blah blah"" but, is it really like that? When you absolutely go deep in the story, you will discover lots of terrific things that makes this movie even better than the first time you saw it...In my opinion, when the story takes place, you'll know you are in front of an incredible depiction of a narcissistic artist that destroys the perceptions and identities of the female gender and sexuality, just to expose a new and ""perfect"" (in therms of Aronofsky utopia) woman called ""Black Swan""The ending is the most ambiguous part in the movie, and it will give lots of different interpretations to the whole motion picture.Hope you give this movie a second try, and make it worth it, 'cause saying this movie is about the costs of perfection and how the lead character goes crazy 'cause of that, is like saying Star Wars is about aliens wanting to destroy other aliens... is just plain ridiculous and does not reveal anything new.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Aronofsky Perfectly Mixes Real and Surreal in an Intense Masterpiece,"Ever since I saw the first trailer, I counted down to the day I would watch Black Swan. It has my favorite actresses Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, one of my favorite directors Darren Aronofsky, and ultimately it had the feeling of a David Lynch film. I've tried everything to stay away from any clip, review, or piece of information, even blocking advertisements with my hand on the screen. I was pumped. So pumped the night before seeing it I could barely sleep. With this amount of hype towards anything, it's easy to be disappointed. Black Swan surprised me.First and foremost, the performance Natalie gives is haunting. She always plays the character she began with even when the script demands more and her mental frailty shows throughout Black Swan. She handles every situation with passion and intensity. Mila Kunis also gives her usual performance that always boosts the quality of any film.Having seen all five Aronofsky films to date, I would rank them as:Black Swan > Requiem for a Dream > The Wrestler > The Fountain > PiAll of his movies offer something unique and interesting, but Aronofsky was never able to mix the unique with the realistic as perfectly as he did in Black Swan. This is his best work and, looking at his upcoming work, which in my opinion will underutilized this brilliant director/writer, it will continue to be his best work for years to come.Who knew a film about ballet would be so interesting? The story is brilliant. It's intense, passionate, frightening, sexual, sad, funny, demoniac, romantic, and above all artistic. Everything you could ever want in a film plus more. With that said, I don't believe Black Swan is for everyone, but if you found interest in the trailer than there is a great chance that you will love it as I did. I look forward to watching it again and again in the future. It's THAT good.With a year of massive disappointments, a year where boundary-breaking films were nonexistent, Aronofsky comes in and makes 2010 worthwhile. Black Swan has a safe place as one of my favorites in life. That's right, 'favorites'. It breaks away from being just a film and takes a place as a brilliant memory and piece of work that will stay with me for the rest of my remaining life.",,Anonymous,Drama
Haunting Story of Psychological Breakdown,"Black Swan is one of the best psychological dramas in recent memory. It combines good acting, characterization, metaphor, and even some well placed CGI to convey a ballerina's psychological collapse under the stress of a starring role. Although it is not an entirely original story, it is still a stunning work of art.The acting is the bedrock of the film, with Natalie Portman earning her Oscar for Best Actress. She conveys her character's vulnerability and inner rage equally well. Although the past month has been filled with debate over how much she danced in the film, this really misses the point. (It was an acting, not a choreography award after all.) This will go down as one of Portman's greatest roles.The supporting cast is equally good. Barbara Hershey is excellent as Portman's possessive control freak mother. Mila Kunis expands beyond her usual comic performances as Portman's rival / object of desire, the black swan to her white swan. Even though she has a limited role, Winona Ryder does well as an aging ballerina whose star gives way to Portman's- eerily paralleling the decline of Ryder's career as an ingénue. Ryder is admirably settling into a new role as a character actor.Particularly interesting is Aronofsky's use of CGI to embody Portman's mental breakdown. The film shows that computer graphics are not necessarily the stuff of Transformers movies, as they let the audience see the character's hallucinations.The only reason this review is a nine rather than a ten is that it seems like old territory for Darren Aronofsky. All of his films deal with obsession in some shape or form, ranging from addiction to performance. In particular, the climax seems to borrow heavily from Aronofsky's previous film, The Wrestler, in particular its shooting style.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A Mesmerizing Ballet of Madness and Brilliance, Natalie Portman's Triumph Takes Center Stage","Intriguingly, Black Swan blends hallucination and reality as it explores the quest of perfection in the realm of ballet. Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayers in Darren Aronofsky's picture, which is about a committed dancer who spirals out of control. A career-defining accomplishment, Portman's performance perfectly captures the brittleness and vulnerability of her character. The film's hypnotic appeal is enhanced by its visual and aural components, which include stunning photography and a melancholic soundscape. The ballet scenes heighten the intensity of the movie since they are more than just performances; they are also emotional and psychological expressions. Those who witness Black Swan's eerie, captivating beauty are left with a lasting impression as it delves into themes of identity, obsession, and the price of artistic perfection.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Losing yourself,"Natalie Portman plays Nina, a ballerina in a prestigious New York City company. Nina's toiled away for years, perfecting her craft. She's come a long way, had plenty of success. But she's never made the big breakthrough, never been the lead, the big star. She needs that validation, she's desperate for it. Thomas, the director of the company, announces they will be doing Swan Lake. Nina will get her chance. It's now or never. She needs this part, she needs to be the Swan Queen. Her life is nothing if she fails. The good news is that Nina is absolutely perfect for the part of the innocent, virginal White Swan. The bad news is it's a dual part. Whoever gets the part also has to play the dark, sensual, evil Black Swan. And for this half of the Swan Queen role Nina is all wrong. Can she summon up the darkness inside her? And if she can what will be the cost? Losing herself in this role may well cause her to lose her mind.Thomas knows Nina has the dancing talent to be the Swan Queen. She's up to the task physically. But mentally? Emotionally? That's something else altogether. This sheltered girl, hovered over her whole life by her very, very overprotective mother, has no life experience to draw on to be the Black Swan. Thomas needs her to attack the role but she doesn't know how. Nina's a perfectionist, obsessed with getting all her movements just right. She won't, or can't, allow herself to be swept away, to lose herself in her performance. As an example of what Nina needs to be there is the new dancer in the company, Lily. Everything comes easily to Lily. She's not technically perfect. But she makes dancing look effortless. She connects with the material and the audience in a way Nina can't. Lily is the perfect Black Swan. Thomas sees it. Nina sees it. If Nina is going to be the Swan Queen she'd better find her dark side in a hurry.Becoming the Black Swan is going to require Nina to go to previously uncharted areas of her mind. She's willing to do whatever it takes but she really has no idea of the terribly dark places this might take her. We watch Nina begin to unravel right before our eyes. She's losing it and Portman portrays this wonderfully. A breathtaking performance, helped no doubt by director Darren Aronofsky who captures the descent into madness beautifully. Aronofsky employs some clever visual tricks along the way, notably making wonderful use of all those mirrors ballerinas are constantly studying themselves in. Aronofsky takes us right inside Nina's mind and it turns out that is a very scary place to be. The sweet, young girl we saw in the film's beginning disappears. The Black Swan consumes her. The film isn't perfect. There is a temptation to say that as Nina loses her grip on reality Aronofsky loses his grip on his film. Things do seem to get away from him just a bit in the end. But it's still powerful, fascinating stuff. A great story, performed wonderfully by a stellar cast. Portman obviously gets the lion's share of the attention and deservedly so. She's fantastic from beginning to end in a role that was exceptionally demanding both physically and emotionally. But she's not alone in her brilliance. Vincent Cassel is terrific as Thomas, the man desperately trying to draw the Black Swan out of Nina. Barbara Hershey is the well-meaning but ultimately rather monstrous mother who refuses to let Nina grow up, to truly live. Hershey plays the part perfectly. Winona Ryder has a small but important role as an aging ballerina being pushed aside and Ryder makes the most of every moment she has. Then there's the real revelation, Mila Kunis. She plays Lily and she is stunning in every sense of the word. Very few would have guessed Kunis had something like this in her. Full credit to Aronofsky for giving her the chance. She surely made the most of it. For as good as all the supporting players are there is no doubt this is Portman's show. And she turns in a performance for the ages. Nina is transformed. Portman is too. People will always look at her differently now. She's not just a cute, popular movie star anymore. She's an actress of the highest caliber. Black Swan may not be a truly great movie, but it's a very good one. If greatness eludes the movie it doesn't elude Portman. The performance she turned in here is as good as it gets.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Amazing,"This movie is pure art, and Natalie is just perfect, Mila is not my favorite tough, and Winona...well I would have liked to see her in a stronger role.Natalie have been always a favorite of mine, I mean she is great in ""The professional"", Closer and even Star wars, so this movie was her destiny, she actually looks like a beautiful swan, and she can represent this dark notes of the character. It was cool to see Toby Hemingway but his role...well not to exciting, he is a great actor and they could use him in a better and juicy way.The last sequence is dramatic and dark but i really didn't like the end, is kinda flat, i mean the final dance and the blood in the stomach is great, but Natalie just resting in the floor is not enough.In general Natalie is gorgeous just as her acting, the script, photography, music and clothes is a perfect 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Beautiful, touching and mind-blowing","This piece presents us a nude and raw vision of human beings obsessions, bringing a study that comes to scare us at night. Aronofsky's films usually prevent us from sleeping and this one don't walk away from this reality. 
Lead by strong and confident performances - especially from Natalie Portman - the movie portraits the image of a woman thread by her own talent and find herself trapped into a hunting for perfection. The editing make easy to believe that she's going insane at the same time that the audience have no idea of what's going on. That brings us to the higher point of the movie, the directing. Full of imaginative chops and claustrophobic close-ups on Portman's face, making who's watching to feel her agony and despair. 
Even full of traumatizing moments, the film never forget to be sexy and provocative, evoking the audience to it biggest tension, especially at the final dance presentations which shows the ultimate directing skills of Aronofsky - well-deserved Oscar nomination - and take off our breathing. 
A masterpiece from beginning to end, and definitivally a must-see movie. Go watch and lose your mind.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A fantastic movie that is as much about ballet as ""The Wrestler"" was about wrestling. Very dark, disturbing and great. I say A","How far would you go to be perfect? After her lifelong dream of being the lead in a ballet, Nina (Portman) finally gets her chance. Pushing herself as hard as she can, she becomes so absorbed in the role it changes her life. This is a difficult movie to review without giving too much away. I can say that this is not your typical ballet movie. This is the same director of ""Requiem For A Dream"" and that should tell you what type of film this is. I would call this a borderline horror movie, and there are equal parts sex and blood as there is dancing. Lily (Kunis) plays the Yin to Nina's Yang and the movie is better because of the two sides coming together. The director did the near impossible with this movie, a ballet movie that guys will really enjoy. I honestly can't say enough good things about this movie, or the the performances. Portman deservedly won the Oscar, and the fact that Kunis was snubbed in a big injustice. If you don't want to watch this because of the ballet, keep in mind that it is only a part of the movie. It is more of a trippy thriller than anything, a very good and well done movie. You will not be disappointed. I give it an A.Would I watch again? - Yes, I would. This is a movie that you will be able to catch different things each time you watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Suspiria,"Aronofsky's 'Black Swan' (2010) is a psychological thriller that recalls the finest of Italian 'Giallo.' It's rare for a film these days to actually be frightening, with most contemporary horror flicks aiming to be merely repulsive; assaulting the viewer instead of seducing them.Like Dario Argento's 'Suspiria', 'Black Swan' is essentially a fairy-tale for adults. Argento's stylistic flourishes, both psychological and visual, permeate 'Black Swan'. The lethal eroticism of sharp-edged objects, a virginal heroine in the thrall of suppressed sexuality, story largely set in a theater, windows and mirrors as portals into the subconscious, lesbianism, secret societies, occultism.Aronofsky has acknowledged there are similarities between the anime 'Perfect Blue' and his film 'Black Swan. However I think 'Black Swan' would make a great triple bill with 'Suspiria' and Argento's 'Opera'. Aronofsky was also attached the remake of 'Suspiria' for a few years.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
8/10,"A film about ballet should glide: graceful, poised, effortless. Black Swan does not. Instead, it stumbles, pirouettes into madness, and fractures under the weight of perfection. And therein lies its brilliance. Darren Aronofsky crafts a psychological horror that is as delicate as it is brutal, mirroring the art it portrays. The film pulses with tension, every frame trembling between beauty and destruction.Natalie Portman's Nina is a study in obsession, a dancer consumed by her own mind. The camera lingers on her, uncomfortably close, as she unravels in a performance that is both masterful and deeply unsettling. The silence, when it comes, is deafening, making every strained breath, every creaking floorboard, a note in the symphony of her breakdown. Sound is not an accompaniment here; it is a tool uses meticulously, shaping the film's suffocating atmosphere. Mental illness is often mishandled in cinema, reduced to caricature or spectacle. Black Swan refuses such simplifications. Nina's descent is not externalised in grand gestures but felt in subtle shifts, glimpses of shadowed figures, fleeting moments of body horror, the impossible weight of expectation. The film does not seek to diagnose her; it immerses us in her psyche, forcing the audience to question what is real. And yet, despite its psychological torment, the film remains hypnotic, impossibly chic, its aesthetic drenched in ballet's cold elegance. It is a film of contrasts: of beauty and grotesquery, discipline and madness. The final moments are inevitable yet devastating, a perfect crescendo to a film that thrives on its own contradictions. Plot is lovely, genuinely intriguing. A masterpiece of unease, Black Swan does not ask to be understood. It demands to be felt.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

She is told to loosen up by having sex, and so the frigid little princess goes home and masturbates.

Low Entertainment Value,"I was unlucky enough to take a chance on this movie. The good is that Natalie Portman gives an Oscar worthy performance. The bad is that this movie is so intense it is frequently painful to watch.

Fortunately, many are excellent. Although this film was very well made and had excellent direction, it has very low entertainment value.The one high point of the movie was near the end when Natalie performs as the Black Swan. But this is not worth the price of admission. As is sometimes the case, movies that don't entertain get very high critical reviews. What is surprising to me is that user's gave this movie such a high score.

Didn't rock my world,"I cannot even try to add to the plethora of posts critiquing this film. I can simply say the things which would have made this film great in my opinion.I've seen a couple of people mention Mulholland drive and David Lynch. I only wish the director could have gone down this route a little more. There is a scene where she is training alone and the lights go off. She walks on stage into a shot which could have been taken directly from Mulholland drive, later she she goes backstage where two people are getting it on (imagined or not, I don't know). This scene worked very well. The director does not have the ability to pace and film a scene like Lynch, who can make a tension absoulute.It does become a sort of cliché fest. Inevitably we have to follow and follow. No surprises with the conclusion of the film, I think most of us knew she was suffering from multiple personalities. Perhaps the director could think outside of the box, that he has already thought outside of.All in all a pleasant unpleasant experience, but it did not rock my world or my foundations.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

A scary and unique movie. Well done but not amazing.,"This movie was very well done and unique. It had many cinematic elements that I have not seen before in a movie. That said, I was with two ladies- 25 and 24 years old- and many times during the movie they were unable to watch the screen. One of the ladies actually had a rash because she was so scared. So this is a warning, this movie is disturbing and strange and a lot of people will find it scary and unwatchable.Natalie Portman is great in the movie. She looks hot and it is very scandalous. There are very graphic and suggestive scenes and if you want to see hot girls acting naughty this flick might float your boat. I personally thought the film was very well done. It was unique and interesting. Natalie Portman did a great job portraying the dark and light aspects of human nature and the complex interaction that can exist within our heads.Overall the movie was worth seeing but I would not watch it again. I thought it was cool, but it didn't leave much of a lasting impression. Although, I do refer to my girlfriend as the Swan Queen often and I flap my arms around like the ballerinas. So I guess something changed in my life because of the movie. Maybe that is enough for me to recommend you seeing it.Whatever you decide. Stay classy!",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Intellectual Canary in the Coalmine,"One thought occurred to me as this movie flailed and writhed out of control: the intellectual life of the United States is in deep, deep trouble. When this movie is the best that Hollywood has to offer anymore--and it IS head and shoulders above most movies coming out of Hollywood--then the world of (American) mainstream film is circling the drain in a very tight orbit, indeed.This movie is the story of an anal-retentive dancer who has (under a lifetime of jealous pressure from her ex-dancer mother) become so obsessed with the idea of ""perfection"" that it has become intertwined with her quasi-lesbian sexuality. She displaces her resentment of her mother and her own flaws and repressed sexuality onto a lover/rival dancer and incorporates all of this psychological flotsam and jetsam into her upcoming role as the Black Swan in ""Swan Lake."" That all sounds very highbrow and interesting, I know, but I'm doing my very best to be diplomatic, here, and it really isn't.The worst problem with this movie is the use of insultingly obvious special effects to explain to the dumb kids in the audience what is going on.""Look! She's looking at HERSELF in another person!"" ""Look! Her legs are bending like a SWAN's! And she has WINGS!"" ""Look! Her rival is having sex with the Swan Prince!"" And so on.I'm of two very different minds on this movie. On the one hand, it's well-made. The lighting and scene composition are really exquisite. The special effects are spectacular. Some of the acting is even passable, though Natalie Portman lurches around like a mental patient on Thorazine.The problem is that the plot is dreadful. It's hypersexual, unrealistically nasty and full of embarrassing clichés. The ballet director--and I'm not making this up--is an oversexed Frenchman who calls ""his"" girls things like ""Little Princess."" It really reminded me of ""Showgirls"" a lot. Ooh! Right! I got it! If you want a summary of this movie, here it is: Imagine ""Showgirls."" Now imagine that ""Showgirls"" has completed 30 hours of master's work in cinema and just drank a pot of coffee and was in the mood to talk. Except, instead of strippers, imagine ballet dancers. That's ""Black Swan.""GRADE: C-. Things to look for: Winona Ryder chewing scenery, sudden lesbian sex, the director loses his mind.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama

Classical music versus classic psychoanalytic theory,"Sometimes the conception of art can be everything. Every artist approaches the subject in a unique way, and there is never a right or wrong option. Some alternatives, however, can lead to self-destructive behaviors (consequently, the image of the tormented artist has been tremendously popular in the past).Darren Aranofsky's latest film deals with art and the delicate balance between Eros and Thanatos. As Sigmund Freud wrote in some of his books, the vital drive and the death drive are forces that coexist in each one of us. Nina, the protagonist, though, finds out that sometimes it's nearly impossible to regain a sense of selfness after such different and opposite forces menace to pull her apart.Nina has a deep devotion for ballet. Her whole emotional stability seems to depend on being selected for the main role for the upcoming ballet production. She is a superb ballerina but her director constantly criticizes her for being too rigid, too cold, too passionless. What lies underneath her unruffled expression? What's beneath all that control and perfection of movement? Only neurosis, I'd dare to claim.If life and death are the most relevant aspects as some philosophers might affirm, then one could easily find a connection between sexual impulses and the vital drive. But what would occur when the pulse of nature is denied? What happens when sexual activity is not only disregarded but put off altogether? Freud did a thorough analysis of his time and he reached one daunting conclusion, which was quite polemic back then: sexual repression always leads to neurosis.Nina's director can easily spot the uptightness of the future star. She is not only tense, she is afraid of her own body, of her own sexuality. Perhaps one could identify Nina's mother as the source of all evils. It has been said before that it's so easy to blame everything on the parents that one should look for other possibilities. This case, however, proves that parental influence can be most detrimental. With a mother that watches over her daughter constantly, controlling her and treating her like a child, it's only foreseeable to understand how this will affect Nina.When Nina's mother undresses her or sleeps in the same bedroom, the viewer may be shocked at the lack of privacy, but perhaps what is more shocking is the passive response of the protagonist. It should be understandable, then, to see those repressed feelings surmounting the mental barriers she has put into place; in fact, after certain events Nina will even fantasize about the possibility of engaging in a lesbian affair of most physical nature.There is much suspense throughout the film, and the constant supernatural visions of intrusions of the ominous can take us back, again, to the Freudian unheimlich: quotidian activities or mundane locations are infused with something that might be real but at the same time defies possibility, thus instilling apprehension and anxiety in people. Nina will experience something similar, but in a much more frightful manner. The very first scene sets the tone for these dark and ominous moments.Art is creation, but it can also be destruction. At moments it would look as if Nina won't be able to resist the pressure, and the constant visions she seems to have might be seen as proof of her weak psychological condition. She could crumble at any moment as things heat up. Surrounded by envious ballerinas, sieged by her director, betrayed by the only girl she could call friend, Nina will soon find out that true artistic creation requires absolute passion and commitment to survive the experience. And thus, finally, the viewers come to realize what is the ultimate conception of art in Nina's mind.",,Anonymous,Drama
Hard to Recommend - Hard Not To.,"What can I say, I had a negative experience watching this story and couldn't wait for it to end. The critical mass has established that this film is a masterpiece. It would be fruitless for me to argue otherwise. The acting, especially Barbara Hershey, is believable. The editing is brisk. The direction is done well. It is the story, not even the subsequent screenplay, that feels uneven. The character arc is more a straight line than an arc.The confusion the main character is going through leaves no grounding for the audience from the beginning to the end. This constant uncertainty and frustrating tension just made the story an unpleasant experience. Portman is shown constantly throwing up and crying. There was no escape for her or the audience throughout the 1 hour and 40 minutes of the world of professional ballet. Again, the movie features very little actual ballet, which could also disappoint cultural moviegoers who expect some artistic gratification. I actually found the scenes of repetitive practice realistic in comparison to my own life, spending years practicing piano. There was some insight to the behind the scenes world of professional ballet, but that also felt to be not enough to fill an entire screenplay.I started to really lose it in the third act, where instead of watching a character study, I felt like I switched the channel and was watching a David Cronenberg film. Natalie Portman is literally turning into a black swan like Jeff Goldblum was literally turning into ""The Fly"". Then this drama about depression and living in stress tries to become a thriller or horror film, setting up your classic horror shocks with loud sound effects and creepy faces in shadows. Again, my complaint was - what I am as an audience member supposed to feel? The only moment of growth I felt, other than the obvious finale, is when Portman finally stands up to her overbearing mother, and even then we still can find sympathy for the Mother's devotion. Barbara Hershey was perfectly cast as the former ballerina mother with her own sordid past. Darren Aronofsky found the right balance of mania versus reality in the film's presentation, and kept me guessing to the end. However, in the end it saddened me to have such a depressing experience watching a well made film.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
The strive for perfection ends in devastation,"Reading reviews of Black Swan online made me come to a logical consensus; you either love it, or hate it. There is really no in between. If so you're leaning to one side. The film is definitely an art film. I saw a poster for this a while back as it proudly displays it's selected showings at The Toronto Film Festival and Venice 2010. Once I saw those two little messages on opposite sides of the poster I knew that one, this was a serious film, and two, it's likely to get some Oscar nominations. Junior film critic intuition.Black Swan was nominated for Best Picture, Best Actress (Natalie Portman), and Best Director. Sadly, it found itself a bit neglected compared to hefty competition with The King's Speech and The Social Network. At least Portman was recognized for her unique and thrilling role as Nina Sayers, a ballet dancer working at a stunning academy in New York City.The director Thomas (Cassel) chooses Nina to be the white swan in the retelling of Swan Lake. Nina is thrilled to have the job, but she feels held back and forced into a box she can't fit into by her controlling and strict mother (Hershey). Nina's mom was an aspiring dancer, but failed to get to the level of fame and is now forcing her daughter to do what she couldn't do. She clearly wants the best, but not in the right way.The pressure but on Nina is relenting and makes her have strange, unexplainable hallucinations and anxiety levels of high calibers. She is almost on the verge of going insane. She strives to be perfect, but at the same time she's up on a pedestal her mom and she herself know she can't live up to. It's a sad state of affairs for this poor women.The cinematography and especially the music is extraordinary and very vibrant. The score is gripping and is easily the best soundtrack composed for any film in 2010. Natalie, excuse me, Oscar Winner Natalie Portman gives an electrifying performance and documents the struggle will full seriousness. She had that Oscar in the bag before the nominations came out.Mila Kunis is brilliant here as well. I have called Kunis an amazing woman of beautiful looks and now I can call her one of beautiful looks and major talent. Not like she didn't have talent before this film, she just never got to showcase it like she did in this film.Director Darren Aronofsky knew where he wanted to take Black Swan - above and beyond expectations. It's a film not only worthy of the Best Picture win, but a movie that should've had a wider release and more mainstream promotion. The acting, the screenplay, music, lighting, plot, etc is outstanding and some of the best 2010 has to offer.As for ""the scene"" with Portman and Kunis I wasn't all amused or aroused. I'm not a fan of lesbian sex scenes in any film. Horror, comedy, or melodrama it isn't the kind of thing I like to watch. The film Bitch Slap was great exploitation, but the continuous lesbian love scene was too long and almost soiled the film and what it had going for it. While it's not meant for the reason it appears, Black Swan knows when to start it and when to stop it.When it comes to ballet movies, the few and far between, there are only a selected number of people who like ballet let alone the ones who want to see it on film. I admit I probably never would've seen Black Swan if it wasn't up for nominations. But I was attracted to the film when Kunis's name appeared on the poster, but could never find a theater near me that played it. I didn't even know the plot to the film and still was interested.The less you know going into see Black Swan, the better.Starring: Natalie Portman. Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, and Barbara Hershey.

Monstrous elegance,"In typical genre-jumbling style, Darren Aronofsky's fifth feature contains elements of sports drama, horror and operatic romance. The result is a fraught, frightening film about the pursuit of perfection; one that does not concern itself with the experience of watching ballet, but rather the various forms of violence that go into preparing for and performing it.Nina (Natalie Portman) is chosen by Thomas (Vincent Cassel) to be the Black and White Swans in his re-imagining of Swan Lake. She effortlessly embodies the elegance and fragility of the former role, but can she delve into her dark side, and nail the latter? The arrival of Lily (Mila Kunis), all sensuality and laissez-faire, not to mention a whole bunch of talent, triggers a vicious rivalry and sets Nina's inner runaway train down the tracks.A lesser film may have focused on the suggestion that the whole dreadful rivalry may be some twisted training device masterminded by the ""genius"", Thomas. But Aronofsky wisely focuses on the most interesting characters - not Nina and Lily, but Nina and Nina. The fact that Nina is evidently unhinged from the first frame lends the film a slightly monotone quality. But it's far, far from predictable.That the pursuit presents a path to derangement will not come as a surprise to fans of the director's debut, Pi, while fans of Requiem for a Dream will find the escalating, claustrophobic chaos of the later scenes familiar. Aronofsky seems most at home when he's commanding an anarchic narrative through a warped aesthetic. This probably explains why his most grounded film, The Wrestler, which most closely resembles the real world - as opposed to the world as seen through his protagonist's eyes - feels the least his own.Black Swan is a deserved Oscar contender (if you believe in that sort of thing) and the work of a consistently impressive auteur.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Black, Bleak Swan","Black Swan is a heavy, dark look at a specific ballet company going through the machinations of casting and putting on a show. Portman is competent and a basically solid actress, but I think her performance here feels a bit one dimensional as a tormented, seemingly perpetually unhappy and neurotic character (although she does perform those emotions quite well which is why she won an Oscar for this performance). The Mila Kunis character enter the film as a bit of fresh air and nice contrast to Portman's character. Flawed and a bit slow at time, Black Swan does still manage to deliver enough to make it worth checking out for those of you with an interest.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

The immaturity, envy and fear were so beautifully acted out.I won't talk much about the plot as one only has to watch it to appreciate it, but this movie comes a full circle with it's entire plot and easter eggs planted throughout the movie.All in all, this was a complete movie and the kind anyone who appreciates art and psychological thrillers should not miss.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Do you believe ballet can drive people crazy?,"This movie is beyond my expectation. What I mean is, I believe those who love to watch exciting movie like Fast and Furious or Star Wars can enjoy watching it undoubtedly. Too often watching some movies received Academy Award nomination is a snooze fest, especially ones in which actors or actresses are free to demonstrate their acting skills. Black Swan, however, is not a tedious movie at all. Even if you are not interested in ballet, you still can have fun watching it because the movie puts less emphasis on ballet. And I want to suggest that those who don't like thriller and bloody movies should not watch it.Well runs a saying that there is a fine line between genius and insanity. Too often it takes great pains to pursuit and achieve perfection for a artist. This movie presents the process in which Natalie Portman, as a ballerina, wants to dance the Swan Lake to perfection and shoulders a great deal of responsibility and, of course, stress that eventually drives her crazy. At first, I regard the movie as a B movie or a cult because in many scenes some horrible objects or elements jump out at me out of the blue; Nevertheless, the psychological condition of the Nina as well as the lamentable yet reasonable ending appeals to me. After watching it, I still cannot distinguish reality from virtuality, just like another brilliant movie, Shutter Island, which put audience in Nina's place, experiencing paranoia and lunacy together with her. Choosing ballet, which seems a graceful performance, to be the theme for interpreting repression, thriller and crazy is a perfect idea for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Commands your every bit of attention.,"Black Swan is the type of film most moviegoers won't want to see until they hear from a select few how good it really is. On the surface, it appears to be a simple overwrought, art-house wannabe that strains to be important and ends up being self-aware and arrogant. Oh, how people can be wrong.Everything you may think this film is, it very well may not be. From the opening sequence, a beautifully crafted, unbroken shot of a young woman and man dancing the White Swan from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, Darren Aronofsky's bold and insatiable tale never lets the audience's attention go. This is not simply a story about the pressures of professional ballerinas and their tendency to get caught up in their work. This is a thrilling, engaging psychological drama that plays with POV and omniscient narrator. We don't know what is happening because Nina Sayers doesn't.So much can be said about this film, what it represents and how those themes are addressed. Yet, perhaps the best way to review this film is to simply try to encourage potential viewers to leave their logic and reason at home and try to get wrapped up in this story through its bold acting and wildly arresting visuals. Natalie Portman is the odds-on favorite to win the Best Actress Oscar next month and though I haven't seen the other potential nominee's work, I can certainly see why she might. Her screen presence is astounding; very few actresses can convey so many different emotions and feelings at once. She begins as an innocent, child-like dancer completely dominated by her mother (Barbara Hershey) and the theater director (Vincent Cassel). Both demand the very best of her and push until, they hope, she performs with no restraint. This pressure pushes Nina to the brink, and to watch her journey there is the true aspiration of this film with Portman boldly leading the way in a style all her own. Supporting her are Hershey doing a nice, subtle job as the ex-ballerina now attempting to find success through her daughter, Cassel as the sexually domineering director who uses sex and other forms of seduction to get the best of his performers, and Mila Kunis in yet another great supporting role that hopefully pushes her through into the realm of lead actress. Playing the dichotomy of Nina, Lily is a free-spirited, charming and loose dancer not so concerned about success as living. The interaction between these two is mesmerizing.Aronofsky has been known for most of his career has a visual master. Films like Requiem For a Dream, The Fountain and The Wrestler all dealt with harsh imagery that stays with the audience after the film ends and Black Swan is no different; it might be his best work yet. Shot in the same style as The Wrestler with a lot of extreme closeups, grainy quality and hand-held camera work, Aronofsky gives the film an off-kilter feeling that is all the more stunning and surprising at the climax. I could continue trying to conjure up words to describe the awesome and enthralling power this film has, but that would be futile. Black Swan is a dazzling, incredibly provocative and mind-bending tale with powerful performances, glorious sets, vividly dark cinematography and breathless direction that brings it all to its rightful conclusion. Hopefully the success of this film ensures Aronofsky for years to come; he is a bright spot amidst the darkness that enshrouds American cinema today.",,Anonymous,Drama

Black Swan: Interesting and Intelligent,"Hailed by many as a modern art masterpiece, nominated for awards aplenty, and benefiting from a series of rather beautiful posters, Black Swan was the first of the current Oscar bait pieces I was reeled in by.An aspiring ballet dancer since her childhood, Nina Sayers is eager to be chosen for the lead role in her company's presentation of Swan Lake. The demanding role requires her to perform as both the white and black swans, the latter of which she is less well equipped to do. The competition from fellow dancer Lily, the restrictions of her overprotective mother, and strange marks on her back are just some of the oddities that begin to plague Nina as she trains.The film begins, as it quite appropriately ought to, with a ballet sequence, the first of many. Perhaps ignorantly, I was slightly fearful of being overrun by an excess of such scenes, my general cynicism toward dance and the like making itself known in the back of my head. Such fears were, and are, entirely unwarranted. In its opening scene, Black Swan demonstrates beautifully the complex combination of cinematography, choreography, and performance which combine so well to create scenes of near dazzling effulgence even to the most hardened of sceptics. The first of these is also the most appealing, its grandeur revealed quickly to be a dream of our protagonist. Nina is portrayed wonderfully by Portman, the quiet fragility she brings to the character eliciting sympathy every step of the way, her apologetic passivity difficult not to sympathise with. Cassel too gives a fine performance, his sexually suspect instructor suitably imposing and creepy. Despite their mutual proficiency, these performances are both towered over by Hershey in her maternal role, one of the film's very strongest facets. Strong too is Aronofsky's use of mise-en-scène, the placement of mirrors throughout the film and the stark contrast between black and white which pervades its every scene working well with the general idea of duality which the film examines. This is, however, a little overstated by the end, the constancy of the monochrome and mirror effect becoming eventually an irritant through overuse. Subtlety seems an alien concept to the film, tarnishing slightly its otherwise wonderful art direction. Nevertheless, the film tackles its primary theme well, utilising the aforementioned visual cues to reinforce the narrative itself. Of the narrative, a quick complaint must be made. After an approximate eighty minutes of slow, contemplative, atmospheric building of tension and suspense, Aronofsky turns it all up to eleven and throws everything at us. Though it does little to detract from the overall effect of the film, it feels very sudden and tonally different from what came before, quite probably deliberately but unfortunately rather amusingly—not a feeling it should evoke.Though its interesting and intelligent art direction is somewhat marred by its blatancy, Black Swan is a visually interesting piece, communicating certain ideas via its lighting and mise-en-scène ever before doing so via its narrative. Not as strong as it potentially could have been, and delving less deep into its central theme than perhaps it should, one wonders to what extra-narrative end, if any, the film has been envisioned. Though far too accelerated in its finale's insanity, the film is an entertaining work, visually appealing, and populated with interesting, well-articulated characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Silly movie,"Natalie Portman spends much of the movie flapping her stiff arms in an artsy ballet rehearsal room. She has been made to appear anorectic, what may have earned her an Oscar taking into consideration the fact that she had had her head shaved for another movie previously. Painful to watch the transitions from her sticky frame to a dancer body double and back again. Good intentions galore but you cannot make a ballet movie when the star is not a trained dancer. Hollywood may wish to believe so, and there will be a few viewers to agree, but in the end this is too embarrassing to watch. Skinny Natalie Portman looks wistful in facial closeups, passable in full body shots, but she is just plain awful from the neck down. And her arm flapping is just comical.

More psycho than sexual,"On the cover, this is called a ""psychosexual thriller."" It is far more psycho than sexual, I found it difficult to watch in time units greater than 20 minutes. Natalie Portman stars as Nina, a ballerina that is extremely talented, but even more unstable. She tries out for the lead role in ""Swan Lake"" to be performed by the New York Ballet company. Vincent Cassel plays the intense, hard-driving artistic director, pushing Nina hard. He even engages in what is clearly sexual harassment in his attempts to get Nina to rise to the level of a star. It is clear that sex is not his goal, his mind is on the ballet. Nina lands the role, yet she has not a moment of peace from that point on.
It is clear early in the film that Nina suffers from a serious case of mental illness, she lives with her mother and her mother is not the most stable of individuals. There are many times in the movie where there is action where the viewer is uncertain whether it is real or a wild vision in Nina's mind. All are resolved, but they are very intense and really creepy. At one point, it seems likely that Nina is going to murder her mother. It has been some time since I watched a movie that gave me cold chills, there were many in this one. It is a movie that will make nightmares and it is about ballet, which is somewhat of an odd thought.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Portrait of a breakdown,"I put off watching this movie for years, for personal reasons. Finally gave it a spin today, and all I can say is wow.

I don't know if they shot on actual film or if they just consciously tried to emulate it, but it has a look to it that harkens back to a different era. The sets, pace, and character development are reflective of older eras of film making.I must admit I never thought Natalie Portman was a great actress until now. She felt very wooden (Star Wars) or put into pigeon holed roles that weren't very challenging (manic pixie dream girls). But holy crap, her work in this movie proved me wrong. She is pitch perfect as the mentally fragile perfectionist Nina. When she becomes the Black Swan, you can see the transition in her body language and dancing. She just nailed it.

Bloody special effects are shocking and although perhaps accurate in respect to the mental illness, still disconcerting in the extreme. There were a few things that jumped out as not true to a dance company's standards nor procedures. The character Portman plays would not have been dressing herself.

Absorbing and Captivatingly Brilliant,"2 January 2011. Perhaps the best movie of 2010, this psychological drama set in the ballet milieu presents the audience with a brilliant, striking, haunting and intense personal drama of one female ballerina's attempt to be the lead in Swan Lake. Natalie Portman, as Nina, must contend with her own inhibitions and fears as the audience must confront their own prejudices and bias regarding movie character stereotypes. In many ways, Nina's journey parallels many of our own fears and imagined monsters. With only three apparent possible editing or directorial alternatives (the selection of the female lead and the biting of the mouth timing, the shot selection for the perceptual view of the rehearsing (unlike Chorus Line), and the murder scene that didn't seem to quite have the clarity of character persona transformation and credibility), this amazing personal almost mature David Lynch-like presentation makes Blawk Swan a voyage of discovery and layered emotional and psychological density the most absorbing, powerful movie of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

More importantly, I have seen the film characterized in a number of ways in other reviews or summaries. There seems to be a consistent pattern of declarative statements being made about characters in the film in areas where the movie is ambiguous. One of the reasons I LIKE the film is because you can't be sure where reality ends and Nina's drug/pressure-induced imaginings begin.

"""Scream"" if you're feeling pretentious","Like ""Requiem for a Dream"", also by Darren Aronofsky, ""Black Swan"" is superficial entertainment masquerading as profound psychological analysis. It's stylish, it has the kind of ""scary"" effects that belong in a teen slasher movie, it is often gross, and it doesn't go anywhere. Which would be okay, if this were an actual teen slasher movie. But it isn't. The Black Swan is humorless and pretentious, and to make matters worse, it's intellectually dishonest. Only a very cynical director would use symptoms of auto-mutilation, anorexia and schizophrenia haphazardly as ""devices"" to freak out an audience. (Not to mention the mandatory lesbian sex scene!)Portman, an actress I've always considered to be somewhat of a quality assurance, delivers her worst role here, looking flat and freaked out for 100 minutes. High-stakes ballet is a stressful environment, but every great performer loses that stress on stage. Not the Portman character. She gets the main role without any hint she can handle it. Or was it all supposed to be one big hallucination?I guess I should draw my own conclusions: I'm not a fan of Aronofsky.

One of the few perfect films.,"Nina suffers from multiple different psychological disorders, she shows signs of, Generalised anxiety disorder, Obsessive-compulsive disorder, Panic disorder and Social anxiety disorder. The reason I find this film so disturbing is because it shows, in such a raw way, how mental health disorders can affect somebody so dramatically, somebody who seems fine to everyone around her. I struggle with both Generalized anxiety disorder and Social anxiety disorder and really appreciate how Darren Aronofsky depicts mental health in such a realistic way.Nina is a 28 year old woman, but is treated like a child by her mother. Her mother is extremely controlling. She does not let Nina stay out late, she puts Nina to bed at night then gets her dressed in the morning. Nina's relationship with her mother has clearly been taking its toll on her for years but she was never taught to stand up for herself, all she knows how to do is take the constant abuse from everyone. Obviously the lack of real life experience, lack of independence, lack of confidence, lack of social skills also takes its toll on Nina and all of this stems from her mother.The music and dance in this film are just phenomenal. Music is one of my passions and the score is magnificent and so is the music accompanying the dance. I'm not a fan of ballet but watching it in this film was so thoroughly entertaining. The dance is presented in such a beautiful way but these scenes still give you the feeling that it is physically, mentally and emotionally very taxing.Technically every aspect is masterful. The cinematography is so phenomenal, especially during the final sequence, the great set design makes this a much easier task than it could have been.

Dreams go to Camp,"There is a well-known dream that so many people all over the world have experienced. It goes like this: you arrive to school to take a test that you never studied for.... or you never even showed up for class! Or you come to school naked. Yup, you show up at school one day, you are about to enter the school, but then you realize (to your horror) that you are naked. Or you don't have your pants on.There are variations on the dream. One is ""The Actor's Nightmare."" You are about to go on stage in front of an audience, and you have never read the play. You forgot to show up for rehearsals.Of course the dream is completely unreal. Nobody could have just realized they were completely naked as they enter the school. No director would allow you to go on stage if you never showed up for rehearsal.But in the dream, that is what happens. Really. You really did show up naked or not knowing your lines.Now, we are all familiar with Fables. Like the Tortoise and the Hare. The tortoise and the hare race against each other. Is it a true story? I doubt it. But is that what really happens in the fable? Oh yes, in the fable they really do race against each other.There is a reason that so many people all over the world share the same dream. It is an unreal situation, but there are emotional and intellectual truths revealed by the dream. In the case of the Actor's Nightmare, it is about feelings of unpreparedness. Or inadequacy.In the fable, we learn how slow and steady can win the race.Black Swan is a phantasmagorical fable. Phantasmagorical = a swift series of dream images. I won't go into any detail of what happens in the movie. Suffice it to say that some really weird things happen.It is very likely for people to think of Black Swan as a movie about an insane girl, or hallucinations, or schizophrenia. Certainly, I thought of that at the beginning. It's hard not to.However, as the story unfolds I realized that the entire story is a fable.It is not a film about madness or that it takes insanity to create art. Or even some kind of Fight Club doppelganger. Everything in this story is unreal, yet it happens. Just like in a dream. Or in a fable.And just as in those dreams and fables, there are emotional and intellectual truths to discover in Black Swan.The movie is about a young woman who leads a child-like existence. No matter how technically skilled a ballerina she is, she will never become the artist she wants to be and remain the simpering child.This is a coming of age story.Yes, there are many themes. it gets very complicated. And every scene of the movie is nightmarish. There is a lot to think about in this movie, and a lot to laugh about. Yeah, I not only liked the movie, but I also found it bombastic, ridiculous, and preposterous. However, as events came to their conclusion, I was amazed by the way the director coalesced all his thoughts into a rather powerful, stunning package.So I found it to be a work of bravura.

"""The only person standing in your way is YOU""","Nina (Natalie Portman) is a ballerina who wins the lead role of Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake"", Nina suffers from multiple different psychological disorders that lead her to madness and losing control of her life.Black Swan is one of the most amazing psychological horror films I have ever seen, the film is so strong and accurate in many different things.Natalie Portman's performance as Nina was unbelievable, she was able to express the madness, the innocence, and the loss of control of Nina in a shocking way, her facial expressions and eyes were saying it all in some way, great choice and for sure deserves an Oscar and a Golden Globe win.
The supporting cast was great too and it was there to kind of ""complete"" Portman's great performance, Vincent Cassel as Thomas Leroy was perfect and Vincent always puts a great/powerful performance, Mila Kunis surprised me as Lily, she was able to give us that Black Swan (Evil) version in a perfect way. Winona Ryder as Beth Macintyre or ""The Dying Swan"" was good but unfortunately, her role was not big at all, really wished if we could've seen her more.The movie used the colors Black & White, as its theme in such a creative way and to present good & evil or darkness & innocence, what I mean by using black & white as the movie's theme is for example the set design, the set design was in plain black & white sometimes to represent the environment of the movie and what is going on, and the custom designs too sometimes. Loved also how the movie seems so dark as if we (the audience) are Nina.
The movie used ""reflection"" in many different deep ways like in mirrors and sometimes in others.The movie's runtime was perfect, usually psychological horror movies are more than 2 hours but this one was less than 1h 50m witch was a perfect thing, it made the movie full of powerful scenes and not boring at all, for me the movie was great from beginning to end although it was building the story and the transformation of Nina in a very slow way, but with all of that it was still great and not boring.The music and dance moves in the film were entertaining, the ballet dances were so entertaining to watch, and the way that the movie represented them were absolutely pure and beautiful, especially that last scene when Nina was performing in ""Swan Lake"" I was so entertained and the way the movie ended and everything was so cool.Black Swan is a must watch and a movie that will entertain you from beginning to end, highly recommend this great physiological horror film.My rating is: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Flawed Premise Executed With Finesse,"'The Black Swan' is a flawed piece of work, albeit executed with honesty, commitment and vision. It is like a great football match played on a basketball court; a ballet dancer's life becoming ballistic is believable but not when she has the top spot already.Nina Sayers is a committed, technical ballet dancer who believes in perfecting all her moves to be perfect. She faces the harshest adversity in herself when she has to play something she is not, or rather something she believes she isn't. It is not the unthinkable to conceive of such a plot; usually actors do face this challenge in real life when they are given parts contradictory to their personalities. They opt for different routes to bring out the personality in them – some empathize with their characters by putting themselves in their situation, some do the lazy and easiest but less satisfying job of 'acting' it out externally while some begin to rediscover themselves. Nina Sayers, who has to tackle both the white swan and the black, for her role of Swan Queen, chooses the third route, which itself comes as a surprise since she believes so much in technique and prettiness, I thought she could've faked it with external expressions. But she is pushed to the limits by her tough artistic director, Thomas, who employs sexual methods to invoke some stimulus from the actors. Also she fears she may not live up to her role, and disappoint the audience and the previous swan queen Beth. Fear of being replaced by Lily, the alternate, haunts her while pressure from her embittered mother strains her. Nina's gradual discovery of the blackness within her threatens to obliterate the goodness and purity that she believes she has retained throughout her life. Her contrived existence becomes a narcissistic one which ultimately culminates in the 'grand performance of her career'.The plot of Black Swan is a contrived one pretending to be convoluted, as it takes the overused approach of 'going' surreal and eerie in order to overlook the loopholes in the film. If I compare this with 'Mulholland Drive', a vastly better film, the first noticeable difference in both the films is the position of the characters – Naomi was a failed actress who had plotted to kill her bisexual lover who got the part, while Nina Sayers has already got the main part. Who seems more susceptible to madness – Naomi's Diane or Natalie's Nina? I pick the first, and would most, because failure drives you nuts. Success may send one to the rehab, but that usually involves overuse of drugs or heightened anxiety over a long period. Nina here does something that's generally not done by sane people by the end of the film, and it's just her first performance as the Swan Queen. Also, judging by her personality, who in the right state of mind would have picked her for such a sterling performance? It's almost exploitation of a disturbed woman, and we viewers are witnesses to the act. How did no one notice the abrasive change in her mental condition? Or are we to think that everyone in ballet is cruel and willing to sacrifice someone in the process of creating an act? Nina's mental decadence seemed implausible just because of a night out, high pressure and Dermatillomania; the only effects that I could see was some vomiting, headaches, tantrums and a reparable breakdown. Unfortunately, Darren goes for a 'showy Oscar-moment' ending instead and fools the audience – even I got fooled on my first viewing of The Black Swan. Not in the second, though. The movie progresses well till be have the untimely sex, bloodshed and looniness that just come out of nowhere like the alligator in 'Adaptation'. It then becomes maudlin, overwrought and reckless, like an orchestra being suddenly accompanied by DJs and strippers.Natalie Portman won an Oscar for portraying a timid wreck in the film, and she worked hard for this role. My father must've surely seen her in some previous film, but couldn't recognize her here and indeed, it's hard to because she lost so much weight. I could make out from this performance that she worked well as long as the director used her well. In the hands of a mediocre director or a mediocre film, she may crumble – just watch her cringe-worthy performance in Your Highness. She however, and it's partly because the script itself is riddled with improbabilities and excesses, doesn't realize her Black Swan as well as the White one on screen. Surely she danced well and snogged well, but she made herself look more like a spoiled girl than a disturbed girl. I remember Jessica Lange's applaud-worthy portrayal in 'Frances' – Natalie is not so good an actress to transcend her character's complexities on the screen fully but she does try her at least. Mila Kunis, in a relatively simpler performance maintains her character well, and so does Vincent Cassell. Again I felt the film would've been more effective had Thomas himself been the Prince along with the director. Hershey and Ryder do their duties as mother and ex-Swan Queen respectively, especially Hershey as her scenes with Natalie are standouts.Darren gives a claustrophobic film, not only by limiting the characters to a few, but also by having tight close-ups of Nina throughout. It is hard to believe that Nina only was involved with Thomas and the guy playing prince, since the rehearsals would've had to integrate all the other performers as well at the later stage. Again, this is common aspect among psychological-thrillers to sidetrack the event itself and focus on prime characters. The close shots though are praiseworthy; we are constantly updated on Nina's state of mind. The cinematography and production are bleak and brilliant and robbed of Oscars.I wish the film had ended differently, or started differently or progressed differently instead of serving this.My Rating: 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Take A Bow ""Portman""","Black Swan is a psychological thriller film directed by Darren Aronofsky. The film stars Natalie Portman, Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey, and Winona Ryder.A dancer struggles wins the lead role in a prestigious ballet ""Swan Lake"", however she finds herself slipping into madness when the artistic director, decides that her rival might fit the role better.Wow what a beautifully and artistically crafted masterpiece. The best part of the film is that the film relies on pure acting and almost zero VFX support. A big shout out for Natalie Portman for her outstanding acting and she undoubtedly deserved an Oscar for her role. She displays the emotions, insecurities and challenges of the ballet dancer along-with the obsession of a ballet dancer for the lead role with perfection.Plot of the film is based on a life of a ballerina dancer surrounded by her overprotective mother and stiff competition in the dancing arena. The execution of the film is top notch and will keep you engaged throughout.The acting is probably the strongest aspect of the film has the film was heavily relied on acting and apart from the outstanding performance by Portman other cast were equally impressive and leaves a mark. The dance sequences and the music in the film is superb and supports the screenplay perfectly. The climax and the closure of the film is equally strong and though provoking.If you are looking forward to watch a superbly acted and crafted film then this is the film for you.

Great movie,"I've seen this movie before and didn't realize how much profanity and explicit sex scenes were in it. But all I can say I was here for the ballet and nothing else. One thing that Natalie did a great job in her performing both Odette and Odile and talk about realty getting into character; which is awesome to watch. It will great if we can lose the profanity...like the f word that has been used the most in this film.This is not a children's movie. Even I wasn't too crazy to watch it again.. Like I mentioned before, I was only there to watch the ballet from rehearsed to opening night.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Balanced like a ballerina...,"Darren Aronofsky has made some of the most remarkable nightmares on film. Whether plunging into the mystique of numerology, the destructive wages of drug abuse, or the woes of a wrestler past his prime, Aronofsky makes films of style and intellect that are topped by very few directors, especially in this day and age. Sure enough, ""Black Swan"" is just as worthy of a film as the director's previous efforts.I felt the film started off as a typical, mild character-driven drama; lots of ladies dancing, lots of bitter rivalry and stress, but little on conflict, much less style. But toward the second half, the film became totally whack. A few visual hints are dropped in the first half, which will likely make you blink and ask yourself ""did I really see that?!"" In the second half, it becomes substantially more intense, the visuals become extraordinarily trippy and surreal, and all conflict reaches a proper climax. If you stick with it, the film will be engrossing and sublime, with enough emotional punch and food-for-thought to keep you intrigued and entertained. I'd say it's about as rewarding as ""Fight Club."" The story itself is simple and straightforward; a petty drama involving ballerinas doing a bold new vision of the Swan Lake spiel. As the film goes on, it reaches deeper beneath the surface and pulls up some strong character development and refreshing thematic territory. This is very much a story about perfection, not only in the dancers' performances, but in the sense of duality: the union between light and dark creates a perfect balance that ultimately drives the main character to confront, fight, and ultimately transform herself. Not to mention, there are also some strong themes concerning maturity, lifestyles, sexuality, and ambition. The film also manages to throw in decent helpings of paranoia, and works very effectively to toy around with the audience's sense of understanding what's real in the film and what isn't. In the end, it may not be a terribly grandiose plot, but it does have great depth, and I find the central theme of corruption and duality quite elegant.As far as the cinematography goes, I was pleased with the photography; there are some bouncy documentary-style cameras, but not nearly as many as I expected. Editing is excellent. Acting is great; Natalie Portman is perfect as Nina and Vincent Cassel is good. I usually find it hard to take Mila Kunis seriously, but she actually did a great job here. Writing seems good. Production value is high, and contains some awesome costumes and interesting sets. Clint Mansell's use of classical music fits this movie well, and does have a few standout moments.There are quite a few sex scenes, a few cringe-worthy moments, and a lot of dark surreal imagery, and will likely deter some viewers. But none of it is overly-graphic or gratuitous at all, and I see little reason not to recommend it to anybody.4.5/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4.5/5, film: 4.5/5, emotional impact: 3/5)",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Scary build-up,"There were times during the film where it didn't quite hook me or keep my attention...at first. As it progressed, it became increasingly horrifying and uncomfortable to watch which oddly made it much better. I really liked its style and the director of this movie (Darren A.) has made some impressive movies in the past using remarkably terrifying yet convincing delusional episodes for its characters to go through (like in Requiem for a Dream). Natalie Portman acted very well and I'm really glad that I chose to keep watching it and not turn it off.

Swan Or Ugly Duckling?,"What were they thinking, if thinking at all?. Once you get past all the promo type reviews and the thoughts of the schlock horror fanatics - you begin to find just how disappointed so many of those who rushed off to buy a ticket truly were. Yet another multi award work flickers out across the screen into oblivion. How long will it take the public to realize the academy may consist of many out-of-touch folk with one goal - to promote the industry and ticket purchases by any means.This is the second film I've seen from director Darren Aronofsky, I won't be in any rush to see another. The first, 'NOAH' was equally as appalling as this mess. 'Swan' is based on a perverse script by Andres Heinz (and others) who succeed in revolting the viewer with all manner of uninspiring, low grade ideas. No-one comes out of this cesspool without being drenched in these film makers sordid sludge. Exquisite Natalie Portman is reduced to mere cheap porn - while the writers and director get off on all sorts of unnecessary gratuitous personal sex details (one reviewer aptly called it ""Misery Porn""). Portman is one of those rare talents who truly deserves a class role to introduce her as a dramatic performer - sadly, she does't get that here.This sleazy film is so off the mark in all departments that Huffington Post labeled it: ""Simply Higher Priced Cheese"" (they were being kind) while the Hollywood reporter rightly called it: ""Rabit Hole Preposterousness"". As cliché ridden art fraud Psychobabble it should have rightly been shunned by an industry wanting to preserve any worth it might still possess. Certain elements of the ticket buying public may have been reduced to mulch, but certainly not all - watch the popularity meter plummet...Undiscerning viewers may not understand too many of the above comments but, if you care about what you let mess up your head - then stay away for your health's sake.Note: And to think this director was once quoted as uttering...""Finally we can stop thinking about the culture of superficiality"". Well then Mr Aronofsky, please tell us when this might begin to happen? or at least, what happened on the way!",,Anonymous,Drama
As Flawed As It Is Beautiful,"Darren Aronofsky's latest film is either a masterpiece or an awful mess. Or maybe both. Black Swan tells the story of a ballerina dancer named Nina, played by Natalie Portman, who is cast as the Swan Queen in Swan Lake. She believes her role is threatened by another dancer named Lily, played by Mila Kunis. Nina's perfectionism starts getting the better of her as she slowly loses grip on reality. Her situation is made even more complicated by her overbearing mother who was once a ballerina but gave it up to raise Nina. Aronofsky's take-no-prisoners film-making style is at the forefront of the picture. He leaves very little to the imagination which is what has caused such polarizing view of his film. His shaky camera is always right behind Portman's head and it does get a little annoying after a while but it also builds tension nicely. That being said Aronofsky's no Hitchcock. The way he builds tension is always ruined by his heavy-handed symbolism. In almost every scene there's a mirror of some sort. I suppose this is to help unintelligent people figure out that Nina's losing it or maybe Natalie Portman just likes to look at herself. Also, Aronofsky tries to have the story mirror the plot of the ballet, similar to The Red Shoes. After learning the ballet's plot at the beginning of the film, the entire audience will know how the movie ends. Therefore, the Black Swan's ""twist ending"" is rendered useless. There is a twist ending but unfortunately it's not quite worth what it puts us through. Despite its flaws, the film is technically beautiful. The makeup and costume design perfectly complements the film's dark tone. Portman's performance is nothing special, but I may be biased since I'm not a fan of her work. It may also be that I'm tired of Portman being portrayed as an innocent damsel in distress. No,the best performance in the film is that of Mila Kunis. She has to act both what she is in reality and as the threat she represents to Nina. Surprisingly, she pulls off both rather well. Also in the cast is Winona Ryder playing a former prima-ballerina that has fallen from grace. It's a good film that's definitely worth seeing but don't get your hopes too high.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Black Swan (2010),"Directed by Darren Aronofsky. Starring Natalie Portman, Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey, Winona Ryder, Benjamin Millepied, Ksenia Solo, Kristina Anapau, Toby Hemingway, Sebastian Stan. (R)NYC ballet company impresario Cassel is opening the season with his ""reimage"" of ""Swan Lake"" and needs to cast the dual-faceted Swan Queen; dedicated ballerina Portman is perfect for the technical, precise White Swan, but lacks the bold, seductive qualities needed for the Black Swan. Part cutthroat backstage melodrama, part paranoid psychological horror film, elevated by Portman's obsessive, transformative performance as a cloistered ingenue willing to go as far as needed to achieve artistic perfection. Some of the plot developments and symbolism can be obvious, only finding striking notes of astonishment when it retreats into Portman's psyche and lets her growing madness obfuscate reality. Aronofsky's feverish, gripping vision blurs the docudrama-style grittiness of his ""The Wrestler"" with the bracing, messy nightmares of his ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream""; it's the sort of movie that he seemed destined to make, and only he could deliver quite like this. Strong supporting performances and Matthew Libatique's sensational camera work are worthy of praise as well, though a movie like this is bound to polarize no matter its actorly and technical qualities.84/100",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Black Swan is the most intense, erotic and passionate movie of 2010. Outstanding","BLACK SWAN – CATCH IT ( A+ ) Black Swan is the most intense, erotic and passionate movie of 2010. Most of the time it happens that the psychological thrillers take time to throw the psyche of the movie to the audiences but Darren Aronofsky didn't play safe from the moment we are introduced to Nina (Natalie Portman) the ballet dancer, her psyche or mental state is thrown at us as she passes through the mirrors & feels somebody is following her. From there I knew that I am in for a treat, it's not the typical psychological thrillers we see normally every year. From first scene till the last scene, I was on edge of my seat and towards the ending I literally forgot to blink or even breathe because it was such a complex, intense & mind boggling thriller that I didn't wanted to miss a second of White Swan Battling Black Swan. Though during the Nina's psychological condition gets worse & even for me it was hard to understand what real & what's not? But the acquisition of ""Black Swan"" theater in the end created a spell over me and the moment Natalie Portman performance the Black Swan sequence I was literally stunned to see how gracefully or I should say aggressively she transforms into the Black Swan. I don't have perfect words to describe Natalie Portman's portrayal on Nina, she brought the elegance, the beauty, the intensity, the exoticness & the pressure of Ballet dances into the Life. Her portrayal is so honest that it actually makes you wonder what actually Ballet/Ballerina or even dancers have to go through preparations for reaching to PERFECTION. Natalie Portman completely deserves all the accolades, awards this year, she earned every bit of it & I can't wait to see her taking her Golden Globe & Oscar award. Mila Kunis was a pleasant surprise of the movie, she was right parallel to Natalie Portman because where Natalie brought the intensity, and Mila brought the sweetness to the movie. The chemistry between Natalie Portman & Mila Kunis is exceptional. Mila Kunis also deserves all the accolades & awards nominations. Vincent Cassal was cut throat Brilliant, it was amazing to see hoe he arose exoticness in Nina & then suddenly left her hanging there in Aww of him. Winona Ryder's cameo was nicely presented and she never disappoints. Barbara Hershey as over stepping & sensitive mother of Nina Sayers is incredible. Ksenia Solo as Veronica did a fine job. Benjamin Millepied as David/Prince of ""Swan Lake"" is an exceptional ballet dancer. It was just spell biding to see him gliding with Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis. Sebastian Stan and Toby Hemingway provided the perfect good looks required at the bar sequence. Overall an exceptionally intense, passionate and erotic movie and its worth watching for dazzling performances by Natalie Portman & Mila Kunis.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Goose (bumps),"For 2011, the movie I'm most looking forward to is ""Pirates 4"" (and ""Your Highness""). For 2010 it was ""Inception"" and ""Wall Street 2"". And while Inception did match my expectation, Wall Street wasn't quite as good as I hoped for (though it's not a bad movie either). And while I do know of quite a lot of movies that will come out in 2011, there is a chance, that there will be a movie there, that will catch me by surprise ... like Black Swan did in 2010.I am a fan of Aranofsky and I liked his other movies too. But I would never have guessed that Black Swan would have me caught up like it did. It is not a horror movie in a pure sense, but it does have quite a lot of moments of tension. And there is a sequence towards the end of the movie, that had me at the edge of my seat. Plus the goosebumps I am mentioning in the summary line (and the theater was heated!).While ""true"" horror movies can make you ""jump out of your seat"", by a music cue, this really did have a strong vibe in the entire sequence. Of course boiling it down to just that (great) sequence would do injustice to the rest of the movie. And the great acting at hand. While the story is not new, the sound design, the editing, the framing, the acting and everything that got put into this movie, works excellent in favor of it.If you had asked me in early December, I would have said Inception is my movie of the year 2010. But then I got the chance to watch Black Swan and I am truly amazed by this. Just talking about it, excites me and that has not happened in a long time.

Twisted Insides,"Black Swan, the latest from Darren Aronofsky is a twisty-turny psychodrama in the vein of Roman Polanski with aspects of The Wrestler through in for good measure. The film constantly pumps itself through with menace, leaving the audience increasingly jolted until the sweeping conclusion.The story is hard to explain without spoiling anything. Nina (Natalie Portman, at her restrained best) is an earnest ballerina hoping for her big moment. She is potentially foiled (or is she?) by Lily (Mila Kunis), a more striking figure.. all the while under the auspices of Thomas (Vincent Cassel, channeling plenty of smarminess). Along for the ride is Nina's overriding mother (Barbara Hershey) and an dancer on the skids, Beth (Winona Ryder). As these characters collide the plot becomes less and less coherent.And this does not pose any problems for Aronofsky who along with his capable collaborators in both aural and visual realms works to stir a striking environment. The New York city streets are constantly empty, leaving Nina to face off against unknown forces. Her overdone apartment speaks volumes about her childlike state. Aronofsky, like what he did with Mickey Rourke, hovers behind Portman constantly with his camera creating a sense of constant alertness. Rather than shooting dialogue in two shots, he cuts in front of both actors to convey a volley of emotional drama. Like Polanski's Rosemary's Baby or Repulsion, Aronofsky tries to stir up as much menace as possible. Every frame feels tense, especially when the story becomes more splintered.The visceral impact of this works because it serves as the driving force behind the film. It's practically impossible to isolate a singular aspect of Black Swan; the sound design, the performances, the writing, etc. all coalesce under Aronofsky's commanding vision. Here he has fully matured as a director, confident in his constantly stylistic protrusions. Consequently the film, like Requiem for a Dream, leaves the viewer gasping for air. By the time the ending credits begin there is a definitive response-but to what, exactly? Are Black Swan's pleasures all sensory? Is there something more intellectually engaging underneath the strong exterior?These are questions like to divide viewers. But it is a film that works, thanks to Aronofsky's direction, and one that leaves an impression throughout and immediately after. What happens after remains to be seen.",,Anonymous,Drama
A years worth of movies and finally an serious Oscar contender!,"Darren Aronofsky hits another home run!! Loved Requiem For A Dream, The Wrestler, The Fountain and now this.

Nina will have to take on the duo rolls of the white swan and the evil twin the black swan. She has heavy competition for this role in the form of Lily (Mila Kunis). Incredible amounts of pressure and an influential dark side from lily, may make Nina the star of the show or a real life black swan herself.

"Move Over Queen Amidala, There's a New Swan in Town","Film provocateur Darren Aronofsky takes the theme of artistic obsession and perfection to breathtaking extremes in ""Black Swan,"" his latest movie freak out.Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayers, an accomplished but cold ballerina, whose obsession with control and perfection in her dancing jeopardizes her chances at landing the role of a dancer's lifetime, the Swan Queen in ""Swan Lake."" After she convinces the show's director (Vincent Cassel) that she can be sexual and dangerous, she gets the part of both the white and black swan, usually danced by two different people, and thus begins her nightmarish journey to lose herself enough to convincingly play the black swan. Lose herself she does, but not just artistically. ""Black Swan"" is one long sustained note of mental frenzy as Nina cracks.The formal structure of ""Black Swan"" mirrors Nina's mental state. The film builds up to moments of outrageous camp, but always backs off just before it allows itself to go completely over the top. I spent most of the film wishing that it would push further, until I realized that the movie was building to one of the most memorable climaxes I can recall, when Nina finally makes her full transformation into the black swan. As horrifying as these final scenes are, they're also thrilling, and the film sent me out on a high.Natalie Portman is perfect casting as a high-strung, fragile ballerina, and for most of the movie she's not asked to do much more than cry and whimper. But those last scenes, when she so effectively convinces both audiences -- the one in the film and the one watching it -- that she's got what it takes to be dangerous, put the rest of her performance in perspective and make the whole thing more impressive than it might be at first glance. She's given a lot of terrific support by Cassel, Mila Kunis as a fellow ballerina who may or may not be a rival to Nina, and especially Barbara Hershey, as Nina's stage mom from ballerina hell. Also making a couple of brief appearances as a washed up dancer is Winona Ryder, who finds some new and unsettling uses for a letter opener.""Black Swan"" suggests something I've suspected for quite a while -- that frequently an artist's best work is created when he is least sane.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Quite possibly my most anticipated of the year, Black Swan let me down with it's dark, difficult, and absurd downward spiral. Am I impressed? Yes. Am I enthralled? No.","Black Swan is not the movie most people think it is. Whenever the film is brought up in casual conversation, it's often referred to as the movie about ballet or the new Natalie Portman movie about a ballerina. While ballet provides the backdrop for the film, this is not a film about ballet. This is a film about the infinite pursuit of perfection, the intense desire to succeed, and the extremely dark places our mind can go when something becomes an obsession.Black Swan stars Natalie Portman as Nina Sayers, a ballerina in a New York City ballet company. The company is getting ready to stage a new revival of Swan Lake, a contemporary classic in which a girl is turned into a swan by an evil sorcerers curse. Where in the original, the girl is broken from the spell when she finds a prince who will set her free, in this revival, the prince falls in love with the wrong swan, the black swan, ultimately leading to the death of the white. The twist? In this revival, the dancer selected as the Swan Queen needs to play both the white swan and the black swan, a role that on one hand requires purity and perfection, while the other requires sexuality and a sense of intense passion. Does Nina Sayers have both? That's the central theme to this story as the rest of the film progresses.In his review for Black Swan, Roger Ebert writes, ""Darren Aronofsky's 'Black Swan' is a full-bore melodrama, told with passionate intensity, gloriously and darkly absurd."" With this statement, I couldn't agree more. This film is all out warfare on its central character of Nina Sayers. It is extremely dark, and often at times, as Ebert States, completely absurd. There were moments when I knew what was coming next and still had to look away. There were moments when I wanted to scream at the screen and say ""Why is this happeningplease pull yourself together!"" I don't know whether to praise the film for being so ""out there"" or to criticize it for going too far. It's an intriguing film, but I didn't once enjoy it. It's beautiful but completely uncomfortable, and it couldn't be further from what I think every average, everyday film-goer is expecting.If there's one reason to see this film, other than to simply witness the insanity, it's for the performance of Natalie Portman. In this role, she's less of an actress and more of a true performer. She's featured in every scene of the film, every shot. She trained for 10-months to prepare for her role in this film and it shows as she is not simply a stand in in any of the ballet scenes, she is a literal ballerina. She weighs what appears to be under 90 lbs. exhibits the purest of pure and the darkest of dark. She literally transforms from white to black, sane to insane, shining to stark. It is my most sincere prediction that she will win an Oscar for this performance, and regardless of the film itself, I would consider it well deserved.Black Swan is an evil movie, more disturbing than most films I've seen recently. It's a horror film and a thriller, hidden beautifully under the disguise of a contemporary ballet. Is it worthy of the critical acclaim it's garnering nationwide since it's initial limited release? As an art form, I'd say yes. As a source quality entertainment, I'd say no. Black Swan is the equivalent of watching a straight A student turn into a down and out junkie. Just because the film is award-winning, doesn't mean it's enjoyable. Quite possibly my most anticipated of the year, Black Swan let me down with it's dark, difficult, and absurd downward spiral.

Beautiful and Scary at the Same Time,"I am not really a fan of ballet. Ordinarily I would not really catch a film with this setting. However in this case, the Oscar buzz surrounding ""Black Swan"" made me want to watch it. So I watched, and I was enthralled by its artistry and repelled by its subject matter at the same time.""Black Swan"" tells of Nina, a promising young ballet dancer, who led a very sheltered life shuttling on trains between her ballet and her home with a domineering mother. When she wins the lead role of Swan Queen in an upcoming production of ""Swan Lake,"" she begins to mentally unravel in the most disturbing emotional, psychological, and physical (?) breakdown captured on screen. Can she successfully pull off the dance she had dreamed off all her life, or will her demons turn her dreams into a nightmare?We see Natalie Portman like we have never seen her before. She is both very fragile and very daring in her tour de force performance as the rigid and repressed girl obsessed with perfection. Her ballet sequences were very realistic. She was truly a prima ballerina in this production. Not even a hot lesbian love scene could deter her. Her Oscar for Best Actress is clearly within her grasp. Mila Kunis plays Lily, a rival dancer with a contrasting carefree and natural dance style, with so much vitality in contrast with Portman's frigidity. Barbara Hershey plays Nina's mother, whom we could not immediately see as good or bad for her.It is impossible to describe in words this very visual film experience. I would not want to spoil things for you. You will not know which things are real and not. This is NOT just a ballet movie. Amidst the beauty, there is a persistently disturbing and downright scary tone as the movie reaches its climax. You will be hypnotized, but several times you would also want to stop watching the film. The disturbing images will stay with you. Like ballet, this film is also not for everyone, but for me, director Darren Aronofsky has created himself a classic psychological thriller.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
I just want art movie,"While the movie could have been very good, they added an atmosphere of unnecessary fear and tension, I understand why they did it, but I didn't like it at all, it didn't draw me in.

"Aronofsky hits it out of the park with ""Black Swan""","Just saw ""Black Swan"" at a packed house in NYC. Ostensibly the story of a ballerina played by Natalie Portman preparing to dance the lead role in ""Swan Lake"", it was really about refusing to submit in the face of incredible demands and everyday paranoia morphing into legitimate terror.The movie was threaded with fear-inducing images and palpable scenes of murder and graphic sexuality that may have happened only in the lead actor's mind. Aronofsky put us right there in the fevered brain of the perfect little ballerina grappling with yearning, jealousy and desire.Intense and horrifying with incredibly hot adult sexuality. The acting was superb, with Vincent Cassel as the ballet director, Barbara Hershey as the mother from hell and Mila Kunis as Portman's rival, as bawdy as Portman is virginal.But Natalie Portman as the Swan Queen was astonishing. She was in almost every scene growing from a momma's girl to a ferocious dancer. She became the Black Swan out of sheer will. Gotta see it to know what the Black Swan is. I'll give you a hint: it's the meaning of life. Ending gives a nod to ""The Red Shoes"" but Aronofsky's thriller is in a class by itself.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A new take on Tchaikowsky's classic.,"The themes of Tchaikowsky's Swan lake, goodness and innocence versus evil and seduction, may ring cliché to some. However, Aronofsky's latest offers a fresh and highly disturbing take on the classic. Nina (played by the always immaculate Portman) is the rising star of the New York Ballet, and despite being a perfect fit to play the White Swan she also faces the challenge of portraying its dark and evil twin. Adding to the pressure is the company's newcomer, Lily (Kunis), who represents all the qualities Nina lacks - mystery, sensuality and danger. As the opening night draws closer, our prima ballerina starts to break down, sinking deeper and deeper into the twisted persona of the Black Swan. As with most Aronofsky films, the interpretation of the story lies in the mind of the beholder. Perhaps it is the age old tale of being devoured by the dark side of human nature, or maybe it is a metaphor for the incredible pressure professionals in the performing arts are faced with. Whatever the case, Black Swan grabs you tightly from the opening scene and doesn't let go until the end credits start to roll.Unsurprisingly, Portman, Cassel and the other name actors all deliver. The big shocker of the lot is Mila Kunis, mostly known for her role as Jackie in The 70's Show. With a very rough and edgy acting style, she is the perfect fit for Lily, the counter force to Porman's character that carries a lot of the film. Still being a very inexperienced actress, Aronofosky doesn't force Kunis out of her comfort zone, but it will be interesting to see if she fulfills her potential as a quality actress in years to come. Speaking of which, the nowadays very underused Winona Ryder proves she's still got it as the self-destructive former soloist of the company. The scenes in which she reveals her desperation after being abandoned by the only thing she ever knew, ballet, are some of the most intense throughout the film.It is a testament to Aronofsky's talent that after successfully portraying the soft and sensitive side of the wrestling world, he now unveils the brutality of professional ballet. It is an unforgiving world with no room for error, devouring its servants as they struggle to reach perfection. This reality appears even more absurd when juxtaposed against the softness and beauty of the dance itself, another strong point of Aronofsky's directing. He creates scenes which such incredible beauty it completely mesmerizes the viewer and reminds us of why Swan Lake is one of the greatest works of art ever created. Maybe he wants to highlight that all that suffering and sacrifice is worth it, even necessary, to achieve the final product. This ideology can be parallelled with the film itself, too. With incredible attention to detail, meticulous camera work and actresses thin to the point of starvation, Black Swan is definitely not a movie made overnight. Aronofsky's finest work to date gets a well deserved 5/5.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Many good points,"This movie can express unique world in dancers well.Nina dances as real ballerina.We can find Natalie's great effort in it.Her life in detail was also as a ballerina.All dancers desire to be principal.The desire is always insane. The Insanity sometimes bring people death.Many ballet story deals with same death.It is a very interesting theme. Her mother expect Nina to be principal and she found Nina her doll.Nina needed outgrow mom's dependence.It was one of the highlight of this story.Nina grows her personality through her training SWAN LAKE, she became to be able to play BLACK SWAN.The last dance was very powerful and impressive.",,Anonymous,Drama
"Perfection, instead of Greatness","""Black Swan"" is macabre indulgent crap. Although exquisitely crafted, it's ultimately a waste of 2 hours. Director Darren Aronofsky's touch is so heavy handed and blunt in his tale of spiraling meltdown. Natalie Portman is powerful as Nina, and will win an Oscar. ""Black Swan"" is classic tragedy, but lacks eloquence and resonance. Paradoxically, Aronofsky's sledgehammer like narrative overwhelms the elusive grace and refinement of ballet. I admired Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler"", also a tale of deceptive physicality and discipline. However, something is amok here. Even as literal metaphor of ""Swan Lake"", ""Black Swan"" morphs as a very unpleasant experience. Portman's Nina hauntingly says, ""I just want to be perfect."" This echoes throughout as tortured obsession. Aside from the magnificent prowess of dance, the screenplay by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John McLaughlin is unrelenting waves of corporeal rage and suffering.The hand held camera shots in ""Black Swan"" give it a gritty and austere feel. Natalie Portman trained nearly 2 years to prepare for the role of Nina Sayers. Her protruding ribs in her breast are scary authenticity. Her gaunt persona captures the rigid and wounded spirited Nina, who is an impeccable technician, but fearful of risking the freedom of her art. As the story unfolds, perhaps her instincts were warranted. Portman is riveting and nuanced. She enrolls us into Nina's life despite Aronofsky's opaque narrative strokes. Nina suffers blistering nerve rashes and mangled toes. Nina is the dedicated ballerina, who is finally called to audition for the role of the Swan Queen in ""Swan Lake"".Director Thomas (darkly charming Vincent Cassel) knows that Nina can embody the White Swan, but questions whether she can summon the dark fire of the Black Swan. Thomas replaces his aging lover-- prima ballerina Beth (used and tragic Winona Ryder), in his envisioning of ""Swan Lake"". Nina is aware that she may be auditioning for more than just the lead. Her obsessive stage Mom Erica (dramatically taut Barbara Hershey), also fears the inevitable. Erica is eerily controlling, and as a former dancer proxies her life for her daughter Nina. Here Aronofsky brilliantly exposes Nina as one who forsakes greatness for perfection. However, I think he forfeits this thread in the catharsis. Enter Mila Kunis's Lily, the Black Swan of the tale. Lily is the talented untamed dancer, willing to risk all in life and in dance. Lily lacks the precision of Nina, but possesses unbridled passion and sensuality.Lily and Nina are logical rivals, and lyrical Yin and Yang of the same person. If you are a fan of YouTube, you are aware of their erotic Sapphic tryst. It is captivating; however, like much of ""Black Swan"" this occurs as manipulation on the part of the director. The concluding arc of ""Black Swan"" lost me. Half way through, we get that Nina is battling for her own sanity. To that end, Portman is amazing and displays poignant suffering and muted joy. The performances are grand. Cassel is creepy duplicity. Kunis is awesome as the maverick dancer living on the edge.I think ""Black Swan"" fails despite great effort in exposing the perfection myth. Yes, perfection is manifested in youth, beauty, and talent. There is perfection in icons like James Dean and Bruce Lee. The tragedy of these icons was that the possibility of greatness was forsaken too soon. ""Black Swan"" celebrates the pursuit of perfection, not the legacy of greatness—of altering and inspiring the world. Perfection is misguided and fleeting pursuit. Greatness is the game worth playing and living. ""Black Swan"" seems to miss this distinction, and that is a little sad.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Portman is a beautiful swan...,"Darren Aronofsky, the director of the Oscar snubbed films ""The Wrestler"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"" has created his most emotionally and visually charged film yet, ""Black Swan."" Showcasing a career best performance from Natalie Portman, this dark, demented, and at times brilliant take on the world of ballet assures any doubt of Aronofsky's depth. He goes back to his roots while revamping and maturing his own style. A complex yet simple concept from screenwriters Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John J. McLaughlin marries with the director artistic capabilities like a great love story. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique nearly narrates this tale with such ferocity, it leaves the viewer breathless. Clint Mansell who has been ignored for far too long orchestrates once again, a magnificent score that hopefully will not be ignored. Supporting players Mila Kunis and Barbara Hershey respect their roles and deliver them poignantly throughout. But once again, enough cannot be said about Academy Award Nominee Natalie Portman. This is the role I will remember Natalie Portman for forever. She balances a broken, wounded character and breathes a hungry, cannibalistic woman tearing through the screen, frame after frame after frame. Definitely one of, if not, the best performance by any actor this year. ""Black Swan"" should be proud to be standing on its own merit with no obvious plot or clear ideas, just pure imagination and curiosity keeps us involved.

Best movie of 2010!,"""The only person standing in your way is you."" The best movie of the year in my opinion. Plot: A Ballet dancer drifts deeper into insanity as her big day as The Swan Queen in Swan Lake apporoaches. Director Darren Aronofsky(Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain, The Wrestler) gives a dark but unique atmoshere to this psychological thriller. Almost everything about this movie is perfect aside from one or two laughably bad moments. The movie has some pretty freaky moments and a few that may make you cringe but that just adds to the intensity But the best part about this movie is Natalie Portman. This is her best performance in my opinion. I'll be very surprised if she doesn't get nominated for an Oscar and I'll be angry if she doesn't win that Golden Globe she's been nominated for. She at least deserves that. She made her character so realistic. Mila Kunis is good to but she's nowhere near as good as Portman. Film makers, take note on this.

Nothing remotely impressive about this movie. It's not an awful film, but there's absolutely nothing praiseworthy, either. It's what I call ""background entertainment"" (the kind of movie that plays unnoticed in the background while you're doing something else).Some scenes were downright disgusting. Not sure what the point of all the sadism in the movie is; it adds nothing to it. I'm not seeing any of this ""sophistication"" people speak of. It reeks of banality and is full of clichés. Quite predictable, too.The idea behind it is fascinating, but the delivery ruins it all. The movie is BORING!

Natalie Portman is generally a half-decent actress, but she wasn't very convincing this time.I'm giving it 1 star only to counter the ridiculously high rating it currently has, which it really doesn't deserve.

I Give it a 9/10,"Black Swan is definitely a film that will send shivers up you spine, but it also has a beauty of its own, affiliating with the subject of ballet. Darren Aronofsky has a unique set of art direction in this film and a sense of elegant beauty within each scene, mainly the ballet. Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman)seems to become disturbed, especially after newcomer and rival, Lily or the ""Black Swan"" comes along, trying to get the title role in stage director Thomas Leroy's (Vincent Cassel) ballet performance. The film has some stunning sequences and may disturb many people, but I actually enjoyed all of it. Everything seemed to fit and as the story goes on, the deeper we are drawn into Portman's disturbing hallucinations. Or are they hallucinations. See for yourself because Black Swan is an instant winner and got my vote. 9/10 Rated R - 108min",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Nathalie,"The movie is good and kept me in a tensed mode from beginning to end. While the music more than underscores the strong emotions felt by Nina, the Black Swan revolves solely on Nina and Nathalie Portman. Her performance is unique, remarkable, just mind blowing. Rarely have I seen an actor or actress so immensely inside of his/her character. This is an Oscar award, hands up. Back to the movie: take Nathalie Portman out and replace her with a good actress and you have a flop. My vote is a 10 for Nathalie and if the movie receives any other award, it will result from the deep emotion which Nathalie attaches to the movie.

A disturbing masterpiece,"It is quite difficult to write a review for this type of film. If I say anything about the story, one will not enjoy it as much as one actually should. Nevertheless, I will give it a try. First of all, the casting. A brilliant job with no flaws. At the beginning I was wondering if Portman was right for the role, but as the movie progressed the wondering vanished. Her role was difficult and complex both physically and especially mentally; only a master-actress could have done such a marvelous job (an Oscar well deserved). Vincent Cassel was also brilliant. His role was at times so realistic that I kept wondering if he was acting. This man is clearly a perfectionist in real life as is on the screen. Mila Kunis was that one character that gave this movie its final layer of life. Mysterious and dark but also intriguing to say the least. The story is something that develops quite slowly. Slow paced at the beginning but nerve breaking at the end. Only at the ending had I realized that the movie's ending intensity was as intense as it was, exactly because of the slow paced beginning. Some scenes were extremely disturbing but crucial to the development of the story. The ending revelation leaves one sitting and wondering what one had just seen. Shock, sorrow, pain... is something a person feels at the beginning of the end credits. The music was decent. Nothing too specific or ""to-die-for."" This movie was so powerful that I simply cannot find anything negative to say about it. Trying to find the bad elements in such a masterpiece means one just cannot enjoy a work of art when he sees one. Darren Aronofsky has done it again: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Will twist you till you die,"When I sat to watch 'Black Swan' I knew it had already won many awards including best picture, Director and Actress in the leading role in many renowned award ceremonies. But I had only one intention. That was to just enjoy the movie keeping all the fame it has around it aside, and embed myself in to it as someone who watch 'Black Swan' without knowing anything about it. True I have already read many interviews, reviews which covered the topic but none has inspired me to admit it to be a pure seldom work of art and I was not to fall for its grace prematurely.But here I'm after watching 'Black Swan' helpless, stunned and mind frozen, not knowing where to start or how to explain the experience it delivered with full heart and soul just like non I have ever seeing. 'Black Swan' will trick your brain until it fry some nerves and thrill you till you pant and gasp grabbing your seat not knowing what will hit you next. It can scare you more than a horror movie and shatter you and leave you with despair more than a sad love story. You will not be able to tell this is what exactly you felt in those gruesome yet very touching 108 minutes of your life in front of the screen. 'Black Swan' is a peak of psychological thrillers and will eat the other so called movies for breakfast uncooked. Its strong and will make you so weak without your slightest knowledge.Nina is a ballerina (Played by Natalie Portman- Star Wars, V for Vendetta) in a ballet company who has put all her mind and soul in to bringing perfection in to her performance. She completely engulf herself in desire to be one of the best dancers and gets the gem of an opportunity to perform as the Swan in the new version of Swan Lake ballet drama. Overjoyed and thrilled she instantly find new challenges which is physical and mental while preparing for this arduous role. While her art director Thomas (Vincent Cassel-Eastern Promises, Oceans Twelve) continuously puts more and more pressure on her rehearsals and in the same time awkwardly showing interest towards her makes her gets confused and troubled in mind. In the meantime a new dancer Lily (Milla Kunis- Book of Eli) who surprisingly convince Thomas as well starts to appear to be Nina's challenge in the role. Nina starts to feel like her role is insecure and build up her own fight within to grip. Struggling to juggle her person life and dance life Nina becomes a lost soul.Nina's character cannot be explained that easily with few lines. It's complicated and fragile yet very emotional and strong. Natalie Portman plays this role so well that you will never be able to get her emotional filled face out of your brain. Starting from the very difficult ballet performances up to the very strong and heavy emotional scenes, Portman is exceptional. You don't need to second guess to understand her potential to grab all the best actress awards. Not only her but all the main cast in the show is very well played. If I say those are amazing performances I'm not boasting but expressing the whole truth only.'Black Swan' at times is a ride filled with wonderful music, breath taking dance routines which flows like a calm river under the morning sun. And in the next minute it is so shocking and unbelievably loud and might stop your heart for a second.

Yin-Yang,"With ""Black Swan"" Aronofsky presents the other side to his ""Wrestler"".While ""Wrestler"" is a male, linear, lucid story of a guy struggling to get away from his everyday hell, ""Black Swan"" is a female principle, dreamy, artistic, about a girl trying to set her dark side free.For me, the biggest asset of both movies are amazing performances of relevant leading actors, Rourke and Portman. Just amazing casting.As for the content, like every Aronofsky, this one is worth seeing.

Black Swan flies,"Like many great films, ""Black Swan"" uses something basic--something simple enough for the audience to grasp, to explore its characters in an interesting way. It uses this basic concept or idea as a backdrop, not focusing on it, and instead giving us a deep look at its characters. In Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"", this basic idea is the ballet, and more specifically, Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake.Chosen to play the lead role in the play is Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), a woman far more obsessed with her career than anything else in life. She has to fight just to get the role, as the director of the ballet (Vincent Cassel) feels that she doesn't perform well as the Black Swan. This role requires freedom of body, something Nina doesn't have. She fits the role of the White Swan perfectly, having near-perfect technique. She practices whenever she has free time, always pushing herself harder and harder.She has taken over the role from Beth (Winona Ryder), who is retiring shortly. There is also a new dancer arriving. Her name is Lily (Mila Kunis). Nina soon becomes paranoid that Lily is there only to steal her part in the ballet. Lily seems friendly enough, but Nina doesn't trust her. At least, she doesn't right away.Nina has issues herself; paranoia is seemingly the last of her worries. She wakes up one morning with a rash, one that gets worse as the film progresses. She also suffer from hallucinations, or maybe they aren't actually hallucinations. We can't be sure, and neither can she.Unfortunately, the psychological issues that Nina faces and has to overcome are actually the worst parts of ""Black Swan"". The relationships between Nina and her mother Barbara Hershey, Lily and the ballet director are actually far more fascinating than any problems Nina has. Sure, the things going wrong in her head and with her body end up making these relationships more exciting, but when the film focuses solely on these obstacles, it gets less engaging.As I said, the relationships are the most entertaining parts of ""Black Swan"", and this is likely due to the mystery surrounding the supporting cast. Nina is a character we get to know quite well, and we can sympathize with her. This is good, but when you combine this with the fact that you don't know the other characters much, if at all, the contrast between them makes their relationships the most entertaining part of the film.Nina's mother is overbearing and overprotective. She treats Nina like she is 12 years old. (Nina actually mentions this at one point in the film). Nina's mother used to be a dancer, but for reasons we never find out, she gave up on that dream. She is now devoted to Nina's career, viewing it as she wanted to view her own. This brings into question if Nina was forced into ballet, of if it was her own choice. Is Nina as dedicated as she is to please herself, or to please her mother?Lily is kept the most mysterious, and she works in direct contrast to Nina. If this was Swan Lake, Nina would be the White Swan, and Lily would be the Black Swan. Nina's pure, Lily isn't. Lily loosens up easily, Nina's uptight. Surprisingly, opposites don't really attract in this relationship, and the two, despite Lily's best effort, don't gel well.If there is one thing that can be said about ""Black Swan"", it's that the acting is great. Natalie Portman does an amazing job in her self- determined role. Reportedly training for more than six months, both Portman and Kunis are great. They both seem to be good dancers, and we already know that both can act. Their roles are demanding, and you can tell the dedication that both actresses had to their roles.Also requiring mention is the musical score composed by Clint Mansell. Mansell altered Tchaikovsky's original music into something more twisted and fitting to the nature of the film. The soundtrack brings more depth to the feature, and enhances the emotions that are felt within it. It isn't distracting, but it is noticeable. This ends up working fine though, as the soundtrack itself stirs emotions, and ends up setting the tone of the film.""Black Swan"" functions well as a companion to Aronofsky's 2008 film ""The Wrestler"". Both films are about one person so dedicated to their art that they are willing to sacrifice everything else in their life. The leads in both films wish to become perfect in their field. The cost of this is an imperfect rest of their life. Both films are similar in theme, with the only real difference being the fantasy aspect of ""Black Swan"".""Black Swan"" is a film that deserves a viewing. The contrast between Nina, a character who is pure at heart, and the rest of the cast is striking, and the relationship between each of the characters is intriguing and entertaining. The issues Nina has to cope with are actually one of the least interesting parts of the film, yet still serve an important purpose. The performances are amazing, the soundtrack is nice to listen to and the film is emotionally engaging. All in all, it's a stunning film that will amaze and affect you both during, and after you watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Blakean Treatment,"Dazzling! Very beautifully interwoven. Unlike many other films about the two contrary forces within human beings -borrowed from William Blake's symbolism perhaps- this was not about killing the evil inside and becoming innocent or pure, but it is about initiation into experience and letting the evil force show itself.The sexual approaches of Thomas are not sexual abuses but only stimulations to arouse as what we call it her ""evil side"". The mother is the superego (or in Blake's symbolism the URizen) who has imprisoned her daughter inside the walls of innocence. She must initiate into experience so that she can perform the role of the Black Swan better. That is why Thomas is trying to do. For him, the bettering of the ballet is important, he wants a wild, energetic and evil Nina to act out the Black Swan not the meek, innocent Nina who performs the White Swan brilliantly, naturally.I feel dismayed why ""Black Swan"" wasn't awarded the Academy Award for best original score. Why ""The Social Network""? In my opinion, it was unfair. The music of ""Social Network"" was not worth winning the award. ""Swan Lake"" or at least ""Inception"" should have won.

"Over blown, Over wrought and Over acted, but visually very good","I watched Black Swan finally and though it is admittedly very arresting visually, I found the whole thing to be rather tiresome. The problem was with the script. In the first place it was very difficult to give a toss about the central character. I mean really, who cares whether she can excel at her Ballet job? what happens to her if she doesn't? nothing that's what? she'll go back to having a good ballet job playing other characters. A job that many little girls will already envy. The fact that 'artists' think we give a Frick about whether they can dig deep and emerse them selves in a role shows us just how pretentious they are, and this film if anything does reflect how actors and theatre performers take themselves waaaay too seriously. Its not like they're as important as a nurse or a soldier. There is nothing at stake if they fail to perform. But even so, I could maybe have been manipulated to care a bit more if the central character was just a bit more interesting. Jeez this girl was dull. I would walk the other way if i saw her coming down the street. she was impossible to care about. I understand that her character was meant to be closed off but that doesn't help us access the story. We need to root for her and we just don't.Visually tho, it was outstanding, with some very striking moments. Aronofsky is clearly a hugely talented film maker, if a perhaps a little indulgent and too concerned with being 'seen' as a genius at the expense of his audiences experience in his movie.Natalie Portman isn't that great apart from the effort she puts into the ballet scenes, but that's not what acting is all about. that is a peripheral requirement to what's important. She is dull and closed off. and Portman is just over rated as an actress. She was great in Leon but she's been been very ordinary at best in everything else.

The Dark Side of Ballet.,"Mila Kunis once said in an interview that ballet, for her, was just dressing up in a tutu and being pretty. Darren Aronofsky shows us, through his film, ""Black Swan"" how dressing up in a tutu and being pretty are far from what being a dancer is all about. He even dares to show us what a lot of ballet dancers and films fail to show us, the dark side of ballet.Aronofsky's ""Black Swan,"" is a demented drama about what happens when we crave for perfection. This is shown in young Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), a young innocent girl who gets the lead part in a New York City ballet company's newest production of ""Swan Lake."" Her director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassal), casts her after seeing Nina has a dark side, a dark side she denies having. But through the help of a new found friend, Lily (Mila Kunis), Nina discovers her dark side, but in a way she'd never imagine. Through her obsession and self- discovery, Nina will find there's a very heavy fee in pursuing perfection.""Black Swan,"" discusses many topics. Self-discovery, self-doubt, good and evil and cravings for perfection. Things other films and books have discussed before, but not in such a way as Aronofsky's. Through a disturbing and macabre camera lens, we, the audience, are given a beautifully crafted story with top notch actors and brilliant artistic directing.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Like a symphony... the fine tuning and impeccable interplay of every instrument is what makes it transcendent,"With an overbearing mother who lives vicariously through her, the perfectionist Nina lives and dies for getting the lead in the ballet Swan Lake(don't worry, the plot of that is explained early in this, and no, you don't need to like that form of expression... I didn't and don't, and still loved this), as the dual personalities of the Queen. She knows the steps beyond reproach, and she embodies the purity of the White half, as it reflects her own personality. But what of the uninhibited Dark one? Lily is the obvious choice, here, and is thus a potential rival for the part. And as this progresses, our lead comes closer to giving in... but with what result? The ideal casting of all three roles is a vital aspect. The talented Portman throws herself into the innocence(at times, her voice sounds frail as glass) that gradually accepts her urges(the giving up of control that is key to sexuality is an important metaphor in this... and it is rather erotic, and like everything else in this, not gratuitously so), Kunis surprises with how compelling she is, and the stiff-upper lip of Hershey is spot-on. Cassell(another passionate player) is astounding as the direct dance instructor(you truly get a sense of how unrelenting, fast-paced of a world that is). And all four are thoroughly developed, credible characters, in spite of how difficult it is to keep the first three from deteriorating into cliché-ridden, superficial stereotypes. The acting is fantastic for all involved. This really gets to you; I nearly cried three times, of either sadness or joy, feeling what our heroine felt. It's beautifully shot(there's a scene at a club where you are lost in the mood... and while you really are all the time in this, it's one of the strongest examples) and sharply edited all the way through. Like Pi and Requiem for a Dream(this has Clint Mansell also from that doing the score, a twisted variation on Tchaikovsky), this is about obsession and it is about the psychology and what it does to you, and like in those, we are experiencing the the grotesque sights and sounds of the hallucinations along with them. Aronofsky nails you to the seat and in spite of considerably brutal and disturbing portions, you're grateful for it. I recommend this warmly to any fan of his style, or the concept. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Something reminiscent to The Emperor's New Clothes,"Natalie Portman performs skilfully and with dedication her part as the lead. The illogical script and gimmicky directing what comes to the centering untrue psychiatric downfall does not do any favors against demotivating and estranging well-versed viewer and as such only serves as an fantasy of the writer and director, diminishing the room to empathize. Aspires for artistic finesse evident with the style, but lacking the creativity, subtlety and thought provoking sensitivity ends up being a touch artsy. This all adds up for the film to fall far short from greatness. Acting and overall crafty cinematographic style helps to rise this above average filmmaking.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
You Were Perfect,"The preternaturally graceful weaving of themes, acting talent, and striking camera-work made Black Swan one of the most beautiful and preeminent films I've ever seen, and perhaps the best film of 2010.Darren Aronofsky, a revolutionary of directing and film-crafting, effortlessly combined all of the ideas and thoughts seamlessly, and with such cinematic flair that it is almost impossible to ignore this marvel of cinema. His camera is our Black Swan, taking us through lives with Aronofsky's jolty ease, and screen-enveloping passion. Moments of the movie burst with life, and emotion, while others are so subdued it is physically painful to watch without fidgeting.Credit must be given where credit is due, and credit is due to Natalie Portman, the phenomenal back-bone of the film. She captured both the physical and emotional facets of her complex character, and this unfathomable feet is the sole reason she was handed an Oscar.Mila Kunis, in her first break-out role, stupefied me with her refined control of character. Her deliciously and irresistibly seductive, almost siren-like, feats in the film are what supporting actresses only dream they can do. She was the epitome of the idea of Black Swan.Vincent Cassel, an actor who can perfect any ideal or number of passions, managed the task of main catalysts without a. overacting or b. getting any critical acclaim. I believe that he lost out on the critical appeal because he managed to subdue his character in favor of the female leads. He relinquished the spotlight, and a humility of that nature radiates through the film.Winona Ryder, not seen often enough as of late, managed to crown the film with a short exhibition of her many talents, and remind us why we all subscribed to her so easily in past years (and will in future ones).To write about Black Swan without mentioning Clint Mansell's harrowing, and enthralling score would not be tolerated, so I must mention the score that drew me into the moment, and set the mood so perfectly. To be sitting in a chair, in a theater, and to not realize where you are because you are so engulfed in a movie is the product of direction, acting, and of course SCORE. To take the classic score and revamp it beyond all reasonable similarity (yet still leave it primarily the same notes) is a talent only Mansell can claim to have mastered.""Black Swan"" was simply immaculate.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Perfect!!,"Black Swan is a cinematic triumph, bringing a modern day twist to the well-loved Grimm's Fairy tale style of story telling. Darren Aronofsky, director (Requiem for A Dream, The Wrestler) will have you holding your breath as he takes you into the fascinatingly beautiful and complicated world of prima ballerina, Nina (Natalie Portman). Natalie Portman holds nothing back as she slowly reels you into her startling, repressed, emotionally charged inner world. Aronofsky has skillfully interwoven the very sensual world of the ballet with the passion of the individuals who inhabit it.Beautifully designed, photographed and acted the movie is stylish and full of powerful images and intense emotions, my main criticism is that a movie like this needs to be centred around the lead character's relationship with the people around her, but her relationship was mainly to the character in the ballet. What was her fear about? Why was she so afraid of exposing her inner self? What demons lived there? You never find out.""Black Swan"" leaves audiences with all sorts of questions and debatable points, which can be cumbersome, but it really makes for a fascinating discussion. You'll probably be internally at war over questionable little bits and pieces of the film, but it's those little moments that really make the film what it is. The performances here by all the actors are mesmerizing, as is the art direction and the general storytelling itself— this is truly a fascinating, off-kilter piece of cinema, and a true 'black swan' among recent films. It may leave you scratching your head in regards to some of the material that is hinted at and thrown toward us without full explication; but ultimately it won't matter, because ""it was perfect"". 10/10.",,Anonymous,Drama
Dark Descent into Madness,"""I just want to be perfect."" This line illustrates the themes and hardships the main character faces in Black Swan. Fortunately, it also mostly tells of the quality of the film. Natalie Portman plays Nina, a gifted dancer who desires the role of the Swan Queen in a different version of the ballet Swan Lake. Right when she seems to have the role in the bag, along comes Lily, an effervescent dancer new to the company, portrayed by Mila Kunis. She reveals to be subtle, controlled, and free while she dances. These qualities are needed in order to play both the White Swan and the Black Swan in the dance. Shortly after, Nina is overcome with the desire to be perfect, and starts to hallucinate. She sees a double image of herself, drawings which become animated, and other shocking imagery as well. Black Swan is easily one of the best films of 2010. It functions well as a horror film, a psychological thriller, and a showcase of brilliant dancing. The chemistry between Portman and Kunis is seductive and shocking. Their performances convincingly reveal the power and eeriness of ""the dark side."" Both deserve to be in Oscar contention for their work, as does a scene-stealing Barbara Hershey as Nina's controlling mother. Black Swan will make you question whether the events and characters in this film are imaginary or not, and will leave you wondering for hours. This is a horror film for people who don't like horror films.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
7/10,"OK, i gotta say few things about this movie, which is assumed to be some kind of big psychological thriller. i love that kind of movies (memento, the machinist, shutter island, mystic river, the prestige...) , but black swan is way too over rated, and actually became ""famous"" mostly because of good cast and lesbian scene between lovely Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman- that scene is definitely one of the most important things why is this movie so ""big"" and controversial.in my opinion, that is totally lame. i am not saying that film is not worth watching, but it is definitely over rated and not that good as people are talking about it... this is one of these movies that have big promotion, big stars, so people are expecting (too) much, and in the end many of them are disappointed (as me)... 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Mindtrip of a movie,"I had seen the commercial a few times on television and figured I would go ahead and watch it with the girlfriend as it was a nice and quiet Christmas evening at home. I thought this was going to be a chick flick more than anything and I was completely blown away. Natalie Portman's character was played tremendously and Mila Kunis has always been good at playing dark characters. The mother's part was a little on the obsessive compulsive side and the story could have been told without her but it didn't change the impact that the acting had on the movie as well as the storyline itself. The trailer does not justify the movie at all but at the same time if they showed any good scenes from the movie it would spoil the experience itself. Great directing as well as a good cast to support. Great job all around. I am sure that we will watch this one again. P.S.

... and the Oscar goes to (not Natallie Portman),"I viewed Black Swan with women only, all of whom did not like it. They found it offensive, disturbing and not as good as they had hoped. Many critics on IMDb have already found the flaws in the film so I shall not repeat. Portman is a little one dimensional. She is so uptight as the actress never mind her character. I found Nina Sayers irritating and could not sympathize with her. Winona Ryder should have had more screen time as the role of Beth was perfect for her. There is so much which is implausible about the film that the good bits such as art direction, music and atmosphere are somewhat lost. I really wanted to like this film as from the trailers I inferred that it would be top notch - not so. Rather disappointing as I felt something was truly missing and it never jumped out at me. The bad script did not help, it was more than bad it was appalling. Was it horror? Was it thriller? Was it just the story of a repressed girl who was totally unsuitable to be a ballerina? Come the Oscars, I think Jennifer Lawrence from Winter's Bone would be a worthier winner. Portman is a fine actress but was unable to quite deliver in the role; simply put she was too uptight. Judging by so many other negative reviews the film has not lived up to its hyperbole.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
White Swan and Black Swan. Good and evil. The second will dominate over the former for the sake of art ...,"Girl Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), full of promise, a ballerina of the New York ballet. Her life was entirely focused on dancing, and achieving success in their careers. Is largely due to her upbringing. Mama Nina's Eric (Barbara Hershey), a former ballerina, not having achieved recognition, despite all his care, has a negative impact on the girl smothering control and imposing their own ambitions.Plot of the story begins with the moment when the artistic director of Ballet of Nina Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) replaces the prima ballerina Beth McIntyre (Winona Ryder) to open the new season production of ""Swan Lake"".In selecting the lead role, he seeks not a ballerina and actress who will be able to bring on stage two images: white swan and black swan.

""Fuel to the fire,"" she adds Lily (Mila Kunis), in which Nina sees the embodiment of that very black swan. Thoughts and close dialogue seems expensive to achieve the goal - to grasp the essence of assigned roles in the forthcoming statement, but is it true? The plot of the fifth feature film by Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" is built on the theme of the possible existence of two sides of personality and rivalry between a man first and foremost with themselves.The only person standing in your way is you. ©Judging by the scene, the plot films can certainly blame the film for some of the secondary with respect to the known past films (""All About Eve,"" ""Fight Club"", ""Lodger"", ""Inland Empire"") that it would be wrong. ""Black Swan"" is a film, a variation on the same topic, but he has an original in its development and serve the audience on the screen. In a picture Aronofsky the dual personality is good suppression before harm, a white swan before the black swan, restricting self-checking before a freedom. Freedom to which so heroine Natali Portman for the sake of convincing game on a scene of theater of ballet aspires, appears for it secret defects destructive and at the same time captivating by realization, desires and own possibilities. Freedom to which the heroine is so eager to Natalie Portman for the sake of convincing the game at the Theatre Ballet, turns to her destructive and at the same time captivating the implementation of secret vices, desires and their own capabilities.Video series of films was made in the style of ""The Wrestler' a, simulating an amateur video of a combination of surreal fantasies of transforming the image of the heroine movie Nina Sayers.This inventive in its storytelling film-horror/triller about ballet keeps in suspense until its strange, creepy and compelling finale.

"Brutally seductive, seductively brutal","Aronofsky has proved himself by now to be a filmmaker of total and utter fearlessness, beyond brazen in his choices and the dazzling execution thereof, the innovative and consistently dependable master Shyamalan wished he could be, and with Black Swan, he takes Natalie Portman - and us - for the ride of a lifetime.Any film which has the deliriously gorgeous - and also consistently dependable - Portman in nearly every frame is worth plunking down cash for, and if you throw in the fact that she plays a reality-challenged and sexually repressed ballet dancer torn between her loyalty to her mommy and her desire to please her ballet director, who needs her to access her dark side - starting with her sexuality - in order to portray both the White Swan and her alter ego, the Black Swan in his production of Swan Lake, you've got yer basic on screen goldmine, and Aronofsky mines this gold for every nugget it's worth and then some.We know going in that Nina has a less-than-firm grip on reality - this is shown early on in a variety of ways - so by the time we're not sure anymore what's actually happening and what's delusion, it makes perfect sense. This is not a movie that skirts the issues - this is the full-blown, in-yer-face genuine article, with no holds barred.Others have called it the female version of The Wrestler and I would say this is valid, in its brutal depiction of how far a person will go in order to achieve and/or preserve his or her life choices or artistic vision. In Nina's case, she gives everything - literally - for merely one night of glory, the price her split psyche has had to pay for 'perfection', and on this level the movie works as a parable, a cautionary tale of obsession, a theme which resonates in all the movies Aronofsky has given us, from Pi on. It also works on the levels of melodrama, horror, sexually repressed psychosis, fear of failure, loss of innocence, all this and more, and in the hands of any other filmmaker I can think of it would have been laughable. In the theatre I saw it in, today, at the end, as the credits rolled, nobody was laughing.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Intense...uncomfortable at times, but foremost beautiful","After seeing the trailer for Aronofsky's latest release I expected nothing less than the usual fantastic uneasy viewing and a feeling of almost sickness, yet awe, at what I'd just seen, I've come to expect from his directorials. Disappointed, I wasn't.The film encapsulates you instantly in the beautiful, albeit competitive, realm of ballet and the impressive aural accompaniment provided by the every present Clint Mansell keeps thing expectantly intense throughout.Darren's usual chromatography style isn't lost in Black Swan although it isn't as prominent as in some previous releases such as Requiem For A Dream and The Fountain. Instead Aronofsky chooses to focus on attacking the sense with beautiful musical compositions and intense imagery.The casting is superb all round but Portman is the stand out act in this screenplay, with a deftness to go from fragile to intense at a whim and the ability to make the audience care for her from the beginning, bring together an incredibly intense and consistent performance.My only criticism of the film would be the over-use of far too obvious and blatant metaphors. It will become apparent upon viewing, but I believe Aronofsky may have chosen to take this route due to the under performance of some previous films i.e. The Fountain which are complex in nature, but understandable after repeat viewings, therefore making the film more accessible to the general public.As a long time Aronofsky fan, it was always going to be difficult for this film to be a disappointment, yet at the same time I had very high expectations. But as with all of his films, the subject of the film can be irrelevant to most, you don't have to like ballet to enjoy this film, you just have to like beautiful, intense and incredible cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Driven more by style than character, this will alienate some but pays off if you take it all in","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningNina (Natalie Portman) is a shy, nervous girl whose passion is performing ballet. In the face of stiff competition from more confident, forward girls, she wins the lead role in an up-coming production of Swan Lake in New York City, when demanding instructor Leroy (Vincent Cassel) drops older performer Beth (Winona Ryder) and invites her in. It's from here she becomes friendly with co star Lily (Mila Kunis), a more spirited girl who evokes emotions in her previously untapped. But the better Nina does, the more she is pushed and the more her strive to achieve perfection drives her dangerously over the edge and she finds her sanity waning.Despite the rave reviews and the numerous awards they've won, I saw neither Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler (which makes this film even stranger!) or Black Swan at the cinema, and had to wait to see them on DVD. This may make their scope smaller to me in the eyes of some, since being on 'the big screen' is what the 'big films' of whatever day they're released in most will remember seeing them on. Luckily, Aronofsky, whichever way you look at it, is a director with talent, and he makes films where this manages to shine through in whichever format you see them in. There are a good few who would have missed his smaller, more independent but critically acclaimed effort Requiem for a Dream (which I've never seen!) but The Wrestler managed to be a far more mainstream effort and was an undoubted work of brilliance, one of, if not the, best film of the 00s many claim. But while that worked as a character study of a man adored by loads he doesn't know but seen as greatly flawed by those who are supposed to be closest to him, Black Swan is a film driven more by atmosphere and claustrophobia, or rather an impending and illogical sense of these things. In many ways it is also a character study, of a girl with great untapped talent and potential, whose innocent and sincere determination to be the best at what she does, at odds with her deep insecurity and fundamental lack of belief in herself, pushes her over the edge, but it's delivery, at least at the beginning, is as such that it makes it hard to get into and may alienate some viewers from the off set.That the performances are so fantastic is for sure a bonus point, Portman in the lead role great as the central protagonist, a Carrie White style character still living with a domineering and controlling mother (Barbara Hershey) who hasn't let her really grow up and experience the world, whose shyness and vulnerability never really seem to go away as she progresses further and has to battle with her mounting delusions, and secondary mentions must go to Cassel as the archetypal slave driving instructor, a man prepared to push his lead star to a nervous breakdown in his quest to get the best out of his play and, more selflessly, her, while co stars Kunis and, in a far more minor role, Ryder also compliment the overall flavour of things. Unlike The Wrestler, it doesn't work as well telling a story as it does being a movie revolving around a sense of style and atmosphere that may be lost on some but which is there if you pay close enough attention. ****",,Anonymous,Drama

The Black Swan,"I watched Black Swan from director Darren Aronofsky starring Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, Winona Ryder and Barbara Hershey last night. I jumped and screamed like it was Friday the 13th. It's not really a horror but more of a suspenseful thriller. It's about a New York City ballet company that is producing Swan Lake, and the pressure Nina (Portman) puts on herself for reaching the lead role. Nina lives with Erica (Hershey), her overbearing mother and a former ballerina. Nina finds competition in new dancer Lily (Kunis). Swan Lake requires a ballerina who can play the innocent White Swan, which fits Nina, and the sensual Black Swan, which fits Lily. The dancers' rivalry changes into a bizarre friendship, and Nina begins exploring a dark side of herself. Nina's obsession with the role transforms her, not only on stage but also in her life.Darren Aronofsky floods the screen with images of mirrors and reflections. Is Nina portraying the Swan Queen or has it become a reflection of Nina? Aronofsky's choice for hand-held also adds to the realism of the action.Your not going to be screaming in fear, but definitely at the edge of your seat in suspense at the lengths Nina will go to be perfect. Also Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis totally do it, which makes the movie perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Director's duo versus Natalie's trinity,"The first 30 minutes of the film is really well intended and constructed - a dark side of the beautiful reality. Following the camera work, elements poured into the shots I have been expecting very twisted plot, terrific acting and directing. Natalie Portman's role gets warm up quickly and is already in full shape in the characters build-up. It should have been a great movie.The trinity of Natalie Portman, Nina and Black Swan is a very interesting part and I'm not sure if this is the original idea of the director; if not, then he should thank Natalie Portman for being so intricate in herself and the character mix-up. She works very hard in that playing Nina as a great ballerina, just as hard as Nina trying to catch Black Swan spirit with her own White Swan blood. Pushing herself to the corner or the limit, Nina really gets no better way out to understand what Black Swan is actually about, though Thomas Leroy is using his ""cheap"" way to seducing her thinking this would make her let go what she's possessing. Natalie Portman is comparatively under a much more difficult state of mind than Nina as she has to figure out how to transform herself into a perfect Nina who in turn is eager to find another ego in herself helping her to be in the role of Black Swan. The difficulties Natalie Portman faces is the plot actually doesn't provide enough build-up and space for her to understand such a complicated state and so she has to rely much on her own imagination about the role where the movie or the screen play hasn't provided yet. To be fair, Natalie Portman has saved the movie.It seems the director purposely trying to underline sex as the key point about Nina's let go. The way Thomas is speaking about Nina's deficiency in the play (the White Swan is perfect but the Black Swan isn't there) matches the director's underestimation of the character's intricacy, both are so simple in thinking and don't bother to give more thought into what Nina should be. If Thomas has let Nina work on her own how to find the Black Swan spirit, the director has left Natalie Portman alone in the movie struggling around the trinity relationship of herself, Nina & Black Swan. This sounds interesting enough though, as the duo of the director and Thomas versus the trinity of Natalie Portman, Nina and Black Swan succeeds in giving the movie a newer perspective which the audiences wouldn't have given much thought into it. Has it been an original idea of the director? I don't know but the movie really provides such an angle for me to look into it at least.The movie begins in a very artistic way but it lasts not more than 30 minutes. It could have become a really ""Dark"" movie but it seems the director doesn't want it be that, so in the last 20 minutes he has turned the movie into a typical thriller. I particularly don't like the way Nina finishes off herself. She should have been really into Black Swan and ends up together with it. Now she's no more than a schizophrenic patient. It should have been more than that.",,Anonymous,Drama

"Has a very nightmarish dream quality to it, which is one of the highest compliments you can pay a film (in my opinion)!","'BLACK SWAN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Darren Aronofsky, the mastermind director behind such classic films as 'THE WRESTLER', 'REQUIEM FOR A DREAM', 'PI' and 'THE FOUNTAIN', brings us another masterpiece, this time revolving around the world of ballet. It's written by Andres Heinz, John J. McLaughlin and Mark Heyman (a buddy of Aronofsky's; co-producer on 'THE WRESTLER' and writer of his upcoming film 'MACHINE MAN'). It stars Natalie Portman, my favorite actress, who turns in an amazing performance and is the Oscar front-runner for best actress this year (which will be her first win and long overdue in my opinion). It costars Mila Kunis (who is also expected to pick up a best supporting actress Oscar nomination), she's came a long way from 'THAT 70's SHOW' and it might be interesting to note that Portman's co-star in her next film is Ashton Kutcher (Kunis's bf on the show.). Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder also co-star.Like 'THE WRESTLER' this film is another story about one's obsession with their given art form. Instead of wrestling this film centers on ballerina but they kind of play out in strikingly similar fashions, if you think about it, especially the ending. Portman plays Nina, a ballerina in New York City who is obsessed with dancing. When the top dancer Beth (Ryder) is retired due to her age Nina is the director's top choice to replace her for the next production of 'Swan Lake'. The problem is that Nina fits the role of the innocent White Swan perfectly but is unable to lose herself in the performance enough to play the darker more sensual Black Swan. So when new dancer Lily (Kunis) represents the talent needed to perform the dark role the rivalry becomes bitter between the two and warps into a weird friendship. To top it off Nina has to deal with her over controlling mother (Hershey) who gave up her dancing career when she became pregnant with Nina.The movie above all has a very nightmarish dream quality to it, which is one of the highest compliments you can pay a film (in my opinion). It's a great throwback to the classic films of decades ago, almost Hitchcockian in style. It's very dark and disturbing and although it's a dramatic character study it's also a lot like a horror film in many ways. It's not as emotionally charged and inspiring as 'THE WRESTLER', in my opinion, but it's technically perfect on all other levels; an artistic masterpiece. Some critics of the film argue that it's so over the top in melodrama that it's unintentionally funny in many ways but I didn't find that to be the case. It's dark and dramatic and maybe a little too melodramatic to really resonate emotionally with the viewer but it's still a stunningly beautiful and captivating film to watch. Highlighted of course by Aronofsky's brilliant directing and Portman's Oscar worthy performance, probably the best of the year!Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVckRO-OANw",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Breath-taking cinematography,"Natalie Portman, Vincent Cassel, and Mila Kunis star in the psychological thriller Black Swan, which was directed by Darren Aronofsky and written by Gillian Flynn. Nina, a young ballerina played by Natalie Portman, is driven to the edge of insanity as she prepares for the main part in a staging of ""Swan Lake."" The tale is told through the lens of the film.As Nina, Natalie Portman gives a performance that is nothing short of spectacular, while Vincent Cassel and Mila Kunis are more than capable of holding their own beside her. Both the cinematography, which was done by Matthew Libatique, and the choreography, which was done by Benjamin Millepied, are breathtaking.But what really distinguishes Black Swan from other films is the way in which it examines the shadowy side of perfection and the thin line that separates sanity from insanity. The intelligent and well-written screenplay that was co-written by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John J. McLaughlin keeps the audience on the edge of their seats as they are dragged into Nina's increasingly strange and nightmare-like reality.Black Swan is an outstanding picture that is heightened by its excellent acting, breathtaking cinematography, and thought-provoking narrative. Overall, the film is a triumph. It is an absolute must-see for everyone who enjoys psychological thrillers and for anyone who is searching for a movie that will keep them wondering right up until the credits roll.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Starts Tense and Goes Nowhere,"I give this film credit for showing what it's like backstage in Ballet or in any of the performing arts. For every hour of dazzling performance, there are hundreds of hours of work, sweat and tears. It takes a lot of effort to look effortless.I will also congratulate the cinematographers - the camera work, especially the camera work showing balletic movement is terrific - you can almost feel what it's like to turn, jump and be lifted in space - bravo to them.The story is the problem. A psychological thriller that's not particularly thrilling. You can predict the outcome about the third time you see the character Nina confront herself in the mirror - which is probably not ten minutes into the film.Internal conflicts brought on by an overbearing mother, a demanding career, and facing the short lived career of a ballerina (few dancers dance professionally beyond their mid-30's), bring our heroine to a crisis that parallels her character as the Swan Queen.We watch Nina spiraling out of control, but the story has all the surprise of high school physics experiment.This ground has been covered many, many times (the 1978 movie ""Magic"", comes to mind). And it's been done better.It's worth watching for the ballet fans out there - there aren't enough ballet movies.

The plot follows a young ballerina, Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) in her quest to win the role of the Swan Queen in director Thomas Leroy's (Vincent Cassel) production of Tchaikovsky's famous ""Swan Lake."" Leroy has no doubt that Sayers can play the white swan, who is nubile and innocent, but doubts her ability to play the black swan, who is darker, more sexually charged, and less refined. When Sayers wins the role, she feels pressure from her overbearing mother and the demanding director Leroy to enact the ""perfect"" performance. Added to that pressure is Sayers' suspicion that her alternate, Lily (played by the lovely Mila Kunis of That 70's Show fame) is plotting to take her place and is in fact preferred by the director.Black Swan takes the viewer inside the often depressing world of professional ballet dancers, where the pressure not only to perform ""perfectly"" but also to look ""perfect"" seem to reach incomprehensible levels. Sayers, who is bulimic, another underlying problem in the world of professional ballet, is played wonderfully by the beautiful and ever-maturing Natalie Portman. It should also be noted that Cassel (whose appearance in mainstream cinema is long overdue) and Kunis (who deserves and will likely get more prominent roles in the future) are both perfectly suited for their roles as well. Aronofsky's use of light to depict good and evil is both obvious (at its most basic, contrasting the white and black swans) and subtle (lighting of various scenes, use of mirrors, clothing, etc.) and most importantly serves to clarify Nina's psychological turmoil.While Portman and Aronofsky serve up a thrilling and troubling final act, the most disturbing character in the film is Nina Sayers' mother, played by Barbara Hershey. The bright, happy, mother-daughter relationship depicted in the first act of the film are nothing more than a guise for what lies just under the surface between these two characters. Hershey plays the role of the over-protective mother to perfection, but her character indeed goes beyond that. By the second act, the viewer has the sense that the mother has also established firm psychological control over Nina, and is living her own (short-lived) ballet career vicariously through her daughter, placing additional pressure on the already deeply troubled Nina.Despite the outstanding performances by Hershey, Cassel, and Kunis, and perhaps the year's best directing by Aronofsky, the film, and particularly its final act, belong to Natalie Portman. Portman's real talent here is her ability to portray an incredibly wide range of human emotions in a relatively short period of time. The viewer not only sees but even feels her obsession, her pain, her loneliness, her sexual repression, and ultimately her pursuit of unattainable perfection. The viewer can see the pressure on young Nina building from all sides, but one clearly senses that the greatest pressure is that which the ballerina places upon herself. Her descent is thus rooted in this internal struggle rather than on the external pressures, making the final thirty minutes all the more terrifying.Overall, Aronofsky has succeeded once again at using his medium to create a visceral experience that allows the viewer to see and feel a wide variety of human emotions. His use of light and symbolism are without compare, at least among this year's crop of films. Aronofsky allows a glimpse into the human psyche that probably follows more closely along the lines of Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain, rather than The Wrestler, but may be a better overall film than all of the above.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Pursuit of Perfection,"To really appreciate Black Swan, you have to have the soul of an artist to understand the psychological labor that true artists go through in order to produce a ""perfect"" piece of art. The movie depicts this process and succeeds in capturing the fine line between art and insanity.Nina (Natalie Portman), an aspiring ballerina, gets the role of her life as the Swan Queen in the universally acclaimed ballet The Swan Lake. Being an inexperienced introvert and a stiff dependent, Nina finds it easy to embody the role of the innocent White Swan but extremely difficult to embody its evil counterpart: the seductive Black Swan. As a result, the show director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), pushes her to dig deeper in herself and discover her own sexuality. In the meantime, Nina is totally obsessed with the new dancer, Lily (Mila Kunis), who joins the company and charms everybody with her spontaneity, playfulness, and sexual appeal. Lily becomes everything Nina is missing, everything she wants to be, i.e. the Black Swan!At this point, the story of the ballet intertwines with reality, and Nina's daily life turns into a daily struggle to win the approval of the director by breaking the curse of the White Swan she is trapped in. Nina becomes completely indulged in the ballet that she loses the ability to distinguish between what's real and what's not. Such psychological conflict is beautifully symbolized in Nina's visions and role-giving to people in her life, and in her constant attempts to revolt against and break free from her mother and her meek self, so that she can let the Black Swan take control of her. All for the sake of art.. Perfect Art.The movie is fraught with symbolism and psychological undertones, a trademark of any Darren Aronofsky work, that the average movie viewer probably will not tolerate. Nevertheless, I think this is Aronofsky's masterpiece and his finest so far. His ability to bring such dark and unreachable artistic desires on screen and merge them with visual beauty is stunning! Every scene in the movie is a painting to be studied and taught.Natalie Portman's mind-blowing performance deserved every ounce of the Oscar she won for this role. This girl has it all: talent, charm, beauty, grace, intelligence and maturity. Kunis and Cassel were both playful and charming, being comfortable in their seemingly tailor-made roles.And just to make everything perfect, and leaving me nothing to criticize, Clint Mansell adds his god-like touches to the movie's score turning it into a transcendental audio-visual piece of art.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
This review may contain spoilers:,"The film Black Swan shows that the mind has a special aptitude for greatness; however, once pushed to the limit, it can also become vulnerable and pose countless problems. Everyone is exposed to instability, especially if our environment or our life experiences becomes a factor. Our minds are beautiful but complex. Natalie Portman behaves as an unstable young girl, 'Nina Sayers', who is longing for acceptance by her aggressive artistic director 'Thomas Leroy', played by Vincent Cassel; in this twisted story of determination and fate.Nina's surprising transformation and boldness immediately captures a once uncertain Thomas' attention; and she lands the main role as the white and black swan. Trying to manage the two personalities proved to be a difficult situation, as she plunged into character. Nina quickly spindled out of control in a challenge that was evidently too much for her to control. The Black Swan is strikingly similar to 'A beautiful mind' in many ways. John Nash a very talented and brilliant mathematician played by Russell Crow, shows how the mind can and will shift if strained and overworked. Both movies show the artistry in humans; however, it also shows the vulnerability of the human mind.The environment choice used was contributive in setting the mood of this movie. The lighting in the movie was always dark and the rooms always felt small. Viewers felt a feeling of entrapment in the small apartment, and routed for Nina's freedom. There are several motifs that contribute to the theme of this film, particularly visual motifs. In the film Nina hallucinates quite frequently. This allowed the viewers to understand what she felt. One motif in particular, is when Nina imagined that she had sex with her team mate Lilly, who she almost lost her role to. She confronted Lilly in a rage, wondering why she left without waking her. At that time she recognized that she had imagined the entire scene.Another visual motif was when she hallucinated about stabbing Lilly to death, and then hiding her body. In reality she had stabbed her self. Nina died as a result.No one in direct connection with Nina was prepared for her untimely death. Although her mother knew that she was not feeling well. This came as a big surprise for everyone. This film shows that at any given time the human mind can become clouded, no matter the person's persons intelligence or perseverance.",,Anonymous,Drama

I GIve My Recommendation,"Maybe Arronofsky's best work. Better than The Wreslter and comparable to Requiem For A Dream. The film is dark, symbolic, outlandish, beautiful, striking, and successfully stylistic.Finally, Portman gets the recognition she deserves. Her presence in Black Swan is magical. The conclusion I draw in her method approach to the role and the very method upon which Arronofsky exhumes from the transformation of Nina Sayers into the Black Swan is the very embodiment of Heath Ledger's process in becoming The Joker or De Niro's earliest work with Scorsese. It gives the audience a chance to understand the deep and genius nature an artist must succumb to justify their work. It is the very portrayal of Van Gogh and others. Are they ahead of their time or are others stuck in the past? Something to ponder......",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Awful Mess,"I hated every single minute of this torturous endless take on ballet, gossips, hate, split personality, scheming,sexual innuendos,dull music, vague plot, predictable twists, extremely bad choice of color scheme and very silly ending. Well, that seems to be a sum of all evil in that Aronofsky's horrible movie, that is very slow, pathetic, never engaging, never thrilling and never convincing. It does not persuade to go and watch ballet, or try to perceive Swan Lake better. Nay, in fact, thyme filmmakers killed any hint of interest to this. This boggy plodding mess is not a decent take on mental disease, either. It does not provide any deep picture or awake any sympathy to any of the heroes. In fact, it is so cold, detached, distanced and bleak that all the possible attempt to like ballet will die immediately. Waste of time, and all the parts are very weak too - neither Portman, nor Kassel, Ryder, Kunis or else did anything to get us involved. It is so vapid and dry that next idea would be to get and watch some light-weight comedy or something",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
Spellbinding movie about the cut-throat and sometimes unstable world of a ballerina,"Ballerinas appear on the stage: graceful, strong, beautiful, and above all, simply effortless. This movie jolts you into the real world, the real work, the very real insecurities of these fairytale dancers. The harsh reality of being a prima ballerina being replaced through no fault of your own; your body just won't take the constant abuse, the long hours, and the mental strain of trying to grasp perfection. The pressure of being the new ingénue. Work harder, be stronger, DO NOT crack under the pressure of trying to be perfect, yet trying with all your heart to make this dance uniquely your own. Never trusting your comrades because even though you are the up and coming star, there is always someone waiting in the wings to fill your slippers. Push push push have to be the best no matter how much it hurts no matter how tired I am, I WILL BE the number one prima ballerina! This movie gave a very real sense of the pressures professional ballet dancers go through. They may not hallucinate or go crazy as in this most excellent movie, I am most delighted that this movie did not candy coat the profession. Bravo and I gave it a 9 star rating. Would have liked to see Winona Ryder a little more, then it would have been a 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A classic that respects the classics!,"I ran into a former student as I left the theater. I walked right past him. He stopped me. ""You all right?"" he asked. I came out of my near trance and said, ""Doppelganger."" ""That's what I was thinking, too!"" he exclaimed. And so we talked about Marlow and Kurtz in HEART OF DARKNESS and the Captain in THE SECRET SHARER and, of course, Nina and Lily in BLACK SWAN. I was totally mesmerized, totally immersed, totally shaken and stirred. If Marlowe settled for ""the nightmare of my choosing,"" I'm overwhelmed with this nightmare of Aronofsky's directing. I could go on about Captain Ahab and the theme of obsession or Kafka and the twisted madman distortion of one's view of the self, but BLACK SWAN is not derivative of these great works, nor an homage, but rather a unique journey into the darkness in all of our souls.

An Inspiring Film from a Nightmare.,"Darren Aronofsky really achieved something this time in the form of an exquisite masterpiece, Black Swan. Natalie Portman really does give an outstanding performance.The film's tone is very similar to the dark psychological tones of Roman Polanski's films (e.g. Rosemary's Baby, The Tenant). Portman's performance defines a generation of actresses and gives it her all.The whole psychology of the film is very disturbing. The film is very strange, as to where to fall under, genre-wise. It's considered a drama but in the likes of psychological horror or psychological thriller.The shaky camera-work also distills a terrifying look into Portman's character's psyche. My recommendation is to watch this film under stress, because at the end, all the weight will be lifted off your shoulders and you will be liberated.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

High-brow horror hits you in the gut,"The ""Black Swan"" is perhaps one of the most highly-stylized and incredibly subtle horror films ever made. It appears to disguise itself as a drama but is in fact a surreal nightmare--an extremely claustrophobic one. It is incredibly brutal and horrific on a much deeper level than any genre film. Here the horror is psychological and emotional. Yet still impacts you with real ""jump-in-your-seat"" fright. I'm glad I did not see the trailer before I saw the film. I was expecting a story about an ambitious ballerina...so glad I got something much more complex and layered with lasting resonance.It is an outstanding film in all aspects of craftsmanship and deserves its accolades. It is tightly paced and never lets up from start to finish. Whatever the quibbles are about this film, it cannot be denied that it grips you hard and you are not on steady ground until you leave the theatre, much like the haunted house at an amusement park. Except with the ""Black Swan"", the horror is high-brow. It cuts through your faculties of reason and hits you right in the gut. A stunning achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Most Ballet I've Ever Watched,"Ballerina and princess. I'd say those are the top two career goals of little girls. If one such aspiring little girl were to watch ""Black Swan"" they'd think that Nina Sayer (Natalie Portman) was living the dream, except it was more like she was living a nightmare.Nina Sayer wanted with every fiber of her being to play the lead swan in the ballet ""Swan Lake."" She was good enough and pretty enough, but ballet director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) didn't think she had quite enough to be the black swan (the alter ego to the white swan). She needed to ""lose herself"" in order to truly embody the emotion and persona of the black swan on stage. Nina was too quiet, too meek, too perfect. She wasn't bold and defiant. She still lived with her mother and had a room filled with dolls and pink decor like a little girl. Could she push the boundaries of her personality and be the black swan? That's what we were all waiting to see.Watching Nina quite literally lose herself as she tried to be the black swan reminded me of Heath Ledger. How many artists dive so deeply into their art to give us, the adoring fans, what we want? And how many lose themselves mentally and emotionally as a result of that deep dive?""Black Swan"" gave us a first person view of a performer giving her all to be the best, to stay on top, and to give the director and the audience what they wanted. It was akin to watching the movie ""Joker"" in which the eponymous character descended into madness. There aren't many compliments I can pay this movie that haven't already been paid by the thousands of raters. All I can say is that this is the most ballet I've ever watched in my life.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great story about a story,"This movie has 2 outstanding, almost perfect elements: the poster (it has a bit of ""hauntingly beautiful"" to it) and the idea. And while the storytelling is not perfect it does deliver and near the ending all it has been built up bursts in a crescendo of action and emotion. While most of the movie Natalie Portman acts like she is made of wood, you know like in Star Wars, this time it actually fits as she is supposed to be somewhat stiff and just mimicking emotions. However her transformation into the black swan at the end really surprised me and leads me to think she can actually act. And pretty well too.Now jumping on to the supernatural elements some of them seem very well in place like an unexplained rash and bleeding of fingers, through impressions of seeing a familiar face on the street, to hallucinations while on drugs and an actual transformation into a black swan on stage some others like hallucinations in the hospital and before the show could have been handled subtler or more masterfully. For example in the cabin as I didn't understand what exactly was happening anymore it ruined immersion and made me not care anymore. Fortunately the beautiful performance follows that rescues and finally manages to create a nearly perfect ending.However, there is one fault I find in it... the fact that watching the trailer or reading a two-line review basically renders the first hour of the movie useless, it adds surprisingly little. Fortunately it didn't get actually boring.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A Bit Over-hyped, But Still a Solid Film","A ballerina (Natalie Portman) finally gets the big break in Swan Lake as the swan queen. But she starts having mental breaks where her personality shifts more from the white swan to the black swan.The way this film has been hyped as an Oscar film is unfortunate. I just do not see that level of power here. Natalie Portman (playing Nina Sayers) is deserved of a best actress nomination and probably a win, and deserves one for her devotion to the role and the injuries she took during training and filming.Winona Ryder absolutely deserves a supporting actress nomination for her role as Beth Macintyre, and perhaps even the win. Ryder had her glory days in the early and mid-1990s, but I do not think she was ever taken seriously as an actress. While her part in this film is small, I think it is her best work to date.Mila Kunis plays Lily the understudy. I have a personal love of Kunis, and think she is gorgeous. How strong her acting is, I do not know, and I hate to say it, but she may have been the weak point of the entire film and one of the reasons I cannot see giving it a ""best picture"" nomination. How she is getting supporting actress nominations from various organizations is beyond me.Director Darren Aronofsky has a respectable career, starting with such critical successes as ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"". Both of these films I feel is better than ""Black Swan"". Some people love ""The Fountain"" while others find it pretentious. I lean more towards the latter. And even here, with ""Swan"", I think he borders on the pretentious. There is a fine line between making art and making high-minded bull, and this film teeters on that line.Although I do not think it is as great as some see it, at least I do not hold some sort of intestinal hatred for it like Steve Erickson, the critic for ""Gay City"", does. He says the film has ""over-the-top combinations of bombastic music, shakycam, and quick editing"" with ""all the soul of a Skinemax exercise"". He finds the film ""not very enjoyable to watch"", in part because ""Aronofsky has no gift for eroticism"" and ""seems to see sex as a necessary but degrading part of human experience."" Erickson is quite wrong, but this becomes obvious the moment he admits that he finds ""Requiem"" to be ""irritating"" and never saw it all the way through. What sort of critic can judge a director whose works he has no stomach for?If you do not see this film, I do not think you are missing out. However, it has some strong points and anyone who is a fan of Aronofsky really needs to check this out. That, or if you want to see an emaciated Portman being a sexual creature... but if that is all you watch it for, you are missing the point.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
you should already know what this movie is about,"It was visceral, truncated, reminded a lot of Harold and Maude; please don't ask me why. The film flew about the topics of awareness and psychological and professional adventitiousness but it did not dwell for too long. I saw 'Nina' as having an exacerbated and untreated DID (disassociated identity disorder) or what we used to call an MP (multiple personality). But then again, maybe not; maybe its all exegesis. The film was brilliant and my first Aronofsky for the most part. I realize the budget was low but I lost a little in the digital image. The sound for the film made it up in a big way. I enjoyed the film on a gut level and the characters became like caricatures in a certain respect which I attribute to the image and screenplay. As far as being a psychological drama, it didn't really offend my sense of people with mental illness. In conclusion I applaud Aronofsky for not hamming up the titles which follow people with mental illness their entire lives, the subtlety was necessary and appreciated. It screened like a dream to me, albeit a nightmare, but a well wrought stripped down visceral dream.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
What's the big deal? (A regular guy's review of Black Swan),"Be wary, fellow viewers. All that is flashy and over-hyped is NOT gold.This is not the great movie that it has been made out to be in the reviews. It's not a BAD movie as such, it just isn't a masterpiece as some would have you think. Maybe it's the details of Natalie Portman's training in ballet that have people ooh-ing and ah-ing. Maybe it's the fact it's directed by Darren Aranofsky, a man who's undoubtedly a flavor of the moment. Maybe it's just the fact that a lot of women really, REALLY like ballet. I don't know.But to this reviewer, Black Swan came off as trite and pretentious. This is a story that's been told before, and better. And about subject matter that will probably appeal to a greater audience. Did I mention this movie is about ballet? Because it is. About 85% so, in fact. So, if you're one of the many people out there who are about as interested in ballet as you are in the lichen-per-square meter count of a cave system under Norway, you'll probably spend a good deal of this movie wondering what the fuss is about.The director has clearly put a lot of effort into making sure that the theme of main character Nina's inner turmoil runs deep throughout this movie, but it's almost as if he was so focused on this theme that he forgot about little things like pacing, execution and style. The camera work is particularly annoying, filmed in that familiar 'shaky-cam' style to impress a sense of discord and turmoil to the viewer, but ultimately, you just wish they'd hold the damn camera still. The dialogue is wooden and forgettable and the characters seem fairly one-dimensional and cliché: all the cast is here - the incredibly high pressure and high maintenance mother, the authoritarian Boss who's constantly hitting on Nina, and even Nina herself fits into the 'not-quite-perfect' princess mold... Being able to display differing shades of 'distraught' doesn't make for an award-winning performance. In fact, it's just tiring to watch. Also, and this may just be the acting of Natalie Portman, but the scenes that were overtly sexual or violent in nature seemed completely out of place. We don't see any progression into these outbursts of intense emotion, no slow downward spiral or anything like that, they just HAPPEN, as if the director felt the need to grab you by your ears and scream into your face: ""HEY! SHE'S GOING CRAZY! DO YOU GET IT YET?!?""And again, this reviewer can't stress enough the point about how you WILL have to at least be interested in ballet to watch this film, because that's all there is at stake here: a good opening night performance. That is essentially the only tangible obstacle that Nina faces in this entire movie. And the film emphasizes this point by dedicating the vast majority of the time on screen to discussing various ballet-related backstory and other ballet-related plot developments. By the time Nina's character finally DOES start to show some signs of 'cracking up', you almost welcome it, if only for those precious few seconds where you won't be listening to more ballet-related trivia.While there are some effective scares, and some special effects worthy of mention, really, this film rides entirely on the viewers interest in a particular lifestyle (ballet) - if you are one of the many women who's ever dreamed of being a ballet dancer, then that's probably you. The rest, however, probably won't understand why they just spent 108 minutes watching a film about a woman stressing over her ballet performance.Nobody is saying ballet isn't hard, it surely is. But if an astronaut can handle a very real risk of dying every time they're called into duty, it's kind of difficult to relate to a story about a ballet dancer who simply can't handle 'the pressure', even if she IS a headcase. 4/10",,Anonymous,Drama

"Intense, frothy melodrama saved from pretension by tight direction","My hat goes off to Natalie Portman for what was the most convincing and obviously committed portrayal of a professional ballerina and her inner life I've seen. Not that I know any professional ballerinas, but the best thing about Black Swan is that in spite of straying very close to the line where tortured artists look ridiculous on screen, it doesn't let up the cinematic feast for a minute, and so your disbelief is maintained. Reminiscent in a way of the Vincent van Gogh biopic Lust for Life, which on paper is as corny as heck, but still manages to convey his tragedy and inform everybody's (who's not an art historian) perception of that painter. Black Swan will inform everybody's perception of prima ballerinas for a long time. The Red Shoes trod similar ground (play on words intended), but far less accessibly than this. Black Swan works as a melodrama - meaning a drama where the characters are unexamined and stereotypical - because it is constantly exciting to look at, and the Steadicam work is reasonably restrained so those of us used to Jean Renoir films don't get nauseous. Nina's story seems to be an allegory of a woman discovering her own physical sexuality (I don't know if IMDb accepts the V word), and this aspect of the film is mercifully not overplayed, because then it would certainly be pretentious. Black Swan's sheer style manages to keep it enjoyable as a cinematic spectacle; it will not transfer well to DVD because the characters and story are pretty much out of the 'Fame' script vault.Let me pick at it now: everyone in the cinema laughed when Nina dragged the body across the floor - I think it was the tutu that did it.'My new production of Swan Lake', says Thomas. I know the film wasn't about the production itself, but Thomas' production looked pretty goldarned pedestrian to me.The mother's teeth? Those will haunt me longer than Natalie Portman's arm-waving, I have to say. Don't take it too seriously, don't laugh out loud and let your girl/gayfriend wallow in what might have been. I just wish French and Saunders, the UK comedy duo, were still around to give us their take.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Black Swan=Gold statue,"Like many of Aranofskys films"" Black Swan"" is also about a very flawed broken character that is trying to achieve something that is larger than life. This film is a meditation on the world of Ballet and the competitive nature of the dance form. It is very cerebral and you walk out of the theater a bit dazed. There is no doubt it will have an effect of the viewer, whatever that may be for that individual, depending on you respond to the film. It's essentially the story of Nina (played by Natalie Portman with bravado and incredible vulnerability) and her quest to become the Swan Queen of Tchaikovsky's ballet ""Swan Lake"" and do justice to it. This role of a lifetime requires her to not only play the white swan but its antithesis the Black Swan which requires her to let go of her inhibitions and be free. Can she pull this off? Her mentor Thomas (played with gusto by Vincent Cassel) has doubts and pushes her in every way to the point where he comes off creepy and arrogant, but it ultimately helps her achieve her goal. This journey to become ""perfect"" proves to be a daunting task as Nina has pressure from all around. Her mother is vicariously living through her and won't let her little princess get sidetracked. It is also suggested that Nina might have some Psychological issues, which would justify some of the gruesome scenes in the film but it's never stated, keeping the audience guessing. There is also a rival dancer played by Mila Kunis who oozes with sexuality and is a big distraction for Nina and of course she has her own insecurities and hallucinations to deal with. Technically, this film is brilliant. The film mostly focuses on close up shots of Natalie Portman and everything she goes through. The audience really feels like they are living this world with her. It's a very intimate experience. One thing Aronofsky achieves with this is giving us a total immersive experience in to the world of Ballet, no 3D glasses needed. I felt like I had done a week of Ballet boot camp after watching it. The film eventually leads to a rousing conclusion and Ultimately ""Black Swan"" ends up being a very satisfying film. Portman spent 10 months preparing for this role and she very good in it. It will be an easy Oscar nomination for both Portman and director Aronofsky.

The only thing this film even had a chance at was the 'Best Actress' award for the terrific portrayal of Nina by Natalie Portman, which thank God it won.Where was the credit for Barbara Hershey, Mia Kunis and Vincent Cassel? As far as anyone was concerned Natalie Portman was the only one who deserved any recognition.This is a disturbing, nightmarish film in which the little details are crucial. I am not normally squeamish, but I found myself cringing at the sight and the sound of bones crackling, skin peeling and finger nails scratching.I feel that this film, like so many great films, will be a sleeper; and within the next 20 years it will be revealed to be one of the most artistically praiseworthy films since the end of film noir.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Excellent !!,"Words cannot describe Natalie Portman 's exceptional performance which in turn won her many awards including the well deserved Oscar and the Golden Globes to name a few. Not only did she portrayed the naïve childlike character Nina but at the same time excelled in her graceful performance as a ballerina as well for which she lost 20 pounds to look the part. Apart from her ballet dance classes she had when she was young, a dedicated Portman did ballet training for one year prior to shooting Black Swan. The 40 seconds long scene where she went into the toilet to call her mother with good news places her in a league of her own and did her justice as a top A Lister.Looking back at Portman's career, the dark challenging character she played in V for Vandetta does not do justice when you compare it with the character Nina. Portman told broadcast journalist Charlie Rose in an interview that one of the most difficult challenges was her childlike voice in the film which was one of the most outstanding aspects of her character performance.Mila Kunis and Wynona Rider added brilliant performance to the picture with their different characters and provided a much needed perspective on Nina's deteriorating sense of reality. Barbara Hershey provides a perfectly calculated performance as an infantilizing mother.Hats off to Darren Aronofsky for pulling a masterpiece together with his signature style shots that shows shots taken from behind the subject. There are certain aspects of Black Swan that can relate to his powerful film ""The Wrestler""(2008)which also portrays the lead struggling for excellence in his field.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
An Ambiguous Drama Film,"Many call this a psychological thriller, sometimes even a horror film. I believe it is those two, but it is mainly a psychological drama film at heart. A psychological drama with abundant symbolism and ambiguity. It is one of the most artful and beautiful films I have ever watched, and it has honestly blown me away.Natalie Portman plays her role to sweet perfection, as do the rest of the actors and actresses. They all, especially Portman, seem to actually become the characters, and lose themselves in their roles.The direction is spotless, and the camera-work is stunning. The colors and visuals are breathtaking, and the story is quite the marvel. Not everything is fully explained throughout the film; one must interpret it. The merging of the story of the film and the story of Swan Lake was flawlessly done. Also, contrary to popular belief, the film is not actually about ballet; it is about diving into the depths of insanity in order to produce perfection. The result is not pretty, but depicted very adeptly. A second viewing is recommendable.A passionate film, it can be very unsettling and at times goes into horror territory, but this is just one of the things that makes this film such a delicious piece of mysterious, ambivalent, and intelligent art. Again, it is a psychological thriller, but one should look past the scary scenes and become immersed into the beauty and the message that lies beneath the surface.The message that lies deep inside the water, that becomes warped and blurred, and can be read in many different ways in time. The message is still there, but not clear. Yet that makes this film so fascinating and charming.Definitely 10/10 stars",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Not too impressed,"A love-it-or-hate-it movie. Aronofsky blurs the line between reality and fantasy, turning the film into a Gothic horror show that is fascinating and disappointing in equal measure. Nothing is perfect; Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John J. McLaughlin's script does have beautiful and organic (and almost poetic) dialogue, but the film does have its moments where it feels over-saturated and some superfluous plot devices could have been scrapped. In addition, some minor side characters were a bit underdeveloped.Regardless of its flaws, none of which are necessarily damning, Black Swan marks an important chapter in director Darren Aronofsky's career. His direction (which reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's trademark technique — a compliment no doubt), alongside a beautiful score which consists of some of Swan Lake's most famous tunes, tie the film up very nicely, making it a true herculean masterpiece.",,Anonymous,Drama
Review - Black Swan,"Natalie Portman surely put a lot of dedication to this character, and I think that it paid off. It is both here finest performance ever and the tole that freed her from Padmé Amidala's shadow.The plot is amazing.

Nonetheless, that amount of precision harmed my viewing experience, I would have preferred to feel the film rather than have the impression to watch a still frame.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Cringe-worthy and intense... and little else,"This movie was hard to watch.That, in and of itself, doesn't make it bad. However, the fact a movie makes you look away in disgust every few minutes doesn't make it interesting, and that's about all I found myself doing for two hours.Even if you accept The Black Swan as a horror movie, which is about all I can understand it as, I thought the most cringe-worthy, intense moments were the (too frequent) close ups of bloody chunks of Natalie Portman's body falling off. This made the screen-filling shots of Portman finding new ways to simultaneously flex her neck muscles and tear glands lose power and relevance since the audience has already been numbed by all the gore... which renders beside-the-point her much hyped performance. (If all the movie does is make your stomach churn, and most of this is accomplished by the gross factor and not by method acting, what else are you left with?) To further the cheapening of the movie, the CGI goose bumps (swan bumps, to be more accurate) are pretty much totally unnecessary, though I guess they're almost (ALMOST) funny.About the only good thing (which still wasn't particularly rewarding to watch) was the intense relationship between Nina (Portman) and her mother.In short, everything about this movie is over the top. Perhaps this can be justified if you argue that the whole film is a sort of ""performance"" of Swan Lake, complete with costumes and exaggerated characters. This might explain unrealistic features like the presence of ""imprecise"" dancers with huge tattoos on their backs in important positions at a major metropolitan dance company. (I don't know anything about ballet, but ""imprecise"" and ""career"" seem like mutually exclusive concepts in a world I understand to be about as competitive as formula 1 auto racing... or becoming an astronaut.) But even if clichéd rebel dancers and virginal, pretty ones are ""characters"" in a ""performance,"" it doesn't make them interesting, and doesn't really justify their flatness.All in all, this film succeeds in making viewers feel uncomfortable.However, I found myself feeling little more than that.While I would actually have given the movie two or three stars out of 10, I gave it just one to compensate for all the gushing 10/10 reviews.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
My favourite Aronofsky to date,"It takes the terrestrial story of a ballerina desperate for the role of the Swan Queen in ""Swan Lake"", a part requiring her to dance both the white and black swan, and turns it into a psychosexual, brooding and horrific descent into a personal Hell. Aronofsky does clearly have a taste for the theme of a personal descent or journey; in some way or another the idea has been the subject of every film he has made so far. This could be a complaint about him being ""samey"", but he does it with such verve every time, each film so vivid and unique an experience on its own, it is impossible to moan.Upon seeing ""Black Swan"" the first time through, I found myself rather numb; the film is so vivid, I knew what I had seen was good, but it was hard for me to discern whether I had actually enjoyed it. Having seen it twice now, I can confirm it is a masterpiece; it moved me far closer to tears on a few occasions the second time through, and is my personal favourite of Aronofsky's work so far.What is fascinating about the film is that a lot of the ideas are long-held penchants of foreign art house and horror. Indeed, I take a rather sadistic pleasure, as a fan of the director, from the thought that a lot of people walking into the film, believing they are getting an average thriller, might be rather shocked by the unexpected elements. Once over the standard setup, the film rapidly takes you on a trip into a world of competition, obsession, self-harm, duality, sexuality, violence, psychosis and body-horror....oh, and overbearing mothers! We watch the whole thing through the eyes of Nina, played with ridiculous dedication and power by Natalie Portman, whilst the pressure of the role and obsession with being perfect ruins her mind, splits her personality, and drives her to ever-worsening degrees of paranoia. On the point of performances, I also give praise to the always-overlooked Vincent Cassel, whose acting I recognised, on second viewing, to be far more precise and thoughtful than I first gave credit for.Anybody familiar with his previous efforts, ""Pi"" and ""Requiem For A Dream"", will already know how well Aronofsky can put the broken psyche on screen, and anyone who has seen ""The Fountain"" and ""The Wrestler"" will understand how ambitious, daring, and emotional a filmmaker he is. With ""Black Swan"" he manages to inject all of those elements into one piece of cinema; it is intense, emotional, dark, upsetting, intimate and beautiful, haunting and bold. The colour schemes, the staging of scenes, Clint Mansell's original score, the editing and sound; everything is so well-orchestrated, with nearly every scene being essay-worthy, that although not always hugely original in his techniques with this one, Aronofsky has made a film so startling, so hard to forget, it is impossible to not be in complete awe by the time the credits role",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A masterpiece - not for me! Ingredients: creepiness, creepiness, creepiness!","I kept thinking whether I would rate this film with a 9 or an 8. I picked 9, for the best performance of an actress I have ever seen and for the Aronofsky specific directing skills. I will admit that this is probably the most intense movie I have ever seen.Nevertheless, I could have never rated this movie with a 10, because in my views it is not a work of art. Art should not create intense emotions of panic, depression... I believe I couldn't rate it with a 10 because it was actually a horror movie even if officially it is not a horror. But it is, and it is only depressing and spooky and it brings together all the creepiness you can find in this world of ours. Art should be encouraging, full of hope, should bring joy to the world, not creepiness, not fear, we can easily find these in the real world. Me, I prefer Roberto Benigni, whom I would love to watch over and over again.I would never watch Black Swan again, and if I would turn back the time, I wouldn't watch it for the first time.

Black Good and White Evil,"The philosophical idea of the film ""Black Swan""Azad JafariThe opposition of good and evil is one of the most important topics in philosophy and ethics - both absolute and compound (philosophy of ethics) - which has been the concern of thinkers for a long time and everyone has paid attention to it based on their knowledge of human existence. The movie ""Black Swan"" directed by Darren Aronofsky, which was one of the most notable films of the 2011 Oscars, had a similar view on the subject of the history of philosophy and ethics. But is ""Black Swan"" really a film about the opposition of good and evil?We must first have a clear definition of good and evil in order to make judgments about the content of the film. Certainly, in this brief, there is no time to deal with all that has been said in the history of philosophy - even briefly and catalogingly - and one must inevitably seek a particular conception that is more fundamental and original. If we look at the human position and the basic characteristics of human existence, the most basic criterion for distinguishing between good and evil, good and evil, is the privilege of human existence from other types, ie, ""free will"". With the exception of those who believe in causality or coercion, everyone agrees on the principle that man is inherently free, and therefore his free and selective action takes precedence over his non-free and imitative action. What, if man does not think and choose, he is no longer human. Human beings are the only beings who have time and are, so to speak, timeless. Because he has a future and can make his own tomorrow. The reason for this, is free will, and free will is the most important fruit of one's having the gift of wisdom. A human being whose present is like yesterday and whose tomorrow is like today has no future because his yesterday and today and tomorrow are the same. He just has a past like all other plant and animal creatures. Like a pine tree or a branch of wheat. Like bees that have been living the same way for millions of years, they are forced to make their inevitable historical predestination. Creatures no longer have time of their own, but are surrounded by earthly time. But man, except for the time of the earth, has a special time of his own because he thinks and chooses, and that is why in his definition, eloquence is considered as the distinguishing chapter from animalism. Angels, like animals, are timeless because they lack authority, and if they are good, they have not chosen this good themselves.Let us return to the main subject, the film ""Black Swan"", and the first question is whether the subject of this film is the opposition of good and evil? Fortunately, the film leaves us free to judge and has clear evidence that can be cited, saying that there is no good at all in this film that wants to oppose evil. The subject of ""Black Swan"" is the opposition of evil to evil, or if we want to see differently and explore the relationship in the work more radically, we say that the subject may be the opposition of good and evil, but not the good we think and not the evil we think. From the point of view of the film ""Black Swan"", the real good is the blackness that everyone calls evil, and the real evil is the whiteness that everyone thinks is good.To be white or good in Aronofsky's film is to be an angel. It means to act morally without any choice, free will and freedom. In contrast, blackness or evil is being human. That is, to commit immoral acts of one's own free will. The film ""Black Swan"" is a film in praise of evil (because it considers evil necessarily free and based on freedom) and in its condemnation of good (because it necessarily considers good as causal and based on captivity and predestination). Nina, played by Natalie Portman, is an innocent character, but not because she had a selfish desire to sin, but because she had no desire to sin at all. She is a blindfolded girl who, as a result of her mother's strict upbringing, cannot sin even if she wanted to. Is this captivity, this ignorance, and this obvious metamorphosis that is described as white in the film really good? And is that freedom, that awareness, and that vision that is going to come to him as a result of the strong search for the inner black, really evil? In ""Black Swan"" film, the place of good and evil has changed, meaning that the word good has a negative connotation and the word evil has a positive connotation. But is there a problem? Isn't Aronofsky really right?There is no doubt that consciousness and authority are good in themselves, and that ignorance and captivity are evil in themselves, but the question is whether there is a connection between moral action and coercion and immoral action with freedom. That is, does anyone who does not sin necessarily have to? Or is it possible to avoid sin and immorality with complete will and free will? And on the other hand, is anyone who sins necessarily free? Or is it possible to commit sin and immorality out of ignorance and coercion? The problem with ""Black Swan"" is that it presupposes whiteness by force, and black by choice, when there is no such thing.Immanuel Kant in ""Critique of Practical Reason"" writes: Awareness of the ""voluntary"" submission of the will to the law, with the inevitable limit which only our own intellect imposes on all inclinations, is the same as respect for the law. Obviously, the law that requires and induces this respect is nothing but the law of morality (because nothing else can prevent all desires from exerting any direct influence on the will). An act which, according to this law and has an objectively practical aspect in terms of the negation and rejection of any source that is obligatory of the type of desire, is called a ""duty"". (Critique of Practical Reason, Immanuel Kant)The two words ""voluntary"" and ""duty"" that are emphasized in these expressions indicate that moral duty is directly related to voluntary will and is inseparable from it. However, in ""Black Swan"", everything we see as good is without will and without awareness and authority, and in contrast, everything we see as evil is directly related to ""awareness of the voluntary submission of the will to the law."" But the law is not a law of morality but a law of immorality.Kant goes on to make another reference that is in line with this language and therefore contrary to the morality of Nina's action (which is described in the film Good and White). He says: The law of morality is the law of ""holiness"" for the perfect existing will. But for the will of every rational being, the law of ""duty"" is the law of moral restraint and the law of obliging one's actions by ""respecting"" this law and respecting one's duty. No other mental origin should be assumed as a motive, otherwise, although the act may be ironically the same as that prescribed by law, but because it was not issued for the task, the intention of this act, which is really the subject of this legislation, is debatable. ""It is not moral.""Therefore, Nina's innocence and innocence, because it is not preceded by moral intention and free will, cannot be moral and good, and can be an alternative to the conscious and voluntary choice of evil. Therefore, in the film ""Black Swan"", the comparison between good and evil is not a fair comparison, because in the cup of evil there is a heavy weight called authority, which has no place in the cup of good. Obviously, this unfair comparison will lead to incorrect results. Whether this is a deliberate and intentional incorrect result or unintentional and unwanted, In any case, ""Black Swan"" is the story of abandoning one evil to find another evil. There is no good here.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Nutshell Review: Black Swan,"It's clearly no surprise about the full house in today's sneak preview of Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan, given the buzz built from lead actress Natalie Portman's win at the Golden Globes, and various other Oscar nominations now surrounding it, including an outside chance of winning Best Picture come end of the month. And as if the slow mutilation of Portman's Nina isn't enough to chip away at her good girl persona and character, you can just about trust our local censors for wanting to get a piece of the action as well through exercising its scissors to mutilate the film in a critical scene between Mila Kunis and Portman when the latter ultimately experienced the crescendo of her letting go.I think many in my generation and older have seen how Natalie Portman has grown up in cinema, from her unforgettable introduction into the silver screen through Luc Besson's Leon the Professional, to the more adult role now offered by Darren Aronofsky to push her boundaries, and in a case of life imitating art and vice versa, it's somehow surreal that it's precisely the same boundaries that Portman's character Nina the ballerina has to break through in order to own her role as the Swan Queen in Swan Lake. It's also deals with the perils of getting too absorbed into a role to the point of obsession, having that line that separates reality and fantasy get really blurred, to the detriment of the self-absorbed thespian, and here we observe Nina's horrific metamorphosis from all things good to a mean, and psychotic even, streak.One of the highlights of the film is how layered Andre Heinz's story is, taking place on many planes and even running parallel to that in real life with Natalie Portman taking on an adult role, and of course that between her character Nina and the Swan Queen in Swan Lake. Like the latter, Nina becomes a little bit paranoid that her lucky run may just get derailed by the introduction of another talented dancer Lily (Mila Kunis), who has that extra X-factor to outshine her, and similar to the taking away of the Prince of her dreams, would actually get an outside chance to steal her dream leading role from right under her nose, something that she (and any other ballerina in a troupe) would covert through all means possible.You can just about see how this film is like a companion piece to Aronofsky's The Wrestler, with both taking place in niche entertainment circles that call for being at the physical peak, as well as countless of hours in training just to be able to entertain an audience, gain fans, admirers and followers, and wow when the lights come on in the ring or stage. Character wise, they're of the opposite ends, with one being at the twilight of one's career, and the other given a window of opportunity to shine.But back to Natalie Portman, her performance here is nothing less than magnificent, and like many other actors before her, she too her undergone some physical transformation to be that zero fat ballerina with impeccable graces, doing a great job in bringing forth her character's constant obsession with perfection, pummeling herself in training if she's not meeting her own incredible standards. We witness her transformation from innocence to rebellious in that quest to, as advised, transcend what she already is, into something she isn't and overcoming her inhibitions, thereby adding a surprising wow factor in her performance. It is this transformation all within the film, that will make one sit up and take notice as she tussles from nice, to bad, to somewhere in between.Like its fellow Oscar contender The Fighter, Black Swan also boasts wonderful performances from its supporting cast. Mila Kunis as Lily was great as the competition who always seem to be inching closer and closer as a bona fide replacement should Nina finally get pushed over the edge, and provides constant fodder for Nina to always look over her shoulder. Vincent Cassell also always look comfortable playing slimy roles, and as the artistic director of the ballet company that's seeking new funding through a new production with a promising new lead, makes enough moves on Nina that you can on one hand feel he's taking advantage of the ingénue, yet on the other hand knows just all the right buttons to push to get a performance of a lifetime from his ballerinas. Winona Ryder has a small role here as the discarded ballerina has-been, and Barbara Hershey shines as the protective mom of Nina's who's constant fussing over her daughter and her prospective successes which becomes a confirmed recipe for exploding past the stifling environment she provides Nina with.I was also looking forward to listening to Clint Mansell's score in this film since he has so far scored most, if not all, of Aronofsky's films, but somehow it got drowned out. Be warned though that not only is this film an effective psychological thriller with plenty of reflective surfaces in almost all the scenes to peel into the inner world of Nina and her inevitable change, but it is also as effective somehow as a horror film toward the latter half with its frightening scenes, employing some of the usual bag of tricks in raking up the good old fashion scares to a successful degree. Definitely highly recommended, although I will advice to seek out a more complete film elsewhere rather than to head to the cinemas for a disrespectful, mutilated cut.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Although I do think Aronofsky makes some decent work, I am no member of his fan-club or anything. Much of his movies seem distant to me. Too distant to be in any way involved or even interested in the story that unfolds. Much of the time Aronofsky is trying to hard to show something sophisticated and intelligent. Usually he succeeds in some way or another, but with Black Swan he misses the mark. By miles! The story consists of nothing more than a ballerina (at the top of her game)who is cracking under the pressure of starring in Swan Lake. It is all visualized by cheap horror clichés and some rather tasteless sex-scenes. The worst part is that from the first few minutes of the film, it is pretty clear where were all headed. And no, the movie does not surprise us with a nice twist. It is what it is.I can only shrug my shoulders.The only thing that keeps me puzzled with this movie, is the fact that a lot of people seem to think it is a masterpiece.

Deivers on every level,"Black Swan is a movie about a ballet dancer who has been chosen for the role of the prestigious swan. Her instructor tells her that she is perfect for the white swan but that the black one doesn't need perfection( which she has) but feeling and losing of control. So as you might have suspected she starts to change mysterious into the black swan.The movie is directed by Daren Aronofsky whom you might know from ""The Wrestler"" or the superb ""Requiem for a Dream"". What anyone could see here is his confidence in handling the material. He uses lots of shaky camera work which kind of irritated me at first but I can see the importance in the long term. It gives the movie an unpleasant and daunting mood which the movie needs.The movie is also very literal(but not hard to understand) which makes you admire the apt script writers. As for the acting, Natalie Portman is nothing short of breath taking. This is the kind of movie you would call a directors movie but Natalie pulls it to the other side and almost makes it an actors movie. I just couldn't imagine anyone else in this role.Part of the reason i called this a directors movie is the ending which couldn't have been made better. Movies like this usually fall in to two categories by the end, she either gives a good performance or she doesn't, bur Aronofsky takes it to a whole new dimension.I always say if a movie has a great script, wonderful acting and exhilarating direction it deserves to be seen.

Then the dark can swallow you whole without any chance to survive and become the previous version of yourself...The film ""Black Swan"" can push you to start thinking about above-mentioned, about perfection and idealism overall. Some things in our life we try to do perfectly. Pressure from many aspects could change our personality and all our wishes might be only about being perfect. But nobody knows how it is incredibly hard to achieve the highest level in a perfomance. In this film one specific subject was revealed. It's a ballet. However, in my opinion, the showing story could happen in any sphere.
Here is one ballerina, being always under control and over loved from her mother, having only one dream in her life to be a great artist, she embodied herself into a character giving away whole her mind and soul to this performance. Actually, it was real and breathtaking performance if only it wasn't the last performance in her life. It shows us that artists really put all their physical and emotional efforts in their performances. People can reach glory only in this way and many of us couldn't image how hard it could be. And really, geniuses and successful people might become the most outstanding people only by sacrificing something and it is a bitter true.But if we really think about this deeply and carefully, we can realize that it doest't worth all the torments. People are really becoming crazy on the way to achive a success. They lose humanity and empathy to each other trying to achive their own goals. But it's not the main problem, the worst thing that they become to hate theirselves without seeing any progress. And now worth thinking about this, is it really worth of this?

The annoyance of madness,"Dominatrix mom + unstable girl + sexual inhibition + a pathological desire for perfection = psychiatric disaster.I was left with an undecipherable feeling after watching this movie. I took about two hours for me to define this feeling: pure annoying, with some gloomy tint. The movie itself is kind of well crafted, and definitely well acted, but the way in which story unfolds is just annoying, and the main character's descent into madness, although linear, is ... (can I use the same word again?) annoying. There is something about this movie I don't really understand. Why is the story embedded in the context of ballet? The same story could easily fit in any other context: a scientist's descent into madness, a student's descent into madness, a security guard's descent into madness, a cop's descent into madness, a painter's descent into madness, a musician descent into madness... you name it. In some way, this movie is not compact, but glued, I mean, the ballet thing is kind of gratuitous. I get suspicious when I see a story glued to a context, when there's not natural unity. This kind of movies usually have a cocky message. ""Hey, we know about ballet, about art, about philosophy of art, we are an elite, we have been in art school, and we know what peasants don't know"". ""If you don't like this art-tinted movie, you are an ignorant"" ""If you like it, then you know about art"". What is the point anyways?

Littered throughout is unforgettable imagery, dark themes all woven together with a loud and menacing score.Black Swan is a great film, not one I think I'd watch again but it does what it seeks out to do.

Black Swan - 4.5 Stars,"Nina Sayers wakes up in the morning and shares the marvelous dream she had with her single mother, Erica. She was on stage, performing the lead role in Tchaikovsky's ballet masterpiece, ""Swan Lake."" Other hard- working female ballet dancers also dream of this role, and with great reason. To star in an event of this magnitude is not only to share your love for this art. It also provides an opportunity on the grandest scale to finally show the world the passion that you, for so long, spent years to perfect.The ballet company that Nina occupies is starting a new season, and its director, Thomas (Vincent Cassel), is looking for a new star. Nina is eventually chosen, but the preparations will not be easy. She is required to play two characters of opposite nature, the White Swan and the Black Swan. Disciplined, controlled, and performing according to technique, Nina is a candidate who is more than ideal for the White Swan. But she lacks the qualities that are essential to embody the Black Swan, which demands her to follow feelings, and not methods.Nina's responsibility indeed asks much of her, but ballet in itself is a grueling practice. It's ironic how the graceful gestures and elegant movements that ballet creates are achieved through continuous punishment of the body. Those who master this craft withstand tremendous pain until they adapt to actions the human body was never designed to do. Such training could damage the mind as much as it could hurt the limbs, and we slowly and fearfully learn how badly this has affected Nina herself. Things are only about to get worse.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/black-swan-movie-review/",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
This is not an easy movie,"Simply put, this is not an easy movie to watch. Ballerinas, a status that is acquired through painstaking practices and determination, is always mysterious. This movie uncovered the shadow behind their glorious careers on stage. While it is fiction, it describes the internal and external pressures, the rise and fall of careers, the competition among peers, the stereotypes for ballerinas, and most of all, the sheer will behind a perfect performance. Through out this movie, Natalie Portman's restrained character faces every type of blood, sweat, and tears to perfect herself. The movie's intensity, realism, and Natale Portman's superb acting make this a difficult yet rewarding watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Black Swan,"I watched twice this film in three days, after the second view, it still fascinates me so much, which makes it easily crack into my top 3 list of 2010.The film is the twin of Darren's last feature THE WRESTLER (2008), the quasi-identical path of a person pursues perfection in his/her life which requests huge sacrifice which he/she doesn't expect until the last moment of the finale. The tour-de-force performance by Natalie Portman is so magnetic insofar as to keep audience stick to their seats for the entire show and when the curtain falls, hailing her as the best performance of the year! I don't want to exaggerate how wonderful she is in interpreting two opposed role with perfect precision. Numerous BEST ACTRESS AWARDS cannot be wrong. The supporting cast is excellent as well, and Mila Kunis stands out distinctively as the imaginary black swan and the scintilla between her and Natalie slowly gives off as the film goes on until the peak moment. Also Barbara Hershey returns with a mighty and slightly creepy role as Natalie's control-freak mother and Vincent and Winona use great effort to become existential in their own ways.Another important merit of the film is its Darren's mastery as a director, the shaky-cum- close DV style captures every inch of the emotional turbulence of our swan queen and conveys to us a vividly on-the-scene wallop. Plus who could resist the elegant ballet choreography? The final showdown on the stage is done marvelously without any letup.The film is glutted with many nail-broken, blood-leaking, skin coming-off scenes, and by all means it is not an easy film suitable for everyone, but I recommend to anyone who would like to experience some mind-blowing brainwashing, this film will not fail you.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Simply Awesome,"I am not someone who is very fond of writing reviews but if I don't write something about this movie, it would be nothing less than sacrilege. A master piece like Black Swan deserves all the praise in the world. I have enjoyed watching other movies also from director Darren Aronofsky but Black Swan is a notch higher than the rest. He has clearly outperformed himself.Credit is also due to him for his cast selection. Natalie Portman was the perfect choice for this role which she carried off flawlessly. The metamorphosis of her character has been described beautifully. It seems like she were a picture, the director a painter and with every brush stroke the picture radiates darker and darker hues. The whole experience of watching this movie is so intense that it lingers on in your mind much beyond those 2 hours.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Beautiful. Horrifying. Exhilarating.,"Darren Aronofsky originally intended to make a single film about a love affair between a wrestler and a ballerina. That didn't work out as planned, and so 'The Wrestler' (2008) was made first, with 'Black Swan' following two years later. Despite being divided into separate stories, the films remain as companion pieces. The ring and the stage are entirely different worlds, but the films examine a common theme: the destruction of oneself for the sake of performance. Aronofsky tackles the idea with a more edgy approach this time round, but there is no doubt that the two films are opposite sides of the same coin.Ballet dancer Nina (Natalie Portman) is determined to land the leading role in her company's production of Tchaikovsky's 'Swan Lake'. Her innocence, elegance and delicacy make her a perfect candidate for the White Swan, one half of the character. The same traits prevent her from playing the titular Black Swan, which is aggressive, seductive and dark. As Nina struggles to embody both halves of the character, she begins to lose her grip on reality. Things are made worse by an oppressive mother, an imposing director and a talented rival who threatens to snatch the role away.Portman does a phenomenal job as Nina. She plays her emotions and her frailty with such conviction that her mental disintegration feels natural and credible. Her dedication to the role is obvious – shrinking down to unhealthy proportions and training tirelessly for a year transformed her into a proper ballerina. Even more impressively, she manages to act and keep up with the crazy choreography at the same time, doing both so flawlessly that an Oscar is inevitable.The camera-work by Matthew Libatique perfectly communicates the frantic nature of the story. Mirrors are used creatively, and the liberal use of the close-up, especially during the dancing, creates a claustrophobic atmosphere that compliments the film's sinister nature. Clint Mansell's score is a brilliantly creepy reworking of Tchaikovsky's pieces. It is an effective composition, perfectly reflecting the film's mix of beauty and menace.Somewhat disappointingly, the first half of 'Black Swan' is a little slow, with an over-emphasis on setting up the story. There is also perhaps slightly too great a focus on the dancing. However, the pace allows for the mood to build and build until a truly insane final act that delivers a satisfying payoff.The works of Cronenberg, Polanski and Lynch - all of them masters of uncomfortable cinema - echo throughout. 'Black Swan' combines the body horror of 'The Fly', the paranoia of 'The Tenant', and the surrealism of 'Mulholland Drive' in a blend of menace so varied that it keeps the audience genuinely uneasy throughout. Yet Aronofsky does not rely on others to hold up his film. He has taken the tools crafted by others and created for himself a refreshingly demented film. In his own way, he combines beauty and perfection with madness and paranoia. Ballet is meant to be graceful, but the mood that Aronofsky creates is one of frenzy. There are scary films, and there are are beautiful films, and it is in the juxtaposition of the two that Aronofsky triumphs.Over the years, Aronofsky has built himself a solid reputation for making films that are difficult to put in a box, and 'Black Swan' is no different. It doesn't know if it wants to be beautiful or ugly, so it is a mash-up of both. It aims to seduce and repulse at the same time, and it succeeds. Never has a film been so simultaneously elegant and vulgar. It is uncomfortable and occasionally nasty, and yet it is one of the most exhilarating in recent cinema.",,Anonymous,Drama
Ballet good show,"At last ""The Red Shoes"" has some competition. An imaginatively daring movie with ballet as its main theme, with Natalie Portman cast in the title role as the shy but ambitious ingénue who unexpectedly wins the prize part of lead dancer in a new production of ""Swan Lake"" and then finds herself pressurised into exploring the suppressed darker side if her on character to meet the demands of the part. The director really piles on the agony for her with almost clichéd characters of her pushy mother, handsome but exploitative director and jealously competitive rivals in the troop, but by constantly changing perspective, the viewer is never sure just what is going on. The camera is almost always in Portman's face or over her shoulder, conveying her growing paranoia and while her nightmare could on one level be easily attributed to a bad drug trip, she clearly had problems beforehand. I wasn't completely comfortable with some of the modernising aspects of the story, like the lesbian love scene, drug-taking and even the suggestion of incest, but there's no denying the dark momentum as her torment with some genuinely thrilling if disturbing moments on the way to her final apotheosis in the title part, especially the scene where she literally metamorphoses into the Black Swan character as she triumphantly overcomes a fall in her performance. The acting is a mixture of the stylised and naturalistic, contrasting the everyday with the other-worldly. There are no doubt deeper psychological interpretations open about Portman's Nina character with her awakening sexuality and mother complex prominent amongst them but I preferred to just watch the film as an oddly old-fashioned backstage melodrama and be swept along like the great ballet and of course wonderfully florid music it takes as its starting point. In this day and age of SFX comic-hero blockbusters, I was glad to engage with an old- fashioned if over-the-top psychological thriller which certainly kept me on my toes (sorry!) throughout.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Good for what it is.,"Saw this film tonight, and was impressed. This story of a woman (Portman) who is overtaken by the evil black swan as she prepares for her first performance as a principal dancer was quite frightening at times.Barbara Hershey (botox and all) did a great job as the stage mother in this film.Although this is by no means a Oscar level film (I was very surprised to see it nominated) Portman does give an Oscar winning performance in the lead.A little above a popcorn movie I highly recommend this film to all lovers of dance.In many ways it captures the behind the scenes look and feel of what I saw with women who trained with the hopes of a professional dancing career with the twist of a woman who has gone beyond the normal stressors of someone under this type of pressure.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
What happened to my sweet girl?,"Wow is the one word reaction I had to Black Swan, a truly dark and surreal tale about the world of ballet from Darren Aronofsky.Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a talented young ballerina who get her technique down perfectly, but has a very meek personality. She has a controlling mother (Barbara Hershey) who does not allow her daughter to grow up, with Nina ending up having a young personality and there is a possible history of self-harm. Nina is up for the role of a life time, playing both the White Swan and the Black Swan in Swan Lake. The ballet director Thomas (Vincent Cassel) believes Nina is perfect to play the White Swan but too nice to play the Black Swan. Despite this Nina is cast in the role, but she has to explore her dark side, having an affair with Thomas, have dark images of herself following her and herself bleeding and worrying about another dancer, Lily (Mila Kunis) wanting to replace her.Darren Aronofsky is of course a skilled director and after playing it safe with The Wrestler took a risk again with this ambitious film. Black Swan is a really crazy film, many thinks are going off in this film and it was a schizophrenic experience. Aronofsky has shown with both The Wrestler and Black Swan that he can take something that is light entertainment and turn into something dark and seedy. Aronofsky is not afraid to look at the darker side of life and what it would take to be a ballerina, discipline, staying thin (by any means possible), having affairs, etc and Aronofsky is able to mix dark fantasy with real life. I personally love Aronofsky's use of hand-held camera, giving Black Swan a more intense feeling, using close up and it was great when the camera spins around the actors when their dance. It gives the audience the feeling of what it is like to dance and being in the studio. As the film become more surreal it reminded me of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, a film that become very confusing by the third act. A scene I really like is when Nina and Lily are in the club with a coloured strobe light, making the characters look like they pictures as they jerkily move when the light goes on and off. It is very much what it is like in a nightclub and the Chemical Brothers music was fitting.The acting in the film is great. Of course Portman is a talented actress and it is likely that she will get the Oscar, Jennifer Lawrence will be considered too young by the academy. I like how her character was pretty much like a 13-year-old girl who still needs to grow and get out of her shell. Kunis shows that will the right direction she can be a good actress (she was much better then to her role in The Book of Eli). She was a strange, bad girl, smoking, drinking, taking drugs and acting almost like a femme fatal. The story and relationship between Nina and Lily could have worked if the characters were teenagers, Nina being a naïve young girl being led astray by a more experience girl. Hershey too was good as Nina's mother, a woman using her daughter to live out her dreams and treating her as a doll, dressing her and controlling her life. The relationship is almost like Norman Bates the early years. This follows a long running theme in Afonosky, dysfunctional relationships between a parent and their child, but this time Nina's mum does love her, but goes about it the wrong way. Cassel is effectively creepy as a man who seduces dancers, touches them inappropriately, yet silver tongued.Clint Mansel is a great composer and he has worked with Aronofsky before. He gave Black Swan an incredible, booming score. He composes his own music with the music of Swan Lake to great affect and my God was it fantastic.But I do have a problem with the film and that is why the filmmakers did not know which direction they wanted to go. They did not know where to focus it as a grounded tale of a girl going mad, living in her mother's shadow, as a dark horror of someone going through metamorphosis, a tale of a girl being followed by someone trying to take own her live or any of the other themes and ideas in the film. Black Swan needed more focus.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Unnecessarily Unpleasant,"This has all the pieces of a special film but I can't help but think that it seriously missed the mark. I think it's trying too hard is what it comes down to. I enjoy subjectivity and feeling uneasy while watching something but there are too many lazy plot points to ignore. There are so many unnecessary little occurrences that are in the film for no other reason than to cause uneasiness. They don't move the story along and they don't add a tense layer to the movie, they simply make me not want to watch. The story, itself, is interesting but the movie is just unnecessarily unpleasant for too long. Portman and Kunis do well with their roles but Portman's character is far too annoying at times. I understand all of these visions she has are products of mental illness that is derived from her unusual home-life and uncompromising commitment to her work but a lot of the film just doesn't work for me. I'm a very big proponent of showing things instead of always saying them but Black Swan takes pieces of information that might have been better off implied and brazenly puts them on screen, often in a manner that comes off as cheap. I admire the idea behind the film but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
Amazing performance by Natalie Portman,"This is a very difficult film to describe, and as many have already done so, perhaps I should not struggle too hard to give an account of it. The film is chiefly notable for the amazing performance of Natalie Portman as the character Nina Sayers, a young ballet dancer who is chosen to dance the lead in a new production of SWAN LAKE, where she has to play both the 'good' white swan and the 'bad' black swan. This leads to her having a psychological crisis, where she splits into a dual personality of the good Nina and the bad Nina. The idea is frankly rather contrived, but the film is very powerful despite this, and Natalie Portman, who has been taking dancing lessons since the age of 4, miraculously becomes a prima ballerina on the screen. Ever since she appeared in LEON in 1994, Natalie Portman has been attracting attention by her remarkable presence, personality, and ability. She has even directed two short films and has now become an executive producer. Is there no limit to her talents? This film has a lot of unnecessarily prurient scenes, and sexual content which some will find highly objectionable. Portman sturdily hangs onto her clothes and refuses to do nude scenes, and good for her. She is not a 'lets show em me tits' gal at all. But there may well have been a struggle over this with the director, Darren Aronofsky, for the way he does extreme close-ups of her bottom and makes her masturbate on screen suggests that he may be a 'rip their clothes off' kinda guy. Maybe the microscopic study of Portman's bottom was his revenge for being denied a sight of her tits. It certainly looks that way. Anyway, I am very glad that Portman kept her tits to herself, because it was absolutely unnecessary for her to do otherwise. Actresses do need to resist lecherous directors and producers more than they do. The new production has been devised by a dynamic character played by the ever-versatile French star Vincent Cassel, who seems to know every language (I once saw him speaking fluent Portuguese in a film, and that ain't easy to pronounce). Here he yatters away in English as if he had been born in America. I would not say that he was the ideal casting choice, but I can appreciate that the director was trying to find someone a bit more cosmopolitan than the average American movie star, as they are mostly so provincial and culturally unsophisticated that the idea of one of them directing a ballet would be a joke. Portman's mother is played by Barbara Hershey, who does an excellent job as a frustrated and thwarted stage-mother who has some deep psychological issues herself. This film is a very powerful and disturbing emotional experience, and is extremely well made. If one sets aside the fact that the whole premise of the story is extremely contrived, it can sweep you away for 108 minutes. I have known a number of ballet dancers, a few very well, and I never came across any who were genuinely and thoroughly bonkers, but maybe they really do exist out there somewhere. I suppose they must do. Everybody else is crazy, so why not also ballet dancers? Certainly Natalie Portman is so convincing that she must have inspired shivers down the spines of millions of people by now. Mila Kunis, a Ukrainian Jewish girl with a slangy American accent, is also brilliant as Portman's rival, the dancer Lily. She is not only sexually liberated, she is positively promiscuous and wild, whereas Portman's character is repressed and virginal. These two play well against each other, and generate a lot of sparks. Certainly that was an act of casting which thoroughly worked. Kunis also does a lot of spectacular dancing. This whole production is extremely impressive, and the film deserved its great success.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Dark. Uncomfortable. Unrelenting. Amazing.,"""I felt it. Perfect. It was perfect.""Some directors make movies that are ""experiences"". Darren Aronofsky is one of those directors.Black Swan is a combination of the unbearable descent into hallucinatory madness featured in Requiem for a Dream, and the unflinching pain and physical drive to be one thing and one thing only, as seen in The Wrestler (and those just happen to be my two favorite Aronofsky movies). The marriage of those two elements is a fascinating movie that's frightening, uncomfortable, and tries its hardest to make it difficult for you to keep your eyes on the screen, even as you're riveted by what you see.Portman is amazing. The camera is almost always tight on her, just as the pressure of her mother, her ballet director, and her rivals is always pressed oppressively close against her. This is not the story of a normal woman coming unraveled. Nina is frayed from the first moment we meet her, both physically and mentally.I've never been a massive Portman fan, but I always thought that she was a nice enough actress. Here, she impresses with not only her ballet skills, but her ability to communicate fear, frustration,  obsession, and psychosis.Mila Kunis puts in another solid performance in the string of good movies that's she's been in the last few years. She's simultaneously threatening and endearing. Vincent Cassel is suffocating and terrifying (from Nina's point of view, which is also our point of view) as the ballet director. Barbara Hershey is overbearing and disturbingly motherly, as Nina's mom, and puts perhaps the greatest burden of stress on Nina's shoulders.Black Swan feels like an Aronofsky film, through and through. His fingerprints are all over it. His camera style, the way he brings the audience in and makes them feel a part of the character, and experience in a way what the character is experiencing. This is not a movie for everyone. It's horror, but a psychological kind of horror that puts us directly into the fractured, overwhelmed, frustrated mind of a person.After only one viewing, Black Swan hasn't quite replaced The Wrestler as my favorite Aronofsky movie. But, it is clearly his most interesting film by far, as well as his most artistic and his most technically spectacular.Black Swan crawled under my skin, and I can't wait to see it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Drowning in Swan Lake,"Darren Aronofsky is a pure film artist, one of the best of his generation. His specialty comes with exploring characters that are coming apart under the stress of paranoia, yet he never makes his films boring or depressing. It is exciting to watch his characters thrash about, trying to get a handle on their situation. With his 1998 debut Pi, he examined a paranoid mathematician who was trying to unlock the coded patterns of the universe. In 2000's Requiem for a Dream, he followed Ellen Burstyn (in a brilliant performance) into a diet pill addiction that led to a rubber room. Then with The Wrestler two years ago, he followed the fall and disgrace of a former professional wrestler played by Mickey Rourke whose life goes from bad to worse.Those were great films but I think he has finally found the best arena for his kind of melodrama: ballet. Black Swan is a gorgeous looking but sometimes horrifying story (as great ballets sometimes are) about a woman so obsessed with perfection that she ends up losing her marbles. Aronofsky uses Swan Lake as a template to tell a story that is both grounded in reality and in flights of terrifying fancy.Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayer, a fragile spirit who was pushed into the world of ballet by her domineering mother (Barbara Hershey), and now occupies a place in the New York Ballet Company. Under the tutelage of the demanding company director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), Nina is poised for the lead in the new production of Swan Lake, which has been recast after Thomas ousted the former lead Beth McEntyre (Winona Ryder). Pushed between Thomas, her mother, and her obsession with perfecting her dancing (set off when Thomas tells her that she has the chops to play the white swan but not the black one), Nina's mind is coming apart. Added to that stress is the presence of a new member to the company, a free-spirit named Lily (Mila Kunis) who Nina fears will take her place.This sounds like the standard, ordinary backstage drama - All About Eve in a tutu - but the movie is focused squarely at Nina's point of view and makes her journey into a dark and seductive thriller. Nina sees things that aren't there, like injures to her fingers and back (if you know the basic structure of Swan Lake, you quickly deduce why). She becomes paranoid about losing her part. She thinks Lily is out to sabotage her. She sees herself doing things in the mirror that she is not doing in reality.There is a stark and frightening melodrama at work here but also a fascinating mystery. The more you understand the basic plot of Swan Lake, the quicker you will understand what is happening to Nina. Yet, even if you don't, the underlying mystery unfolds beautifully leading to one of the most exhilarating final acts that I have seen in a movie in years. Finally, like a breath of fresh air, it is nice to see a movie whose ending isn't telegraphed from the beginning.Natalie Portman is a revelation here. I've been watching her for years in a variety of roles both good and bad but something came out of her in this movie that I didn't expect. I know that she is a wonderful actor but I wasn't aware that she was such a good re-actor. Most actors stand by, waiting for the moment but Portman knows how to play to a situation. Here she is asked to play a character who is in a constant state of stress and confusion. She wears the pain right at the center of her face and around her eyes. If her performance seems somewhat overwrought, then consider that ballet itself thrives on that very thing.That's what makes the movie work and why the third act is such a kicker. We've followed this young woman on a strange journey and, in the end, we are taken down to her inevitable fate. But the finale isn't the point, it is the strange journey getting there. The film is lurid and grotesque but it finds a balance of tone that keeps us watching. This is Aronofsky's best film and, to my taste, the best film of 2010.**** (of four)",,Anonymous,Drama

Darkness at the Soul of BLACK SWAN,"Director Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Requiem for a Dream) has done some offbeat films but has always elicited strong performances from his leads. Perhaps his greatest achievement is getting an Oscar worthy performance from Natalie Portman in Black Swan, a film that does an impressive job of depicting a psychological downward spiral of a competitive ballerina in the role of a lifetime.Nina Sayers (Portman) works hard at her craft and gets the coveted starring role in Swan Lake. Doted on by her mother (Barbara Hershey in an unusual role) and pushed to extremes by her ballet director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), she begins to feel threatened and becomes delusional and loses touch with reality. A new arrival, Lily (Mila Kunis), understudies her and becomes not only her friend and night scene companion, but also her main competitor and threat. Is she undermining her on purpose or is Nina just imagining it all? As opening night approached, the visions become even more disturbing to the point that Nina is at the brink of her sanity and the curtain opens on the most important moment of her life.Portman projects a complex series of conflicting emotions including anxiety, jealousy, and even guilt as if she does not deserve the lead. Guided by Aronofsky, she soars as she has never done before. Not only does she perform a substantial amount of physically demanding ballet, but we see things through her eyes and feel her pains. Does she really commit the horrible acts she thinks she may have done or is it all in her warped mind? It's not a pleasant journey. There is extremely disturbing use of mirror images that reflect Nina's face and become Lily in the next instant in jarring and unexpected fashion. Is Nina seeing Lily or is it a reflection of her own self? A moment that shows the various pieces of wall art at her home coming alive in nightmarish figures is truly unnerving.Kunis as Lily brings enough menace to her role. Winona Ryder has a supporting role of a retiring, vindictive ballerina, Beth MacIntyre, who ends up in the hospital. A scene where Nina worships Beth is reminiscent of Anne Baxter and Bette Davis in the dressing room scene of All About Eve. Beth is bitter and even self abusive which kind of foreshadows what awaits Nina. Cassell is effective as the ballet director whose sexism and unusual methods are suspect but never his quest for the absolute best for his production. Hershey registers as an overly concerned, controlling mom.The film does a good job of showing the mental and physical toll that rehearsal and practice take on a performer, and to make matters worse, the angst exhibits itself seemingly on Nina's body in distorted and grotesque manifestations. The physical mutations would probably amuse and please the likes of David Cronenberg and David Lynch. As Leroy demands more than what she shows in technique, she knows she has to give everything in her soul and more to satisfy the ballet's demands. There is an interesting dichotomy showing two sides of a ballerina's psyche with the repressed, uptight Nina whose frigidity is counterpointed by the free spirited and sensual Lily. Lily evens brings out her sexuality and inner yearning that seems all too real, or is it a dream? Something that is never mentioned or shown is if Nina is a virgin or ever had a real boyfriend. Then there is the duality within Nina of White and Black Swans in which the dark side must emerge if she is to fully inhabit the lead role.Much of the film recalls other memorable films that bend reality like The Fight Club or Affliction, and Nina's descent into madness has striking similarities to Roman Polanski's classic Repulsion whose woman descends into psychological delusions and paranoia.Aronofsky's use of camera work is startling as it works in concert with Portman's performance, and when you see the change in her eyes near the end, it is stunning. The film employs lots of hand-held shots with cinematographer Matthew Libatique to visualize a subjective viewpoint for Nina. The score by Clint Mansell is well done with a touch of foreboding. Both of them are Aronofsky veterans. The final scene as Nina readies to perform the last act as she morphs into the Black Swan to complete her transformation is haunting. The final shot is unforgettable. Some viewers may be turned off by its repellent imagery but others will be astonished by a powerful depiction of madness at any price.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Brilliant but no bang,"It would've garnered 9 stars if it had had a bigger payoff. As it was, it barely squeaked by. Natalie Portman is dynamite as Nina, a sexually repressed and unstable woman who begins to lose her mind under the pressure of impending stardom and her own perfectionism. Her real life and her stage life intertwine to the point where real people become characters from ""Swan Lake"" and vice versa. (Even the credits list people as their ""real"" role and the characters they represent.) Clearly, the story would have more meaning if one is familiar with ""Swan Lake"", but it wasn't necessary. I was simply hoping for a bigger bang. Aronofsky builds the suspense to the level of ""Diabolique"", and I was hoping to be floored by a similar ending.

An intoxicating film,"Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan (2010) intoxicates its audience with compelling art-house thrills. This is the kind of film that reminds us why we love the cinema so much. 2010 was a year filled with box office flops—major disappointments in prequels, sequels, and remakes. Finally Aronofsky hits us up with something fresh and genuine, something that finally gets the wheels turning up there. When ballerina, Nina (Natalie Portman) is cast as the two part lead in Swan Lake, she easily proves herself as the graceful and innocent White Swan. It is the dual role as the cunning and seductive Black Swan that will be the challenge, especially with Lily (Mila Kunis) standing as a major threat to Nina's shining moment. This fantasy drama takes you on a surreal ride through the mind of an obsessive perfectionist—one who is certainly 'losing it', if you know what I mean. It is a glimpse at the underbelly of ballet, an act we so often understand to be glamorous and beautiful. Black Swan is wildly over the top and will have you thinking about its content and imagery for hours, even after leaving the theatre. The narrative's ambiguity is what makes it so fun to watch. It is a film you must see more than once, taking a different mindful approach every time. So many interpretations! Natalie Portman gives an outstanding performance and any recognition given to her because of it is well worth it. Definitely a smart career move.

Ferocious psychological filmmaking at its finest,"While from a distance ballet may look like it is filled with elegance and grace, in reality ballerinas must possess incredible strength, flexibility and unwavering dedication if they wish to succeed in such a physically demanding profession. It is therefore not so surprising that the latest film from director Darren Aronofsky focuses on a New York ballet company and their performance of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. From washed up wrestlers to reclusive mathematicians, Spanish conquistadors and Coney Island drug addicts, all of Aronofsky's films – π, Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain and The Wrestler – have been centered around characters who become dangerously, singularly obsessed. In Black Swan, the character is Nina, a shy, timorous young dancer played magnificently by Natalie Portman. Her fixation? The leading role of The Swan Queen. Filled with nightmarish intensity, gripping melodrama, steamy eroticism and occasional camp, Black Swan is a captivating tale of a woman consumed by her quest for perfection, and a visceral cinematic experience from one of the true visionary directors of today.Swan Lake, the story of a princess transformed by an evil sorcerer into a beautiful white swan, is one of the most famed ballets in history. It's most interesting aspect is that its lead ballerina is required to dance two parts; the graceful white swan, as well as the sultry black swan, the seductress who steals the white swans love. For Nina, the role represents her shot at stardom, as well as the chance to finally prove herself to her domineering mother (Barbara Hershey), a woman whose overbearing personality has trapped Nina is a state of perpetual childhood. Nina's innocence however, is soon to be shattered. Forced to contend with the jealousy of her fellow dancers, the sexual advances of the company's lecherous director (Vincent Cassel) and the enormous pressures of perfecting her technique, Nina grasp on reality begins to slip. Haunted by terrifying hallucinations, her paranoia is given form in the appearance of Lily, a beautiful and uninhibited new dancer who represents everything the obsessive, sexually repressed Nina is not.Natalie Portman has always been a solid performer, but her work in Black Swan is indisputably a career best. The feelings of fear and pain that Nina experiences – both mental and physical – are palpable in this all-encompassing performance, one that demands of Portman both the utmost emotional expression and a physicality every bit as straining as Mickey Rourke's in Aronofksy's previous film, The Wrestler. Once again, this masterful pulls back the curtain to reveal the hidden agonies of performance as entertainment; in Black Swan, ballet is portrayed not as art but as near torture, the excruciating physical feats Nina attempts depicted with a sickening, gut-wrenching realism. The emotional abuse Nina suffers at the hands of her coworkers, director and psychopathic mother is similarly horrifying, so much so that even at the beginning of the film, her psychosis is already beginning to peek through. Portman's transformation, through fear and madness, from the quiet and dainty dancer Nina was – her mother's ""sweet girl"" – to the furious, powerful, sexually eruptive creature she becomes by the films end, is utterly enthralling to behold.The technical prowess Aronofsky displays in this film is quite simply incredible. The use of stark digital cinematography irritated me at first, but as the film progressed I soon reevaluated my initial impressions. This is a gritty, claustrophobic film, and the inelegant visual aesthetic is an essential part of the movies tone, be it in its portrayal of dance, sex or paranoid dreams. As Nina's mind begins to descent further into madness, her disturbing hallucinations, full of images of self-harm, bodily transformation and erotic decadence, all feel graphically, often frighteningly real. The film's production design is also terrific; a single look at Nina's bedroom tells you everything you need to know about her character and home environment. Likewise, in almost every scene a mirror is present, reflecting the dual nature of Nina's role and personality, both of which threaten to destroy her. These and other motifs did strike me as a tad obvious, but ultimately Black Swan is less concerned with avoiding clichés as it is with the establishment of a dark and thrilling atmosphere; in this regard, it is almost perfect.Speaking of atmosphere, the use of sound in Black Swan is absolutely astounding. Clint Mansell has scored every one of Aronofsky's films, and between Requiem for the Dream and The Fountain has crafted some of the best and most iconic film music of all time. Compared to his work on those films, the Black Swan score is far less bombastic; instead, Mansell reinforces moments of fear, triumph, eroticism and despair with precise classical pieces, often incorporating themes from Tchaikovsky's magnificent ballet into his own original tracks. Indeed, by the films frantic and operatic end, it is impossible to tell where Mansell's work ends and Tchaikovsky's begins – the main theme from Swan Lake is used to spectacular effect in the movies climax. Even better than the score however is the film's incredibly evocative sound design. Aronofsky incorporates the noises of cracking bones, heavy breathing, rustling feathers and shattering glass to create an air of constant unease and occasional terror; the subsequent blend of music, sound and striking visuals is heady and intoxicating.In the hands of lesser talent, Black Swan could easily have been a total mess. There are elements within this script, and even within some of the performances (most notably Barbara Hershey's), that would have fitted easily into a day time soap opera or cheesy eighties horror film. Instead, under the technical precession of Darren Aronofsky, and lead by a flooring performance from Natalie Portman, this film is a near masterpiece, one that draws you in with its dark sensuality and twisted, uncontainable energy. This is ferocious psychological filmmaking at its finest.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
No words can describe,"I remember we waited for this movie. The 1st opening night in NYC tri-state area, we couldn't find any theater to see it in NJ. I still wonder why. Only 3 theaters in NYC was playing so we planned our night, hired a babysitter, drove in, spent a night out just for this movie. And the tickets were SOLD OUT. We were so disappointed, and dared to think and try the never-done-before... bought tickets for another movie and tried to sneak in. But we failed badly cause so many people were trying to do the same. They have two staffs guarded the entrance just for this movie. The night was wasted.But we didn't give up. We waited a week and arranged our time carefully. Just before taking the fly to our vacation, we dared to risk missing the fly and spared a few hours from our precious day, jump into the PATH, headed to NYC again.And... it was WORTH IT!!! With all the effort, I've seen the most amazing film of the years. It was bold, daring and truly original. It played the traditional ""Swan Lake"" upside down! Adding so much spicy and excitement on the plain and simple classical Swan Lake. It's a thriller you don't expect... and definitely one of its kind. A true masterpiece... from the way the story was planned, told, unfolded; from the play of the characters (Natalie Portman, the most talented young female actress today, is on her way to become a legend); from mind game it plays on Nina and you. The story is simple and straight forward. Nonetheless, it's simply the best!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A dark tale of perfection,"I was not a big fan of Darren Aronofsky's movies but after watching Black Swan I became one.He always makes exceptional masterpieces like Pi ,Requiem for a Dream etc.Now I am a really big fan of his direction point of views.this movie was a mind bender and during the movie there will be so many questions come to your mind like what the hell is happening ?,what is so wrong ? The main thing I liked of Aronofsky's was that, how he directed the small story in such a long and interesting way.All the scenes were creepy and nicely directed.The background sound was great.Now I am excited to watch Aronofsky's upcoming masterpiece.When it comes to acting,all the actors were not good they were excellent, in their characters.Especially Natalie Portman (who won the Oscar for the best actress for this movie in 2010)was great as Nina.I know it takes a lot of guts to play a character like this and Natalie was really good in it.She also hard worked in learning ballet for this movie and its the cause that I respect her. Mila Kunis and Vincent Cassel were also good.After watching the movie I became a fan of Darren Aronofsky and Natalie Portman.This movie really shows that how can someone be so depressed about their life and work issues and you will also notice very deeply activities and body languages of a depressed person.The story is very unique and what more can I say except this that THIS MOVIE IS ON THE TOP OF MY LIST",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
SEEMED INNOCENT BUT DANGEROUSLY GOOD,"Natalie Portman was a revelation in this psychological thriller by an acclaimed director. Her performance was very worthy of her Oscar win. She was the perfect actress to portray this role. Not only did she executed a perfect balance of innocence and fierceness, she has also showed that a lot of effort by preparing for her role physical-wise. In terms of editing, it was a majestic display of simplicity and interesting tones. The cinematography complemented well with the dark theme of the movie, and the close-up shots of Natalie Portman provided a much-needed closer look at the individuality of her role. Best Darren Aronofsky film by far.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Not black and white,"To understand this, you have to be somewhat familiar with the plot in the ballet ""Swan Lake"". There you find a woman with two different characters, although on the surface two different persons. Often, those parts are danced by the same ballerina.This is what Natalie Portman does here and this may be the performance of her life. There's a struggle inside her, between black and white, and she gets more and more confused about what's reality and what's not. The same goes for the audience.But anyway this is a movie which has, so to say, seen Polanski's ""Repulsion"" a couple of times too much. Or maybe a couple of times too little. The usual ballet clichés are here too. Portman saves it, but can't really save it all.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Black Swan, Graceful as a Duckling","To say that I was highly disappointed in this film would be quite the understatement. While the storyline provides the possibility for a complex character piece, every element of the film is heavy-handed and poorly executed. The screenplay was overly basic, lacking any attempt at creating believable characters. The acting was elementary with no intention of fleshing out character motivation, etc. Perhaps all of this is due to the directing. The cinematography was jumpy and poor, shot much in the manner I would expect from a Horror film. Overall, the movie came off as perfect material for a rushed MTV After-School Special, not an Oscar-nominated flick.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
If you don't like this movie because you know so much about ballet... shut up,"Once I finished the film I immediately went to check the reviews. A lot of them are very positive, although there were a few bad ones. People who dislike this film complain about the reality of the art of ballet depicted in this movie. This movie is NOT a documentary about ballet. So stop whining about 'the dancers weren't even that good'. Who cares? The storyline and actors were amazing.The movie is genius and Natalie Portman plays her role brilliantly. There is a constant tension that keeps you at the edge of your seat until the very end. The downfall of Natalies character is very painful to watch and her descent into madness can so easily be avoided if she'd just 'let go'. But she can't.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
TERRIFYINGLY STUNNING,"Wow. Just wow. The fact that it has taken me until now to watch this movie should be a crime. I was enthralled by the WHOLE movie.For the entire movie, I was trying to guess the ending and the motives behind everyone. I loved that you had no idea what was real and what was not during the movie. It was a trip.The ending blew my mind. I want to experience those last 15 minutes for the first over and over and over again.Natalie Portman was so damn good and I couldn't get over her acting. I will be recommending this movie until I die. It was worth all the types. 10000/10 stars!Already want to watch this again.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
